A state of the art solid bamboo handcrafted ornament
 
 
BODY


For Making the wind wheel we chose bamboo. It's strong structure, light weight and high density, what's make the product light but stable.
 

The circle unit is 10mm thickness which helps to stabilize the wind wheel. the wings are 5mm  what's makes the wind wheel light, so it can spin with the slight wind breeze.
 

The slots of each wing are 10mm wide, what's give the wings enough space to change the angle and open itself when spinning.
 

The wind wheel is designed to spin clockwise as the diagram of the 5 elements. After it's natural spin from the wind it spins back counter-clockwise, as the direction of our solar system spin.

<h3>Project:</h3>
<p>The project incorporates disaster resistance, energy efficiency, water conservation, extended family cohabitation and modern design into one package. As you can see we are still at the stage where the idea is on the page, but we are working now to bring it out of 2D and into construction.  We expect to have the project completed by spring of 2014!</p>
<p>This project is the application of design choices, construction choices, material choices, and system choices to produce a prototype residence that minimizes energy use, water use, provides disaster resistance, longevity, minimal maintenance, and a minimal reliance on outside infrastructure, while preserving modern comfort. The concept is to produce and build a structure with net zero energy use, which can be modified to fit various living requirements, and provides modern comforts all from methods and products, which are currently available!</p>
<p>You may have seen some projects on zero energy use homes, which tend to be smallish (on the order of 1500 sf). This project has slightly loftier goals. With this project, we want to find a way to construct approximately 3500sf living space that can mitigate family fighting, resist natural disasters, and operate with the occasional shortage of resources. The good news is, the design is completed, we have blue prints, we are only a few short steps from receiving building permits and we are about to begin construction. That is where your support comes in. While we realize that this is going to be a home to live in, it is also an opportunity to gather data on how the components and design reflect the goals of minimal resource usage. We are not asking to have you help fund the entire project, just the estimated increase in the costs associated with the design innovations we plan to implement.</p>
<p>We expect to house a family of 6-8 with a mother-in-law section to allow for a ""+2"" residence of extended family. Removal of the basement or the mother in-law sections provides for customization for smaller families. We have investigated a construction envelope of Insulated Concrete Forms (ICF) and we have an envelope of thermal insulation of about R-48, where a larger “R” means less heat loss or gain from the interior so the heating and cooling system requirements are minimized. Most modern homes have R values of R12-R20 in the walls and R30-R42 in the roof. The design of the house includes an orientation and construction which maximizes the passive solar heating available in the winter. We have a large number of windows with a southern exposure which allows for the best orientation with respect to capturing the sun’s warmth. A large thermal mass floor made of concrete is included to retain the winter solar gain as well as roof eaves that minimize the solar heat in the summer.</p>
<p>We have included a roof made of Structural Insulated Panels (SIP) thick enough to match the R48 envelope to maintain the highly insulating envelope integrity. On top of the SIPs insulation we also plan to install a metal roof to help reflect the sun’s heat in the summer and minimize the damage from weather. Solar hot water heating will minimize energy use on heating water and solar photovoltaic cells provide the first source of an expandable generating system to supplement the demand side management implementation of reduced energy usage.</p>
<p>To further reduce the interior climate control requirements, the house is built on an enclosed, conditioned crawl space, which also allows for easy access to the plumbing, electrical, data communication and climate control distribution systems. Added to the design are the system choices, where climate control is through a ground source heat pump with electrical backup, zoned area heat design and wood stove heating redundancy. LED lights and solar tubes will minimize energy spent on lighting, while the 70% sun light penetration will provide natural light through much of the winter day.</p>
<p>Rainwater harvesting will be implemented to provide water to both the toilets and local landscape irrigation and low flow water systems will minimize water use. The design also accommodates a move to gray water harvesting, if and when it is desired.</p>
<p>The foundation is a standard reinforced concrete with footings designed to minimize travel in all directions and a post tension slab on top of the crawlspace to prevent cracking and weakening from ground movement and earthquakes. Ties from the roof are connected through the concrete walls down to the foundation footings to prevent roof loss and increase structural integrity in high wind situations (like tornadoes), and a basement, which also provides a shelter from dangerous weather. The high strength of the prototype envelope will also help prevent damage from other weather conditions like hail, wildfires and ice storms all potential dangers in Oklahoma, where we plan to erect the prototype. We have also designed the prototype will be resistant to organic disasters, like pests. Mice and vermin should have a tough time getting into the structure where we feel termite problems will be minimized.</p>
<h3>Contributions and Perks:</h3>
<p>What will your support do? Your financial contributions will help offset the costs of incorporating all the systems listed above into a single prototype residence. We hope that by building one of these homes the design flaws will be determined and we can make improvements for those interested in building similar homes in the future. Perks for your generosity range from placing your initials in brick pavers on the property to DVD tours of the finished construction and ultimately receiving a set of drawings and license to build the prototype yourself. We estimate that after fees and taxes the goal amount will supplement the $425,000 we plan to contribute to building the prototype. Given preliminary estimates, we think this prototype will cost in the neighborhood of $750,000 to complete. Thank you for taking the time to read this description and for your generous support in taking this project from the drafting board to the driveway!</p>

On top of the SIPs insulation we also plan to install a metal roof to help reflect the sun’s heat in the summer and minimize the damage from weather. Solar hot water heating will minimize energy use on heating water and solar photovoltaic cells provide the first source of an expandable generating system to supplement the demand side management implementation of reduced energy usage.
To further reduce the interior climate control requirements, the house is built on an enclosed, conditioned crawl space, which also allows for easy access to the plumbing, electrical, data communication and climate control distribution systems. Added to the design are the system choices, where climate control is through a ground source heat pump with electrical backup, zoned area heat design and wood stove heating redundancy. LED lights and solar tubes will minimize energy spent on lighting, while the 70% sun light penetration will provide natural light through much of the winter day.
Rainwater harvesting will be implemented to provide water to both the toilets and local landscape irrigation and low flow water systems will minimize water use. The design also accommodates a move to gray water harvesting, if and when it is desired.
The foundation is a standard reinforced concrete with footings designed to minimize travel in all directions and a post tension slab on top of the crawlspace to prevent cracking and weakening from ground movement and earthquakes. Ties from the roof are connected through the concrete walls down to the foundation footings to prevent roof loss and increase structural integrity in high wind situations (like tornadoes), and a basement, which also provides a shelter from dangerous weather. The high strength of the prototype envelope will also help prevent damage from other weather conditions like hail, wildfires and ice storms all potential dangers in Oklahoma, where we plan to erect the prototype. We have also designed the prototype will be resistant to organic disasters, like pests. Mice and vermin should have a tough time getting into the structure where we feel termite problems will be minimized.
Contributions and Perks:
What will your support do? Your financial contributions will help offset the costs of incorporating all the systems listed above into a single prototype residence. We hope that by building one of these homes the design flaws will be determined and we can make improvements for those interested in building similar homes in the future. Perks for your generosity range from placing your initials in brick pavers on the property to DVD tours of the finished construction and ultimately receiving a set of drawings and license to build the prototype yourself. We estimate that after fees and taxes the goal amount will supplement the $425,000 we plan to contribute to building the prototype. Given preliminary estimates, we think this prototype will cost in the neighborhood of $750,000 to complete. Thank you for taking the time to read this description and for your generous support in taking this project from the drafting board to the driveway!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Then the final case will be configured with a universal female power port that the cord can be plugged into. This kind of port is the standard for many types of electronic equipment and is shown below on a power supply unit. Note: The voltage difference will be accounted for by hardware within the box, which means that if you move to a 120V country, you'll have to send your sluice in to our repair department to get some parts swapped before you can use it. We are rather certain that this is the plan and that European, Australian, Canadian, and East Asian backers will be able to use their Sluice right out of the box.SpecsPrototype Size: 12""x12""x6.4""Projected Final Size 11.25""x 6"" x 6.4""Coins Mined: Ethereum, Zclassic*, Pirl*Software: ProprietaryPower Draw: 200-250 WPower Cable: InterchangeableData Cable: USBInternet Connectivity: Wi-FiEthereum Hashrate: ~29 MH/s*these alt coins are subject to change based on profitability during the final production run, but we plan for Sluice to toggle between Ethereum and at least two other coins based on the relative profitability of each.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>THE INSPIRATION</h3>
<p>Hosting a get-together for friends and family is good fun and often these events occur spontaneously. This is when fast and effortless action is needed in order to create a setting, where everybody can comfortably sit around the same table or within the same space. Boxix is designed to enable the smooth interaction, allowing the guests and the hosts to concentrate on each other without an unnecessary hassle.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487189284/xf5khn8o5vpu5xp1zkvd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Boxix is a unique innovation, which consists of a set of six stools that are identical in height and design. When attached to each other, the cube-shaped entity gives a strong, sleek impact and also serves as an individual seat or a side table to compliment the interior decoration. This also solves the age-old problem of storing the extra chairs: with Boxix, there is no need to move or hide the additional furniture since the stools will be ready at hand when needed.</p>

</h3><p>CHK2O (check-two-oh) is a 
sensor-less water leak detection device that senses leaks anywhere 
within the home.  It can communicate and be controlled remotely using a 
smartphone (both iOS and Android) or by logging on to CHK2O's web 
portal. </p><h3><b>Why Do I Need a Water Leak Detector</b></h3><p></p><p>Dealing with cleanup and insurance claim hassles makes this 
system a bargain.  Insurance may pay for the damage, but they will never
 compensate for the time lost from work or the vacation that was planned
 for the following day.</p><p>For <b>apartment owners</b> it allows for 
complete control over of all your properties water pipes.  If there is a
 warning of possible water leak detector you can shut off the water 
before further destruction happens.  This allows time for you or  your 
renter to check for a water leak.</p><p><b>CHK2O in the media:</b></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/731652/files/20140720184924-media_pic.jpg?1405907364"" src="""" style=""""/></p>              <p></p><h3><b>Product Features</b></h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/709385/files/20140710181659-1_1_.png?1405041419"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>

provide a new approach to water leak detection in your home, office, or 
any other space where water leaks can occur.</p><p>CHK2O is a patent 
pending smart water leak detector that measures the pressure of the 
water within the home in the event of an pipe burst or appliance 
failure. Failures often range from water heaters bursting, dishwashers 
or washing machines leaking, or pipes bursting from fatigue or freezing.</p><p>CHK2O
 works by easily attaching to an existing water line and continuously 
monitoring for a change in water pressure, all without the use of 
expensive and hard-to-install remote sensors. When a change in pressure 
occurs due to failed appliances or burst / leaking pipes, CHK2O will 
stop the flow of water and signal a warning that a leak may be present.</p><p></p><h1>Smartphone App:</h1><p>A message will be relayed through a mobile app installed on a 
smartphone or via the web portal. The mobile app and website interface 
allows 24/7 access to the device and provides remote turn on / shut off 
of the water, which saves time and money. CHK2O prevents the hassles of 
clean up with little to no damage, while also providing piece of mind. 
CHK2O will eliminate the chances of having costly repairs to a 
water-damaged home and truly takes the worry out of water leaks.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/709389/files/20140710181956-CHK2opic.jpg?1405041596"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><a href=""http://www.chk2o.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><p><a href=""http://www.chk2o.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">

<b>How CHK2O Works</b>
</h1>
<h1>
<b></b> </h1>
<p><b>Prototype Testing</b></p>
<p>
To date our team has collected data in order to map normal home water 
usage. CHK2O can collect and use this data to determine the difference 
between a leak and just turning on your water.  We currently have a 
working prototype being tested in multiple homes.  This provides 
confidence when we ship product to our customers.</p>
<p>
By using a special calculation of your home's water pressure CHK2O can 
detect leaks.  When you first install CHK2O detector to your pipes you 
will need to allow for a calibration window before you can detect leaks.
  CHK2O will learn your water home behavior and overtime become more and
 more precise about how your water system is operating.  It will perform
 either manual or auto calibration checks so it always has the latest 
information on water pressure, as well as ensuring the shut off valve 
will not fail.  You will have complete control to operate all functions 
via app or website.

are included with the order.  As always, if in doubt, seek professional 
assistance.</p>
<p><b>7) Can the system be deactivated so that if I'm filling my swimming pool or watering the garden, it won't shut off?</b></p>
<p>Yes. 
 CHK2O can be placed into ""Ignore"" mode so that the system will not shut
 the water off.  After a period of time, the system will remind you that
 it is in Ignore mode, and ask if you would like to continue to ignore. 
 If you do not confirm, the system will automatically return to 
monitoring the home's water line.</p>

CHK2O (check-two-oh) is a 
sensor-less water leak detection device that senses leaks anywhere 
within the home.  It can communicate and be controlled remotely using a 
smartphone (both iOS and Android) or by logging on to CHK2O's web 
portal. Why Do I Need a Water Leak DetectorDealing with cleanup and insurance claim hassles makes this 
system a bargain.  Insurance may pay for the damage, but they will never
 compensate for the time lost from work or the vacation that was planned
 for the following day.For apartment owners it allows for 
complete control over of all your properties water pipes.  If there is a
 warning of possible water leak detector you can shut off the water 
before further destruction happens.  This allows time for you or  your 
renter to check for a water leak.CHK2O in the media:              Product Features
Easy to Install:Why CHK2O?CHK2O (pronounced check-two-oh) was developed in order to 
provide a new approach to water leak detection in your home, office, or 
any other space where water leaks can occur.CHK2O is a patent 
pending smart water leak detector that measures the pressure of the 
water within the home in the event of an pipe burst or appliance 
failure. Failures often range from water heaters bursting, dishwashers 
or washing machines leaking, or pipes bursting from fatigue or freezing.CHK2O
 works by easily attaching to an existing water line and continuously 
monitoring for a change in water pressure, all without the use of 
expensive and hard-to-install remote sensors. When a change in pressure 
occurs due to failed appliances or burst / leaking pipes, CHK2O will 
stop the flow of water and signal a warning that a leak may be present.Smartphone App:A message will be relayed through a mobile app installed on a 
smartphone or via the web portal. The mobile app and website interface 
allows 24/7 access to the device and provides remote turn on / shut off 
of the water, which saves time and money. CHK2O prevents the hassles of 
clean up with little to no damage, while also providing piece of mind. 
CHK2O will eliminate the chances of having costly repairs to a 
water-damaged home and truly takes the worry out of water leaks.

How CHK2O Works


 
Prototype Testing

To date our team has collected data in order to map normal home water 
usage. CHK2O can collect and use this data to determine the difference 
between a leak and just turning on your water.  We currently have a 
working prototype being tested in multiple homes.  This provides 
confidence when we ship product to our customers.

By using a special calculation of your home's water pressure CHK2O can 
detect leaks.  When you first install CHK2O detector to your pipes you 
will need to allow for a calibration window before you can detect leaks.
  CHK2O will learn your water home behavior and overtime become more and
 more precise about how your water system is operating.  It will perform
 either manual or auto calibration checks so it always has the latest 
information on water pressure, as well as ensuring the shut off valve 
will not fail.  You will have complete control to operate all functions 
via app or website.

</h3><p>GOBI is not just about another solar charger.  It is much more.  Here’s how we see it:</p>
<ul>
<li> It is the only device that uses 3DPV design – a design concept proven to be effective by MIT. </li>
<li> It is the first solar charger that is an integrated design with multiple tools and not just a bunch of solar cells.  </li>
<li> GOBI is about you.  It is about people.  We seriously want GOBI to launch in a big way because we see it as that ‘go to’ tool, or device, that people will just want if not need.  Whether a camper in Yosemite, a mom and her kids during a power outage in Atlanta or a student without access to main power in Africa trying to study at night - GOBI just helps fill the void of not having power and does so anywhere in the world – anyone can use it.  </li>
<li> GOBI is only the start.  The great Indiegogo folks want us to speak about ‘impact’.  The impact of gaining your support now cannot be understated.  Sure, your support helps with this project.  But, it also helps continue our work.  GOBI is patent pending but Scuint has a number of other ideas and other patents pending and your support today helps move us from empowering people, with only GOBI, to empowering them in new and novel ways.  </li>

</p><p>Scuint is proud to state it began its work three years ago and before the 3DPV concept was more widely recognized.  In many ways, Scuint is the first mover in 3DPV but Scuint is also fortunate to be able to state its early work is validated by MIT who conducted its research independently from any affiliation with Scuint but also in parallel to Scuint’s efforts.  </p><p><br/></p>

</p><h1><b>the Work Ahead</b></h1>
<p>What You Get – We hope you get any of the Perks (but secretly really hope you get GOBI).  Getting GOBI is really getting personal empowerment – the device is built to be rugged and provide for recharging smartphones to lighting the way with both a flashlight and lantern components.  If you choose another Perk, you will be assured of delivery and a high quality item - whether sticker or T-Shirt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What We Need – Your support.  With your support Scuint can employ the people and teams necessary to improve the GOBI prototype to a well-crafted product you can count on and that you’ll be proud to show your friends – and we assure you - your friends have not seen anything like GOBI before.</p>
<p>Your support is needed to gain the funds for this project and that will be used to improve, fabricate and deliver GOBI.  The projected use of funds is shown below in the following chart.  Use of funds include things that may not be readily obvious such as packaging, shipping and tax (yes, tax, apparently Uncle Sam likes crowd funding too!).</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/670645/files/20140623214427-CHART1.jpg?1403585067"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p>The ""Remainder"" amounts are the estimated amounts used prior to fulfillment of the Perks and in order to create the high quality product.  These funds will cover items such as CAD services that are needed in order to generate the files used by a 3D printer that can then create the individual parts or molds used to create the final product delivered to you (see ""the How"" for more insights).<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/670647/files/20140623214457-Chart2.jpg?1403585097"" src="""" style=""width: 588px; height: 357px;""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>While the above charts explains how the funds from this Campaign will be used.  The below Scope, Risk &amp; Challenges section explains in more detail the work to be completed and the issues associated to successfully completing the work.  This is followed by the Who section and explaining the team.</p>
<p>
</p><br/><p>
</p><h1><b>the How <br/></b></h1><h3><b>(Scope, Risks &amp; Challenges)</b></h3>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">SCOPE</span>.  Each element of the GOBI design has been tested and validated.  However, all the work to date has been just prototyping - this means relatively quick iterations of design elements molded, shaped and formed more by hand - like an artist - than a true machined approached resulting in that finer product we all know.  The work ahead for GOBI is to move from the really cool prototype to the way cooler true professional product.  This is where the funding from this Campaign gets used.  The funds gets used to develop highly accurate, 3D-printed, components and molds as well as to finalized the printed circuit boards (there are three of them in each GOBI).  Within this work are identified opportunities to further improve GOBI - these opportunities are explained below.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">CHALLENGES</span>.  The challenges ahead are limited. Given the GOBI has been iterated through multiple prototypes, we know it can be built. The remaining challenges are limited to areas of specific detail and exact functionality. We have identified the following key challenges: 1.) final printed circuit board design and charge controller/charge booster circuitry; 2.) final design of RUGD units; 3.) waterproofing the GOBI and RUGD units; 4.) small scale versus larger scale production.</p>
<p>Please see the below ""Risks"" section for more discussion on Challenge #4. For Challenges 1-3 the solution for these challenges is known - the circuitry for various power controllers is already known, selecting the best one for production is the current challenge. Similarly, the RUGD designs are known and tested. The option to include additional user friendly features to the RUGD units is the current challenge. Because the GOBI is made to float, we seek to move it from being weatherproof to waterproof - this is a big challenge and not assured. The method to achieve true waterproofing is evident but the integration of the solution into current design parameters is unknown. Currently, the GOBI should be considered weatherproof and water resistant but not truly waterproof. Please watch for updates during the project on this particular challenge.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">RISKS</span>.  As with any project, there are some risks. We have acted to identify the risks and mitigate them where possible - primarily schedule and quality risks. To date, in addition to making a number of functional prototypes, we have engaged a prototyping team and are working with a contract manufacturer to better understand how to make the GOBI as a massed produced device. Like above, the question ahead is not ""if"" it can be done but ""how"", or ""how best"", to get it done. Further, all the components have an assured supply chain. So, we have a high degree of confidence that units can be delivered. The remaining risk is really one of schedule. Can we deliver on time? That is a true unknown and an unknown partly due to the final design elements to be worked out and the quantity of units to make for this project. </p>
<p>To set expectations, at the end of the funding period, we are allowing for a 30 day design window followed by a two week design/build iteration. Likely, we can move faster than this. But, if we cannot, then on Day 45 after funding, we anticipate the first units start manufacture and are subsequently tested and shipped. Due to the manufacturing process, we also believe the manufacturer will have a number of weeks for processing and allowing first units to ship approximately 60 days after funding. All units will be fulfilled as quickly as possible thereafter. Pending the total count of units to be built, this phase could take a number of weeks. Reasonably, we believe all units can be shipped within the first 90 days after funding. It could take more time but we do not believe it should take much more than this time frame.  Other Perks will be fulfilled sooner.</p>
<p>
</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Our commitment is to build a solid product and to build a community.  This means we also seek to be transparent and will provide timely updates through the whole fulfillment cycle.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Why did you name it GOBI?</b></p>
<p>We considered naming our first product after the Gobi Desert to underscore its solar charging capability and thinking that any desert conceptually represents the power of the sun.  We soon realized the name “GOBI” could also be “go be” and that was a perfect fit for what we wanted - a personal and portable power device that empowers its owner to go be them!</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Does the flashlight come in different colors such as a red light?</b></p><p>Not yet.  For this campaign and initial product launch, we plan to provide the white light flashlight.  It is a blue/white with a focused beam and very effective - especially for its small size.  Moving forward, we do expect to offer a red light version of the same product and are researching how to provide color lenses that can be contained within the body of GOBI.  </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>How effective are the flashlight and lantern?</b></p>
<p>We think highly effective. The flashlight has a concentrated beam and can clearly illuminate objects from 50 feet away.  The lantern emits 10 lumens of warm, yellow/white, light and that can easily light up the interior of a tent or a small room.  Having both together in GOBI allows you the best of both worlds - especially in case of an emergency.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Why NiMH batteries?</b></p>
<p>It seems like the whole world has turned to Lithium Ion batteries for its portable and recharging needs.  However, to us, NiMH batteries offer a better environmental and technical solution for GOBI.  First, NiMH batteries contain no toxic ingredient and we think that is just better for the planet (and all those that inhabit it).  Second, NiMH batteries also have a higher energy capacity as compared to Lithium Ion batteries allowing for a longer use of power and can be charged hundreds of times.  They are also readily available at nearly all major retail stores.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>How can GOBI float?</b></p>
<p>Each flat section of GOBI is made like a sandwich with different types of urethane materials used for each layer.  The outer layer is a harder and more rigid material where the inner layers are made from a low density, hydrophobic, urethane that provides a light weight, but strong, solution that carries the weight of all the other GOBI components including the batteries.  Please note, the RUGD units are also design to be lightweight and we can state the flashlight unit does float and the lantern unit almost floats (we are still working on this but GOBI, with all components, still floats).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>Why did you name the company Scuint?</b></p>
<p>Because there are a large number of companies providing some form of photovoltaic or solar-thermal solution and each seems to be named “solar something” or “helio that” and we seek to take a different path and provide unique and new solutions.  So, what happens when you stare at the sun?  You squint your eyes.  The term “squint” is also slang for “smart” or “intelligent” and that’s what we want to do - provide smart and intelligent solutions.</p><br/></div>","As Reported Inthe What

The ""Remainder"" amounts are the estimated amounts used prior to fulfillment of the Perks and in order to create the high quality product.  These funds will cover items such as CAD services that are needed in order to generate the files used by a 3D printer that can then create the individual parts or molds used to create the final product delivered to you (see ""the How"" for more insights).
While the above charts explains how the funds from this Campaign will be used.  The below Scope, Risk & Challenges section explains in more detail the work to be completed and the issues associated to successfully completing the work.  This is followed by the Who section and explaining the team.


the How (Scope, Risks & Challenges)

SCOPE.  Each element of the GOBI design has been tested and validated.  However, all the work to date has been just prototyping - this means relatively quick iterations of design elements molded, shaped and formed more by hand - like an artist - than a true machined approached resulting in that finer product we all know.  The work ahead for GOBI is to move from the really cool prototype to the way cooler true professional product.  This is where the funding from this Campaign gets used.  The funds gets used to develop highly accurate, 3D-printed, components and molds as well as to finalized the printed circuit boards (there are three of them in each GOBI).  Within this work are identified opportunities to further improve GOBI - these opportunities are explained below.

CHALLENGES.  The challenges ahead are limited. Given the GOBI has been iterated through multiple prototypes, we know it can be built. The remaining challenges are limited to areas of specific detail and exact functionality. We have identified the following key challenges: 1.) final printed circuit board design and charge controller/charge booster circuitry; 2.) final design of RUGD units; 3.) waterproofing the GOBI and RUGD units; 4.) small scale versus larger scale production.
Please see the below ""Risks"" section for more discussion on Challenge #4. For Challenges 1-3 the solution for these challenges is known - the circuitry for various power controllers is already known, selecting the best one for production is the current challenge. Similarly, the RUGD designs are known and tested. The option to include additional user friendly features to the RUGD units is the current challenge. Because the GOBI is made to float, we seek to move it from being weatherproof to waterproof - this is a big challenge and not assured. The method to achieve true waterproofing is evident but the integration of the solution into current design parameters is unknown. Currently, the GOBI should be considered weatherproof and water resistant but not truly waterproof. Please watch for updates during the project on this particular challenge.

RISKS.  As with any project, there are some risks. We have acted to identify the risks and mitigate them where possible - primarily schedule and quality risks. To date, in addition to making a number of functional prototypes, we have engaged a prototyping team and are working with a contract manufacturer to better understand how to make the GOBI as a massed produced device. Like above, the question ahead is not ""if"" it can be done but ""how"", or ""how best"", to get it done. Further, all the components have an assured supply chain. So, we have a high degree of confidence that units can be delivered. The remaining risk is really one of schedule. Can we deliver on time? That is a true unknown and an unknown partly due to the final design elements to be worked out and the quantity of units to make for this project. 
To set expectations, at the end of the funding period, we are allowing for a 30 day design window followed by a two week design/build iteration. Likely, we can move faster than this. But, if we cannot, then on Day 45 after funding, we anticipate the first units start manufacture and are subsequently tested and shipped. Due to the manufacturing process, we also believe the manufacturer will have a number of weeks for processing and allowing first units to ship approximately 60 days after funding. All units will be fulfilled as quickly as possible thereafter. Pending the total count of units to be built, this phase could take a number of weeks. Reasonably, we believe all units can be shipped within the first 90 days after funding. It could take more time but we do not believe it should take much more than this time frame.  Other Perks will be fulfilled sooner.

Our commitment is to build a solid product and to build a community.  This means we also seek to be transparent and will provide timely updates through the whole fulfillment cycle.

GOBI Teaser Videothe PerksNow that you have learned about GOBI and have seen the Perks, there are a couple of things to point out for certain Perks.  Below are the images we plan to use for the GOBI Sticker and the GOBI T-Shirt.  GOBI Sticker (Measures 4"" x 6"")GOBI T-Shirt-Founder EditionThis image will fill the back of your Founder T-Shirt.  T-Shirts are 100%, white, high quality cotton short sleeve tees.  The basic GOBI T-Shirt has the same image without the ""Funder/Founder"" and without the ""I Made It Happen"" taglines. the FAQsBelow please find the listing of most commonly asked questions and their answers.  We seek to be transparent so please send more questions.


Why did you name it GOBI?
We considered naming our first product after the Gobi Desert to underscore its solar charging capability and thinking that any desert conceptually represents the power of the sun.  We soon realized the name “GOBI” could also be “go be” and that was a perfect fit for what we wanted - a personal and portable power device that empowers its owner to go be them!

Does the flashlight come in different colors such as a red light?Not yet.  For this campaign and initial product launch, we plan to provide the white light flashlight.  It is a blue/white with a focused beam and very effective - especially for its small size.  Moving forward, we do expect to offer a red light version of the same product and are researching how to provide color lenses that can be contained within the body of GOBI.  

How effective are the flashlight and lantern?
We think highly effective. The flashlight has a concentrated beam and can clearly illuminate objects from 50 feet away.  The lantern emits 10 lumens of warm, yellow/white, light and that can easily light up the interior of a tent or a small room.  Having both together in GOBI allows you the best of both worlds - especially in case of an emergency.

Why NiMH batteries?
It seems like the whole world has turned to Lithium Ion batteries for its portable and recharging needs.  However, to us, NiMH batteries offer a better environmental and technical solution for GOBI.  First, NiMH batteries contain no toxic ingredient and we think that is just better for the planet (and all those that inhabit it).  Second, NiMH batteries also have a higher energy capacity as compared to Lithium Ion batteries allowing for a longer use of power and can be charged hundreds of times.  They are also readily available at nearly all major retail stores.

How can GOBI float?
Each flat section of GOBI is made like a sandwich with different types of urethane materials used for each layer.  The outer layer is a harder and more rigid material where the inner layers are made from a low density, hydrophobic, urethane that provides a light weight, but strong, solution that carries the weight of all the other GOBI components including the batteries.  Please note, the RUGD units are also design to be lightweight and we can state the flashlight unit does float and the lantern unit almost floats (we are still working on this but GOBI, with all components, still floats).



Why did you name the company Scuint?
Because there are a large number of companies providing some form of photovoltaic or solar-thermal solution and each seems to be named “solar something” or “helio that” and we seek to take a different path and provide unique and new solutions.  So, what happens when you stare at the sun?  You squint your eyes.  The term “squint” is also slang for “smart” or “intelligent” and that’s what we want to do - provide smart and intelligent solutions.",6.0,3,"2 Campaigns

<p>Behind Authometion there is a group of people passionate
about new technologies, open source platforms, and most of all about the
Internet of Things!</p>
<p>The vision that we have is a world where Home Automation
is accessible and affordable to everyone, where there is no need for any wired
and expensive controlling devices, nor complex installation from technicians. And
where <b><i>YOU </i></b> will be able to manage your smart home systems from any smartphone, tablet,
or laptop.</p>
<p><b><i>Whenever you want, wherever you are.</i></b></p>
<p>A future where your home, your smart home,
will be equipped with state-of-the-art technology that will enable any
household not only to remotely control lighting, HVAC (heating, ventilation and
air conditioning), kitchen appliances, and security systems, but to actually
“automate” any actions when triggered by specific events and scenarios.</p>
<p><i><b>The end goal that we envisage is to improve convenience,
comfort, energy efficiency, and security in your most important place. Your
home.</b></i></p>
<p>This is why we have founded Authometion and developed
IoTuino, a WiFi core module to be embedded in any object and enable the
Internet of Things revolution. But this is just our starting point...</p>
<p>In fact, since one of the most sought-after
applications in Home Automation is lighting control, we have decided to start from here
and develop LYT, a smart led bulb completely controllable by IoTuino. This is
the first time ever that you can enjoy such bundling.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we have decided to work in an open-source environment to offer the best development platform to the makers
community.</p><p></p><br/><p><b></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Pietro Moscetta</b> is a tech-savvy

What is IoTuino?

IoTuino is a 56x23 mm core module, compatible with Arduino UNO, for Internet of Things (IoT).
It is based on an ATMega328P microcontroller, a miniaturized low power Wi-Fi module (IEEE802.1 1b/g/n), a 512Kb SPI Flash, a proprietary 2.4Ghz radio transceiver used to manage our LYT led bulbs, and an integrated mini USB programming port.                    What does IoTuino do?
IoTuino
enables any object to connect to the internet and interact with the
real world thanks to the open-source Arduino development
platform. For
this reason IoTuino is the perfect partner for Home Automation
applications.
Turn
any home into a smart home.!
...
but there is one more thing! IoTuino
is the first and only development board that smoothly incorporates a
native control over smart led bulbs!
    

IoTuino can totally control our LYT, a smart led bulb!
LYT is a 9W RGB-W radio led bulb that can be completely controlled by IoTuino with the integrated radio transceiver that we have developed: from your smartphone, tablet, or laptop you can switch on/off, change the RGB color, and change the brightness because each LYT is dimmable!!!
You can manage and control your home lightning by using our LYTs as if they were wireless sensors!
Do you want to controll many many lights in your home? No problem! With a single IoTuino you can control up to 65.000 LYT led
bulbs!
                


            


    IoTuino: Arduino-compatible WiFi core module for IoT with integrated lighting control
For the first time developers will have the possibility, using the popular Arduino environment, to control our LYT as a wireless sensor! IoTuino and LYT can already be used with IFTTT,  Zapier, and any other automation services through our free WebApp available for Windows, OSX and Linux.         Web App screenshoot. Control your LYT from any place in the world.                  IFTTT schema example with internal trigger generated by a PIR sensor.Look how simple is to control the LYT from your code!!!Do you want some technical specifications?IoTuino technical specs:

The Internet of Things
will drive us to a brand new dimension. This is a new revolutionary way of
life!
Would you like to live in
this new world, and actually lead the change?
We need your help to make
this happen.
Please support our
crowdfunding campaign so as to move forward from prototyping to mass-production
We need to confirm the
supply agreement for large batches of units, start off the assembly, and finalize
certification & homologation.
So far, we have been
working on small and expensive batches to build our prototypes for development boards and smart led bulbs, and we have succeeded to bootstrapping the
operations in order to validate our assumptions and deliver a full-fledged
working prototype, including hardware and software/firmware.
But now we need to move
to bigger batches in order to make it sustainable on a larger scale, and allow
all makers and developers around the world to get their own kit at an affordable price... And start turning
ideas into real products!
We and our suppliers are
ready and committed to deliver the best product and guarantee a rewarding user experience.Expected delivery date: within January 2015.With IoTuino and LYT in
your hands you will be able to think, build, and enjoy new features for your
smart home!

community and unlock your creativity and imagination!
Thank you very much for
your support!!!ABOUT US
Behind Authometion there is a group of people passionate
about new technologies, open source platforms, and most of all about the
Internet of Things!
The vision that we have is a world where Home Automation
is accessible and affordable to everyone, where there is no need for any wired
and expensive controlling devices, nor complex installation from technicians. And
where YOU  will be able to manage your smart home systems from any smartphone, tablet,
or laptop.
Whenever you want, wherever you are.
A future where your home, your smart home,
will be equipped with state-of-the-art technology that will enable any
household not only to remotely control lighting, HVAC (heating, ventilation and
air conditioning), kitchen appliances, and security systems, but to actually
“automate” any actions when triggered by specific events and scenarios.
The end goal that we envisage is to improve convenience,
comfort, energy efficiency, and security in your most important place. Your
home.
This is why we have founded Authometion and developed
IoTuino, a WiFi core module to be embedded in any object and enable the
Internet of Things revolution. But this is just our starting point...
In fact, since one of the most sought-after
applications in Home Automation is lighting control, we have decided to start from here
and develop LYT, a smart led bulb completely controllable by IoTuino. This is
the first time ever that you can enjoy such bundling.
Last but not least, we have decided to work in an open-source environment to offer the best development platform to the makers
community.Pietro Moscetta is a tech-savvy
geek entrepreneur holding 25 years of experience in HW, SW, and FW development
especially for remote control applications and devices. He is an expert in the
design of microcontroller systems to collect data and signals from multiple
sensors, and to process and transfer such data through any kind of wired
(RS232, RS485, RS422) and wireless (WiFi, Bluetooth, GPRS, Radio) technology. Despite
all his experience and knowledge in the tech world, his wife still wonders why he
cannot understand how a woman works!Find out more or get in touch on www.authometion.com....and if you have any questions contact us at info [at] authometion.comFAQ

</div></div>","For many of us it happens every morning, especially when running late. You are on your way out the door and your keys are nowhere to be found! It’s a frustrating situation and a bad way to start your day. But what if you could simply walk out the door? Better yet, what if you never needed those keys again? Upgrading your door with an advanced fingerprint lock can make it all possible.
 

 
Most fingerprint locks currently on the market are bulky, difficult to install, expensive and lack accuracy. That’s why we invented BrillLock. A smart fingerprint door lock with minimalist styling that is easy to install, meticulously accurate and amazingly affordable.
 

 
 

 
Say goodbye to fumbling for your keys in the doorway. BrillLock is easy to use without the need for keys.
Complement your home style with BrillLock’s simple and elegant look that matches any door style. 

 

 
Integrated with a 360° fingerprint interface, BrillLock identifies the user and unlocks the door within 0.5 seconds. 

 
With only a screwdriver, you can install BrillLock in just a few minutes. Most importantly, it costs less than most other smart locks on the market.
 

 
 

 
Your security is our priority. Equipped with an anti-theft semiconductor sensor, BrillLock has a FAR (False Acceptance Rate) rate lower than 0.001%, which means that it is virtually impossible to unlock the door with unverified biometrics. 

 
Built with the most advanced and safest level C lock cylinder, BrillLock is made to be secure, reliable and unhackable.
 

 
Hidden keyhole and fingerprint interface design adds an additional layer of security for you and your family.
 

 
 

 
Versatility and ease of use are essential. BrillLock is designed with 2 modes so you can streamline your daily activities. Enable the Lock Down Mode to securely lock the front door of your house, your dormitory, a locker, or rental home.
 

 
Conveniently switch to Smart Open Mode to keep the room doors unlocked at home, at your business or in the office.
 

 

 
 

 
 Long battery Life 
BrillLock runs on two lithium-ion batteries that last for up to 3,000 entries. When the battery power is low, the LED light will flash red to remind you to charge it.
 

 

 
Various Compatibility
BrillLock is compatible with most EU locks, North American locks and Swiss lock cylinders.
 

 
 
 All-Metal Body 
BrillLock is made with a combination of stainless steel and zinc alloy. The polished metal is secure & durable and gives the body a sleek and elegant look.
 

 

 
 L-Shaped Handle 
Fits the American safety standard.

Our new smart technology, Dew Point Intelligence™, will make creating water from the air energy-efficient. Under the right conditions, our water can cost as little as two cents (USD) a liter.</p>
<p>It will take approximately three to four months for us to build a working prototype of our new smart technology. We know this technology will work but are lacking the funds to complete it. We have put together this campaign to help raise the $200,000 we need to do this.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Benefits of Dew Point Intelligence</strong></h3>
<p>To quote <a href=""http://water.org/water-crisis/one-billion-affected/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Water.org Water Facts"">water.org</a>, <em>“Without water, life would not exist. It is a prerequisite for all human and economic development. Yet today, 780 million people – about one in nine – lack access to clean water. More than twice that many, 2.5 billion people, don’t have access to a toilet.”</em></p>
<p>We do not claim to be “the” one solution to the world’s water crisis but we know we can help <em>if</em> we are given a chance to complete our prototype.</p>
<p>By helping <strong>provide drinking water</strong> to people whose only water source is badly polluted or in scarce supply, we can help save lives. How pure is our water? Check out a water report from our ten-year-old prototype <a href=""https://plus.google.com/u/0/113606898955083100302/posts/gzYhXHRwDJx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""ATWT Water Report"">here</a>.</p>

<strong>What does Dew Point Intelligence</strong><strong> do</strong><strong>?</strong>
</h3>
<p>Atmospheric water generation varies with temperature and humidity just as solar and wind technologies vary with environmental changes. Temperatures can soar during the day lowering the humidity. And, temperatures cool off during the night causing the humidity to climb quite high. </p>
<p>So, it is necessary to carefully program and adjust the atmospheric water generator to follow the changes in temperature and humidity that create dew point. Our smart technology expands the range of atmospheric water generation (from just above freezing to about 130° F/54.44°C) that is possible without deicing via hot gas by-pass technology. </p>

<h3>
<strong>How do we calculate the energy savings from Dew Point Intelligence</strong><strong>?</strong>
</h3>
<p>When an atmospheric water generator is operating at 100°F/37.77°C and <strong>30%</strong> relative humidity, it requires 4 compressors at 100 amps /460 volts to reach a dew point of 63°F/17.22°C plus an additional 5°F (now 58°F/14.44°C) to insure proper temperature throughout the coil. Therefore <strong>42</strong><strong>°</strong><strong>F</strong> (100° – 58° = 42°) of refrigeration is needed.</p>
<p>If the same generator is operating at 100°F/37.77°C and <strong>85%</strong> relative humidity, one compressor is needed at 24 amps/460 volts to reach a dew point of at 95°F/17.22°C plus an additional 5°F (now 90°F/32.22°C) to insure proper temperature throughout the coil. Therefore only <strong>10</strong><strong>°</strong><strong>F</strong> (100°F – 90°F = 10°F) of refrigeration is needed.</p>
<p>Dew Point Intelligence has created an<strong> energy savings of 76.2% </strong>or is using 23.8% (10 divided by 42 = .238) of full power at 30% humidity.</p>

<h3>
<strong>Our Dew Point Intelligence</strong><strong> water costs explained</strong>
</h3>
<p>Water costs per gallon/liter are based on the following assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost and size of the atmospheric water generator with a ten-year amortization. We amortize for ten years even though the generator may last twenty-five years.</li>
<li>The cost of power (three phase commercial ratings only) per kWh at the unit’s location.</li>
<li>The temperature and humidity averages of the area for at least one year (hourly averages if available). High temperatures with low humidity are taken out of the formula because the atmospheric water generator is programmed to turn off and restart when humidity increases.</li>
</ul><p>Low humidity happens predominately during peak energy costs (hot dry afternoons)...which is why the analysis needs to be done by the hour. The machine is programmed to cut out costly low humidity water production. The lower the humidity at any temperature, the less water the atmospheric water generator will produce (see the water production chart above) as well as having higher power costs.</p>
<p>At 25-30% humidity the atmospheric water generator is running at full power to meet dew point requirements. But, when humidity goes up, the refrigeration can be cut back considerably and to still meet dew point requirements to condense water. The client and our engineers decide upon the unit’s humidity cut off point.</p>
<p>An excellent example of how this works is found in the report we put together for Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is an excellent location for atmospheric water generation based not only on temperature and humidity but some of the best power costs we have seen to date. Below you will find an analysis chart showing the energy costs and water production based on a unit with a limited 19-hour water production schedule. The 19 hour water production schedule was agreed upon not just because of low humidity but the schedule also coincided with off-peak energy costs of $0.04 (USD).</p>
<p>The chart below is based on more than just energy cost differences. When we examined the past year’s temperatures and humidity, we discovered that approximately 26% of the year has very high temperatures with less than 29.5% humidity. We recommend that the unit be turned off during these times of high temperatures and low humidity.</p>
<p>The chart below clearly shows how choosing your operating schedule affects the final cost of water.</p>

<h3><strong>Additional Uses for Dew Point Intelligence</strong></h3>
<p>Our pending patent is for using refrigeration to remove condensation from the air. This smart technology works well for any dehumidification need. It minimizes energy use by tightly controlling the refrigeration system and reducing unnecessary compressor usage. Higher humidity at any temperature will also lower costs and the noise level.</p>
<p>The dehumidification process will mean significant energy savings for not just atmospheric water but also controlling humidity in commercial buildings, drying out water damaged homes and buildings, and much more.</p>

Benefits of Dew Point Intelligence
To quote water.org, “Without water, life would not exist. It is a prerequisite for all human and economic development. Yet today, 780 million people – about one in nine – lack access to clean water. More than twice that many, 2.5 billion people, don’t have access to a toilet.”
We do not claim to be “the” one solution to the world’s water crisis but we know we can help if we are given a chance to complete our prototype.
By helping provide drinking water to people whose only water source is badly polluted or in scarce supply, we can help save lives. How pure is our water? Check out a water report from our ten-year-old prototype here.

Under the right conditions, our water can cost as little as two cents (USD) per liter. How much of a financial savings is this over current technology? The infographic below illustrates the savings from Dew Point Technology.

How do we calculate the energy savings from Dew Point Intelligence?

When an atmospheric water generator is operating at 100°F/37.77°C and 30% relative humidity, it requires 4 compressors at 100 amps /460 volts to reach a dew point of 63°F/17.22°C plus an additional 5°F (now 58°F/14.44°C) to insure proper temperature throughout the coil. Therefore 42°F (100° – 58° = 42°) of refrigeration is needed.
If the same generator is operating at 100°F/37.77°C and 85% relative humidity, one compressor is needed at 24 amps/460 volts to reach a dew point of at 95°F/17.22°C plus an additional 5°F (now 90°F/32.22°C) to insure proper temperature throughout the coil. Therefore only 10°F (100°F – 90°F = 10°F) of refrigeration is needed.
Dew Point Intelligence has created an energy savings of 76.2% or is using 23.8% (10 divided by 42 = .238) of full power at 30% humidity.

The cost of power (three phase commercial ratings only) per kWh at the unit’s location.
The temperature and humidity averages of the area for at least one year (hourly averages if available). High temperatures with low humidity are taken out of the formula because the atmospheric water generator is programmed to turn off and restart when humidity increases.
Low humidity happens predominately during peak energy costs (hot dry afternoons)...which is why the analysis needs to be done by the hour. The machine is programmed to cut out costly low humidity water production. The lower the humidity at any temperature, the less water the atmospheric water generator will produce (see the water production chart above) as well as having higher power costs.
At 25-30% humidity the atmospheric water generator is running at full power to meet dew point requirements. But, when humidity goes up, the refrigeration can be cut back considerably and to still meet dew point requirements to condense water. The client and our engineers decide upon the unit’s humidity cut off point.
An excellent example of how this works is found in the report we put together for Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia is an excellent location for atmospheric water generation based not only on temperature and humidity but some of the best power costs we have seen to date. Below you will find an analysis chart showing the energy costs and water production based on a unit with a limited 19-hour water production schedule. The 19 hour water production schedule was agreed upon not just because of low humidity but the schedule also coincided with off-peak energy costs of $0.04 (USD).
The chart below is based on more than just energy cost differences. When we examined the past year’s temperatures and humidity, we discovered that approximately 26% of the year has very high temperatures with less than 29.5% humidity. We recommend that the unit be turned off during these times of high temperatures and low humidity.
The chart below clearly shows how choosing your operating schedule affects the final cost of water.

  
Additional Uses for Dew Point Intelligence
Our pending patent is for using refrigeration to remove condensation from the air. This smart technology works well for any dehumidification need. It minimizes energy use by tightly controlling the refrigeration system and reducing unnecessary compressor usage. Higher humidity at any temperature will also lower costs and the noise level.
The dehumidification process will mean significant energy savings for not just atmospheric water but also controlling humidity in commercial buildings, drying out water damaged homes and buildings, and much more.
 
Our Team
In 1998 (Incorporated in 2002), we started developing air to water generators. Unlike the dot-com organizations that were prevalent at that time, we did not want to grow the business only on an idea and the sale of stock. We wanted to serve our fellow human beings throughout the world. To that end, founders Jeffrey Bagley and Dick Corso have worked to develop technology that will help as many as possible.

Jeffrey W. Bagley, Co-Founder
Jeffrey is concurrently the President of The Gold Torch, a thriving jewelry manufacturing firm that he founded almost 30 years ago in San Jose, California.  Serving both domestic and international customers, earnings for The Gold Torch have grown three-fold over the last 10 years. Jeffrey directs product design, operations and all business development activities for the company. Over the past 40 years Mr. Bagley has owned several firms in the manufacturing and retail industries, taking concepts (such as a pivoting and locking clamp) from the idea stage and shepherding them into flourishing business ventures. Jeffrey also co-invented a liquid cooling system for computers and an optical on-demand defrost system for refrigeration with his brother, Alan Bagley.
Richard “Dick” Corso, Co-Founder

With over 40 years experience in Sales, Executive Management and Business Development, Dick has owned his own business for 30 years. His sales and entrepreneurial skills have ranked him in the top 1% of people in each of the three industries that he has been involved.  In his early sales career, he was a top producer in three different companies each of which had sales representatives in the thousands. Since founding Midwest LMI (Leadership Management Inc.) over 30 years ago, he has worked with start-up companies, Fortune 100 companies and the range of sizes in between. Some of his more noted clients are General Electric, Allstate, Sears, Abbott Labs, AT&T, The U.S. Postal Service, General Motors as well as other Governmental Agencies and Utility Companies and many more. Dick has personally been involved with the motivation training of several Olympic figure skaters. Dick has served on numerous Boards of Directors for both charitable and for-profit organizations. Some of the Boards that he served are The Boy Scouts of America, Cancer Treatment Research Foundation, International Organization of Women Executives and many more. He has also taught Management and Marketing classes at several Colleges and Universities such as Harper College and The University of Northeastern Illinois. 
Alan Bagley, Co-Founder
As an electrical and mechanical engineer, Alan was responsible for the introduction and design of Air to Water Technologies' atmospheric water generators. He was a valued advisor until he passed away in 2012.
Keith Lucia, Chief Refrigeration Guru
Keith has over 30 years of experience in the refrigeration industry. He has worked on refrigeration applications for both supermarkets and industrial projects. 
Alan Heinzen, Strategic Partner (Heinzen Manufacturing)
As company founder of Heinzen Manufacturing International, Alan has been at the leading edge of technical innovation in the fresh-cut industry for more than 30 years. His engineering experience and manufacturing background have enabled him to focus on designing quality equipment and processing lines with emphasis on production, maintenance and food safety issues. Alan has managed all facets of the design, production and installation of processing plants from the ground up, from value-added broccoli plants to complete lettuce processing lines. His experience includes working with customers such as Mann Packing, Gilroy Foods, Christopher Ranch, D’Arrigo Bros., Dixie Produce & Packaging, Fresh Express and Tanimura & Antle. Alan received his Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.
Gregory Smith, Patent Attorney
Gregory has over 18 years of experience providing patent preparation and prosecution services in technical areas including but not limited to nanotechnology, medical devices, mechanical arts, chemistry, data storage technologies, biotechnology, agricultural technologies, integrated circuit devices, and manufacturing processes. Additional expertise includes over 16 years experience providing strategic guidance to companies and inventors in the areas of patents, trademarks, joint development agreements, and technology licensing.

<h3>HELPING TO SAVE LIVES, PROPERTY, and PEACE OF MIND</h3>
<p>Burglaries are scary and unpredictable. Gaining access into your home is not as hard as you might think. One frequently used technique is Key-Bumping.  Key-Bumping is a lock picking technique that uses a specially made key called a Bump Key, that can easily be purchased online. When the key is inserted, it is struck, causing the pins inside the lock cylinder to quickly move and allow the intruder entry with little to no damage to the lock or door. Unfortunately most people only look for a solution after a situation occurs. </p>

And 85% of this energy is generated using fossil fuels still to date. The situation isn’t much better in the US and Canada either: in 2016, 17 metric tons of CO2 was released into the atmosphere in the US - per person!Our heating habits relying on this outdated technology are the main cause of smog in most cities.Let’s free the world from unnecessary CO2 emission caused by outdated and wasteful heating technologies!Instead of heating the whole house unnecessarily, create microclimates that focus the heat to smaller spots in the apartment. With this you can already lower your house’s energy consumption by 33% - 40%.In addition, with POIZO’s directional heat technology and smart control you can even double the savings. Sounds fair to your pocket and to your planet, right?MULTI-ZONE PERSONALIZED HEATINGOur patent-pending Directional Heat technology provides multi-zone heat projection, allowing users to simultaneously personalize their thermal comfort according to their own unique needs. This means that everyone in the same room can enjoy their own level of comfort at the same time, resulting in better moods and happier coexistence. Also, Poizo prevents energy waste by selectively targeting and heating the areas that need it.SAFE. AND NO SOUND.Besides personal thermal comfort Poizo gives you another kind of comfort by being ultimately safe to use.A 3D sensor constantly monitors the position of the device, and if it senses anything strange (for eg. the appliance tips over) the heating automatically switches off. Poizo automatically lowers the temperature if an unhealthy or dangerous setting is chosen or if it gets overheated. In case of a software disfunction, it switches off completely. As the heating happens through projection, Poizo doesn’t have any fans. No fans mean no noise at all. Sounds great, right?IT’S SMART. AND GETS SMARTER.Poizo is equipped with machine learning technology that learns each user’s personal comfort and sets heating power accordingly. Through continuously monitoring the changes in the environment, Poizo is able to fine-tune the projected heat to flawlessly ensure each user’s personal preference. In addition, the heater’s smart functions are easily controlled via the Poizo mobile app, meaning all the six zones can be simultaneously adjusted by six users and their six smartphones. Let’s just admit: six is the new sexy!Remember the time when you and your significant other had the first fight over the thermostat settings? Yeah… we all do. In almost every household where more than one person lives, arguments happen from time to time regarding personal comfort. One of you is feeling either hot or cold - losing control over their own thermal comfort...The reason behind this unease is the way we heat our rooms: ​the most widespread method is called convectional heating: it first heats the air which then will heat our bodies. However, the hot air inside the room will first rise to the ceiling and then return to us much cooler. In essence we first heat the ceiling followed by the whole volume of air in the room before we’d be able to feel some warmth. To make matters worse, we usually heat the room to the level where nobody feels cold, but to achieve this we overheat the air and not only in the room where we are at, but in the whole house! This results in increased energy consumption which in turn increases the greenhouse gas emissions: the #1 reason of polar bears starving to death. Your local heating is pretty much a global problem.Comfortable and healthy heatingInfrared waves represent a safe and healthy way to heat - and guess what: it’s the same method our good old Sun uses to heat our planet. As it has been around all time, ever since the first life forms appeared on Earth, no wonder we find the warmth provided by sun rays the most pleasurable. Rest assured, infrared waves have nothing to do with burning your skin, they only provide heat - but no risky tan at all.
Traditional heating methods which completely warm up the air in the room, can cause a big drop in air humidity, resulting in constant dry air indoors(below 40% humidity) during the cold season. Low humidity can cause dry skin, irritate nasal passages and throat, and make the eyes itchy. Poizo’s infrared heating method does not dry the air in volumes, which results in a more optimal and natural air humidity indoors with no irritations or other symptoms.
Poizo’s Directional Heat Technology makes it possible to aim the infrared waves to the exact direction where they are needed.
Poizo provides Multi-Zone Heating with 6 individually controllable heating zones at the same time, allowing each user to set up different heating temperatures simultaneously.
Safe heating
​​It’s common knowledge that most house fires are caused by portable heaters which easily overheat or flip over. Poizo’s infrared technology has allowed us to significantly decrease the surface temperature needed for providing heat. 
The device also has 3D sensors built in which immediately recognize if the heater is about to flip over. The sensors cut the power instantly to make an accident even less likely. 
Poizo continuously analyzes the temperatures around the device and if for any reason it rises over a range (i.e. the device gets covered with a cloth), the heating power will be lowered.
Smart heating
​​Besides controlling Poizo on the device itself, you can - of course - control it with your smartphone using Bluetooth. 
Using the Poizo app each user can create their Personal Comfort Profile allowing the device to learn their individual settings and to use this knowledge to intuitively adjust to their exact thermal needs.
 The Poizo smart device with its many sensors and the related smartphone app create a true, ever-evolving comfort ecosystem. 
​​By using Poizo, it constantly learns about your behaviour and usage patterns in order to make you feel warm and cozy any time while using the least amount of energy possible. 
Your Personal Comfort Profile is not locked to one device or place. This means wherever you go, be it your office or a hotel thousands of miles away, if there is a POIZO device, it will immediately know what temperature and comfort you prefer.
No more quarrels: six different users can simultaneously log into one device and set their preferred heating power to the selected zones.
​​The smartphone app also acts like an analytics tool where you can see the power consumption in real time along with information about inside and outside temperature and humidity levels. You can set notifications in case you exceed a certain threshold of energy usage to be able to act accordingly. You’ll also receive notification when you get home on a cold winter evening in order to be able to turn on the heating instantly. Also, you can set up an automatic turn off sequence after you leave the area of the device and a certain number of minutes have passed - so it won’t simply turn off when you accidently move out of the zone while at home. We've used an iterative design process from the very early stages by constantly talking to potential users and refining our design and user experience.Finding the right material is not an easy task.

<p></p></div>","People get into emergency situations but they may not have the time or possibility to call for help using their cell phones. So we wanna introduce bembu to you. bembu stands for “bluetooth emergency button” and allows you to call for help with the push of a button!
Key functionalities
* The experts-mode detects up to 4 clicks and many more actions can be configured freely!

1. More safety for you and your loved ones!
Particularly women are often victims of violence and get traumatized, insecure and scared, especially when they are out alone at night or during the dark. bembu gives you safety and selfconfidence back though you have the possibility to call for help at any time.Also parents no longer have to worry about their kids, because they have the possiblity to inform mum and dad in any situation.Older or handicaped people have now a stylish alternative to the bulky, ugly solutions on the market.
In case of an emergency situation, bembu can send a message to multiple pre-defined recipients and guarantee the best help by providing your exact position. In this way bembu can inform your family or friends, the rescue services and the police, but also may deter the attacker through an acoustic sound signal, that help is already on the way. bembu is the perfect companion for you and everyone you care about! ... but bembu is a lot more!





2. Your daily smart help!
To make bembu a day to day available companion we added a really cool feature that will help you through your rough day - 1 click and your smartphone catches your attention if you have lost it - THE PHONEFINDER!In addition bembu has a lot of great passive features too!bembu is free of electrical smog, it is waterproove, the battery lasts for 6 months ...For all who want more, there is the experts-mode, which allows you to freely configure many more functions! 





 

How does it work

The
functional principle of bembu is as smart as brilliant!
For installation you just need a Smartphone and the bembu-bracelet. You install the free bembu-APP and pair the devices once via Bluetooth. thats it!When you press your bembu once, the PHONEFINDER will be activcated.When you double-press bembu it gets you HELP whenever you need it!All the functions can be comfortably configured in the APP.The
application and bluetooth connection are only activated if the bembu-button is
pressed, therefore, it does not drain your battery. The application recognizes
the specific input and preforms the desired action.bembu supports all common bluetooth-standards and almost every smartphone - so bembu will work even on older smartphones as well as on new ones.
To make bembu a reliable emergency notification system, we only use high quality components and materials, as well as we implemented various strategies to send the emergency notifications as quick and as reliable as possible. We provide best european engineering quality!
Stylish and wearable

We know that style and function are equally important. People, especially women, don’t wear big and bulky tech devices. In fact, they don’t wear “devices”, they wear jewelry. So we set out to create a bracelet that is both ... stylish AND functional.

<p><strong>BamBols – Reusable Bamboo Mesh Produce Bags to keep produce fresh longer</strong></p>
<p>Reusable Mesh Produce Bags made of viscose from bamboo - reusable, strong, sustainable and help you avoid single use plastic.</p>

<p><strong>A bag that keeps your fruits &amp; vegetables fresh and does not end up in a landfill!</strong></p>
<p>An average American family takes home 29 plastic bags every week in some form. We felt guilty continuing this practice and looked for an effective eco-friendly solution. Unable to find a durable high-quality produce bag, we decided to create Bambols. Bambols offers an effective solution to transport and store your produce. </p>
<p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
<p>Mesh Structure: stretchable, easy identification of contents</p>
<p>Reusable: can be washed and reused many times</p>
<p>Strong: can carry 20 pounds (9 kg) per bag</p>
<p>Breathable: great air circulation keeps produce fresh longer</p>
<p>Tare weight on tag so the cashier can reduce it from the produce weight</p>
<p>Sustainable: Bamboo farm yields 10x more than cotton and grows up to 3 feet/day</p>
<p>Keeps produce fresh and saves space</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589216188/ltk9ywu4ghgjqksgwqe1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Bonus: </strong>Bamboo crops absorb 5x the amount of greenhouse gases and produce 35% more oxygen than an equivalent stand of trees!                      </p>
<p>BamBols come in two sizes – Medium and Large. We wanted to keep it simple with just two sizes to reduce your decision fatigue as there is one less choice to make about the right bag size and also help us keep our costs down with fewer skews and inventory.</p>
<p><strong>2 sizes to suit your shopping needs</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589216228/tmgxaui1xigmoou5uzdm.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>In addition to produce shopping, these multipurpose bags can be used as home organizers, laundry bags for delicates, travel storage organizer bags, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Durability Testing:</strong></p>
<p>We have been testing our prototypes over the past year to iterate and improve our design. We selected a doubling yarn structure, smaller mesh hole size and covered inseam design that would increase the strength of our bag so that it can carry heavy loads, be washed and reused many times. </p>
<p>Bambols can carry 20 pounds (9 kg approx) each without losing stretch</p>

<p><strong>Recycling Sustainability program:</strong></p>
<p>Finally, when it comes time to replace Bambols (after many many uses), we offer a recycle program if you are unable to properly dispose. Ship us back the bags so we can recycle and in exchange, we will offer you a discount on your next purchase. This way, you will be part of our sustainable community for a lifetime and ensure that any products you purchase from us is not left behind on our planet.</p>

<p>Static Energy™is the consumer’s solution to the long and short-term effects of most energy drinks. Unlike other energy drinks, this beverage seeks to give the end user the energy needed without the horrendous aftertaste, jitters, or crash. This energy drink has one Goal and its to help you reach YOURS! You want a boost of energy; you get a boost of energy!</p>
<p><strong>Static Energy™Drink: The solution</strong></p>
<p>What do you do when all the products available in your local stores, which claim to give you an energy boost, simply makes you jittery and also makes your heart feel as if its going to pulsate out of your chest? What do you do after you get a quick boost of energy, but once you lose your wings, the crash is not worth the initial boost you felt? The answer is quite simple, look for a new source. You seek out a new source that is able to provide you the energy you need to put in those extra hours in the studio or at work, more effort in the gym, or to just simply stay awake after a long day without the additional placebo effects.</p>
<p>As typical workaholics who get less than 5 hours of sleep on average each night, it was imperative for the Static Energy™ Drink Group to develop the perfect formula for a beverage that would provide added alertness and focus while stimulating the mind.</p>
<p><strong>What is the goal of Static Energy™ Group?</strong></p>
<p>The goal of Static Energy™ is to bring a fresh taste into the energy drink market with the intent of using natural sweeteners in the formulation process. We aim to have a product that is among one of the few energy drinks made with natural sweeteners while accommodating the customers need to find what they are consuming enjoyable. The main foci in the formulation of this drink are to be without side effects as well as being an enjoyable refreshment.</p>
<p><strong>Why//How/When is indiegogo?</strong><br/>Why - indiegogo gives people like us, with unique and specific dreams, a chance to make them come to life with help from supporters like you.<br/>When - Now. We have just 60 days to raise $20,000.</p>
<p><strong>How will your money be used?</strong></p>
<p>With your support, funds will help bring Static Energy™ to life by allowing us to hire the top professionals in the beverage industry known as <strong>PowerBrands</strong>(developed <em>Gatorade, Pepsi, Sierra Mist, Mountain Dew, rapper 50 cents new energy shot: Street Kings Energy and more</em>) to Research &amp; Develop our beverage, Packaging: which is the shape and design of the can itself, Label Design: meaning our logo could possibly change for the better, Product Formulation, and last but not least, Produce prototypes to generate interest and awareness prior to manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong>How Do I Help?</strong></p>
<p>If you've never used indiegogo before, here is the scoop. We need help getting our project off the ground, so we reach out to people like yourselves that may share a similar interest in makin Static Energy™ come to life so you have a new and effective energy drink to enjoy. <br/>We have 60 days to reach our goal. If we don't reach it the money that was pledged will be refunded to your account.. If we do reach it, we get to keep it and make Static Energy™yours and our reality. If we go beyond it we are going to be able to do it faster and better (so that's what we are really hoping for).<br/>Read over the incentives on the right-hand side and decide which perks you are interested in. The benefit to you is that the more you offer the better the value because the prizes are cumulative. <br/>Anything helps, so even if you can't reach our lowest reward level you can make it up to us. Every dollar counts.. so donate a dollar if that's all you can do :) The other big way you can help is to tell EVERYONE about this page and what we are doing.

With your help, we can build an effective brand and become a staple in an ever-growing market.</p>
<p><strong>Please remember that you will be refunded if we don't reach our goal. If we do, we will be funded in September when the project ends. We bet 20,000 people could spare $1 dollar.</strong></p>

Boom.  Your Periquette is as unique as you. Customize it to ensure it fits 100% your needs.  Produced on demand. We only use what we need. No stock goes to waste.

Custom made design furniture has never cost less!     These are all the accessories that you will be available to place freely on your nightstand. Missing one you need? Please let us know! Our intention is to be always designing new accessories to improve this nightstand and future products.   Combine the four available colors with the three available finishes as you want. There are so many combinations!  Colors (columns): Black, White, Mustard and Lime.Finishes (rows)Light: oak veneer + light feltDark: wallnut veneer + dark feltWhite: white painted wallnut veneer + light felt    Prices converted to € at checkout.

We are not a traditional company.  We have spent 5 years finding a way to combine our passion for technology, our design engineering know-how, and our ecological awareness. Periquette is the result.By taking advantage of the new technologies of production, communication and distribution, we are able to create a platform in which you choose the product, customize it, and ―only after you place the order― we produce and send it to you.  As for the  future, our intentions are to grow locally wherever there's a big enough community of Periquette users. We don't want to create one huge factory and ship internationally, and we don't need it either. Our dream is to create small factories in every continent/country, this way we can produce locally and ship our goods nearby.Our mission is to make products that suit 100% your needs because we produce them just for you.It's like craftsmanship feat. 21st century tech.   September 2018We start to look for new ways to make a living doing what we love.January 2019Periquette idea sparks.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The GripClip is the brainchild of three old friends; Kevin Hutton, Robin Gupta and Ben Pereira.</p>
<p>Kevin Hutton,</p>
<p>From since as far back as I can remember I was always artistic and design oriented. Years ago when going off to university to decide the direction of my life, I foolishly decided to leave design and creativity by the wayside to pursue Finance. Why? Because A) I can do it and B) it “made sense”; I could get a decent job and go on with life. This proved to be a silly decision that resulted in years of unhappiness and misdirection. I was unhappy but could never really put my finger on why. Fortunately I never completely gave up design and creativity and continued it on the side. I thought this would be “just for fun” yet every time I sat down “for fun” I was happy….very happy. After 37 years I decided to just be me. Be the person I was born to be and not deny myself. The GripClip for me is my proverbial foot being put down and is the beginning of many great ideas to come out of the mind of a much happier person. I guess the big lesson from all of this is to stay true to you.</p>
<p>Robin Gupta,</p>
<p>Love, laughter and creation are all sustenance for the soul. Without them we are but empty vessels. </p>
<p>Taking creation seriously, we came up with The GripClip. Designed to be the best solution for one's jingling change. This is a project that I'm proud of, but i am also pround to be part of a team that has the experience, knowledge, and that soulful need to create great and wonderful things. </p>
<p>Benny Pereira,</p>
<p>I believe that every life has a story and in life you make choices. These choices define you and set the course for the direction of your life. My life is about trying new things, new ideas, for I know these are instruments that lead us into new avenues, new dimensions of our own minds. Without trying what your heart desires, one can never know what each of our spirits are capable of. For all my own life, I took many directions, tried different avenues not knowing. But not knowing gave me the ability to create. In being part of the Grip Clip, this creativity act leaps into endless opportunities.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>What inspired the GripClip was the annoyance of having change floating around in our pockets, making that very embarrassing jingling sound when we walk. Also, we have found that we tend to keep cash separate from our cards so we thought to ourselves “what if we could design a money clip that also holds our change together and stop it from jingling?”. The GripClip is a twp piece detachable money clip:</p>

<h2><strong>What is Cool Grip?</strong></h2>
Cool Grip is an innovative microwaveable tray that never gets hot in the microwave, is safe to handle without oven mitts and helps keep spills, boil overs and messes contained. It stores easily in the microwave and is dishwasher safe.

<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>Where did Cool Grip come from?</strong></h2>
<p>Cool Grip came about after my nieces visited me during their winter break and I microwaved a ton of spaghettio's, ravioli and soup food for them. And over and over, I'd burn my fingers on hot bowls and have messy, spilled food everywhere -- inside the microwave and out. There has to be a better way, I thought. After the nieces left and I scoured the kitchen, I did find a better way. And Cool Grip was born.</p>
<p>Cool Grip is an easy-to-store, dishwasher safe tray that makes microwaving food safe and clean and makes transporting hot food simple. It's a useful, practical kitchen product that's had its share of interest from some of the biggest kitchen product companies in the nation and was a finalist in the TeleBrands Inventors Day Competition. The economy, however, had a hand in keeping Cool Grip from physically getting to market and getting on store shelves. Plus, I definitely want to manufacture this product in the U.S.A., but it's a bit more costly to do that than to send it overseas for production.</p>
<p>That's why I need your help.</p>
<p><img alt=""Safe for kids while keeping your kitchen clean."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/207/028/a81b59ece0edb49eaf03f127481aa0fe_large.png?1350165927"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Safe for kids while keeping your kitchen clean.</h3>
<h2><strong>Why do I want it?</strong></h2>
<p>You want Cool Grip because it is a practical kitchen product. We're all busy, and the microwave is used by every member of the family to heat meals-on-the-go, after school snacks and everything in between. Kids and adults alike can use it to safely microwave and carry food, eliminating spills, burns and messes -- both inside the microwave and around the kitchen. It's dishwasher safe and easily stores right inside the microwave so it's ready for the next person who needs it. Use Cool Grip, and there's no need to use oven mitts or dishtowels to remove hot bowls and plates -- simply grab the handy handles and go.</p>

<h2><strong>Quick and useful facts about Cool Grip</strong></h2>

<p><strong>· Perfect for any kitchen, dorm or workplace</strong></p>
<p><strong>· Expected delivery date is April 2013</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Why do you need funding?</strong></h2>
<p>In this economy, companies are reluctant to provide funding for new products at all, especially those that aren't created inside their own organization. Even though we came amazingly close to having the product produced by large manufacturers, it didn't come to fruition. I'm encouraged and driven by these companies' interest in the product. They all said Cool Grip is a viable, smart product because it's a simple solution to a common problem.</p>
<p>I also am committed to having Cool Grip manufactured in the U.S.A., but it's costly to do that. The injection molding process is very expensive, especially in the United States. With your help, I can give the project to a Midwestern injection molding company and help keep manufacturing jobs stateside and create new jobs at the same time.</p>
<p>Our goal of 8,000 pre-orders will get the Cool Grip up and running right here in the U.S.A.</p>
<h2><strong>What do I get?</strong></h2>
<p>For each $10 you pledge, plus $5.00 for shipping &amp; handling you'll receive one Cool Grip to make your life cleaner, quicker and safer. <br/><em>Sorry backers, but we have no control over the shipping cost. But if you order two Cool Grips, the shipping is the same price as ordering one. Get one for work and one for home, or give one to someone you love -- it makes a great gift for anyone!</em></p>
<h2><strong>Thank you!</strong></h2>
<p>Any support you can provide is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>We believe we have reduced the risk of this project failing due to the fact that we have:</p>
<p>• Solved a common problem that everyone has experienced<br/>• Spent over a year testing tray designs until deciding on the great model seen in our video<br/>• Patent has been filed for and is pending<br/>• Interviewed multiple companies before finding dependable manufacturers that produce quality products<br/>• Filed for our trademark<br/>• Designed a website to showcase the Cool Grip<br/>• Created a Facebook page to stir interest<br/>• Brought on an experienced Sales Rep. with contacts from major retailers<br/>• Secured space to handle any inventory needed</p>
<h3>We believe we have done our homework and that has put us in a spot to succeed. We haven’t rushed this project and have thoroughly researched every aspect and for that reason we have eliminated many pitfalls that a lot of new projects fall in to. We hope after you review our project you will agree and feel confident in backing the Cool Grip.</h3>

The economy, however, had a hand in keeping Cool Grip from physically getting to market and getting on store shelves. Plus, I definitely want to manufacture this product in the U.S.A., but it's a bit more costly to do that than to send it overseas for production.
That's why I need your help.

Safe for kids while keeping your kitchen clean.
Why do I want it?
You want Cool Grip because it is a practical kitchen product. We're all busy, and the microwave is used by every member of the family to heat meals-on-the-go, after school snacks and everything in between. Kids and adults alike can use it to safely microwave and carry food, eliminating spills, burns and messes -- both inside the microwave and around the kitchen. It's dishwasher safe and easily stores right inside the microwave so it's ready for the next person who needs it. Use Cool Grip, and there's no need to use oven mitts or dishtowels to remove hot bowls and plates -- simply grab the handy handles and go.

Perfect for the dorm, because all college students live on ramen noodles.

· Perfect for any kitchen, dorm or workplace
· Expected delivery date is April 2013
Why do you need funding?
In this economy, companies are reluctant to provide funding for new products at all, especially those that aren't created inside their own organization. Even though we came amazingly close to having the product produced by large manufacturers, it didn't come to fruition. I'm encouraged and driven by these companies' interest in the product. They all said Cool Grip is a viable, smart product because it's a simple solution to a common problem.
I also am committed to having Cool Grip manufactured in the U.S.A., but it's costly to do that. The injection molding process is very expensive, especially in the United States. With your help, I can give the project to a Midwestern injection molding company and help keep manufacturing jobs stateside and create new jobs at the same time.
Our goal of 8,000 pre-orders will get the Cool Grip up and running right here in the U.S.A.
What do I get?
For each $10 you pledge, plus $5.00 for shipping & handling you'll receive one Cool Grip to make your life cleaner, quicker and safer. Sorry backers, but we have no control over the shipping cost. But if you order two Cool Grips, the shipping is the same price as ordering one. Get one for work and one for home, or give one to someone you love -- it makes a great gift for anyone!
Thank you!
Any support you can provide is greatly appreciated!
We believe we have reduced the risk of this project failing due to the fact that we have:
• Solved a common problem that everyone has experienced• Spent over a year testing tray designs until deciding on the great model seen in our video• Patent has been filed for and is pending• Interviewed multiple companies before finding dependable manufacturers that produce quality products• Filed for our trademark• Designed a website to showcase the Cool Grip• Created a Facebook page to stir interest• Brought on an experienced Sales Rep. with contacts from major retailers• Secured space to handle any inventory needed
We believe we have done our homework and that has put us in a spot to succeed. We haven’t rushed this project and have thoroughly researched every aspect and for that reason we have eliminated many pitfalls that a lot of new projects fall in to. We hope after you review our project you will agree and feel confident in backing the Cool Grip.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Simu<em>Light</em> Adapter - The Genesis<br/></strong></h2>
<p>Simu<em>Light</em> Adapter was conceived when we came to the realization that complying with the light bulb requirements in recently enacted energy legislation was going to cost us an arm and a leg.</p>
<p>We were faced with replacing the low cost, incandescent flood light bulbs we have all used for years with much more expensive Compact Florescent Light bulbs (CFLs) or Light Emitting Diode bulbs (LEDs). The chart below demonstrates that this represents a significant increase.</p>
<p><img alt=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/586826/pictures/original/20121218112024-RETAIL_BULB_PRICES.jpg?1355858428"" class=""decoded lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/586826/pictures/original/20121218112024-RETAIL_BULB_PRICES.jpg?1355858428"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you look at the CFL bulbs that means paying on average $2.95 versus $8.05. For LEDs it is a difference of $19.40 versus $33.80.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Concept</h2>
<p>The basic challenge in the development of the Simu<em>Light</em> Adapter was to devise a way that a reasonably priced, standard size CLF or LCD bulb could be used in place of a much more expensive Flood Light CFL or LCD bulb in recessed or track lighting.</p>
<p>The solution was to develop a low cost, reusable, plastic shell that would enclose a standard sized bulb, amplify and focus the light, to achieve the same output as a Flood Light.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>   <em>  </em></p>
<h2>The Savings</h2>
<p>The next challenge was to design and produce a product that would fulfill the performance objectives AND make economic sense.  Here is a quick look at how the numbers play out for CFL bulbs.</p>
<h2> <em><img alt=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/586841/pictures/original/20121218112708-SAVINGS.png?1355858837"" class=""decoded lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/586841/pictures/original/20121218112708-SAVINGS.png?1355858837"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></em>
</h2>
<p>On the first usage the savings is slightly over $2.00 for each fixture you have. However, since the Simu<em>Light</em> Adapter is reusable, and durable, you only have to purchase a new bulb when you need to change the light, so <strong>the savings increases to $5.00, every time you change a bulb in the future!</strong></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>A Lot of Bulbs = A Lot of Cash</h2>
<p>Most houses that have recessed or track lights have more than one. Many newer homes have quite a few (we found a guy who had 72!). The chart below illustrates how the savings can add up over time if you have multiple fixtures in your home.</p>

<h2>SimuLight - Good for the Environment</h2>
<p>As our project progressed, we began to also see an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of disposing of hundreds of millions of flood light bulbs every year. Since Simu<em>Light</em> Adapter is reusable, you don't end up contributing all that extra glass to the waste stream every time you change a bulb!</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>More Expensive Bulbs =&gt;=&gt; Unattractive Lighting</h2>
<p>To avoid the relatively high cost of CFL and LED flood light bulbs, many people are opting to use the standard CFL and LED bulbs in recessed or track lighting fixtures. The results are very unattractive light fixtures, which is unfortunate since you invest in these type of light fixtures as much for design and appearance as for the functional light.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever used a droplight (worklight, trouble light, whatever you wanna call it), you’ve had one fail on you. It's frustrating, and it costs you valuable time. When Jesse Kaufman moved his auto repair shop in next to our small LED firm, (where we're designing the brightest, most efficient LED light bulbs) he asked us if we could replace his constantly failing droplight. When we did, we were both amazed. (<a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/drop-led-pro-the-last-work-light-you-will-ever-buy/x/2470460?c=gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Jesse's DropLED Testimonial "">Watch Jesse's testmonial video.</a>)</p>
<p>Over the last six month, he has beaten it mercilessly, and we have refined every aspect of it, such that it is now practically indestructible, perfect for the harsh environment of a repair shop.</p>
<p>The Drop LED Pro is a specially designed LED bulb that fits right into a standard lampholder, but performs like nothing you've ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>It's the Brightest<br/></strong>The DropLED Pro is the Brightest lighting tool you’ll find, delivering 1100 <em>(Photopic)</em> lumens, twice as much light as a 75 watt “Rough Service” bulb. At 4000°K color termperature, it produces 1700 (S<em>cotopic) </em>lumens, for vastly better color definition and three times the eye response. It's also omnidirectional, putting out light in 270 degrees, exactly where you want it. <em><strong>You will see your work in total detail.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""DropLED delivers over 1100 Lumens"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/698684/pictures/full/20130310095152-Brightness.png?1362934318"" src="""" style="""" title=""Brightness""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Safest</strong><br/> If you haven’t burned yourself on a droplight, you probably haven’t worked very much. A Rough Service bulb runs 295°F, while the DropLED <em>Pro</em> is a cool 135°F, so you can grab it with your bare hand. <br/><img alt=""Never Burn Yourself Again"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/698693/pictures/full/20130310100444-Cool_2_Touch_2.png?1362935089"" src="""" style="""" title=""Cool 2 Touch""/></p>
<p>What’s more, RS filaments are over 2500°F, and have <a href=""http://www.dropled.com/Carquest_Droplight_Suit.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">caused explosions that cost millions in damages.</a> Let’s not even get into the dangers of CFLs.</p>
<p><strong>Most Valuable</strong><br/>The DropLED <em>Pro</em> is built for a 50,000 hour lifetime, and we have other models in the oven at the Energy Star test labs to prove it. We warrant the light for 5 years for light output (in case you leave it on 24/7)  and for 3 years against failure (in case you do the kind of things we do to it every day). We calculate the potential savings at up to 100x the cost.<br/><img alt=""After 300 hits, we estimate $7,500 total savings"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/698770/pictures/full/20130310112343-Clock_Total_On_s.png?1362939827"" src="""" style="""" title=""DropLED Savings Clock""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>One thing we're sure of, your lamp holder will fail long before the DropLED Pro. After the forklift, we tossed this one 20' up in the air and it blew apart when it hit. You can see the gravel marks on the body, and the globe was crushed too, but functionally, the DropLED was unphased.<img alt=""The Lampholder Can't Take What The DropLED Can"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/698716/pictures/full/20130310102331-Busted.jpg?1362936214"" src="""" style="""" title=""Busted!""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>LED</strong><br/>At a mere 12 watts, it will also save you over $500 in electricity, but its brightness and safety make it more valuable than money can define. Every mechanic we’ve shown it to wants one, and we are ready to deliver.<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong><strong>Lighting Tool in the World</strong><br/></strong>The DropLED <em>Pro</em> works in any country, from 90-240v AC. The DLP drastically outperforms every other light out there, and it's value only increases the further you get from the US.

<p><strong>IndieGoGo Helps Us Both</strong></p>
<p>If you're reading this, you probably run a small business, so you know what it costs to get one off the ground. We'd like to build the DropLED without selling off the company, and your support is key. Pledging now will get <strong><em>you</em> </strong>the DropLED Pro, and make it available for every mechanic who’s tired of of expensive, wasteful, weak and dangerous drop lights. It will allow <strong><em>us</em> </strong>to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay off initial tooling and testing expenses</li>
<li>Build our first production run<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul><p><strong>Who is Lumen LED?</strong></p>
<p>We’re tiny now, but Lumen’s engineers have decades of experience with LEDs, in aerospace and hi-tech applications. They have designed and delivered for BART, Hughes, Intel, KLA-Tencor, Lawrence Labs, Maxtor, NASA, Quantum, Seagate, and Sun Microsystems, among others. When we complete our full line of Energy Star qualified lights, we’ll be on the road to saving billions of dollars in wasted energy every year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We truly appreciate your support. If a DropLED Pro will help you, help us by buying one (or more) right now! Even if you don’t use a drop light, you can help us by</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing this with <strong><em>your</em></strong> mechanic, tradesmen, and friends (Use the Indiegogo share tools!)</li>
<li>Donating the minimimum, and gettng a sticker!</li>
<li>Blogging about us, or referring us to other media</li>
<li>Volunteering in any way you can</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p><strong>Thanks<br/></strong>We want to thank all of you for supporting us, and give a special shout out to all the mechanics and shops that helped us torture test this thing.</p>

Safest If you haven’t burned yourself on a droplight, you probably haven’t worked very much. A Rough Service bulb runs 295°F, while the DropLED Pro is a cool 135°F, so you can grab it with your bare hand. 
What’s more, RS filaments are over 2500°F, and have caused explosions that cost millions in damages. Let’s not even get into the dangers of CFLs.
Most ValuableThe DropLED Pro is built for a 50,000 hour lifetime, and we have other models in the oven at the Energy Star test labs to prove it. We warrant the light for 5 years for light output (in case you leave it on 24/7)  and for 3 years against failure (in case you do the kind of things we do to it every day). We calculate the potential savings at up to 100x the cost.
 
One thing we're sure of, your lamp holder will fail long before the DropLED Pro. After the forklift, we tossed this one 20' up in the air and it blew apart when it hit. You can see the gravel marks on the body, and the globe was crushed too, but functionally, the DropLED was unphased.
 
LEDAt a mere 12 watts, it will also save you over $500 in electricity, but its brightness and safety make it more valuable than money can define. Every mechanic we’ve shown it to wants one, and we are ready to deliver.
Lighting Tool in the WorldThe DropLED Pro works in any country, from 90-240v AC. The DLP drastically outperforms every other light out there, and it's value only increases the further you get from the US. Read this document Comparing the Drop LED Pro with other lights.   (Order the LeMans - for international delivery)
 
IndieGoGo Helps Us Both
If you're reading this, you probably run a small business, so you know what it costs to get one off the ground. We'd like to build the DropLED without selling off the company, and your support is key. Pledging now will get you the DropLED Pro, and make it available for every mechanic who’s tired of of expensive, wasteful, weak and dangerous drop lights. It will allow us to:

Pay off initial tooling and testing expenses
Build our first production run

Who is Lumen LED?
We’re tiny now, but Lumen’s engineers have decades of experience with LEDs, in aerospace and hi-tech applications. They have designed and delivered for BART, Hughes, Intel, KLA-Tencor, Lawrence Labs, Maxtor, NASA, Quantum, Seagate, and Sun Microsystems, among others. When we complete our full line of Energy Star qualified lights, we’ll be on the road to saving billions of dollars in wasted energy every year.
 
How You Can Help
We truly appreciate your support. If a DropLED Pro will help you, help us by buying one (or more) right now! Even if you don’t use a drop light, you can help us by

Sharing this with your mechanic, tradesmen, and friends (Use the Indiegogo share tools!)
Donating the minimimum, and gettng a sticker!
Blogging about us, or referring us to other media
Volunteering in any way you can
 
ThanksWe want to thank all of you for supporting us, and give a special shout out to all the mechanics and shops that helped us torture test this thing.

Nothing really fancy? Squeaky Speaker Sound?Well, we were highly unsatisfied with that situation as well and became very passionate to put it to an end!With your help we will be able to launch the world's first smart lifestyle mirror on the market!With MIRROReins you can:
...not only display your reflection but the digital reflection of YOUR areas of interest! YOUR favorite CONTENT at a glance! 
...experience richer music in your bathroom thanks to built-in stereo speakers!

...have a slim and clean designed mirror with hidden magic power! 



MIRROReins dimensions & specs:




SIZE: Does the mirror fit into your bathroom? Most certainly, because with 80 x 60cm (35.43 x 23.62 inch) it comes in standard size.


MOTION SENSOR: Is the screen always on? No, thanks to the hidden, built-in motion sensor. The display will only turn on if you're close by.

INTEGRATED DISPLAY: How big is big? With 21"" it has ""just the right size for sufficient information and at the same time for your reflection.

ON/OFF SWITCH: Do you want to see yourself in full beauty? Just use the external on/off switch for the display.

OPERATING SYSTEM: Another new system? No. Thanks to the Android operating system there are almost no limits for further development.

INPUT-DEVICE: Fingerprints on the screen? No way! An magic air mouse is included with delivery of MIRROReins. Configure your MIRROReins or control other Android Apps with this awesome device.


RESOLUTION: Don't like a fuzzy display? No worries, thanks to the Full HD display you can see everything crystal clear and not pixelated.


POWER: Is the processor fast enough? 
Absolutely! Thanks to a powerful Quad core processor you get plenty 
of power for future improvements






Challenges (extract):
Apart from the commercials (e.g. the first engineering partner disappointment) the had to overcome the following obstacles:

Mirror glass (size? mirrorized? foiled?)
Screen (brightness vs. mirror effect)
Heat development vs. moisture / bathroom steam
Sound quality: Speaker / amplifier selection (believe us, it's tougher than it ""sounds"")
Configuration of MIRROReins - focused on usability

History:



What happens when you get your MIRROReins?


Time to get excited :-) 
Choose vertical/optical mounting (both is possible)
Connect to power and MIRROReins will awake
Use remote control to connect to your home WiFi  and log in into your Mirrorized-account (one time only)

Now go to www.mirrorized.de and proceed with the last step:


   6. Easy-peasy, done!   7. MIRROReins is now ready to get you Mirrorized!


MIRROReins FEATURES to choose from:




How can YOU support the bathroom evolution?

Utilizing our background in Telecommunications, IT & Web we invested a lot of passion, brainpower and time over the past 18 month to get this close to production. 
But only with your support we can continue to work on the dream and help your bathroom to be converted into a real WOW-experience, ready for the 21st century!
You can support best by choosing a perk:







Please bear in mind that potential toll fees in your country are not included in the price.

Why do we need your support?

Well, we need to hit the funding limit of 650.000€ to finance: 


the first MIRROReins order
a production tool for the mass production (according to our special design requirements) 

the software/app optimization (as designed) 


If Indiegogo gets absolutely mirrorized and we hit 899.000€ we will be eternally thankful and reward you by adding ""voice control"" for free.

<h3>0-OUT Water Filter: clean and tasty water from your tap    </h3>
<p>The course of tap water and the overconsumption of plastic have a drastic impact on the quality of the water we drink. The more we consume plastic, the more we pollute our environment, eventually threatening our own health. To interrupt this cycle, we have created <strong>0-OUT, the ultimate water filter that delivers 1000 liter KM zero clean and tasty water directly through your kitchen tap</strong>.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593502304/ddjuh7chtupxqlr8mkll.png"" src=""""/></h3>

<p>Numbers speak clearly: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>750 plastic bottles a </strong><b>year, consumed</b> in average by a family of three, out of which<strong> only 7% is recycled</strong>. It will take up to 450 years for non-recycled waste to degrade;  </li>
<li>
<strong>5 grams of plastic a week</strong>, ingested approximately by one person, <strong>89% of which from drinking water</strong>; </li>
<li>
<strong>additives and microplastics </strong>inevitably infiltrate the common tap water, leaving the water <strong>full of harmful substances and with a bad taste</strong>;</li>
<li><u>as today to buy bottles of water is a <strong>waste of money and time</strong>.</u></li>
</ul>
<p><i><strong>0-OUT </strong>is set to drastically decrease the use of single-use plastics at home and  at the office, while</i></p>

<h3>How can we install and use 0-OUT?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/cMif1J407YCygVXyxK/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Using 0-OUT is as easy as drinking a glass of water!<br/>The filter can be easily installed in less than 10 seconds, without the help of an expert. <br/>It adapts to any kind of tap, it's small and lightweight.<br/>Once installed, thanks to the dual ways out system, you can choose among using filtered or unfiltered water, preventing the waste of clean water.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why is it convenient?</h3>
<p>Considering that <strong>a family of four consumes about 830 LT a year</strong>, we calculated that <strong>using 0-OUT can save up to $ 1.000 and 500 water bottles every three years!</strong></p>
<p>Why not use the saved money to go on holiday?!</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Antibacterial materials</strong>: the carbon block is implemented with silver to avoid the proliferation of bacteria and microalgae after long periods of<br/>inactivity, but has no effect on the elimination of potential bacteria present in the water supply.</li>
<li>
<strong>Double action filter, chelating resins</strong>: the chelating resins reduce the presence of heavy metals, including iron and copper, which alter the taste of water.</li>
<li>
<strong>Double action filter, activated carbon filter</strong>: the activated carbon filters reduces chlorine and eliminates odours and flavours. It also blocks the microplastic up to ten<br/>times more than the standard size.</li>
<li>
<strong>BPA free material</strong>: entirely made with BPA (Bisphenol A) free material. BPA free material is usually used to make baby bottles.</li>
<li>
<strong>Switch filtered / unfiltered water</strong>: if not needed, it can be easily switched to unfiltered water mode to save filters.</li>
<li>
<strong>Retains microplastic</strong>: the activated carbon filters microplastic up to 0,5 micrometers: ten times smaller the standard size.</li>
<li>
<strong>Live update on the state of the filters</strong>: smart system monitors the state of wear of the filters and updates you when they need to be replaced.</li>
<li>
<strong>Bluetooth connection</strong>: it connects to your phone using Bluetooth technology.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mobile App</strong>: monitor the state of the filter, replace it by accessing our online shop, check how much you are saving.</li>

<p>0-OUT was born to be used everywhere you want: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Kitchen and Home</strong>: it can be mounted in less than 10 seconds on every type of kitchen tap. With few simple moves it can change the way we consume tap water forever, delivering directly to people homes the freshest and cleanest water they ever had; </li>
<li>
<strong>Office and Work Environment</strong>: one of our goals is to get rid of the environmental and economic costs of bottled water. Once implemented within work environments, companies, institutions, the filter will help save money while fostering sustainable workplaces.</li>

<p>For over 45 years <strong>Pea&amp;Promoplast</strong> has created innovative products and developed promotional and editorial campaigns for the biggest European multinationals. In the last years, we have gone through an industrial and digital transformation whose objective is to reduce the environmental impact of our products and those of millions of consumers. <br/>In light of this priority, we are focusing on the creation of sustainable devices that will impact our world for the better.<br/><strong>0-OUT is one of the life-improving devices</strong> that we created to decrease the consumption of plastic bottles while delivering clean and tasty tap water. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>Our goal is to create a product which: </p>
<ul>
<li>filters heavy metals, harmful elements, microplastic, chlorine and bacteria, making tap water healthier and tastier;</li>
<li>it's lightweight, small and easy to install;</li>
<li>help people reducing the consumption of plastic and saving money.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being a company which produced the greatest part of its products by using plastics, we want to show and demonstrate we really want to make a radical change and do something important to support the plastic-free cause. </p>

<h2>0-OUT Water Filter: acqua buona e pulita dal tuo rubinetto</h2>
<p>Il percorso dell’acqua del rubinetto e il consumo eccessivo della plastica hanno un impatto considerevole sulla qualità dell’acqua che beviamo. Più plastica consumiamo, più inquiniamo l’ambiente, mettendo a rischio la nostra salute. Per interrompere questo ciclo, abbiamo creato <strong>0-OUT, il filtro dell'acqua per eccellenza che eroga 1000 litri di acqua buona e pulita a KM 0 direttamente attraverso il tuo rubinetto</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>750 bottiglie di plastica all'anno, consumate</strong> in media da una famiglia di tre persone, di cui<strong> solo il 7% viene riciclato</strong>. Ci vorranno fino a 450 anni perché i rifiuti non riciclati si biodegradino;</li>
<li>
<strong>5 grammi di plastica a settimana </strong>, approssimativamente ingeriti da una persona, <strong>l'89% dei quali dall'acqua potabile</strong>;</li>

<p>Il dispositivo 0-out consente di purificare l'acqua da <strong>oltre 140 sostanze</strong>, come ad esempio:</p>
<ul>
<li>PESTICIDI (glifosato, bentazone, ecc.),</li>
<li>METALLI PESANTI (mercurio, cadmio, arsenico, rame, nichel, ecc.),</li>
<li>microplastiche,</li>
<li>CLORO.</li>

<h3>Come si installa e utilizza 0-OUT?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/cMif1J407YCygVXyxK/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Usare 0-OUT è facile come bere un bicchiere d'acqua!<br/>Il filtro può essere facilmente installato in meno di 10 secondi, senza l'aiuto di un esperto.<br/>Si adatta a qualsiasi tipo di rubinetto, è piccolo e leggero.<br/>Una volta installato, grazie al sistema a doppia uscita, è possibile scegliere tra l'utilizzo di acqua filtrata o non filtrata, evitando lo spreco di acqua pulita.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perché conviene?</h3>
<p>Considerando che <strong>una famiglia di quattro persone consuma circa 830 LT all'anno</strong>, abbiamo calcolato che l' <strong>uso di 0-OUT può far risparmiare fino a $ 1.000 e 500 bottiglie d'acqua ogni tre anni!</strong></p>

0-OUT Water Filter: clean and tasty water from your tap    
The course of tap water and the overconsumption of plastic have a drastic impact on the quality of the water we drink. The more we consume plastic, the more we pollute our environment, eventually threatening our own health. To interrupt this cycle, we have created 0-OUT, the ultimate water filter that delivers 1000 liter KM zero clean and tasty water directly through your kitchen tap.

 
Why 0-OUT?

 

 
 
Numbers speak clearly: 


750 plastic bottles a year, consumed in average by a family of three, out of which only 7% is recycled. It will take up to 450 years for non-recycled waste to degrade;  

5 grams of plastic a week, ingested approximately by one person, 89% of which from drinking water; 

additives and microplastics inevitably infiltrate the common tap water, leaving the water full of harmful substances and with a bad taste;
as today to buy bottles of water is a waste of money and time.

0-OUT is set to drastically decrease the use of single-use plastics at home and  at the office, while
getting rid of all harmful elements and allow you to drink healthier and tastier water
 
Why do we need to use a tap water filter?


What are the main characteristics of 0-OUT?


0-OUT is characterized by a Double Filtering Action:


Spyral Technology: retaining the majority of heavy metals, preventing the metallic aftertaste  of tap watered and enhancing the quality of the water we drink filtrating 99% of contaminants; 

Activated Carbons: removing chlorine, particles and organic compounds, blocking the microplastics up to 10X more than the standard size while making tap water fresh and odour-free. 

IOS and Android Mobile App: we also develop a mobile app, enabling you to real-time monitor filter consumption, plastic bottles and money-saving.

 
0-OUT filter design and colours

Product features: 

BPA Free Material
Patented Ionix Spiral
Bluetooth litre-counter system
Double filtering action
Silver filtering material

0-OUT filter is available in 4 different colours: orange, chrome, black, white.Choose your favourite one!

How many and what kind of elements do 0-OUT filter?

The 0-out device allows to purify water from over 140 substances, such as:

PESTICIDES (glyphosate, bentazone, etc.),
HEAVY METALS (mercury, cadmium, arsenic, copper, nickel, etc.),
MICROPLASTICS,
CHLORINE.

These substances are abated following the standards NSF 42, NSF53 and NSF401.
 
How can we install and use 0-OUT?

Using 0-OUT is as easy as drinking a glass of water!The filter can be easily installed in less than 10 seconds, without the help of an expert. It adapts to any kind of tap, it's small and lightweight.Once installed, thanks to the dual ways out system, you can choose among using filtered or unfiltered water, preventing the waste of clean water.
 
Why is it convenient?
Considering that a family of four consumes about 830 LT a year, we calculated that using 0-OUT can save up to $ 1.000 and 500 water bottles every three years!
Why not use the saved money to go on holiday?!

 
What are the main differences between 0-OUT and other tap water filter?

 
What are the technical characteristics of the filter?
 


Antibacterial materials: the carbon block is implemented with silver to avoid the proliferation of bacteria and microalgae after long periods ofinactivity, but has no effect on the elimination of potential bacteria present in the water supply.

Double action filter, chelating resins: the chelating resins reduce the presence of heavy metals, including iron and copper, which alter the taste of water.

Double action filter, activated carbon filter: the activated carbon filters reduces chlorine and eliminates odours and flavours. It also blocks the microplastic up to tentimes more than the standard size.

BPA free material: entirely made with BPA (Bisphenol A) free material. BPA free material is usually used to make baby bottles.

Switch filtered / unfiltered water: if not needed, it can be easily switched to unfiltered water mode to save filters.

Retains microplastic: the activated carbon filters microplastic up to 0,5 micrometers: ten times smaller the standard size.

Live update on the state of the filters: smart system monitors the state of wear of the filters and updates you when they need to be replaced.

Bluetooth connection: it connects to your phone using Bluetooth technology.

Mobile App: monitor the state of the filter, replace it by accessing our online shop, check how much you are saving.

 
When and where can you use 0-OUT?
 
0-OUT was born to be used everywhere you want: 


Kitchen and Home: it can be mounted in less than 10 seconds on every type of kitchen tap. With few simple moves it can change the way we consume tap water forever, delivering directly to people homes the freshest and cleanest water they ever had; 

Office and Work Environment: one of our goals is to get rid of the environmental and economic costs of bottled water. Once implemented within work environments, companies, institutions, the filter will help save money while fostering sustainable workplaces.

 
What about the birth of 0-OUT?

 
We want to develop a product which filters harmful elements, heavy metals, chlorine, microplastics, bacterias, making water healthier and tastier. To achieve our goal, we worked alongside Dr. Claudio Minero, Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the University of Turin, to make sure we developed the most efficient tap water filter and we teamed together to monitor the results of our research and design a powerful and long-lasting filter.At the end of our research and work, we achieved our goal and created a filter with our patented technology.

 VERSIONE IN ITALIANO
 
0-OUT Water Filter: acqua buona e pulita dal tuo rubinetto
Il percorso dell’acqua del rubinetto e il consumo eccessivo della plastica hanno un impatto considerevole sulla qualità dell’acqua che beviamo. Più plastica consumiamo, più inquiniamo l’ambiente, mettendo a rischio la nostra salute. Per interrompere questo ciclo, abbiamo creato 0-OUT, il filtro dell'acqua per eccellenza che eroga 1000 litri di acqua buona e pulita a KM 0 direttamente attraverso il tuo rubinetto.

 
 
Perché 0-OUT?


I numeri parlano chiaramente:


750 bottiglie di plastica all'anno, consumate in media da una famiglia di tre persone, di cui solo il 7% viene riciclato. Ci vorranno fino a 450 anni perché i rifiuti non riciclati si biodegradino;

5 grammi di plastica a settimana , approssimativamente ingeriti da una persona, l'89% dei quali dall'acqua potabile;

gli additivi e le microplastiche permeano inevitabilmente nell'acqua del rubinetto, lasciando l'acqua piena di sostanze nocive e con un cattivo gusto;
al giorno d'oggi acquistare bottiglie d'acqua è uno spreco di tempo e denaro.

0-OUT è progettato per ridurre drasticamente l'uso di plastica monouso a casa e in ufficio e contemporanemente elimina tutte le sostanze dannose consentendo di bere acqua più sana.
 
Perché c’è bisogno di usare un filtro per l'acqua del rubinetto?


Quali sono le principali caratteristiche di 0-OUT?


0-OUT è caratterizzato da una doppia azione di filtraggio:


Tecnologia a Spirale: trattiene la maggior parte dei metalli pesanti, previene il retrogusto metallico dell'acqua del rubinetto e ne migliora la qualità filtrando il 99% dei contaminanti;

Carboni attivi: rimuovono cloro, particelle e composti organici, bloccando le microplastiche fino a 10 volte in più rispetto alle dimensioni standard, rendendo l'acqua del rubinetto fresca e inodore.

App mobile per IOS e Android: abbiamo sviluppato anche un'app mobile, che consente di monitorare in tempo reale il consumo dei filtri e il risparmio di bottiglie di plastica e di denaro.

Quante e che tipo di specie chimiche filtra 0-OUT?

 
Il dispositivo 0-out consente di purificare l'acqua da oltre 140 sostanze, come ad esempio:

PESTICIDI (glifosato, bentazone, ecc.),
METALLI PESANTI (mercurio, cadmio, arsenico, rame, nichel, ecc.),
microplastiche,
CLORO.

Queste sostanze vengono ridotte secondo gli standard NSF 42, NSF53 e NSF401.
 
Come si installa e utilizza 0-OUT?

Usare 0-OUT è facile come bere un bicchiere d'acqua!Il filtro può essere facilmente installato in meno di 10 secondi, senza l'aiuto di un esperto.Si adatta a qualsiasi tipo di rubinetto, è piccolo e leggero.Una volta installato, grazie al sistema a doppia uscita, è possibile scegliere tra l'utilizzo di acqua filtrata o non filtrata, evitando lo spreco di acqua pulita.
 
Perché conviene?
Considerando che una famiglia di quattro persone consuma circa 830 LT all'anno, abbiamo calcolato che l' uso di 0-OUT può far risparmiare fino a $ 1.000 e 500 bottiglie d'acqua ogni tre anni!
Perché non usare i soldi risparmiati per andare in vacanza ?!

Quali sono le principali differenze tra 0-OUT e altri filtri per l'acqua del rubinetto?

 
Quali sono le caratteristiche tecniche del filtro?

 


Materiali antibatterici: il blocco di carbone attivo è implementato con argento per evitare la proliferazione di batteri e microalghe dopo lunghi periodi di inattività, ma non ha alcun effetto sull'eliminazione di potenziali batteri presenti nell'approvvigionamento idrico.

Filtro a doppia azione, resine chelanti: le resine chelanti riducono la presenza di metalli pesanti, tra cui ferro e rame, che alterano il sapore dell'acqua.

Filtro a doppia azione, filtro a carbone attivo: i filtri a carbone attivo riducono il cloro ed eliminano odori e sapori. Inoltre, blocca le microplastiche fino a dieci volte in più rispetto alle dimensioni standard.

Materiale privo di BPA: interamente realizzato con materiale privo di BPA (bisfenolo A). Il materiale privo di BPA viene solitamente utilizzato per realizzare biberon.

Passaggio acqua filtrata / non filtrata: se non necessario, si può facilmente passare in modalità acqua non filtrata per risparmiare i filtri.

Trattiene le microplastiche: i carboni attivi filtrano microplastiche fino a 0,5 micrometri: dieci volte più piccoli delle dimensioni standard.

Aggiornamento in tempo reale sullo stato dei filtri: il sistema intelligente monitora lo stato di usura dei filtri e ti aggiorna quando è necessario sostituirli.

Connessione Bluetooth: si collega al telefono tramite la tecnologia bluetooth.

App mobile: monitora lo stato del filtro, permette di sostituirlo accedendo al nostro negozio online, controlla quanto stai risparmiando.

 
Quando e dove è possibile utilizzare 0-OUT?
 

 
0-OUT è nato per essere utilizzato ovunque tu voglia:


Cucina e casa: può essere montato in meno di 10 secondi su ogni tipo di rubinetto della cucina. Con poche semplici mosse può cambiare per sempre il modo di consumare l’acqua del rubinetto, fornendo direttamente a casa l’acqua più fresca e pura mai avuta;

Ufficio e ambiente di lavoro: uno dei nostri obiettivi è quello di eliminare i costi ambientali ed economici dell'acqua in bottiglia. Una volta implementato all’interno degli ambienti di lavoro, aziende e istituzioni, il filtro aiuterà a risparmiare denaro promuovendo ambienti di lavoro sostenibili.

 
Com'è nato 0-OUT?

 
Abbiamo sviluppato un prodotto che filtra sostanze dannose, metalli pesanti, cloro, microplastiche e batteri, rendendo l'acqua più buona e sana.Per raggiungere il nostro obiettivo, abbiamo lavorato a fianco del Dott. Claudio Minero, professore di Chimica analitica all'Università di Torino, con il quale abbiamo collaborato per monitorare i risultati della nostra ricerca e progettare un efficiente filtro a lunga durata con tecnologia brevettata.

Negli ultimi anni, abbiamo attraversato una trasformazione industriale e digitale, il cui obiettivo è quello di ridurre l’impatto ambientale della nostra azienda e di quella di milioni di consumatori. . Nell’ottica di questa priorità, ci stiamo concentrando sulla creazione di dispositivi sostenibili che potrebbero avere un impatto positivo sul nostro pianeta.0-Out è uno di quei dispositivi rivoluzionari che abbiamo creato per ridurre il consumo di bottiglie di plastica, fornendo al tempo stesso acqua del rubinetto buona e pulita.
 
Rischi e sfide
Il nostro obiettivo è creare un prodotto che:

filtri metalli pesanti, sostanze nocive, microplastiche, cloro e batteri, rendendo l'acqua del rubinetto più buona e sana;
sia leggero, piccolo e facile da installare;
aiuti le persone a ridurre il consumo di plastica e risparmiare denaro.

Come azienda che ha realizzato la maggior parte dei suoi prodotti in plastica, vogliamo essere promotori di un cambiamento radicale e fare qualcosa di importante per sostenere la causa plastic free.",90.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><p>According to AARP, nearly 90% of seniors want to stay in their own homes as long as possible. It is not only a natural desire but also much better from an economic standpoint because of the high cost of assisted living accommodations. Yet we know that accidents and sudden illness can strike even healthy older people in the home and that family members may be concerned that such an incident may go unnoticed. The red tulip system has been designed to address this concern. Inconspicuous sensors strategically placed in the home track normal activity detected and provide alerts if abnormal activity, such as not going to the kitchen in the morning, is detected. Immediate alerts are activated by the fall detection sensors.</p><p> </p><p>Wireless sensors around the house send messages to the Internet gateway device at a central location in the home which is in contact with the cloud. If anything is abnormal, a ringtone alert at the gateway occurs. If the ringtone alert is not cleared, an alert message is sent to the cloud via the gateway. If not answered, caregivers are alerted by email, text message or phone. No cameras or microphones are present to insure privacy. Caregivers are not contacted without prior permission of the homeowner.     </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533155730/rvdego4ivr4tz0zmgblq.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Wireless sensors around home transmit to gateway</i></p><h3><strong>The Gateway</strong></h3><div style=""float: right;"">

<p><strong>Sick of the rat race and still want to maximize property returns?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sustainable lifestyle</strong></li>
<li><strong>Something for everyone</strong></li>
<li><strong>Eco-Friendly</strong></li>
</ul><p>Governments can only do so much and corporations have every right to profit for their stakeholders.  Co-operatives are about people working together, sharing resources, equality and equity.  Kimba is leading the way with a hybrid model that meets the needs of the savvy property investor (active or passive), with a new collaborative model that not only builds ecologically sustainable communities but also makes people happy.</p>
<p><strong>Our Mission:</strong></p>
<p>Kimba Housing Cooperative will be a not-for-profit trading organisation which creates ecologically sustainable communities comprising residential and commercial properties in regional and remote areas of the World.</p>
<ul>
<li>Kimba properties are in a community’s title scheme which means all occupants on lots share services including solar / wind power, water, and broadband and sewage treatment.</li>
<li>Most Kimba developments will provide facilities for health (Medical Clinics) and education kiosks, to support key workers like teachers and doctors.</li>
<li>Kimba Commercial properties support professionals, shop keepers and manufacturing industries. E.g. Baker, Dairy and other Cottage</li>
</ul><p>All Kimba members are entitled to vote on issues concerning how their community is to be managed.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>As a member you are funding the <strong>establishment</strong> of the cooperative community with any further investment surplus plus your original investment returned to you (A disclosure statement will be sent to you on request). Surpluses are a result of property sales and rental income received less expenses.</p>
<p>Investment funds are used to purchase land from struggling owners in regional and remote areas. Kimba sells some properties off the plan and leases the remainder to members for the short or long term with the option to buy any time.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Kimba Housing Cooperative
Sick of the rat race and still want to maximize property returns?

Sustainable lifestyle
Something for everyone
Eco-Friendly
Governments can only do so much and corporations have every right to profit for their stakeholders.  Co-operatives are about people working together, sharing resources, equality and equity.  Kimba is leading the way with a hybrid model that meets the needs of the savvy property investor (active or passive), with a new collaborative model that not only builds ecologically sustainable communities but also makes people happy.
Our Mission:
Kimba Housing Cooperative will be a not-for-profit trading organisation which creates ecologically sustainable communities comprising residential and commercial properties in regional and remote areas of the World.

Kimba properties are in a community’s title scheme which means all occupants on lots share services including solar / wind power, water, and broadband and sewage treatment.
Most Kimba developments will provide facilities for health (Medical Clinics) and education kiosks, to support key workers like teachers and doctors.
Kimba Commercial properties support professionals, shop keepers and manufacturing industries. E.g. Baker, Dairy and other Cottage
All Kimba members are entitled to vote on issues concerning how their community is to be managed.
What We Need & What You Get
As a member you are funding the establishment of the cooperative community with any further investment surplus plus your original investment returned to you (A disclosure statement will be sent to you on request). Surpluses are a result of property sales and rental income received less expenses.
Investment funds are used to purchase land from struggling owners in regional and remote areas. Kimba sells some properties off the plan and leases the remainder to members for the short or long term with the option to buy any time.
The Impact
Kimba Housing Cooperative provides affordable solutions that get anyone into ecologically sustainable housing and employment whilst also offering a low risk and above average return to the passive property investor.

These problems work against honey bees’ preservation in myriad ways, some can even kill them. There is always an element of mystery involving a new product launch, and one can’t always predict if the product will be a success, or not. We presented our products to see if they were in line with what beekeepers are willing to pay for a top-quality, innovative hive. For lack of substantial backers, thus far, we’ve curtailed further attempts to sell this product line-up in its present form. All backers who did support our first crowdfunding campaign will be refunded 100% of their donation following the expiration of the campaign.</p><p>As a serial inventor with 22 years-experience - with many commercial successes <i>and</i> failures - I anticipated that I might not hit a home run the first time at bat with a beekeeping product. So, at the time of the launch of this campaign, I was already finishing the prototype of a hive design that is simpler and cheaper to produce, and includes all of the positive attributes of its Honey Bee Defender predecessor. We will re-launch, in early 2020, with this less expensive model we call the <u>Honey Bee Defender II</u>.</p><p>Bee Fortress is making a <i>limited</i> production run of the Honey Bee Defender II to give away to experienced beekeepers who wish to put our hive into practice and collect data on its performance in the field, then, provide an unbiased critique of this new hive design. If you are interested in becoming part of this program, we invite you to contact us. We are seeking candidates who are experienced beekeepers - ones who’ve mastered the fundamentals of beekeeping - so we can more precisely assess the value that the Honey Bee Defender II offers them, and its outcome in service of providing an advanced home for honey bees.</p><p>We are aware that most causes of honey bee colony deaths aren’t hive-related. We are also aware that Varroa Destructor mite infestations is the biggest issue in beekeeping today, which is why I have been working on a solution that will soon be ready for action. I believe that my developing solution can eradicate mites infecting a colony at the rate of one colony per hour.

<p><b>2. What is in the package? Do I have to buy the strap separately?<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The strap is included in the package.

<p><b>3. Does it support GoPro Hero4 as well?<br/></b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The REMOVU P1 is proven to work with all versions of GoPro 3 and 3+. And we are currently working on the firmware for Hero 4 compatibility.  REMOVU P1 will be compatible with Hero4 Silver/Black.</span></p>
<p><b>4. Is there a time gap between GoPro and REMOVU P1?<br/></b>The REMOVU uses the GoPro App functions to stream the live view, thus depending on the working environment, delay of  1 ~ 1.5 seconds can be expected.  </p>
<p><b>5. I usually use multiple cameras to shoot my scenes. Is it possible to switch between cameras?</b><br/>You can switch cameras by switching to different SSID on the Wi-Fi SSID list.</p>
<p><b>6. What color is the REMOVU P1?<br/></b>We only have the  black version at this time, but with your support, we can expand our color variations. If we reach our $100K goal, we will be able to make the REMOVU P1 in white. </p>
<p><b>7. Can I use REMOVU P1 under water?</b><br/>Absolutely NO!  REMOVU P1 is only splashproof so it can be wet but not under water.  Also Wi-Fi signal does not work under water. <br/></p>

<h4>This unique XMOOVE is patent pending. XMOOVE table and pendant luminaires form a small product family made to the very highest design and quality standards.</h4>
<p>XMOOVE is made by laser sintering, which permits fabrication of a pre-drilled unit complete with working joints and cable conduits in a single operation. The luminaire housing is created layer by layer, using laser technology to fuse particles of a high-tech polyamide powder. The distinguishing features of this material include long-term stability, resistance to wear, light-weight construction and translucency. A layer density of 120 µm makes for optimal mechanical properties, surface quality and precision. The high-quality printing operation and the assembly of the LED boards take place in Germany.</p>

It is as versatile as you, and adapts to every situation in your life.   The Story about XMOOVEI have worked as a designer and creator in the lighting industry for more than 20 years. Luminaires with surprising features and flexibility are my passion. ""If the concept and design are right and smart control is incorporated for good lighting quality, I reckon you have a perfect product – and that is how I feel about XMOOVE"".     Easy to adjust from 30x32 cm to 1.4m x 0.14mMy team and I believe we have created a thrilling, exclusive luminaire series – one that will impress you with its design and performance. We aim to deliver uniqueness and individualityrather than a product suitable for the mass market.  
 XMOOVE is made of of high-tech polyamide, a white-translucent and valuable material
 

Manufactured in one piece

The luminaire is delivered completely and ready-to-use fully operational, pre-drilled and and wired for connection – manufactured in one piece with a selective sintering laser machine. It took one and a half year to develop this luminaire which is characterized by its interlocking shape.Noother production method would made it possible to manufacture such an exquisite luminairewhose design / is not disturbed by any screws.
3D printing finally enables us to produce this new kind of aesthetics.

 
 Just Perfect Light: ""Tunable White"" and ""Amber-Special""
 

You can select your perfect light by simply installing the free Casambi App on your smartphone/tablet (Android or IOS). With the ""tunable-white"" you can select a cool bright light for work and concentration, ... or you can tune in a warm ""amber light"" for a cozy mood.
 
The pendant luminaire and the desk luminaire are both adjustable from 3.100 Kelvin through 2.500 Kelvin to an orange warm-tone light colour (about 1.700K and about 585nm)!!!
With XMOOVE you can tune your light from a white to a warm orange.
The custom-made LED boards are fitted with OSRAM high-quality LEDs. The combination with amber LEDs enables the light colour to be changed to produce a very homely and agreeable warm-tone light. Brightness is infinitely dimmable irrespective of light colour.
 
A control app is available free of charge for all mobile devices (Android and IOS). 
If you don´t want to use your smartphone - just use the switch. The pendant luminaire and the table luminaire are both equipped with a switch to control the brightness or to switch the light on and off. For adjusting the amber tone, please use your smartphone.
 Desk Luminaire

<li>
<strong>What if I don't have an available ethernet port to connect the Tempy gateway?</strong><br/><br/>No problem. Affordable <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Ethernet-Splitter-Unmanaged-TL-SF1005D/dp/B000FNFSPY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">multiport ethernet switches</a> can be found and bought through Amazon.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>What is the Tempy sensor’s battery life?</strong><br/><br/><i>Tempy sensors will last up to 10 years using alkaline batteries (household batteries) and over 10 years when using lithium batteries (required when Tempy sensors are deployed in sub-zero temperatures).</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>How can Tempy last for 10 years on batteries when most Wi-Fi sensors only last up to a few months?</strong><br/><br/><i>Although Tempy sensors use the 2.4GHz ISM band for wireless communication, they do not use the Wi-Fi communication protocol. Tempy uses a proprietary low-power wireless communication protocol which allows them to last for 10 years on batteries.</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Some Wi-Fi sensors claim 6-8 months of battery life. How is this possible?</strong><br/><br/><i>It is likely that these Wi-Fi sensors save power by transmitting data in one-hour intervals. This is much less (30x) than Tempie’s two-minute intervals.</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>What makes the Tempy sensor low-power?</strong><br/><br/><i>Tempy sensors send very small messages to the gateway. Because of this small message size, both the data transmission duration and power consumption requirements very low.</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>What is Tempy’s communication range?</strong><br/><br/><i>In optimal conditions, Tempy sensors have a wireless communication range of up to 4000 ft (1200 m) with the Tempy gateway. In less optimal conditions Tempy still has an impressive communication range that outperforms both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi.</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>What gives the Tempy its vast communication range?</strong><br/><br/><i>Tempy’s proprietary low-power wireless communication protocol that grants the Tempy sensors with such a long battery life is also what gives Tempy its' extensive communication range.</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Will Tempy sensors work in extreme temperatures?</strong><br/><br/><i>Yes. Tempy sensors have an operational temperature of between -40°F and 140°F (-40°C and 60°C). This makes Tempy ideal for monitoring fridges, freezers, and other perishable storage units. Please keep in mind that lithium batteries are required to power electronics with temperatures below 23°F (-5°C).</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Can Tempy sensors be used outdoors?</strong><br/><br/><i>Yes. The Tempy sensor is built for both indoor and outdoor use and is IP65 certified protecting it from dust ingress and low-pressure water jets.</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>How do Tempy sensors measure humidity through the IP65 certified casing?</strong><br/><br/><i>Tempy sensors have a Gore-Tex vent allowing for airflow to the internal humidity sensor, while at the same time stopping water from penetrating the casing.</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>What is the purpose of the Tempy gateway?</strong><br/><br/><i>Because Tempy sensors are not connected to the internet they need to “pass” all the data they’ve collected to an internet connected gateway, which in turn delivers it to the cloud.</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Are Tempy sensors paired with one specific gateway?</strong><br/><br/><i>No. Tempy sensors operate in the same way that a cell-phone communicates with cell towers. They will connect to any Tempy gateway that's within range and start transmitting data automatically with no configuration needed.</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Will I ever need more than one Tempy gateway?</strong><br/><br/><i>In a consumer setting, unlikely. In a business setting, maybe. The need for more than one gateway will arise when over one thousand Tempy sensors are being used within a single use-case (1 gateway per 1000 sensors), or you're wanting to extend Tempy's connectivity range.</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>What are the dimensions of the Tempy sensor and gateway?</strong><br/><br/><i>- Tempy sensor: 4 in. x 2 in. x 1.1 in. (10.3 cm x 5 cm x 3 cm)<br/>- Tempy gateway: 4.1 in. x 2.2 in. x 1 in. (10.4 cm x 5.5 cm x 2.5 cm)</i><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>How do you mount a Tempy sensor?</strong><br/><br/><i>Tempy sensors are lightweight and screw mountable. They can also be temporarily installed with the use of 3M (available at any hardware store) or Velcro tape (included).</i><br/> </li>
<li>

  Tempy Use-Cases: Are you wanting to monitor the heat distribution in your home, or own a secondary residence that's unattended for 6 months out of the year? With Tempy installed in your home or cabin, you can rest at ease knowing that your fridge and furnace are running, plants are growing, waterlines are intact, and pets are comfortable while you’re away.  With home and office monitoring being the Tempy systems' most popular methods of employment, there are dozens of additional use-cases in which Tempy can save on power, heating, and damage costs. Below are a few supplementary examples of what Tempy can be used for:  How Tempy Works: Tempy consists of sensors and gateways. Tempy sensors are an all-in-one, wireless sensing device that collects temperature, humidity, and air pressure data and “passes” it to a Tempy gateway. The Tempy gateway is a wired, internet connected device that receives the data collected by the Tempy sensors then sends it to the cloud. Once in the cloud, all Tempy sensor data can be accessed and visualized through our online web application. Tempy sensors have a communication range of up to 4000 ft (1200 m) with Tempy gateways in optimal conditions and will automatically start transmitting data once in range.  Tempy Sensors: Tempy sensors are an ultra-low-power sensing device that lasts for up to 10-years on two AA batteries (included) with readings being taken every two minutes. Adding sensors to an existing Tempy solution is quick, easy, and can happen at any time. There are no scalability limitations pertaining to the number of sensors you can add to a Tempy use-case. There are 2 types of Tempy sensors available:
Tempy: Senses temperature only
Tempy+:  Senses temperature, humidity, and air pressure
  Tempy Gateways: Tempy gateways are a wired, internet connected device that bridges the communication of Tempy sensors to the internet by delivering their collected data to the cloud. Tempy gateways can facilitate communication with up to 1000 Tempy sensors and have a connectivity range of up to 4000 ft (1200 m) in optimal conditions. In scenarios where there are more than 1000 Tempy sensors in use or you need additional coverage, you can add additional gateways to balance the connectivity and data loads. Adding gateways to an existing Tempy solution is quick, easy, and can happen at any time.  The Tempy Web App:  The Tempy web application is a cloud portal that allows you to access your Tempy data, register sensors, create custom alerts, and more. This online service is accessible through a web browser from anywhere in the world and is desktop, tablet, and mobile friendly.  Notable advantages include:

Maybe you're wondering how you can save up to 68%, or start thinking ""the usual trickery"" but if you keep on reading I will demonstrate that it is not like that. You can verify by yourself that the data that I give you is real. To do that, I have to show a cost analysis, but first, I want to explain which benefits you will have if you decide to contribute.</div><div style=""font-size: 13.001pt; line-height: 140%;"">

As you can see I did not upload any videos trying to assume the public. What I want to do instead is to make you understand how you can have such high savings and why your contribution is fundamental.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to buying goods or services, the word Internet is synonymous to savings, and it is true, because everything that you buy in a shop, you can find it easily on the internet for a cheaper price, but if you do a quick search as covers repairs of smartphones, tablets, etc .. you realize immediately that the prices are not much different as those of service centers scattered around the city. Then there are the Chinese who are now sprouting everywhere and as always do beneficial prices, but I do not recommend them, because the quality of the spare parts they use, it is often very poor (it happens daily to see the display with different background colors than the original or to see the display stopping working after a few months), often they do not offer any guarantee on the spare parts and often no receipt is issued !!!<br/>
<br/>
Now let's examine how much a replacement display is costing and how much you could save if you are going to make your contribution.<br/>
<br/>
If you go on any website as <a href=""https://3c.gmx.net/mail/client/dereferrer?redirectUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.toprepair.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-size: 13.001pt; line-height: 140%;"" target=""_blank"">www.toprepair.it</a> (I take this reference site because it explains prices  clearly and does not ask for a prepayment as on other sites, and I have nothing against, the service center I work for is adopting this price too) or on other similar sites the replacement of the entire display + touch screen for a Samsung S4 costs EUR 179.00 including pickup.<br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449481118/pp5wupxe6qmpd4mzckoh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
If you go to a service center it is not a big difference cause it is obvious that prices range of prices is almost the same.</div><div style=""font-size: 13.001pt; line-height: 140%;"">
<br/>
But let's see in detail what are the costs that a repairer must face. <b>Anyone can buy an already assembled display on <a href=""https://3c.gmx.net/mail/client/dereferrer?redirectUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-size: 13.001pt; line-height: 140%;"" target=""_blank"">www.ebay.it</a> for €. 75.00.</b><br/>
<br/>
A repairman or a service center, with its ""hooks"" and with a good turnover takes in EUR 50.00 (often less). In the case of online repairer must add shipping charges, one for withdrawal and one for the return that amount to about €. 15.00 and everything else is profit. Service centers do not have the shipping so the gain is even greater. So if you do well the accounts to remain well repairman €. 114.00, rising to €. 129.00 Operator offline. It is true that in Italy now the tax burden is around 60% and that the cost of running a business are high, but this does not justify such a lavish gain.</div><div style=""font-size: 13.001pt; line-height: 140%;""><br/></div><div style=""font-size: 13.001pt; line-height: 140%;"">

Let's see in detail how much it would cost if you decide to fund me. Keeping unchanged the costing and shipments €. 25,00 for each job performed. Yes, because 25 Euros represents the ""right"" gain (always €. 100.00 per hour) for a qualified technician. So let's sum up:<br/>
<br/><b>€. 50.00 (display) + €. 15.00 (shipments) + €. 25.00 (labor) = €. 90.00<br/>
<br/>
So it’s 50% less.</b><br/>
<br/><b>
I evaluated 25 parts</b> (you can do it too for your replacement) as the most frequent display Iphone 4, 5 and 6, the display Samsung S3, 4, 5 and 6, recharger (for any device), Huawei and G7 and P8 different Nokia Lumia, LG, etc ... and what comes out is that for any replacement we speak about, <b>there is a saving ranging from 33% to 68%</b>.

In a world that has turned to an exasperated consumer society, <b>a “broken” smartphone is often replaced with another</b>, <b>obviously, if you see the prohibitive costs of repair out of warranty</b>. But with a considerable saving on repairs, you can give a second life to your smartphone, and if you want to replace it with the last Galaxy S7 that still has to come out, you can do it anyway,<b> </b>as your dear old iPhone can be fixed and sold  to some acquaintance or on ebay.  You can recycle it in the family (mom, dad, girlfriend, brother, sister, grandparents, etc ...), often in exchange for something, or give it to whoever you want. 
</div><div style=""font-size: 13.001pt; line-height: 140%;"">Apart from this, in Italy, will open a new frontier, those repairs (quality) low cost, <b>so inevitably many in the industry will have to adapt </b>(and I speak not only operators but also online and offline) <b>resulting in low general prices. </b>Do you know how much Italians spend on repairs? It is estimated that only in the year 2014, in Italy, has been spent over 140 million euro (the number is still growing).

Objectives and Risks</h2>
<br/>
<br/>
The goal of this campaign is to launch a crowdfunding e-commerce site, <b>specialized in economical repairs for smartphones and tablets</b> and the promotion with Google Adwords campaigns, Facebook ads and also always on the portal, it will be able to buy spare parts and accessories. <span style=""font-size: 13.001pt; line-height: 140%; text-align: center; background-color: initial;"">We are going to create a new online store within eBay. </span>
</div><div style=""font-size: 13.001pt; line-height: 140%;"">
<span style=""font-size: 13.001pt; line-height: 140%; text-align: center; background-color: initial;""><b>The site will be accessible and operational with in 60 days.</b></span>
</div><div style=""font-size: 13.001pt; line-height: 140%; text-align: center;"">
The only risk if the goal is not reached, is that I will buy spare parts at higher prices, which results in a slightly higher final price. Whatever business you speak about, make a single purchase is not the same thing as buying maybe 20 to 30 or 50 items. It is obvious that for multiple purchases supplier applies a different discount, allowing to get the maximum savings.<br/>

Conclusion</h2>

<br/>
We are in Italy, the crisis unfortunately forced everyone to make sacrifices and saving has become for many the only way to move forward. I want to give my contribution, but without yours, all my efforts will be unnecessary and if you understand,<b> it does not cost you anything.</b> The coupon can be used whenever you want and like to buy what you need. And additionally you will get fantastic prese.<br/>

<div>Mi chiamo Francesco Gagliano, ho 35 anni, sono un tecnico e lavoro presso un negozio di telefonia/centro assistenza, riparo dispositivi mobili ormai da 6 anni.</div><div>Lei è la mia ragazza e mi accompagna in tutto ciò che faccio.</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""> Magari ti starai chiedendo come è possibile risparmiare sino al 68%  oppure inizi a pensare ""la solita buffala"" ma  se continuerai  a leggere ti dimostrerò che non è così, tu stesso puoi verificare che i dati che ti darò sono reali. Per fare ciò devo mostrarti un'analisi dei costi, ma prima, voglio spiegarti <b>quali benefici avrai se decidi di contribuire.</b></span></div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<b>La tua non è una donazione a fondo perduto ma un coupon </b>che potrai utilizzare  all'interno del sito per la riparazione del tuo dispositivo nonché per l'acquisto di accessori (cover, pellicole, vetri,auricolari,dispositivi di ricarica rapida. Cuffie,ecc.)</li>
<li>
<b>Avrai in omaggio diversi accessori </b>che ti saranno recapitati direttamente a casa senza ulteriori spese. </li>
<li>
<b>Aquisirai un extra sconto</b> per le vostre future riparazioni e/o acquisti.</li>
</ul></div> <p><br/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Come vedi non ho caricato nessun video cercando di ipotizzare il pubblico, quello che voglio fare invece è farti capire come sia possibile avere un risparmio così alto e perché il tuo contributo è  fondamentale.</p>
<p>Quando si tratta di acquistare beni o servizi,  la parola internet è sinonimo di risparmio, ed è vero, perché tutto quello che tu acquisti in un normale negozio, lo trovi facilmente su internet ad un prezzo minore,  ma se fate una rapida ricerca per quanto riguarda le riparazioni di smartphone, tablet, ecc.. vi accorgete subito che i prezzi non sono tanto differenti dei centri assistenza sparsi per la città. Poi ci sono i cinesi che ormai spuntano dappertutto e come sempre fanno dei prezzi vantaggiosi, ma io sconsiglio sempre  di recarsi da loro,  in quanto, la qualità dei pezzi di ricambio che utilizzano, spesso  è veramente scadente (mi capita giornalmente di vedere display con i colori di sfondo diversi dall'originale o vedere display che smettono di funzionare dopo solo qualche mese), spesso non offrono nessuna garanzia sul pezzo di ricambio e altrettanto spesso non rilasciano nessuna ricevuta!!!</p>
<p>Adesso esaminiamo quando vi costa un ricambio display e quando potreste risparmiare  se decidete di finanziarmi.</p>
<p>Se andate su un qualsiasi sito come <a href=""http://www.toprepair.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.toprepair.it</a> (prendo questo sito di riferimento in quanto mette i prezzi in chiaro e non chiede come  in altri siti un preventivo e non ho nulla contro, anche il centro assistenza per cui lavoro adotta questo prezzo) o altri siti simili, il ricambio dell'intero display+touch screen per un samsung s4  costa €.179.00 compreso ritiro e riconsegna. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448901720/qb0cjdtbwyfnc6urocbk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Se andate in un centro assistenza la cosa non cambia molto, è ovvio che i prezzi oscillano di qualche decina di euro, ma la media è quella.</p>
<p>Ma andiamo a vedere nel dettaglio quali sono i costi che un riparatore deve affrontare. <b> Un display gia assemblato chiunque può acquistarlo su <a href=""http://www.ebay.it"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ebay.it</a> a € 75.00.</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Un riparatore o un centro assistenza,  con i suoi ""agganci"" e con un buon giro d'affari lo prende a €. 50.00  (spesso anche meno).  Nel caso del riparatore online deve aggiungere le spese di spedizione, una per il ritiro e una per la riconsegna che ammontano a circa €.15.00 e tutto il resto è guadagno. I centri assistenza  non non hanno le spese di spedizione quindi il guadagno è ancora maggiore. Quindi se fate bene i conti al riparatore rimango ben €. 114.00, che salgono a €.129.00 per l'operatore offline. Si è vero che in Italia ormai la pressione fiscale si aggira intorno al 60% e che le spese per la gestione di un'attività sono alte, <b>ma tutto ciò non giustifica un così lauto guadagno.</b></span></p>
<p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<h2>""Cambiare la politica dei prezzi e far risparmiare gli utenti""</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Questo è lo scopo di questa campagna crowfunding e tu sarai il primo a beneficiarne.  Andiamo a vedere nel dettaglio quanto ti costerebbe lo stesso ricambio se deciderai di finanziarmi. Mantenendo immutato il prezzo di costo e le spedizioni, aggiungete €. 25.00 per ogni lavoro effettuato. Si, perché 25 euro, rappresentano il ""giusto"" guadagno  (sono sempre €. 100.00 l'ora) per un tecnico qualificato. Quindi andiamo a sommare:</p>
<p><b>€. 50.00 (display)+ €.15.00 (spedizioni)+ €.25.00 (manodopera) = €.90.00</b></p>
<p><b>Ovvero il 50% in meno.</b></p>
<p><b>Ho valutato 25 ricambi</b> (puoi farlo anche tu per il tuo ricambio) fra i più frequenti come display iphone 4, 5 e 6, display samsung s3, 4, 5 e 6, connettore ricarca (per qualsiasi dispositivo),huawei g7 e p8 e diversi nokia lumia,lg, ecc...  e quello che ne esce fuori è che di qualsiasi ricambio si parla, <b>si ha un risparmio che varia dal 33% al 68%. </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Ho analizzato il samsung s4 in quanto rappresenta la media ed è questo il prezzo che troverai all'interno del sito.</span></p>

Oltre a questo, in Italia, si aprirà una nuova frontiera, quelle delle riparazioni (di qualità) low cost, per cui, <b>nevitabilmente molti operatori del settore dovranno adeguarsi </b>(e non parlo solo degli operatori online ma anche di quelli offline) <b>con conseguente abbasso generale dei prezzi.</b></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Sai quanto spendono gli italiani  per le riparazioni?  È stato calcolato che nel solo 2014, in Italia, sono stati spesi oltre 140 milioni di euro (in continua crescita), quindi,  prova ad immaginare quanto denaro può rimanere nelle tasche dei consumatori.</span>

"" Do you know that you can save 33% to 68% on repairs? ""

My name is Francesco Gagliano. I am 36 years old. I have been working as an engineer at a phone store/customer support center and I repair mobile devices for 6 years now.She is my girlfriend and accompanies me in everything I do.

Maybe you're wondering how you can save up to 68%, or start thinking ""the usual trickery"" but if you keep on reading I will demonstrate that it is not like that. You can verify by yourself that the data that I give you is real. To do that, I have to show a cost analysis, but first, I want to explain which benefits you will have if you decide to contribute.


Your donation is not a vain grant but a coupon that you can use on the site to repair your devices and buy equipments (covers, screen protestors, power banks , headphones, etc.)


You will get several accessories for free that will be delivered at your home without additional charge.


For your future repairs and/or purchases you will receive extra discounts.




As you can see I did not upload any videos trying to assume the public. What I want to do instead is to make you understand how you can have such high savings and why your contribution is fundamental.

When it comes to buying goods or services, the word Internet is synonymous to savings, and it is true, because everything that you buy in a shop, you can find it easily on the internet for a cheaper price, but if you do a quick search as covers repairs of smartphones, tablets, etc .. you realize immediately that the prices are not much different as those of service centers scattered around the city. Then there are the Chinese who are now sprouting everywhere and as always do beneficial prices, but I do not recommend them, because the quality of the spare parts they use, it is often very poor (it happens daily to see the display with different background colors than the original or to see the display stopping working after a few months), often they do not offer any guarantee on the spare parts and often no receipt is issued !!!

Now let's examine how much a replacement display is costing and how much you could save if you are going to make your contribution.

If you go on any website as www.toprepair.it (I take this reference site because it explains prices  clearly and does not ask for a prepayment as on other sites, and I have nothing against, the service center I work for is adopting this price too) or on other similar sites the replacement of the entire display + touch screen for a Samsung S4 costs EUR 179.00 including pickup.


If you go to a service center it is not a big difference cause it is obvious that prices range of prices is almost the same.

But let's see in detail what are the costs that a repairer must face. Anyone can buy an already assembled display on www.ebay.it for €. 75.00.

A repairman or a service center, with its ""hooks"" and with a good turnover takes in EUR 50.00 (often less). In the case of online repairer must add shipping charges, one for withdrawal and one for the return that amount to about €. 15.00 and everything else is profit. Service centers do not have the shipping so the gain is even greater. So if you do well the accounts to remain well repairman €. 114.00, rising to €. 129.00 Operator offline. It is true that in Italy now the tax burden is around 60% and that the cost of running a business are high, but this does not justify such a lavish gain.


""Change the price policy and let users save money""

This is the purpose of this crowfunding campaign and you'll be the first to benefit. Let's see in detail how much it would cost if you decide to fund me. Keeping unchanged the costing and shipments €. 25,00 for each job performed. Yes, because 25 Euros represents the ""right"" gain (always €. 100.00 per hour) for a qualified technician. So let's sum up:
€. 50.00 (display) + €. 15.00 (shipments) + €. 25.00 (labor) = €. 90.00

So it’s 50% less.

I evaluated 25 parts (you can do it too for your replacement) as the most frequent display Iphone 4, 5 and 6, the display Samsung S3, 4, 5 and 6, recharger (for any device), Huawei and G7 and P8 different Nokia Lumia, LG, etc ... and what comes out is that for any replacement we speak about, there is a saving ranging from 33% to 68%. I analyzed the Samsung S4 as it represents the average and this is the price that you will find on the site.

Your contribution is valuable - not only for me or for you, but for everyone !!!


In a world that has turned to an exasperated consumer society, a “broken” smartphone is often replaced with another, obviously, if you see the prohibitive costs of repair out of warranty. But with a considerable saving on repairs, you can give a second life to your smartphone, and if you want to replace it with the last Galaxy S7 that still has to come out, you can do it anyway, as your dear old iPhone can be fixed and sold  to some acquaintance or on ebay.  You can recycle it in the family (mom, dad, girlfriend, brother, sister, grandparents, etc ...), often in exchange for something, or give it to whoever you want. 
Apart from this, in Italy, will open a new frontier, those repairs (quality) low cost, so inevitably many in the industry will have to adapt (and I speak not only operators but also online and offline) resulting in low general prices. Do you know how much Italians spend on repairs? It is estimated that only in the year 2014, in Italy, has been spent over 140 million euro (the number is still growing). Try to imagine how much money can remain in the pockets of consumers.


How can this money be used?


In addition to the expenses required for the construction of site, purchase domain, opening a VAT, registration chamber of commerce, etc. (€. 1000/2000), the rest will be used solely and exclusively for the purchase of spare parts, in this way, you can ""check"" advantageous prices which results in greater savings for you.

Objectives and Risks


The goal of this campaign is to launch a crowdfunding e-commerce site, specialized in economical repairs for smartphones and tablets and the promotion with Google Adwords campaigns, Facebook ads and also always on the portal, it will be able to buy spare parts and accessories. We are going to create a new online store within eBay. 

The site will be accessible and operational with in 60 days.

The only risk if the goal is not reached, is that I will buy spare parts at higher prices, which results in a slightly higher final price. Whatever business you speak about, make a single purchase is not the same thing as buying maybe 20 to 30 or 50 items. It is obvious that for multiple purchases supplier applies a different discount, allowing to get the maximum savings.

Conclusion


We are in Italy, the crisis unfortunately forced everyone to make sacrifices and saving has become for many the only way to move forward. I want to give my contribution, but without yours, all my efforts will be unnecessary and if you understand, it does not cost you anything. The coupon can be used whenever you want and like to buy what you need. And additionally you will get fantastic prese.
If you came up here I can only thank you for your interest, and if you decide to contribute, I will thank you publicly as soon as the site is ready, so a big thanks and see you soon.//////////////////////////////////////////Versione italiana//////////////////////////////////////////
""Sai che puoi risparmiare dal 33% al 68% sulle riparazioni ma nessuno lo dice?""
Mi chiamo Francesco Gagliano, ho 35 anni, sono un tecnico e lavoro presso un negozio di telefonia/centro assistenza, riparo dispositivi mobili ormai da 6 anni.Lei è la mia ragazza e mi accompagna in tutto ciò che faccio.
 Magari ti starai chiedendo come è possibile risparmiare sino al 68%  oppure inizi a pensare ""la solita buffala"" ma  se continuerai  a leggere ti dimostrerò che non è così, tu stesso puoi verificare che i dati che ti darò sono reali. Per fare ciò devo mostrarti un'analisi dei costi, ma prima, voglio spiegarti quali benefici avrai se decidi di contribuire.


La tua non è una donazione a fondo perduto ma un coupon che potrai utilizzare  all'interno del sito per la riparazione del tuo dispositivo nonché per l'acquisto di accessori (cover, pellicole, vetri,auricolari,dispositivi di ricarica rapida. Cuffie,ecc.)

Avrai in omaggio diversi accessori che ti saranno recapitati direttamente a casa senza ulteriori spese. 

Aquisirai un extra sconto per le vostre future riparazioni e/o acquisti.
 
 
Come vedi non ho caricato nessun video cercando di ipotizzare il pubblico, quello che voglio fare invece è farti capire come sia possibile avere un risparmio così alto e perché il tuo contributo è  fondamentale.
Quando si tratta di acquistare beni o servizi,  la parola internet è sinonimo di risparmio, ed è vero, perché tutto quello che tu acquisti in un normale negozio, lo trovi facilmente su internet ad un prezzo minore,  ma se fate una rapida ricerca per quanto riguarda le riparazioni di smartphone, tablet, ecc.. vi accorgete subito che i prezzi non sono tanto differenti dei centri assistenza sparsi per la città. Poi ci sono i cinesi che ormai spuntano dappertutto e come sempre fanno dei prezzi vantaggiosi, ma io sconsiglio sempre  di recarsi da loro,  in quanto, la qualità dei pezzi di ricambio che utilizzano, spesso  è veramente scadente (mi capita giornalmente di vedere display con i colori di sfondo diversi dall'originale o vedere display che smettono di funzionare dopo solo qualche mese), spesso non offrono nessuna garanzia sul pezzo di ricambio e altrettanto spesso non rilasciano nessuna ricevuta!!!
Adesso esaminiamo quando vi costa un ricambio display e quando potreste risparmiare  se decidete di finanziarmi.
Se andate su un qualsiasi sito come www.toprepair.it (prendo questo sito di riferimento in quanto mette i prezzi in chiaro e non chiede come  in altri siti un preventivo e non ho nulla contro, anche il centro assistenza per cui lavoro adotta questo prezzo) o altri siti simili, il ricambio dell'intero display+touch screen per un samsung s4  costa €.179.00 compreso ritiro e riconsegna. 

Se andate in un centro assistenza la cosa non cambia molto, è ovvio che i prezzi oscillano di qualche decina di euro, ma la media è quella.
Ma andiamo a vedere nel dettaglio quali sono i costi che un riparatore deve affrontare.  Un display gia assemblato chiunque può acquistarlo su www.ebay.it a € 75.00.
 Un riparatore o un centro assistenza,  con i suoi ""agganci"" e con un buon giro d'affari lo prende a €. 50.00  (spesso anche meno).  Nel caso del riparatore online deve aggiungere le spese di spedizione, una per il ritiro e una per la riconsegna che ammontano a circa €.15.00 e tutto il resto è guadagno. I centri assistenza  non non hanno le spese di spedizione quindi il guadagno è ancora maggiore. Quindi se fate bene i conti al riparatore rimango ben €. 114.00, che salgono a €.129.00 per l'operatore offline. Si è vero che in Italia ormai la pressione fiscale si aggira intorno al 60% e che le spese per la gestione di un'attività sono alte, ma tutto ciò non giustifica un così lauto guadagno.

""Cambiare la politica dei prezzi e far risparmiare gli utenti""

Questo è lo scopo di questa campagna crowfunding e tu sarai il primo a beneficiarne.  Andiamo a vedere nel dettaglio quanto ti costerebbe lo stesso ricambio se deciderai di finanziarmi. Mantenendo immutato il prezzo di costo e le spedizioni, aggiungete €. 25.00 per ogni lavoro effettuato. Si, perché 25 euro, rappresentano il ""giusto"" guadagno  (sono sempre €. 100.00 l'ora) per un tecnico qualificato. Quindi andiamo a sommare:
€. 50.00 (display)+ €.15.00 (spedizioni)+ €.25.00 (manodopera) = €.90.00
Ovvero il 50% in meno.
Ho valutato 25 ricambi (puoi farlo anche tu per il tuo ricambio) fra i più frequenti come display iphone 4, 5 e 6, display samsung s3, 4, 5 e 6, connettore ricarca (per qualsiasi dispositivo),huawei g7 e p8 e diversi nokia lumia,lg, ecc...  e quello che ne esce fuori è che di qualsiasi ricambio si parla, si ha un risparmio che varia dal 33% al 68%. Ho analizzato il samsung s4 in quanto rappresenta la media ed è questo il prezzo che troverai all'interno del sito.

Il tuo contributo è prezioso non solo per me o per te, ma per tutti!!!


In un mondo che il cunsumismo ha raggiunto livelli esasperati, lo smartphone ""rotto"" spesso viene sostituito con un altro, naturale visto i proibitivi costi di riparazione fuori garanzia. Ma, con un notevole risparmio sulle riparazioni, si può dare una seconda vita al proprio smartphone, e se  vuoi sostituirlo con l'ultimo galaxi s7 che ancora deve uscire, puoi farlo comunque, mentre il tuo caro vecchio iphone puoi ripararlo e venderlo a qualche conoscente o su ebay, puoi riciclarlo in famiglia (mamma, papà, fidanzata, fratello, sorella, nonni,ecc...),spesso in cambio di qualcosa, oppure regalarlo a chi ti pare. Oltre a questo, in Italia, si aprirà una nuova frontiera, quelle delle riparazioni (di qualità) low cost, per cui, nevitabilmente molti operatori del settore dovranno adeguarsi (e non parlo solo degli operatori online ma anche di quelli offline) con conseguente abbasso generale dei prezzi. Sai quanto spendono gli italiani  per le riparazioni?  È stato calcolato che nel solo 2014, in Italia, sono stati spesi oltre 140 milioni di euro (in continua crescita), quindi,  prova ad immaginare quanto denaro può rimanere nelle tasche dei consumatori.


Come verrà impiegato questo denaro?

Oltre alla spese richieste  per la realizzazione del sito, acquisto dominio, apertura partita iva, iscrizione camera di commercio, ecc. (€.1000/2000), tutto il resto servirà solo ed esclusivamente all'acquisto di pezzi di ricambio, in questo modo, si possono ""spuntare""  prezzi vantaggiosi il che si traduce in un maggiore risparmio per te.

Obbiettivi e Rischi 

L'obbiettivo di questa campagna di crowdfunding è lanciare un sito e-commerce  specializzato nelle riparazioni a basso costo per smartphone e tablet, promuoverlo  con campagne di google adwords e facebook ads, inoltre,  sempre all'interno del portale, sarà possibile acquistare ricambi e accessori. Creare un nuovo negozio online all'interno di ebay. 
Il sito sarà raggiungibile e operativo entro 60 gg.
L'unico rischio se non si raggiunge il goal è che non avendo un budget importante, acquisterò ricambi a prezzi più alti, il che si traduce in un prezzo finale lievemente maggiore. Di qualsiasi buisness si parli, fare un singolo acquisto non è la stessa cosa che acquistare magari 20-30 o 50 articoli. È ovvio che per acquisti multipli il fornitore applica una scontistica diversa, permettendo così di avere il massimo risparmio. 


Conclusione 

Siamo in Italia, la crisi purtroppo  costringe a tutti fare dei sacrifici e risparmiare è diventata per molti l'unica soluzione per andare avanti, io voglio dare il mio contributo, ma senza il tuo, tutti I miei sforzi non serviranno a nulla, e se hai ben capito , non ti costa proprio nulla, il coupon potrai utilizzarlo quando ti pare e piace per acquistare ciò che ti serve, in più riceverai dei fantastici gudget. Se sei arrivato sino qui non posso che ringraziarti per l'interesse mostrato, e nel caso che decidi anche tu di contribuire, ti ringrazierò pubblicamente non appena il sito sarà pronto.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Dominoes is a family of games played with rectangular ""domino"" tiles. We've all seen those amazing displays of a multitude of dominoes toppling over one by one.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this project, we decided to assign a unique ability to our lamps to make them interact like dominoes. So we defined a feature named ""Domi"" and finally we made it. That's exactly why the lamp is called DomiLamp.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/984/605/a264adc4cb2f8d669b784974193b0b59_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1503153559&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=66861a77fe5d79775394adac5d106c9e"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>With ""Domi"" enabled, when two or more lamps are within a certain distance(about 13ft/4m), a light change of one lamp could be easily transmitted to others around it. Then, those lamps which received the change would adjust their light color and intensity to match the first lamp's. This effect would then spread from those lamps to outer lamps if existed.</p>
<p>The amazing thing is that ""Domi"" could work <strong>with any number of DomiLamps, without any configurations</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Check out the animation showing how ""Domi"" works:</p>

<p>The rotary dimmer is a classic design in industry. It provides an excellent user experience. We learned from it and made DomiLamp's shade as a bigger dimmer. When you need to change the light, all you need to do is to rotate. Additionally, we inventively added <strong>vibration feedback</strong>. Thus you could get a reminder when you reach the maximum level of the light intensity.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why didn't we provide the full-color support?</strong></p>
<p>As shown above, DomiLamps don't have the full-color support, which is different from other smart lamps in the market. Intellisn insists to give consumers the simplest experience. Think about it, how often will you make the light turn red, green or blue for the room? 90% of our respondents in the design phase said they would never use it at all. So, we did the subtraction.</p>

<p>Cocktail. We borrowed this word from the pub. It is popular because of its unique look by mixing two or more ingredients without breaking the border of each layer. For our Cocktail - 1 light, we mix the orange light and the warm white light. Mysterious and peaceful.</p>

<p>Being different from Cocktail - 1, Cocktail - 2 replaces the candle orange light with the bright white light. It gives you an intermediate color between the warm and cool white lights. This is for the time when you want a brighter lighting effect but don't want to see a pure white light around.</p>

<p>As told in the name, Cool light provides you with a bright and cold feeling. It is suitable for readings and simple lighting. In this mode, the DomiLamp glows like a traditional fluorescent lamp illuminating the place you want to light up.</p>

<p>There are many integrated high-power LED chips in the market. We could reduce the LED amount to significantly save the cost by using these chips if we only cared about the brightness. But in this case, the light would be very concentrated. When it goes through the lampshade and arrives in our eyes, we would feel it too glaring. So, here comes our solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make light glow from more angles with a leading industrial design;</li>
<li>Use more LED chips to increase the glowing area for each angle;</li>
<li>Add optical diffusing materials during the process of lampshade injection.</li>
</ul>

<p>It was a big challenge for us to find a solution of heat sinking without taking up too much space. After many attempts, we came out with this innovative design as shown below: an aluminum pillar with integrated heat sink inside. The pillar is made of a complete metallic material to ensure effective thermal conductivity. The heat is then dissipated through the holes drilled on the lampshade cap.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507622706/xdrugrcmzjx3hkhtdasm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why is heat sinking important for LEDs?</strong></p>
<p>LEDs are also often considered ""cool"" because they generate light through a mechanism other than thermal excitation of a substance, such as the tungsten filament in an incandescent lamp. Although LED lighting systems do not produce significant amounts of radiated heat, LEDs still generate heat within the junction, which must be dissipated by convection and conduction. Extracting heat from the lamp using heat sinks and by operating LEDs in lower ambient temperatures enables higher light output and longer life of the device.</p>

</div></div>","It is a lamp with simple look and feel.

It is a wooden lamp that is made of the most natural materials.

It is a convenient lamp that allows you to control it by simply rotating it.

It is a charming lamp that can be a flickering candle for romance, a soft and warm light for all kinds of lifestyle, or just bright for your work and study.

It is a smart lamp with unique ability to interact with peers within a certain distance.

Please allow us to introduce:
 

 
 


 

 
 


 
Dominoes is a family of games played with rectangular ""domino"" tiles. We've all seen those amazing displays of a multitude of dominoes toppling over one by one.
At the beginning of this project, we decided to assign a unique ability to our lamps to make them interact like dominoes. So we defined a feature named ""Domi"" and finally we made it. That's exactly why the lamp is called DomiLamp.
 

 
With ""Domi"" enabled, when two or more lamps are within a certain distance(about 13ft/4m), a light change of one lamp could be easily transmitted to others around it. Then, those lamps which received the change would adjust their light color and intensity to match the first lamp's. This effect would then spread from those lamps to outer lamps if existed.
The amazing thing is that ""Domi"" could work with any number of DomiLamps, without any configurations.
 
Check out the animation showing how ""Domi"" works:

 
 

 
 

Handheld Design | Take it anywhere
 

Candles | More than flickering. You've known something called ""Domi"".
 

Light Show | See the chapter ""LIGHT COLORS"" for details
 

Bottom View | Don't try to remove the rubber pads. There's no screw underneath.
 

Solid Wood Bases | There's no more natural material than wood.
 


 
 


 
The rotary dimmer is a classic design in industry. It provides an excellent user experience. We learned from it and made DomiLamp's shade as a bigger dimmer. When you need to change the light, all you need to do is to rotate. Additionally, we inventively added vibration feedback. Thus you could get a reminder when you reach the maximum level of the light intensity.
 

360 Degree / Bi-directional Rotation w/ Vibration Feedback
 

 

 
 


 

Light Colors
 
Why didn't we provide the full-color support?
As shown above, DomiLamps don't have the full-color support, which is different from other smart lamps in the market. Intellisn insists to give consumers the simplest experience. Think about it, how often will you make the light turn red, green or blue for the room? 90% of our respondents in the design phase said they would never use it at all. So, we did the subtraction.
 

 

Some special algorithms are applied to ensure that every transition between the continuous or discontinuous steps will keep smooth.
 

 

Candle light imitates the real candle fire which is not stable and flickering all the time. This is very suitable for setting up your romantic atmosphere.
 

Cocktail. We borrowed this word from the pub. It is popular because of its unique look by mixing two or more ingredients without breaking the border of each layer. For our Cocktail - 1 light, we mix the orange light and the warm white light. Mysterious and peaceful.
 

Warm light gives you the soft and warm feeling like the sunshine of spring morning. It could be treated as the main color of all your lights. It shall exist all over the house, decorating every room as a real warm place you would love to stay.
 

Being different from Cocktail - 1, Cocktail - 2 replaces the candle orange light with the bright white light. It gives you an intermediate color between the warm and cool white lights. This is for the time when you want a brighter lighting effect but don't want to see a pure white light around.
 

As told in the name, Cool light provides you with a bright and cold feeling. It is suitable for readings and simple lighting. In this mode, the DomiLamp glows like a traditional fluorescent lamp illuminating the place you want to light up.
 

 
There are many integrated high-power LED chips in the market. We could reduce the LED amount to significantly save the cost by using these chips if we only cared about the brightness. But in this case, the light would be very concentrated. When it goes through the lampshade and arrives in our eyes, we would feel it too glaring. So, here comes our solution:

Make light glow from more angles with a leading industrial design;
Use more LED chips to increase the glowing area for each angle;
Add optical diffusing materials during the process of lampshade injection.

 

 

 
It was a big challenge for us to find a solution of heat sinking without taking up too much space. After many attempts, we came out with this innovative design as shown below: an aluminum pillar with integrated heat sink inside. The pillar is made of a complete metallic material to ensure effective thermal conductivity. The heat is then dissipated through the holes drilled on the lampshade cap. 

Why is heat sinking important for LEDs?
LEDs are also often considered ""cool"" because they generate light through a mechanism other than thermal excitation of a substance, such as the tungsten filament in an incandescent lamp. Although LED lighting systems do not produce significant amounts of radiated heat, LEDs still generate heat within the junction, which must be dissipated by convection and conduction. Extracting heat from the lamp using heat sinks and by operating LEDs in lower ambient temperatures enables higher light output and longer life of the device.

</div></div>","Meet WallaceInstalling shelving and storage in your space can be more hassle than it’s worth. SWENYO decided to design a better shelf to fit your lifestyle. Unlike most shelves on the market, Wallace is easy to install, multi-functional, and extremely durable. With functional accessories like clips, cups, chargers and more, Wallace is so much more than a shelf, it's a solution.
Wallace in the Press


Installing Wallace








  POSITION the aluminum mount on the wall.
  HAMMER the included nails through the holes at the top of the aluminum mount, starting at the center. Tap either end of mount to level.
  SLIDE the plywood french cleat over the mount and hook shelves and small accessories into the french cleat’s center slot. That was easy!




Wallace Anywhere






Each kit is designed with a specific room in mind, like charging your phone in your bedroom. However, it’s up to you where Wallace lives as each kit is modular and can easily adapt to different environments.

I hope you are doing well ? Please let me start by saying that there is no multi million £ marketing campaign that goes with this.   I wanted to let you know that I am launching this campaign on Indiegogo. The campaign is to start my personal business where I make luxury lamps that will suit anyone's moods. You can alternate the colour and ambience of your home easily with them. Indiegogo and crowd funding are in essence grass roots of financing by nature and I hope you will help support me in launching my first business. You can also contact me personally and we can talk more. I look forward to hearing from you! (skype simon.watson71)<div>
<br/><p>Dear All Readers, Firstly I really appreciate you taking the time to look at this ""Indiegogo"" request for funding on my idea. I would like to give you a brief outline of how this idea came about and my circumstances so you understand why I need help to get this project off the ground. Firstly like many people in the world I attended secondary school and gained my GCSE's followed by my A'levels where I studied art and design. Sometimes like all people we drift between employment, enjoying life in my formative years and having fun but sometimes life can be a little cruel. Turning back the clock I had a fall in the garden when i was 27 that left me in hospital for many months a result of blood clots and this left me disabled. Going from a lively energetic young man to being disabled gave me time to reflect upon many things in life and look at what I did know. Not one to feel aggrieved by my circumstances I tried my best to live life with a new direction, as we know it is very difficult for a disabled person to gain employment so I reverted back to my days studying when an idea stuck in My mind. Whilst watching the sunset filter into my small apartment, i thought about the beauty of the sun sending shades of light cascading around my room and then is when my idea was born. If we could replicate the sun in a small form table lamp this would bring the same calming,soothing sensation it brought to myself in my world of disability. So I studied designs and came up with my adjustable shade table lamp. To get this started I obviously , Having very little funds drew what portion I could and contacted a local company who fabricated a sample for me at a cost of £1760, The effects were perfect to that sun cascading that I envisaged. So I went about Patent pending and trying to spread the word on my idea through my website that is now Google ranked No 1 for ""stylish lamps"" globally. This idea then became a dream, Could I through my education change my circumstance, who could I meet who will believe in me enough to get this product into manufacture and bring the same warmth to adults and childrens rooms alike, Around the world. Obviously having huge amounts of time on my hands I looked at networking, who I could meet and although i have no idea of the magnitude of a worldwide industry I believe someone somewhere will benefit always by having the same serenity i felt when exploring this idea. Once my website was  finished I continued with ideas and now I am at a stage where I want to be able to manufacture this item and see others benefit from the same serenity felt by myself. To start a production and make this item an affordable product to grace every ones homes first a manufacturer must create a BOM (bill of materials) and tooling. The tooling portion is very expensive and why I am seeking through this site to gain funds from wonderful people around the world who I do not wish to feel sorry for me but sympathy and maybe empathy in some respect  towards my situation. Your donation may mean that I can not only fullfill my dream to bring the same relaxing calmness to others through LIGHT but also that I can continue to develop items and change my own circumstances.</p>
<p>The tooling is the major portion of cost and with the networking I have undertaken I have now dialogue with some very clever business people who have understood my situation and are willing to aid in manufacture. Once I reach the magical figure it will be sent for immediate tooling and I can then take a moment to relax and try to gain greater inspiration from the sun filtering into my room. Once the initial idea is tooled then I can start to discuss with the people I have met to add new portions such as more LED versions. I hope we can get this off the ground and others can feel the same relaxing sensation the sun brings to my world. Thanks Simon.</p>

</ul>
<p>I attended Denstone College where i took seven G.C.S.E's and an A'level in art and design. It was from my designing interest that i brought this idea to fruition.</p>
<p>Although my employment back ground does not really contribute to the concept of this table lamp i guess you could assume from it that i work best when left to my own devices.

After several expensive and very poor quality samples i finally settled upon a great company who have agreed to make it and even sell some for me themselves, for a commission of course.</p>
<p>I just feel that this lamp will benefit all of its users as you can simply and effectively angle the light to wherever it is wished and there is the added feature of the colour changing aspect by adding or removing the transparent coloured slides that slip easily down grooves on each side of each ""side"".

</h3> *Please check gallery for better pictures and more information!<br/><br/>Here it is boys! Finally a high end kit. Need a summer amp that isn't a heater? Been looking for something a little more efficient than class A, but not snoozing you like some class D? <br/><br/>I knew the amp was wonderful with things you can't get at it's price, that I've heard, anywhere... Then I spent almost the last year testing and developing a full born kit. The only expense spared is the lack of Teflon input capacitors! Honestly, I simply decided to go with the best sounding parts within reason. I've done a lot of listening with different input caps, many different variations on the <a href=""http://www.startfetch.com/keantoken/content/Kmultiplier.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kmultiplier</a>, and gone through multiple transformers. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here it is, I need to sell 44 kits to break even to order the parts for 100 kits.. Without achieving that goal I simply can't offer kits at a reasonable price (I can't get a big enough discount on buying parts for 10 kits)<br/></p> <ul> <li>Each kit costs $200 Shipped Priority USPS, so only donate in multiples of $200 for how many kits you want! (Contact me if you're not in the USA, I can adjust for shipping)<br/>
</li> <li>I'm suppose to tell you about the perks... How about an R&amp;D'd kit! It's Not your average willy-nilly mess of ground problem ridden DIY board. <br/>
</li> <li>The DIY<a href=""http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCoQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fdatasheet.octopart.com%2FTDA7297-STMicroelectronics-datasheet-10837159.pdf&amp;ei=vB5KVavkAdXsoATNioBI&amp;usg=AFQjCNHFZVUhgt11qZz-iETVRdqG7tZVAw&amp;sig2=8i0ut7C4OUgu3vJsetExeA&amp;bvm=bv.92291466,d.cGU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">7297</a> board and Antipole PSU come with every part you need. But you also get a transformer that has been selected for it's quality in multiple areas such as regulation, RF, and ease of use (Hammond 185 series). These parts are <i>very nice</i>. And luckily there's not too many so the cost doesn't become such a burden to afford the good stuff!<br/>
</li>
<li>I do recommend 91db efficient or better speakers for the best performance, but at 87db it's quite enjoyable <br/>
</li>
<li>*Information will be included on how to raise the operating voltage but it'll be done at the expensive of not knowing how long the chip will last. *Resistors for this not included.</li>
<li>
<br/><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Some Details on Parts:<br/>The amplifier features Panasonic SEPF 330uf 25v OSCON power capacitors (12x), Rifa (now Kemet) PHE450 input capacitors (selected over many others including Orange Drops and Wima), and a special <a href=""http://www.startfetch.com/keantoken/content/Kmultiplier.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kmultiplier</a> that provides voltage regulation with a TL431 and two transistors; including a heatsink for the power transistor that can be mounted vertical/horizontal.<br/><br/>The PSU features Coilcrafts combination Common Mode &amp; Differential choke filter that combined with EPCOS's naked MKT Silver capacitors greatly increase the filtration of RF on low inductance copper pour planes right at the rectifiers (MSR860). The large capacitors are the CK version of the Nichicon KG series, the best they make, and chosen for their transparent lack of sound that capacitors such as Panasonic FC/FM simply cannot touch in any configuration. This in combination with the benefits of a dual bobbin transformer (Hammond 185) makes for a low noise, very nice power supply. <br/><br/>The PCB boards are also quite nice, each one featuring orientation for the capacitors to have canceling fields, free of ground problems (star ground for for amp board connections, then to a copper pour), and very low inductance because of the copper pours. *Copper pours simply means that instead of a trace that's the size of a wire running, it's a plane of copper that extends as far as possible under and around all the vias (holes) that it can. It greatly reduces inductance created in tracings so that every piece that acts as a filter or path for noise will perform better, giving you much more pleasant music.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What if it doesn't reach the goal?<br/>
</h3> <ul> <li>I'm not taking any funds if I don't reach my goal! At that time I'll 
consider a simple Campaign for just the PCB's being printed. But I'm 
hoping at least 100 kits sell! I'd love to re-launch this several times 
because if I can make anything on it it then I'll get to develop more 
new kits/PCB's! <br/>
</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>The tour, I'd like to build a list of people whom can have a decent turn around time, and feature some comparable equipment. By that I definitely mean it's fantastic on things like Piega's Premium speakers. *Regulars on forums whom are known, are preferred for safety and publicity. <br/><br/>*Anyone is welcome to contribute, but I don't have T-shirts or anything like that for lower price points<br/>

Without achieving that goal I simply can't offer kits at a reasonable price (I can't get a big enough discount on buying parts for 10 kits)  Each kit costs $200 Shipped Priority USPS, so only donate in multiples of $200 for how many kits you want! (Contact me if you're not in the USA, I can adjust for shipping)
 I'm suppose to tell you about the perks... How about an R&D'd kit! It's Not your average willy-nilly mess of ground problem ridden DIY board. 
 The DIY7297 board and Antipole PSU come with every part you need. But you also get a transformer that has been selected for it's quality in multiple areas such as regulation, RF, and ease of use (Hammond 185 series). These parts are very nice. And luckily there's not too many so the cost doesn't become such a burden to afford the good stuff!

I do recommend 91db efficient or better speakers for the best performance, but at 87db it's quite enjoyable 

*Information will be included on how to raise the operating voltage but it'll be done at the expensive of not knowing how long the chip will last. *Resistors for this not included.



Some Details on Parts:The amplifier features Panasonic SEPF 330uf 25v OSCON power capacitors (12x), Rifa (now Kemet) PHE450 input capacitors (selected over many others including Orange Drops and Wima), and a special Kmultiplier that provides voltage regulation with a TL431 and two transistors; including a heatsink for the power transistor that can be mounted vertical/horizontal.The PSU features Coilcrafts combination Common Mode & Differential choke filter that combined with EPCOS's naked MKT Silver capacitors greatly increase the filtration of RF on low inductance copper pour planes right at the rectifiers (MSR860). The large capacitors are the CK version of the Nichicon KG series, the best they make, and chosen for their transparent lack of sound that capacitors such as Panasonic FC/FM simply cannot touch in any configuration. This in combination with the benefits of a dual bobbin transformer (Hammond 185) makes for a low noise, very nice power supply. The PCB boards are also quite nice, each one featuring orientation for the capacitors to have canceling fields, free of ground problems (star ground for for amp board connections, then to a copper pour), and very low inductance because of the copper pours. *Copper pours simply means that instead of a trace that's the size of a wire running, it's a plane of copper that extends as far as possible under and around all the vias (holes) that it can. It greatly reduces inductance created in tracings so that every piece that acts as a filter or path for noise will perform better, giving you much more pleasant music.




    What if it doesn't reach the goal?
  I'm not taking any funds if I don't reach my goal! At that time I'll 
consider a simple Campaign for just the PCB's being printed. But I'm 
hoping at least 100 kits sell! I'd love to re-launch this several times 
because if I can make anything on it it then I'll get to develop more 
new kits/PCB's! 

   Other Ways You Can HelpThe tour, I'd like to build a list of people whom can have a decent turn around time, and feature some comparable equipment. By that I definitely mean it's fantastic on things like Piega's Premium speakers. *Regulars on forums whom are known, are preferred for safety and publicity. *Anyone is welcome to contribute, but I don't have T-shirts or anything like that for lower price points",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

What is the brewing method and how does it work?</b></span></p><p>Our current functional prototype uses an expanding packet of fresh coffee that fills a stainless steel reservoir while brewing.  This allows the coffee to float freely in the water, similar to a French Press except without the press. Instead of pressing the grounds to the bottom like a French Press, the grounds are pulled and extracted from the coffee via removing the reusable coffee pod. This in combination with a gentle swirling motion produces a robust, smooth cup of coffee.  Friends, family and baristas are loving it!  And in addition to coffee you can make tea, hot chocolate, soup, oatmeal, and more!</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>2. How does the packet work?</b></span></p><p>The packet is constructed from a porous material that allows water to flow through while the coffee grounds remain inside; this makes cleanup a breeze!  This biodegradable material’s basic component is plant starch and will not alter the drink’s flavor in any way.  </p><p>The packets will be available pre-filled with many types of coffee, or empty to be filled by you with your own coffee.  Note: The final packet size is still being adjusted in order to optimize the brewing method.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>3. How do I charge the battery?</b></span></p><p>A battery charger is included in all <b>Jolt</b> bundles; we estimate it will take between 2-3 hours to charge.  The battery is removable from the device and is not required in order to enjoy your finished beverage.  You can charge one battery separately while using a second.  </p><p>Unfortunately, there is currently no way to charge the <b>Jolt</b> via USB or a car power socket due to the relatively low power available through these jacks.</p><p>We are thinking about a faster charger / docking station design that we've been able to get working in the lab.  This would charge the battery in 30 minutes and it would also allow you to “brew &amp; charge” at the same time!  If there is significant interest in this feature we may choose to add a fast charging station as a future additional priced upgrade.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>4. How and when do I add milk and sugar?</b></span></p><p>Milk and sugar can be poured directly into the inner reservoir after the steeping stage is complete. </p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are also considering incorporating compartments directly into the device to house and administer these items. While this isn’t guaranteed, if time and cost allow, it may be added to the final design.</span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>5. What temperature does the water reach?</b></span><br/></p><p>Unlike other portable brewers the <b>Jolt</b> is capable of reaching the true industry-accepted brewing temperature of 203°F (95°C).  This value will be configurable, allowing you to select the desired set point using the device’s physical button(s).  We will define these values within the device’s software as we hear feedback from our backers on desired temperature ranges.  Fun fact: during testing we confirmed our device is even capable of boiling water, which is in fact not the same temperature for brewing coffee!</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>6. How long will my drink stay warm? Is there a warming function?</b></span></p><p>The <b>Jolt</b> is insulated using a double-walled design that should keep your drink warm for hours. We have tested it and found the <b>Jolt</b> only dropped 10 degrees Fahrenheit multiple hours after brewing. Because of these great results, we decided to not include a warming function in order to keep the battery as light and low cost as possible.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>7.</b> </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">How heavy is the Jolt?</b></p><p>With a battery and full reservoir we expect the <b>Jolt</b> to weigh less than 2 lbs.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>8. Can I make tea?</b></span></p><p>Absolutely!  <b>Jolt's</b> single-reservoir design is especially suited to making tea.  We have added the ability for you to adjust and optimize the steeping temperature for perfectly brewing different varieties of tea.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>9. How much liquid can it hold?</b></span></p><p>The <b>Jolt</b> is targeted to produce 8-10 oz of coffee or tea. The size of the reservoir and the resulting volume of water to be heated directly affects the required battery size and how long it takes to heat the water.  We’ve experimented with reservoirs as large as 20 oz but opted to focus on a smaller form factor as shown in our video.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>10. Am I supposed to drink directly out of the lid like a travel mug or should I be pouring the beverage into a cup?</b></span></p><p>The opening at the lid was designed to do both but we expect most people to drink directly out of the <b>Jolt</b>.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>11. How many times can I brew on a single charge?</b></span></p><p>Right now we are targeting a single brew per charge to keep battery manufacturing costs as low as possible.  If there is significant interest, we may explore designing a larger capacity battery pack as an additionally priced upgrade which would be capable of brewing two cups off of a single charge.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>12. Can I bring it on a plane?</b></span></p><p>The largest battery we’ve built so far currently resides in our functional prototype and has a capacity of 90 watt-hours, but the final version of this product will have a smaller battery.  The FAA limit is 100 watt-hours, so you should have no problem bringing any version of this product on a plane.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>13. Can the Jolt operate or charge off a 12 Vdc automobile power socket?</b></span></p><p>Our heating design currently requires voltage-matched heating coils; this allows our device to come up to temperature faster than a Keurig!  An automobile socket is typically not capable of providing the current necessary to do this so we've opted to leave out a 12 Vdc coil.  For this reason the <b>Jolt</b> cannot be operated directly from a 12 Vdc source.  However, we may explore the possibility of a 12 Vdc charger for the battery depending on level of interest.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>14. Can I use other pre-made coffee pods such as K-cups or Nespresso Pods?</b></span></p><p>Although we considered accommodating existing pod designs, we wanted to unchain the <b>Jolt</b> from the single, proprietary packet paradigm.  Thus we are giving you the ability to purchase our eco-friendly pre-filled packets for on-the-go convenience or use your own coffee.  Choice is yours.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>15. Can I brew without the battery?</b></span></p><p>Possibly.  We have a patent-pending dual-coil heating element design that contains one coil for use with a battery and a second for use with a wall outlet.  This style of heating element takes up additional space inside the device and may cause the outer diameter of the cup to increase, however this would allow you to plug the device directly into a wall outlet and brew without the use of a battery. Our original prototypes did have this functionality but in order to keep the price of the device low, we chose to pursue a battery-only final design. If there is significant interest, we may include this as a new product model with a slightly higher price.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>16. Can the Jolt charge my phone?</b></span></p><p>Potentially.  This would require adding a USB port to the side of the <b>Jolt</b> and is a feature we have built and tested in the lab. If there is significant interest, this may be included as a feature on a new product model with a slightly higher price.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>17. Once brewing is complete can I detach the battery?</b></span></p><p>Yes!  Once brewing is complete the battery is no longer needed and can be detached from the cup.  This makes the <b>Jolt</b> no larger than a typical travel mug!</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>18. What do I do with the used coffee packet?</b></span></p><p>To ensure a perfect brew most people will prefer to remove the packet from the reservoir after the steeping stage.  It can then be disposed of in a trash can and due to the biodegradable material is completely broken down by microorganisms.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>19. Can the Jolt be used to heat up other foods?</b></span></p><p>The <b>Jolt</b> contains a stainless steel reservoir that is capable of heating other items such as soup, oatmeal or hot chocolate!</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>20. You mentioned the word software, can I adjust settings and create my own brewing profiles?</b></span></p><p>We’re exploring adding Bluetooth so the device can be paired to a phone or tablet, however iOS and Android app creation is not currently planned.  If there is significant interest, this may be included in a new product model with a higher price.</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>21. You have mentioned a lot of new features in these FAQs and in the Community Design Team section, will these be included with the current model I purchase with the existing perks? Can I upgrade to these new features with the pledge I give today?</b></span></p><p>The current model included in the perks is what we envision to be the widest reaching set of features needed by the most amount of people. So the current perks do not account for any of these additionally mentioned features. However, if we receive significant feedback asking for these features, we may introduce a new model that you can upgrade your existing pledge to. Because our existing model is our simplest, lowest cost design, a new model would likely be a higher priced model. Therefore, you would be able to upgrade your pledge by paying the additional amount needed. </p><br/><h1>Jolt Community Design Team</h1><p>We have way too many ideas and simply not enough time to incorporate them all. That’s where you come in. We want to know what features YOU think are important. The existing campaign price of $85 does not include any of these additional features. However, these are all features we have considered and some we have even tested and proven in the lab. If there is significant interest and feedback from the community, we may integrate these into a new, higher-priced model which you may upgrade your pledge to. Read on to discover all the brainstorming we’ve done throughout the last few years and why we pursued some ideas and not others.  We’re hoping this will spark your imagination and we look forward to hearing your suggestions. Welcome to the <b>Jolt Community Design Team</b>! </p><ol>
<li><p>Brewing Mechanism - Over the last 3 years we’ve considered many coffee brewing methods such as drip, vacuum, pour-over, and more.  We knew that controlling size and simplicity would be the best way to achieve the lowest cost and fastest time-to-market.  Ultimately we decided that a single reservoir was an important early design decision to keep the size as small as possible and that led us to focus on steeping methods for brewing coffee such as French Press.  However, we also considered using the drip method by incorporating a small pump that would pull water from the bottom of the reservoir and disburse it over a coffee-filled conical filter at the top.  We chose not to pursue this because the pump could re-circulate coffee through the grounds a second time and because of the design complexity of this type of system.  We’d love to hear feedback from the community on this and any other brewing methods you think might work in our design!</p></li>
<li><p>Battery - our battery design uses 10 lithium-ion cells to provide 37 Vdc.  Depending on the size and capacity of each individual cell, the battery can be capable of one or two brews on a full charge.  Battery capacity is synonymous with physical size, so a battery capable of 2 brews will roughly be 1.5x to 2.0x the size.  For those who envision needing a second brew via battery, we’d love to hear your feedback and preference here.  Would you rather have a larger battery pack or just carry two smaller batteries?</p></li>
<li><p>Brew &amp; Charge - are you interested in a docking station that allows you to both brew coffee or tea AND charge the battery at the same time?  If so, how many of these stations would you need and use?</p></li>
<li><p>Milk &amp; Sugar - how useful would you find dedicated compartments for milk and sugar packets?  Do you mind carrying these items separate from the <b>Jolt</b> and pouring them in yourself?</p></li>
<li><p>Warming Function - how important is this function to you?  How long do you plan on leaving your beverage in the <b>Jolt</b> before finishing it?</p></li>
<li><p>Other beverages - what else can you envision making in the <b>Jolt</b>?</p></li>
<li><p>Existing Coffee Pods - would you prefer to use existing coffee pods with the <b>Jolt</b> ?  How important is this to you?</p></li>
<li><p>Packet Disposal - some of our early concepts included a tray that allowed you to put the packet inside the reservoir but kept it out of the water.  A mechanism, either a knob or slide, would have to be operated in order to drop the packet into the water.  This same mechanism could then be used to lift the packet out of the water, effectively stopping the brewing process.  It could be left inside the reservoir indefinitely since the coffee would be designed to bypass it while pouring or drinking.  Does this interest you?  Would you mind if the device grew in size to accommodate this feature?</p></li>
<li><p>Software - if made available would you adjust brewing settings and create your own profiles?  Or are you okay with using preset profiles?</p></li>
<li><p>USB - some of our prototypes have an external USB port for charging mobile devices.  This is a natural addition to any device with a sizable battery, but we wonder how many people would actually use it.  Can you envision yourself in a scenario where your only option would be to charge your phone from the <b>Jolt</b>?</p></li>
</ol><br/></div>","Prototype Functionality: so far we have a fully functioning prototype as shown below.  It has not been designed into the final form factor shown in the video which serves to demonstrate the look and feel of the end product.  To do this we need custom-made components such as the heating element and reservoir which requires minimum order quantities.  That's why we're here.To view a time-lapsed video showing how our prototype can brew a cup of coffee using only battery power, watch the below GIFs or the full YouTube video here: http://bit.ly/2cPnbft1) Load the Jolt with any temperature water, hot or cold: 2) Once the Jolt reaches the perfect brewing temperature and the light turns green, insert the coffee packet (not shown in this earlier prototype is the reusable stainless steel coffee pod which can house your own coffee grounds or our eco-friendly packets): 3) After the brewing timer ends and the light turns blue after approximately 4 minutes of brew time, remove the coffee pod, toss out the coffee grounds or packet and enjoy your coffee or tea!  Jolt Indiegogo Technical FAQ1.

<h2><strong>Sorry, I missed the goal!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>And it is all my responsibility. I did not put enough efforts in promoting the campaign. </strong></p>
<p><strong>A heartfelt thank you to all of you who advised me and to the 2 generous contributors.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Of course the kakehashi project continues with direct contacts with the designers and concept developers interested in this beautiful inside and outside, traditional and contemporary ofuro.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please contact me by email/facebook/phone etc. </strong></p>
<p><strong>All the Best//</strong></p>
<p><strong>iacopo - sep/25/2017.</strong></p>
<hr/> <h2><strong>Who</strong></h2>
<p>Hi, my name is iacopo torrini and i am an Italian architect living and working in Japan for the past 20 years.<br/>Some of you know me also as the founder, manager and designer of bartok design japan, a company specialized in the design and production of traditional Japanese bathtubs made with hinoki wood and other Japanese conifers (asnaro, sawara, koyamaki).</p>
<p>I love Japanese hot springs and the feeling of peace and fullness while relaxing in the hot and aromatic water.<br/>I feel I have a mission as a <i>""bridge""  </i>to connect the master Japanese craftsmen with the expats and Japan-lovers worldwide who are able to appreciate these artifacts.</p>
<h2>Experience</h2>
<p>For this reason I have been producing and exporting over 300 bathtubs in the past 14 years.<br/>As a designer I like to apply the Japanese proverb which states that it is not by chance that men have <u>one mouth and two ears</u>. I like to listen to the requests of my clients and customize, adapt the shapes and details of my Ofuros to match the space and the functionality that is needed, case by case.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501204508/ndirrnpjjidtrcywdccj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Thanks to your inquiries I have been developing new details such as top rim overflow cuts, removable seats, reversible covers, slanted walls, sloped bottom plank and more.<br/>These new details have been implemented within the traditional techniques to prove that we are not ready yet for the reliquary of a museum: the handmade wooden tubs are a live product in harmonic evolution from its beautiful history.</p>
<h2>New Technology</h2>
<p>I am now ready to write a new chapter of this evolution and it has been a few years now that I am caressing this new project. What strikes about Japanese bathtubs is their minimalist design. They are very modern while being traditional.<br/>For those who are attracted by the naturalism and the historical heritage behind the Ofuro, than our present custom order bathtubs produced by bartok design are perfect for you.</p>
<p>But if you are looking for even more sleek and revolutionary shapes you are ready for this new product.<br/>I will call it ""KAKEHASHI"" which means ""bridge"",  because this idea connects and conjugates the tradition with the innovation, natural materials with cutting edge technology, and the Japanese sensibility with a world of sensuous curved shapes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501210450/y0oq6ktas0kcrkss6obo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With the traditional techniques it is possible to create circular, oval shapes or round cornered rectangles with the limitation of having to cope with the metal bands which are needed to keep together the barrel type construction.<br/> <br/>With the new ""KAKEHASHI"" technique I am presenting here, I will be able to make any convex curve and even concave shapes!

And it is all my responsibility. I did not put enough efforts in promoting the campaign. 
A heartfelt thank you to all of you who advised me and to the 2 generous contributors.
Of course the kakehashi project continues with direct contacts with the designers and concept developers interested in this beautiful inside and outside, traditional and contemporary ofuro.
Please contact me by email/facebook/phone etc. 
All the Best//
iacopo - sep/25/2017.
 Who
Hi, my name is iacopo torrini and i am an Italian architect living and working in Japan for the past 20 years.Some of you know me also as the founder, manager and designer of bartok design japan, a company specialized in the design and production of traditional Japanese bathtubs made with hinoki wood and other Japanese conifers (asnaro, sawara, koyamaki).
I love Japanese hot springs and the feeling of peace and fullness while relaxing in the hot and aromatic water.I feel I have a mission as a ""bridge""  to connect the master Japanese craftsmen with the expats and Japan-lovers worldwide who are able to appreciate these artifacts.
Experience
For this reason I have been producing and exporting over 300 bathtubs in the past 14 years.As a designer I like to apply the Japanese proverb which states that it is not by chance that men have one mouth and two ears. I like to listen to the requests of my clients and customize, adapt the shapes and details of my Ofuros to match the space and the functionality that is needed, case by case.
Thanks to your inquiries I have been developing new details such as top rim overflow cuts, removable seats, reversible covers, slanted walls, sloped bottom plank and more.These new details have been implemented within the traditional techniques to prove that we are not ready yet for the reliquary of a museum: the handmade wooden tubs are a live product in harmonic evolution from its beautiful history.
New Technology
I am now ready to write a new chapter of this evolution and it has been a few years now that I am caressing this new project. What strikes about Japanese bathtubs is their minimalist design. They are very modern while being traditional.For those who are attracted by the naturalism and the historical heritage behind the Ofuro, than our present custom order bathtubs produced by bartok design are perfect for you.
But if you are looking for even more sleek and revolutionary shapes you are ready for this new product.I will call it ""KAKEHASHI"" which means ""bridge"",  because this idea connects and conjugates the tradition with the innovation, natural materials with cutting edge technology, and the Japanese sensibility with a world of sensuous curved shapes.

With the traditional techniques it is possible to create circular, oval shapes or round cornered rectangles with the limitation of having to cope with the metal bands which are needed to keep together the barrel type construction. With the new ""KAKEHASHI"" technique I am presenting here, I will be able to make any convex curve and even concave shapes! The curved walls can be straight or even slanted in and out, free as a freehand sketch.The ""KAKEHASHI"" technique does not have exposed metal parts and the look is very organic and natural.Eventually I am planning to create triangular tubs, flower shaped, fan shaped, eggplant shaped tubs. Anyway the first one, the protagonist of this very crowdfunding campaign will have the shape of a crescent. Perfect for 2 people, the moon shaped ofuro is a tribute to the lunar side of the japanese aesthetics and is suitable for a flexible layout as you can encroach it with a plant, a table or whetever you want to keep by your side while you are enjoying your bath.The ""KAKEHASHI"" tubs will have a pneumatic controlled popup drain and overflow system concealed inside the walls.

The technological breakthrough of the KAKEHASHI Ofuro is its laminated structure.The walls are made by a fiberglass mold coated inside and outside with a 7-15mm layer of real solid quarter-sawn Japanese lumber.I will make tubs with premium hinoki from the Kiso Valley or asnaro wood from aomori prefecture.The fiberglass core will assure stability and partially compensate for the dilatation and contraction of the wood fibers while the wood finishing layer will provide the same pure aroma and soft touch of a wooden ofuro build with the traditional technique.

As you can see from the picture above the KAKEHASHI Ofuro is completely handmade and hand finished so there is actually less use of powertools compared to the making of a traditional Ofuro.
What you get
There is a lot of work involved in creating these ofuros and the price of the ""KAKEHASHI"" tubs will be more expensive compared with traditional tubs.As I am launching the new product and are eager to create a range of different shapes and a series of examples of actual installations, I decided to use a crowdfunding campaign to promote the launch.
If you like the idea, it is a unique opportunity for you as well. You will be able to own a kakehashi bathtub for about half of the price. The ""tsuki-buro"" (moon-shaped-bathtub) with ext. sizes of 1950x1000x700mm and int. sizes of 1800x900x600mm will sell for 4,400,000 JPY plus shipping costs.

<li>The EPA estimates landscape irrigation accounts for 30% to 60% of a households water usage depending on geography. And as much as 50% of that is waste due to inefficient irrigation methods and systems.</li>
<li>Water rates in 30 major cities across the U.S. increased more than 40% between 2010 and 2015.  Projections are for even higher increases as populations increase and water delivery infrastructure continues to age.</li>
<li>In 2015 California passed a law forcing cities and water districts to reduce usage by as much as 25% and allowing them to fine water wasters up to $500 a day. Similar rules and fines are in place throughout much of the country.</li>
<li>According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the American mountain west region has been in a drought 11 of the last 14 years.</li>

We use the capacitance technique which is fairly straightforward and one of the most widely used methods but accuracy can be affected by a variety of factors, most notably soil type and salinity.  We have taken steps to mitigate these factors but require data from field trials in order to train Conductor to compensate.  Peak 8 will be conducting a number of field trials in homes, municipalities, and corporate campuses in the Colorado Front Range area, and if Gateway contributors elect to share their data, we can use that data to increase our sample size and regional footprint.  You can be part of the process to help teach Conductor by sharing your data and responding regularly to landscape health alerts.</p><p>A list of key technical risks:</p><ul>
<li>DoodleBug is powered by a single AAA battery with a power budget that is designed to last 2 to 3 years when used in IoT Mesh Network mode and 1 year in Bluetooth mode.  At this time our prototypes are built from circuits with debugging features that draw power so we have only been able to calculate a battery life estimate.  Live device testing is required to see if we can hit our target.</li>
<li>DoodleBug will be exposed to temperature extremes ranging from -20 F to +120 F.  In many regions like Colorado the average temperatures can swing more than 40 F from Spring to Summer to Fall and there can be routine temperature swings of 30 F in a single day.  In addition to reducing battery life, these temperature fluctuations can also affect the accuracy of the circuits measuring soil capacitance.  We have taken steps to mitigate this in the sensor and Conductor will be designed to correlate measurements to temperature and compensate for any changes, but we won't know more until field trial data is obtained.</li>
<li>2.4GHz radios used for Bluetooth, Zigbee and Thread are quite common place today but still require a great deal of expertise to manufacture consistently and obtain certifications. Delays are quite common, even with experienced teams.</li>
</ul><p>Some other risks:</p><ul><li>Conductor can only be delivered with DoodleBug if stretch funding goals are achieved. Otherwise, delivery of Conductor will be delayed until we can secure further investment later in the year. </li></ul><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Partners.</h2><p>Peak 8 Connected products are manufactured by our friends at <a href=""http://clearblueengineering.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Clear Blue Engineering</a>, located in Lafayette, CO.  </p><p>Arrow Electronics is supporting us with design and manufacturing reviews and component supply chain.</p><p>Siren Video, located in Boulder Colorado, did our video production.</p><p>TechrIoT, located in Englewood Colorado, is providing support for emerging startups in the IoT space.</p><p>Thank you!</p></div>","If you answered yes to any of these questions then you are throwing money away on excess water and damaged landscaping.  Peak 8 Connected wants to develop a solution for you and needs your help! Meet DoodleBug.noun  |  doo * dle * bug""a device (as a divining rod) used in attempting to locate underground gas, water, oil, or ores""DoodleBug is a small but powerful device that measures the volumetric water content of the soil at the optimal root zone for your landscape and garden.  With two versions measuring at depths of 5"" and 10"",  you can gain great insights into the performance of your irrigation system and whether you are delivering the right amount of water for your landscape to thrive, while eliminating excess. How it Works.The divining rod is inserted into the ground, keeping the cap at or above ground level.

Gateway is a border router that establishes a Thread compliant WLAN and securely bridges the network to your WiFi router. Once your DoodleBug devices are enrolled with the Gateway you can begin to receive a number of useful alerts on your mobile device when there are conditions that warrant your attention.   Sign up for one or more of the following alerts:With a connected irrigation controller, you can respond to alerts by adjusting your irrigation schedule right from your mobile device.  Peak 8's future product roadmap includes wireless valve control modules, but there are several connected controllers available today from other fine manufacturers.  Or Turn Over Control to Conductor. Peak 8 Connected is developing Conductor, a cloud-based learning engine engineered to manage your irrigation system using data obtained from your DoodleBug devices, weather forecasts, and information you provide about soil type, plant type, and more.Conductor builds on this and other knowledge and works with your irrigation controllers to maintain soil moisture content levels appropriate for your landscape. To help Conductor learn and make better decisions, enable and reply to the periodic Landscape Health Queries. Your input will help to fine tune the performance of your irrigation system. Accessories. Why DoodleBug?Peak 8 Connected was founded by a small group of engineers in Colorado who are alarmed at the impact of the drought in California and our own states seemingly short memory regarding the pain and cost of our last drought a decade ago.Populations have increased but water reserves have not kept pace. Even states like Florida with subtropical climates are experiencing strains on fresh water reserves due to explosive population growth that has averaged a 42% increase every 10 years since it joined the union!It stands to reason that if we don’t take steps to use water more efficiently, the next drought will be more painful and costly than the last. Peak 8 Connected wants to do its part by developing products that allow homeowners, landscape managers, municipalities, and corporate/education campuses manage their irrigation to the landscapes needs while cutting waste and reducing average consumption.Some Interesting Facts.
The EPA estimates landscape irrigation accounts for 30% to 60% of a households water usage depending on geography. And as much as 50% of that is waste due to inefficient irrigation methods and systems.
Water rates in 30 major cities across the U.S. increased more than 40% between 2010 and 2015.  Projections are for even higher increases as populations increase and water delivery infrastructure continues to age.
In 2015 California passed a law forcing cities and water districts to reduce usage by as much as 25% and allowing them to fine water wasters up to $500 a day. Similar rules and fines are in place throughout much of the country.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the American mountain west region has been in a drought 11 of the last 14 years.
Climate change is projected to result in more severe droughts leading to stress on already over stressed fresh water resources.

Our minimum funding level is $125,000.  This amount will cover all expenses associated with development and manufacturing of the DoodleBug and Gateway devices including tooling, materials, assembly, testing, and obtaining FCC/CE and Bluetooth SIG certifications.  There is risk at this level of funding as it doesn't leave much room for error. However, our founder and team collectively have several decades of experience developing and manufacturing embedded electronic products and we have confidence that if we hit this target we will be able to meet our obligations.We are setting a stretch goal of at least $450,000 to fund the development of Conductor. This level of funding will also allow more margin for error in all of our activities, add staff to mitigate development risks, build stronger supplier partnerships, and move into improved facilities. Your support is very much appreciated!Where Does Your Donation Go?Minimum funding goalStretch funding goal Where We Are At.DoodleBug is completing the prototyping stage and ready for early production.Major accomplishments so far

TimelineField trials will suspend for winter months but development on Conductor will continue on a monthly release schedule until field trials resume in the spring. What Keeps Us Up At Night.There is risk in any new endeavor and this project is not without its fair share.  DoodleBug measures soil moisture content by measuring the dielectric of the soil which increases significantly when water is added. We use the capacitance technique which is fairly straightforward and one of the most widely used methods but accuracy can be affected by a variety of factors, most notably soil type and salinity.  We have taken steps to mitigate these factors but require data from field trials in order to train Conductor to compensate.  Peak 8 will be conducting a number of field trials in homes, municipalities, and corporate campuses in the Colorado Front Range area, and if Gateway contributors elect to share their data, we can use that data to increase our sample size and regional footprint.  You can be part of the process to help teach Conductor by sharing your data and responding regularly to landscape health alerts.A list of key technical risks:
DoodleBug is powered by a single AAA battery with a power budget that is designed to last 2 to 3 years when used in IoT Mesh Network mode and 1 year in Bluetooth mode.  At this time our prototypes are built from circuits with debugging features that draw power so we have only been able to calculate a battery life estimate.  Live device testing is required to see if we can hit our target.
DoodleBug will be exposed to temperature extremes ranging from -20 F to +120 F.  In many regions like Colorado the average temperatures can swing more than 40 F from Spring to Summer to Fall and there can be routine temperature swings of 30 F in a single day.  In addition to reducing battery life, these temperature fluctuations can also affect the accuracy of the circuits measuring soil capacitance.  We have taken steps to mitigate this in the sensor and Conductor will be designed to correlate measurements to temperature and compensate for any changes, but we won't know more until field trial data is obtained.
2.4GHz radios used for Bluetooth, Zigbee and Thread are quite common place today but still require a great deal of expertise to manufacture consistently and obtain certifications. Delays are quite common, even with experienced teams.
Some other risks:Conductor can only be delivered with DoodleBug if stretch funding goals are achieved. Otherwise, delivery of Conductor will be delayed until we can secure further investment later in the year.  Our Partners.Peak 8 Connected products are manufactured by our friends at Clear Blue Engineering, located in Lafayette, CO.  Arrow Electronics is supporting us with design and manufacturing reviews and component supply chain.Siren Video, located in Boulder Colorado, did our video production.TechrIoT, located in Englewood Colorado, is providing support for emerging startups in the IoT space.Thank you!",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

Thus creating an anaerobic environment, where organisms such as lactic acid bacteria work to produce lactic acid. The lactic acid acidifies the organic material, lowers the pH and creates the conditions that promote preservation.

Using Ekokamu® is a simple and hygienic way to recycle biowaste – and its elegant design does not need to be hidden from view.Ekokamu’s concept is based on an integrated air pump system that prevents the decomposition of biowaste. Stylish design and beautiful colours are an important part of the concept: we wanted to create a biowaste container that is so hygienic and stylish that you can keep it on the kitchen table, where it is easy to use. No additional odours or liquids are created in the container. With Ekokamu you can say goodbye to smelly and ugly biowaste bags in your kitchen. Ekokamu keeps its contents dry and fresh.Ekokamu was invented to meet a real need. Most of us want to do the right thing, and recycle biowaste, don’t we?Ekokamu’s operating mechanism, based on vacuum technology, was invented by Ph.D. Annukka Pakarinen. She was inspired by an everyday problem we all know: handling biowaste is not easy and it’s not pleasant. This is the problem Ekokamu addresses. Ekokamu makes doing the right thing easy and pleasant!Pakarinen, a mother of four living in a single-family house, spotted the problem as something she wanted to fix for herself. Pakarinen has a Master’s degree in chemistry and a Doctorate in agricultural biotechnology. Her interest in utilising the biowaste created in the food chain arises from a combination of strong professional expertise and a desire to solve the problems she encounters in her own everyday life, and this has resulted in the Ekokamu biowaste container, which makes possible the almost odour-free handling of biowaste without any extra moisture.The key idea of Ekokamu is to make recycling easy and stylish. We want to make the user experience as smooth and simple as possible. There is only one switch to open and close the Ekokamu!Ekokamu keeps biowaste fresh 1-2 weeks. When the container is full, biowaste is disposed of in the way that is suitable for you, depending on where you live and how it is organized in your city. It can be placed for example in your condominium’s biowaste container or you can put it in your compost if you have one.
Watch the video and let us show you how easy Ekokamu is to use!

As a product, the Ekokamu biowaste container is still in its infancy, but the method itself is already mature. Ekokamu's operating method is based on extensive research and testing. The vacuum method used by Ekokamu enables a completely new way of handling household biowaste.The method for improving the preservation of waste is based on a biological mechanism that prevents the action of harmful microbes and enables the activity of the desirable microbes living in biowaste.

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>WiFi Drop is a very tiny open source micro-controller board equipped with a powerful ARM Cortex-M3 controller and a 802.11 b/g WiFi module. The micro-controller is programmable directly via USB. There is no need for an additional programmer.  All the project related things will be public.</p>
<p>Very high performance programs can be implement with C or C++. We will provide hardware abstraction libraries to make the low-level programming of applications easier and faster. </p>
<p></p>
<p>And finally, 10 programmable I/O pins are available to use the module in your very own application. They are easy to access via standard pin headers on both sides of the module. The pin header spacing is perfectly aligned to use the WiFi Drop board with breadboards and perfboards.</p>

<h2>DEMO APPLICATIONS</h2>
<div>
<p><b>A Wireless RGB LED strip control application. </b></p>
<p>This demo shows how you can connect to the WiFi Drop and communicate with it. I implemented a minimalistic HTTP server which serves a small website (the color picker from the video) with some Javascript code. When you click on the color wheel, the RGB color code is sent with an AJAX request to the WiFi Drop. The micro controller is processing the request and adjusts its three channel PWM output to control the color of the LED strip.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<div>
<p><strong>Can you indicate the power supply requirements of the module?</strong></p>
<p>
At this time, we haven't measured the exact power consumption of the module. According to the CC3000 datasheet, the WIFI module can consume a maximum of 275mA. If I have to guess, the over all power consumption of the module will be around 350mA.
</p>
<p>The module can either be powered directly over USB or with an external 5V power supply over the external pin header.</p>
<p><strong>Are there interfaces like SPI, I2C, UART available?</strong></p>
<p>
All controller pins on the pin headers can be used as GPIOs. Additionally, there are some hardware features available.

</div></div>","WHAT IS WiFi Drop?

WiFi Drop is a very tiny open source micro-controller board equipped with a powerful ARM Cortex-M3 controller and a 802.11 b/g WiFi module. The micro-controller is programmable directly via USB. There is no need for an additional programmer.  All the project related things will be public.
Very high performance programs can be implement with C or C++. We will provide hardware abstraction libraries to make the low-level programming of applications easier and faster. 

And finally, 10 programmable I/O pins are available to use the module in your very own application. They are easy to access via standard pin headers on both sides of the module. The pin header spacing is perfectly aligned to use the WiFi Drop board with breadboards and perfboards.







We are also going to make the board compatible to the very well-known and commonly used Arduino platform.





All project related software will be open source. It will be public on a public GIT repository.




The schematics and layout files will be open hardware. Feel free to integrate it into your own project.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Manufacturing upcycled wooden indoor lamps made with the wood from the flameholder of Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018! For the most special piece of world peace and sustainability on your cozy bedside!</p>
<p>Celebrating Winter Olympic Games PyeongChang 2018 hosted in South Korea and making an attempt for it to be the most sustainable Olympic ever, the very first upcycling brand in S.Korea, TOUCH4GOOD, finally opens a crowdfunding campaign on indiegogo.</p>
<p>Hurray!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<ul><li>
<h3><strong>TOUCH4GOOD, Who we are</strong></h3>
<p>We are TOUCH4GOOD, a social enterprise pursuing better environment, - as well as the very first upcycling brand in South Korea established in 2008. Since then, we have been pursuing TOUCHING people’s mind and letting them think of environmental issues by TOUCHING waste and turning them into upcycled goods.</p> <p>A fe examples of what we have done …</p>
</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">1) Bags and pouches made with used placards and banners</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">2) Blankets made with self-developed fabric from used PET bottles</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">3) Crayons made of used/expired lipsticks</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">4) DIY catch-ball playing sets made with used tubes</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">5) Bags made with abandoned fire hoses</p>

<div style=""text-align: center;"">(TOUCH4GOOD on Arrirang TV, a Korea broadcast)</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;""> </div>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We try everything we can to  to decrease waste and boost up the life cycle of things for a better environment in the world.</p>
</div></div>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><h3><strong>Why We Are Here, </strong></h3></li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We have a great event being held in Korea right now, the Olympic Winter Games, so as a S.Korean upcycle brand, we set a new goal, touching wastes from Olympic to decrease the amount of them.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Thus, we carefully researched on what going to be thrown away carefully the Olympic period, and the nice flameholder on top of the stadium jumped into our eyes.

Manufacturing upcycled wooden indoor lamps made with the wood from the flameholder of Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018! For the most special piece of world peace and sustainability on your cozy bedside!
Celebrating Winter Olympic Games PyeongChang 2018 hosted in South Korea and making an attempt for it to be the most sustainable Olympic ever, the very first upcycling brand in S.Korea, TOUCH4GOOD, finally opens a crowdfunding campaign on indiegogo.
Hurray!
 

TOUCH4GOOD, Who we are
We are TOUCH4GOOD, a social enterprise pursuing better environment, - as well as the very first upcycling brand in South Korea established in 2008. Since then, we have been pursuing TOUCHING people’s mind and letting them think of environmental issues by TOUCHING waste and turning them into upcycled goods. A fe examples of what we have done …

1) Bags and pouches made with used placards and banners
2) Blankets made with self-developed fabric from used PET bottles
3) Crayons made of used/expired lipsticks
4) DIY catch-ball playing sets made with used tubes
5) Bags made with abandoned fire hoses
and the list goes on…


(TOUCH4GOOD on Arrirang TV, a Korea broadcast)
 
We try everything we can to  to decrease waste and boost up the life cycle of things for a better environment in the world.

 
Why We Are Here, 
We have a great event being held in Korea right now, the Olympic Winter Games, so as a S.Korean upcycle brand, we set a new goal, touching wastes from Olympic to decrease the amount of them.
Thus, we carefully researched on what going to be thrown away carefully the Olympic period, and the nice flameholder on top of the stadium jumped into our eyes. We found out that the parts made of iron are going to be reused after being disassembled, and then the parts made of wood is going to become trash. Think of it, a splendid flameholder that faces inevitable tragic fate, being thrown away!

(The image of the flameholder before the opening ceremony)
So we have decided to upcycle them to save them and let them revive. How? We can make this happen, indeed, with our know-how of ten years.
And for this time, we will willingly be a Prometheus for you.
 

LET YOU SHINE, 
as everyone and this flame light shine
We believe that our job, upcycle things, is basically digging deep to look for things that have potential but  not found yet, discovering and bringing out the potential, and letting them shine.
Thus, we are in wholehearted agreement with the title of the theme song for this Olympic, ‘LET EVERYONE SHINE’.

 
Who and what is 'EVERYONE' for us?
As the phrase says, we really wish you, I, we and even the things continue to shine. We thought the most proper symbol for our wish is ‘Sacred Olympic Flame’.

(Picture from http://www.sportsnet.ca)
Believe or not, the sacred fire is referred never to be exhausted. The Scared Olympic Flame of PyeongChang will also not to be exhausted and rather be delivered to your place and continue to shine in your sweet home as a symbol of your shining life.
Standing for our wish for you and us, we put our all the best and cheer in this product we propose you below.
 
< The spirit of the Sacred Fire > in Your Home, 
The flame from PyeongChang
You may have already figured out our intention, we prepared lamps. Nothing can be more suitable than lamps to embody the spirit of the flame. Right?
Here are three version of wooden table mood lamps with a classic bulb on them, symbolizing the Scared Olympic Flame from Olympia. We desire that our passion, our sportsmanship, and our spirit shines and goes on in your life, just like the Flame.

 
Design
1) The Pedestal
The designs are pretty simple yet modern.
We have three versions of pedestal. Two have shapes originated from the Korean alphabet, and the other one has high-slide shapeof the flameholder in PyeongChang.
 
option #1: < The spirit of Sacred Fire > on ㅍ
option #2: < The spirit of Sacred Fire > on ㅊ
option #3: < The spirit of Sacred Fire > on the top tier
 
[Option#1, 2: ㅍ & ㅊ]
The shape of the pedestal that looks like a rectangle and star each are from the Korean alphabet ㅍ and ㅊ, which makes the sound of P and Ch, the sounds from PyeongChang. (You might easily find out that these shapaes are also similar with the emblem of this Olympic.)
(FYI, here is the additional official video about the emblem)

We carved a hole to arrange electric wire neatly, put the switch in the middle of the cable so that you can easily switch on and off.
 





- Dimensions: option #1 : 130mm X 140mm X 29mm (approx 175mm include bulb)                            option #2: 150mm X 1500mm X 29mm (approx 200mm include bulb)- Bulb Spec : 220V, 60Hz, 40W
 
[Option#3:On the top tier]
The last one is unlike other options, modeled as the shape of the fireholder of PyeongChang with combined sheets of plywood. If you are a person who loves to endeavor, strive, achieve and be top-tier, you will love the attracts of this design.


 

(There is no slogan on the top-tier design in the picture above, but there will be engraved slogan at the curved side on the finished goods.)
- Dimensions: option #3 : 100mm X 200mm X 101.5mm (approx 121.5mm include bulb)- Bulb Spec : 220V, 60Hz, 40W
 
2) The Phrase
On every pedestal, there is a phrase ‘LET _____ SHINE’.  You can interpret the blank in your own way. Put your own name, your beloved people and favorite things.

3) The Bulbs
We have chosen classic bulbs to express the movement of the flame through the shape of filaments. There are two types of bulbs, a sphere shape for ㅍ and a teardrop shape for ㅊ.
 

Material
If we made these lamps with wood by cutting down more trees or have brought the wood from somewhere else, it would not be meaningful.
However,
we will REALLY make them with the wood of the flameholder that is NOW in PyeongChang. For the sake of sustainability and green growth. Remember, We are the first ‘upcycling’ brand in S.Korea.
Yes, it is definitely the flameholder you have seen on the TV last Friday, 9th Feb, 2018.



 

(Yes, the scene right above!)
 
Risk & Challenges
We are qualified to make this happen
We are not the only people who is trying to make this Olympic & Paralympic sustainable. There are many people working in Olympic Organizing Committee, construction companies, Gangneung City government & the Korean government.
Despite the hustle, they are cooperating to make the Olympic eco-friendly & green. We have already had several meetings with the stakeholders mentioned above, and have shook hands on this project.
Thus, the feasibility of this project is very high, so no worries.
 
Caution : the nature of upcycled goods
Naturally, the upcycled goods​ have their own characteristic. The samples you have seen on this page were all made with not-upcycled material so that there is a possibility that the color of woods used on the final goods is not totally same with the pictures above. Also, the shape of the cross section can be a bit different.
However, we will try to make the final goods in high quality, by careful checking out the materials we use and putting on additional post-processing.

 
Timeline
Just a day after the end of the Paralympic, 19th, Mar., we are going to head to PyeongChang ourselves to pick up the wood and take it to our workspace to manufactue right away.
Since, we do not have enough warehouse space to conserve all the wood thrown away during the whole event, we will just take as much as we need for this project before the remaining wood is burnt.
 
It means that the more backers we have, the more wood we can save.
Join our journey to make a sustainable Olympic as well as let everything, everybody, everyone shine with this lamp !

From your smartphone, control how, when  and where you toss food to your pets, making meal time more fun and keeping your dog active even when you’re not around.    Lovoom lets you control the distance and direction of your food launch, keeping your pet entertained for hours. Toss food from approximately 3 to 10 feet (1 to 3 meters) and rotate 180 +/- 90 degrees to keep you pet on its toes, never knowing where the next snack is coming from. This helps keep dogs on the lazier side from becoming couch potatoes.  Lovoom tosses food at a 60 degree angle. While that number might at first sound random, it’s anything but that. It was actually specifically chosen to mimic how humans actually toss, making it a more natural and enjoyable activity for your pet. Lovoom works with dry, small pet food. There’s an adapter available for food that’s really tiny. By tossing just one piece at a time, you control the fun and ensure there is no mess. Plus, no one gets too spoiled or chubby. Stuck in a meeting with no access to your smartphone? Your pets can still play happily while you’re busy and not looking at the Lovoom app. Set a schedule advance so that Lovoom launches food on a timer even when you can’t manually do it yourself.  Lovoom features full HD 720p* video, so you’ll see your pet nearly as clearly as you would if you were in the same room, up to 180 degrees, so you can truly see it all. You can record videos or take photos of adorable pet moments from your phone and store them on the cloud. Share with your friends or your social media followers so everyone can get a daily dose of your pet’s cuteness. (*Please note that we have chosen HD 720p in order to provide you with a better camera view.

It works on numerous projects to prevent violence and educate people, especially children and youth, on the topics needed to successfully manage life through personal development by acquiring knowledge, skills and abilities.EduKamp is the largest academy of this kind for children and youth in the world and as such is open for participants from all over the world. It will be entirely made of natural materials (stone and wood) to be environmentally friendly and to keep children and youth safe in it.The idea is conceived as an entertaining educational academy located in the very nature on 35,000 m2. It is a camp that provides additional education according with the students' age, motivates them for lifelong learning, teaches co-operation and numerous skills.Students would stay in nature, learn about it and how to use its resources in an appropriate and responsible ways. Through various educational activities, students will gain life skills. The activities of the camp would include education on how to get along with nature, scouting, fishing, crafting of various items with hands using natural materials (wood, stone), small cooking academy, various art workshops, foreign language learning etc. All activities would be based on mutual co-operation between students and students and leaders of education.The total cost of running the EduKamp project is USD 2,6 million, of which USD 2,3 million is intended for the construction of the camp. The rest of the money is provided to equip camp with the materials needed for education, carrying out various activities and additional costs. THE IMPACTToday children and youth spend very little time in nature and they are not familiar with it, nor do they coexist with it. They spend more and more time on mobile phones and computers and increasingly disconnect from the real world, which negatively affects their development and society as a whole. EduKamp provides children and youth the opportunity to develop life skills that are important to answer the demands and challenges of everyday life in acceptable ways with the preservation of mental and physical health.Through the stay in nature and numerous educational activities, students will develop
ability to make decisions,
ability to solve problems,
divergent and critical thinking,
communication and social skills,
self-awareness,
empathy,
ability to recognize and express emotions,
ability to respond appropriately to specific situations,
ability to prevent violence,
verbal and nonverbal expression skills,
skills of working with own hands,
skills needed for orientation in nature.
 They will gain knowledge about
natural laws,
flora and fauna,
the impact of humans on nature,
the importance of respecting nature,
sustainable development,
environmental issues,
coexistence of humans, plants and animals,
healthy eating,
planting and cultivation of plants.

DasEgg makes your live better

DasEgg provides people with the freedom to grow everything wherever they live. 
Many
of us live in flats and have no garden anymore. A lot of houses do not even
have balconies. Often there is also no time to look after plants regularly. 
But
most of us love nature and would like to grow their own plants, be it veg like

beautiful plant that means a lot to you because it reminds you of something or

We need you as contributor 
To make our dream of this design greenhouse come true and to make DasEgg available for you and others, we need your help. 
Mainly for these 3 main areas we need your financial support:

We already invested a lot of our own money and with your help we can finally produce DasEgg for you!

<div>
<p>Imagine that you have
your car parked outdoors and it's a rainy day, so you take your umbrella out
and go from point A (your house for example) to point B (your car) or vice
versa. So after you've walked to your car you face the apparently simple task
of getting inside the car, but if you are trying to avoid getting wet and keep water away from your car's interior it's not as easy as it sounds. You have to close the umbrella just the right way, quickly enough so
that you don't slam it with the door (not to mention your hand or foot). Even
if you avoid all these you still have a very wet umbrella inside your car,
which will soak your seats, clothes or papers in your door holder. </p>
<p>It is also a problem
while trying to get out of the car in a rainy day, as you try to open your
umbrella in a hurry, through the tiny opening you left as to not let any water
inside the car and then rapidly shut it closed.</p>
</div>
<div><h3>The Solution</h3></div>
<div>What we offer is an easy do it yourself (DIY) installation product that solves this problem.</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p>We are able to incorporate a
tent-like umbrella inside the doorframe of your car. So when you open the
door a special fabric (attached from one end to the frame and from the other to
the inside of the door) unrolls itself from the topside of the doorframe
creating a rain shield. This allows the driver or passenger to get in their
seats without hassling about rainwater. You can calmly sit or stand beneath the
rain guard, set your belongings inside, shake the excess water off the umbrella
and close it, get in your seat and finally close the door. The Rain Smart will
store itself inside the car's doorframe seamlessly.</p>

The Solution
What we offer is an easy do it yourself (DIY) installation product that solves this problem.

We are able to incorporate a

<p>About this project</p>
<p>The idea for Drinkware Stacker was born due to my living circumstances. When living in NYC it's typical to have a tiny apartment and never enough space. My apartment is very well organized so reorganizing wasn't a space saving option and there just wasn't any storage space available. Since I needed more space in my kitchen cabinets I knew I had to do something different, which is, tap into any unused real estate available. I saw an opportunity in the airspace between the drinkware I had and the shelf, the space was just wasted, so I got to the drawing board (where I spent over a year of my time :) btw) and was able to create just the perfect product for it.</p>

<p>I have a passion in inventing products that can make people's lives easier and more fun, which is my way of making a difference in the world. Unfortunately, inventing and developing products is not cheap, it is very costly, and sometimes we need help to make it happen. I was able to produce the first batch, which was not the quantity I wanted to bring the price down enough to make any profit. With enough funds I'll be able to make a large production run that will make it possible for me to scale this product and help a lot of kitchens with their space. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need at least $4000 to make this happen, but getting more would help us scaling with other colors as well, we will start with orange color. All the funds will go into inventory, all other work is done.</p>

<h3>Rydon Pixio</h3>
<p>At Rydon we believe that your bicycle light should always be there, just like your handlebar or saddle. It has to be permanently mounted on your bicycle and should always work, so you never have to worry about it. With this concept in mind we started the development of the Rydon Pixio about 5 years ago. We have designed and tested a lot of ideas until we could fit it all together in one unique product.</p>
<p>We have finished all the production tools and tested the first production samples. We are ready to put the Rydon Pixio on the market.</p>
<p>To produce the lights at a competitive price, we need to order a minimum quantity of 1000 pieces. We will use the earnings from this campaign to produce the lights and build a small stock of lights. Then we will also have the financial means to start marketing activities to make the lights available in the stores.</p>
<p><strong>What's in it for you?</strong></p>
<p>As a backer of our project you will be one of the first to get a your very own Rydon Pixio from the very first production batch and the satisfaction of knowing you were one of the individuals who helped us make the Rydon Pixio a success.</p>
This campaign is a fixed funding campaign, which means we need to reach our goal of 20.000 euro. For backers, this means that you either get a really cool product if we reach this goal, or we refund your money if we don't reach it.
<p>For <strong>US customers</strong>, the prices are in euro, below is an overview for the prices in  US dollars:</p>
<p>Thanks                € 5   = $ 6</p>
<p>Single                  € 30 = $ 39</p>
<p>Set                     € 55  = $ 73</p>
<p>Set deluxe           € 60  = $ 79</p>
<p>Family pack         € 250 = $ 332</p>
<p>Family deluxe      € 275 = $ 365</p>
<p>Reseller pack      € 777 = $ 1032</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Product</h3>
<p>The Rydon Pixio contains several unique features:</p>
<p><strong>Always charged</strong></p>
<p>One of the smart features is the integrated solar panel, which will convert every beam of sunlight into energy and stores it in the batteries, so you will never have to replace your batteries.</p>
<p>The special batteries hold 75 hours worth of light, which is sufficient for roughly two years of use without sunlight. With only 5 days of sunlight, the batteries are fully charged again and ready for another 2 years of use.</p>
<p>The Rydon Pixio uses the sunlight in the summer to charge the batteries for the winter. Just riding your bike in the summer gives enough energy to get you through the winter. You don’t have to put your bicycle in the sun all the time, you can park it anywhere you want, even in a garage with no light.</p>

<p><strong>Mounting</strong></p>
<p>Installation is very easy with the included special installation tool. The light can be mounted permanently on tube diameters between 10 and 25,4 mm. The included adapter can be used for tube diameters smaller than 16 mm. The included installation tool allows you to mount your Rydon Pixio tightly on your bicycle. The locking mechanism is theft proof. Only with the included tool it is possible to release it. If you buy a new bike in the future, you can use the same special tool to dismount the light and install it again on your new bike.</p>

<p>Cheap disposable bicycle lights use valuable natural resources, such as oils to make plastics and are only used for a limited time.

<p> </p></div>","Rydon Pixio
At Rydon we believe that your bicycle light should always be there, just like your handlebar or saddle. It has to be permanently mounted on your bicycle and should always work, so you never have to worry about it. With this concept in mind we started the development of the Rydon Pixio about 5 years ago. We have designed and tested a lot of ideas until we could fit it all together in one unique product.
We have finished all the production tools and tested the first production samples. We are ready to put the Rydon Pixio on the market.
To produce the lights at a competitive price, we need to order a minimum quantity of 1000 pieces. We will use the earnings from this campaign to produce the lights and build a small stock of lights. Then we will also have the financial means to start marketing activities to make the lights available in the stores.
What's in it for you?
As a backer of our project you will be one of the first to get a your very own Rydon Pixio from the very first production batch and the satisfaction of knowing you were one of the individuals who helped us make the Rydon Pixio a success.
This campaign is a fixed funding campaign, which means we need to reach our goal of 20.000 euro. For backers, this means that you either get a really cool product if we reach this goal, or we refund your money if we don't reach it.
For US customers, the prices are in euro, below is an overview for the prices in  US dollars:
Thanks                € 5   = $ 6
Single                  € 30 = $ 39
Set                     € 55  = $ 73
Set deluxe           € 60  = $ 79
Family pack         € 250 = $ 332
Family deluxe      € 275 = $ 365
Reseller pack      € 777 = $ 1032


Product
The Rydon Pixio contains several unique features:
Always charged
One of the smart features is the integrated solar panel, which will convert every beam of sunlight into energy and stores it in the batteries, so you will never have to replace your batteries.
The special batteries hold 75 hours worth of light, which is sufficient for roughly two years of use without sunlight. With only 5 days of sunlight, the batteries are fully charged again and ready for another 2 years of use.
The Rydon Pixio uses the sunlight in the summer to charge the batteries for the winter. Just riding your bike in the summer gives enough energy to get you through the winter. You don’t have to put your bicycle in the sun all the time, you can park it anywhere you want, even in a garage with no light.

Mounting
Installation is very easy with the included special installation tool. The light can be mounted permanently on tube diameters between 10 and 25,4 mm. The included adapter can be used for tube diameters smaller than 16 mm. The included installation tool allows you to mount your Rydon Pixio tightly on your bicycle. The locking mechanism is theft proof. Only with the included tool it is possible to release it. If you buy a new bike in the future, you can use the same special tool to dismount the light and install it again on your new bike.

<h3>Timeline &amp; Funding

</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>Now that we have our functioning prototype, we will need to have the 
device developed and tested to be ready for large scale production. We 
are currently speaking with manufacturers who are ready to get started, 
but we need the funding to make it happen.</p>
<p>The funds raised during
 this campaign will be put towards fulfilling the shipment of our 
hardware (lids+jars) to our contributors, as well as towards continuing the development of 
the mobile applications. A large portion of the funding will be going 
towards the tooling and development stage of production, which includes 
creating very expensive molds.</p>
<p>On the software side, we have the base functionality down and are already developing the additional features.</p>

</div></div>","The Smart Mason Lid
 Our first product, the Smart Mason Lid, is a patent-pending, custom lid 
for any wide-mouth mason jar. It gives people the ability to track and 
gain insights on the things that they consume with their mason jars. The
 Smart Mason Lid functions as a digital scale with Bluetooth 
connectivity to our 2 mobile applications. Our applications can be used 
for recipes and nutrition, or for legal cannabis.

2 Models

Standard Smart Mason Lid: measures in 1g increments (1g - 2kg). Only works with Recipes & Nutrition application.


Precision Smart Mason Lid: measures in tenth of a gram increments (0.1g - 1kg). Works with both the Cannabis and Nutrition applications.

   Recipes and Nutrition
 Measure the calories and nutrients of the ingredients that are added.
 The Smart Mason app will have access to the nutritional information of 
any ingredient based on its weight. Therefore, users can either input 
the ingredients that they are adding, or they can select a preset 
recipe.You can use the Smart Mason app to create, share, and browse through recipes, while also finding other users to follow.Cannabis
*Can only download in places where legal*
Legal cannabis users can measure, track, and manage their cannabis consumption so that they can engage with their cannabis in the most effective way.


3 Unique Ways to Use the App
Input the quantity and price of the cannabis that you purchased so that 
when you weigh it out you can see the dollar amount and budget your use.
For medical marijuana patients, input your desired effects (i.e. migraine relief, increased appetite, 
etc.), and as you track your consumption, you will be periodically asked
 how you feel. Over time the app will give you recommendations on how to
 optimize your consumption for the best effects.
Receive custom offers from nearby dispensaries when you are running low 
on your supply. The offers will be customized based on the types of 
strains you like, the quantities you like to purchase, and the prices 
you like to pay.








   
Timeline & Funding



Now that we have our functioning prototype, we will need to have the 
device developed and tested to be ready for large scale production. We 
are currently speaking with manufacturers who are ready to get started, 
but we need the funding to make it happen.
The funds raised during
 this campaign will be put towards fulfilling the shipment of our 
hardware (lids+jars) to our contributors, as well as towards continuing the development of 
the mobile applications. A large portion of the funding will be going 
towards the tooling and development stage of production, which includes 
creating very expensive molds.
On the software side, we have the base functionality down and are already developing the additional features.


Our Prototype
 
Our current prototype can measure weight and communicate the weight 
measurements to our mobile applications through Bluetooth. Our 
applications are in the early stages of development.

</div></div>","Knock Lock Box.  and the theft is avoided

What if you could hide your secrets without any password or key, and at the same time using something that doesn't seem an electric device at all!
This is exactly what Knock Lock Box allows you to do. You just need to remember a secret sequence of knocks; knocking this sequence is the only way you can open the box. Once the box is open, you just need to touch the metallic touch sensor on the front of the box and it will close in a second.

Nobody will imagine that your box can do all this. After all, from the outside, it seems just.. a box!


Let's go to details




The case is 100% wood and it's made in Italy

The secret sequence will be given with the box
Batteries are included 
In the final version, there will be a small led that will blink when a knock is sensed by the box. In this way, it will be easier to knock the right sequence.
In the final version there will be a cool mechanism (instead of the blue and ugly actual one) that won't let the box be opened at all without the sequence.
we have decided to keep the box's dimensions small for an issue of usability and price. The exact dimensions are 10cmx10cmx5cm.





 And now some technical details..



The box is Arduino-based. Actually, there is not an Arduino inside the box. This is because there is ATMEGA328p (the Arduino's processor) running all the programs that allow the box to manage the piezo input ( knock sensor ), the capacitive input (touch sensor) and the servo motor ( that let the box open and close).
In this way the costs are massively reduced, as the ATMEGA costs something like 20 times less than an Arduino board. Even if this required a lot of work, now we are proud to afford this low price. Moreover, this solution reduces the power consumption so that the batteries durability is really long-lasting.



The box works lovely, but new features are being developed: an ATTINY84, cheaper and less power-consuming,  will probably replace the current ATMEGA328; a more efficient sleep-mode for the processor is also being developed in order to low down even more the power-consume of the box. (see the ""use of funds""  section*)

Use of Funds

What will the money raised used for? Well, one issue is to finalize the project; this means that there are many marginal aspects that need to be enhanced.
Hardware



""blue-section"" improvement: this is the part that hold the box's lid attached to the motor arm. It will be better designed and produced in series.

the black-bottom of the box will be strengthened.

the motor will be better covered.

Software*


the PCB (printed circuit board) will be produced in series and refined.

a smaller processor will be used in order to low-down price and energy consumption.

a sleep-mode will be better developed in order to have an even more low batteries consumption.

The most of the money raised, anyway, will be used for manufacturing, production tooling and therefore to start effectively the project.
