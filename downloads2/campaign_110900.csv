<p>In my seven years as an oncology (cancer) massage therapist, I have witnessed the cancer journey through the eyes of thousands of amazing courageous souls, those who have beaten cancer and those who have lost their battle.</p>
<p>My name is Catherine Tatum. Six years ago as I was treating a patient, I felt as though God stuck a USB cable into my mind and downloaded this book into my heart. God then sent numerous earth angels and messengers to tell me their stories and speak from their hearts. </p>
<p>It has recently been pressed upon me that the time to share this gift I have been given is NOW.</p>
<p>For the people who are led to this book, my hope is that they find healing, hope, joy and inspiration on the pages to help them navigate whatever challenges they may be facing. They also need to know that they are not alone in their journey.</p>
<p>My other hope is that Touching Cancer can lead readers down the path to health and healing through the research I have been guided to explore and share.</p>
<p>Although Touching Cancer is inspired by the stories of cancer patients, their stories are universal to the human spirit when facing the trials of life, whatever those may be. </p>
<p>At present the book is about two thirds or more complete. This campaign will allow me to self-publish the book (including one-on-one writing mentoring, editing, graphic design and printing) without involving a traditional publisher. It will also give me the ability to market the book effectively to share these insights to give people in all situations, healing, hope and inspiration. The planned launch date is May 2018.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Bonus Perks</h3>
<p>Everyone who helps fund this project will get the perk they choose as well as weekly insights into the campaign, the table of contents and progress of the book until launch. I will also be asking my backers to vote in a book cover contest to help choose the artwork. The book cover I present now is simply a mock up. </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>The biggest challenge with the book has been getting this far. I am certain that this book will be finished by spring next year. I have researched the resources for the completion and have them already lined up. As I stated above, I will be sending updates about the book weekly.</p>

<p>More and more children are becoming self-centered<i>, </i>an attitude diametrically opposing team spirit. To help combat that disjointing attitude, this book is a must read for today's youth!<i> Gary &amp; a Box of Salt</i> is an autobiographical narrative of an event based on a young boy, with a loving heart, that gave a box of salt to help feed the poor within his community. This book brings to life the subject of altruism coupled with the compassion to give.  <br/></p>
<p>       Can you remember back in the day when life was much simpler than it is now? Eating home-grown fruits and vegetables, playing out-of-doors, and working and teaming up together in the community to help meet each others daily needs <i>‒‒</i>that was what we did, and it was common practice! Today, the word “team” is a</p>

<p>highly effective business term used by major companies; but now, unfortunately, used less by families. In publishing <i>Gary &amp; a Box of Salt,</i> I’m going old school! Through my warm and insightful book, I’m attempting to bring back the functionality of teamwork in families and community and to reveal the necessity and importance of reestablishing it in the lives of today’s children. <br/></p>
<p>       Often, the first step toward self-help begins by helping someone else, an insight and behavior that should start at home. Children will discover within this delightful picture book just how Gary and his entire family benefited from his enthusiastic act</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439187493/g4hszghqebivlvb5zmbr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><i>They gave the box to my mother. ""Is that a poor family's box of food,"" I wondered? I did not think that my family was looked upon as being poor...</i><br/></p>of kindness when he donated a box of salt to help feed the poor! Within this book, children will find various life scenarios showing them realistic and attainable outcomes from positive goal setting. Adults will appreciate it as a transitional ice-breaking tool, making it easier to engage youngsters in constructive dialog about the benefits of making good life choices based on topics found within it---And that one point alone substantiates why every parent needs to own at least two copies of this book…<i>Your friends will want to take a copy home with them.</i> <br/><p></p>

I spent over 25 years working in the graphic art field and as the principal of <i>Lett’s Do Art, </i>a graphic art firm<i>;</i> directed and taught art for various children art programs in San Antonio, Texas, and I am a licensed minister.

More and more children are becoming self-centered, an attitude diametrically opposing team spirit. To help combat that disjointing attitude, this book is a must read for today's youth! Gary & a Box of Salt is an autobiographical narrative of an event based on a young boy, with a loving heart, that gave a box of salt to help feed the poor within his community. This book brings to life the subject of altruism coupled with the compassion to give.  
       Can you remember back in the day when life was much simpler than it is now? Eating home-grown fruits and vegetables, playing out-of-doors, and working and teaming up together in the community to help meet each others daily needs ‒‒that was what we did, and it was common practice! Today, the word “team” is a
When I walked into the pantry the shelves would have been completely bare, if not for a lonely box of salt, that's all that was there!
highly effective business term used by major companies; but now, unfortunately, used less by families. In publishing Gary & a Box of Salt, I’m going old school! Through my warm and insightful book, I’m attempting to bring back the functionality of teamwork in families and community and to reveal the necessity and importance of reestablishing it in the lives of today’s children. 
       Often, the first step toward self-help begins by helping someone else, an insight and behavior that should start at home. Children will discover within this delightful picture book just how Gary and his entire family benefited from his enthusiastic act

They gave the box to my mother. ""Is that a poor family's box of food,"" I wondered? I did not think that my family was looked upon as being poor...of kindness when he donated a box of salt to help feed the poor! Within this book, children will find various life scenarios showing them realistic and attainable outcomes from positive goal setting. Adults will appreciate it as a transitional ice-breaking tool, making it easier to engage youngsters in constructive dialog about the benefits of making good life choices based on topics found within it---And that one point alone substantiates why every parent needs to own at least two copies of this book…Your friends will want to take a copy home with them.

</div></div>","Hi All! 

The renewed Fabayo.com website took off recently with its regular updates!:)
Now you are MOST WELCOME to visit it!
Please, send me your comments, wishes and advises!

Big Thanks to all our supporters! 
The message is still on and we continue to raise money for a great new
Fabayo.com website. 

Anyone who wishes to support this project further can do so by donating on the actual website http://fabayo.com 



What is Fabayo.com?

When you think of the Future what do you see in your mind’s eye?
I see advancing Technology and Science in harmony with Nature.
Sure, it is just one of many roads humanity can take..
But let me be a little optimistic. 
And let me tell you about Fabayo.com, the news website that I am running. 
http://fabayo.com
Actually, for the moment, with its basic design and without new updates - it is more of a sketch, an idea, if you like.
But.
Its potential is vast. It is aiming to be a powerful and fascinating website.
In fact - Fabayo can make a difference.





Why is Fabayo.com different from other news websites?


First of all let me briefly describe how it works. 
It is simple in its principle.
I am looking for the most revolutionary news on major processes happening on Earth and in the Cosmos (in terms of what is uncovered for us), then I place links to the relevant articles on Fabayo.com and invite you to read them on exceptional scientific, environmental and techno websites and blogs.
And let me make a little remark here, - I am NOT promoting anyone. My choice of the websites and blogs that I am referring to is unengaged, intuitive, objective and always open.
By revolutionary news I mean news that constitutes a turning point, news that are a catalyst for the Future. News that transfigures Science, Technology, Environment, Cosmology and what we know about ourselves as Humans, or news that simply awes us, like, for instance, a photo of a new nebula... News to enable this and future generations to see the big picture, to generalize and to be inspired. 
I think you would agree that to stand on the the shoulders of a giant versus standing on the ground reveals a very different perspective.
I believe one day Fabayo.com can one day become this giant. 


   Where your contribution is going



As I already mentioned, at the moment Fabayo.com has a basic design. 
Being an amateur in website building, I've modified a free template that was initially created for blogs and not for news websites. 
To transform Fabayo into a full power informational website I need funding:
 1. To change its design with the help of a professional web designer. 
 2. To have a special program written by a web developer for adding news links in one click. Right now the links adding process takes far too much time - from 15 to 25 min, this also includes adding tags, keyword for All in one SEO pack and new words for the search engine and excludes a selective search for these news links. I've made inquiries and one of the developers agreed to write this program for 2000$.
 3. To add a new feature ( I hope this will come with a new design and will not cost a lot) that would stretch Fabayo's boundaries so that the people who enjoy visiting it could also take part in searching and adding new links.
 4. For a consultation and eventual help from a Search Engine Optimizer. 
If I don't reach my goal of 3500$ then at least I can start few processes about transforming Fabayo and will continue to search for investments.
 Once again - any ideas from you would be greatly appreciated!!

What qualifies me to run a website like this and what are my challenges  





I have a degree in psychology and other qualifications but that's not what enables me to manage Fabayo and nurture it into something big.
What really qualifies me is:
- I am fascinated by the advancing technology of our time and am convinced that in future it will even exceed our expectations.
- Science is almost my religion.
- Earth is my home. Its issues are my issues and its joys, - like renewables, carbon cuts, eco living, aware people, are my joys.
- My heart sinks every time I have to throw out a plastic bag in a country that does not recycle.
- And.. I have a feeling for the Future. 
It is something very subtle...Possibilities that are both existing and non-existing at the same time..
The main challenge is - I am parenting alone, my son is only 2,5 and he would always be the first in line for my attention. That's why I need tools for managing Fabayo in a fast, efficient manner and attract more people into helping me. 
In future I envisage a talented team working with me on Fabayo.com




Global project



I've chosen the Republic of Ireland as my launch country because my official address and bank account are there. I had started to create Fabayo in Malaysia and currently I am in Ukraine. 
However, Fabayo does not belong to any country - it is a worldwide project.
I look out for news from different corners of the Earth and also try to use websites and blogs from different countries, even though my choice is limited to English language news sources.
Recently I've read that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels hit a record of 400 ppm. That's the highest level ever recorded..   
We really have no choice but to raise our awareness from local to global and start to take care.. 

The Earth is our home. 
If we start to think and act like that - many issues mankind is facing today will eventually vanish.

<p>Since 2014, I've dedicated exclusively to writing and I've published two novels since then  (Inertia - 2014 and Cat's Pajamas - 2015), one of those is being translated to English at the moment and will be soon published in that language. </p>
<p>I'm working on my next novel called <b>Men Will Never Know Any Of This</b> that will hopefully be published by December, 2015. For this new novel I thought about releasing a new and different format and launch, simultaneously, an extras book. This extras book will work as an extras dvd, with illustrations, collages, paintings, photography and music that recreates the character's lives, relationships and events depicted in Men Will Never Know Any Of This. The book will be bilingual (Portuguese and English).</p>
<p>I've been authorized by Michael Zanger to use his Mount Shasta's sunrise image (the cover for this crowfund) that will be featured on the novel's cover, since it has a relevant symbolism in the plot. </p>

<br/><p>The title of this novel was the title of a handmade book my father did when he was in his early twenties with poems and photographs he took. <b>I grew up reading this book and his personal wanderings so it's important for me to keep the title</b>. I will also have an illustration made over this picture, similar to my father's book cover and related to the main characters of the novel. </p>

<br/>
<p>The contributions will be essential for the acquisition for most of the works ordered, since I'm contacting a lot of different artists from different countries and artistic backgrounds.  I'm also trying to choose artists with different styles, so the perspectives will be broader. Besides the paintings (oil on canvas), drawings and illustrations, I'm also contacting musicians to create an album with a few songs that will recreate the main character's album (Ian is a guitar player in 1969, with a big Led Zeppelin influence).</p>
<p>Both books (the novel and the extras book) will also be published in english (the date is not available yet), by self-published edition or by a publisher.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Artists involved</h3> <p>I made an estimated 5000€ contribution, since most artists charge between 100€ to 500€ (and more symbolic budgets from personal connections) and I'm contacting around 20 artists, plus the musicians. </p>
<p>Until now, I have 18 different artists confirmed.</p>
<p>From the Portuguese artists, I have confirmed and that are <b>ALREADY WORKING </b>(<b>note, the images below are examples of their work, not the images for the book</b> ):</p>

Read in English: I'm an author from Portugal, here you have my website: www.thepatr.com
Since 2014, I've dedicated exclusively to writing and I've published two novels since then  (Inertia - 2014 and Cat's Pajamas - 2015), one of those is being translated to English at the moment and will be soon published in that language. 
I'm working on my next novel called Men Will Never Know Any Of This that will hopefully be published by December, 2015. For this new novel I thought about releasing a new and different format and launch, simultaneously, an extras book. This extras book will work as an extras dvd, with illustrations, collages, paintings, photography and music that recreates the character's lives, relationships and events depicted in Men Will Never Know Any Of This. The book will be bilingual (Portuguese and English).
I've been authorized by Michael Zanger to use his Mount Shasta's sunrise image (the cover for this crowfund) that will be featured on the novel's cover, since it has a relevant symbolism in the plot. 


The title of this novel was the title of a handmade book my father did when he was in his early twenties with poems and photographs he took. I grew up reading this book and his personal wanderings so it's important for me to keep the title. I will also have an illustration made over this picture, similar to my father's book cover and related to the main characters of the novel. 



The contributions will be essential for the acquisition for most of the works ordered, since I'm contacting a lot of different artists from different countries and artistic backgrounds.  I'm also trying to choose artists with different styles, so the perspectives will be broader. Besides the paintings (oil on canvas), drawings and illustrations, I'm also contacting musicians to create an album with a few songs that will recreate the main character's album (Ian is a guitar player in 1969, with a big Led Zeppelin influence).
Both books (the novel and the extras book) will also be published in english (the date is not available yet), by self-published edition or by a publisher.   Artists involved I made an estimated 5000€ contribution, since most artists charge between 100€ to 500€ (and more symbolic budgets from personal connections) and I'm contacting around 20 artists, plus the musicians. 
Until now, I have 18 different artists confirmed.
From the Portuguese artists, I have confirmed and that are ALREADY WORKING (note, the images below are examples of their work, not the images for the book ):
Ana Luís Quintão


Sara Feio

Pedro Lourenço


Zé Pereira


Tiago Dinis


Vanessa Neves

<p>The popularity seeker— Thomas

<p>The heart of gold — Henry doesn’t

<p></p>
<p>Wartune is making its literary
debut!</p>
<p>After three years of epic RPG action
we’ve decided that it’s time to give the story a little more oomph. You probably
know the basics: slay the dragon, power up the Eudaemon, and become super powerful, but
it’s time we added a little more depth to all this. A little more romance, a little more
heart-wrenching sorrow, a little more oo-lala. We’re going to explain why
you’re building the most powerful city in the world, and who you were before.
We want you to know where the evil has come from, and why the goddess must stop
it. We want you to understand the true hero you’ve become. There’s so much more
to the Wartune universe than just click and kill, and we want to share it with
you.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Unfortunately while we have a great
story to tell, none of us on the Wartune team are novelists. We don’t have the
skills to create the beautiful epic that Wartune deserves. So in order to accomplish this fantastic
endeavour we need your support!</p>

<h1>The Novel</h1>
<p>The young prince, once had
everything - a life people envied, doting parents, a caring master, and a
bright future that only come with being the son of King Ferrero. Those times have
been forgotten, swept away by tragedy and war. A war driven and dictated by the
whims of one man. No, not a man.</p>
<p>A god.</p>
<p>Knight crusader Yannick, the prince's
master and friend, is charged with making him a man worthy of his father's
throne. The boy only needs time - time to heal, time to live. But will humanity
endure that long?</p>
<p>A chilling prophecy drives the
rapidly turning wheel of events fed by the greed and thirst for power of one
god. Where would Earth's salvation come from? The forgotten Prince or the
seasoned warrior Alkorn? Will humanity survive?</p>

Wartune
5.2 has launched.
We've
optimized a bunch of systems, and added some new systems. 
Enjoy!

About the Project

Wartune is making its literary
debut!
After three years of epic RPG action
we’ve decided that it’s time to give the story a little more oomph. You probably
know the basics: slay the dragon, power up the Eudaemon, and become super powerful, but
it’s time we added a little more depth to all this. A little more romance, a little more
heart-wrenching sorrow, a little more oo-lala. We’re going to explain why
you’re building the most powerful city in the world, and who you were before.
We want you to know where the evil has come from, and why the goddess must stop
it. We want you to understand the true hero you’ve become. There’s so much more
to the Wartune universe than just click and kill, and we want to share it with
you.



Unfortunately while we have a great
story to tell, none of us on the Wartune team are novelists. We don’t have the
skills to create the beautiful epic that Wartune deserves. So in order to accomplish this fantastic
endeavour we need your support!




The Novel
The young prince, once had
everything - a life people envied, doting parents, a caring master, and a
bright future that only come with being the son of King Ferrero. Those times have
been forgotten, swept away by tragedy and war. A war driven and dictated by the
whims of one man. No, not a man.
A god.
Knight crusader Yannick, the prince's
master and friend, is charged with making him a man worthy of his father's
throne. The boy only needs time - time to heal, time to live. But will humanity
endure that long?
A chilling prophecy drives the
rapidly turning wheel of events fed by the greed and thirst for power of one
god. Where would Earth's salvation come from? The forgotten Prince or the
seasoned warrior Alkorn? Will humanity survive?





The Author
Chioma
Osifo is an author and teacher. She was inspired by David Gemmell, the
bestselling British fantasy writer, to begin her craft. Her years of
experience writing novels, biographies and memoirs have allowed her to move far
beyond her background in physiology.
When
approached about writing the novel, Chioma quickly offered up an incredible
outline and was awarded the privilege because of her enthusiasm and unique
style. She is excited to channel her creative talents and experience garnered
from writing novels like Regrets, and A Circle, and to take up the challenge of
creating compelling characters and a hero fans will resonate with.




Never played Wartune?
Not a problem! There will still be plenty to
enjoy in this epic fantasy novel, and everything you need to know is:
Wartune is a 2.5D real-time RPG + Strategic
browser game that uses 3D rendered 2D technology so players can enjoy the
maximum visual experience. It received Facebook's Top Asian Game Award in 2014,

strengthen their main character, who then proceeds to complete nigh-impossible

It is real and untouched. <i>Made of the Light Stuff</i>  is a true story that began its journey during my recovery from the physical and emotional impact of a near death experience, (NDE) brought on by meningitis. My recovery was complicated by the fact that I was trying to understand the apparent incredibility of what I’d experienced during my NDE; I wanted to tell people but was afraid of ridicule, and even though I knew what I had seen was more real than anything I had ever experienced in my life, I didn’t want it reduced to another person's pathetic attempt at explaining away the unexplainable.</p>
<p>Prior to my NDE, I had not been a particularly religious person or believed in reincarnation, and though I have always believed in something, I wasn't quite sure what it actually was. Whenever things went awry, I prayed to a God I wasn’t even sure existed, and nothing I was taught in respect to religion had ever seemed plausible or able to answer any of my questions. The God I learned about always seemed absent in my times of need, and unfortunately, my life has contained a fair amount of trauma and struggle.</p>
<p>Recounting my NDE experience regularly reduces me to tears and it has been a difficult subject for me to either write about, or speak of openly. This is mainly because it's quite challenging to find the correct language to describe an NDE in any way that does it justice – the words in our human language do not exist to describe what it's like when we are no longer human! I am also aware that writing of my experience carries a great sense of responsibility to describe the event as accurately and clearly as possible. </p>

<h3>About The Book</h3>
<p>For the past 6 years or so I have gathered information about all the Western Australian Alternative bands through the years 1976~1989.  Along the way I have met and interviewed many musicians of the day and was allowed to go through boxes of archives of tapes, cassettes, posters, flyers and much much more. It covers all the name bands that made it and all the bands that didn't.  They are all in here.</p>
<p>The idea of putting it all into a book for all of us to share came after I realised that all these great archives need to be in one place.  Yea, there's the internet but its not the same as holding a nice physical book while lounging back and listening to some music of the period.</p>
<p>Perth in the late 70s until 1989 was a hotbed of fantastic original groups with many going under the radar.  So my job is to bring all these goodies and great memories back to you so you can reminisce with your family and friends.  You can show your kids all weirdos you hung out with and watch them get embarrassed :)</p>
<p>Included is a  CD which will have many previously released and unreleased tracks from the period as well.  The music will knock you out and will surely impress.  Its worth the price alone.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p>I am close to finishing up and I have decided to put this book up for CROWD FUNDING. The reason for this is to help me determine how many colour pages go inside or not.  The more the better but the more it has the more expensive it will be to print and it will also determine how many books get printed.  Hopefully it goes beyond my expectations.</p>
<p>If I meet the Crowd Funding I need then that's cool - If I don't, then less colour pages it will have but it will still maintain a high quality look and content.</p>
<p>After the CROWD FUND is ended, you can still purchase the book through this page as this will then serve as a pre order, It more or less does already.</p>
<p>Tell you friends and help get this 6 year project in the making, done and dusted.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>What Funds Do You Need To Finish This Book?</h3>
<p>The target of $10,000 breaks down into the following:</p>
<p>Direct Book Production and Funding Expenses: $8,000</p>
<p>Includes: Editing, Indiegogo-related fees, Book printing and taxes.</p>
<p>CD mastering, manufacturing and packaging: $2000</p>
</div><div>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>What Will I Get For My Contribution?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The main gift you will receive is the satisfaction that comes with being a part of this important book project that you can treasure and hand down to future generations.  I'm sure a lot of you that order the book are within the pages and that would be a great thing to show your family as well wouldn't it?</p>
<p>I am offering some great deals to allow you to experience some of this unique decade with me. For each pledge level (ranging from $20 to $50), you will get the items at a Pre Order CROWD FUND discounted price and includes a personal thank you (in the book only) signed by me. </p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b>  The CD is exclusive to this campaign only - The CD will NOT be available in shops and only the book will be available at some book stores (if any remain after this campaign) but the RRP will be much higher than $50.</p>
<p>If the entire amount is not funded, I will still use the reached funds as planned to ensure that the book gets published. As I mentioned above the colour content is on the line here - so the closer to my goal the more colour gets onto the pages.</p> </div> <div> <h3>

For the past 6 years or so I have gathered information about all the Western Australian Alternative bands through the years 1976~1989.  Along the way I have met and interviewed many musicians of the day and was allowed to go through boxes of archives of tapes, cassettes, posters, flyers and much much more. It covers all the name bands that made it and all the bands that didn't.  They are all in here.
The idea of putting it all into a book for all of us to share came after I realised that all these great archives need to be in one place.  Yea, there's the internet but its not the same as holding a nice physical book while lounging back and listening to some music of the period.
Perth in the late 70s until 1989 was a hotbed of fantastic original groups with many going under the radar.  So my job is to bring all these goodies and great memories back to you so you can reminisce with your family and friends.  You can show your kids all weirdos you hung out with and watch them get embarrassed :)
Included is a  CD which will have many previously released and unreleased tracks from the period as well.  The music will knock you out and will surely impress.  Its worth the price alone.
Short Summary 
I am close to finishing up and I have decided to put this book up for CROWD FUNDING. The reason for this is to help me determine how many colour pages go inside or not.  The more the better but the more it has the more expensive it will be to print and it will also determine how many books get printed.  Hopefully it goes beyond my expectations.
If I meet the Crowd Funding I need then that's cool - If I don't, then less colour pages it will have but it will still maintain a high quality look and content.
After the CROWD FUND is ended, you can still purchase the book through this page as this will then serve as a pre order, It more or less does already.
Tell you friends and help get this 6 year project in the making, done and dusted.
   
What Funds Do You Need To Finish This Book?
The target of $10,000 breaks down into the following:
Direct Book Production and Funding Expenses: $8,000
Includes: Editing, Indiegogo-related fees, Book printing and taxes.
CD mastering, manufacturing and packaging: $2000


What Will I Get For My Contribution?

The main gift you will receive is the satisfaction that comes with being a part of this important book project that you can treasure and hand down to future generations.  I'm sure a lot of you that order the book are within the pages and that would be a great thing to show your family as well wouldn't it?
I am offering some great deals to allow you to experience some of this unique decade with me. For each pledge level (ranging from $20 to $50), you will get the items at a Pre Order CROWD FUND discounted price and includes a personal thank you (in the book only) signed by me. 
NOTE:  The CD is exclusive to this campaign only - The CD will NOT be available in shops and only the book will be available at some book stores (if any remain after this campaign) but the RRP will be much higher than $50.
If the entire amount is not funded, I will still use the reached funds as planned to ensure that the book gets published. As I mentioned above the colour content is on the line here - so the closer to my goal the more colour gets onto the pages.

<p><br/></p>
<br/><p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>My name is Njomza (Ney-omza, it means ""Blossom"" in Albanian) and I am a child of war. When I was five years old my country was invaded and my parents and three siblings were forced out of our peaceful village. In the following months I was shot at, survived a death train, watched my father being beaten and shot as he tried unsuccessfully to prevent me from being abducted. And that's just the beginning. We eventually made it to the USA and I began the long, painful journey to recovery but not without going through the Second War that many refugee children face -- horrendous bullying, abuse, hardship, PTSD and depression. Just leaving a conflict zone and coming to the USA wasn't enough. It was  a very hard adaptation to life in a very generous but nonetheless foreign country. But I have found the answers, through my own experience, extensive study and some amazing mentoring, and these are shared in my book. </p>
<br/><p>Now I am on a mission to raise awareness about children of war, what they face on the battlefields, and what they need  not just to survive but thrive. Please come and join me to make my dream a reality. Save a child and turn a refugee into a hero, a survivor into a contributor.</p>
<br/><p>Refugee children of war are a critical issue. As I write this, there are wars going on in different parts of the world affecting many, many children with no end in sight. In fact, there are an estimated two million childhood war refugees from Syria alone. Some of these children are orphaned and those lucky enough to have families have parents and siblings scarred by horror and experiencing PTSD.  It's one thing to give food, shelter and water but those are short-term solutions. What about the future of these children? We can help them not only survive but thrive in the long term.</p>
<br/><p>This is a global issue. Those lucky enough to escape zones of conflict can end up in many different countries all around the world. There are children in your classrooms, neighbors on your street, and people struggling in your countries who can be helped to overcome the trauma of a destroyed childhood.</p>
<br/><p><b>Where Does the Money Go?</b></p>
<p>My book Blossom: Confessions of a Child of War is a start. I want it to be a platform that will raise awareness of the child refugee cause. The money will go to finalizing the book and promotion which will hopefully then provide a platform for support,  information and services for those in need and those trying to help children of war. These scarred and battered children may seem like lost refugees but I believe that inside many of them are scientists, poets, writers,  doctors, nurses and healers -- if we can only give them the chance. We need to give them the real opportunity to recover from trauma and develop their gifts: to blossom. They did not ask for the horrors that they have endured.</p>
<br/><p><b>Impact</b></p>
<p>By supporting my book project and helping me spread awareness about how to really serve the long term needs of war-affected children, you will not just be helping this child of war but potentially thousands and thousands of child war refugees. These people need all the help they can get. They have lost everything -- their homes, their childhood, any sense of stability. If you go online you can see the photos: destroyed parents holding up photos of lost children,  pre-teens with mangled bodies, toddlers lying besides the graves of their parents and siblings. Believe me, I'm not being melodramatic. I've been there. There are ways of preventing the horrors of their childhood becoming their predominant life theme. </p>
<br/><p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<p>There will no doubt be challenges but one of the things that I have learned about childhood war survivors -- we're a resilient bunch. Just give me a chance and I will do everything I can to promote this cause. You see, I will always first and foremost be a child of war and I know what that means. I also know what it takes to use those experiences and turn them into a life passion and a force for the most noble profession -- helping others. I also have an outstanding team of caring professionals who can help raise awareness of my book and the bigger issues it raises,.</p>
<br/><p><b>Other Ways to Help</b></p>
<p>Please help me build my platform by promoting this book. Whether you can donate money or not, please spread the word via your network.  There are millions of children suffering and your efforts might help turn someone like me, from a traumatized kidnapped lost 5 year-old into an author, healer and, I hope, inspiration. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>

My name is Njomza (Ney-omza, it means ""Blossom"" in Albanian) and I am a child of war. When I was five years old my country was invaded and my parents and three siblings were forced out of our peaceful village. In the following months I was shot at, survived a death train, watched my father being beaten and shot as he tried unsuccessfully to prevent me from being abducted. And that's just the beginning. We eventually made it to the USA and I began the long, painful journey to recovery but not without going through the Second War that many refugee children face -- horrendous bullying, abuse, hardship, PTSD and depression. Just leaving a conflict zone and coming to the USA wasn't enough. It was  a very hard adaptation to life in a very generous but nonetheless foreign country. But I have found the answers, through my own experience, extensive study and some amazing mentoring, and these are shared in my book. 
Now I am on a mission to raise awareness about children of war, what they face on the battlefields, and what they need  not just to survive but thrive. Please come and join me to make my dream a reality. Save a child and turn a refugee into a hero, a survivor into a contributor.
Refugee children of war are a critical issue. As I write this, there are wars going on in different parts of the world affecting many, many children with no end in sight. In fact, there are an estimated two million childhood war refugees from Syria alone. Some of these children are orphaned and those lucky enough to have families have parents and siblings scarred by horror and experiencing PTSD.  It's one thing to give food, shelter and water but those are short-term solutions. What about the future of these children? We can help them not only survive but thrive in the long term.
This is a global issue. Those lucky enough to escape zones of conflict can end up in many different countries all around the world. There are children in your classrooms, neighbors on your street, and people struggling in your countries who can be helped to overcome the trauma of a destroyed childhood.
Where Does the Money Go?
My book Blossom: Confessions of a Child of War is a start. I want it to be a platform that will raise awareness of the child refugee cause. The money will go to finalizing the book and promotion which will hopefully then provide a platform for support,  information and services for those in need and those trying to help children of war. These scarred and battered children may seem like lost refugees but I believe that inside many of them are scientists, poets, writers,  doctors, nurses and healers -- if we can only give them the chance. We need to give them the real opportunity to recover from trauma and develop their gifts: to blossom. They did not ask for the horrors that they have endured.
Impact
By supporting my book project and helping me spread awareness about how to really serve the long term needs of war-affected children, you will not just be helping this child of war but potentially thousands and thousands of child war refugees. These people need all the help they can get. They have lost everything -- their homes, their childhood, any sense of stability. If you go online you can see the photos: destroyed parents holding up photos of lost children,  pre-teens with mangled bodies, toddlers lying besides the graves of their parents and siblings. Believe me, I'm not being melodramatic. I've been there. There are ways of preventing the horrors of their childhood becoming their predominant life theme. 
Challenges
There will no doubt be challenges but one of the things that I have learned about childhood war survivors -- we're a resilient bunch. Just give me a chance and I will do everything I can to promote this cause. You see, I will always first and foremost be a child of war and I know what that means. I also know what it takes to use those experiences and turn them into a life passion and a force for the most noble profession -- helping others. I also have an outstanding team of caring professionals who can help raise awareness of my book and the bigger issues it raises,.
Other Ways to Help
Please help me build my platform by promoting this book. Whether you can donate money or not, please spread the word via your network.  There are millions of children suffering and your efforts might help turn someone like me, from a traumatized kidnapped lost 5 year-old into an author, healer and, I hope, inspiration. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

<h3>Hi, there!</h3>
<p>I’m a full time vanlifer, street performer, and YOUR bubble lady! I've been traveling around for the past two years, popping up in public spaces to share bubble playtime with everyone!</p>
<p>Now, I've compiled all of my best ""secrets"" to wonder-filled bubble playtime (including my giant bubble recipe) in a handmade zine! I wrote and illustrated the whole darn thing and I think you're going to LOVE it!</p>
<p>The funds raised from this campaign will go to essential repairs to my van-home, so I can keep bubbling! This campaign will also help me weather the storm of social-distancing and quarantine.</p>

<h3>The Bad (sort of)</h3>
<p>My van is an air-cooled 1982 Volkswagen Vanagon Westfalia BABE. Her body is in great shape and she's almost completely original! This gives her +100 cool points, but -75 safety points. I have driven her slowly and gently always, but now her (near 40 year old!) parts are showing signs of wear that mean imminent danger (or total engine failure) if I don't get them fixed soon!</p>
<p>My van's woes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Her engine is leaking oil at a rate that makes any kind of distance driving dangerous, because she'll nearly run dry between gas stations. This causes her engine to overheat, which could cause my engine to catch on fire! A host of curious (and dangerous) engine problems has my mechanic recommending a full replacement of her engine.</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Leaking transmission fluid! And a terrible problem with her differential which needs to be addressed so that I don't lose control while driving.</span></li>
<li><font>Basically every part of her suspension needs to be replaced, including tie rods, ball joints, springs and shocks. I'm safe for the moment, but the warning cracks and signs are signaling to my mechanic that the clock is ticking on this issue!</font></li>
<li><font>I also want to take this opportunity to address a few other safety issues, including replacing the spare tire, fixing my currently non-functioning emergency brake, and upgrading to LED lights for increased nighttime visibility.</font></li>
</ul>
<h3>MORE GOOD!</h3>
<p><font>I have an amazing mechanic that I know and trust and has done great, thoughtful work for me in the past. Doing all of this work at ONCE will save me so much time and money! This work will keep me rolling SAFELY! And I have friends who've already offered me a place to stay while my van spends six weeks in surgery!</font></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Unknown</h3>
<p>My mechanic won't know the extent of the transmission problems until he has already opened it up, so I might have to wait on some optional safety upgrades and preventative maintenance. However, if I meet my goal, I will definitely be able to cover the cost of repairs!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know everyone can't contribute financially, but these are other ways you can help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Share! Social media shares are so helpful, hooray!!</li>
<li>Speak to one (or ten) people *directly* about my campaign! People are much more likely to respond to your personal, direct message than a public post.</li>
</ul>
</div><h2>THANK YOU SO MUCH!</h2><p>As I made the promotional video for this indiegogo campaign, I went through years worth of candid phone pictures and videos I've collected. Let me tell you the truth right here, right now... I UGLY CRIED WITH THE OVERWHELM OF LOVE IN MY HEART! YOU all have shown up in the biggest, realest, most magical ways and made bubbling everything that it is. I literally couldn't do this without you. Thank you for inspiring me with hope for humanity.

<h3>Toad Springs #2: <i>Moonshine, Mushrooms, and a Girl Called Bob</i>
</h3>
<p>In 2013, indie publisher <a href=""http://greygeckopress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: blue;"">Grey Gecko Press</a> released a whimsical, homespun and charming short story anthology by Susan Adger about a small Florida town called Toad Springs, set in the 1930s. Readers immediately fell in love with the down-home feel of <a href=""http://books2read.com/toadsprings1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: blue;""><i>Seashells, Gator Bones, and the Church of Everlasting Liability</i></a>, and this humorous and often all-too-relatable collection of stories has since brightened hundreds of homes and bookshelves.</p>
<p>Now Susan is back with the next set of tales from Toad Springs! The new book is jam-packed with even more witticisms, craziness, and henna hair dye than you can shake a stick at! All your favorite characters make their appearances in all the ways you expect, and all-new characters introduce themselves, expanding the circle of stories.</p>
<p>Written with the wit and charm that can only come from living through these stories, Tampa Bay-area resident Susan Adger brings us back to the 1930s in 'country' Florida!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Grey Gecko Press, like most small presses, operates on a small budget, and we need your help to make the biggest splash we can for these new stories! We're setting an initial fundraising goal of just $2,500 - and here's how we'll split that up:</p>
<ul>
<li>$250: Cover art for the new book</li>
<li>$105: Copyright, print setup</li>
<li>$600: Professional 3-stage editing</li>
<li>$1,300: Printing costs for pledge fulfillment</li>
<li>$245: Indiegogo and miscellaneous fees</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Pledges earn lots of great perks and rewards!</p>
<ul>
<li>Trade paperback and hardcover editions of <i><strong>Moonshine &amp; Mushrooms</strong></i>
</li>
<li>eBook bundles from Grey Gecko Press (including our full 45-book catalog!)</li>
<li>Trade paperback and hardcover editions of <i><strong>Seashells &amp; Gator Bones</strong></i>
</li>
<li>New cover art for <i><strong>Seashells &amp; Gator Bones</strong> </i>(Stretch Goal #1)</li>
<li>Trade paperback and hardcover editions of <strong><i>The Toad Springs Omnibus</i></strong> (working title, Stretch Goals #2 &amp; 3)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>As with any campaign, our main risk is not reaching our full funding goal. We're mitigating that risk by progressing with the project in stages, as we meet each funding goal. For example: once we've raised $600, we'll get our editors to work turning the manuscript into a polished gem. With the next $250, we'll commission artwork for the new book, using the website DesignCrowd.com - a site we've used to great positive effect in the past with other projects. Then it's on copyrights, print setup, and the printing costs (by far the largest portion).</p>
<p>This "" progress"" prevents us from getting a 'half-finished' project and instead allows us to manage both our goals and use the generated funds in the most efficient and effective fashion.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even the smallest amount helps, but we also know that times are hard for everyone out there, and as we say in our Gecko family: family comes first. <strong>But you can still help!</strong> Just mash that Share button, talk to your friends, let as many people as you can know that we've got a great book to show them, we just need a little help to get it across the finish line.</p>

<h3>Mockingbird Publishing is launching a new book in tough times</h3> <p>With the start of this year, we were honored to be chosen by a group of writers to publish this anthology.  <i><strong>Cin Sado Noir</strong></i> marks our entry to publishing in the area of Arts and Culture.  The book is a wonderful fit for us.  This book allows us to do what we have always done, both through our <a href=""http://www.mockingbirdpaper.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">flagship periodical</a> and our <a href=""https://mockingbirdpublishing.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">book publishing arm</a>, which is bring unique perspectives and under reported facts to broad conversations about key issues facing our global society.</p>
<p>Discussion of  sexuality and sadomasochism, though taboo, is something touches every life on Earth, with the exception of single cellular life forms, who also do not read. By launching this book, we hope to bring unique perspectives and context to a broad audience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Help we are asking for:</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise  $5000 in order to finance a marketing blitz over the next two months.</p>
<p>In the publishing industry, the profile of any book is often set within the first couple of weeks of it's initial release to the general public.  That profile is raised and expanded through marketing to industry insiders in order to get book buyers to notice a publication.</p>
<p>Small independent booksellers and large wholesalers have many titles competing for their attention and stocking.  For the bibliophile and the casual book consumer alike, there is great competition, both by established industry gatekeepers and through algorithms for attention.</p>
<p>We are asking you for a small leg up on this project.  Through our intensive study and publishing on the intelligence community we are no strangers to information warfare. As alternative media a commitment to waging that struggle asymmetrically was part of our inception.</p>
<p>On May 10th, the book will be released to the broadest possible audience.  We want to reach that date with a great deal of buzz generated. </p>
<p>To this end we have books in stock, which are one of the perks you can receive with a donation. We also have T-shirts featuring art from the book and condoms with the same art on the wrapper as items that you can wear proudly to generate conversation about this book.</p>
<p>A $10 contribution will get you a condom mailed to you at the address you provide.</p>
<p>We have books in stock and we sell them for $24.95 on our website now. However a contribution of $30 will get you both a copy of the book and a condom (while supplies last on the latter) at the address you provide.</p>
<p>A $60 contribution will get you 1 book, 1 condom and 1 T-shirt (again while supplies last). Please specify men's or women's t-shirts and size.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How your help in turn helps us:</h3>
<p>Mockingbird Publishing has taken unique looks at under-reported stories and under-discussed topics for 6 years now.</p>
<p>This little bit of help is a big boost to us.  It also allows us to give you a physical item (like the book) that you can show or wear (like the shirts or condom).</p>
<p>The are many films in many languages that are reviewed and discussed in this anthology. Armed with this new knowledge, you have new ways to explore your desires, and discuss them with a friend or friends.</p>
<p>This is a book of conversations. Our aim is to stimulate more stimulating conversation. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>This is a new challenge for us</h3>
<p>Publishing is a small world dominated by giants.  With this book, Mockingbird now launched 5 titles in 6 years.  However we are still a David in a world of tall men in armor.</p>
<p>There is a chance that despite your help, this may not be the sling bullet that strikes home.  But that does not decrease our faith or determination.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>Even if you were not sufficiently stimulated by the government recently or every condom you come into the possession of is not going to be the topic of a long conversation, there are ways you can help us:</p>
<p>Share this fundraiser.  Somebody you know wants to see this book out there in the world, wants to raise awareness of the under-known films it discusses or supports independent authors and publishers.</p>
<p>Tell you friends about this book.  Help us generate the buzz.  Asymmetrical marketing means help comes from people like you who are excited to see writers and small presses succeed. </p>

We are looking to raise  $5000 in order to finance a marketing blitz over the next two months.
In the publishing industry, the profile of any book is often set within the first couple of weeks of it's initial release to the general public.  That profile is raised and expanded through marketing to industry insiders in order to get book buyers to notice a publication.
Small independent booksellers and large wholesalers have many titles competing for their attention and stocking.  For the bibliophile and the casual book consumer alike, there is great competition, both by established industry gatekeepers and through algorithms for attention.
We are asking you for a small leg up on this project.  Through our intensive study and publishing on the intelligence community we are no strangers to information warfare. As alternative media a commitment to waging that struggle asymmetrically was part of our inception.
On May 10th, the book will be released to the broadest possible audience.  We want to reach that date with a great deal of buzz generated. 
To this end we have books in stock, which are one of the perks you can receive with a donation. We also have T-shirts featuring art from the book and condoms with the same art on the wrapper as items that you can wear proudly to generate conversation about this book.
A $10 contribution will get you a condom mailed to you at the address you provide.
We have books in stock and we sell them for $24.95 on our website now. However a contribution of $30 will get you both a copy of the book and a condom (while supplies last on the latter) at the address you provide.
A $60 contribution will get you 1 book, 1 condom and 1 T-shirt (again while supplies last). Please specify men's or women's t-shirts and size.

How your help in turn helps us:
Mockingbird Publishing has taken unique looks at under-reported stories and under-discussed topics for 6 years now.
This little bit of help is a big boost to us.  It also allows us to give you a physical item (like the book) that you can show or wear (like the shirts or condom).
The are many films in many languages that are reviewed and discussed in this anthology. Armed with this new knowledge, you have new ways to explore your desires, and discuss them with a friend or friends.
This is a book of conversations. Our aim is to stimulate more stimulating conversation. 

This is a new challenge for us
Publishing is a small world dominated by giants.  With this book, Mockingbird now launched 5 titles in 6 years.  However we are still a David in a world of tall men in armor.
There is a chance that despite your help, this may not be the sling bullet that strikes home.  But that does not decrease our faith or determination.

Other ways you can help
Even if you were not sufficiently stimulated by the government recently or every condom you come into the possession of is not going to be the topic of a long conversation, there are ways you can help us:
Share this fundraiser.  Somebody you know wants to see this book out there in the world, wants to raise awareness of the under-known films it discusses or supports independent authors and publishers.
Tell you friends about this book.  Help us generate the buzz.  Asymmetrical marketing means help comes from people like you who are excited to see writers and small presses succeed.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Welcome to the Florida Writers Project</h3>
<p>For the past 10 years, Wordier Than Thou has connected Florida writers and readers in fun, offbeat ways, whether it's through immersive theater projects or drag and burlesque shows or themed storytelling events. </p>
<p>Now, we want to publish the work of Florida authors. We're raising funds for our first publishing project, Tennessee Murder Ballad, the debut novel of Heather Jones.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic pushed back our publication timeline for Tennessee Murder Ballad, but we're back on track and plan to release it this summer. Pre-order your copy today!</p>
<h3>About Tennessee Murder Ballad</h3>
<p>In April 1848, preacher Paul Crane rides into a lonesome Appalachian town and kills Ellen Bridges, a widow whose music he believes to be witchcraft, by throwing her into a well. A group of children, including her grandson, Carter, push him in after her to avenge her murder. As the preacher disappears into the darkness, he curses the children, the town, and the mountains where they live.</p>
<p>Eight of the children grow up to survive the American Civil War only to re-encounter the preacher’s curse. But the music and love of Ellen Bridges have also survived in the mountains. During four days in April 1866, as the moon waxes full, a sinister circus appears on Ellen’s former property, and a fire rages down the mountain, each of the remaining children, now adults, meets their destiny of redemption, or death.</p>
<h3>What Readers Are Saying</h3>
<p>“If Zora Neale Hurston, Stephen Crane, Toni Morrison, and Annie Proulx started an a cappella group specializing in haunting love songs in five-part harmony—the fifth part being the ghost note—and you were lucky enough to listen, you might be able to imagine some of the power of Heather Jones’s novel Tennessee Murder Ballad.”</p>
<p>           —Jill Kelly Koren, author of Though the Word is a Lie</p>
<p>“Layering folklore and magical realism against the bleak, poverty-stricken backdrop of rural Appalachia post-Civil War, Heather Jones writes with a talent and historical perspective that is astounding.”</p>
<p>                    —Kimberly Lojewski, author of Worm Fiddling Nocturne in the Key of a Broken Heart</p>
<p>“…a multi-voiced, Faulknerian investigation of one horrible day in Sinking Springs…Jones’ style is as direct and earthy as the ballads she references, making Tennessee Murder Ballad an easy read in one way, a spooky and challenging one in another. Magical, Freudian Southern Gothic at its finest!”</p>
<p>                                                       —David Brendan Hopes, author of The Falls of the Wyona</p>

<h3>Resumen</h3>
<p>Y si cambiamos la manera de leer un libro a un niño/a?? Esta historia fue escrita y diseñada para ayudar nuestros pequeños a perder pequeños miedos que les frena en sus grandes avances, en su desarrollo por el conocimiento del mundo, y fue creado en base a la historia real que vivimos con mi hijo menor, que permitió que personajes ficticios invadieran nuestra casa, por su gran imaginación y que con un simple juego, reforzamos su valentía, su seguridad, y... funcionó!!! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trabajé muchos años con niños de todas las edades, de diferentes ámbitos familiaries, educación, niños sobre-protegidos y niños que quizás merecían más atención como niños que son, muchas veces a falta de atención, cariño, desfavorecidos, que podía sentir más inseguros y que por tanto su comportamiento se veía reflejado..  Pero no podemos juzgar sus progenitores, ya que era una simple observación como madre que soy. </p>
<p>Pero es un factor importante que me empujó a crear un libro en el que mi objetivo es convertir un momento especial del cuento de la noche. Alargar una historia llena de sorpresas, dónde padres y niños necesitan unirse para afrontar juntos emociones, crear el suspense del descubrimiento, vivir una complicidad para afrontar, jugando y aprendiendo, a superar el miedo a lo desconocido, con la imaginación ser capaces de alcanzar cualquier reto!!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Conocí una diseñadora gráfica increíble que digitalizó todo mi trabajo, y un representante y asesor magnífico que está pendiente de recibir el proyecto para imprimirlo, todo está listo, las características bien estudiadas  del material final solo esperan  el pago del presupuesto..  y ahí está mi limitación económica..  el presupuesto que necesito alcanzar a través de todos ustedes es para que una vez alcanzado en tres semanas pueda entregarles y presentarles mi gran sueño que deseo compartir!!! </p>

<p>With them, she can save mankind…</p>
<p>Or use them to bring her beloved sons back from the dead.</p>
<p>But she cannot do both!</p>
<p>Will Marie return the Rings to their rightful place, saving millions…</p>
<p>Or will she bring her boys back, and see her unholy actions allow Satan to once again rule the earth!</p>
<p>I hope I’ve hooked you with that little passage.<span>  (smile)</span></p>

The JÉNE NÉTE (Water World) Poetry Book is the first in the series of four NON ÁXEBO (Our Customs) books based on the four cosmological worlds/dimensions of the Shipibo-Konibo, which will be released every year for the next four years. 
 
Supporting Art Installation - UPDATE: Jéne Néte Wins 1st Place and Public Choice Award at the CA 101 Exhibit 2018 - June 1-10 CA 101 Exhibit Redondo Beach, CA  


The art installation by Mike Saijo is a reflection of a sacred ceremonial space, based on his recent healing and leaning experience with the Great Grand Mother Jakón Raté, a 70-year-old Shipibo-Konibo healer, and the powerful medicines of Óni (portal to wisdom and the spirit realm) and Noyá Ráo (the mythological master teacher plant). 

Great Grand Mother Jakón Raté and her handmade Noyá Ráo textile art.
The art installation will include reproductions of original portraits of Shipibo-Konibo children and family portraits taken in their hometown. Handmade textile art, ceramic bowls and masks made by the indigenous crafts women will also be part of the installation.

All the items in the installation will be for sale to raise money to reach our goal. The crowdsource campaign will launch at the opening of the CA 101 exhibition taking place June 1-10, 2018 in Redondo Beach, CA. The installation will be scaled down and included in a group show at BG Gallery, opening Saturday, June 16, 2018.

 
I will need $5000 to publish 1000 books. 500 for US distribution and 500 for Peru, for schools and libraries.

<h3><strong>La parola agli autori</strong></h3>
<p><i>L'immagine di un centauro che attraversa la brousse con il suo bolide ornato di corna gigantesche, è stata illuminante. Quel centauro donna, simbolo di un'Africa che verrà mi ha fatto viaggiare nello spazio-tempo. Ho già visto in quella sequenza l'eroe Marvel a venire Black Panther, e scoperto che Godard era stato il Djibril Diop Mambéty francese e George Lucas il primo effettista speciale ""american-african”. </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>Roberto Silvestri</strong></p>
<p><i>A  20 dalla scomparsa di Djibril Diop Mambéty è fondamentale mantenere viva, e divulgare la sua esperienza poetica e politica che fra gli anni 60 e 90 ha riposizionato lo sguardo sul cinema africano e non solo. Un cineasta, un visionario, un attento osservatore delle mutazioni sociali e politiche del suo paese, il Senegal, della sua amata Dakar e non solo. Un autore che, con poche opere, continua a parlarci, a chiamarci in causa, a chiederci di compiere gesti sovversivi nel nostro presente, senza i quali non avremo il futuro. Un autore, come pochi altri nella seconda parte del Novecento, i cui film testimoniano, ancora e sempre, la necessità di costruire “un cinema che verrà”.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>Giuseppe Gariazzo</strong></p>
<p><i>I am excited to contribute to this edited collection on Djibril Diop Mambéty with essays that examine Mambéty’s vast contributions to Senegalese and global cinema.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>Mahriana Rofheart</strong></p>
<p><br/><i>At a time when African filmmakers were negotiating a common aesthetic stance, Djibril Diop Mambéty established himself as one the most innovative and daring filmmakers among them. His cinematography is rich, his vision unique and his narratives engaging.  Djibril Diop Mambéty was, by any stretch of the imagination, an accomplished and versatile artist. The films he left us exude a unique composition, enthralling sounds and vivid colors. Their artfulness usher in the novel cinematic styles of Abderrahmane Sissako, the late Fanta Mady Camara, Alain Gomis and many others. The present tribute to his many contributions to African cinema is both fitting and timely.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>Sada Niang</strong></p>
<p><br/><i>Alongside the venerable Ousmane Sembene, Djibril Diop Mambéty is the most important directorial voice to come out of Africa. A cinéaste of sound and a gifted storyteller, Mambety was one of the most innovative filmmakers, not just in the African context but in international cinema as well. This volume will continue to shed light on his spectacular contribution to world cinema.</i></p>

<p><i>Vingt ans, vingt ans déjà ! Vingt ans seulement, que l'""Homme aux semelles de vent"" nous a quittés. Il est mort à Paris, le 23 juillet 1998, pendant la première édition du festival Racines, Rencontres des cinémas du Monde Noir, que je venais de créer à l’époque; des rencontres dont il avait encouragé la naissance, qu’il avait portées et qu'il avait prises, comme moi, sous son aile protectrice; lui, mon ami si cher, l'homme fragile et pourtant indomptable. Plus riche que les ""riches"", il avait la force et le courage de ceux qui ne renoncent jamais. Djibril Diop Mambéty nous a laissé pour tout bagage un héritage: l'exigence. Exigence, devoir de mémoire, mémoire vive, mémoire critique, indépendance, responsabilité… Djibril Diop Mambéty sera à jamais notre guide, passeur de souvenirs, de valeurs et de rêves, celui qui nous entraine à grandes brassées d'images, sur cette terre d'Afrique qu'il a tant aimée et peinte, avec des personnages vieux comme le monde et jeunes comme le rêve d'un nouveau siècle; un passeur d'espoir, un passeur de lumière. Mon ami Djibril!""</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>Catherine Ruelle</strong></p>
<p><i>On m'a souvent demandé pourquoi j'avais pendant des années travaillé avec Djibril Diop Mambety. Faire un film avec Djibril était autre chose que de chercher des financements et de «faire le film». Djibril nous mettait au défi; il y avait une dimension de l'imprévu, de la surprise et de la découverte, qui nous ramenait toujours à l'essentiel de l'humain autour d'une idée, autour d'images et de son. Je pense que ça s'appelle la créativité!</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>Silvia Voser</strong></p>
<p><i>L'apport de Djibril Diop Mambéty au cinéma, déborde les problématiques de l'audiovisuel africain pour élargir la perception et la conscience des spectateurs. C'est pourquoi il est indispensable d'éclairer son travail et sa personnalité dans une publication collective aujourd'hui. Pour l'avoir bien connu, le faire reconnaître est une transmission impérieuse.  </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>Michel Amarger</strong></p>
<p><i>Djibril était le plus grand des cinéastes africains. Il est essentiel pour les générations présentes et futures de contribuer à sa mémoire et à l'étude de ses oeuvres. </i></p>

 Mambéty o il viaggio della ienaSostieni la pubblicazione della prima opera in Italia interamente dedicata al maestro visionario del cinema africano. Un autore che, con poche opere, continua a parlarci, a chiamarci in causa, a chiederci di compiere gesti sovversivi nel nostro presente, senza i quali non avremo il futuro.​
Questa è la storia di un incontro 
Il nostro incontro con Mambéty nasce alle Colonne di San Lorenzo, cinema di Milano che fu, dove noi, giovani studentesse di cinema, restammo folgorate dalla visione di Hyènes  e Touki Bouki, in occasione del Festival del Cinema Africano di Milano.
Per anni ci siamo dette che dovevamo pensare a un libro su di lui visto che in Italia mancava e, finalmente, quest'anno, nell'anniversario della sua scomparsa siamo passate dalle parole ai fatti insieme al COE. 
Grazie a voi potremo realizzare il primo libro su Djibril Diop Mambéty, un'opera che, a 20 anni dalla sua prematura scomparsa, rende omaggio al maestro che ha rivoluzionato il cinema.
L'uscita del libro è prevista in due edizioni: italiana e francese con i contributi di Michel Amarger, Olivier Barlet, Simona Cella, Cecilia Cenciarelli, Thierno Ibrahima Dia, Vlad Dima, Giuseppe Gariazzo, Sada Niang, Cinzia Quadrati, Mahriana Rofheart, Catherine Ruelle, Roberto Silvestri, Alessandra Speciale e Silvia Voser.
Per realizzare l'edizione italiana dobbiamo garantire all'editore l'acquisto di 100 copie.
Queste prime copie le vogliamo dedicare a voi che, sostenendoci, diventerete parte fondamentale di questo progetto editoriale inedito in Italia. Un libro dedicato ad un grande regista, un uomo di cultura che ha rivoluzionato il cinema africano e ha fatto conoscere la cultura del suo paese nel mondo.
Le donazioni serviranno a rendere possibile la pubblicazione, pagare le traduzioni in italiano e francese e i contributi degli autori e il coordinamento di redazione. 
Il vostro contributo renderà possibile tutto questo, quindi GRAZIE!

Qu'est-ce qui signifie faire du cinéma?
C'est ce qui est la rencontre,c'est ce qui est l'ordre du possible.Il n'y a que des possibles qui se rencontrent.Pas des amis forcément, mais des possibles.Donc je suis en attente et je suis à la recherche de possibles.Et quand je rencontre des possibles, nous faisons ensemble des petites merveilles.
Djibril Diop Mambéty
Djibril Diop Mambéty: il Godard africano
Raffinato, visionario, innovatore. Djibril Diop Mambéty (1945-1998), nella sua folgorante ma breve carriera, ha rivoluzionato la storia del cinema africano e non solo, inventando nuovi modelli narrativi e alternativi alla scuola realista di Sembène Ousmane. Con la sua continua sperimentazione di stili, ha scardinato la tradizionale dialettica tradizione vs. modernità e cultura africana vs. cultura occidentale. I suoi film più celebri Touki Bouki e Hyènes, sono veri e propri manifesti cinematografici e politici.
Touki Bouki e il miraggio europeo
Touki Bouki  è un atto di ribellione contro il miraggio dell'Europa, un racconto di grande lucidità sul volto della migrazione clandestina: esperienza vissuta in prima persona da Mambéty, imbarcatosi clandestinamente su una nave diretta a Marsiglia ed immediatamente espulso.

""Touki Bouki, con la sua inedita selvaggia energia, esplode un'immagine alla volta"", è così che il maestro Martin Scorsese descrive il film, inserendo Djibril tra le figure più ispiratrici del mondo del cinema. Fu The Film Foundation - World Cinema Project di Scorsese nel 2008 ad occuparsi del restauro di Touki Bouki, con la Cineteca di Bologna / L'Immagine Ritrovata Laboratory.

Touki Bouki è anche citato nella campagna promozionale dell'ultimo tour di Beyoncé.


Il j'accuse di Hyènes

Hyènes, geniale rivisitazione della pièce di Frederich Dürrenmatt La visita della Vecchia Signora, racconta il ritorno al villaggio natale di una donna arricchita all'estero e lancia un tagliente j'accuse  contro i grandi organismi internazionali e il potere corruttore del denaro.
La trilogia incompiuta Histoire de Petit Gens, trattato alla gente comune di Dakar, con stile zavattiniano, attua la teoria del pedinamento, dando vita a delle suggestive favole urbane, tra cronaca e poesia.
Mambéty e l'Italia
Vissuto tra Dakar, Parigi e la Svizzera, Mambéty aveva un legame con l'Italia e ha partecipato varie volte al Festival del Cinema Africano di Milano. 
Giovane attore nei film di Piero Vivarelli, nel 1972 incontra a Roma Pier Paolo Pasolini, uno dei suoi maestri ispiratori.  
Durante il montaggio di Touki Bouki negli studi romani, Mambéty viene arrestato per aver partecipato a una manifestazione antirazzista e liberato grazie all'intervento di intellettuali, registi e attori, tra i quali spiccano Bernardo Bertolucci e Sophia Loren.
Il suo cinema urbano e postmoderno continua a inspirare i registi del continente. Tracce, citazioni ed omaggi si trovano nei film di Moussa Sene Absa, Alain Gomis, Mati Diop, Abderramane Sissako e molti altri.
 


La parola agli autori
L'immagine di un centauro che attraversa la brousse con il suo bolide ornato di corna gigantesche, è stata illuminante. Quel centauro donna, simbolo di un'Africa che verrà mi ha fatto viaggiare nello spazio-tempo. Ho già visto in quella sequenza l'eroe Marvel a venire Black Panther, e scoperto che Godard era stato il Djibril Diop Mambéty francese e George Lucas il primo effettista speciale ""american-african”. 
Roberto Silvestri
A  20 dalla scomparsa di Djibril Diop Mambéty è fondamentale mantenere viva, e divulgare la sua esperienza poetica e politica che fra gli anni 60 e 90 ha riposizionato lo sguardo sul cinema africano e non solo. Un cineasta, un visionario, un attento osservatore delle mutazioni sociali e politiche del suo paese, il Senegal, della sua amata Dakar e non solo. Un autore che, con poche opere, continua a parlarci, a chiamarci in causa, a chiederci di compiere gesti sovversivi nel nostro presente, senza i quali non avremo il futuro. Un autore, come pochi altri nella seconda parte del Novecento, i cui film testimoniano, ancora e sempre, la necessità di costruire “un cinema che verrà”.
Giuseppe Gariazzo
I am excited to contribute to this edited collection on Djibril Diop Mambéty with essays that examine Mambéty’s vast contributions to Senegalese and global cinema.
Mahriana Rofheart
At a time when African filmmakers were negotiating a common aesthetic stance, Djibril Diop Mambéty established himself as one the most innovative and daring filmmakers among them. His cinematography is rich, his vision unique and his narratives engaging.  Djibril Diop Mambéty was, by any stretch of the imagination, an accomplished and versatile artist. The films he left us exude a unique composition, enthralling sounds and vivid colors. Their artfulness usher in the novel cinematic styles of Abderrahmane Sissako, the late Fanta Mady Camara, Alain Gomis and many others. The present tribute to his many contributions to African cinema is both fitting and timely.
Sada Niang
Alongside the venerable Ousmane Sembene, Djibril Diop Mambéty is the most important directorial voice to come out of Africa. A cinéaste of sound and a gifted storyteller, Mambety was one of the most innovative filmmakers, not just in the African context but in international cinema as well. This volume will continue to shed light on his spectacular contribution to world cinema.
Vlad Dima
Vingt ans, vingt ans déjà ! Vingt ans seulement, que l'""Homme aux semelles de vent"" nous a quittés. Il est mort à Paris, le 23 juillet 1998, pendant la première édition du festival Racines, Rencontres des cinémas du Monde Noir, que je venais de créer à l’époque; des rencontres dont il avait encouragé la naissance, qu’il avait portées et qu'il avait prises, comme moi, sous son aile protectrice; lui, mon ami si cher, l'homme fragile et pourtant indomptable. Plus riche que les ""riches"", il avait la force et le courage de ceux qui ne renoncent jamais. Djibril Diop Mambéty nous a laissé pour tout bagage un héritage: l'exigence. Exigence, devoir de mémoire, mémoire vive, mémoire critique, indépendance, responsabilité… Djibril Diop Mambéty sera à jamais notre guide, passeur de souvenirs, de valeurs et de rêves, celui qui nous entraine à grandes brassées d'images, sur cette terre d'Afrique qu'il a tant aimée et peinte, avec des personnages vieux comme le monde et jeunes comme le rêve d'un nouveau siècle; un passeur d'espoir, un passeur de lumière. Mon ami Djibril!""
Catherine Ruelle
On m'a souvent demandé pourquoi j'avais pendant des années travaillé avec Djibril Diop Mambety. Faire un film avec Djibril était autre chose que de chercher des financements et de «faire le film». Djibril nous mettait au défi; il y avait une dimension de l'imprévu, de la surprise et de la découverte, qui nous ramenait toujours à l'essentiel de l'humain autour d'une idée, autour d'images et de son. Je pense que ça s'appelle la créativité!
Silvia Voser
L'apport de Djibril Diop Mambéty au cinéma, déborde les problématiques de l'audiovisuel africain pour élargir la perception et la conscience des spectateurs. C'est pourquoi il est indispensable d'éclairer son travail et sa personnalité dans une publication collective aujourd'hui. Pour l'avoir bien connu, le faire reconnaître est une transmission impérieuse.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! Thank you for stopping in on my campaign. I have always wanted to write a book, as long as I can remember. Now I need your help to get it going. It is amazing how much it costs to get a book launched from editing to design work it is unceasing. Thank you for taking the time to read my profile and check out the project. Every bit of support helps!</p>
<p> If you do not already know me, I am Sharissa Bradley. I am an experimental psychologist turned nutritionist. I have spent the last 10 years studying psychology, the human brain, health, nutrition, myths around food as well as the idea that we know what to do and yet we still, seemingly, <i>chose</i> not to do it.</p>
<p>After personally being diagnosed with 4-autoimmune diseases. I leaned very heavily on my research background and tried to learn as much as I could about the origin of autoimmunity as well as learning as much as I could about healing without industry standard medications. After 6-months of research and using myself as a guinea pig, I was able to reverse my antibody response until it was untraceable. When I finally felt well enough to share my story with the world, I began coaching people to their own success stories. Now I want to share my findings with the world. It is time everyone knows how to gain total body wellness all the way from our psychology and genetic make-up to my personal tips for how to live the healthiest life you can. The book also includes several expert interviews and success stories. Perhaps most importantly, however, the book follows an actionable path with a custom workbook to follow and create your own plan. </p>
<p>Now, here is where you come in. Writing is a book is way more expensive than I thought. I figured I would put in a weekend here or there and type this up in my word processor and it would be good enough. Little did I know what the process actually costs. Getting this book out for the world to see is beyond important to me. This book came to me and it is my job to put it together cohesively so I can share it with you. Like Michelangelo says: “The sculpture is already complete within the marble block, before I start my work. It is already there, I just have to chisel away the superfluous material.”</p>
<p>Your contribution helps to pay for all the steps it takes to get this book in print! I hope you will help me on my journey to chisel away to create something beautiful for you. </p>

<p>In this campaign I am asking for the amount it will cost to get this book through publishing, editing and printing. Each of these components is a separate cost. I have chosen my team and the bids have rolled in. Now I need your help to get this thing made!</p>

<h2>Elson Auquel’s Journey to Breaking Inertia</h2>
<p>In the year 2010, an earthquake hit Haiti and all our lives changed forever. My name is Elson Auquel and here’s my story. </p>
<p>I graduated high school in 2013 but couldn't start college at the time due to unfavorable financial situations. I wanted to study Economic Science, but school was quite expensive in Haiti. I refused to be idle, so I started to volunteer. While volunteering, I dreamed. I dreamed of a life where every child from Haiti could be whoever they want to be.</p>
<p>First, I volunteered with Hands of Light and Action to help people from remote villages who had suffered from the 2010 Earthquakes. This saw me traveling distances of up to 40 minutes to an hour regularly to reach some of the earthquake-affected areas. I also volunteered with a few other organizations including the Caribbean Youth Environment Network in 2014, Florida A&amp;M University Farmer to Farmer USAID Program (2015) and WhyFarm (We Help Youth Farm)  in 2016. </p>
<p>I volunteer presently in a mission where I am helping teenagers find their purpose and passion in order to create a bright future for themselves and to make the world a better place to live. Volunteering has always been a huge part of my story. I believe that we all have a responsibility to bring compassion to a broken world.</p>
<p>I have had my fair share of failures and this has helped me to develop a more balanced view of work and enterprise growth. I failed at scaling 4 start-ups for which I was passionate but probably less informed and now better positioned to pursue. I have had the time to think deeply about what strengths I got from these experiences.</p>
<p>My failures led to a period of strong introspection and self-discovery. I discovered and started to build more on new skills and strengths that I discovered. I've had a reasonably demonstrated history of success in the marketing and advertising industry. Working in this industry exposed me to learning opportunities that helped me hone my skills in Customer Service, Public Speaking, Social Media Advertising, and Graphic Design. I also became a stronger business development professional through an associate degree in Agricultural Engineering, at the Universite Caraibe.</p>
<p>I am a storyteller, outbox thinker, and a change maker who believes anyone can accomplish whatever they want if they are willing to learn. With all this in mind, I have embarked on this book journey to ""Breaking Inertia"".</p>
<h2>About Breaking Inertia</h2>
<p><i><strong>Breaking Inertia: Helping  Millennial keep their head Over and above the floods</strong></i></p>
<p>""Breaking Inertia"" is an open call to help save a generation that's in a hurry to succeed. How can anyone find success and happiness in a fast-paced digital generation that is stuck on instant gratification? This is a question that Breaking Inertia addresses through experiential, practical and story-driven narrative. My book seeks to enlighten, inspire and guide. You'd love reading the book and at the same time take away a lot of life-lessons that can be instantly applied to your life. My book focuses on the themes of success and happiness for the millennial youth. My book will publish in June 2020. </p>
<p>I have divided Breaking Inertia into 3 parts: </p>
<p>The first 8 Chapters - Helps to define the millennial's lifestyle and evolution into unhappiness. It answers the question, what has created this unhappy person? This dissatisfaction and discontent must be understood from the viewpoint of the millennial youth. </p>
<p>The second 8 Chapters - Focused on industry &amp; work culture. We need to understand the interaction between work and the person. What contribution does the workplace make into the lifestyle of the millennial and what can be fixed about this? Is there something about job expectation and career choices that makes life unbearable?</p>
<p>Third 8 Chapters - Discusses the power of relationships and personality in shaping the millennial's reality. What would it take to build better, happier relationships and persons? </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Introduction: Book Story</h2>
<p>Breaking Inertia:<i> Get Smarter Than The Trends </i></p>
<p>BREAKING INERTIA answers the question of how we can achieve success and happiness in a fast-paced digital generation that is stuck on instant gratification. </p>
<p>I grew up in Haiti where life was far from easy. This once beautiful Island was suddenly thrown into chaos and a lot of us had to live through challenges that so many millennials would be horrified to imagine. Growing up without my parents, I realized that life was not going to hand me any opportunities. However, I realized that I could take one step after another towards my dream life. Writing this book titled ""Breaking Inertia"" would be a great opportunity for me to provide answers to other millennial through my own experiences and those of key figures that have addressed the millennial questions of happiness and success. </p>
<p>Every young person around now is desperately asking questions that a lot of us find difficult to answer. Why am I not happy? Why is life so hard? Why can't I get what I want? Why am I stuck? </p>
<p>That young person is stuck on his phone waiting for notifications so they can be happy about their life and relationships that they don't have. They are waiting on the stock market, the e-commerce sales and other volatile industries in order to be successful. The millennial is told that unless he can make a million dollars instantly, then he is not yet successful. </p>
<p>This has created a work culture that relies a lot on instant results in order to evaluate performance. Instant gratification makes sure that addictions are easily formed. With these addictions come a constant urge to win, or to get results that have not been invested in for a long time. You can see how this leads to more and more depressed and unhappy young people. </p>
<p>Getting the millennial BREAKING INERTIA is a powerful vision that would transform a whole generation into stronger, healthier, happier people. </p>
<p>BREAKING INERTIA is about discovering how millennials can be helped to achieve success and happiness in a fast-paced digital generation that is stuck on instant gratification. By buying into this project, you are giving thousands of young people an opportunity to live happier lives that will counteract addictions, depression, mental health struggles, trauma, and anxiety</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">3. This approach gives me the freedom to market and promotes my book the way I want to.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">4. I find the fulfillment in knowing that there's a ready audience to read my book before<br/>publishing.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">5. It's a perfect opportunity to share my journey as an author with a community that shares<br/>similar values and visions as I do.</p>

<h3><strong>About the Author</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Elson Auquel. I was born in a small country side in Haiti and grew up in Port Au Prince.  I was born in Haiti but relocated to the U.S.A after much deliberations. I currently live in Orlando FL where I work as a customer service advocate and entrepreneur. I have had enough formal education to leverage on for success in the various spaces I have worked. </p>

In the year 2010, an earthquake hit Haiti and all our lives changed forever. My name is Elson Auquel and here’s my story. 
I graduated high school in 2013 but couldn't start college at the time due to unfavorable financial situations. I wanted to study Economic Science, but school was quite expensive in Haiti. I refused to be idle, so I started to volunteer. While volunteering, I dreamed. I dreamed of a life where every child from Haiti could be whoever they want to be.
First, I volunteered with Hands of Light and Action to help people from remote villages who had suffered from the 2010 Earthquakes. This saw me traveling distances of up to 40 minutes to an hour regularly to reach some of the earthquake-affected areas. I also volunteered with a few other organizations including the Caribbean Youth Environment Network in 2014, Florida A&M University Farmer to Farmer USAID Program (2015) and WhyFarm (We Help Youth Farm)  in 2016. 
I volunteer presently in a mission where I am helping teenagers find their purpose and passion in order to create a bright future for themselves and to make the world a better place to live. Volunteering has always been a huge part of my story. I believe that we all have a responsibility to bring compassion to a broken world.
I have had my fair share of failures and this has helped me to develop a more balanced view of work and enterprise growth. I failed at scaling 4 start-ups for which I was passionate but probably less informed and now better positioned to pursue. I have had the time to think deeply about what strengths I got from these experiences.
My failures led to a period of strong introspection and self-discovery. I discovered and started to build more on new skills and strengths that I discovered. I've had a reasonably demonstrated history of success in the marketing and advertising industry. Working in this industry exposed me to learning opportunities that helped me hone my skills in Customer Service, Public Speaking, Social Media Advertising, and Graphic Design. I also became a stronger business development professional through an associate degree in Agricultural Engineering, at the Universite Caraibe.
I am a storyteller, outbox thinker, and a change maker who believes anyone can accomplish whatever they want if they are willing to learn. With all this in mind, I have embarked on this book journey to ""Breaking Inertia"".
About Breaking Inertia
Breaking Inertia: Helping  Millennial keep their head Over and above the floods
""Breaking Inertia"" is an open call to help save a generation that's in a hurry to succeed. How can anyone find success and happiness in a fast-paced digital generation that is stuck on instant gratification? This is a question that Breaking Inertia addresses through experiential, practical and story-driven narrative. My book seeks to enlighten, inspire and guide. You'd love reading the book and at the same time take away a lot of life-lessons that can be instantly applied to your life. My book focuses on the themes of success and happiness for the millennial youth. My book will publish in June 2020. 
I have divided Breaking Inertia into 3 parts: 
The first 8 Chapters - Helps to define the millennial's lifestyle and evolution into unhappiness. It answers the question, what has created this unhappy person? This dissatisfaction and discontent must be understood from the viewpoint of the millennial youth. 
The second 8 Chapters - Focused on industry & work culture. We need to understand the interaction between work and the person. What contribution does the workplace make into the lifestyle of the millennial and what can be fixed about this? Is there something about job expectation and career choices that makes life unbearable?
Third 8 Chapters - Discusses the power of relationships and personality in shaping the millennial's reality. What would it take to build better, happier relationships and persons? 

Introduction: Book Story
Breaking Inertia: Get Smarter Than The Trends 
BREAKING INERTIA answers the question of how we can achieve success and happiness in a fast-paced digital generation that is stuck on instant gratification. 
I grew up in Haiti where life was far from easy. This once beautiful Island was suddenly thrown into chaos and a lot of us had to live through challenges that so many millennials would be horrified to imagine. Growing up without my parents, I realized that life was not going to hand me any opportunities. However, I realized that I could take one step after another towards my dream life. Writing this book titled ""Breaking Inertia"" would be a great opportunity for me to provide answers to other millennial through my own experiences and those of key figures that have addressed the millennial questions of happiness and success. 
Every young person around now is desperately asking questions that a lot of us find difficult to answer. Why am I not happy? Why is life so hard? Why can't I get what I want? Why am I stuck? 
That young person is stuck on his phone waiting for notifications so they can be happy about their life and relationships that they don't have. They are waiting on the stock market, the e-commerce sales and other volatile industries in order to be successful. The millennial is told that unless he can make a million dollars instantly, then he is not yet successful. 
This has created a work culture that relies a lot on instant results in order to evaluate performance. Instant gratification makes sure that addictions are easily formed. With these addictions come a constant urge to win, or to get results that have not been invested in for a long time. You can see how this leads to more and more depressed and unhappy young people. 
Getting the millennial BREAKING INERTIA is a powerful vision that would transform a whole generation into stronger, healthier, happier people. 
BREAKING INERTIA is about discovering how millennials can be helped to achieve success and happiness in a fast-paced digital generation that is stuck on instant gratification. By buying into this project, you are giving thousands of young people an opportunity to live happier lives that will counteract addictions, depression, mental health struggles, trauma, and anxiety

About the Author
My name is Elson Auquel. I was born in a small country side in Haiti and grew up in Port Au Prince.  I was born in Haiti but relocated to the U.S.A after much deliberations. I currently live in Orlando FL where I work as a customer service advocate and entrepreneur. I have had enough formal education to leverage on for success in the various spaces I have worked. 
I have seen first-hand that life demands much more than ease and comfort. I'd like to help my readers navigate some of their tough life experiences to the point of success. Thanks for taking time to read about my book project.  It was one of the tough decisions I had to make because it came with a lot of uncertainties. Having grown up without my parents, I had learned to make a lot of tough calls quite early in life. I believed God had and still has a purpose for me which he is achieving through my move to the U.S.A. Breaking Inertia is one out of those plans that I believe he has begun to unfold. 
As soon as I could apply myself to work, I had started to serve in various ways. I worked in the past with Wade Darius Former Democrat Congress Candidate for Orange County District 10. I managed their digital campaign and online presence. I also intern at the WATERING MINDS INC where I have provided the team with strategic consulting and serve in the fundraising.

<h2><strong>Optimiser l'apprentissage de la guitare populaire (Blues, Jazz, Rock, etc.)</strong></h2>
<p>Vous souhaitez amener votre jeu de guitare au prochain niveau ? Vous êtes à la recherche de nouvelles manières d'approcher vos séances de travail instrumental ? Vous souhaitez stimuler votre motivation à prendre l'instrument ? </p>
<p>Ce livre vous plaira à coup sûr !</p>
<p>Le parcours et les apprentissages de chaque musicien imposent une grande détermination, des cibles claires et une rigueur accrue afin de toujours progresser. Pour ce faire, tout musicien doit continuellement se questionner sur la façon dont il investit ses heures de travail instrumental. Sans une telle approche, il risque d’assimiler par inadvertance de mauvaises habitudes qui lui seront difficiles à corriger et qui pourront même le démotiver. Ainsi, pour donner suite à la lecture d’ouvrages scientifiques et non scientifiques au sujet de la performance ainsi qu’à la lumière de nombreux témoignages d’experts et musiciens professionnels au sujet de l’apprentissage, j’ai décidé d’écrire une méthode exposant différents concepts qui permettent d’optimiser les séances de travail instrumental. Je présente en complément plusieurs exercices pour l’apprentissage de la guitare.</p>
<h3><strong>À qui s’adresse cette méthode ?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li> À ceux qui ont l’impression de mettre beaucoup d’heures à répéter, mais qui ne sentent pas que leurs progrès sont équivalents à leurs efforts ;</li>
<li>Aux amateurs de guitare qui souhaitent approfondir leur connaissance et qui souhaitent restructurer leur travail instrumental afin de le rendre plus efficace tout en ayant des concepts à travailler ;</li>
<li>À ceux qui visent le niveau collégial et universitaire et qui souhaite s’y préparer ;</li>
<li>Aux musiciens plus expérimentés qui souhaitent réfléchir à leur manière d’aborder le travail instrumental afin de voir s’il serait possible de l’optimiser davantage ;</li>
<li>Aux enseignants qui cherchent de nouvelles manières d’aider leurs élèves à cheminer ;</li>
<li>À tous les curieux et passionnés de guitare qui désirent optimiser leur travail instrumental.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sur le marché, on retrouve une grande quantité de méthodes de guitare présentant une panoplie d’exercices à travailler. Toutefois, rares sont les ouvrages dans lesquels on explique comment aborder et intégrer efficacement ces exercices à une routine de travail instrumental. Cette méthode propose non seulement plusieurs exercices, mais a aussi pour but d’éclairer les musiciens sur leur démarche d’apprentissage. Ainsi, il ne s’agit pas d’une méthode progressive où il faut maitriser un exercice avant de passer au suivant. Je vous propose donc d’en faire une lecture complète en identifiant les éléments qui se prêtent le mieux à votre contexte actuel. Au besoin, vous pourrez y revenir ultérieurement et saisir d’autres éléments tout au long de votre cheminement.</p>
<p>Bonne lecture !</p>
<h3><strong>Le grand défi :</strong></h3>
<p>Suite à plusieurs heures de réflexion, de recherches, d'écriture et de mise en page, je suis maintenant convaincu que le contenu de ce livre pourra aider plus d'un musicien à optimiser son travail instrumental. L'un des grands défis pour moi est par rapport à la mise en marché. Sans un contrat d'édition, il est très dispendieux de rendre le livre accessible partout sur internet. Avec les fonds de cette campagne, je pourrai non seulement produire le livre en copie physique, mais aussi le rendre accessible à travers le monde sur les points de vente populaires tels qu'Amazon.</p>
<p>Merci à tous de m'encourager dans ce projet et j'espère sincèrement que ce livre vous donnera tous les outils et la motivation pour apprendre de façon optimale.</p>

<p><strong>An Oak of Righteousness: Grafting the Seeds of Destiny into the Root of Covenant</strong> is the natural progression of the Scripture from Isaiah 61 that Jesus read with authority in the synagogue after coming out of the wilderness empowered by Holy Spirit (Luke 4). The apostles and disciples of that day changed the course of nations as they were sent out to Judea, Samaria and the ends of the earth after the Holy Spirit also fell upon them. In 1988, at the end of a series of unfruitful evangelism outreaches in the neighborhoods she served, Yvonne cried out to the Lord in heart-wrenching desperation to see this level of transformational power released once again. This book, this “scroll”, is His answer to her prayers. It draws a clear picture of the Lord’s battle strategy for citywide and regional transformation applicable to every nation. His strategy includes the use of our ancient weapons of warfare: worship, prayer, spiritual gifts, especially prophecy, and angelic help. At its foundation is the truth that the Lord cares deeply about us both individually and corporately. And He made a promise to us through Covenant, so He has a plan!</p>
<p>Just as with John the Revelator in Revelation 10, there was a season that the message of this “scroll” was to be hidden; but now it is the message that the Lord gave Yvonne to “prophesy!” This “scroll” contains threads that are reminiscent of the Book of Acts, and the times of Abraham, Joseph, Moses, Esther, Nehemiah and other heroes of the faith. It interweaves a journey through time with profound supernatural encounters with key historical events and people. And it contains the elements - the fire, the wind, the rain - seen in every Great Awakening, as it ends with an open vision she had of angels sounding trumpets to awaken first His “generals and military leaders.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Come, and take a walk with Yvonne through her “scroll” of living testimonies. Whether you have already been serving the Lord, or this is His 11th hour call to you to labor with Him in His harvest fields, the trumpets are sounding! This is His clarion call for you to awaken, arise, repair, rebuild, reform and transform neighborhoods, cities and nations—it’s time!</p>

<h3>Resumen del proyecto</h3>
<p>Soy Mariana Babarovic, chilena, diseñadora gráfica editorial, actualmente me dedico al arte y la botánica. Este proyecto es producto de al rededor de tres años de trabajo, registro fotográfico, investigación, recolección de información y edición. Esta publicación cuenta con el apoyo de Ladera Sur (plataforma dedicada a la naturaleza con la cual colaboro) y el Museo Nacional de Historia Natural quienes me facilitaron el acceso a su herbario y me permitieron incluir algunas imágenes en este libro. Ellos son mis patrocinadores. La edición del libro estará a cargo de Marcela Kahler y la Editorial Velero.</p>
<p>Toda la información que hay en este libro, tomó forma después de un par de años de una voracidad botánica que me mantuvo alejada de mi trabajo de diseñadora y me capturó con una urgencia vital. Fue un cambio de cabeza que me obligó a tomar conciencia y entonces decidí darle forma a esta publicación para materializar mis propios intentos por ""entender"" la naturaleza. Para mí tiene mucho sentido que todo este período de reflexión e investigación termine en un libro, porque es lo que siempre he hecho como diseñadora gráfica y considero que son objetos fundamentales en la cultura y la construcción de imaginarios.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>La importancia de esta publicación</h3>
<p>Creo que el contenido de este libro y su estructura narrativa lo hacen especial. Concebirlo como una obra visual ha sido importante, me ha dado soltura de pensamiento y he podido narrar esta historia acudiendo a todos los lenguajes que me han parecido necesarios. Genero contenido, edito y diseño al mismo tiempo; esta coincidencia ha posibilitado una libertad narrativa que sería imposible de otra manera y que estoy segura ayudará a hacer de este libro un objeto distinto.</p>
<p>Los textos que encargué y los autores que contacté reflejan mis búsquedas. Ellos son personas con que me he encontrado a raíz de lecturas, estudios o sensibilidades en común, todos relacionados con la naturaleza de una u otra manera: Alejandra Vega, doctora en Historia, escribió sobre el <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wp2GDj_Cum8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Códice Badiano</a>; Kester Bull, botánico, está escribiendo sobre el trabajo taxonómico y la evolución de las especies; Catalina Valdés, doctora en Ciencias Sociales, escribe sobre las biogeografías y Jorge Mpodozis, Neurobiólogo de la Universidad de Chile, sobre naturalismo y percepción. <br/>También habrá un texto mío que sirve de introducción. </p>
<p>Estoy trabajando para que este objeto sea una bitácora de viajes mentales y físicos, un ayuda memoria que vincula mi propia biogeografía con los imaginarios colectivos de nuestra historia.</p>
<p>Este libro se imprimirá en imprenta Ograma, con ellos he trabajado toda la vida como diseñadora, son personas con las que tengo una larga relación de confianza y se especializan en proyectos de alta calidad. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Te ofrecemos recompensas para agradecer tu ayuda</h3>
<p>Los fondos solicitados serán destinados a la impresión del libro, los honorarios de los escritores y la editora y al pago de derecho de uso de imágenes. La suma total es de US$15.000.- (diez millones de pesos).</p>
<p>Mi manera de agradecer a los colaboradores será incorporando todos sus nombre en la página de agradecimientos para que siempre estén presentes junto a mi trabajo! Quienes aporten US$15 serán mencionados al interior del libro. Para quienes aporten 40 dólares, además, les enviaré una postal con un agradecimiento personal. Quienes aporten 100 dólares, recibirán una serigrafía a dos colores, de 21 x 28 cm., numerada y firmada. Finalmente, los que colaboren con US$260 podrán recibir un ejemplar del libro firmado.<br/>Si sucediera que no logre juntar todos los fondos, postularé al financiamiento del Fondo del Libro (financiamiento estatal) para obtener el saldo que me falte. <br/>Los primeros fondos que reciba se destinarán a pagarle a los escritores, la editora y a los derechos de uso de imágenes. Es básico partir cumpliendo el compromiso con las personas.</p>
</div><div><p> </p></div><div>
<h3>Riesgos y desafíos</h3>
<p>Hay que reconocer que el monto de este proyecto implica un gran desafío, es por eso que  paralelamente estamos buscando auspicios para, por ejemplo, conseguir el papel. Hay muchos medios para juntar fondos y estamos apelando a todos ellos.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Otras maneras de ayudar</h3>
<p>Si no estás en un buen momento y no puedes hacer una contribución económica, puedes ayudarnos con difusión, compartiendo esta campaña por redes sociales, contándole a la mayor cantidad de gente posible, mandando mails a tus conocidos, etc. Indiegogo tiene varias herramientas para compartir información!</p>

Esta publicación cuenta con el apoyo de Ladera Sur (plataforma dedicada a la naturaleza con la cual colaboro) y el Museo Nacional de Historia Natural quienes me facilitaron el acceso a su herbario y me permitieron incluir algunas imágenes en este libro. Ellos son mis patrocinadores. La edición del libro estará a cargo de Marcela Kahler y la Editorial Velero.
Toda la información que hay en este libro, tomó forma después de un par de años de una voracidad botánica que me mantuvo alejada de mi trabajo de diseñadora y me capturó con una urgencia vital. Fue un cambio de cabeza que me obligó a tomar conciencia y entonces decidí darle forma a esta publicación para materializar mis propios intentos por ""entender"" la naturaleza. Para mí tiene mucho sentido que todo este período de reflexión e investigación termine en un libro, porque es lo que siempre he hecho como diseñadora gráfica y considero que son objetos fundamentales en la cultura y la construcción de imaginarios.
 
La importancia de esta publicación
Creo que el contenido de este libro y su estructura narrativa lo hacen especial. Concebirlo como una obra visual ha sido importante, me ha dado soltura de pensamiento y he podido narrar esta historia acudiendo a todos los lenguajes que me han parecido necesarios. Genero contenido, edito y diseño al mismo tiempo; esta coincidencia ha posibilitado una libertad narrativa que sería imposible de otra manera y que estoy segura ayudará a hacer de este libro un objeto distinto.
Los textos que encargué y los autores que contacté reflejan mis búsquedas. Ellos son personas con que me he encontrado a raíz de lecturas, estudios o sensibilidades en común, todos relacionados con la naturaleza de una u otra manera: Alejandra Vega, doctora en Historia, escribió sobre el Códice Badiano; Kester Bull, botánico, está escribiendo sobre el trabajo taxonómico y la evolución de las especies; Catalina Valdés, doctora en Ciencias Sociales, escribe sobre las biogeografías y Jorge Mpodozis, Neurobiólogo de la Universidad de Chile, sobre naturalismo y percepción. También habrá un texto mío que sirve de introducción. 
Estoy trabajando para que este objeto sea una bitácora de viajes mentales y físicos, un ayuda memoria que vincula mi propia biogeografía con los imaginarios colectivos de nuestra historia.
Este libro se imprimirá en imprenta Ograma, con ellos he trabajado toda la vida como diseñadora, son personas con las que tengo una larga relación de confianza y se especializan en proyectos de alta calidad.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, I'm Jason. I'm the author of this series and other projects. Ghost Story is my second full length novel and will be the second title under the Gestalt Media banner.</p>
<p>(<a href=""https://www.Gestalt-Media.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.Gestalt-Media.com</a>).</p>
<p>I've been writing seriously for a little over ten years now and since Watcher has received such a warm welcome I'm following that up with this story. It's a spookier, darker, more intimate tale aimed at confronting the things we all try to leave behind and what happens when the dead refuse to stay buried.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is something I've been holding close to the vest since I began writing seriously. Watcher was the first book that was ready to come out and was the first to get published because of that but Ghost Story is the one I've been waiting to put down more than anything else. It means the world to me and the future volumes will explore things I've been excited to bring to the world for a very long time. First we have to get out there and let Ghost story: The Road Home get the journey started.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Contribution to this campaign means I can finally bring these characters to life in the way I originally envisioned. It's more than the design and formatting (which is a huge bonus) it covers licensing fees and the cost of procuring rights to other creator's projects that play a key role in the story's development. On my own, this would be a very tall task so you guys really are vital to what I'm doing here.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Breaking in down into more detail:</p>
<p>The funding breaks down pretty easy. As an indie author costs associated with producing a quality novel are high and we count on sales to cover those costs. Sometimes sales fall short, sometimes they take years to recoup. With funding out the door from generous supporters like yourself we can cover things like:</p>
<p>Formatting: The cost of creating a proof with proper indentation, alignment, font design, page collation, etc.</p>
<p>Design: This includes original cover artwork, layout and aesthetic decisions</p>
<p>Set-up fees: Printers require fees to set up new titles</p>
<p>Rights Procurement: Anytime an author uses someone else's work in their creation it requires a licensing fee or a royalty payment.</p>
<p>Proofs: Final test copies to ensure the highest quality final product.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All of this gets done and you get exclusive access to the project, special backer only perks and the chance to become part of the project itself.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm really excited about some of the perks we're offering. For starters, every backer to this project is going to get an ebook copy of Ghost Story. It's a great story and everyone will get to enjoy that. Also every single backer will be included on the acknowledgements page because without you this really wouldn't be possible.</p>
<p>Next, I'm also including my first novel, Watcher in ebook and autographed paperback editions at most levels of funding so you can have the complete set. Watcher is receiving a new cover as we speak for those editions will have a new look and feel as well.</p>
<p>Something else I'm super excited about is a novella that all early backers receive for signing up to our newsletter but you can get in the higher tiers as well. <strong>Apt. 5</strong> is another ghost story but with a twist. This was written while I lived in Norfolk in the Ghent district off the Chesapeake Bay and is based entirely on true events. The few that have read it have been justifiably creeped out. I think you'll love it too.</p>
<p>Some other less conventional perks involve bridging the gap between creator and the you, who make these projects possible. With that in mind I'm offering four tiers.</p>
<p><strong>The Postcards from the Road</strong> tier includes all the items from the earlier levels and the backer will receive personalized postcards from the novel's main characters at various locations on their journey. These will come over the following months, each with a new destination and a comment from the characters. </p>
<p>The next tier includes all of the lower tier novels and ebooks plus an opportunity to chat with the author (me) live via <strong>Skype</strong>. Ask any questions you have about the book, the process, my favorite pizza dough recipe, anything on your mind. I'd love to talk with you!</p>
<p>Ever want to <strong>be in print</strong>? This is your chance. For two lucky backers, I will capture your likeness and name and include you as a character in an upcoming volume of the series. You might be a ghost, you might be a disgruntled neighbor, you might save the day. Who knows but you'll live on forever, immortalized in the pages of great fiction.</p>
<p>The final tier is one I'm very excited about and hope one of you takes me up on. In this perk, the backer gets to pick one of the six destinations highlighted in Ghost story and <strong>meet me</strong> there (airfare included) where we'll spend the day visiting locations mentioned in the book, discussing how that destination inspired the story and probably having a few drinks, sightseeing, etc. It's a great opportunity to visit a killer location and add a unique flavor to the story, going behind the scenes if you will.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Locations are:</strong></p>
<p>Asheville</p>
<p>New Orleans</p>
<p>Key West</p>
<p>Virginia Beach</p>
<p>Phoenix</p>
<p>Portland</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>So what happens if we don't get funded? Thanks to the creator friendly platform offered by IndieGoGo even if we don't reach the full goal, this project still has the green light. We're going through with it. Whatever perks you've chosen are yours and I will do everything in my power to produce this at the highest possible quality and on time, with a release date of early September. Obviously that will be a lot easier with your support and I thank you so much for doing that.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p>Backing this project will bring to life a project that has been very important to me personally for a very long time but also it sets off a series that will run for the foreseeable future. The first three books in the Ghost Story series have been plotted and I see great potential to expand even farther beyond that. That means a lot of new places to explore plus a lot of lore and myth to drag into the light and the chance to watch Justin as he progresses through this new life he's chosen, seeking out what haunts him the most.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Nothing in life is without risk but to be completely honest with this project they are very low. IndieGoGo is a flexible platform so whatever funds we raise will go directly into the project, bringing it into the world on time and looking great when it arrives. The story itself is nearing completion. I will begin early edits while the campaign is still running and will start conversing with my designer about the cover and interior concepts soon after. By the time the campaign ends the final manuscript should be out to an editor, cleaning up the text and getting ready for proofing. </p>
<p>Everything is on track to progress right on time. Things do happen but should such a situation occur everyone will receive frequent updates on the updated timeline.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<p>Contributions are what we're all about here but if you can't that doesn't mean you can't help get this project off the ground. I truly appreciate every share and like you can provide. Social media is a powerful tool and your help spreading the word means more than you could ever know. </p>

<h3>AN INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>In <i><strong>Leaving (&amp; Finding) Jesus</strong>,</i> Jason Clark shares his de/reconstructing <i>Emmaus Road</i> faith journey, where he has discovered lasting joy, peace, a confident assurance for today, and hope for the future.</p>
<p>Jason is a bestselling storyteller who writes to reveal the transforming kindness of the love of God in a world traumatized by the religious abuses done in the name of the love of God. </p>
<p>With grace and humor, Jason juxtaposes an inclusive, reconciling, self-giving view of God's love against an excluding, hierarchal, punishment-focused view of God's love.</p>
<p>Based on scripture, recent studies, personal and shared stories, church history, and Jason’s experience as a pastor and relational theologian, <i>Leaving (&amp; finding) Jesus</i> encourages readers to stop building their faith upon the broken foundations of a transactional view of God, and instead, embrace the self-giving love of God that truly transforms our lives and our world.</p>
<p>This book focuses on one life-changing, joy-inducing, world-reconstructing thought; that nothing, absolutely nothing, not life or death, powers or authorities, not present or future, not our understandings, beliefs, systems, or actions, nothing separates us from the reconciling love of God.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHY A PRE-SALES CAMPAIGN?</h3>
<p>Writing a book is an expensive undertaking. Forget the years it takes to write it, there's editing, cover art, and book design, printing, publishing, and marketing.</p>
<p>Because I've been writing for years, I've developed relationships within the publishing world. With my experience and these connections, I can create this book at a lower cost. That means I can finish writing, and produce the book for  --</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>10,000 </strong>(approximately 500 copies pre-sold) provides for editing, cover design, and printing enough copies to fulfill the pre-orders and set the book up with booksellers for future sales within the US.</li></ul>
<p>This pre-order campaign will be a HUGE jump start for this book and message, and also give you a discounted price and early access to the book. It's a win-win!</p>
<p>By contributing to this book project, you'll not only be personally encouraged and empowered to live and love with abandon, but you'll also help thousands of others be encouraged and experience abundant life as well. </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>THE MESSAGE</h3>
<p><strong>The gospel so many of us grew up with?</strong> The <i>good news</i> most of us Westerners know by heart? At its very foundation, it has been built upon a Father who abandons His Son in His greatest moment of need, on a cross.</p>
<p>Separation is a core conviction for most Christians today, for many, our faith is built upon a God who leaves.  A Father w<i>ho looks away</i> is in our songs and our children’s bibles.</p>
<p>But God did not look away <i>(read<a href=""http://afamilystory.org/2014/07/the-father-never-turned-his-back/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> more</a><a href=""http://afamilystory.org/2020/11/the-most-accepted-heresy-on-the-planet/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">)</a></i>.</p>
<p>The idea that God leaves, rejects, or abandons His creation is a myth nearly as old as time. Separation is a lie passed down through the ages and woven into the very fabric of religious thinking. And specifically today, Western Evangelical Christian thinking.</p>
<p>A God who leaves has been propagated by mostly well-intentioned preachers, which has led to dualistic, behavior-focused, hierarchal, thinking. And has ultimately empowered great abuses in the name of God's love.</p>
<p>But there is a fresh de/reconstructing movement taking place within the church. Christians are repenting, they are leaving the abandoning God and all the fruits thereof. They are leaving the angry, retributive Jesus they have been taught about for generations, and realigning with the self-giving reconciling Jesus so powerfully revealed on a cross. </p>
<p>Sixty-five million adults in the U.S. have dropped out of active church attendance and about 2.7 million more are leaving every year. Christians are re-thinking what they've been taught about Christianity, the Bible, and what it means to be a follower of Jesus.</p>
<p>And though this can feel scary and unsettling, and while many leaders are concerned, I believe this is a good and holy thing! And it is my hope this book encourages and empowers us to de/ and reconstruct well.</p>
<p><strong>The gospel of Jesus</strong> has been beautifully expressed in 2 Cor 5:19 <i>""God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting our sins against us.""</i></p>
<p>On a cross, Jesus said,<i> ""Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing. Luke 23:34</i></p>
<p>Then, before His last breath,<i> ""It is Finished”</i></p>
<p>And the veil that represented humanity's enslavement to separation thinking was forever torn. The problem of separation and the fruits thereof were forever settled.</p>
<p>There is no veil between heaven and earth, no veil between God and humanity, God is with us, God is for us, God is within us!</p>
<p>The good news is that there is no shadow of turning, there is no separation in the nature of God. And this book dives headlong into what that means for today.</p>
<p>This book starts at the cross where we exchange a retributive God lens for reconciliation, separation for inclusion. Following the Emmaus Road journey, the book then confronts the church’s participation in dualistic thinking and invites the reader to rethink our approach to scripture, sin, hell, and injustice.</p>
<p>Reconciliation is who God is, oneness and belonging is the finished work of the cross, and all humanity is invited to awaken to this reality.</p>

<p><i>In this book I have not written about God's reconciling nature through a rigid systematic lens, I have written through the lens of relationship.

<p><i>Below is an excerpt from the book.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>LEAVING JESUS (article form)</b></p>
<p>“I am ready to leave Jesus,” she said in an almost threatening way.</p>
<p>I was talking to a friend over the phone. This was nearly the first thing she said at the beginning of a two-hour conversation in which she railed at God for her broken circumstances, deep sorrows, and vast disappointments. She was in incredible emotional pain, a drowning woman thrashing about for something solid to save her, something good, something she could trust, something better than the seemingly indifferent and controlling God she was so angry with. She was devastated and ready to leave her faith.</p>
<p>I listened. I have been in many such conversations over the years.</p>
<p>In these moments I’ve learned it’s not my role to fix things, it’s to simply listen with compassion, hope, and love.</p>
<p>“Holy Spirit, guide my heart and thoughts with your affection.” I prayed quietly and I waited.</p>
<p>In forty-six years of walking with my best friend Jesus, I have plenty of life-changing principles I can pass along; good and wise words. But when someone is drowning in an existential crisis, wise words won’t save them, only love revealed can meet this kind of desperation.</p>
<p>And I’ve learned love wins, love always saves.</p>
<p>Somewhere near an hour and twenty minutes, she came full circle. Like a lawyer who had systematically laid out the evidence that supported her case, she began her closing arguments by repeating her opening thesis. Flailing but exhausted, she stated again, “I am ready to leave Jesus.”</p>
<p>There was a pause. Just enough of a pause.</p>
<p>“I think you should,” I said.</p>
<p>My response wasn’t what she expected and I think it both terrified and further angered her.</p>
<p>“What!” desperation tinged her voice.</p>
<p>I responded, “The Jesus you have been talking about, he’s killing you, I think you should leave him.”</p>
<p>She was quiet for a moment, then, “What are you saying to me?”</p>
<p>“The Jesus that reigns down pain and disappointment to teach you something about his love, the behavior obsessed Jesus who uses shame to manipulate you into doing what he wants, the abusive Jesus you have been describing to me for more than an hour, I think you should leave him. Personally, I left that Jesus a long time ago…</p>
<p>I left the angry justice Jesus who demands retribution for all my sins, who practices distance and separation until I say ‘sorry.’ The Jesus who releases condemnation every day and twice on Sundays, who gets his glory through some form of eternal conscious suffering, yeah we’re no longer friends.</p>
<p>The narcissist Jesus that sits on a throne reveling in my desperate prayers and the insecure worship songs that highlight my need, the controlling Jesus who loves to compare my weakness to his strength, we haven’t hung out in years.</p>
<p>The fickle bi-polar moody Jesus who is happy one day and depressed the next, we don’t even text.</p>
<p>The Republican or Democrat Jesus, the political Jesus, we wouldn’t even share a cab.</p>
<p>I left the unkind, ungenerous, short-tempered, judgmental, punishing Jesus many years ago…”</p>
<p>Yeah, I didn’t give my drowning friend such an extensive list of all the Jesus’ I’ve left, but she got it, she knew the truth when she heard it. Why, because God is love and we are His beloved; because God is a Father and we are His kids; because you recognize Truth as you are being set free.</p>
<p>The rest of our conversation was spent on discovering, and choosing to believe in, an always good, always restoring, always forgiving, never leaving or forsaking, mercy extending, grace transforming Jesus.</p>
<p>I believe we are all on a journey of discovering God; the Triune God that is perfectly revealed through Jesus on a cross reconciling all humanity to Himself not counting our broken thoughts and beliefs about Him against us.</p>
<p>The list of Jesus’ I have left, some folks refer to it as deconstruction or rethinking, or reimagining. Jesus referred to it as repenting.</p>
<p>Repent, change the way you think because the Kingdom is within reach, even closer still, it is within you. (See Matt 3:2 &amp; Luke 17:20)</p>
<p>Repent, exchange the way you think about God with how God thinks about Himself as revealed through Jesus.</p>
<p>Repent, see yourself and your neighbor the way your heavenly Father does.</p>
<p>Repent, He is better than you think, so keep awaking to better thoughts.</p>
<p>I continue to leave my ego-driven Jesus. I continue to leave the Jesus made in the image and likeness of my broken experiences or some preachers fear; the prescribed Jesus of a rebellious fallen mindset. And the more I repent the more clearly I recognize the good news, the gospel; God is love and Jesus never leaves.</p>
<p>Nothing separates me from His love, His great affection, peace, joy, hope, righteousness, forgiveness, grace (see Rom 8).</p>
<p>God is love, so every time I leave my ego-driven, fear-based, shame-focused Jesus, I discover more fully a transforming intimacy with the Jesus that never leaves…</p>

<h3>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h3>
<p><strong>Regarding hitting my early 2022 deadline.</strong><br/>Since COVID, ghostwriting has become a primary source of income. I am currently ghostwriting a book with another project on the horizon. If we pre-sell enough to hit the $10,000 goal, I am hopeful my agent, <a href=""https://thefeddagency.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Fedd Agency</a>, can find this book a publishing deal. That publishing deal would provide a writing advance and would allow me to then commit all my writing time to finish the book within the February 2022 deadline.</p>
<p>However, if we fall short of $10,000 (500 copies pre-sold), I will still push toward that 2022 Feb deadline, but would likely have to split my writing time between this book and another ghostwriting project. That could mean a longer wait for the book release.</p>
<p>Regardless, the book is over half-written, fully outlined, and I am committed to finishing and releasing it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>This book is a passion project, my best yes to my best friend, Jesus. And so, I have written it on spec, or, by faith. But now I am ready and honored to invite you to join me in reaching the finish line.</p>

</div></div>","AN INTRODUCTION
In Leaving (& Finding) Jesus, Jason Clark shares his de/reconstructing Emmaus Road faith journey, where he has discovered lasting joy, peace, a confident assurance for today, and hope for the future.
Jason is a bestselling storyteller who writes to reveal the transforming kindness of the love of God in a world traumatized by the religious abuses done in the name of the love of God. 
With grace and humor, Jason juxtaposes an inclusive, reconciling, self-giving view of God's love against an excluding, hierarchal, punishment-focused view of God's love.
Based on scripture, recent studies, personal and shared stories, church history, and Jason’s experience as a pastor and relational theologian, Leaving (& finding) Jesus encourages readers to stop building their faith upon the broken foundations of a transactional view of God, and instead, embrace the self-giving love of God that truly transforms our lives and our world.
This book focuses on one life-changing, joy-inducing, world-reconstructing thought; that nothing, absolutely nothing, not life or death, powers or authorities, not present or future, not our understandings, beliefs, systems, or actions, nothing separates us from the reconciling love of God.
 
WHY A PRE-SALES CAMPAIGN?
Writing a book is an expensive undertaking. Forget the years it takes to write it, there's editing, cover art, and book design, printing, publishing, and marketing.
Because I've been writing for years, I've developed relationships within the publishing world. With my experience and these connections, I can create this book at a lower cost. That means I can finish writing, and produce the book for  --

10,000 (approximately 500 copies pre-sold) provides for editing, cover design, and printing enough copies to fulfill the pre-orders and set the book up with booksellers for future sales within the US.
This pre-order campaign will be a HUGE jump start for this book and message, and also give you a discounted price and early access to the book. It's a win-win!
By contributing to this book project, you'll not only be personally encouraged and empowered to live and love with abandon, but you'll also help thousands of others be encouraged and experience abundant life as well.

THE MESSAGE
The gospel so many of us grew up with? The good news most of us Westerners know by heart? At its very foundation, it has been built upon a Father who abandons His Son in His greatest moment of need, on a cross.
Separation is a core conviction for most Christians today, for many, our faith is built upon a God who leaves.  A Father who looks away is in our songs and our children’s bibles.
But God did not look away (read more).
The idea that God leaves, rejects, or abandons His creation is a myth nearly as old as time. Separation is a lie passed down through the ages and woven into the very fabric of religious thinking. And specifically today, Western Evangelical Christian thinking.
A God who leaves has been propagated by mostly well-intentioned preachers, which has led to dualistic, behavior-focused, hierarchal, thinking. And has ultimately empowered great abuses in the name of God's love.
But there is a fresh de/reconstructing movement taking place within the church. Christians are repenting, they are leaving the abandoning God and all the fruits thereof. They are leaving the angry, retributive Jesus they have been taught about for generations, and realigning with the self-giving reconciling Jesus so powerfully revealed on a cross. 
Sixty-five million adults in the U.S. have dropped out of active church attendance and about 2.7 million more are leaving every year. Christians are re-thinking what they've been taught about Christianity, the Bible, and what it means to be a follower of Jesus.
And though this can feel scary and unsettling, and while many leaders are concerned, I believe this is a good and holy thing! And it is my hope this book encourages and empowers us to de/ and reconstruct well.
The gospel of Jesus has been beautifully expressed in 2 Cor 5:19 ""God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself, not counting our sins against us.""
On a cross, Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, for they know not what they are doing. Luke 23:34
Then, before His last breath, ""It is Finished”
And the veil that represented humanity's enslavement to separation thinking was forever torn. The problem of separation and the fruits thereof were forever settled.
There is no veil between heaven and earth, no veil between God and humanity, God is with us, God is for us, God is within us!
The good news is that there is no shadow of turning, there is no separation in the nature of God. And this book dives headlong into what that means for today.
This book starts at the cross where we exchange a retributive God lens for reconciliation, separation for inclusion. Following the Emmaus Road journey, the book then confronts the church’s participation in dualistic thinking and invites the reader to rethink our approach to scripture, sin, hell, and injustice.
Reconciliation is who God is, oneness and belonging is the finished work of the cross, and all humanity is invited to awaken to this reality.

THE BOOK TRAILER


 
THIS BOOK CONFRONTS

For too long Christians have been taught to build their faith upon the trust compromising belief in a God who leaves. This has led to,

a dualistic, for or against thinking, that practices exclusion, and is used to justify violence, control, racism, sexism...
a retributive view of God that defines hell as God's ultimate form of justice.  
a hierarchal elitist approach to leadership that is complicit with rampant spiritual and emotional abuse.
an inability to release reconciliation or speak authentically to issues of inequality.
a spirituality that condemns anyone who does not hold to an unwavering defense of the doctrine of biblical inerrancy.
an institutional approach to community that is unaccepting of differences in beliefs, cultures, socioeconomic backgrounds, religions, or races and promotes isolation and tribalism.

 
THIS BOOK IMPACTS 
I believe this book will have a profound impact on the

millions of Christians who are exhausted by the politics of nationalism, socialism, or any other ism; the ‘for or against,’ paradigm that seems to rule and define the Christian narrative today.
those spiritually moving from a transactional approach to God defined by adhering to a set of beliefs, and moving toward a relational approach to God defined by self-giving love.
those who are theologically rejecting the image of God as a violent, retributive, controlling Being, and embracing the image of God as the kind, reconciling and renewing Spirit at work within us and our world for good.
the faithful followers of Jesus who no longer identify with organized religion but are passionate about the work of reconciliation.



 
A BRIEF EXCERPT
For those unfamiliar with my writing...
I am not a systematic theologian with letters in front of his name. I am a relational theologian; a son, a husband, a father, a brother, a friend – I am loved and I love. 
In this book I have not written about God's reconciling nature through a rigid systematic lens, I have written through the lens of relationship. I don't approach God through disciplines, ethics, and the dogma of religious thought; I approach God as an adored son of my Father, a beloved brother of Jesus, an intimate friend of Holy Spirit. 
I have written to share what I am discovering about the perfection of God's love that you might be empowered to grow in your own discovery of God's love.
Below is an excerpt from the book.
 
LEAVING JESUS (article form)
“I am ready to leave Jesus,” she said in an almost threatening way.

This book isn’t just sweet and charming, its important. So few children’s books featuring diversity go beyond the notion that its okay to be different. In this story Sage knows she’s different and never thinks anything of it. Each of her grandmothers explains the word biracial to her in their own way so she has the vocabulary to describe her life. I believe this distinction has value because if little black and brown children only see themselves in books reassuring them its okay to be different, they aren’t given room to explore and relate to storytelling beyond that point.


The AuthorsMy Grandma Linda and I had the idea for I Love Grandma’s House when I was just seven years old. Now, eighteen years later we’re making that dream a reality.

Working with oils, acrylics, gel mediums, wood, and found objects, I move from vision to execution with whatever materials strike me in that creative moment.

<h3>What's all this, then?</h3>
<p>Grab your dice or lightsabers and suit up, folks: we're now casting for key players in COSGRRRL's triumphant entrance into the glorious world of print, with its first ever five issue series: Elemental. Part literary magazine, part pop culture manifesto, and illustrated just enough to engage the third grade reader in you, COSGRRRL is on a mission. <strong>To fight evil. To geek out. To save the world.</strong></p>
<p>Haven't you ever wanted to save the world? Well now you can: by snatching up COSGRRRL's first limited edition, signed print issues like they were bottled water during the apocalypse. <i>How, exactly, is supporting COSGRRRL's print launch the same as saving the world</i>, you ask?</p>
<p>Well, it's complicated, but suffice to say we here at COSGRRRL have worked it all out, and it has to do with <strong>being strong in our intellectual diversity</strong>, and <strong>talking about the things we love</strong>, and the fact that science fiction and fantasy are far superior (as far as topics go) to politics and news and religion on account of the fact that <strong>sci-fi and fantasy force us to explore our humanity and new frontiers of being</strong> while politics and news and religion just makes us want to smell our own belly button lint like Neanderthals. It's also a little bit about manifestation, and the idea that <strong>if we get a bunch of people who are different together talking about what they love, we're bound to solve more problems</strong> than we would shouting at each other all the godsdamned time.</p>
<p>And anyway, do YOU have a better idea for saving the world? You don't, do you? Well, then, my idea is as good as any, and it's a pretty damn cheap bet at just $25 per issue. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If that's not enough reason:</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> we use cool ""A"" words like “Afrocentrism” and “Anarchy”, and we shit-talk the Disney Channel, and write fanfiction according to our own particular...idiom. Yes, unfortunately, there IS a little bit of poetry in these issues too, but don’t hold that against the entire franchise. There are also velociraptors and copious uses of the “N” word in the fiction section, so the pace always picks back up again. </span></p>
<p>Also, you KNOW you feel guilty for not reading more books. <strong>Well this issue is LIKE a book</strong>, in that it has many smart words, <strong>but UNLIKE a book</strong>, in that it’s shorter and <strong>includes some very interesting pictures indeed</strong>. </p>

<h3>CENSORED FROM MEDIUM (also: poetry, dinosaurs, and space)</h3>
<p>Yes, it's true, one of our comedic authors has had his works scrubbed from Medium.com on account of ""inappropriate content"". What was inappropriate about it? Well, you'd like to know, wouldn't you? But you won't--not unless you buy COSGRRRL: the Elemental Series. Let's see if you can pick their work out from the Table of Contents posted at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Controversial comedy isn't all that's in COSGRRRL, though--<strong>each issue is packed with Essays which critically analyze, Reviews which entertain, Cospoetry that scratches your brain, and Fiction that tickles your spine</strong>. All from a mix of new writers, established voices, and previously undiscovered geniuses.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why are you fundraising, and what are you going to do with my money?</h3>
<p>Our pro bono CFO has made very fancy spreadsheets detailing revenue and expenses he calls a ""P&amp;L"" (whatever that means), which performs some very magical calculations to tell us how much it costs to print issues, and how many we need to print and sell in order to make any money on this whole messy publishing affair. Our Magical Money Spreadsheet tells us that in order <strong>to cover our upfront costs to produce, print, and sell the first two issues</strong> at a volume which creates a reasonable profit, <strong>COSGRRRL needs $25,000</strong>.</p>
<p>Once Issue #1 is printed, revenue from their sales (from COSGRRRL's own webstore, once this Indiegogo campaign has wrapped) will fund the production/printing of Issue #3, and so on through Issue #5.</p>
<p>As for why we're fundraising: Marjorie is flat broke, yo.</p>
<h3>Yikes! That sounds hard. What if failure, tho?</h3>
<p>Great question, Eskimo Dog: we shall not fail.</p>
<p>I mean, worst case scenario we don't raise money or sell issues as fast as we'd planned, and it takes longer for the issues to be released than anticipated.</p>
<p>But that's one of the reasons why our fundraising goal is based on the costs of two issues, rather than just the first one--to give us more of a cushion of inventory from which to build profit.</p>
<p>And anyway, isn't everything a risk, at the end of the day? Why the hell not try? We can promise you this publication has been more thoroughly strategized and analyzed than 80% of the other literary presses out there. Academic presses running off department funding can eat COSGRRRL's crunchy shorts.</p>

<h3>Pour me that Kool-Aid! How can I help?</h3>
<p>Well, back the project here on Indiegogo by <strong>buying the VIP Subscription to the entire five-issue series</strong>, of course.</p>
<p>And tip any extra cash you have lying around into the ""Contributions"" bucket, while you're at it. <strong>Extra contributions help us pay for artwork and print issues sooner. </strong></p>
<p>Tipping in an extra contribution is also a great way to show you value COSGRRRL--and Marjorie's journalism and publishing work at large.</p>
<p>If you're not Scrooge McDuck right now and the VIP Subscription pack is too steep (or if you have really morbid sensibilities and are concerned about any of us being alive by the time issues #2-5 are released), <strong>buy a VIP Issue package--or at least a single signed issue</strong>.</p>
<p>If that's just not feasible, never fear: <strong>use the Interwebs to ask other people to buy it for you!</strong> For a good cause! And to buy a whole godsdamned subscription for themselves while they're at it, because hey, they'll love it--and even if they don't, they'll have original, post-post modern fucking literature in their house, which they can set on their coffee table during parties to make people believe they're super artsy and woke.</p>

<i>""He stopped by our house frequently for many months.</i><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">   <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">They had told me in broad strokes who he was...trained as a painter in Paris at a pretegious school, the  son of a well to do family. He had an educated, gentle demeanor, and polite manner of speech.  I liked him well enough, he was gentle and genuine. There was obviously a problem though.  His cheeks had gone too gaunt probably some time ago; but Id only met him more recently, so I didnt have the before and after photograph of him in my mind . </span></span>
</h3>
<div>    After about the third time he stop by I caught on. Still wearing the same outfit, caring the same  shoulder bag , and wearing that same nervous demeanor, like wet clothes that cling to your skin uncomfortably.  The first time he asked for anything, it was for a shower. That's when it hit home for me. I got it. Over the next few months he'd stop in about three times a week, ask if he could use the bathroom sheepishly, ask for a piece of paper, and ask if he could draw a portrait of me.  Some days I would sit for him in the passageway sunshine , my children playing nearby,while he drew. His proficient pencil, quickly  flashing  easily and intensely on the drugged paper.  </div>
<div>    Looking back I think he did them, and left it as a form of re payment. Back then it seemed like maybe he just ""needed to draw"" . We all knew who he was,  and respected him deeply, even in his emaciated shaking state.  I'd offer him food which he  usually declined. It seemed almost unbearable for him to accept anything, or ask for anything.  Watching him was torturous, his sinewy body in complete discomfort, wiggling as though he wanted to slip right out of it.  </div>
<div>    I looked forward to the days when he would stop by. Maybe that sounds wrong to say but, I felt honored he trusted me that much and felt that comfortable enough to come by, which seemed  like a feat  in itself.  I was grateful he did because it also meant I knew he was still OK.  Then came a week where he didn't come. Then  two weeks. I tracked down a telephone number for  his family and spoke with his aunt, but she wouldn't tell me anything.  I explained to her my friendship with him but that didn't help pull out any answers. I never saw him again.  He left me with some beautiful sketches, done by the hand of a true master. I'm assuming he's dead , but anybody I ever ask never heard anything more either.</div>
<div> Not all the stories of people who came by that house are sad ones we had so many  real winners too, and those ones leave me smiling.</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>Moving,  but also sometimes  humorous, rich stories that took place over many years , come together to create this honest and raw memoir. The book is  full of anecdotal stories on the ervolutionary  avant-garde Art movement that shaped and  gave me standing as an artist. But also of social advocacy, experiences of peace, war, drugs, birth, death, family, violence againt women, charity, healing, resiliance, perseverance, compassion, poverty, wealth and much more. </div>

It is a piece of history.  Not only my own history, it is a legacy which belongs to my children, family,  my community, my peers and world and you. . </div>
<div><b><i>Why its so important</i></b></div>
<div><span> Before beginning this book I put  out a long chain of queries  about the significance and importance of this book, (in essence if this  story had in fact been relevant,  I spoke with journalists, artists, cinematographers, collectors, Gallery's, peers,  and other professionals who were not in the inner circle of this revolutionary  art movement, but rather experienced it together with us from an outside vantage point. I did so in order to establish whether or not the work we did during this time truly influenced.  I already knew from my point of view, and that of my peers that it was and has been important for all of us, but I needed to know  as well from external sources, to see if my observations were correct. <b>The answer was unanimously yes</b>. We were in fact a group of  highly motivated, inspired, active, hard-working, dedicated, young dreamers with both cause and mission.   The payoff was and has been monumental.  What we managed to accomplish did change the course of art history in Guatemala as well as  having huge social impact, and continues to do so to this day. </span></div>
<div><span> We created both an outstanding group, and individual reputation  for ourselves. That reputation has carrtied  based on the accomplishments and achievements nationally and internationally.  Working from the ground up has been and remains an essential aspect. Remaining  true to both the culture and people of this country, this work holds firmly to its original roots, concepts and ideas. </span></div>

</div></div>","""He stopped by our house frequently for many months.   They had told me in broad strokes who he was...trained as a painter in Paris at a pretegious school, the  son of a well to do family. He had an educated, gentle demeanor, and polite manner of speech.  I liked him well enough, he was gentle and genuine. There was obviously a problem though.  His cheeks had gone too gaunt probably some time ago; but Id only met him more recently, so I didnt have the before and after photograph of him in my mind . 

    After about the third time he stop by I caught on. Still wearing the same outfit, caring the same  shoulder bag , and wearing that same nervous demeanor, like wet clothes that cling to your skin uncomfortably.  The first time he asked for anything, it was for a shower. That's when it hit home for me. I got it. Over the next few months he'd stop in about three times a week, ask if he could use the bathroom sheepishly, ask for a piece of paper, and ask if he could draw a portrait of me.  Some days I would sit for him in the passageway sunshine , my children playing nearby,while he drew. His proficient pencil, quickly  flashing  easily and intensely on the drugged paper.  
    Looking back I think he did them, and left it as a form of re payment. Back then it seemed like maybe he just ""needed to draw"" . We all knew who he was,  and respected him deeply, even in his emaciated shaking state.  I'd offer him food which he  usually declined. It seemed almost unbearable for him to accept anything, or ask for anything.  Watching him was torturous, his sinewy body in complete discomfort, wiggling as though he wanted to slip right out of it.  
    I looked forward to the days when he would stop by. Maybe that sounds wrong to say but, I felt honored he trusted me that much and felt that comfortable enough to come by, which seemed  like a feat  in itself.  I was grateful he did because it also meant I knew he was still OK.  Then came a week where he didn't come. Then  two weeks. I tracked down a telephone number for  his family and spoke with his aunt, but she wouldn't tell me anything.  I explained to her my friendship with him but that didn't help pull out any answers. I never saw him again.  He left me with some beautiful sketches, done by the hand of a true master. I'm assuming he's dead , but anybody I ever ask never heard anything more either.
 Not all the stories of people who came by that house are sad ones we had so many  real winners too, and those ones leave me smiling.


Moving,  but also sometimes  humorous, rich stories that took place over many years , come together to create this honest and raw memoir. The book is  full of anecdotal stories on the ervolutionary  avant-garde Art movement that shaped and  gave me standing as an artist. But also of social advocacy, experiences of peace, war, drugs, birth, death, family, violence againt women, charity, healing, resiliance, perseverance, compassion, poverty, wealth and much more. 
 An excerpt from the Memoir





Funding this project  

•  publication of this book in November of 2016. 
•   funds the aquisition of a used computer for the writing, 
•   Helps cover the research trip to speak with historians, curators, journalists,   activists and peers in the art movement I was/ am a part of . 
•    creates suplimentary monies in carrying  my family of four children while I also work  on the writing, editing, and publishing of the book






Who and what youre helping


 You are a part of this story .  In reaching out to you you also become a part of  my story and my life. You are helping me plant this story into writing and publish. It is a piece of history.  Not only my own history, it is a legacy which belongs to my children, family,  my community, my peers and world and you. . 
Why its so important
 Before beginning this book I put  out a long chain of queries  about the significance and importance of this book, (in essence if this  story had in fact been relevant,  I spoke with journalists, artists, cinematographers, collectors, Gallery's, peers,  and other professionals who were not in the inner circle of this revolutionary  art movement, but rather experienced it together with us from an outside vantage point. I did so in order to establish whether or not the work we did during this time truly influenced.  I already knew from my point of view, and that of my peers that it was and has been important for all of us, but I needed to know  as well from external sources, to see if my observations were correct. The answer was unanimously yes. We were in fact a group of  highly motivated, inspired, active, hard-working, dedicated, young dreamers with both cause and mission.   The payoff was and has been monumental.  What we managed to accomplish did change the course of art history in Guatemala as well as  having huge social impact, and continues to do so to this day. 
 We created both an outstanding group, and individual reputation  for ourselves. That reputation has carrtied  based on the accomplishments and achievements nationally and internationally.  Working from the ground up has been and remains an essential aspect. Remaining  true to both the culture and people of this country, this work holds firmly to its original roots, concepts and ideas. 

 


Guatemala changed me...


It also gave me a place and a name. With over 22 years working in and with artistic social projects. An artist, a mother, a social advocate, an activist, a teacher and continual cultural pioneer. I have  worked internationally and studied therapeutic approaches with diverse communities, including the elderly, drug addicts, and children and adults with disabilities. I have worked organizing and hosting cultural events, founded and co founded cultural initiatives and is an award winning exhibiting artist since 1995. CV and work can be seen HERE

I currently reside in upsate NY, am a full time mother of four children, a full time employee, artist, do ongoing works of art in the studio. And...to boot it is also usual I also have these types of additional projects going, like writing this book


 How we changed a nation ?


 Sometimes you have to look back to move forward Art BOOMED in the USA during the 50s to 70s and gave us so many of North Americas most beloved artists.  Too many to name we got the likes of Ed Ruscha, Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Basquiat, the Beats,  Gerard Malanga, Hans Namuth, poets, sculptors, filmmakers, photographers, musicians et all. It happened in Guatemala too but in the 1990's, and thats where I was. 

 Iconic Poet/Photographer Gerard Malanga at my studio 2009

In the right place at the right time, and no matter how lost to translation it may seem, it was the equivalent of being in the US during the 50s-70s . It is a rare and unique experience that few countries or artists in the world will still go through. as a developing country it simply had not gone through this process, but I was there for it when it happened. A once in a life time experience of a country and a people. This is her story, their story.  



The Domino effect 

 Because of this story is about Guatemala, it belongs to Guatemala. This is why  I have chosen to pay my work forward. The initiative for the school in the Ixil triangle run by Lucia Escobar. Internationally renown Guatemalan journalist, Lucia has published awarded articles on Femecidio  (The re occurring  killing of women in Guatemala), who, in her ""spare time"" ( besides recently being widowed, and is now a single mother raising two boys)  helps this particular Ixil school in  the very north of Guatemala where entire villages were massacred. ( Nobel Peace Winner Rigoberta Minchu can tell you all about it, Read her story too. )  giving the proceeds to Lucia's efforts with the children in the Ixil Triangle. Its a legitimate thing she is doing even if it looks low key and unprofessional, its real, and true.

<h3>Spooner's Impact</h3> <p>Spooner the Bear has a real chance to connect with and convey a message to its audience:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the ongoing issue across America of bears coming into urban areas to seek food will continue to occur unless people become educated in safe garbage storage</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">it doesn't matter where in the world you live, people leave litter lying around. </span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Spooner acts as a messenger and a role model to help kids from an early age understand the consequences of littering and garbage storage. The book also instills, in the parents reading it, a message that has been in front of them the whole time but may have been missed due to the methods by which this information has, in the past, been transmitted. Having spent the past 3 years reading board books to my son I have gained a great understanding of how a simple message in a kid's book sticks with me, especially when I end up reading the same book over and over again. I soon realized that this was a great conduit for passing on important information.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why I Wrote Spooner the Bear</h3> <p>Having spent the past 7 years filming urban bears foraging for food in neighborhoods around Lake Tahoe, Carson City and Reno, Nevada I felt a strong urge to do something more than just produce films about the issue. Why? Because as these bears get more and more used to being in urban areas they get less afraid of humans and that's when the trouble starts. If a bear gets bold enough to break into your home it can become very dangerous. Imagine waking up, walking to the kitchen to get your coffee and there in front of you is a hungry bear foraging through your cupboards. THIS HAPPENS! And when a bear becomes that bold it becomes a threat to human safety and ... you can imagine the rest!</p>
<p>I believe this little children's board book can help instill an important message in a way that hasn't been used before. My GOAL is to get kids to grow up understanding this issue and nag their parents to DO THE RIGHT THING!</p>
<p>But also I thought it would be cool to write a fun kids book!</p>

<div>
<p>Reviewed by Jack Magnus for Readers' Favorite </p>
<p>Spooner the Bear is a children’s animal/picture book written by Jake Willers and illustrated by Lainie Bazzoni. Spooner is a young bear who lives quite close to a small town. The other local bears have gotten used to the idea of getting their food from the trash cans sitting outside the houses every night, and they make a terrible mess as they overturn the cans in their search for treats. Spooner and his friend, Fitzgerald the squirrel, travel to all the nearby towns looking for the messes the marauding bears leave and cleaning them up. At one point, they meet up with a giant bear named Rex, whose stomach is full of garbage from the cans he’s raided. Spooner tells Rex that he’s doing it all wrong. Bears should eat berries and greens, not garbage. Spooner also has a message for the humans he helps each night. If they use bear-proof containers, the bears would leave their garbage alone, and he and Fitzgerald could enjoy themselves at the lake instead of always having to clean up.<br/><br/>Jake Willers’ children’s animal/picture book, Spooner the Bear, is an entertaining and informative book about ways to make co-existence between people and bears work. Bears can’t resist the smells and tastes that exude from those garbage cans, and the resulting mess and unwanted interaction between species can easily be prevented. Lainie Bazzoni’s illustrations are superb! I love the colors and images of the natural places that she portrays, especially those featuring the lake and hillsides. Each panel is brightly and boldly colored, and the bears are a treat to look at, especially Spooner and the giant Rex. This book teaches kids and their parents about bears and how human food and trash is a big lure for them. Spooner the Bear is most highly recommended.</p>

<h3>Note: International Shipping</h3>
<div>Unfortunately to ship this board book overseas is very expensive due to its thickness and weight. There is an option for international shipping to the UK but it's twice the price of the book (yes that's the real shipping cost from the US to the UK not even taking into account the packaging costs). I am currently looking at getting 50 copies into the UK and shipping to buyers directly from there to reduce this cost. Please check the updates page for more info as I get this arranged.</div>
</div></div>","Who is Spooner? 

Spooner the Bear is a children's picture book that tells the story of Spooner, a young bear who's determined to change the trash-eating habits of his fellow neighborhood furry friends, and with any luck educate a few humans along the way! 
A message is being cunningly transmitted via Spooner the Bear. While engaging children in the richly-colored pages and neatly woven storyline, a hard-hitting message is being driven home to the parents – here’s a bear stating, from his point of view, what steps must be taken to stop his urban counterparts coming to forage in our trash cans and adversely affecting their health! This is a novel approach to a persistent dilemma, namely getting the message across to those with the power to do something about it, and this little tome does it by connecting kids and adults simultaneously. Growing up with the idea of safe trash-storage is a positive step for the future. Here’s the take-home message: WE create the problem, it’s up to US to solve it – perhaps with the aid of Spooner!
But, you don't need bears in your neighborhood to enjoy Spooner the Bear. The story and illustrations are hugely appealing as a fun kid's book regardless of where you live in the world. The story's theme, however, is also relevant to all urban wildlife species where animals seek food in our neighborhoods.
Here are a few of the beautiful illustrations from the book:

</div></div>","Who We Are
 As a podcaster on the Crime Cafe, I've had the pleasure of interviewing many great crime fiction and thriller authors. Thirteen of them have agreed to collaborate with me in creating two collective works. The authors contributing their books to the boxed set include:  Austin Camacho, Donna Fletcher Crow, W.D. Gagliani, Dale T. Phillips, M. Ruth Myers, Benjamin Sobieck, Jim Winter, Kenneth Wishnia, and Frank Zafiro. Our anthology will consist of short stories from: Bill Crider, Sasscer Hill, Jenny Milchman, A.J. Sidransky, and myself, These authors represent a wide-ranging variety of crime fiction fare. If you don't know their work, this represents a great opportunity for you to get to know them and help spread the word to everyone else. 


As crime fiction authors, we use the genre to tell so many different types of stories. The themes of our writing range from the Agatha Christie-style cozy, to the more technical police procedural, as well as the hard-nosed private eye or tough amateur sleuth.
With so many books to read these days, this project provides a curated sample of some of the best crime and noir fiction available.
We are all experienced crime authors, many of whom have won or been nominated for awards.
As a bonus, these collections will include transcribed interviews with each of the authors from my podcast.

I can't begin to say enough about how happy I am to be able to make this project a reality. With your help, I'm sure we'll reach our goal!

All contributors (no matter what level) qualify for our new referral contest. Everyone who contributes in the past, now or during the duration of the contest qualifies.

</div><p>“Enter the world of Thumar in the 25th century. It's a time of incredible technological advancement, but there is a cruel and heartless syndicate at work culling the ""galactic herd."" They are waging an insanely genocidal effort to direct events and create their ideal order for the known universe. ""Thumar"" is just the beginning of an exciting new series.""<br/></p><div>
</div><p>My name is M. Timothy Murray; I am
the author of this new  science fiction novel, the first
of a series. The second book is complete in its first draft form. The third is in progress, 710 pages to date. Writing is a
passion for me. I do it for the love of creating. It brings me joy to present ""new worlds"" for reading pleasure. <br/></p><div>
</div><p>These books are years in the
making with a lot of help from friends and family. Many thanks go out to those
who have helped. Without you, I would not be where I am today.This is a dream that I have done my best to make a reality. You can help me pass this final hurdle and reward you for your participation.<br/></p><div>
</div><p>Thumar is a finished product,
except for the cover art and printing, and will be self-published on Create
Space and Amazon books, and available soon in E-Book form. The purpose of this crowd funding proposal is to raise funds to
have the cover art professionally rendered and to finance a book tour to
promote the sales of the book.</p><div>
</div><p><u>Risks and Challenges</u></p><div>
</div><p>Self-publishing can be a full time
job. With your help, I can aggressively promote this exciting undertaking. My
goal is to tour to
 promote this book. More than one beta reader has commented on
the fact that the book would make a good movie. </p><div>
</div><p>I have spent the last three years
enlisting the help of friends who have taught, or still teach English to refine
my manuscript. I employed beta readers to give me their true
“reader’s perspective.” All of them were positive with honest view points. Many hours with my wife reading to me allowed me to disconnect
momentarily from a writers myopic viewpoint. All of this has helped me in the
editing process. I have done my utmost to present the most professional
product I am able to.</p><div>
</div><p>With your help, success will come
faster for the advertising and publication. Together, we can all win.
Please read the crowd funding
rewards section to carefully determine at which level you would like to
participate</p><div>
</div><p>Your investment will include the creation and printing of professional
book cover art. This is the final step to publication. A website will follow with a blog section, and contact information. Road
trips will be part of
my agenda. With your level of participation, your town, city or home can make
my schedule.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>                                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444940462/fp6go8aeie1oa88dzvdu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/> <p></p><div>

I found Tim Murray’s book “Thumar” a delightful read and I
couldn’t put it down. When I finished the last page, I wanted more…can’t wait
for Tim to come out with his next book.

David Blonsksi ~ Artist, Musician, and owner of Timeless Productions.





“I found this story quite enjoyable. I particularly liked the
character development. I felt like I would recognize the main characters if
they walked into the room. It is refreshing to read a story in which the main
characters make decisions based on what is good for the world (or worlds)
rather than themselves.
John Pearsley ~ MA Biochemistry, Criminalist for the ECPD




“This book is bold and magical indeed.”

About this Project



“Enter the world of Thumar in the 25th century. It's a time of incredible technological advancement, but there is a cruel and heartless syndicate at work culling the ""galactic herd."" They are waging an insanely genocidal effort to direct events and create their ideal order for the known universe. ""Thumar"" is just the beginning of an exciting new series.""
My name is M. Timothy Murray; I am
the author of this new  science fiction novel, the first
of a series. The second book is complete in its first draft form. The third is in progress, 710 pages to date. Writing is a
passion for me. I do it for the love of creating. It brings me joy to present ""new worlds"" for reading pleasure. 
These books are years in the
making with a lot of help from friends and family. Many thanks go out to those
who have helped. Without you, I would not be where I am today.This is a dream that I have done my best to make a reality. You can help me pass this final hurdle and reward you for your participation.
Thumar is a finished product,
except for the cover art and printing, and will be self-published on Create
Space and Amazon books, and available soon in E-Book form. The purpose of this crowd funding proposal is to raise funds to
have the cover art professionally rendered and to finance a book tour to
promote the sales of the book.
Risks and Challenges
Self-publishing can be a full time
job. With your help, I can aggressively promote this exciting undertaking. My
goal is to tour to
 promote this book. More than one beta reader has commented on
the fact that the book would make a good movie. 
I have spent the last three years
enlisting the help of friends who have taught, or still teach English to refine
my manuscript. I employed beta readers to give me their true
“reader’s perspective.” All of them were positive with honest view points. Many hours with my wife reading to me allowed me to disconnect
momentarily from a writers myopic viewpoint. All of this has helped me in the
editing process. I have done my utmost to present the most professional
product I am able to.
With your help, success will come
faster for the advertising and publication. Together, we can all win.
Please read the crowd funding
rewards section to carefully determine at which level you would like to
participate
Your investment will include the creation and printing of professional
book cover art. This is the final step to publication. A website will follow with a blog section, and contact information. Road
trips will be part of
my agenda. With your level of participation, your town, city or home can make
my schedule.

Just then, two phase
blasts hit The Armstrong, one just aft of the bridge and another port
side, at mid-ship. The bridge exploded with debris, everyone was slammed into
something solid or found themselves on
the deck. Commander Morgan rose first with blood dripping from a head wound. He
still had his senses about him. Captain Arnold lay bleeding on the deck, along with half of the bridge crew.

                                                                                                   “Mikal! We just received a message from HQ on screen. It’s

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Hello Friend, my name is Bassey Efiok and I am the
author of “DAILY PRAISE AND PRAYER”; a popular book that’s empowering many to
easily connect with God and find true peace and joy through effective praise and prayer.
The book brings you a collection of powerful praises and prayers that you can
use anytime to praise God freely and passionately and to pray effectively so
that you can receive answers for your needs.</span><br/></p>
<p>The book was released just last year, yet it has greatly inspired many lives. Most
of the readers who have communicated with me are so excited about the
book that they are asking for more contents: They are asking for more praises and prayers with broader coverage to meet most human needs and desires</p>
<p>For these reasons, I have launched this project to create a new and
expanded edition of Daily Praise and Prayer. I envision a new edition of a daily devotional published in BOOK, VIDEO and eBOOK formats in full color with photos and graphics.  It will be very exciting, very precious, very rewarding, easy to read and a keepsake to readers. </p>
<p>But as excited as I am about creating this book, I
realize that I very much need your support. I’ll very much
appreciate your financial support to help cover the cost of creating and
publishing this book. Knowing that
there is a community of people like you out there participating in creating
this book and waiting for it’s debut, strengthens me much to get it over the
finish line. It will feel like it is “our book” and not just “my book.”</p>

What We Need and How You Can Help

1. Financial Support. I will very much appreciate your generous financial support to help
pay for the cost of professionally creating and producing this book. Kindly

Even if this fundraising campaign does not reach its target, the project will still be be completed because I will  find other ways to raise additional funds. I have already dedicated numerous hours and funds to the writing aspect of the book.

around the world for the hand engraved Inlay Art that I put on the necks of my

<p>In 2003 the first book about my Inlay Art, “A Guitarmaker’s
Canvas—The Inlay Art Of Grit Laskin” was published by Backbeat Books of
California.  That book sold out its print
run and is no longer available in its original form. </p>
<p>For the last three and half years I have been working on a
follow-up volume to that book.  This time
I am focusing on 50 complex Inlay projects that have been completed over the
last 13 years.  This new book, an
oversize, hard-cover, coffee-table book with a primary title of “GRAND
COMPLICATIONS”, will be a much more in-depth look at my creative process, as
well as being filled with more than 400 images. 
</p>
<p>The focus of this book is really to pull back the curtain on
my process of creating the design, of responding to clients’ ideas and
illustrating their stories.  Here’s an
except from the book’s Preface, which makes that point:</p>
<p> <i> [I’m on the phone, long distance,
with a client.  I’ve reached the point in
the construction of this guitar that a decision on the theme of the inlay must
be made.  </i></p>
<p><i>“Ummmm…” he
says, then pauses, “Peace! That’s what I want. 
Do something on Peace.”  </i></p>
<p><i>“Okay,
Okay…sure.  I can do that, “ I reply.
“But what are you seeing when you say the word ‘Peace’?”</i></p>
<p><i>“Oh, nothing
specific,” he answers.  “I want to see
what you come up with.”</i></p>
<p><i>  I hang up.  My mind is immediately swamped with images of
people, places, events, all in some way or other linked to my sense of the word
‘Peace’.  Simultaneously my left brain is
deluging me with questions: Do I know enough about this client to be able to
guess his sympathies?  His nation is
currently at war—what if I make too bold an anti-war statement with my
design?  Will I offend him? Please him? I
think he’s old enough to have participated in or protested the war in
Vietnam—should I pull images from that era? 
From today?  from the Occupy
Movement?  and on and on.</i></p>
<p><i>  Sometimes the creative freedom
offered by a client like this is a blessing, sometimes a curse.  Polar opposite from this are clients who
bombard me with so many disparate themes and concepts, in email after email, phone
call after phone call, that this can equally be both a blessing and a
curse.  Yes, I may be given much to work
with but how do I extract only the right elements from another person’s very
personal experiences? How do I distil a novel’s worth of their themes and
digressions into a film script, with a focused central narrative?] </i></p>
<p>GRAND COMPLICATIONS will take the reader on a journey into

through the difficulties and successes, hitting stumbling blocks but then following

<p><b>Why Am I Fundraising?</b></p>
<p>The short answer is that this will be an expensive book to
produce.  And in current times,
arrangements with publishers of this kind of book require it to be a
co-production, in which we share the editing, design and printing costs and
they do the marketing and promotion.  I
do have a publisher involved, FIGURE 1, based in Vancouver, BC, and they have
distribution around the world.</p>
<p>As some visual artist friends have explained to me, this publishing model has always existed in the art world.

</div></div>","American Female: a true tale of adventure I'm Emily, a Saint Louis, MO native, author, producer, creative, and doer. I've devoted the past three years of my life to writing, editing, and creating American Female: a true tale of adventure. It is the next Great American Novel, best described as ""The Devil Wears Prada"" meets ""Eat, Pray, Love"" while ""On the Road,"" and filled with action, adventure, passion, scandal, and self-actualization.
Middle-class, mid-career, and Midwestern, twenty-something Emily Carpenter walks into a new job that isn’t middle anything. In only slightly more time than it takes to get a passport, this brave adventuress finds herself thrust into a world of lavish luxury, corporate hijinks, and personal scandal. Jet-setting around the globe with her sociopathic boss, she discovers the line between right and wrong is generally negotiable, and almost always in a language other than English. Forced to her breaking point, Emily has to decide what is more important: her old self-respect or her new career. But first - she’ll have to survive.



Teamwork Makes the Dream Work
This true tale of adventure demands to be shared, so I've teamed up with a talented group of creatives to make it happen.




Our collaboration resulted in some incredible stuff, including high-quality designs, a suite of four American Female short film book trailers with custom music production, a kick-ass launch party featuring craft beer from 4Hands Brewery, gourmet food from Burger 809, live art by Cherokee Street Reach artists, AF trailer screening and pop-up shop, AF art & print gallery, and NYC DJ Nebraska Jones flying in to spin all night.  


American Female Trailer Suite
The American Female Trailer Suite presents a visual and aural experience through the four main themes of the literature: tension, mysticism, adventure, and passion.



#1 TENSION
   

#2 MYSTICISM




#3 ADVENTURE

#4 PASSION





What I Need
I need $10,000. As an independent author, publisher, and marketer, I'm 100% financially responsible for the American Female book launch. I've been making it happen, but now I need your help.

Stretch Goal
Funding raised beyond the initial goal will be applied in the above areas as needed to ensure the success of the American Female book launch, specifically preparing for the creation of the American Female screenplay, and a few other awesome AF-related projects I've had on the back burner just because they didn't fit in the budget.

<div>
<p>As a former educator of young children in public schools, I loved making children laugh by embellishing the stories I read at story time.  I always added my own twists, personalities, and sometimes dialogues to the characters. I loved it when giggling children would say,  ""Hee-hee! Teacher, you're so funny!""  </p>
<p>My husband, (designer/illustrator), and I love animals and have always enjoyed watching the silly antics of our own pets.  Animals are truly like cartoons to us.  They make us laugh all the time.  </p>
<p>We want to share this joy with others, as well as, <i>inspire children to aspire to accomplishment,</i> as they learn morals and values through the mistakes and successes of our own little Pepe.</p>

<p>Here are reasons why we need you in our 'PEPE's DREAM' volume 1 funding campaign: time to create, professional art direction, layout, storyboard, design, illustration and production of a finished product with printing, packaging, shipping and distribution.</p>

</div></div>","The Story

Say hello to Pepe.  He is a penguin with a big heart and a dreamer with great aspirations who must overcome many obstacles in order to accomplish his impossible dream.  What is this dream of his?  It is to perform with the dolphins in the dolphin show.  Obstacle #1: Pepe is just a little penguin.  Penguins don't just perform with dolphins.  Then again, penguins don't talk either.  Yet, Pepe does.  In fact, he is bilingual. ""Say hello Pepe."" ""Hola!"" ... See I told you.How will he accomplish his dream?  In order to do this, he must learn many of life's lessons like having the willingness to work hard and watch his weight.  This is not always an easy task because for one thing, Pepe loves to eat!  Can you guess his favorite food?By following Pepe in his adventures, children will be entertained, encouraged, uplifted, and all the while, they will learn many of life's lessons -- much like the timeless stories of long ago that are still read and quoted to this day.  - J. D. Lauren
The Adventures of PEPE the Penguin                                                                'PEPE's  DREAM' -  Volume 1                                                                                            'PEPE the Penguin' dreams to be in the Dolphin show at Ocean Castle park.     J. D. Lauren - AuthorWhy Are We Doing It

As a former educator of young children in public schools, I loved making children laugh by embellishing the stories I read at story time.  I always added my own twists, personalities, and sometimes dialogues to the characters. I loved it when giggling children would say,  ""Hee-hee! Teacher, you're so funny!""  
My husband, (designer/illustrator), and I love animals and have always enjoyed watching the silly antics of our own pets.  Animals are truly like cartoons to us.  They make us laugh all the time.  
We want to share this joy with others, as well as, inspire children to aspire to accomplishment, as they learn morals and values through the mistakes and successes of our own little Pepe.



Who We Are                                                                                                            Educator and author, A. Lorraine Pacheco, MA (J.D. Lauren - nom de plume) and     Professional designer/illustrator, R. Phillip Pacheco. 


We are a husband and wife team with a passion for sharing with families the best in reading to their children and have fun along the way. Our mission is serious, and our method is imagination, visual learning, and practical application.""This is our dream.""

Why A Children's Picture Book?
We all treasured picture books when we were children. Many had a positive impact on the way we learned to understand the world today. 

Instead of making yet another penguin book or how to improve a child's learning to read, we want to captivate the visual imagination of young children and adults, so that they can recognize a positive and fun learning experience. 'PEPE the Penguin' will inspire, amaze and fascinate the visual imagination of reading. 



Pepe and FriendsPepe was sad, when a very wise old penguin said, ""You can do anything you set your mind to do, Pepe.""
FOCUS GROUP
As the story of PEPE was developed, early versions were shared with a few members of a creative writing group. Here is an excerpt of their response.
""I sent a copy of 'Pepe's Dream' to my son to read to my granddaughter; she loved it, and wanted the next story.""
...another member said.
""Sharks don't circle around prey like that!""… Instructor replied: ""But…you don't have any problem with all the animals talking?"" …

Why We Need You

Truly, an appealing storybook which children want to read also needs to have excellent illustration and design. The visual look and feel of the book are at least as important as the story. Richly detailed illustration will show, as well as, help tell the story. 
Here are reasons why we need you in our 'PEPE's DREAM' volume 1 funding campaign: time to create, professional art direction, layout, storyboard, design, illustration and production of a finished product with printing, packaging, shipping and distribution.

<p>Im Gegensatz zu ""normalen"" Skateboardmagazinen, beschäftigen wir uns mit den Gesichtern hinter der Kulisse, mit besonderen Projekten und gerne engagieren wir uns auch für Firmen oder Personen, die anderen helfen. News aus der Szene, Industrie und Stories aus der bunten Vergangenheit des Longboardens runden die dreimonatliche Publikation ab.<br/></p>
<p>Mit dem beginnenden Longboard-Trend ist auch das 40inch Longboardmagazin immer beliebter geworden. Um flächendeckend arbeiten zu können, benötigen wir Euren Support. Bis dato ist das Magazin nur in Fachgeschäften oder online erhältlich. Zumeist waren die Auflagen in den Shops schnell vergriffen. Ein Nachdruck war aus finanziellen Gründen nicht möglich.</p>
<p>Mit einem Invest von 19.500 Euro können wir unsere Auflage erhöhen und den Bahnhofsbuchhandel deutschlandweit bestücken und den Fachhandel besser bedienen. Da dies zunächst kostenintensiv ist, benötigen wir Eure Unterstützung. Warum wir flächendeckend arbeiten wollen?</p>
<p>Longboardfahren ist der am schnellesten wachsende Sport der letzten zwei Jahre. Es gibt keine bestätigten Zahlen, jedoch dürfte die Anzahl der verkauften Longboards in den letzten Jahren in Deutschland um die 400.000 Stück betragen. Genaue Zahlen hierzu gibt es nicht. Aber in die Richtung wird es wohl gehen Wir erhalten sehr oft Mails von Fans, die sich wünschen, das Magazin direkt bei sich im Ort kaufen zu können.<br/></p>
<p>Ein Magazin ist für eine Extremsportszene ein sehr wichtiges Medium. Ohne dieses verliert eine Szene seine Chronisten und damit den Status den sie verdient.</p>

Im Gegensatz zu ""normalen"" Skateboardmagazinen, beschäftigen wir uns mit den Gesichtern hinter der Kulisse, mit besonderen Projekten und gerne engagieren wir uns auch für Firmen oder Personen, die anderen helfen. News aus der Szene, Industrie und Stories aus der bunten Vergangenheit des Longboardens runden die dreimonatliche Publikation ab.
Mit dem beginnenden Longboard-Trend ist auch das 40inch Longboardmagazin immer beliebter geworden. Um flächendeckend arbeiten zu können, benötigen wir Euren Support. Bis dato ist das Magazin nur in Fachgeschäften oder online erhältlich. Zumeist waren die Auflagen in den Shops schnell vergriffen. Ein Nachdruck war aus finanziellen Gründen nicht möglich.
Mit einem Invest von 19.500 Euro können wir unsere Auflage erhöhen und den Bahnhofsbuchhandel deutschlandweit bestücken und den Fachhandel besser bedienen. Da dies zunächst kostenintensiv ist, benötigen wir Eure Unterstützung. Warum wir flächendeckend arbeiten wollen?
Longboardfahren ist der am schnellesten wachsende Sport der letzten zwei Jahre. Es gibt keine bestätigten Zahlen, jedoch dürfte die Anzahl der verkauften Longboards in den letzten Jahren in Deutschland um die 400.000 Stück betragen. Genaue Zahlen hierzu gibt es nicht. Aber in die Richtung wird es wohl gehen Wir erhalten sehr oft Mails von Fans, die sich wünschen, das Magazin direkt bei sich im Ort kaufen zu können.
Ein Magazin ist für eine Extremsportszene ein sehr wichtiges Medium. Ohne dieses verliert eine Szene seine Chronisten und damit den Status den sie verdient.
Das 40inch Magazin wird auch weiter erscheinen, wenn die Kampagne nicht zündet. Wenn auch wie bisher, nur in ausgewählten Shops oder eben online. Und weiterhin in sehr kleiner Auflage mit eben auch sehr beschränkten Möglichkeiten.
   Was du uns gibst & was du bekommst  Es werden in etwa 15.000 Euro für den Druck benötigt und ca. 4000 Euro für die Distribution. über die Pressedistribution + Versand.

Wenn das Founding Ziel nicht erreicht wird, werden wir die Ausgabe natürlich trotzdem herstellen, wie auch alle anderen Produkte. Jedoch in kleinerer Auflage. Dein Invest wird trotzdem mit den Pearks belohnt werden.

   
Die Folgen Was machen wir mit all dem Geld - und was wenn wir das Ziel nicht erreichen?  Hilfe! Wir wurden überfallen...

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a widely-published writer, poet (author of SPORES FROM SHARNOTH AND OTHER MADNESSES, P'rea Press, now in its 4th printing) and occultist. This chapbook combines all my interests - three stories of Sherlock Holmes set against backgrounds of occult and horrific menace.</p>
<p>My campaign is important to me because I am passionate about Sherlock Holmes, the greatest detective of all time. I loved writing these stories set in the Victorian area, and they have already garnered acclaim from their first in-print appearances.</p>
<p>If you fund my campaign you will be helping produce an entertaining chapbook that will delight all Holmes fans, with some dark overtones sure to delight horror readers too!</p>
<p>The project is FULLY AUTHORISED BY THE ESTATE OF SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need approximately $800 to fund the costs of printing a limited edition quantity of the chapbook. $200 and any excess above the funding campaign target will be reserved for sending out review and complimentary copies to some of the most influential people in the Holmes and horror worlds.</p>
<p>Unique perks of this campaign are as follows:</p>
<p>Contribute $25 and get a copy of the chapbook personally signed by author Leigh Blackmore.</p>
<p>Contribute $40 and get a copy personally signed by both Leigh Blackmore and the interior artist. </p>
<p>Contribute $50 and get a copy personally signed by both Leigh Blackmore and the interior artist, together with a paperback novel based on Holmes as a character (limit of 6 on this perk) of Leigh's choosing. </p>
<p>Contribute $75 and get a copy personally signed by both Leigh Blackmore and the interior artist, together with a rare out-of-print copy of Leigh Blackmore's horror magazine Terror Australis: The Australian Horror and Fantasy Magazine (limit of 2 on this perk)</p>
<p>If the campaign does not reach its goal, the funds realised will be held until the project can be realised next year (2017). All donors of 'perks' amounts will still receive their perk, during 2017 when the chapbook appears.</p>

<p>Here's what critics said about JUST ONE of the three stories to be collected in this chapbook:</p>
<p>“Exalted Are the Forces of Darkness”</p>

<p>-- Peter Tennant (UK),  <i>Black Static </i>No. 16.</p>
<p>“Brilliant…succeeded admirably in every way. You have my utmost respect for your authentic portrayal of the occult as a true believer. Your story rang with a note of truth that is rare to find in fiction. I shall always admire you for that accomplishment.”</p>

<h3>Starting the Journey</h3>
<p>Hi we are Mary and Ronald Crampton, authors of the forthcoming book, An Engraved Mark: A Journey to Find Character.</p>
<p>(Feel free to read book excerpt: <a href=""http://www.anoddbox.com/an%20engraved%20mark.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.anoddbox.com/an%20engraved%20mark.htm</a>)</p>
<p>Ronald is a Licensed Professional Counselor. Mary is a Business Systems Analyst. But these are just labels they have achieved throughout their lives. Ronald is a Marine--A war veteran who has seen the ugliest of what humans can do. Mary is a woman who was told, ""Women cannot do that."" Mary is a leader who achieves amazing loyalty through the genuineness of her unique way. However, she has often struggled with those who want her to command loyalty rather than reciprocate loyalty. Ronald is really good at the actual meaning of respect. He has an impressive talent in revealing the value within others. However, he struggles with the observation and realization that others do not actually value themselves. We decided to take a leap of faith and take a break from our careers to focus on writing about a topic we are both passionate about--Character.</p>
<p>This book starts with Ronald's personal journey through his lifetime in which he would find the values of character. It then moves into a journey section where in collaboration with Mary, we explain the characters and virtues and offer guidance to help you with your own personal journey.</p>
<p>For us, this is our work of a lifetime, something we believe we are meant to do. This is really more than a book for us, it is a launching point for a movement. We believe that building a world of great character, is done one unique person at a time.</p>
<p>Admittedly taking the break from our jobs is rather frightening. Life does not stop, regardless of our passion. From the cost of designing the cover to editing to printing, we take the hit. We decided to take on self-publishing because it was appearing that the industry wanted to take away our voice from the book. How could we ask you to be unique, if we abandon from the very start, what the book--the movement--is all about.</p>
<p>By helping us with the publishing of this book you are inspiring the message of being unique--Of being the engraved marks of who you are.</p>
<div><span style=""line-height: 30px;letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></div>
<p>It is shocking just how much it costs to publish a book. Approximately:</p>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li><span>$5000 goes toward editing.</span></li>
<li><span>$3000 for the design of cover and interior.</span></li>
<li><span>$5000 for printing of 1000 copies of softcover.</span></li>
<li><span>$7000 for printing of 500 copies of hardcover</span></li>
<li><span>$1250 (5%) to Indiegogo fee</span></li>
<li><span>$1250 (5%) to credit card fees</span></li>
<li><span>$2500 for materials, development, and fulfillment of perks.</span></li>
</ul>
<div>Perks include:</div>
<ul>
<li><span>$10 - Heartfelt recognition on our AnOddBox website.</span></li>
<li><span>$50 - You will receive one (1) signed softcover book.</span></li>
<li><span>$75 - You will receive one (1) signed hardcover book.</span></li>
<li><span>$100 - Perception Profile to personally engage in the book of An Engraved Mark plus you will receive one (1) signed softcover book.</span></li>
<li><span>$150 - Perception Profile to personally engage in the book of An Engraved Mark plus you will receive one (1) signed hardcover book.</span></li>
<li><span>$300 - Perception Profile plus one (1) individual session conducted via email or one (1) 55-minute office visit if within Denver metro area.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We believe this book has great purpose. If the amount of funds requested is not achieved all accumulated funds will still go toward publishing the book and all additional costs will be covered by us regardless.</p>
<div><h3>The Impact</h3></div>
<p>I have spent most of my life living the scripts others had written for me and feeling the scars of the labels branded on my own definition. It took nearly forty years for me to finally step one foot into my own life. It took an additional ten years to discover and define who I truly am--To define my engraved marks.</p>
<p>In my own journey, I observed that I was not unique in being bastardized into a life and a definition that was not my own. Nearly every person I have met thus far has not been able to accurately define who they are. For some, it is of no concern and they are content with the complacency of their lives. For others, the burden of feeling lost and without a place to belong was too great and they succumbed to the depression of conforming. A few, however, feel the same calling as I do. It is a calling to be something more. But to become something more, one must first become what the one actually is.</p>
<p>A few years ago, I created what I call Character Profiling. It is an assessment and workshop program to help individuals define their actual character and start controlling the direction of their own lives. The individuals who have engaged in Character Profiling stand more solid with pride. They have achieved more meaningful relationships, even if it meant first ending an incompatible relationship. They have strengthened family relationships, relationships with friends, and significantly improved working relationships. And most important, they have been able to define their own engraved marks.</p>
<p>Our hope with this book An Engraved Mark: A Journey to Find Character, is that for those of you who are like me--like us--and feel you are standing in the middle of a desert with three-hundred and sixty degrees of horizons that all look the same, this book will help you take your first step in the direction of who you are.</p>
<p>With your help, as Mary has said, <span>“We can build a world of great character </span><span>one person at a time.”</span></p>
<div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3></div>
<p>We have already faced obstacles in the writing of this book, as it is not common--We are not common. We have been lambasted quite a bit because we do not follow the standard rules. The book is about embracing being an outlier and being proud of standing outside the norm. We have been adamantly instructed to follow the standard rules, but this would go against the core of the movement. We have to do this honorably. AND we refuse to give up our voice.</p>
<p>We quit our jobs because we believe in this cause. However, this means that we have been paying for everything out of our savings. If we cannot reach the goal to help us publish this book, we will still do it even if it means we have to start all over to rebuild ourselves. Like we stated, we are in this 100%.</p>
<div><span style=""line-height: 30px;letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></div>
<p>If you are unable to help us monetarily right now, there are other ways you can help. Please forward this campaign to others you know to help get the word out and spark interest. Apparently, Indiegogo has some good share tools and with other social medias, you might even start a global crusade.</p>
<p>By all means, let us know what you can do. AND thank you for doing so.</p>

Ronald is a Licensed Professional Counselor. Mary is a Business Systems Analyst. But these are just labels they have achieved throughout their lives. Ronald is a Marine--A war veteran who has seen the ugliest of what humans can do. Mary is a woman who was told, ""Women cannot do that."" Mary is a leader who achieves amazing loyalty through the genuineness of her unique way. However, she has often struggled with those who want her to command loyalty rather than reciprocate loyalty. Ronald is really good at the actual meaning of respect. He has an impressive talent in revealing the value within others. However, he struggles with the observation and realization that others do not actually value themselves. We decided to take a leap of faith and take a break from our careers to focus on writing about a topic we are both passionate about--Character.
This book starts with Ronald's personal journey through his lifetime in which he would find the values of character. It then moves into a journey section where in collaboration with Mary, we explain the characters and virtues and offer guidance to help you with your own personal journey.
For us, this is our work of a lifetime, something we believe we are meant to do. This is really more than a book for us, it is a launching point for a movement. We believe that building a world of great character, is done one unique person at a time.
Admittedly taking the break from our jobs is rather frightening. Life does not stop, regardless of our passion. From the cost of designing the cover to editing to printing, we take the hit. We decided to take on self-publishing because it was appearing that the industry wanted to take away our voice from the book. How could we ask you to be unique, if we abandon from the very start, what the book--the movement--is all about.
By helping us with the publishing of this book you are inspiring the message of being unique--Of being the engraved marks of who you are.
What We Need & What You Get
It is shocking just how much it costs to publish a book. Approximately:


$5000 goes toward editing.
$3000 for the design of cover and interior.
$5000 for printing of 1000 copies of softcover.
$7000 for printing of 500 copies of hardcover
$1250 (5%) to Indiegogo fee
$1250 (5%) to credit card fees
$2500 for materials, development, and fulfillment of perks.

Perks include:

$10 - Heartfelt recognition on our AnOddBox website.
$50 - You will receive one (1) signed softcover book.
$75 - You will receive one (1) signed hardcover book.
$100 - Perception Profile to personally engage in the book of An Engraved Mark plus you will receive one (1) signed softcover book.
$150 - Perception Profile to personally engage in the book of An Engraved Mark plus you will receive one (1) signed hardcover book.
$300 - Perception Profile plus one (1) individual session conducted via email or one (1) 55-minute office visit if within Denver metro area.

We believe this book has great purpose. If the amount of funds requested is not achieved all accumulated funds will still go toward publishing the book and all additional costs will be covered by us regardless.
The Impact
I have spent most of my life living the scripts others had written for me and feeling the scars of the labels branded on my own definition. It took nearly forty years for me to finally step one foot into my own life. It took an additional ten years to discover and define who I truly am--To define my engraved marks.
In my own journey, I observed that I was not unique in being bastardized into a life and a definition that was not my own. Nearly every person I have met thus far has not been able to accurately define who they are. For some, it is of no concern and they are content with the complacency of their lives. For others, the burden of feeling lost and without a place to belong was too great and they succumbed to the depression of conforming. A few, however, feel the same calling as I do. It is a calling to be something more. But to become something more, one must first become what the one actually is.
A few years ago, I created what I call Character Profiling. It is an assessment and workshop program to help individuals define their actual character and start controlling the direction of their own lives. The individuals who have engaged in Character Profiling stand more solid with pride. They have achieved more meaningful relationships, even if it meant first ending an incompatible relationship. They have strengthened family relationships, relationships with friends, and significantly improved working relationships. And most important, they have been able to define their own engraved marks.
Our hope with this book An Engraved Mark: A Journey to Find Character, is that for those of you who are like me--like us--and feel you are standing in the middle of a desert with three-hundred and sixty degrees of horizons that all look the same, this book will help you take your first step in the direction of who you are.
With your help, as Mary has said, “We can build a world of great character one person at a time.”
Risks & Challenges
We have already faced obstacles in the writing of this book, as it is not common--We are not common. We have been lambasted quite a bit because we do not follow the standard rules. The book is about embracing being an outlier and being proud of standing outside the norm. We have been adamantly instructed to follow the standard rules, but this would go against the core of the movement. We have to do this honorably. AND we refuse to give up our voice.
We quit our jobs because we believe in this cause. However, this means that we have been paying for everything out of our savings. If we cannot reach the goal to help us publish this book, we will still do it even if it means we have to start all over to rebuild ourselves. Like we stated, we are in this 100%.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you are unable to help us monetarily right now, there are other ways you can help. Please forward this campaign to others you know to help get the word out and spark interest. Apparently, Indiegogo has some good share tools and with other social medias, you might even start a global crusade.
By all means, let us know what you can do. AND thank you for doing so.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My involvement in the AIDS community began in the late '80s as a fundraiser in Chicago. I worked with several AIDS service organizations planning events and writing grant proposals, on staff and as a consultant. The picture you see here is of me with my assistant, Steve Showalter, at one of our events in 1990. He died a couple years later. By 1994, now married with a new baby, I burned out. I kept up on new treatment developments and marked World AIDS Day, but that was it. </p>
<p>In 2011, publisher Tracy Baim asked me contribute to <i>Windy City Times'</i>  ""AIDS@30"" series. I wasn't sure I would remember anything, but I was wrong. I sat down at the computer and the keyboard fairly smoked. It wasn't just that I was typing fast: it was a long-repressed anger at what I'd seen and experienced. Memories rushed back and overwhelmed me at times, even as I wrote a book, <strong><a href=""http://www.victorianoe.com/books/friend-grief-and-aids/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Friend Grief and AIDS: Thirty Years of Burying Our Friends</i></a></strong>. I was back in the community, joining ACT UP/NY, now as a writer and activist. </p>
<p>But it was a panel discussion - ""The Women of ACT UP/NY: Fight Back! Fight AIDS!"" - held at the New York Public Library in April, 2014 that gave me the idea for this book. The auditorium was full, and though I was familiar with a lot of what they discussed, my college-student daughter and many in the audience were not. The thought that popped into my head that night, the thought that I couldn't dismiss, was ""These stories need to be told.""</p>
<p><strong>Let's Be Honest: Does the World Really Need Another Book about AIDS?</strong></p>
<p>I asked myself the same question. I checked the literature of the epidemic, sure that straight women had been included. But as important as many of those books are, they tend to be written by and reflect the experiences of gay men. Even books about women's history give little or no notice to an epidemic that has raged for thirty-five years: an epidemic that has affected straight women from the beginning and disproportionately affects women of color.</p>
<p>This book, then, is different. It fills a gap not only in the history of the AIDS epidemic, but in women's history as well. It honors the contributions of straight women around the world who often rushed in when others ran away.</p>
<p><strong>Which brings us to the next question: Why me?</strong></p>
<p>Between 2013 and 2016, I published a <a href=""http://www.victorianoe.com/buy-books/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">series</a> of six small books about people grieving their friends. That series prepared me to write a much larger, more challenging book. My involvement in the AIDS community has earned me the respect of my peers, many of whom have already assisted in the research. And the book itself - the focus on the contributions of women who have largely gone unrecognized - has generated great interest from men and women alike.</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you'll be part of something that is new, different, important and eagerly anticipated. How do I know that? A leading AIDS publication asked a few months ago when they can print an excerpt. Two bookstores have committed to book launch parties. Reviewers and magazine publishers have asked for the opportunity to help promote it. Organizations from San Francisco to New York, as well as London, are helping with the research.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The campaign goal is $1,500. That will pay a large chunk of travel expenses for my January trip to the East Coast. I'll be interviewing women in Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC and Atlanta. Meeting my goal will cover travel to and from Chicago and between cities, local travel and most of my housing costs, including meals. I'm a pretty efficient traveler. If I don't meet the goal, the money still goes towards that trip.</p>
<p><strong>But you really want to know what you get for your donation, don't you?</strong></p>
<p>One of my favorite organizations is <a href=""https://broadwaycares.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Broadway Cares/Equity FIghts AIDS</a>. As a former fundraiser I'm in awe of their success (and yes, you'll meet women from there in the book, including one of the founders, Colleen Dewhurst). In fact, sales of my earlier book about losing friends to AIDS benefit BC/EFA.</p>
<p>Many of your perks come from their store. The ones listed here are the start: more will be added later in the campaign, so you'll want to check back every Monday to find out what's new. The first group of perks, depending on the level of support include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shout-out on social media and in my weekly newsletter to thank you for your support.</li>
<li>Recognition in the book itself.</li>
<li>Email newsletter with updates and news for supporters (twice a month)</li>
<li>The e-book of <i><strong>Fag Hags, Divas and Moms.</strong></i>
</li>
<li>A signed print copy of <i><strong>Fag Hags, Divas and Moms.</strong></i>
</li>
<li>A special invitation to the book's launch party in New York or Chicago.</li>
</ul>
<p>And from Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS:</p>
<ul>
<li>A hard-cover journal and pen</li>
<li>2017 Broadway Bares calendar</li>
<li>Carols for a Cure, Volume 18,  2-cd set</li>
<li>And more, coming weekly during the campaign</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When I started work on this book last fall, I was wasn't sure if anyone else thought it was interesting, much less important.</p>
<p>Within minutes of posting a request for leads on Facebook, I began receiving messages from people in the US and UK with names and contact information for women to interview. And they all said, ""Thank you for doing this."" When most people think of the AIDS epidemic and who it impacted, they think of white, gay men. Women - whether HIV-positive or negative, volunteer or staff, family member or friend - are rarely considered. </p>
<p>There will certainly be recognizable names in the book: Elizabeth Taylor and Princess Diana, for example. But most of the women in it are the ones who gave of themselves without public recognition. They deserve to have their contributions honored. It's time.</p>
<p>Last year, I won the Christopher Hewitt Award for Creative Nonfiction from <i>A&amp;U Magazine</i> for an AIDS-related essay, <a href=""http://www.aumag.org/2015/10/13/long-term-survivor/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Long-Term Survivor""</a>. Until I wrote that, I did not consider myself a member of that club. I'm HIV-negative, so I assumed I was excluded. But I was wrong, because as Jeff Berry from TPAN (Test Positive Aware Network) insisted: ""You were there."" Yes, I was, in those dark, frightening, angry early days of the epidemic. And so were a lot of other straight women who you will meet in the pages of this book.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>At this point the biggest challenge is the timeline. I've set World AIDS Day 2017 as my publication date. And yes, that's pretty aggressive. I wouldn't feel comfortable with it if I hadn't already done quite a bit of research. </p>
<p>Although there are several agents interested in the book, I am proceeding on the assumption that I'm self-publishing, as I've successfully done with my other books. </p>
<p>However, no plan is perfect. If there is any delay, that would make publication March 1, 2018, the beginning of Women's History Month. It seems like a long way's off, but it's really not (that's why there are perks for now and perks for later). </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Money's not everything, nor is it the only thing. And this book is simply not possible without the contributions of men and women around the world who are just as passionate about bringing these stories to life as I am.</p>
<p>Here are some important ways you can help whether you donate to the campaign or not:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're a straight woman who has been involved in the AIDS community at any time in the epidemic, share your story with me.</li>
<li>You can 'like' the Facebook <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/FagHagsDivasandMoms/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">page</a> dedicated to the book. </li>

<li>Let your friends and family know about this project by using the Indiegogo share tools.</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Kurzbeschreibung Wir helfen Geflüchteten - direkt und unbürokratisch. Dort, wo unsere Hilfe am dringendsten benötigt wird!
Nach unserer ersten erfolgreichen Fahrt an die Slowenisch-Kroatische Grenze (Brežice und Dobova) vom 27. - 29.10.2015 waren wir überwältigt. Von den kriegsähnlichen Zuständen vor Ort, aber auch davon, was wir mit unserer Hilfe bewirken konnten.


Wir haben nicht nur Nahrungsmittel an Menschen verteilt, die teilweise seit Tagen nichts mehr gegessen haben, sondern auch einen ganzen Transporter voll Kleidung, Schuhen, Decken und vielen anderen Dingen, die dringend benötigt wurden.Deshalb planen wir bereits die nächste Fahrt für den 12.11.2015, wieder mit einem randvollen Transporter (oder zwei, wenn es die Mittel zulassen) und mindestens drei Freiwilligen Helfern.
Sachspenden wie Kleidung, Schuhe und einigen Hygieneartikeln erhalten wir von mehreren Freiwilligen-Lagern in München (u. A. von Andreas Einbeck und dem Lager in der Schwere-Reiter-Str.).
Folgende Dinge müssen aber leider zugekauft werden/kosten Geld und dafür brauchen wir EURE UNTERSTÜTZUNG:  Decken und Regencapes
 Hygiene-Artikel
 Nahrungsmittel und Wasser

Miete für Transporter, Treibstoff und Mauten
  Bitte helft uns, die Situation vor Ort an den ständig wechselnden Brennpunkten maßgeblich zu verbessern!

<p><strong>It's time for JAMM... issue #3 !!!</strong></p>
<p>Just A Minor Malfunction... is an independent science-fiction e-zine, dedicated to publishing quality, thought-provoking, professionally-edited sci-fi.  We take submissions, and no story will receive a form letter rejection.</p>
<p>After the launch of JAMM... issue #1 ( <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G223BWS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G223BWS</a> ) and issue #2 ( <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NA9QR"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01NA9QRAY</a> ) with stories from 12 independent authors, it's time for issue #3!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the Editor</strong></p>
<p>My name is Michael S. Alter, and I am a life-long sci-fi fan.  I grew up reading Asimov's and Analog, Heinlein and Clarke.  I love the stories, although editing errors would always throw me.</p>
<p>A few years back I started writing my own stories, and earlier this year I decided to try my hand at publishing.  I launched issue #1 with several key ideas in mind:</p>
<p>No form letters to authors submitting a story.  I'll always give you at least some personalized feedback.</p>
<p>Sharing the profits with the authors.  All authors receive a share of the proceeds according to a formula.</p>
<p>Authors retain the rights to their work, even after my edits.  I only keep the right to continue publishing the story as part of the issue of the magazine.</p>
<p>Low-priced, high-quality stories, about a dozen or so per issue.  I'm a strong editor, I'll work with my authors to put out only the best stories.  I have additional reviewers/editors keeping me honest, too.  (Thanks again to Louise Sorensen and Mel McElveen!)</p>
<p>I'm not trying to make big money out of this, only enough to take my wife out for a nice dinner! ;-)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What you get</strong></p>
<p>Sci-fi!  It'll make you think, and maybe open your eyes a little to the future coming at us.  There'll be about a dozen sci-fi stories (maybe 30,000 to 50,000 words total), plus an article from the editor (that's me!) about the future in the real world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>No risks at all.  I'm receiving a number of good stories, and I have a half-dozen of my own stories ready to publish, though I only expect to put one of my own in issue #3.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Submitting a Story</strong></p>
<p>If you'd like to submit a story, send it (as text in the body of the email, please!) to:</p>

<p>Rules for submission:</p>
<p>4,000 words of less (I'm not super-strict about that one)</p>
<p>PG-13 or tamer (a bit more strict on that account, but there is a gray area)</p>
<p>Has to be a work where you own all the rights</p>
<p>Science fiction, or maybe tales of the weird.  No swords and sorcery, please!</p>

<h3>We believe that compelling, diverse farm journalism is needed now more than ever. We need your help!</h3>
<p>Crop Stories is a biannual print publication that digs deep into relationships between farmer and field, consumer and market, soil and table. We launched in Athens, Georgia in 2014, and created three editions — blueberries, winter squash, and radishes — that employed narrative, history, and recipe to explore agriculture in the South.</p>
<p>It soon became evident that Crop Stories filled an untapped need for readers interested in our blend of agricultural food stories, photography, culinary coverage, and food advocacy. Crop Stories garnered regional and national attention from well-respected food platforms such as <a href=""https://www.tastingtable.com/cook/national/crop-stories-food-magazine-radish-recipes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tasting Table</a>, Paste Magazine, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and the Charleston Post and Courier.</p>
<p>Launched as a labor of love by farmers and writers, Crop Stories' editorial team assessed its plan for the future and decided they wanted more. A bigger, better publication. To do so, we need help.</p>
<p>Our vision is to create a beautiful, tactile magazine experience that honors the great agricultural traditions and future of the American South, doing so with journalistic integrity, an artistic eye, and compelling stories told by diverse voices. Planned stories include a gritty travelogue from the Sweet Potato Capital of the World, narratives from past and present poultry plant workers, an agrarian guide to Alabama, an illustrated homage to George Washington Carver, and a personal journey exploring an African American family's connection to farmland in North Florida.</p>
<p>We aim to introduce our revamped Crop Stories in the fall of 2017.</p>
<p>To accomplish all this, we seek partners who share in our vision – organizations and individuals who believe in the power of the soil and the power of story. Your financial support will bolster our efforts to produce a visually compelling zine and share it with a wider audience. Supporting our mission will help Crop Stories grow and support a talented staff and its crew of freelance writers, illustrators, and photographers.</p>
<p>In total, we need $11,000. This amount will fund production, hire a designer, pay our freelancers a fair rate, and afford the editorial team a modest promotional budget. </p>

<p>This book will hopefully stimulate you to change the way you think about your existence and the current status quo of day to day life. I hope it will set you on the path to true freedom, to be the person that you really want to be. I hope it will enlighten you as to the underlying rules that underpin our earthly flesh and blood existence. That being said, it's stated that when you understand the rules of the game, you can ALWAYS win the game. I hope It will improve your relationships with family, friends and colleagues, having opened up in you the ability to better relate to people on a deeper and more unconditional level. </p>
<p>When people have read the book my hope is that the new personal truths that they unearth and develop will influence world consciousness more dramatically in the following ways:</p> <ul> <li>Greater tolerance, forgiveness and unconditional love towards all living beings</li>
<li>Acceptance of the role of all humanity in protecting our environment</li>

My book has been a 20 year journey and I need your help to take it from pen-strokes and ideas, to a fully fledged book that you can take with you and enjoy the ride as you uncover the answers to Who's The King? If you support me, I will spend the money on:  Working with a professional editor.  Organising the artwork. Contracting a printer/publisher to ensure that you receive your book before Christmas this year.    
What You Get
 
This book will hopefully stimulate you to change the way you think about your existence and the current status quo of day to day life. I hope it will set you on the path to true freedom, to be the person that you really want to be. I hope it will enlighten you as to the underlying rules that underpin our earthly flesh and blood existence.

I hope It will improve your relationships with family, friends and colleagues, having opened up in you the ability to better relate to people on a deeper and more unconditional level. 
When people have read the book my hope is that the new personal truths that they unearth and develop will influence world consciousness more dramatically in the following ways:  Greater tolerance, forgiveness and unconditional love towards all living beings
Acceptance of the role of all humanity in protecting our environment
An understanding that each of us, individually and collectively, has the power to change the world for the better and that we must act NOW before nature and the universe step in and take charge.
   
Risks & Challenges 
 My plan is to deliver the finished book before Christmas this year. I have already written the material, but perhaps when I use a professional editor, it may take more time than expected.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jeanette Holt.  I've been writing for a few years but just recently, I became a full time carer to my husband who has early onset dementia and I had to give up my career as a maths teacher. So now I get to write.  A lot.</p>
<p>It is more important to me now to get my work published and that's what I hope to achieve with this campaign.</p>
<p>With your help I can give this completed and edited novel a professional polish and all the marketing it deserves.  It is an original story with an important message about the families of those whose loved ones are missing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need £3,000.  This will cover all the costs for final proof reading, publishing in hard copy and marketing.  Any extra money which I raise will do the same for my next novel.  Every penny is for my writing.</p>
<p>Remember, my perks include copies of all three of my books, not just this one.  So, lots of reading material plus, of course, my profound thanks.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm very proud of this book.  It holds a different and important perspective on the tragedies experienced by those whose loved ones are missing.  We see dramatic shots of grieving families on news reports but there is a deeper story.  A story I want to release to the world.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The book is already written and edited but without sufficient funding it won't make it further than an ebook.</p>

<p>CONFIRMED PARTICIPATING AUTHORS: Jane Yolen, Brenda Cooper, Irene Radford, Marie Brennan, Seanan McGuire,  Aliette de Bodard, Jacey Bedford, Joyce Reynolds-Ward, and more - FOUR DAYS LEFT to support this project and get new stories from all these wonderful writers!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello, my name is Alma Alexander… and I am one of the unmoored.</p>
<p>I have been lucky enough in my lifetime not to have been one of those truly adrift – I have never been forced out of a home, or a country, or made to go to strange places I could not understand, against my wishes, terrified and frozen. But I left the country of my birth aged 10, never to return there permanently to try and re-connect the severed roots. This does not mean I ceased to love it – this is the ground where the bones of my ancestors are buried, where their ghosts walk yet if such things can be; this is the place where the river I love so much runs eternally between shores of mud and thistle and weeping willow, the place where a sliver of my spirit lives still, lives always. And I understand, on that visceral level, what it means to be FORCED to leave a place one calls home.</p>
<p>I feel for the children whose early – whose *only* – memories involve bombs and fire and fury and guns and bullets and dust and blood and loss and grief. I feel for the emptiness I see blossoming behind their eyes, underneath the pain, the inability to understand why such things can be. I understand the way an older child might feel when torn apart from those first precious friendships with one’s peers, from the security and warmth of a family home; when witnessing the carnage of a hot war blowing up around them, none of their doing, something that they can do absolutely nothing about and that is completely capable of destroying everything they have ever believed to be true, like a dragon breathing a plume of flame on their lives and leaving ashes behind.</p>
<p>I watch these driven people who have lost everything climb on overladen boats which sink under the weight of frightened women and children and the few men who are trying to save them. I can see pictures daily of the hungry, of the abandoned, of the families torn apart, of children sitting catatonic with pain and loss under streaks and smears of blood and dirt. I can see it all on the news, on social media, in headlines, across the world, every day.</p>
<p>And I wonder what I can do. What I, and those like me, can do.</p>
<p>We can tell stories. Not THEIR stories – those are theirs to tell, some day, maybe. But stories like theirs. Stories which will reach out and tell other people about the truth of their lives, through the “lies” of fiction, of fantasy. We can shine a light, we who create art, into the dark places of this world. That is what we are for. That is what we do. That is what the best of us do, anyway. What we want to do. What we NEED to do.</p>
<p>This project is a collection of stories. Some by names you might recognize quickly; others, from writers who might have a more intimate, more visceral, connection with the subject matter, and of whom you might not have heard (yet). We are here to tell the stories. And when you choose to help us do this, with this book, with the collection of stories by the “Children of a Different Sky”, you join us to learn, and to share, and to grieve, and to make sure that the least and the most bitterly lost amongst us are not – are NEVER – forgotten.</p>
<p>Back in the land I come from, there is a beloved poet called Aleksa Santic, and a beloved and well known poem entitled, “Ostajte ovdje” – “Stay Here”. Young children of my heritage and culture know these lines – they are engraved on the souls of the humans of my nation. They are these:</p>
<p>Ostajte ovdje – sunce tudjeg neba</p>
<p>Nece vas grijat k’o sto ovo grije.</p>
<p>Gorki su tamo zalogaji hljeba</p>
<p>Gde svoga nema i gde brata nije.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Loosely translated,  with poetic licence, they read:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stay here – the sun of a foreign sky</p>
<p>Will never warm you like this one in your own heaven</p>
<p>Bitter is the bread in that place</p>
<p>Where you you’re among strangers and not amongst your brothers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We who were born under that sun, understand. There is no place like home, after all.</p>
<p>Like I said, I was never amongst those forced to leave such a place, which they knew, which they loved, where they belonged. But I left, nevertheless. And the poet is at least halfway right in that I never really feel more myself then when I (rarely, now) return to stand on the shores of the river which flows past the city of my birth. I, too, in a distant and rather more comfortable sense than some are today, am a refugee.</p>
<p>    </p>
<p>And this book, this collection, this effort to gather the stories and to make sure that they are not forgotten, this is my attempt to help save both the souls and the bodies of those who now need us most.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the money raised by this crowdfunding project will be passed on to several agencies who work with and offer aid to the refugees of our era. They used to be Jewish children running from the German Reich; today, they might be Syrian kids running from the ruins of Aleppo or Yazidi women fleeing enslavement in the darkness of cultural recidivism; Tomorrow, they might be ourselves.</p>
<p>We are all one. And there, where one of us stumbles over rubble, bloodied and in pain, having lost everything… there, but for the grace of God, goes any of us.</p>
<p>If you marched in a pussy hat in any city in the world where like-minded people gathered together… if you had the courage and the fury to follow your passion  by being one of the thousands who streamed to America’s airports after Donald Trump’s heavy-handed sledgehammer blow of the refugee/immigrant travel ban in the last days of January 2017… if you spent your precious time on the phone to your representatives decrying the injustices of the new era… I salute you, and I love you all, very much. If for whatever reason you could not march or raise your voices in the “No Fear/NoHate” cries at the airport or your voice strangles in your throat if you have to speak on the phone to a stranger… there are always ways to make your stand. Supporting this crowdfund – buying this book – throws your support both towards the writers and artists and other publishing professionals who made this happen, and in the days of defunding the arts that also is a statement of defiance, and makes certain that you have been a part in funneling much needed funds to organizations which work directly with the lost and the dispossessed. You helped. You can sit right there at your computer, right now, and click the “No Fear/No Hate” button. Help us help those who need us most in this moment.</p>

Hello, my name is Alma Alexander… and I am one of the unmoored.
I have been lucky enough in my lifetime not to have been one of those truly adrift – I have never been forced out of a home, or a country, or made to go to strange places I could not understand, against my wishes, terrified and frozen. But I left the country of my birth aged 10, never to return there permanently to try and re-connect the severed roots.

And I understand, on that visceral level, what it means to be FORCED to leave a place one calls home.
I feel for the children whose early – whose *only* – memories involve bombs and fire and fury and guns and bullets and dust and blood and loss and grief. I feel for the emptiness I see blossoming behind their eyes, underneath the pain, the inability to understand why such things can be.

Back in the land I come from, there is a beloved poet called Aleksa Santic, and a beloved and well known poem entitled, “Ostajte ovdje” – “Stay Here”. Young children of my heritage and culture know these lines – they are engraved on the souls of the humans of my nation. They are these:
Ostajte ovdje – sunce tudjeg neba
Nece vas grijat k’o sto ovo grije.
Gorki su tamo zalogaji hljeba
Gde svoga nema i gde brata nije.
 
Loosely translated,  with poetic licence, they read:
 
Stay here – the sun of a foreign sky
Will never warm you like this one in your own heaven
Bitter is the bread in that place
Where you you’re among strangers and not amongst your brothers.
 
We who were born under that sun, understand. There is no place like home, after all.
Like I said, I was never amongst those forced to leave such a place, which they knew, which they loved, where they belonged. But I left, nevertheless. And the poet is at least halfway right in that I never really feel more myself then when I (rarely, now) return to stand on the shores of the river which flows past the city of my birth. I, too, in a distant and rather more comfortable sense than some are today, am a refugee.
    
And this book, this collection, this effort to gather the stories and to make sure that they are not forgotten, this is my attempt to help save both the souls and the bodies of those who now need us most.
The vast majority of the money raised by this crowdfunding project will be passed on to several agencies who work with and offer aid to the refugees of our era. They used to be Jewish children running from the German Reich; today, they might be Syrian kids running from the ruins of Aleppo or Yazidi women fleeing enslavement in the darkness of cultural recidivism; Tomorrow, they might be ourselves.
We are all one. And there, where one of us stumbles over rubble, bloodied and in pain, having lost everything… there, but for the grace of God, goes any of us.
If you marched in a pussy hat in any city in the world where like-minded people gathered together… if you had the courage and the fury to follow your passion  by being one of the thousands who streamed to America’s airports after Donald Trump’s heavy-handed sledgehammer blow of the refugee/immigrant travel ban in the last days of January 2017… if you spent your precious time on the phone to your representatives decrying the injustices of the new era… I salute you, and I love you all, very much. If for whatever reason you could not march or raise your voices in the “No Fear/NoHate” cries at the airport or your voice strangles in your throat if you have to speak on the phone to a stranger… there are always ways to make your stand. Supporting this crowdfund – buying this book – throws your support both towards the writers and artists and other publishing professionals who made this happen, and in the days of defunding the arts that also is a statement of defiance, and makes certain that you have been a part in funneling much needed funds to organizations which work directly with the lost and the dispossessed. You helped. You can sit right there at your computer, right now, and click the “No Fear/No Hate” button. Help us help those who need us most in this moment.
 
Pass the word about this. Share with people you know who might be willing to come on board.

<p>You will receive an unparalleled entertainment experience in the form of the best dramatic audiobook we are able to produce. Not only will it have voice acting, but it will have sounds and an original musical score from Jared Cowing and Keith W's band. We also have some fantastic rewards for going above and beyond in this endeavor.

pain to death in a nanosecond. I couldn’t think straight. The next thing I knew, I was being

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I boldly told my doctor (with more than a bit of false

all go away. The nurse in me wanted the surgery so that I could hedge my bets and
also it to prove to myself (and the doctors) that I was already healed. The <i>woo woo</i> part of me pulled out all the stops to fulfill my intention
for complete wellness. Much to everyone’s surprise, indeed shock, the surgery
revealed that the huge tumor wrapped around my right ovary was no longer cancerous and all of the twenty or so biopsied

Holy Crap! Those are three little words no one ever wants to hear. They will change
your life forever. They sure changed mine. For me, it was ovarian cancer and the
prognosis was not great.  My thoughts went from cancer to fear to
pain to death in a nanosecond. I couldn’t think straight. The next thing I knew, I was being
set up for more scans…more blood work and scheduled for surgery. My
life had been taken over by strangers. I felt overwhelmed and out of control. I needed some time to think but, really, who could think? Nothing in my forty years as a nurse ever prepared me for being on the
receiving end of this kind of news. I knew that I needed to get a jump on the
fear so that I could be a full participant in my own healing. After all, it was my body. I was able to deal with the fear pretty
quickly with a lot of support. That gave me a little breathing room.  As much as I wanted the cancer out of my body
right now, I learned that a cancer
diagnosis is not an emergency and it is not a death sentence. It was essential
for me to step back, get on top of the fear allowing me to make some rational decisions
after exploring all of my treatment
options before I committed to anything.

I had long ago integrated a mind-body-spirit approach to the
patients in my care and found I had to do the same thing for myself. I believe
deeply that the body has an amazing ability to self-heal. A cut on the finger
heals in days with little more than a Band-Aid. We can get over a cold with

Amazon gift cards would help as well, as I need to read as many books about street art as I can. iTunes gift certificates would be great as well as there's some photography-related  software I need to buy.
I'm excited to share this adventure with everyone, particularly the folks who have taken my tours in the past!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>most of the time, they get a press release.</p>

<h3>why the need for unbargo?</h3>

unbargo makes the world a better place as it provides a 
borderless service
for any newsmaker anywhere to post their news for anyone to read. the
one and only purpose of any press release is to reach the reader. but, newsmakers 
usually need to persuade reporters first. even if reporters are convinced, they 
still need to find an angle to win their editors over.
and if their editors agree, those press releases need to be re-written 
and edited, before they're published much later, days or sometimes months after they were
 received. in our perhaps-idealistic
viewpoint, news should be reported because of newsworthiness, not because of
better contacts or finances. by providing a free service for 
newsmakers to get news out directly to 
readers, we're leveling the playing field for businesses of all sizes. 
plus, we made it much, much simpler with unbargo. just send your press 
release to news@unbargo.com 
and it will be auto-extracted, ready to reach readers, unedited and 
uncensored.<br/>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>who is behind unbargo?</h3>
<p>our international team comprises former-and-current news folks in both old
 and new media – from print newspapers and magazines to online news, tv and radio – including a former editor-in-chief of two major rival 
national newspapers (not at the same time of course). thus, we've the 
edge as we already have unfettered access to press releases worldwide.</p>
<h3>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>how does unbargo get its press releases?</h3>
<p>besides
 us already having access to tons of press releases daily, tens of thousands 
more will be sent to unbargo every day by newsmakers direct, and 
pr agencies on behalf of their clients. all these press releases will be auto-converted to web format and instantly uploaded so news 
gets out asap – which is what newsmakers need and what readers want. all press releases are
presented under 20 separate categories, spanning <i>hard</i> and <i>soft</i> news, from business to beauty and tech to travel.</p>

<h3>what's the difference between unbargo and existing wire agencies?</h3></span><p>wire agencies
are for the press, unbargo is for readers. wire agencies aim to persuade the press to feature news so as to reach readers, but while this may have been
necessary in the past when going through the press was the only way, the
internet changed all that. unbargo is focused on creating a reader-centric,
reader-friendly service, one that delivers news straight from the source
(newsmakers) direct to readers.<span style=""color: rgb(15, 33, 5); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Liberation Sans', FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: normal;""> </span></p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>name 3 highlights of unbargo?</h3></span>
<p><b>1. it's familiar</b><br/>unbargo looks the same on mobile or desktop, and on different OS or browsers, because we insist
on similarity. you'll always know
the functions you're already used to seeing instead of re-exploring where each is on the different platforms and how each works all over
again (try spotting the differences of facebook on mobilephone and tablet
below). unbargo's font size even cleverly adjusts to accommodate the viewing
distance and screen size of specific gadgets.<span style=""color: rgb(15, 33, 5); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, 'Liberation Sans', FreeSans, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px; font-weight: normal;""></span></p>

<p><b>2. it's smart</b><br/>unbargo is
designed to learn from you. whenever you search, it gets better at giving you
the most relevant news right at the top, so you get what you're looking for
faster each time. and every time you click ""x"" on search results that
aren't what you want, not only will those results be removed from (just) your
view, making it easier for you to focus, unbargo will also learn how to better
spot what you want in future.</p>

<p><b>3. it remembers</b><br/>unbargo
provides a <i>history</i> <i>page</i>
(see below), for you to re-access everything instead of
wracking your brain remembering what you read before. you can remove anything
from this page easily by clicking the delete button. history also contains
keywords you used during specific searches so you can fine-tune your results. readers who wish to can keep searches anonymous simply by not logging in.</p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>what does unbargo need funding for?</h3></span><p>so far we've paid for unbargo's development out of personal conviction, but to make it the world-changing revolution it can be, we need help funding the crucial extras. we'll have to store millions of press releases around the world annually, as well as
the mountains of hi-res photos that come with them – and storage is costly even
with cloud hosting (good thing there's <i>youtube</i> so we don't need to store videos too!). also, we're working hard to make our search engine capable of giving
you relevant results instantly, so it's literally available to you the second it's sent to
reporters. at the same time, we're negotiating with third parties to bring past press releases to
you, to create the most complete database in the world. in the works as well is analytics for newsmakers with key metrics. and, as press releases will be
posted in their original language, we're looking to include a 'translate this'
function too. in other words, any amount raised will go towards expenses for
tech development, cloud hosting, database acquisitions...(our listed goal is a low $1,000 because we aim to hit the target
quickly and build on that first success towards our final goal of $1,000,000. success begets success!)<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""></span></p>

</span></p>
<p>unbargo
 isn't here to compete with traditional news outlets. but, since it's impossible for them to report
 all the news, we feel readers should still have 
access to everything else that isn't reported too, but on-demand. this is why unbargo is designed as a search 
engine instead of a news website – you search for what you want, and you get
 only what you want. because, when you like something, whether it's food or fashion, don't you want
 to be the first to know everything about it fast and first? now, at the exact 
moment anything is released to a reporter, often months before it's even
 reported, you’ll know it too:</p>
<ul>
<li>latest mobilephone – 2 months ahead</li>
<li>newest japanese cafe - 3 months ahead</li>
<li>hottest high-street wear - 5 months ahead</li>
<li>upcoming family movie - 6 months ahead</li>
<li>launch of luxury bag - 10 months ahead</li>
<li>brand-new supercar - 12 months ahead<br/><br/>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>could unbargo benefit reporters?</h3>
<p>all reporters have stories they 
care about get cut all the time. very often, even important stories are 
cut  – just because editors 
deem them unsuitable for reasons they rarely share. unbargo lets reporters tell their untold stories. 
they 
just need to get verified on unbargo to be given publishing rights, a 
special icon and the choice to withhold their identity. once a reader 
sees that special icon, they'll know they're reading a piece by someone 
whom we've authenticated as a reporter from a respected online or 
offline publication, and who cares enough to get their news out.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>are press releases useful?</h3>
<p>at first glance, compared to your everyday news report, a press
release may seem just too detailed (pls scroll all the way to the bottom to see an actual <i>apple watch</i> press release). but, when you want to know more about that topic – suddenly ""too much info""
becomes goldilocks' ""just right"". unbargo's
most useful topic is perhaps <i>advisory news</i> - it could literally save your life. right
now, advisory news is only available on hundreds of different websites, such as health
alerts from the cdc, the wanted list of the fbi or an important product recall.
with unbargo, you can get all advisories emailed to you (see below) so you can keep your family and
friends safe. <br/></p>

<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>unbargo advisories can keep my family and friends safe?</h3>
<p>hundreds of consumer
products were recalled last year in the united states alone to prevent
deaths or injuries - but how many of these did you hear about? various independent watch sites frequently publish product recalls when problems are detected, but the press rarely
reports these unless they are part of a ""bigger story"" – like after a
fatality has occurred. this means we're usually in the dark about
dangers we've brought into our own homes! when brands are responsible enough to issue an alert, for e.g. ""<b>IKEA Recalls Crib Mattresses Due to Risk of Entrapment</b>"" (see below), unbargo plays its
part by delivering such advisories to your inbox immediately!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1391201/files/20150417044250-61edd66bb6b08e892516d5261e973f7c_original.png?1429270970"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>newspaper feature<br/>
</h3>
<p>the press is sometimes painted as the dark side,
 or as controlled by rich owners with their own personal or political 
agenda to create their 'news of the world'. you've no idea how many 
messages we've received from contributors denouncing the press for picking what to report.</p>
<p>but to be fair, there are limited 
column inches available in any printed publication, and even on an 
unlimited platform like the internet, there are only so many hours in a day to report the news. when faced with such space and time constraints, picking becomes a 
necessity.</p>
<p>however, picking shouldn't be based on 
preference or prejudice. not preference because that's a story close
 to your heart, nor prejudice because your mind is already closed to that story.
 if a story needs to be told, it should stand purely on its merits and 
be reported. and that's one of the rare utopian beliefs that can and should have a 
place in our society today.</p>
<p>unfortunately, many news empires are helmed by traditional executives and gatekeepered by conservative 
editors. thus, when it comes to picking news, it tends to be based on 
preference or prejudice still.</p>
<p>so after a reporter from <i>mypaper</i>
 interviewed us, then told us later that our story might 
be pushed to another date, which is the usual lingo for ""no go!"", we 
assumed the powers-that-are had objected, as 
standard press may see unbargo as a threat or competitor.</p>
<p>so imagine our surprise when this article eventually came out. thank you <i>mypaper</i> (lydia lam, you rock!).</p>

ever—featuring revolutionary new technologies and a pioneering user 
interface with a beautiful design that honors the rich tradition of 
precision watchmaking. Apple Watch introduces a specially designed and 
engineered Digital Crown that provides an innovative way to scroll, zoom
 and navigate. The Digital Crown is Apple’s most revolutionary 
navigation tool since the iPod® Click Wheel and iPhone® Multi-Touch™. 
Apple Watch will enable you to communicate in new ways right from your 
wrist by sending and receiving messages, answering calls to your iPhone,
 and with Digital Touch, sending something as personal as your own 
heartbeat. Apple Watch also introduces comprehensive health and fitness 
apps that can help people lead healthier lives. Apple Watch is available
 in three distinct collections—Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple 
Watch Edition.</p>
<p>“Apple introduced the world to several 
category-defining products, the Mac, iPod, iPhone and iPad,” said Tim 
Cook, Apple’s CEO. “And once again Apple is poised to captivate the 
world with a revolutionary product that can enrich people’s lives. It’s 
the most personal product we’ve ever made.”</p>
<p>“With Apple Watch, 
we’ve developed multiple technologies and an entirely new user interface
 specifically for a device that’s designed to be worn. It blurs the 
boundary between physical object and user interface,” said Jony Ive, 
Apple’s senior vice president of Design. “We’ve created an entire range 
of products that enable unparalleled personalization.”</p>
<p>Apple Watch
 introduces a revolutionary design and iOS-based user interface created 
specifically for a smaller device. Apple Watch features the Digital 
Crown, an innovative way to scroll, zoom and navigate fluidly, without 
obstructing the display. The Digital Crown also serves as the Home 
button and a convenient way to access Siri®. The Retina® display on 
Apple Watch features Force Touch, a technology that senses the 
difference between a tap and a press, providing a new way to quickly and
 easily access controls within apps. Apple Watch introduces the Taptic 
Engine and a built-in speaker that together discreetly enable an 
entirely new vocabulary of alerts and notifications you can both hear 
and feel. Apple custom-designed its own S1 SiP (System in Package) to 
miniaturize an entire computer architecture onto a single chip. Apple 
Watch also features Wi-Fi 802.11b/g and Bluetooth 4.0 to pair seamlessly
 with your iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple Watch comes in three distinct 
collections—Apple Watch, Apple Watch Sport and Apple Watch 
Edition—available in two different sizes, 38 mm and 42 mm. The 
beautifully designed and durable enclosures are crafted from custom 
alloys of polished or space black stainless steel, space gray or silver 
anodized aluminum and 18-karat rose or yellow gold. Apple also created 
an entire range of watch straps: the high-performance elastomer Sport 
Band; the Milanese Loop in a flexible magnetic stainless steel mesh; the
 Leather Loop in soft, quilted leather that conceals magnets for quick 
fastening and adjustment; the leather Modern Buckle, which closes with a
 solid metal clasp; the leather Classic Buckle; and the stainless steel 
Link Bracelet. Apple Watch comes with a unique charging system that 
combines Apple’s MagSafe® technology with inductive charging for a quick
 connection that snaps into place.</p>
<p>Apple Watch is an extremely 
accurate timepiece that’s also customizable for personal expression. 
Apple Watch comes with 11 watch faces ranging from traditional analog 
faces to new faces like the dynamic Timelapse face; the Astronomy face 
with its interactive, real-time 3D model of the earth, sun, moon and 
planets; and the Solar face, a contemporary sundial. Apple Watch can be 
personalized in appearance and capability with additional information 
such as upcoming events, moonphases or your activity level, enabling 
millions of possible configurations.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of its 
location on your wrist, Apple Watch provides timely information that can
 be viewed at a glance. Smart Replies and dictation let you respond 
quickly to messages, and with Handoff, you can start a message on your 
Apple Watch and continue where you left off on your iPhone. Swipe up 
from the watch face for Glances that quickly show you information you 
care about, such as your current location, stocks or your next meeting. 
Pressing the side button brings up Friends, a view of your favorite 
people, so you can contact them quickly and easily. Digital Touch allows
 you to send a sketch, a gentle tap, an audio message through Walkie 
Talkie or even your own heartbeat. Apple Watch lets you interact quickly
 and conveniently with the world around you, so you can pay for coffee 
using Apple Pay™,* board a plane with a Passbook® boarding pass, control
 your Apple TV® or get directions. </p>
<p>Apple Watch includes a 
groundbreaking Activity app designed to help motivate you to be more 
active throughout the day, and an all-new Workout app designed to 
provide the metrics you need during dedicated workout sessions. Apple 
Watch uses the accelerometer, a built-in heart rate sensor, GPS and 
Wi-Fi from your iPhone to provide a comprehensive picture of your daily 
activity. The Activity app measures three separate aspects of movement: 
calories burned, brisk activity and how often you stand up during the 
day. The Workout app provides goal-setting and pacing during popular 
session-based workouts, such as running and cycling. The companion 
Fitness app on iPhone collects your activity data so you can see your 
activity history in greater detail. Apple Watch uses this history to 
suggest personal, realistic goals, reward fitness milestones and keep 
you motivated.</p>
<p>Apple introduces WatchKit, providing new tools and 
APIs for developers to create unique experiences designed for the wrist.
 With Apple Watch, developers can create WatchKit apps with actionable 
notifications and Glances that provide timely information. Starting 
later next year, developers will be able to create fully native apps for
 Apple Watch.</p>
<p>Pricing &amp; Availability
Apple Watch will be available in three collections. Apple Watch, with a 
polished or space black stainless steel case and a choice of straps; 
Apple Watch Sport, with a space gray or silver anodized aluminum case

tips



as media insiders ourselves, we know reporters get their stories in two main ways – they get lucky with sources (not the way you think), or they get a press release.
most of the time, they get a press release.




trashed




but of the tons of press releases reporters get, less than 5% are published due to space constraints and rigid editorial approval.
the rest end up in the trash.


 



""but,"" you might protest, ""who's to say some news in that discarded 95% of press releases wouldn't interest me?""


 


""precisely,"" we will answer. ""strangers who don't know you – mostly editors – are deciding what news you get to know.""*cue darth editor and his bright saber







this sucks.


 
lightbulb











so we had a lightbulb moment!



how about a revolutionary search engine that takes all the same press releases reporters get and feeds that news to the world for free?



that way, not only would you get to choose the news that's important to you, and get it fast, you'll know everything reporters do, and know it first too – before it's even reported.


 

freedom



unbargo is for you if you believe in freedom, and if you believe:
• you're the only person who should decide what news matter to you




• you've the right to all the news meant for you





• you don't need somebody else thinking for you




 
 help free the news.
(and we'll help you free your smartphones and tablets from wires with our thank-you gift!)








why the need for unbargo?

unbargo makes the world a better place as it provides a 
borderless service
for any newsmaker anywhere to post their news for anyone to read. the
one and only purpose of any press release is to reach the reader. but, newsmakers 
usually need to persuade reporters first. even if reporters are convinced, they 
still need to find an angle to win their editors over.
and if their editors agree, those press releases need to be re-written 
and edited, before they're published much later, days or sometimes months after they were
 received. in our perhaps-idealistic
viewpoint, news should be reported because of newsworthiness, not because of
better contacts or finances. by providing a free service for 
newsmakers to get news out directly to 
readers, we're leveling the playing field for businesses of all sizes. 
plus, we made it much, much simpler with unbargo. just send your press 
release to news@unbargo.com 
and it will be auto-extracted, ready to reach readers, unedited and 
uncensored.



who is behind unbargo?
our international team comprises former-and-current news folks in both old
 and new media – from print newspapers and magazines to online news, tv and radio – including a former editor-in-chief of two major rival 
national newspapers (not at the same time of course). thus, we've the 
edge as we already have unfettered access to press releases worldwide.



how does unbargo get its press releases?
besides
 us already having access to tons of press releases daily, tens of thousands 
more will be sent to unbargo every day by newsmakers direct, and 
pr agencies on behalf of their clients. all these press releases will be auto-converted to web format and instantly uploaded so news 
gets out asap – which is what newsmakers need and what readers want. all press releases are
presented under 20 separate categories, spanning hard and soft news, from business to beauty and tech to travel.






what's the difference between unbargo and existing wire agencies?wire agencies
are for the press, unbargo is for readers. wire agencies aim to persuade the press to feature news so as to reach readers, but while this may have been
necessary in the past when going through the press was the only way, the
internet changed all that. unbargo is focused on creating a reader-centric,
reader-friendly service, one that delivers news straight from the source
(newsmakers) direct to readers. 



name 3 highlights of unbargo?
1. it's familiarunbargo looks the same on mobile or desktop, and on different OS or browsers, because we insist
on similarity. you'll always know
the functions you're already used to seeing instead of re-exploring where each is on the different platforms and how each works all over
again (try spotting the differences of facebook on mobilephone and tablet
below). unbargo's font size even cleverly adjusts to accommodate the viewing
distance and screen size of specific gadgets.




2. it's smartunbargo is
designed to learn from you. whenever you search, it gets better at giving you
the most relevant news right at the top, so you get what you're looking for
faster each time. and every time you click ""x"" on search results that
aren't what you want, not only will those results be removed from (just) your
view, making it easier for you to focus, unbargo will also learn how to better
spot what you want in future.


                                         


3. it remembersunbargo
provides a history page
(see below), for you to re-access everything instead of
wracking your brain remembering what you read before. you can remove anything
from this page easily by clicking the delete button. history also contains
keywords you used during specific searches so you can fine-tune your results. readers who wish to can keep searches anonymous simply by not logging in.




                                       

what does unbargo need funding for?so far we've paid for unbargo's development out of personal conviction, but to make it the world-changing revolution it can be, we need help funding the crucial extras. we'll have to store millions of press releases around the world annually, as well as
the mountains of hi-res photos that come with them – and storage is costly even
with cloud hosting (good thing there's youtube so we don't need to store videos too!). also, we're working hard to make our search engine capable of giving
you relevant results instantly, so it's literally available to you the second it's sent to
reporters. at the same time, we're negotiating with third parties to bring past press releases to
you, to create the most complete database in the world. in the works as well is analytics for newsmakers with key metrics. and, as press releases will be
posted in their original language, we're looking to include a 'translate this'
function too. in other words, any amount raised will go towards expenses for
tech development, cloud hosting, database acquisitions...(our listed goal is a low $1,000 because we aim to hit the target
quickly and build on that first success towards our final goal of $1,000,000. success begets success!)







is unbargo against traditional news outlets?


unbargo
 isn't here to compete with traditional news outlets. but, since it's impossible for them to report
 all the news, we feel readers should still have 
access to everything else that isn't reported too, but on-demand. this is why unbargo is designed as a search 
engine instead of a news website – you search for what you want, and you get
 only what you want. because, when you like something, whether it's food or fashion, don't you want
 to be the first to know everything about it fast and first? now, at the exact 
moment anything is released to a reporter, often months before it's even
 reported, you’ll know it too:

latest mobilephone – 2 months ahead
newest japanese cafe - 3 months ahead
hottest high-street wear - 5 months ahead
upcoming family movie - 6 months ahead
launch of luxury bag - 10 months ahead
brand-new supercar - 12 months ahead






could unbargo benefit reporters?
all reporters have stories they 
care about get cut all the time. very often, even important stories are 
cut  – just because editors 
deem them unsuitable for reasons they rarely share. unbargo lets reporters tell their untold stories. 
they 
just need to get verified on unbargo to be given publishing rights, a 
special icon and the choice to withhold their identity. once a reader 
sees that special icon, they'll know they're reading a piece by someone 
whom we've authenticated as a reporter from a respected online or 
offline publication, and who cares enough to get their news out.





are press releases useful?
at first glance, compared to your everyday news report, a press
release may seem just too detailed (pls scroll all the way to the bottom to see an actual apple watch press release). but, when you want to know more about that topic – suddenly ""too much info""
becomes goldilocks' ""just right"". unbargo's
most useful topic is perhaps advisory news - it could literally save your life. right
now, advisory news is only available on hundreds of different websites, such as health
alerts from the cdc, the wanted list of the fbi or an important product recall.
with unbargo, you can get all advisories emailed to you (see below) so you can keep your family and
friends safe. 

            


unbargo advisories can keep my family and friends safe?
hundreds of consumer
products were recalled last year in the united states alone to prevent
deaths or injuries - but how many of these did you hear about? various independent watch sites frequently publish product recalls when problems are detected, but the press rarely
reports these unless they are part of a ""bigger story"" – like after a
fatality has occurred. this means we're usually in the dark about
dangers we've brought into our own homes! when brands are responsible enough to issue an alert, for e.g. ""IKEA Recalls Crib Mattresses Due to Risk of Entrapment"" (see below), unbargo plays its
part by delivering such advisories to your inbox immediately!








when will unbargo be launched?
beta
 will be ready by may 2015, with the full launch three months later.

testimonials
here are some unsolicited testimonials we've received. we confirm certain unrelated 
sentences have been omitted or amended from the original quotes, but 
context has not been altered or enhanced, except that text has been 
reproduced in lowercase following corporate guidelines. we can also 
confirm no animal, plant, human nor alien was harmed in the production 
of these testimonials.
















newspaper feature

the press is sometimes painted as the dark side,
 or as controlled by rich owners with their own personal or political 
agenda to create their 'news of the world'. you've no idea how many 
messages we've received from contributors denouncing the press for picking what to report.
but to be fair, there are limited 
column inches available in any printed publication, and even on an 
unlimited platform like the internet, there are only so many hours in a day to report the news. when faced with such space and time constraints, picking becomes a 
necessity.
however, picking shouldn't be based on 
preference or prejudice. not preference because that's a story close
 to your heart, nor prejudice because your mind is already closed to that story.
 if a story needs to be told, it should stand purely on its merits and 
be reported. and that's one of the rare utopian beliefs that can and should have a 
place in our society today.
unfortunately, many news empires are helmed by traditional executives and gatekeepered by conservative 
editors. thus, when it comes to picking news, it tends to be based on 
preference or prejudice still.
so after a reporter from mypaper
 interviewed us, then told us later that our story might 
be pushed to another date, which is the usual lingo for ""no go!"", we 
assumed the powers-that-are had objected, as 
standard press may see unbargo as a threat or competitor.
so imagine our surprise when this article eventually came out. thank you mypaper (lydia lam, you rock!).

<p><span>We are an adventurous family of eight, starting a traveling journey around the nation, to explore, meet our country face-to-face, and to bring back some useful strategies for rural resilience to our upstate New York communities. We have been living and working in the rural Albany County hilltowns for the last five years, deeply embedded in our community, running a general store (see medusageneralstore.blogspot.com), and raising a young family. The state of the economy, steady warming of our planet, the sense of isolation faced by many in our region, and the seeming lack of any help on the horizon has led us to this latest quest.</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h3>What are we up to?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>While there are lots of examples of urban sustainability projects, from innovative urban agriculture to high speed transport to green energy, there are remarkably few maps provided to those of us in rural areas. The possibility that the new economy will be primarily one of dense urban areas causes many of us to wonder: are we relevant? Will many rural regions, with their small villages and towns, cease to exist altogether? Most importantly, are there examples of rural resilience we can borrow? Are there farming regions on the fringe of metropolitan areas that have embraced the principles of the new economy in a way that has generated social equity, prosperity and a plan for climate resilience? </p>
<br/><p>I am a PhD, with a history of work in sustainable community development, and a deep commitment to our rural regions. I have a background in research, concentrated on judgment and decision making, as well as system dynamics modelling. This project will focus on interviews and mutual sharing of experiences, both successes and failures, and plans for the future. We will provide a clear record of our interviews and talks, mapping our way via the web across the country. Where possible, we will provide video footage and photography, as well as any relevant and available data and analysis. When complete, we will finally have a compilation of the types of rural resilience and long term sustainability projects that offer hope and promise.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<br/><p>We are seeking monetary support - we are attempting to fund this project through our own savings and through crowdsourced dollars. We have some money saved, but need some more to cover gas and food for a few months on the road. We have a charming 1976 L'Espirit RV, a tent and crazy amounts of enthusiasm. </p>
<p>We are anticipating an April 1 departure, depending on weather and finances.

</div></div>","Who are we? 
We are an adventurous family of eight, starting a traveling journey around the nation, to explore, meet our country face-to-face, and to bring back some useful strategies for rural resilience to our upstate New York communities. We have been living and working in the rural Albany County hilltowns for the last five years, deeply embedded in our community, running a general store (see medusageneralstore.blogspot.com), and raising a young family. The state of the economy, steady warming of our planet, the sense of isolation faced by many in our region, and the seeming lack of any help on the horizon has led us to this latest quest.

What are we up to?

While there are lots of examples of urban sustainability projects, from innovative urban agriculture to high speed transport to green energy, there are remarkably few maps provided to those of us in rural areas. The possibility that the new economy will be primarily one of dense urban areas causes many of us to wonder: are we relevant? Will many rural regions, with their small villages and towns, cease to exist altogether? Most importantly, are there examples of rural resilience we can borrow? Are there farming regions on the fringe of metropolitan areas that have embraced the principles of the new economy in a way that has generated social equity, prosperity and a plan for climate resilience? 
I am a PhD, with a history of work in sustainable community development, and a deep commitment to our rural regions. I have a background in research, concentrated on judgment and decision making, as well as system dynamics modelling. This project will focus on interviews and mutual sharing of experiences, both successes and failures, and plans for the future. We will provide a clear record of our interviews and talks, mapping our way via the web across the country. Where possible, we will provide video footage and photography, as well as any relevant and available data and analysis. When complete, we will finally have a compilation of the types of rural resilience and long term sustainability projects that offer hope and promise.

How can you help?
We are seeking monetary support - we are attempting to fund this project through our own savings and through crowdsourced dollars. We have some money saved, but need some more to cover gas and food for a few months on the road. We have a charming 1976 L'Espirit RV, a tent and crazy amounts of enthusiasm. 
We are anticipating an April 1 departure, depending on weather and finances. The trip is flexible - so we are going for as long and far as money allows. the more cash we can raise, the longer we will be on the road. The first $500 will complete some needed repairs and renovations on our RV - we will be posing  video as soon as that is complete!  
We have also been compiling lists of those communities who fall into one of two categories - they are either very similar to our rural communities, in terms of demographics, geography or history, or they offer specific solutions that have proven beneficial to their rural communities. We are asking for your help with either of those lists, specifically the latter - nominate a place for us to visit!
We will be uploading tentative maps as soon as possible. For now, we are roughly planning a route south, then west. We are very excited about this journey - a pilgrimage to America, so to speak - and welcome your input.  And we look forward to having you along for the ride!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

I signed up to participate in a brain-wave biofeedback study. Learning
to control your brain waves by looking at flashing lights sounded
interesting. Also they paid more than I was making mowing the greens
at a nearby golf course. Due to the flip of a coin, I was selected to be
a control subject in the study, meaning that I received no instructions
whatever; I was just hooked up with electroencephalogram (EEG)
wires stuck all over my head and left in total darkness and total silence,
in a soundproofed room in the physiology lab, for two to three hours
at a time, every day for several weeks.</span></p><div><div><div>
<p>At the time, I had never heard of meditation. Not knowing what
else to do, I simply paid attention to what was going on. Gradually
my senses opened up in ways that I had no words to describe. My
sense of self melted into the dark. I merged with blackness and infinity and entered a world of spacious peace. Space itself seemed to be
made out of harmony. </p>
<p>Walking out of the lab each afternoon, I felt refreshed and wonderful. It was as if my entire previous life had taken place in a mild
sleep state, and now I was fully alert. It was as if I had never seen
the world before, and everything alive seemed to glow, especially
the trees. I began to appreciate every detail of light, every touch
of air, every sound, with extraordinary clarity. Light itself seemed <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">soluble, an elixir I was drinking in through my eyes and the pores
of my skin. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I was drenched in moving peacefulness. The
perceptions seemed natural—as if this is the way the world has always
been—but I had been too oblivious to notice.</span></p>
</div></div></div><div>
<div>
<div>
<p>The feeling was similar to the peaceful joy of surfing, but more intense and steady. I felt like <i>myself</i>, but this was a self I
had never spent time in before. I was very much in my body, aware of
the current of life flowing through me, and at the same time I could
feel an extended sense of touch reaching out in all directions. I was
in love with existence.
</p>
<p>The experiment continued for weeks. I enjoyed going to the lab
each afternoon and sitting there in the dark for hours, then walking
out into the light and discovering a new world. I got used to living
in this free and open state in which I just breezed through tasks that
previously had been chores. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I noticed that even taking calculus tests was easy; my mind was
lucid, and I could remember a formula that I had glanced at the night
before, then derive its applications right there during the test.</span></p>

or so after the experiment was over. It was a continuous and self-

from inside the same pulsating current of life force that I was being
introduced to.

<p>My experience in the lab taught me that meditative attention
occurs spontaneously. From the Bhairava Tantra I learned that there

</li> <li>I am a complete book fanatic (mostly crime thrillers and Terry Pratchett) but I also like a good magazine to flick through. I love my bikes and thought I would like the press that is out there for bikers and yet I have been left cold by its lackluster female interest. According to DVLA statistics, there are 500,000 female bike license holders in the UK, so why is the industry so poor at pitching their press to this rapidly growing market? I did some surveying amongst my lady biker friends and got a lot of feedback, most of which was in agreement with my findings of nothing out there for women, only testosterone fueled pages and design that makes you feel that a lack of XY chromosomes means bikes are off limits. I set about getting a subscribers behind my project and managed to get the first edition off the ground hoping that the pace would continue to pick up a plethora of advertisers would help me keep the printing going, while my lovely lady subscribers kept the content rolling in. <br/>
</li> <li>My problem is, despite my best efforts, the advertisers have remained 
absent and I can't afford to print the now due second edition. I need 
the money to satisfy the current 250 subscribers with the next edition, and also to up the ante on marketing to persuade the advertising community that it will be a worthwhile publication to advertise in. I honestly believe that once the ball is really rolling this will be a success as there is so much I can offer that the standard biker mags can't, in that I have a personal connection with my readers, and am encouraging them to be my reporters, columnists and contributors. It is something they can call their own and be a part of, and hopefully, with the right support, it will become a hub for lady bikers worldwide!<br/>
</li> </ul> <br/> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><br/></p> <ul> <li>My funding will go toward the printing costs (c.£1500) and postage (£400), as well as advertising the publication to encourage more subscribers and to pitching it at advertisers so they can offer their support in the future.<br/>
</li> <li>As a sponsor, you will get to advertise your business if you have one, your charity if you prefer or have mention of your support in the editorial. You get to choose how you are remunerated in fact. If you want to be part of the team, i.e. a partner in the business, I am even prepared to entertain that for your continued investment and support. It really is up to you!<br/>
</li> <li>If I don't make the entire amount, it will still go to the project as I have previously described. I fully intend to keep nagging people to get behind me until I am on my knees. I KNOW this project is worthwhile and will become a success if I get enough support, it's just getting people inspired enough to want to take female biking seriously - as seriously as I do!</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><br/></p> <ul> <li>I am a professional graphic designer and marketer. I am solely managing the design and marketing of the publication and am happy to do that. I have a band of very willing supporters that include journalists and photographers as well as printers who are all doing their bit to make this happen. It isn't without risk - no investment is. Of course I may never be able to get this off the ground but the 4,500 Facebook supporters I have, and the 250 or so subscribers who have already got on board definitely feel it is something they want. I get a steady flow of interest and I just want to increase that and make this a force to be reckoned with, and something that becomes a brand to trip off the tongue like MCN or 100% Biker.<br/>
</li> <li>I don't give up easily and I already have a lot on my plate, yet I am prepared to take on more. I love challenges and hate being proved wrong. I am tenacious and confident. I am bold and almost precocious with my self belief when the bit is between my teeth. If I get the support I need, I will do my utmost to make it happen! I often get called a fixer in my professional life, and I believe this rings true with my projects...<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p><br/></p> <ul> <li>If you can't afford a fiver, don't worry, your desire to help can be actioned by sharing and spreading the word about The Lady Motorcyclist! Social Media is a contemporary bush telegraph - let it do the work!<br/>

I set about getting a subscribers behind my project and managed to get the first edition off the ground hoping that the pace would continue to pick up a plethora of advertisers would help me keep the printing going, while my lovely lady subscribers kept the content rolling in. 
 My problem is, despite my best efforts, the advertisers have remained 
absent and I can't afford to print the now due second edition. I need 
the money to satisfy the current 250 subscribers with the next edition, and also to up the ante on marketing to persuade the advertising community that it will be a worthwhile publication to advertise in. I honestly believe that once the ball is really rolling this will be a success as there is so much I can offer that the standard biker mags can't, in that I have a personal connection with my readers, and am encouraging them to be my reporters, columnists and contributors. It is something they can call their own and be a part of, and hopefully, with the right support, it will become a hub for lady bikers worldwide!
     What I Need & What You Get   My funding will go toward the printing costs (c.£1500) and postage (£400), as well as advertising the publication to encourage more subscribers and to pitching it at advertisers so they can offer their support in the future.
 As a sponsor, you will get to advertise your business if you have one, your charity if you prefer or have mention of your support in the editorial. You get to choose how you are remunerated in fact. If you want to be part of the team, i.e. a partner in the business, I am even prepared to entertain that for your continued investment and support. It really is up to you!
 If I don't make the entire amount, it will still go to the project as I have previously described. I fully intend to keep nagging people to get behind me until I am on my knees. I KNOW this project is worthwhile and will become a success if I get enough support, it's just getting people inspired enough to want to take female biking seriously - as seriously as I do!    
Risks & Challenges
  I am a professional graphic designer and marketer. I am solely managing the design and marketing of the publication and am happy to do that. I have a band of very willing supporters that include journalists and photographers as well as printers who are all doing their bit to make this happen. It isn't without risk - no investment is. Of course I may never be able to get this off the ground but the 4,500 Facebook supporters I have, and the 250 or so subscribers who have already got on board definitely feel it is something they want. I get a steady flow of interest and I just want to increase that and make this a force to be reckoned with, and something that becomes a brand to trip off the tongue like MCN or 100% Biker.
 I don't give up easily and I already have a lot on my plate, yet I am prepared to take on more. I love challenges and hate being proved wrong. I am tenacious and confident. I am bold and almost precocious with my self belief when the bit is between my teeth. If I get the support I need, I will do my utmost to make it happen! I often get called a fixer in my professional life, and I believe this rings true with my projects...

<p></p>
<p>Oh my goodness, folks! I got into a <a href=""http://www.voicesatvona.org/mission/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">literary program</a>
 that’s even better for my
needs and goals: VONA, founded by lmaz Abinader, Junot Díaz, Victor Díaz
 and Diem Jones in 1999, develops emerging writers of color through 
programs and workshops taught by established writers of color.Over 2,000 writers from around 
the globe have participated in VONA...and now, <i>thanks to you</i>, I get to be one of them!

</p>
<p>The program cost is the same as it was for Lambda which is $1,350 and
 they awarded me a partial scholarship of $400. This means that with 
your generous support I’ll be able to attend with only spending a 
minimal amount from my own pocket.
<i><b>Thank you so much! Your support has been incredible and invaluable. I couldn’t have done it without you! </b></i></p>
<p>With gratitude,</p>Ola]<br/><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>Dear Community,<br/><br/>I've been writing most of my life, but only in the past few years - through the gentle coaching of some incredible writing mentors and peers - have I started to value my literary voice. <i><b>I was recently accepted into the prestigious VONA, which marks the first time any literary accomplishment of this sort has been bestowed on me.</b></i> This people of color focused writers workshop, the only one of its kind throughout the US, will enable me to strengthen my craft and, eventually, access opportunities to get my essays and short stories published. <br/><br/>Here's more information about the <a href=""http://www.lambdaliterary.org/writers-retreat/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.voicesatvona.org/workshops/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">workshop</a>. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>$1,350 is what I need to make this dream of mine come true.<i><b>Your contributions will be essential in helping me cover the retreat's tuition and expenses.</b></i></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>
<i><b>By donating to my fundraising campaign, you're helping to add to the chorus of queer and trans African literary voices.</b></i> For many of us, intense and virulent homophobia/transphobia means that our bodies become sites of state-sanctioned violence, while our stories are sensationalized and/or invisibilized. <i><b>I
want my writing to give voice to those African activists who have to
organize in the shadows, and embolden others who have nowhere to turn and no resources to support them.</b></i> I want my
writing to paint a more colorful and layered picture of what being Nigerian can
look like. VONA represents an opportunity for grounding in my mission as
a writer and a chance to find the structure, instruction, mentorship and
community I need to grow my craft.
<i><b>You can help me manifest this mission by adding your support to my campaign. </b></i></p>
<br/>
</div><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Every little bit helps! Helping to spread this word about my fundraising campaign - posting about it on your social media pages or emailing your friends about it - can also be quite impactful. <br/>

 and Diem Jones in 1999, develops emerging writers of color through 
programs and workshops taught by established writers of color.Over 2,000 writers from around 
the globe have participated in VONA...and now, thanks to you, I get to be one of them!


The program cost is the same as it was for Lambda which is $1,350 and
 they awarded me a partial scholarship of $400. This means that with 
your generous support I’ll be able to attend with only spending a 
minimal amount from my own pocket.
Thank you so much! Your support has been incredible and invaluable. I couldn’t have done it without you! 
With gratitude,Ola]
Short SummaryDear Community,I've been writing most of my life, but only in the past few years - through the gentle coaching of some incredible writing mentors and peers - have I started to value my literary voice. I was recently accepted into the prestigious VONA, which marks the first time any literary accomplishment of this sort has been bestowed on me. This people of color focused writers workshop, the only one of its kind throughout the US, will enable me to strengthen my craft and, eventually, access opportunities to get my essays and short stories published. Here's more information about the workshop. 
  
What We Need & What You Get $1,350 is what I need to make this dream of mine come true.Your contributions will be essential in helping me cover the retreat's tuition and expenses.

  The Impact 
By donating to my fundraising campaign, you're helping to add to the chorus of queer and trans African literary voices. For many of us, intense and virulent homophobia/transphobia means that our bodies become sites of state-sanctioned violence, while our stories are sensationalized and/or invisibilized. I
want my writing to give voice to those African activists who have to
organize in the shadows, and embolden others who have nowhere to turn and no resources to support them. I want my
writing to paint a more colorful and layered picture of what being Nigerian can
look like. VONA represents an opportunity for grounding in my mission as
a writer and a chance to find the structure, instruction, mentorship and
community I need to grow my craft.
You can help me manifest this mission by adding your support to my campaign. 

 Other Ways You Can HelpEvery little bit helps! Helping to spread this word about my fundraising campaign - posting about it on your social media pages or emailing your friends about it - can also be quite impactful.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Harrison and discusses his unconventional approach and how he plans to turn the publishing world on it's head for reader and writer alike.<p></p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When first coming up with the idea for RRPI, what was the thought process? If you could pick a few things that you wanted to do differently than the competition, what would you say those are?<br/><br/><strong>A: </strong>The thought process behind the creation of RRPI was to end the elitism. I was a real estate agent after I got out of the Marine Corps, as such I provided a service to buy and sell homes. There was no legal requirement behind our position, only the tradition and ease of completion to use an agent. The same is true about the current publishing industry. There is a sense of ""You need us"".<br/><br/>Not anymore. Anyone can publish a book through a wide variety of means. So what do you need a publishing company for? What point is there to have one sign you? Exposure? They commonly target authors who have a large social media following. Marketing assistance? Not much. Generally they'll plop a few shares and that's it. So this is where I thought of something different.<br/><br/>I want to open the flood gates and mentor authors. I want their bright and wonderful ideas, I want to help mold them into something that can bring merriment to the masses. I want to help them grow into something fantastic. So I thought ""How do you do that?"" I bounced ideas off of my wife and Ashley, our Branding Director, and came up with a solid concept.<br/><br/>RRPI is a company that goes after the small fry to help them complete their dream of becoming a professional author. We figure out how they work, how they think, and what they need that they can't easily do themselves. Some people need a boot in the rear end, whereas others need to know that what they're writing isn't garbage, while some just need a timeline for completing work.<br/><br/>Every unknown author has been tread upon by society, their friends and family, publishing companies or more. With each submission for a contest, or query, I give them an answer, “Yes” or “No”, but more importantly, why. I detail what I liked and disliked about their story. Where I would go with it and what they should do. Currently there are two people who submitted to me for publishing and I told them to go back and fix things then I'll sign them. It is a test to see if they can adapt.<br/><br/>So in short, RRPI is about the author bringing their best, adapting their best to give the reader the easiest path into their mind. A path to see the worlds and characters that are hidden away. A path to bring joy and love, adventure and intrigue, and so much more to the world.<br/><br/><strong>Q: </strong>When you say you accept all submissions, that means you're giving everything a fair chance, right?<br/><br/><strong>A: </strong>Correct. We accept submissions for consideration to publish from any genre and experience level. We also do not limit submission times to certain dates like other companies. We believe this hinders the possibility to have creative people come to us. Creativity doesn't know timetables.<br/><br/><strong>Q: </strong>So would you say you focus more on creativity than the average company?<br/><br/><strong>A: </strong>We focus on the author and their creative process. We take time to understand their abilities and limitations and work with them to bring out their best for the reader.<br/><br/><strong>Q:</strong> My understanding of traditional publishing is limited, but it seems like authors have more input with RRPI than the average publisher. How intentional is that?<br/><br/><strong>A: </strong>One-hundred-percent intentional. When I created RRPI, I wanted authors to work with us through the process and learn what needs to be done. Not sit in the dark and wait for orders. If they know what it takes, they build trust with RRPI and it becomes easier with each book that comes through the mill.<br/><br/><strong>Q: </strong>You don't have genre limitations and you have said you don't go after an established author. Is there something particular you're trying to offer readers that you feel like they aren't currently being offered by the industry?<br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> Open creativity. With genres and established authors you get preconceived notions. With a mix of genres or new authors you get surprises. It's a way to bring new things to the world of literature and show that not everything needs to be put neatly into a box. The real world is messy and so are the worlds that our authors create. RRPI wants to bring a whirlwind through the literary community and we want every reader to be caught up in the flow.<br/><br/><strong>Q:</strong> With that in mind, what is your process for deciding if an author and work would be a good fit with RRPI? What kind of issues are you willing to help an author work through that more traditional publishers would move past?<br/><br/><strong>A: </strong>I don't look at the word count or the genre. I don't care about that. A good story is something that speaks to you. If I get that feeling of hunger to read more while reading someone's submission, I love it. If I don't realize how long it took me to read it, I dive after the author to get them to sign with me. I will work through most any issue with an author. We have a few authors that have severe anxiety issues, others with families that take precedence, not to mention day jobs. Our job as a publishing house should be to make sure that our authors are happy; happy authors equal productive authors. Authors who feel included, who feel communicated to, who feel that their needs are important to the publishing house will work harder than anyone else out there. Its how I've always treated people I work with and people in my personal life. It's how I got my wife to marry me, well that and constant pestering until she said yes.<br/><br/><strong>Q: </strong>How does RRPI balance the unforgiving business world with the creative process? Those two things usually seem at odds with each other.<br/><br/><strong>A:</strong> They very much are. We work with the author to establish what real life requirements they have and set dates, goals, deadlines, etc. based off that. It's like balancing a truck on a toothpick, but it is possible. The key is to be as aggressive as your life allows you to. To plan far ahead of time so that you have plenty room for error and adaptation.<br/><br/><strong>Q: </strong>You mentioned being a real estate agent and there is definitely an undertone of the Marine Corps in some of your answers. Are there things from these other fields that you think offer an edge?<br/><br/><strong>A: </strong>I think that one must experience life before they move into what they want and are meant to be. As a real estate agent I had to field my own business opportunities by finding clients out of the blue. It allowed me to work independently and develop my own style of business management and leadership. As a Marine, of course it lends a lot to my perspective. Everything in business needs to be looked at coldly and my training taught me how to look at a problem from an outside perspective.<br/><br/><strong>Q: </strong>Awesome. That leads directly into my next question. How do you plan to do that? We've talked a good bit about what you're offering authors, but what about the competition? Do you view other publishing venues--traditional, indie, self--as competition?<br/><br/><strong>A: </strong>I don't believe that they are competition. They have different talent, different books, and different perspectives. RRPI is unique just as every other publishing house or self-publisher is unique. We bring our own sense of flare and style to the scene just as they do. I plan to revolutionize the publishing scene by producing quality books while shoving against the stigma that you must define your own niche in publishing in order to develop credibility. I believe consistency and customer service creates credibility. That is what I plan to offer and plan to execute by our daily existence as a company.<br/><br/><strong>Q: </strong>What advice do you have for people who are still trying to get to the point of being ready to publish and maybe feeling overwhelmed by the whole process?<br/><br/><strong>A: </strong>The answer is always “no” unless you ask. Just stop, breathe for a moment, and move on. If you get rejected, it's all right. Everyone has been rejected, they know how you feel. You aren't alone. I've fought just like you have to find my place in the world. I've fought to accomplish my dreams, to come back from nothing. I and many others are right there beside you. You may not see us, but you're on the same trail as we are. Remember this and persist. I want to see what story you have to tell, and so does the rest of the world. Keep writing, things will get better.</p>

<p>    Cid reached up to scratch his head. He
grunted when the attempt was thwarted by the strap of his goggles and the thick
leather glove on his hand. It had escaped his mind that he was wearing either.
He looked at his hand for a moment, debating whether the itch was irritating
enough to warrant taking off the glove and removing his goggles. He opted to
use the spanner in his left hand to get it instead.<br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">“Fucking pointless,” he
muttered to himself and then threw the spanner back into his toolbox, knocking
off the blueprints that sat on top. The box jostled and the lid slammed shut.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    The </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">machine</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> stood in front of him,
dominating the room. Its outer shell, constructed from brass and silver, had
two great domes that reached up to the ceiling of the control room. It was
finished. The steam turbine had been tested and the cooling systems were in
place, the condensers and pumps ready to work and every wire connected. The
only thing missing was the fuel—the </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Anthonium</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    Cid chewed on his
nail; he didn’t stop when the leather of his glove came between his teeth
instead of his fingernail. Absentmindedly, he chewed on the glove instead.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    “How long has he been
gone?” Cid called to one of the workers nearby. The short and rotund man looked
up at the clock on the wall and then glanced back.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    “Umm, an hour?” the
man said with a shrug before scuttling off to get on with his work.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    “Awfully useful, you
are,” Cid grumbled. He headed to the machine and fiddled with the controls
inside a hatch, muttering to himself.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    The door to the room
on the level above opened and Cid turned to look up at the balcony. The
Professor entered, his long blond hair flowing with each stride. Cid had
expected his employer to bring the </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Anthonium</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">
in so they could test the </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">machine</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> tonight.
Instead, the Professor had brought a girl with him. Her own mop of blond curls
bobbed as they walked together into the room.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    Cid scrunched up his
face. He tried to remind himself that this was the Professor’s project. His
pride and joy, his design, built with his money, and if he wanted to show it
off for the sake of some skirt, that was his choice. Still, it didn’t stop Cid from
feeling irked by the situation. Not that he would dare allude to that fact.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    “What does it do?”
Cid heard the young woman ask.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    “It’s a small-scale
fission reactor, used to generate power through a sustained chain reaction. The
heat generated from the reaction with the core element is passed through a
fluid, which releases steam. The steam powers a set of turbines which pass a
charge to a generator.”<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    Cid sunk his forehead
into his hand as he listened to the Professor attempt to explain the most
complex machine in the entire world to someone who clearly had no concept of
it. It was like listening to a physics Professor explain the workings of the
universe to a monkey.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    “It will do wonders
for our world, Larissa,” the Professor continued. “This will give us incredible
power, make our furnaces obsolete, and block out the winter. With this, we’ll
be masters of our enemies. I need only one more element to make it work.”<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    Cid just about
managed to stop himself from bursting into fits of hysterical laughter when he
heard the Professor promising all kinds of love and affection to the poor,
startled creature in exchange for the one thing Cid needed—and perhaps a few
more things the Professor desired.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    Before Cid realized
it, the girl had agreed. Now, she handed over her necklace, complete with the </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Anthonium</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> they’d been so desperate to find.
Cid watched with one eye between his fingers as the Professor scooped her into
an embrace and dropped the necklace over the balcony.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    Cid caught it. He
uncurled the fingers of his glove. It was a much smaller sample than he had
planned for, but it didn’t matter. It was enough. He ripped the chain of the
necklace from the stone, discarded it, and turned to the machine.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    One side panel was
open; a small housing sat ready for the </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Anthonium</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.
He inserted the stone into the clips and stood back. In his haste he forgot to
shut the panel. Sweat dripped from his brow. His heart thumped inside his chest
as he took to the controls and prodded the buttons.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    The machine clicked
and whirred into life. The initial readouts were good. The generator was
operational. The cooling towers came online. From one second to the next, the
entire thing had come alive, and most importantly of all...<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    “By the Gods!” Cid
yelled. “It’s working, Professor. It’s fucking working.”<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    The Professor turned,
smiling down at Cid until the girl grabbed him, resuming the kiss. Some odd
noises came from the direction of the door on the level above; several thumps
that didn’t sound like knocking. Without warning, the entire doorway exploded
inwards with a deafening boom. Chunks of wall and wood shattered. The
aftershock from the blast sent the Professor and the girl tumbling over the
balcony. Cid turned, grabbed the blueprint on his toolbox, and rushed for cover
behind one of the tall cabinets, his heart thumping against his ribs.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    The sound of gunshots
echoed around the room, followed by a hiss. Cid shut his eyes tight and waited.
It had all been a waste, a complete and utter waste of time and effort. A
final, massive explosion rocked the entire building to the core. Something
smacked into the side of his head and blackness surrounded him.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    He awoke scrunched in
a ball behind the cabinet. The acrid smell of smoke assaulted his senses. As he
tried to breathe, his lungs protested the lack of clean air. Cid crawled out
into hazy darkness. What remained of the machine still burned, billowing smoke
and ash into the room. The roar of the fire blocked any other sounds. Bodies charred
nearby in the flames.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    Through the smoke he
saw the young woman sprawled out on her back; the Professor was gone. Cid
crawled toward her, dragging himself along and keeping as low to the ground as
he could. As he drew close to the fire, he realized he still clutched the
blueprints—the only copy. He passed one final glance up at the machine, tossed
the blueprint into the flames, and reached out to grab the girl. She seemed to
be the only thing left to save.</span></p></div>","Behind The BooksAaron Hughes, Managing Director of RRPI sits down with author J.K. Harrison and discusses his unconventional approach and how he plans to turn the publishing world on it's head for reader and writer alike.

It allowed me to work independently and develop my own style of business management and leadership. As a Marine, of course it lends a lot to my perspective. Everything in business needs to be looked at coldly and my training taught me how to look at a problem from an outside perspective.Q: Awesome. That leads directly into my next question. How do you plan to do that? We've talked a good bit about what you're offering authors, but what about the competition? Do you view other publishing venues--traditional, indie, self--as competition?A: I don't believe that they are competition. They have different talent, different books, and different perspectives. RRPI is unique just as every other publishing house or self-publisher is unique. We bring our own sense of flare and style to the scene just as they do. I plan to revolutionize the publishing scene by producing quality books while shoving against the stigma that you must define your own niche in publishing in order to develop credibility. I believe consistency and customer service creates credibility. That is what I plan to offer and plan to execute by our daily existence as a company.Q: What advice do you have for people who are still trying to get to the point of being ready to publish and maybe feeling overwhelmed by the whole process?A: The answer is always “no” unless you ask. Just stop, breathe for a moment, and move on. If you get rejected, it's all right. Everyone has been rejected, they know how you feel. You aren't alone. I've fought just like you have to find my place in the world. I've fought to accomplish my dreams, to come back from nothing. I and many others are right there beside you. You may not see us, but you're on the same trail as we are. Remember this and persist. I want to see what story you have to tell, and so does the rest of the world. Keep writing, things will get better.

PROLOGUE
    Cid reached up to scratch his head. He
grunted when the attempt was thwarted by the strap of his goggles and the thick
leather glove on his hand. It had escaped his mind that he was wearing either.
He looked at his hand for a moment, debating whether the itch was irritating
enough to warrant taking off the glove and removing his goggles. He opted to
use the spanner in his left hand to get it instead.    “Fucking pointless,” he
muttered to himself and then threw the spanner back into his toolbox, knocking
off the blueprints that sat on top. The box jostled and the lid slammed shut.    The machine stood in front of him,
dominating the room. Its outer shell, constructed from brass and silver, had
two great domes that reached up to the ceiling of the control room. It was
finished. The steam turbine had been tested and the cooling systems were in
place, the condensers and pumps ready to work and every wire connected. The
only thing missing was the fuel—the Anthonium.    Cid chewed on his
nail; he didn’t stop when the leather of his glove came between his teeth
instead of his fingernail. Absentmindedly, he chewed on the glove instead.    “How long has he been
gone?” Cid called to one of the workers nearby. The short and rotund man looked
up at the clock on the wall and then glanced back.    “Umm, an hour?” the
man said with a shrug before scuttling off to get on with his work.    “Awfully useful, you
are,” Cid grumbled. He headed to the machine and fiddled with the controls
inside a hatch, muttering to himself.    The door to the room
on the level above opened and Cid turned to look up at the balcony. The
Professor entered, his long blond hair flowing with each stride. Cid had
expected his employer to bring the Anthonium
in so they could test the machine tonight.
Instead, the Professor had brought a girl with him. Her own mop of blond curls
bobbed as they walked together into the room.    Cid scrunched up his
face. He tried to remind himself that this was the Professor’s project. His
pride and joy, his design, built with his money, and if he wanted to show it
off for the sake of some skirt, that was his choice. Still, it didn’t stop Cid from
feeling irked by the situation. Not that he would dare allude to that fact.    “What does it do?”
Cid heard the young woman ask.    “It’s a small-scale
fission reactor, used to generate power through a sustained chain reaction. The
heat generated from the reaction with the core element is passed through a
fluid, which releases steam. The steam powers a set of turbines which pass a
charge to a generator.”    Cid sunk his forehead
into his hand as he listened to the Professor attempt to explain the most
complex machine in the entire world to someone who clearly had no concept of
it. It was like listening to a physics Professor explain the workings of the
universe to a monkey.    “It will do wonders
for our world, Larissa,” the Professor continued. “This will give us incredible
power, make our furnaces obsolete, and block out the winter. With this, we’ll
be masters of our enemies. I need only one more element to make it work.”    Cid just about
managed to stop himself from bursting into fits of hysterical laughter when he
heard the Professor promising all kinds of love and affection to the poor,
startled creature in exchange for the one thing Cid needed—and perhaps a few
more things the Professor desired.    Before Cid realized
it, the girl had agreed. Now, she handed over her necklace, complete with the Anthonium they’d been so desperate to find.
Cid watched with one eye between his fingers as the Professor scooped her into
an embrace and dropped the necklace over the balcony.    Cid caught it. He
uncurled the fingers of his glove. It was a much smaller sample than he had
planned for, but it didn’t matter. It was enough. He ripped the chain of the
necklace from the stone, discarded it, and turned to the machine.    One side panel was
open; a small housing sat ready for the Anthonium.
He inserted the stone into the clips and stood back. In his haste he forgot to
shut the panel. Sweat dripped from his brow. His heart thumped inside his chest
as he took to the controls and prodded the buttons.    The machine clicked
and whirred into life. The initial readouts were good. The generator was
operational. The cooling towers came online. From one second to the next, the
entire thing had come alive, and most importantly of all...    “By the Gods!” Cid
yelled. “It’s working, Professor. It’s fucking working.”    The Professor turned,
smiling down at Cid until the girl grabbed him, resuming the kiss. Some odd
noises came from the direction of the door on the level above; several thumps
that didn’t sound like knocking. Without warning, the entire doorway exploded
inwards with a deafening boom. Chunks of wall and wood shattered. The
aftershock from the blast sent the Professor and the girl tumbling over the
balcony. Cid turned, grabbed the blueprint on his toolbox, and rushed for cover
behind one of the tall cabinets, his heart thumping against his ribs.    The sound of gunshots
echoed around the room, followed by a hiss. Cid shut his eyes tight and waited.
It had all been a waste, a complete and utter waste of time and effort. A
final, massive explosion rocked the entire building to the core. Something
smacked into the side of his head and blackness surrounded him.    He awoke scrunched in
a ball behind the cabinet. The acrid smell of smoke assaulted his senses. As he
tried to breathe, his lungs protested the lack of clean air. Cid crawled out
into hazy darkness. What remained of the machine still burned, billowing smoke
and ash into the room. The roar of the fire blocked any other sounds. Bodies charred
nearby in the flames.    Through the smoke he
saw the young woman sprawled out on her back; the Professor was gone. Cid
crawled toward her, dragging himself along and keeping as low to the ground as
he could. As he drew close to the fire, he realized he still clutched the
blueprints—the only copy. He passed one final glance up at the machine, tossed
the blueprint into the flames, and reached out to grab the girl. She seemed to
be the only thing left to save.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

These volunteer chefs make an enormous difference, because for most of the youth who seek shelter and a warm, safe place to sleep for the night, this meal is the only food they will eat for an entire day.</p>
<p>It was in 2003, during time volunteering with the Out of the Rain that I discovered how these homeless young people were fed. I learned that the food being served was provided by volunteers who would plan, cook, and deliver this meal for the group of thirty plus. But there was a problem. There were other people who wanted to help, but who had no idea how to cook a meal for that many people. As someone who was both a foodie and who had worked in kitchens in my youth, I had always assumed it was a simple process to take a recipe for 4 and convert it to a recipe for 30.  I learned this was not always the case.</p>
<p>It was out of this need that this idea was born. Inspired by the work of Jamie Oliver (Fifteen Foundation) and Jon Bon Jovi (JBJ Soul Foundation) and driven by wanting to give back, I came up with the idea for a cookbook for volunteer chefs, those angels in the kitchen who give back. From there, the idea evolved. What if proceeds from the sales of the cookbook could be funnelled to help a few agencies? What if beyond enabling people to help, the book itself could directly support these front line programs?</p>
<p>In Victoria BC alone there are over 80 agencies that deal with poverty. And still people go hungry every day in our beautiful city. What if there was a way to enable people, those who know how to cook, or who want to learn to cook to help? And what if at the same time you could create a recurring revenue stream for three agencies that deal with the issue daily?</p>
<p>So I started to research ideas. Over the next few years I talked to people who worked in soup kitchens and food banks. I talked to people on both sides of the poverty equation: those in need and those giving back. From the then Mayor of Victoria to a local farmer, who had the “crazy idea” to help out a street person. I discovered there were inspirational stories right under our noses… stories that I felt deserved be shared. Stories to remind us all you don’t have to be a millionaire or a celebrity to make a difference.</p>
<p>And so Angels in the Kitchen was born.  A cookbook that’s not just a cookbook, but rather the stories of why people give back and who the people are who take the time to help those in need. A book that is more than a book, that is hopefully an inspiration and resource to others as well as an additional revenue funding source for some of the agencies that assist those on the front-lines.</p>

<p></p><p><b><i>The Team</i></b></p><p>This project is being lead by me, Scott Fraser. I’ve lived through poverty and homelessness myself as a teen and young adult, and I was lucky enough to make it out. I know all too well what it’s like to go hungry. I believe that if you teach people how good it feels to give back and help others, that they themselves will pass along that important message. But this isn’t about me, or my experience with poverty, it’s about enabling people to help others. </p>
<p>Since the early 1990's I've been volunteering and helping out because I believed it was important to give back. Professionally during the past 20 plus years, I've worked in marketing and information technologies with skill sets that include photography, writing and online marketing. Over the years I’ve studied social work and related issues at the post secondary level because I needed to understand why the policies and practices that always seem to not be enough were what they were. My professional work as a photographer and photojournalist includes documenting the issues of poverty and those who give back. From a personal perspective, I’ve been there. I first was on the streets as a teenager at the age of fifteen. It was people like these volunteers and agencies that more than once kept me fed. I had been lucky enough to learn how to cook from my grandmother and mother and it is a skill I am grateful to have had passed down to me. As an adult I’ve known what it’s like to try to feed a family on a tight budget. </p>
<p>But this is not a one person project. The team of professionals who are contributing their own expertise to make this project happen is we believe will take it from a dream to a reality. From writers and editors to agency directors and social workers, marketing and SEO (search engine optimization) experts, the team of people who are making this possible are some of the very best in their respected fields. From the chefs and business owners to the staff at the agencies who work daily to provide food, this project is about people making a difference and I am humbled and pleased to be working with such a great bunch of people.</p><p></p>
<p>They suggest when you are setting up your campaign to “Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.”</p>
<p>Any funds received will be applied as laid out in the funding breakdown. The project will continue as the people who believe it will work to get it finished. Personally, I’d rather describe where the funds will go if we exceed our goal. If that happens, the project will push forward with the print edition and more money will go to helping feed those in need. And what if we pass the print edition? Any and all funds above the print edition cost will be split amoung three agencies and 10% going back to the Indiegogo community.</p>

Over the years I’ve studied social work and related issues at the post secondary level because I needed to understand why the policies and practices that always seem to not be enough were what they were. My professional work as a photographer and photojournalist includes documenting the issues of poverty and those who give back. From a personal perspective, I’ve been there. I first was on the streets as a teenager at the age of fifteen. It was people like these volunteers and agencies that more than once kept me fed. I had been lucky enough to learn how to cook from my grandmother and mother and it is a skill I am grateful to have had passed down to me. As an adult I’ve known what it’s like to try to feed a family on a tight budget. 
But this is not a one person project. The team of professionals who are contributing their own expertise to make this project happen is we believe will take it from a dream to a reality. From writers and editors to agency directors and social workers, marketing and SEO (search engine optimization) experts, the team of people who are making this possible are some of the very best in their respected fields. From the chefs and business owners to the staff at the agencies who work daily to provide food, this project is about people making a difference and I am humbled and pleased to be working with such a great bunch of people.
They suggest when you are setting up your campaign to “Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.”
Any funds received will be applied as laid out in the funding breakdown. The project will continue as the people who believe it will work to get it finished. Personally, I’d rather describe where the funds will go if we exceed our goal. If that happens, the project will push forward with the print edition and more money will go to helping feed those in need. And what if we pass the print edition? Any and all funds above the print edition cost will be split amoung three agencies and 10% going back to the Indiegogo community.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>You must've all heard about the story of
the guy who throws starfishes back into the ocean, and when a person walks up
and tells him that throwing one single starfish into the ocean doesnt make much
of a difference, because there are millions of starfish on the beach here, the
guy replies, “It made a difference to this one!”, and he throws another starfish
in. I, for one, believe that this is an example for unconditional love and
support, given to one person at a time.</p>
<p>If every single person in the world loved
themselves, unconditionally, and are there for themselves, no matter what
happens, what would that look like? How would it change their lives?</p>
<p>Majority of people in the world today, are
afraid to voice their opinions. Are afraid to stand up for what they believe
in. Are afraid to do something unconventional with their lives. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>“The Society”. This is the answer we get. </p>
<p>“You are living in a society, and you have
to be like how the rest of them are. Thats the rule.” and “You cant go about
doing your own stuff in the society. What will people think?”</p>
<p>Please tell me one thing here. Who is the
'Society'? Aren't we the society? A group of people put together? Then why is
the society stopping us from doing what feels best for us? Fear, anger,
jealousy, love?</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1382348/files/20150414085659-aaa524386_3409942821805_464402996_n.jpg?1429027019"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>FROM EXIST TO LIVE.</p>
<p>Just about one year ago, I started working
on an experiment on myself. I wanted to see what it takes to live my life to my
fullest, and live it. I wanted to know what my purpose was, in this life. I
wanted to stop just existing, and start Living! It definitely wasn’t easy, but
it was worth the pain. I wasn't working alone though. I had the unconditional
love and support of a few really amazing souls, including me! </p>
<p>This book is about what I was earlier – a
clueless person, a depressed soul, a procrastinator, a couch potato, you name
it! I was filled with various inferiority complexes, jealousy, shame and anger
towards myself and the society. - And how I have transformed into a soul who is
aware of her purpose, someone who's filled to the brim- and overflowing with
unconditional love, a healthy eater, and an aspiring runner. I am now working
on keeping myself fit. </p>
