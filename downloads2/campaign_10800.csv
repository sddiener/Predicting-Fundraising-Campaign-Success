The following video shows real reactions of users experiencing Woojer Edge for the first time. All were filmed at E3, along Venice Beach, and Hollywood Boulevard in June 2019.  Forget just hearing sound. We’re enabling you to feel sound. Woojer is a progressive sensation that boasts an amplified level of immersion. Imagine standing right next to a huge bass cabinet. You know that oomph you feel in your body? That energy pulsing into your bones? That’s what Woojer feels like.  It gives you everything that your headphones simply can’t.     

  Sound is air movement that typically spreads as an audible wave of pressure. Headphones gather that audible part, but you’re missing out on the movement. That’s where Woojer steps in. We enable you to enjoy both aspects of sound. Simply put on the strap or vest, connect the audio and start feeling the sound.   
 

  
After all the feedback we received from 70K+ users, we decided to create a new series that everyone can dig. We’re bringing you the Woojer Edge series that’s flexible enough to cater to the music professional, casual gameplayer, film enthusiast, dedicated gamer, music lover and to anyone who’s simply curious enough to know what it means to feel sound. We’ve rigged this series with CSR APTX low-latency Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity and Texas Instruments built in analog headphone amplifier. We played around a bit with the arrangement of the transducers, improved the Osci, and kept the incredible sensation to ensure that the Woojer Edge Series is for everybody.  
 A powerful, high-fidelity haptic experience in transportable form. The Strap Edge is built to go with you, so you can have the Woojer Experience no matter where you are. Wear it around your hips, on your chest or cross-body, and then fold it up and place it in your backpack when you’re done. Amp up your workouts, vibe up your walk to work, and stimulate your gameplay. Don’t just move through the day, immerse yourself in the day.

It has an ergonomic design that can perfectly fit in every unique ear shape.We dedicated 240 days to researches with 3D printing and modeling tests, analyzed against thousands of human ear shapes. So in terms of comfort level, EarFun Free Earbuds are second to none.Never worry about losses of earbuds no matter the case they’re in is closed or opened. EarFun Free’s magnetic tech creates a rock steady fit and attracts the earbuds to the case when they are near to it.  The most frustrating part of wireless devices is that constant stopping to reset and reconnect is a pain when connection issues occur. To eliminate this hassle, we concentrated R & D on creating a super stable, worry-free connection.EarFun Free is powered by the most advanced Bluetooth 5.0 protocol which dramatically enhances the stability and connection of the earbuds. After a one-time setup, the earbuds will automatically turn on and pair with your smart device. Just open the case and wear them,  EarFun Free works flawlessly within a range of 15 Meters (49 Feet).  Take EarFun Free with you even when kayaking or surfing! EarFun Free is protected by the Innovative SweatShield Technology. We developed this unique technology that hermetically seals the internal circuitry so EarFun Free will keep every single bead of sweat on the outside where it belongs.     Most of the “waterproof earbuds” on the market use the nano-coating method to resist water. However, the coating is easily corroded after only 1-3 months usage. On the contrary, EarFun Free’s SweatShield Technology is immune to corrosive sweat as well as water.  Graphene is an incredibly strong and lightweight latticed carbon super-material that has incredible electrical conductivity. These unique properties make it the perfect material for compact audio drivers. They use less power than traditional drivers to produce better sound in smaller packages efficiently. Compared to non-graphene drivers, they are more accurately reproducing sound with more clarity, separation, and details. The graphene driver in EarFun Free delivers sound on par with larger more expensive speakers without the bulk or expense.  No wires, no worries. Power up your EarFun Free by simply placing the charging case on the wireless charging pad. If you already have a Qi charging pad, you can use it to juice up EarFun Free as well.To provide over 4000-hours standby time, EarFun Free particularly designed the circuit with exceptionally low-power consumption and equipped with the high-quality lithium battery from VDL. More than 4000 hours which is about 6 months of standby time and with the current lower than 50 μA, EarFun Free is now 10 times the standby time of competitors. It undoubtedly renders EarFun Free the longest standby true wireless earbuds!Voice command makes it more convenient control of EarFun Free. You can easily access your voice assistant to make a phone call, choose your music and more. Using this process, you don’t even need to take your phone out of your pocket or touch it.  Built-in MEMS microphone with noise cancellation assures your crystal-clear hands-free call in noisy circumstances.Many earbuds suffer from imprecise touch control that can result in false signals that interrupt your listening experience or accidentally hang up a call. It can also be difficult to exert control when working out. EarFun solves this problem with a special control button that triggers command with only 80g of force, about half of the pressure needed by typical earbuds. The result is smooth and accurate control changes only when you want them. Matte FinishSay Goodbye to annoying fingerprints Every customer of the EarFun will receive this Thank You Card once the contribution delivered. After getting your EarFun Free, you can share your story with EarFun on any channels. For your sharing, we will donate 1 dollar to UNICEF. Even 1 dollar could make a difference! We appreciate it a lot for your kindness!We've started mass production of black color in early May, so all of the black color EarFun Frees will be shipped within May. For the white color, we will start the mass production in June, and these will be shipped at the end of June.EarFun was established in 2018 by an experienced group of industrial designers, acoustic engineers and music enthusiasts who shared the goal of creating next-generation wireless audio devices.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How mc.brick can produce such rich sound and deep bass?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Thanks to its two 40mm drivers, which represents a total power of 10 watts, but also thanks to its really large passive subwoofer of 100x25mm - - 4*1 inches, which almost stretches to the full width of the speaker, mc.brick is able to deliver an amazing high quality and lound sound with outstanding and deep bass.<br/><br/><strong>Key features:</strong>
</p><ul>
<li>stereo, 2 x 5W 40MM - 1.6 inch drivers, 4Ohm</li>
<li>Passive subwoofer 100*25MM - 4*1 inches</li>
<li>Large speaker cavity inside for excellent sound effects</li>
<li>Buddy-jack audio output function to connect 2 or more mc.brick together<br/>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Connect or plug mc.brick to any device!</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Such as all the Mova Systems portable speakers, mc.brick can easily connect to any device, such as phones, smartphones, tablets, laptop, desktops and much more, using one of the three following methods:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><ul>
<li>Tap-to-pair using NFC technology to get a quick connection to a 
device knowing this is available on most of smartphones. Just activate 
the NFC functionality on your device if it is not done yet and approach 
it to the right upper part of mc.brick. The connection is made automatically and you can enjoy mc.brick immediately.</li>
<li>Your device is not NFC friendly ? This is not a problem as you can pair mc.brick using the classic Bluetooth method.</li>
<li>Anyway, mc.brick can also be connected to a device using the 3.5MM audio jack supplied. You can also connect a mc.brick speaker to another speaker using the audio jack output<br/>
</li>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With its two front-facing 40MM drivers, a total output of 10W and its passive bass radiator, mc.mini can easily take up the challenge.</p>
<strong>Key features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>stereo, 2 x 5W 40MM - 1.6 inch drivers, 4Ohm</li>
<li>Passive subwoofer 25*40MM - 1*1.6 inches</li>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">mc.mini can easily connect to any device using one of the three following methods:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><ul>
<li>Tap-to-pair using NFC technology to get a quick connection to a device knowing this is available on most of smartphones. Just activate the NFC functionality on your device if it is not done yet and approach it to the right upper part of mc.mini. The connection is made automatically and you can enjoy mc.mini immediately.</li>
<li>Your device is not NFC friendly ? This is not a problem as you can pair mc.mini using the classic Bluetooth method.</li>
<li>Anyway, mc.mini can also be connected to a device using the 3.5MM audio jack supplied.</li>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our speakers are fully developed  and 
they are working perfectly. Our beta testers, friends and family are 
testing them since June, using them everyday and everywhere. All the 
small issues we faced are now solved. So there is no more risk at all 
with the product quality.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is why the only risk which remains is 
the failure to comply with the timeline we determined. We determined it 
in partnership with the factory in charge of the production and we are 
supposed to be able to observe it. However, sometimes small 
complications arise and it is important to make sure that everything is 
up to our standards. We are committed to supply amazing products and we 
will of course prioritize quality. But no doubt, we will do our best to 
observe the deadline.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Do not worry, in case of delay, we will notify everyone so there will be no suspense and no surprise.</p>

Our speakers are fully developed  and 
they are working perfectly. Our beta testers, friends and family are 
testing them since June, using them everyday and everywhere. All the 
small issues we faced are now solved. So there is no more risk at all 
with the product quality.
This is why the only risk which remains is 
the failure to comply with the timeline we determined. We determined it 
in partnership with the factory in charge of the production and we are 
supposed to be able to observe it. However, sometimes small 
complications arise and it is important to make sure that everything is 
up to our standards. We are committed to supply amazing products and we 
will of course prioritize quality. But no doubt, we will do our best to 
observe the deadline.
Do not worry, in case of delay, we will notify everyone so there will be no suspense and no surprise.

We are three young entrepreneurs who had and still have the desire to develop and commercialize connected objects that could improve people’s lives. We started working on our wireless portable speakers more than one year ago and we set up the company in last August, once we were sure about the products and about where we want to go.
Our main goal is to provide devices and accessories of high quality with excellent value for money. We have the will to invest heavily in research and development to improve our products but also to develop new products.

  Cooperation PartnersLORENZ KELLERSwitzerland's best-known gadget tester has taken a close look at the B&B PURE.  Music adjusted to You!  PURE is the worlds first customizable headphone that adapts to your unique hearing. By pairing advanced algorithms with exact hearing results we can create an incredibly accurate sound wave that is adjusted to your ears. Experience music like never before and hear the full spectrum of your sound.     
 Additional Features      SOUND AND DESIGN TUNED FOR YOUR EARSPURE adapts to the listener's personal hearing, increasing sound quality for your ears with the most accurate hearing technology that has been built into a headphone so far. Apart from this key feature B&B PURE offers many other features that you can adjust to fit your lifestyle.
Personalized Sound 
Exchangeable Ear Cups to adjust your comfort or adapt to different situations.
Active Noise Canceling for a perfect isolation 
Integrated charging cable to charge on the go (Fast Fueling) 
Smart functions 
Integrated microphone with Clear Voice Canceling (CVC) 
   Hear every bit of your music! It is now possible to do an intelligent and individual hearing test to make your headphone unique and adjusted to you. Our technology measures your personal hearing signature which is then saved to your headphone. PURE can store multiple profiles, so feel free to add your friends profiles too.   With our flexible switch system you can easily change between on-ear and over-ear Ear Cups to find your comfort and get the best of both worlds. We measured many different heads and ears to make sure you have the most comfortable fit for yourself. Feel free to switch and adapt to different situations: both sizes are included, on-ear & over-ear.   B&B PURE has an integrated cable so you can charge on the go. And thanks to Fast Fueling your headphone is fully charged within minutes. Nowadays you can find USB ports almost everywhere you go. So when traveling with your B&B PURE you will always have everything you need to listen to your music.   Our intelligent play/pause system understands when it needs to pause. So when you take off your headphone it pauses automatically. When you put your headphone back on it continues playing. This function can also be turned off using the B&B PURE APP.  Of course you can use the normal size change mechanism. But how often has it happened that you had to reset your perfect fit because the size changed by itself? It is now possible to lock your perfect fit using the Size Lock. Simply turn the wheel clockwise to lock it and counter-clockwise to unlock it.   Turn on Noise Canceling to filter out annoying frequencies in loud surroundings. You can turn it off whenever you want using the B&B PURE APP.  We installed a dual microphone with CVC (Clear Voice Canceling) for clear phone calls without disturbing background noises. Dual = one microphone to filter out disturbing frequencies (similar to Noise Canceling) and one microphone for a clear voice.   Scuderia Toro Rosso — Racing Team  Music unites and this brought us together with the Formula 1 Team Scuderia Toro Rosso. They are always confronted with music as it motivates them before their races. We are looking forward to supplying them with our headphones to help push them for maximum power.Check out their statements in the video above. Amplifon — Market Leader in Audiology Everybody has a different perception of sound as the ear is a very sensitive part of the body.

   Everybody hears differently as every single person has a different hearing ability. Some do not hear as good as others as they may have a hearing loss in a specific frequency range. So when we started the project we were looking for a solution to get the best sound quality for everybody. A headphone that simply adjusts to your personal hearing ability. We asked ourselves how can we get the perfect sound setting for your ears? So we teamed up with the market leader in audiology and Swiss engineers & designers to create a completely new sound concept adjusted to your ears. We developed an APP on which you can do a hearing test so you can find out your unique sound profile to take your music to the next level.  Measure your personal hearing Create your personal profile using the B&B PURE App. You can create multiple profiles for you and your friends. Your hearing will be tested using 5 different frequency levels: 500Hz, 1KHz, 2KHz, 4KHz, and 6KHz. In the video below you will be able to see the measurement procedure for one of the frequency levels (1KHz). Test for each frequency level: 1. Play the tone2. Listen carefully and press the button once the tone can be heard silently.3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 three times to validate your result.Validation for true results! Each frequency level requires 3 trials to make sure the result is correct. This is in case you may have pressed too early or too late.Exact hearing results = PURE sound quality! 


 
 At the Muba fair (Switzerland) we received the chance to show people our newest prototypes. They were able to hold it and test all the features. What we really appreciated was that people already wanted to buy a headphone at this early point in time. The fair was a great success and we got a lot of great and honest feedbacks. After the fair was over we knew that we were soon ready for our launch on Kickstarter.    The B&B PURE's headband is made with high qualitative, strong but also flexible material. See for yourself:  
 Specifications   Connectivity — Bluetooth & Cable  Charging Options Frequency Response of Generic Sound Our sound concept is extremely balanced. The right amount of bass to give you enough power without having any loss in the higher frequency areas. Thanks to our balanced mid and treble ranges your music will be very clear and you can enjoy an overall wide spectrum of frequencies. This is the frequency response curve when you are listening in generic mode. Feel free to define your own hearing profile to take your music to the next level.
ControlsThere is a touch panel on the right side of the headphone. These are all the controls:

Play/pause or enter/exit phone calls: Press mechanical Button in the middle (Press and hold the center button to turn your headphone ON or OFF)

Next song: Swipe forward (from left to right)

Previous song: Swipe backwards (from right to left)

Volume: Tap the top or the bottom of the circle
    We wanted to find a way to reflect our gratitude to everyone who supports B&B Pure, while also showing you what further possibilities our headphone concept has — Sport Ear Cups. You will be the first and only to to have these special Kickstarter Edition Ear Cups. The backer-exclusive Ear Cups make you stand out from the crowd and show you're listening through an exclusive part of the future of headphone design.Note: Upon reaching the $500'000 stretch goal, you will be able to choose between the normal cushion fabric or the sweat resistant cushion fabric. We will contact backers to confirm their preference before we ship.  You can now have the B&B PURE in one of the two color options: orange/black and gray/black.Note: Upon reaching the $750'000 stretch goal, you will be able to choose between color options. We will contact backers to confirm their preference before we ship.

Auto-sync with video in real time from SmartMike+ App. SmartMike+ records full band audio at 48kHz -- more than six times the frequency of conventional mono microphones (e.g. Apple AirPods).    You can record audio from two SmartMike+s simultaneously (TWS Mode), which is ideal for group interviews, concerts, wedding receptions or other large venues and events. How does it sound? Record & mix vocal from Two SmartMike+s simultaneously in real time.  Simply pair two SmartMike+s with the SmartMike+ App via Bluetooth, the App will automatically switch to TWS mode.   SmartMike+ allows you to mix audio from different audio sources in real time. Using your smartphone to create and remix lip sync, music, and dance videos (with your favorite music, shows, and movies) has never been easier!How does it sound? Mix background music and vocal with SmartMike+ in real time.   Mix up to 7 audio channels with TWO SmartMike+s including: 
Internal mic of SmartMike+;
An optional external mic via the 3.5mm AUX;
The built-in mic on your smartphone;
The stereo background music streamed via A2DP by any third-party streaming App. (Right & Left channel)
Note: iOS - pair with 2-4 SmartMike+s simultaneously. Android 9.0 and above - pair with two simultaneously.    With an embedded intelligent algorithm SmartMike+ is always prepared to record optimum acoustics by reducing sounds like wind or background noise such as people chatting. How does it sound?Recording comparison in outdoor noisy environment Multiple approaches for Noise Reduction:
Multi-level noise reduction embedded algorithm control by the SmartMike+ app.
Windshield for outdoor usage in case of strengthening or actual strong winds/gusts.
An unidirectional microphone is preferable when louder background noise and interference is present.
 Comparison of the noise reduction performances between SmartMike+ and Rode Wireless Go      In powerful M/S (Master/Slave) mode, SmartMike+s can be used with any video recording devices to capture studio quality audio that matches the equally professional video; or with any speakers to amplify the captured audio. Simply hook up one SmartMike+ to your digital camera/ GoPro/ PC/ speaker via a 3.5mm 3-pole male-to-male AUX cable to act as a receiver. Long pressing the button for 10s to pair this SmartMike+ with another (to act as a microphone) via Bluetooth. Note: For optimal performance from a loudspeaker, please make sure to use an external unidirectional mic along with the SmartMike+ (the microphone) to suppress howling.  SmartMike+s can also be used in the same way with any third-party App on a smartphone, such as Filmic-Pro, Tiktok, Facebook Live, YouTube Live, etc. Please use a 3.5mm 4-pole male-to-male AUX cable instead to hook up the receiver SmartMike+ to your smartphone.    This test video is personally made by Sabinetek founder/CEO, Dr. Zhang, in an A/C room using SmartMike+ to record video & audio and Sony ECM-AW4 to capture audio at the same time without any post processing. By comparing the audio track from two microphones, a conclusion can be drawn that Sony ECM-AW4 records much more noises than SmartMike+. SmartMike+ records much clearer audio devoid of the running noise of the A/C.         Stay tuned for more coming new comparison videos with other microphones posted by us.   SmartMike+ recognizes, auto transcripts, and auto generates subtitle files for over 100 languages.  SmartMike+ works with 3.5mm earphones for real time monitoring. Listen to the background music and your own voice, it is best for recording dancing tutorial, or even creating your personal music video.   Press the button on SmartMike+ to start/end recording. During recording, you can easily switch between front and rear camera or pause/resume BGM by a simple double-click of the button on SmartMike+.    SmartMike+ comes with free iPhone and Android apps that gives you total control over your audio and video creation and content. The latest apps and updates for your SmartMike+ can be effortlessly downloaded via OTA.           Develop your own app with free SDK, downloading from sabinetek.net

<div> </div></section></div>","Headphones today may be masterfully designed, but none of them care about your ears' unique sensitivities.
So, just as you wouldn't wear glasses that were made for your friend, why should you use headphones that weren't made for you?





 

Heari is a wireless headphone that integrates our clinically proven and customer acclaimed Aumeo technology and tailors all sound to help you reach your full hearing potential.
Our award-winning technology maps your unique hearing sensitivity to different sounds and then adjusts your music based on your audio profile. The result is a tailored audio experience custom-fit for your ears only.
What's more, you can use Heari's app to adjust sounds to your liking.
Want to enjoy more bass as you're exercising to the beat or boost the voice section of favorite singer's tunes?
Want to have a face-to-face conversation with your friends or family in a noisy environment?
Want to listen to all the details at a seminar or lecture, even though you are sitting at the back of the lecture room?
You can now do that with a few easy clicks.







Every ear processes sound differently thanks to the combination of slight variances in ear bone shape, the hair cells that are responsible for hearing, and, in some cases, hearing loss.

 
Heari's app allows you to take Aumeo's 2 - 3 minute test to accurately determine your unique sensitivities and to build your optimal custom EQ.




 
In addition of Aumeo Technology, Heari also offers a unique feature called Tailored Audio Transparency.
Thanks to 3 included microphones and advanced circuitry, Heari works by recording the sounds around you and then in real time, processing them through your unique hearing profile.
This means you can listen to the entire world around you with the same clarity as your music.
You'll be picking up little details of sounds from TV Shows, live concerts, Seminars or Lectures, face to face conversations and other situations that you never realized were there before!



 
Heari comes with the options of
- Single driver with rich and full sound; or
- Dual dynamic & balance Armature driver that delivers exceptional sweetness and clarity.


With selected models of Heari, it will support MMCX, a connector standard that allows the user to swap the earbuds, so you can switch between all our earbuds, presents or future.
 
That provides you a flexible option of future updates on new earbuds, or exchange earbuds when needed.


 
Heari comes with the famous COMPLY Premium Earphone Tips (Isolation T-Series Cutaway) to further enhance user’s comfort levels and the superior audio experience.
COMPLY TM Foam Tip comes with unique viscoelastic memory foam technology. It conforms to the shape of the ear canal at body temperature for a dynamic custom fit.
Your ear canal shape and size change with movement and temperature. And now your earplugs change with you.
This true fit seals in low-frequency energy. It won’t leak bass, for a richer sound. Materials are also engineered to provide optimal friction coefficient, so tips stay put.

As suggested by lots of media, Heari is the next generation of smart headphone that delivers data-driven customized audio to the consumer in real time.




Heari Specifications:

Premium CSR8675 Bluetooth DSP chip by Qualcomm
24-bit audio processing
3 built-in microphones for optimal quality
Only 3g of weight felt by your ears
All day, 10-hour battery life
MMCX compatible
Durable wire made of aramid fiber
COMPLY Premium Earphone Tips (Isolation T-Series Cutaway) tailored to different ear shapes
Your choice of high quality single or dual dynamic & balanced armature drivers

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Have you ever rocked out or kicked back to live music in Asheville? We've recently lost some treasured live venues and the ones hanging on could use your help! We are organizing this venue benefit record with the help of artists from our passionate music community to help venues who have been adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic, and subsequent venue shutdowns. The compilation record is titled ""They Gave Us A Stage: Asheville Artists For Venues"" as homage to our venues that have continually supported the local arts and have given a platform to all creators to showcase their works. </p>
<p>All proceeds from this record will be given directly to The Grey Eagle Music Hall and Slygrog Lounge to help them keep their stages open until safer times. Your purchase counts, save Asheville live music! If we can sell over 500 we can continue to help other Asheville venues, let's do this!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We would love to sell <strong>500</strong> of these limited run records <strong>before </strong>presale ends which would help us raise a good chunk of change to give our venues immediately! If we sell even more records, we can continue to give. </p>
<p>Don't take our word for how kick ass this record is going to be, check out the line up of talent!</p>
<p><strong>Contributing artists:</strong> Papadosio, Alexa Rose, Empire Strikes Brass, Tall Tall Trees, Steep Canyon Rangers, Vaden Landers, Battery Powered Hooker Boots, Travers Brothership, Christy Lynn Band, and Secret Shame.</p>
<p>With your contribution you will receive a 180g limited press 10 song LP. Choose the ""Name in the liner notes"" option at check out to get your name in the records liner notes! It will be dressed up with Asheville music inspired art from<strong> Jenny Greer Fares of Soundmind Creative</strong>. Vinyl masters will be cut by yours truly at <strong>American Vinyl Co </strong>on our recently restored Neumann mastering lathe for a big and warm listening experience. Pop this record up on your turntable for a range of genres that all flow together to show how diverse and special our music community is. Be proud that you supported your venues when they needed it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Right now music venues all over are struggling in order to keep their communities safe and help curb the spread of the virus. Venue owners, music lovers, and industry workers are frightened that it could have a permanent impact on live music and the livelihood of their staff. Venues have been able to have limited capacity outdoor shows but still unable to return to normal indoor events. Raising this money will help The Grey Eagle and Slygrog Lounge (more venues if enough records are sold!) pay bills, keep their staff paid, and bridge the pandemic until it is safe enough to return to enjoying music indoors once again. The more records we sell the more we can help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Challenges would be to raise enough money to create the first 500 records. American Vinyl Co is no stranger to record production and will deliver a high quality vinyl record. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford the vinyl record, help spread the word on your social accounts or around town! Unfortunately, we can't offer these works digitally but if you don't have a record player just display the vinyl record proudly on your wall! Also, there is an option to give what you can and it is truly appreciated!</p>

Combined with the widest bandwidth AuricSound output transformer design, the A7 ""EX"" features tauter bass control and thermally quiet circuit design. The result is pure music. Stereo Integrated Tube Amplifier A-7 EXEmploys innovative fully-digitized processing that delivers a pure and accurate signal to the speakers.Every finely crafted AuricSound is refined to bring music to life with stunning vividness and realism and to convey music with the very breath of life present in the recording studio or concert hall. AuricSound products are masterpieces because they allow each recorded performance to be heard with the musical authenticity the musicians intended.To bring this sonic purity and dimension of sound to the discerning ears of our customer, AuricSound uses vacuum tube technology almost exclusively. A passion for superb sound quality and expert attention to detail is also required to refine each piece to its peak of performance. Great care is evident in every note sounded by an AuricSound. This is an appreciation that can only grow over a lifetime of listening for the music lover. Listen and let the sound be your guide!VACUUM TUBE  +  SOLID-STATE AMPLIFIERSA7 ""EX""A vacuum tube power amplifier with ambitionThe A7 ""EX"" has an elegant dark BLACK and METALLIC BLUE finish, realizing a modern classical appearance reminiscent of our finest legacy products. This model’s improved clarity and warm, accurate audio reproduction, unique to vacuum tube products, and the quality of the components and engineering shine through. We strongly feel that the introduction of new technology and added customization will prove integral to this model’s appeal as a modern day vacuum tube amplifier.VACUUM TUBE  +  SOLID-STATE outputThe output vacuum tubes are known for their power and rich sound quality. The triode configuration employed achieves longer vacuum tube life and a highly transparent timbre that vacuum tube amps are known for. The paralleled first stage feeds a driver stage featuring performance proven hybrid circuitry. For the final stage, we have adopted a hybrid compatible push-pull configuration to achieve an output power of 150 Watts per channel at 4 and 8 Ohms with very low distortion.JENO Engine (Jitter Elimination and Noise-shaping Optimization)Just like the A-7 EX is a fully-digital amplifier and delivers high-resolution digital signals without any distortion being introduced between the input stage and output to the speakers. AuricSound has developed an original jitter-reduction circuit, avoiding the sound quality degradation due to jitter common to conventional digital amps. It uses a clock generator for the noise-shaping system to reduce jitter in the low-frequency range and a high-precision sample rate converter to suppress jitter in the high-frequency range.LAPC (Load Adaptive Phase Calibration)AuricSound has developed a speaker impedance optimization algorithm, using digital signal processing to flatten both the amplitude and phase-frequency response to make the most of your speakers.

<p>EarOn – the smartest Bluetooth earpiece in the world, equipped with microphone system in an ear. With the innovative EarOn a user may exclude any foreign noises and clearly hear only the sound of their earpieces. With EarOn your voice will be distinct even in noisy environment. The users may also use EarOn to listen to music! Listen to your favourite melodies in between calls and business meetings without the problem of broken wires.</p>

Unlike loudspeakers that vibrate sound into air, HUMU Augmented Audio Cushion™ contains a single, proprietary Flexound Augmented Audio module with patented Elastic Vibrating Elements to vibrate sound into an intelligent foam interior. It produces a soft, near-field listening experience which minimizes disturbance to others in the vicinity of the device, even when listening to bass-heavy frequencies. HUMU Augmented Audio Cushion™ covers the whole frequency range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz with a single element, while the vibrating sensations are felt most at lower frequencies up to 500 Hz. Middle and high frequencies create a spatially augmented HUMU Augmented Audio Cushion™ sound sphere, a personal binaural stereo soundscape.

<p>We live in a world where your personal sound is both more important and more accessible than ever before. Where once music lovers were content to wear low-fidelity, tinny headphones or, worse, stick annoying earbuds in their ears, those who prefer to have their lives continually scored may now choose from a plethora of high-quality, high-fidelity headphones that bring truly remarkable sound reproduction straight to their eardrums. There’s just one problem, however, with the current crop of great headphones out there.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://powermuffs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PowerMuffs-Brown-Ashley-7.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>No matter what product or product line you love, no matter what music company has your loyalty, no matter what style is your personal expression and choice, if you live somewhere that the weather is not picture perfect all year ‘round... you will eventually find that you can’t wear your beloved headphones and listen to the music you so dearly want to hear. That’s because when the weather turns cold, the average headphones simply can’t keep your ears warm while also delivering high quality sound. Heck, some of us just wear earmuffs as fashion statement!<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://powermuffs.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PowerMuffs-Black-Ashley-1.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>The solution is PowerMuffs, the warmest sound in the world. In anything but pleasant, sunny weather, standard headphones, even high-quality headphones that command premium prices, aren’t up to the task of keeping you wired for sound. PowerMuffs can deliver high-quality sound in even unpleasant weather. Whether it’s just a little chilly or it’s freezing outside, whether it’s raining lightly or snowing like mad, PowerMuffs protect your ears and keep them (and you) warm and comfortable... while also giving you the high-quality sound reproduction that lets you enjoy your music in premium fidelity. PowerMuffs are attractive, stylish, and wonderfully warm earmuffs with Bluetooth compatible speakers and a built-in microphone.<br/> <div style=""background-color: #000;color: #fff;font-size: 34px;font-weight: bold;padding:20px;width: 604px;"">AWESOME FEATURES</div>

<p>Since the first Walkman was introduced in 1979, people have enjoyed being able to bring their music wherever they go with ease. But the one big disadvantage of the Walkman was shared by almost every other portable music player until only recently, and that is that they all had cords. No one wants their music on a leash. Dealing with the cord keeps you from enjoying your music as freely as you deserve to enjoy it. Say no more to cord hassle with wireless Bluetooth compatibility. PowerMuffs can be used with virtually any Bluetooth capable device, making them the perfect way to listen to your music -- not to mention switching easily to phone calls and back again. Cords are no longer holding you back when you have Bluetooth-capable PowerMuffs!</p>
<p><b>PowerMuffs Offer Stylish, Flexible Design</b></p>
<p>There was a time when people had to learn to conform to technology. Remember those iconic Walkman headphones? They weren’t very attractive and they weren’t very ergonomic... but in the early 1980s, anyone who was anyone was wearing a pair of those flat, spongy, tinny headphones around their necks. It was as much as fashion statement as it was a bold declaration of one’s devotion to enjoying one’s music on the go. But now, technology has advanced to the point where we no longer have to conform to function over style. Now, we can have style and function in a seamless package, and we can declare our style as easily as we do our allegiance to the music we love. PowerMuffs look and feel great. They’re not just comfortable and warm; they are also great looking, and can be the perfect accent to any fall or winter outfit. But don’t think you can’t wear your PowerMuffs when the temperature rises, either. These are the perfect fashion statement for all temperatures and moods, provided you’re bold enough to strut your stuff with your PowerMuffs on your head or neck.</p>
<p><b>PowerMuffs Come in Brown, Black, or White</b></p>
<p>Did we say fashion? One of the problems with the current field of “art” headphones is that, while they look very attractive by themselves, they often don’t look very good when paired to your actual clothes. You don’t want to draw unnecessary attention to just one part of your clothing or accessories, after all. You want your headphones to look like they belong with your outfit overall. That’s where PowerMuffs’ stylish color choices come into play. We offer comfortable, well-made PowerMuffs in one of three universal colors to keep it simple: brown black, and white. Black will go with almost anything, but for those outfits where brown is a better fit, you can have that, too. White is as neutral as you get and pretty much matches with everything. Buy one of each and always be prepared for whatever your mood and whatever the weather. It’s the perfect system for both your music and your messages.</p>
<p><b>PowerMuffs Feature Lightweight Adjustability to Fit Any Size Head</b></p>
<p>If you’re worried about cramping your style or weighing yourself down when you try to step out in style with your music, don’t be. Every pair of PowerMuffs weighs in at just 140 grams. They’re not just lightweight; they’re also adjustable to fit any size head. That means you can get the perfect fit with ease when you wear your PowerMuffs, no matter what the outfit, weather, or occasion. Just slip them on, adjust them to suit yourself, and head on out. And if something changes (like your hairstyle or your accessories), you can readjust the PowerMuffs to perfectly fit the new you.</p>
<p><b>PowerMuffs Offer Premium Dynamic Sound</b></p>
<p>None of this would matter if PowerMuffs did not also offer great, high-fidelity sound. You can immerse yourself in premium quality audio every time you wear your PowerMuffs... and you can look great while doing it. Don’t settle for lower-quality audio, and don’t try to get by with a Bluetooth headset that doesn’t faithfully recreate the type of sound quality you demand from your audio gear. You’re a music lover and it matters to you what your music sounds like.</p>
<p><b>PowerMuffs Have a Built-in, Noise-Canceling Microphone</b></p>
<p>When you’re listening to music, especially if the weather is less than perfect and you’re bundled up to listen in comfort, you don’t want to have to dig out your phone or take off your headset to take a call. With PowerMuffs, you don’t have to. With PowerMuffs, you can just use the headset’s built in noise-canceling microphone and volume controls to listen to your call, hold your conversation, and adjust the levels accordingly. No more tinny sound, and no more distorted Bluetooth conversations half-shouted to your family, friends, or business contacts. Now you can be as stylish and comfortable as you’ve always wanted to be while you enjoy great sound quality for both phone calls and music.</p>
<p><b>PowerMuffs Come Complete with a Battery and One-Year Warranty and Don’t Forget to Enjoy Six Hours of Music and Calls</b></p>Every set of PowerMuffs comes complete with a battery, unlike most other products out there. Buy with confidence knowing that our one-year warranty has your back. If you’re not happy, we’re not happy. PowerMuffs are a great product and we’ve spent a great deal of time, effort, and money developing them so that you’ll be satisfied. We wouldn’t bring PowerMuffs to market one minute before they were ready... and now, with your input and participation, we can finally bring PowerMuffs to market.

We live in a world where your personal sound is both more important and more accessible than ever before. Where once music lovers were content to wear low-fidelity, tinny headphones or, worse, stick annoying earbuds in their ears, those who prefer to have their lives continually scored may now choose from a plethora of high-quality, high-fidelity headphones that bring truly remarkable sound reproduction straight to their eardrums. There’s just one problem, however, with the current crop of great headphones out there.
No matter what product or product line you love, no matter what music company has your loyalty, no matter what style is your personal expression and choice, if you live somewhere that the weather is not picture perfect all year ‘round... you will eventually find that you can’t wear your beloved headphones and listen to the music you so dearly want to hear. That’s because when the weather turns cold, the average headphones simply can’t keep your ears warm while also delivering high quality sound. Heck, some of us just wear earmuffs as fashion statement!The solution is PowerMuffs, the warmest sound in the world. In anything but pleasant, sunny weather, standard headphones, even high-quality headphones that command premium prices, aren’t up to the task of keeping you wired for sound. PowerMuffs can deliver high-quality sound in even unpleasant weather. Whether it’s just a little chilly or it’s freezing outside, whether it’s raining lightly or snowing like mad, PowerMuffs protect your ears and keep them (and you) warm and comfortable... while also giving you the high-quality sound reproduction that lets you enjoy your music in premium fidelity.

Ashley / Founder & CEOMarketing & Fashion Expert

 Ashley grew up in the cold suburbs of Chicago, but quickly realized a love for warm sunny southern California. Traveling back to the cold to visit family meant having to deal with the same issues as everyone else living in the cold understands and that's enjoying music and talking on the phone while trying to stay warm. After a countless number of cold days and tangled headphone cords, she decided to amalgamate two great products into one. That's when she turned to her design and manufacturing skills to build a set of wireless earmuff headphones that kept her warm and entertained.    CONTACT USHave a question or comment about PowerMuffs?

True Wireless Earphones
The most secure wireless earphones ever. Easily and quickly molded by you to the exact shape of your ears creating a perfect fitting earphone that will never fall out or become uncomfortable. 

 
 
 
 
 

The Black Diamond earphones are the most secure true wireless earphones ever made. We want people to do whatever they choose without having to worry about their earphones falling out or becoming uncomfortable.
 
   Easily create perfect fitting custom molded earphones in minutes with our all-new Decibullz Press-Fit System. Simply heat the earpieces in hot water, snap in the earphones and press them into your ear. The earpieces will hold their shape until they are re-heated. The earpieces can be re-molded to make sure you get a perfect fit.
Decibullz makes the only re-moldable custom earphones and earplugs in the world. If you don't get the perfect fit the first time simply re-heat and re-shape! This can be done as many times as needed to get a perfect fit.   Decibullz has a track record of creating some of the best sounding earphones available. Our earphones have been recognized by some of the industry's toughest critics earning two CES Innovation Awards as well as Reviewed.com's Best Earphone of 2015. We are known for our well-balanced sound signature that is clean, powerful, and distortion free.
  The Black Diamond earphones feature a digital audio passthrough allowing you to hear external sounds when you want it and shut it out when you don't. Decibullz makes some of the best hearing protection so it's no surprise that our earphones do an amazing job of blocking out external noise.
  BLUETOOTH 5.0The Black Diamond earphones use the latest Bluetooth 5.0 technology designed specifically for true wireless audio and data. The means a stronger connection, 2X range, better audio quality, and 2X faster data transfer speeds
  Simply remove the earphones from the charging case and pair to your phone. Seriously, that's it! The earphones will then automatically sync to your phone everytime they are removed from the charging case.
  It's all about freedom. No more reaching to your device to adjust volume, control your music, make calls, or use voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, or Google.  
 We include everything you need to make the best fitting true wireless earphones with ease.What's In The Box

And we couldn’t find one that could fill an outdoor space with big, powerful sound. So we created the loudest Bluetooth speaker we could possibly fit in an 11.5” x 6.5” x 8.75” box of pure rugged tenacity. Turtlebox is LOUD and incredibly CLEAR.With a 50-watt internal amplifier, and an extremely efficient speaker and driver, Turtlebox will roar over anything without losing the subtle nuances in your music. You’ve never heard anything like this.Our optimized frequency curve makes sure you can hear every detail loud and clear as the sound cuts through wind and distance.Turn it up and unleash earth-shaking, glass-shattering distortion-free sound at up to 120dB! That’s louder than the cockpit of a fighter jet - all without losing sound quality! Every Turtlebox speaker can wirelessly pair up with another Turtlebox to give you legendary L/R true stereo sound.The first time we managed to pair two of our prototypes in stereo was an inspirational moment in our lives. We were instantly brought back to that common childhood memory of a first big rock concert.Most portables that pair together only do so in mono. Some brag that you can daisy-chain multiple units (more than 2 together) and that would somehow be awesome. What a waste.Turtlebox is different. It distinctly separates your left and right channels. This not only means you get double the sound power, but you get an incredibly realistic sound experience. You don’t want a daisy chain. You want real stereo sound. You want 2 boxes in stereo, well separated, and you want them loud.Turtlebox uses an advanced sound frequency curve that’s specifically designed to cut through wind and travel distance. This means your crystal-clear music will blast through raging storms and over hundreds of yards without a problem.One thing we’ve observed along the way is most other portables boast of “omnidirectional” sound (speaker placement on all sides of unit) and have touted its superiority. We’ve found that to be false in an outdoor environment. Half the sound generated by omnidirectional speakers is lost in the wind - all that audio power is wasted.You rarely put your sound source in the middle of the action - the reality is you put it to the side and fire it at the action. You want all of that power directed toward the listener.Not only is Turtlebox loud, it’s powerfully durable. Waterproof, dust-proof, and shockproof, Turtlebox can stand whatever abuse you throw at it.Toss it from your truck, wash it with a jet hose, or drop 100 brass bullet casings on it. Turtlebox can take a beating and keep playing.IP67 Water Ingress Protection Rating means Turtlebox is completely sealed from water and dust. You can throw Turtlebox in a pool, drop it in a lake, wash it off with a jet hose, and it’ll still play loud and clear.From the beginning, we took the road and the attitude that the housing is every bit as important in the outdoor experience as the electronics. All the housing we encountered were either too heavy or too light and used bad material choices.Yes, the box needs to be extremely tough. But the box should also be well-shaped, and not easily snagged. It shouldn’t hold water, anywhere. Mud and sand should hose right off.It needs to be well weighted - not too light, where it tips over with any movement, but not too heavy either. It needs a central center of gravity, where you can put it on its back the same as its feet.The box should be UV resistant and not fade in the sun. It needs to be slip resistant and have a grippy handle.And it should be built with very few pieces. Turtlebox hardware is made of stainless steel - making it not just strong but incredibly corrosion resistant. It’s able to handle saltwater, sand and whatever else nature has to offer.We use a 2 piece shell loaded with UV inhibitor that features non-slip rubber feet, a rubber handle, and a strong ABS skeleton.We took painstaking detail to perfect the look and strength of every piece in and out of Turtlebox. It can take a beating and still be ready for your next adventure.Turtlebox is approximately the size and shape of a classic lunchbox. We wanted the biggest speaker we could get with the lowest center of gravity, period.The size and weight ratio was strategically engineered to deliver excellent portability, without sacrificing substance.Too many portable speakers lack the size and weight required to deliver the full sound. When you pick up Turtlebox, you will immediately know you are holding something substantial.You are getting a big-magnet speaker - able to give you big sound - and you are getting a lightweight portable, able to bring on all your trips. Our 8 lb weigh-in is truly ideal.Need to strap Turtlebox down? No problem. We understand the need to have booming speakers strapped to the hood of your 4Wheeler - so we included built-in tie-down anchors on Turtlebox so you can strap it to virtually anything.Tie it to your canoe, ranger, airboat, bull, or whatever else you can think of. We designed it to fit any standard tie-down strap that you can buy from your local hardware store.Turtlebox boasts a 20+ hour long continuous playtime at 50% volume (still louder than many portables at max volume) with its rechargeable battery. We call this volume level “tailgate”. Everyone in a 50 person tailgate can hear it perfectly.We have had many max-volume longevity tests done, and honestly, it really depends on the music you test, but rock n’ roll routinely plays 6+ hours on our battery at an insanely loud max volume.Though the length varies depending on what you play, the 15,600 mAh/57.7 watt-hour built-in lithium ion 6-cell battery pack is a great capacity/weight choice and plays all day long when you need it to.Have you noticed how many portables need an instruction book? It’s crazy. Buttons all over the thing and even hidden buttons. We created the functionality of Turtlebox to be as simple as possible.The box is simple and straightforward. You will always be able to understand what the box is doing, and what state it is in. The buttons are all in one place. The panel is intuitive. And the Bluetooth pairing sequence is as easy as pushing a button.No fancy tricks, confusing buttons, or complicated screens. Our Bluetooth 4.0 connects automatically to your Bluetooth linked device up to 100 ft away.If you prefer the higher fidelity of an auxiliary input, you can bypass the Bluetooth connectivity by simply plugging in an aux cord to our classic 3.5mm input.LOUD, TOUGH, PORTABLE and EASY TO USE, what more can you ask for?We specifically designed and engineered Turtlebox to be the best outdoor speaker in the world. We did it.  We’re 4 best friends doing life together - canoeing the bayou, sailing in the bay, camping on the weekends.  We love music and high-quality gear. But when it came to a speaker that could keep up with our lifestyle - nothing got the job done.Portable Bluetooth speakers broke easily and weren’t nearly loud enough, while “outdoor” speakers were uber durable, but sounded terrible.

We spent over 10,000 grinding hours making sure every detail performed powerfully. We bought, sold, strained, pushed, stretched, dinked, and destroyed every portable speaker out there to make sure we could beat and exceed every single one outdoors.If we were going to make a portable speaker, we wanted it to be the best outdoor speaker modern-day technology could offer.  After years of working with engineers from all over the world, we finally crafted a speaker we’re proud of.LOUD, portable, waterproof and impact resistant, Turtlebox is the perfect speaker for all your life’s adventures.

<h3>The Mechanical Design</h3>
<p><strong>The Otto's DIY ecosystem</strong> was created for safe experimentation, easy and fast module prototyping. The printed circuit-boards are designed to fit common parts of synthesizers. The coordinates of the holes in the prototyping area are numbered along the edges of the panels to help the layout process. The pre-drilled holes make it easy to mount potentiometers and jack sockets even for relatively inexperienced craftsman. Just extend the size of the hole with a larger drill-bit and install any panel mount component.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517432154/lwttgzep70x0jpd30one.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

Introduction
The eurorack format is a mechanical and electrical standard for modular synthesizers. These synthesizers consists of eurorack modules, which are interconnected by patch cables. The modular concept allows you to build the functional blocks one by one, creating a synthesizer from ground zero.
Otto's DIY makes learning and experimenting easier and more accessible. Building eurorack modules is a great way to learn electronics, get creative and have fun. Whether you are expert or just starting off with synthesizers, Otto's DIY is here to take your eurorack experience to the next new level.
Otto's DIY Ecosystem

Otto's DIY Ecosystem consists of eurorack compatible prototyping printed circuit boards (PCBs), carefully chosen electrical components and mechanical parts.
The design allows you to build sandwich style skiff friendly modules, while the included set of hardware makes your build just as durable as any other factory made module.
The PowerBrick extension is responsible for powering your circuit while protecting the rest of your modular system.

Hardware pack 
The hardware package includes 10 mm standoffs, M2 bolts, nuts and a 16pin IDC busboard cable to power your module. The hardware pack is included free of charge in every perk.  (The amount of components vary with the number of PowerBricks in the perk.)

The Mechanical Design
The Otto's DIY ecosystem was created for safe experimentation, easy and fast module prototyping. The printed circuit-boards are designed to fit common parts of synthesizers. The coordinates of the holes in the prototyping area are numbered along the edges of the panels to help the layout process. The pre-drilled holes make it easy to mount potentiometers and jack sockets even for relatively inexperienced craftsman. Just extend the size of the hole with a larger drill-bit and install any panel mount component.

<h2>The Digital Earphone Evolution</h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">As
music continues to becoming more mobile and much more personal, we ask
ourselves how we can improve on earphone design for better enjoyment. HiFi
grade products utilize external USB DACs and headphone amplifiers to eliminate
the deficiency in the audio design of the mobile phone. We take this challenge
one step further by shrinking the implementation into a regular earphone. Z:ero
is the first digital earphone that includes a USB DAC and headphone amplifier
that you won’t even notice. It gets pure digital audio data from your mobile
USB port and creates High Fidelity music that everyone can afford and it’s
easily carried around. This isn’t just some marketing gimmick. Z:ero earphones
are truly digital.</span><br/></p>

</div><div>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>You must be kidding</h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">People
actually carry around bulky external USB DACs and amplifiers to improve the
audio quality and we were able to compact it and put it inside standard
earphones? Yes, we believed that High Fidelity earphone could be designed to be
more affordable and compact by carefully picking the right architecture and
components. We managed to put all components onto a tiny Printed Circuit Board
(PCB) that fits into Z:ero’s control box. Don’t be fooled by its size, it comes
with amazing results!</span><br/></p>

<h2>Why Digital Earphone?</h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">No
matter how good (or expensive) your existing earphone are, it is limited by the
DAC and amplifier design inside your mobile phone. Mobile phone designs are
highly dense and audio quality is always compromised for cost and size. By
getting the original audio data from the USB port directly, we free up the
bottleneck of processing the audio inside the phone. It’s like going from RCA
cables to HDMI in the TV evolution.</span><br/></p>

</div><h2><br/></h2><h2>The Earphone Driver</h2><div>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We
know how important the driver is in order to create really good music. Z:ero
digital earphones use neodymium magnets that can deliver high sensitivity SPL
(sound pressure level) in the 110-120dB range. This translate into quicker
response time and more vibrant audio .</span><br/>

<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>More Powerful</h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Due
to cost and size considerations, most mobile phones have very small audio
output power in the 12mW range. With the headphone amplifier built into
Z:ero, we increase the output power to 27mW. The bass quality sounds
revived and you’ll be surprised how much you have been missing out with your
old earphones.</span><br/></p>

earbud driver is housed in an aluminum casing with a gloss coating. We designed
Z:ero to come in red or gold so you can match it with your individual style.
The cables have been shielded preventing outside interference from rubbing or

covered with a matching color plate to unify the design pattern. </span><br/></p>

<p>     Please check <a href=""http://www.zorloo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.zorloo.com</a> FAQ on the latest compatibility list.</p>
<h4>Q. Any plans to extend to other smartphones?</h4>
<p>A.  Sure. We will continue testing additional smartphones that are commonly used         in the market.</p>
<h4>Q. Why do we expect compatibility issues with Z:ero?</h4>
<p>A.  First of all, smartphones should be ready for USB On-The-Go(OTG) functions             but most older versions of Android smartphone do not support OTG functions.</p>
<p>     Second, in the case of Android OS, there is not a standard that can be applied to        all devices like Apple's iOS since every brand has their own modifications that            are applied on top of the standard OS released from Google. This means testing        for every single Android smartphone must be tested to confirm compatibility.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Q. How do I pick earphone color or T-shirt size?</h4>
<p>A.  We will be sending out messages to our backers per perk that was selected                 requesting color and/or t-shirt size. We will also request address verification               before shipping out our products. </p>
<p></p>
<h4>Q. Does it work with other PC platforms like Windows, OS X and                Linux?</h4>A.  Yes, Z:ero is also tested to work at Windows 7, Windows 8.0/8.1, OS X Yosemite,       Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

</div></div>","The world’s smallest DAC + high-powered amplifier earphone designed to provide full digital audio without the need for an external device or bulky stereo headphone.





      The latest retail gift box version with bonus PC USB adapter included. 

The Digital Earphone Evolution
As
music continues to becoming more mobile and much more personal, we ask
ourselves how we can improve on earphone design for better enjoyment. HiFi
grade products utilize external USB DACs and headphone amplifiers to eliminate
the deficiency in the audio design of the mobile phone. We take this challenge
one step further by shrinking the implementation into a regular earphone. Z:ero
is the first digital earphone that includes a USB DAC and headphone amplifier
that you won’t even notice. It gets pure digital audio data from your mobile
USB port and creates High Fidelity music that everyone can afford and it’s
easily carried around. This isn’t just some marketing gimmick. Z:ero earphones
are truly digital.






You must be kidding
People
actually carry around bulky external USB DACs and amplifiers to improve the
audio quality and we were able to compact it and put it inside standard
earphones? Yes, we believed that High Fidelity earphone could be designed to be
more affordable and compact by carefully picking the right architecture and
components. We managed to put all components onto a tiny Printed Circuit Board
(PCB) that fits into Z:ero’s control box. Don’t be fooled by its size, it comes
with amazing results!





Why Digital Earphone?
No
matter how good (or expensive) your existing earphone are, it is limited by the
DAC and amplifier design inside your mobile phone. Mobile phone designs are
highly dense and audio quality is always compromised for cost and size. By
getting the original audio data from the USB port directly, we free up the
bottleneck of processing the audio inside the phone. It’s like going from RCA
cables to HDMI in the TV evolution.










The Earphone Driver
We
know how important the driver is in order to create really good music. Z:ero
digital earphones use neodymium magnets that can deliver high sensitivity SPL
(sound pressure level) in the 110-120dB range. This translate into quicker
response time and more vibrant audio .






More Powerful
Due
to cost and size considerations, most mobile phones have very small audio
output power in the 12mW range. With the headphone amplifier built into
Z:ero, we increase the output power to 27mW. The bass quality sounds
revived and you’ll be surprised how much you have been missing out with your
old earphones.





Vivid Design Pattern
The
earbud driver is housed in an aluminum casing with a gloss coating. We designed
Z:ero to come in red or gold so you can match it with your individual style.
The cables have been shielded preventing outside interference from rubbing or
scratching and coated in a red/silver stripe pattern. The control box is
covered with a matching color plate to unify the design pattern. 




Carrying Case
To keep your earphones safe and clean, we also provide a free carrying case. The Z:ero red version comes with a purple carrying case and the Z:ero gold version comes with a black carrying case.

Here is what we decided:</span></p></figure></div><p><b>Stretch goal #1 - Hacking Guide 130.000 EUR</b><br/>The second most requested thing was a hacking guide. We already created a draft for a visual guide which will explain you the foundations of how to use the automat toolkit. As part of the stretch goal we will create a series of tutorials for our backers, too. </p><p><b>Stretch goal #2 - Community - 160.000 EUR</b><br/>Besides just having a piece of paper or video to explain things, we believe there has to be a central platform for the future of music making with machines / dadamachines. So I want to open and run a community platform based on discourse - like the guys from <a href=""http://community.axoloti.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">axoloti</a>, <a href=""http://llllllll.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">monome</a> and <a href=""https://www.elektronauts.com/latest"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">elektron</a> run it for their communities It’ll be a platform where you can share new designs for adapters and elements, code or circuit designs and much more.</p><p><b>Stretch goal #3 - Configuration Tool / Velocity - 177.777 EUR [adjusted]</b><br/>So far the most-requested feature has been velocity. What exactly does that mean? For people not as familiar with MIDI, the velocity value essentially maps to how strong the solenoid movement is when it hits something. This means that if you have variable velocity then you have more variety in the sound you output. This variety can offer more expressive and less mechanical noise making - and as music makers that’s pretty cool.</p><p>Currently, the toolkit allows changing the dynamic by changing the length of the note you are sending via MIDI which aleady offers a lot of possibilites. In order to give you guys even more control, we will create a configuration tool if we reach 190K EUR. This tool will allow you to customize the MIDI velocity values - meaning you can change the latency thereby ‘tuning’ the instruments you build. We are excited because we expect people can find cool ways to use velocity if they hooks up LED lights or DC motors as well. We will also make sure the tool includes the option to save favorite settings as presets.</p><p>Our friend Tobias who runs <a href=""https://tubbutec.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tubbutec</a> made a similar tool for his product called <a href=""https://tubbutec.de/unipulse/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">unipulse</a>, from which we will draw inspiration for the dadamachines configuration tool:</p><div data-id=""16156452""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""example config tool - Tubbutec uniPulse Configurator"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1493047801/bd3pu3e3327elx6zdsew.png"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>example config tool - Tubbutec uniPulse Configurator</figcaption></figure></div><p>We have discussed this with several experts and are confident that we can build this solution given the constraints of the campaign funding.

<p>dadamachines is the project of Berlin-based Creative Technologist and DJ – Johannes Lohbihler. Johannes grew up in Bavaria, hailing from a line of seven generations of carpenters. Growing up among the Weilheim music scene that included producers and bands such like the Notwist, Lali Puna and Acid Pauli - Johannes was interested in music from early on. He started DJing and found inspiration to bring together the world of electronic music and analog tools - combining his background as a craftsman and love of music. </p></figure></div>

<p>During his masters studies in product and interaction design, he began building tangible musical instruments which eventually led to dadamachines. Given the complicated nature of most automata and music machines, Johannes began developing the automat toolkit, a simple plug-and-play kit that made music machines available to everyone. </p>

</div></div>","Press Kit | Facebook | Instagram | Twitter | Web  The automat toolkit is a plug & play MIDI-controller and accessories kit that allows anyone to build awesome music machines using the real world as their instrument.  click for high resolution image
 
“I also feel like there’s a new genre of music to be mined here. I’m calling it tinkertechno.” – Donald Bell I Make Magazine   The center of each toolkit is the automat controller. Plug in your favorite software or hardware MIDI input directly into the controller. For output, automat controller has 12 universal DC outputs to connect motors, solenoids, LEDs - whatever you want to start playing. No coding or soldering required!click for high resolution image
 ""The whole box reminds me of the first analog and MIDI connections for studio equipment. It has that same musician-friendly look – and feels like something that could really open up the way you work."" – Peter Kirn I cdm  
The automat is plug & play – offering unlimited possibilities. Simply connect your favorite MIDI hardware device, music App or DAW and trigger the actuators of your choice to create a composition.  Never played an instrument? Not a problem! Today’s music apps make it easy to get started. Back in November 2014, Johannes held a workshop with friends in Lund, Sweden. This very special evening provided the motivation to build the dadamachines project after seeing non-musician friends get excited and experimenting with sound.  Ready to get hands-on and explore your ideas? Digital tools enable you to be precise and fast about trying new things. Combine anything with the automat toolkit and start creating your own sound.Taison is an old friend of Johannes and composes for theatre productions such as ""20.000 Meilen unter den Meeren"". This production became the original testing ground for the toolkit development.

 
In early 2016, Johannes was approached by BLACKSPACE to develop an installation with them for AUDI called the MUSIC BOX that has since played 50+ live sets.   ""automat is an innovative, hackable controller that turns MIDI signals into mechanical impulses and can be used to make musical instruments out of just about anything. Bring on the music robots!"" – Rounik Sethi I ask.audio
 





 
mobile music making Use one of many awesome music making apps available for iPhone or iPad. your production environment Integrate the toolkit into your studio workflow and with the DAW of your choice. your hardware setup You can also connect to your favorite MIDI hardware including keyboards, sequencers, drum machines and synth to play them alongside the toolkit.  your custom projectsHack your automat and use it with Firmata and the Ableton connection kit, Pure Data or MaxMSP. Connect your own circuits, extensions, sensors or shields or code your own software with Arduino.  
Get creative, and use many different actuators on one of the 12 universal DC outputs. [ 12-24V depending on your power supply - max 1.3A per channel ] You can do really cool stuff having a simple timeline based interface to control actions, not only to make music.

It keeps the volume at a safe level that will not result in permanent hearing loss.  


How does Sounds85 work? It is simple to use and unobtrusive. The Sounds85 attaches to all earbuds, headphones or music/video players, and limits the volume to approximately 85 decibels - no matter how loud the volume on the device.  The proprietary design ensures that it does not denigrate the quality of the sound - keeping your music or video sound effects as they were meant to be heard. It can be used
with all audio devices, such as iPhones, Androids, iPads, MP3 players, and tablets, keeping the
volume at a safe level. Sounds85 is not a permanent installation. It can be attached and removed from headphones, earbuds and music/video players.                                                   
                                    How Loud is Too Loud?  
The National Institute of Occupation Safety and Health
(NIOSH) states that a person can listen to any noise at 85 decibels for up to 8
hours without suffering a permanent hearing loss. As soon as the noise is increased only 3 decibels, the amount of
time a person can listen without permanent hearing loss is cut in half…only 4 hours!

                          Will your kids have Hearing Loss by age 20?

 A recent study
concluded loud music delivered through headphones or earbuds promotes potential hearing
loss. This survey carried out by a 3rd party for Siemens asked 500 teens if
they had experienced ringing, roaring, buzzing, or pain in their ears – nearly HALF
- 46% - said “Yes”!  This is a significant increase over a similar study done
about 4 yrs ago showing only 20% of teens indicated possible hearing loss.
We protect
our children’s skin from the sun, our children’s heads and knees when on bikes,
and we limit what our children watch on TV. Let’s get a Sounds85 on all children’s
listening devices and protect the only set of ears they will ever have!     


Look at these Hearing Loss Facts:

Permanent Hearing Loss cannot be fixed or reversed!
46% of teens in a recent study admitted to having roaring, buzzing, or pain in their ears...signs of permanent hearing loss!
There are almost as many 30-somethings with loud music induced hearing loss as there are 70 year olds with age-related hearing loss.
Music induced hearing loss is often accompanied by tinnitus (ringing in the ears).
The output from headphones and earbuds can be greater than 110 decibels (this is like the sound of a chainsaw with no protection).
Listening to 100 decibels will start to cause permanent hearing loss and often times tinnitus after only 15 minutes of listening time (National Institute of Safety and Health – NIOSH)

Great article written about Sounds85 in the 
Denver Posthttp://www.denverpost.com/Lifestyle/ci_25778909...
Is There an App for
Limiting the Volume Output?Sounds85
is a Simple Low Tech Solution to a High Tech Problem: Music Induced Hearing Loss! Most  music, movie, or game players do not have an app to control the maximum output.
Some of the new devices have a way to lower the max output . . .  BUT, YOU MUST GUESS
AT WHERE YOU ARE SETTING IT. Too low you get justified complaints. Too high and
you are still at risk of permanent hearing loss. Guessing at the setting is like putting your car's cruise control on
without a speedometer reading!  
There is NO APP that controls the max volume for all music, movies and games. With the Sounds85 there is no guessing. It automatically sets the max output to approximately 85dB.       
 

Who should order a Sounds85?

Anyone who does not want to experience hearing loss from loud headphones and earbuds.

Businesses whose employees use
headphones and earbuds at work.


Schools should place them on all
computers where students use headphones and earbuds.


Parents for their children – start
them young. They will think this is part of how we listen to anything with
headphones and earbuds . . . just like kids think ""you should always put a seat belt on when
riding in a car"".

Parents for their teenagers –
remind them it’s not cool to struggle to hear, especially when they caused the loss themselves.

Who designed Sounds85?

                                                     


Jeff
Baron, AuD, has been an audiologist for over 22 years. He designed and tested
the Sounds85, and is the CEO of Sounds85, LLC, a Boulder, Colorado based
company. His primary focus is now the prevention of hearing loss for people of
all ages, especially those that use headphones and earbuds.  He spent years researching,
designing, and developing the Sounds85  Personal Volume Protector. He worked with an audio engineer, a
doctor of education, and incorporated research by doctors of audiology and
high-tech manufacturing experts.  Since billions of earbuds and headphones were already in use, he
wanted to develop a product that could be used with any existing headphone or
earbud.





                                    
                  

Celebrities who have publicly come out to say they have
Noise Induced Hearing Loss and some also have Tinnitus (ringing
in the ears):



Chris Martin (Cold Play’s lead
singer)


Pete Townsend (The Who)


Will.I.Am (Rapper – Black Eyed
Peas)

Bill Clinton
Whoopi Goldberg
Phil Collins
Eric Clapton
How Will Your Funds will be Used?
1.
Manufacturing and delivering devices to all of our generous backers.
2. Expand
our education and marketing campaigns by using a variety of social networking
(Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus) to promote a greater understanding of the
problem of music-induced hearing loss.
3. Travel
to national conferences to make presentations, allow reviewers hand-on
experience with the Sounds85 and to interact with potential customers and
distributors.
4. For
research and development of products to help prevent music-induced hearing
loss.
5. Explore
collaborations with high-profile musicians and other people of influence who have
credibility with large audiences of young people who are at high risk for
hearing loss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Where are we in the manufacturing, distribution, and information dissemination process?1. We completed our first small manufacturing run, tweaked a few minor issues pointed out by our beta-testers and incorporated those changes into our design. You will be receiving our finished product – not a prototype.2. We currently have 100 units in use and ordered a second, larger manufacturing run so that our backers will receive their orders soon after the Indiegogo campaign is completed.3. Two articles were written in local newspapers about music -induced hearing loss and Sounds85. We are diligently working with a very talented marketing expert (who is currently donating her time because she believes in our product) to spread the word through blogs, newspapers, and social media.What are the Risks and Challenges?Risks: Challenges: Our biggest challenge is to educate the public about the severe consequences of listening to loud music under headphones or earbuds.  Educating a high tech population that they need to use a low tech accessory to prevent this type of hearing lossOne of our early beta-testers described the problem of music induced hearing loss as a “latent pain”. He said ""By the time you realize that you need to do something about it, the damage is already done.”",22.0,3,"1 Campaign

Experience music like you're there. Bring sound to the next level. Engineered in every detail, they feature: ✅ Weighs Only 23g✅ Real Hi-Fi Sound with Double CS43198 DAC Chips✅ THD: 0.0008% / SNR: 122dB✅ 2.5mm Balanced Output; Output Level: 2.0V✅ 3.5mm Audio Output; Output Level: 2.1V✅ Battery-free & Ultra-low Power Consumption Design✅ Quite a Simple Plug and Play✅ Supports All Android, iOS and PC devices (even if the device with the case)✅ Supports For Using While Charging    When buying a smartphone nowadays, most people expect it to do everything correctly. One of the biggest complaints of users is the fact that most smartphones have limited performance DAC chips, and audiophiles have to resort to other, more expensive solutions to get the sound they want. That's when we decided to set a new standard in the portable AMP market, developing the most thoroughly designed product, premium in every detail, at an affordable price. Borrowing from our successful experience in creating OH1, OH10, and similar USB-type AMP - Zerda, we integrated more professional technology and MasterHIFI series chips into our Music Patch. Yes, it came; it came with incredible super functions.     Initially, we analyzed the market to isolate the features that users cared about the most. We identified the nine main factors and their solutions.   
DAC Performance
Input and Output Jacks
Easy Control
Sound Quality
Practical Convenience
Portability
Compatibility
No Frequent Charging
Cheaper and Better
 Once we made sure we could fit every feature in such a small budget, we set out to find the best suppliers for each component. We then focused on creating a team of developers composed of the most experienced engineers in the fields of core technology, audio quality, and portable exterior. We have designed the new standard of portable DAC, the following table speaks for itself:   Here are some of the DAC chips on the market:    What immediately sets cheap AMP apart from premium ones is the quality of the audio. Thanks to the Cirrus MasterHIFI CS43198 chips support, ITM05 Music Patch delivers precision-tuned sound. It is a next-generation, low power audio DAC that provides a superior system-level audio performance without draining battery life. Our high-quality chips provide for a full-range listening experience, satisfying even at lower volumes. ITM05 Music Patch’s distortion rate of under 0.0008% will give you the listening needed for an immerse and seamless audio delivery.    What the Music Patch does is connect to your phone’s or computer’s USB or lightning port and convert the digital signal to analog. Also, it has two audio out ports, one 3.5mm, and one 2.5mm so that you can connect your headphones or other equipment. It's worth mentioning that, ITM05’s maximum audio sample rate is PCM 32bit/384Khz; DSD256 (Supports the highest specifications for iPhone devices). The quality of the sound effect is similar to the monitor; the sample rate is like the resolution; the higher the value, the clearer the effect. So the music presented by an excellent audio player like our ITM05 is also more colorful.  Even better than other AMP products, ITM05 Music Patch directly supports Lightning and Type-C input, meaning that even if you're playing games or listening to music while you're interfacing ITM05, it doesn't interfere with your normal use.   This isn’t an easy market to compete in as portable DACs and AMPs market has been growing in recent years, but the ITM05 looks to be the smallest one yet. It weighs only 23 grams (comparable to a AAA battery) and features both USB-C and Lightning support. Besides, battery-free and low power consumption design help eliminate unwanted burdens and allow you to quite a simple plug and play.  The plug of ITM05 has a retractable strap, so even if your phone has a case, it fits perfectly.  Our ITM05 equipped with five pieces of adhesive strips(three are nano-silica strips, two are nanosponge strips), which can be easily glued to the surface of your phone without loosening, regardless of whether made of plastic or glass. It also is very convenient to remove. Just plug it into your phone, you can use it at once. It applies to plastic, glass, silica gel, leather, PU, metal, glass, and other smooth surfaces, etc.   Stop fretting about the unsatisfactory sound quality of your electronics, and don't need to buy extra expensive audio products to go with it. Just plug it in, and ITM05 Music Patch instantly upgrades your smartphones or computer to a perfect HiFi audio system. Also, the Music Patch can support the Android version of quick charge, do not support Apple's quick charge temporarily. Even though this is our first crowdfunding campaign, but before that, we had designed and produced IKKO OH1, IKKO OH10, and IKKO Zerda, all of which were well received by HiFi enthusiasts around the world. We are confident we will be able to deliver a great product and without delays. Here are some feedbacks from our previous customers:   Because of our professional attitude and rich product experience, we are trusted by many partners in the industry, so this time, IKKO still strives to make the best products and services.      We get a lot of inquiries from customers about how high the ITM05 can bring sound quality up to. Using the iPhone X as an example, we measured the output effect before and after using ITM05.  Using ITM05 increases the output of the phone to nearly 100%!   Want more incredible sound quality? Pair our OH1(worth $139) or OH10(worth $189) with ITM05 Music Patch. From this, there is no end to sound quality upgrading!     Tips On How To Clean Sticky Strips:  (Remember not to immerse the product directly in water, because the product itself is not waterproof).  Get free upgrades only by sharing ITM05 Music Patch with your friends! With just one referral, you will get an open high-end storage box! With five referrals, you will get a free IKKO OH10 IEMs!

<p>When streaming services took over, a lot of people stopped paying attention to sound quality. You listened through your earbuds, your laptop, your smartphone. Or you connected to a music player through bluetooth and everything sounded a little better — as long as you stayed within 30 feet, and Mom didn’t call.</p>
<h1>It’s time for your music player to do the heavy lifting</h1>
<p>Solo is a beautiful, compact hardwood box that delivers big, room-filling audio with no smart device required. It's a simple, all-in-one solution to streaming music.</p>

</div>","HiFi Multi-Room streaming from Audio Hall of Fame member Tom DeVesto, the founder of Cambridge SoundWorks & Tivoli Audio.      



No cellphone necessary!
Two music systems - Solo and Duetto. High quality sound and build, simplicity of use, and an unprecedented number of music listening options available at the touch of a button.



Solo system in walnut


When streaming services took over, a lot of people stopped paying attention to sound quality. You listened through your earbuds, your laptop, your smartphone. Or you connected to a music player through bluetooth and everything sounded a little better — as long as you stayed within 30 feet, and Mom didn’t call.
It’s time for your music player to do the heavy lifting
Solo is a beautiful, compact hardwood box that delivers big, room-filling audio with no smart device required. It's a simple, all-in-one solution to streaming music.



Solo measures 5” H x 9.5” W x 4.7” D. Shown in hand-painted high gloss (white)


Double your power with Duetto
Pledge $275 or more, and you’ll unlock even more sound with Duetto. Duetto takes all the exciting features Solo has to offer, with true stereo sound, to allow for much higher listening levels.



Duetto measures 5.3"" H x 14.5"" W x 5.6"" D; Shown in hickory


Endless ways to listen
When you stream music straight off your Solo or Duetto, your phone stays free to do everything else. Never waste your phone's battery with streaming again.

Air is the first acoustic device in the world to implement carbon nanotube technology. This is a major industry breakthrough that will allow Air to have a comfortable, ergonomic design while looking, feeling and, most importantly, sounding spectacular.We’ve spent thousands of hours working with world-class acoustic labs and audio engineers to develop the very best wireless headphones - Air has been built with a 5.2 mm customized speaker driver, and utilizes a cutting-edge Carbon Nanotube diaphragm and the latest CSR chip. These features unite to deliver a design that immerses you in your music, the way it was meant to sound.To guarantee a secure, comfortable fit for every user, we scanned and analyzed hundreds of ears. Then created a variety of size combinations to fit them.  Additionally, we created three “Sport Sleeves” for using with strenuous exercise - made with medical-grade silicone, these sleeves are ultra-light and skin-friendly.In contrast to other wireless headphones, Air is designed to fit ergonomically, without adding pressure to the conch and ear canal areas.Air has what it takes to follow you through even your most eventful days, providing the soundtrack to your daily life. Air comes in two color combinations: crisp White/Blue or elegant Black/RedSimply pair with your Amazon Dot to talk to Alexa, no matter where you are.With a water-resistant rating of IPX6, Air will always be ready for the unexpected - whether you’re training for a marathon or shredding a double black diamond.We've improved upon our own high standards of acoustic performance. Our team has worked tirelessly to guarantee high-quality sound clarity - unparalleled at this tiny size.We passionately designed a larger-than-life acoustic system by utilizing a carbon nanotube diaphragm. As a result of this design, the speaker driver is compact and durable, with the ability to deliver ultra-fast responses for elegant, sophisticated sound.In addition to utilizing cutting-edge carbon nanotechnology, we customized the 5.2mm speaker driver using industry-leading model analysis, fine-tuning and adjusting the positioning and size of every element in the speaker chamber.crazybaby’s acoustic team is led by the electroacoustic legend, Dr. Yu, an extraordinary industry leader whose professional life has been devoted to creating innovative audio solutions. Under the direction of Dr. Yu, our acoustic team spent countless hours determining the perfect size, height and angle for each electroacoustic element.To create Air we partnered with Tsinghua University and Foxconn Associate Labs.  They’ve spent nine years researching and developing advanced carbon nanotechnology (CNT). All CNT diaphragms located inside of Air headphones are made individually, instead of being mass-produced, so as to ensure each one independently meets the strict quality standards set forth by the Lab.CVC 8TH Noise Isolation Technology ＋ Air's double digital silicon microphone work together to maintain call quality by efficiently mitigating background noise.​Air uses Bluetooth 4.2 (the newest bluetooth technology) to ensure crystal-clear stereo sound while paired with your device.Compared to its predecessor, this new Bluetooth protocol increases data transmission speed by 2.5x, data volume by 10x and for the first time ever, connects over IPV6 to decrease energy consumption and provide safer internet access.In a world flooded with Bluetooth technology, Air is a cut above the rest. By including the latest embedded TWS (True Wireless Stereo) chipset, Air delivers high-performance sound without additional bulk.The free iOS and Android apps will get your listening started in a beat, and allow you to customize your EQ to hear exactly what you're looking for.  SoundDriver Diaphragm: 998 Carbon NanotubeDriver Unit: 0.20” (5.2 mm) Custom-made Hi-Fidelity MicroDriversAcoustic Architecture: ClosedMagnet Type: NeodymiumFrequency Response: 8Hz to24kHzImpedance: 16 OhmsSensitivity: 101dB SPL/1mWMax.

To create a fabric that is safe and durable (even for use in extreme sports), we utilized an innovative material, called Fit-Tex™. Air Leash’s flexible, tear-free fabric meets the Oeko-Tex Standard 100, is REACH SVHC-free and exceeds environmental protection regulations in America, Europe, Japan, etc. The manufacturer we used when producing the Air Leash is equally advanced, and regularly works with brands such as Louis-Vuitton, Victoria’s Secret, etc.The Air Leash is virtually weightless, convenient to bring wherever you need. While Air itself has a secure fit that works with all ear sizes, the Air Leash is an additional safeguard for when you need it most - whether you’re hitting the slopes or running a marathon.We aim to make products that honor every moment, and provide a revolutionary audio experience to every customer.We knew we wanted to come back to Indiegogo because of the outpouring of support we felt from the community the first time we released a product (Mars Levitating Speaker). Now that we have a new product to show the world, we couldn’t resist the chance to reward old (and new) Indiegogo backers with discounted products.Additionally, when we launch a new product with crowdfunding, every step of our progress is inseparable from your support - this motivates us to do right by all of our backers and provide you with the best possible product we can. Wherever we go, our plan is clear: think outside the box to create innovations that benefit the world.Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who needs this!We can't do this without you.

The sound system is created on the same advanced amplifier as the award-winning Lemus HOME Classic, giving you the same 300-watt power, usability and world-class features.The sound system consists of an extremely powerful subwoofer with an 8"" long-stroke woofer, which the amplifier exploits beyond its normal limit for a revolutionary deep bass. In addition, 2x high-end full-range units deliver the crystal-clear mid and high tones, which together with the bass, are designed to create a perfectly balanced transition through the advanced built-in Quad-Core DSP.    We know how to make good sound and great design   For our award winning Lemus HOME-collection  All taxes are included.     Designed, Developed and Produced in DenmarkPremium Danish craftsmanship and FSC certified wood (wood from sustainable resources) guarantee a piece of furniture that will pleasantly surprise you in every aspect. With a height of only 18.5 cm (7,28"") and a depth of 35 cm (13,89""), and a choice between white and black with black fabric front, the Lemus HOME Piano is created to blend perfectly into your home interior.  Say goodbye to messy connections and cable clutter   Outstanding film and music soundThe Lemus HOME Piano is not like other soundbars.

That’s not cool. You constantly have to unplug and replug earplugs, for a situation where sound levels are lower, or you need to communicate with your friends. Also with their design focused on hiding the plugs, they communicate that you do not want to show these products to your surrounding. Rightfully so because well, they’re ugly. Electronic hearables can provide a more better solution, however, they do not provide protection. And that sucks. Also, because the sound goes in and out electronically, you will not hear the real sound. The sound is altered and there is a slight lag. They’re also pretty pricey because of all the electronic stuff. And although these products provide better aesthetics compared to ear plugs, we believe they still don’t look good enough to enhance the user's style.

<i>Okay. We’re ready to meet the team now. </i><br/>Prepare to meet seven ambitious and skilled people then. Knops is founded by Koen, Quinten, Arjen and Richard. Koen and Quinten already have a thriving business selling earplugs with their company called Thunderplugs. Their earplugs are sold in a whopping 26 countries worldwide. They’re like the Richard Bransons of earplugs. Sort of. Their experience in the music business including worldwide shipping is something we use to our advantage for Knops. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The other two founders are the brothers Arjen and Richard. Arjen has a Ph.D. in acoustics and is a leading engineer. He has worked for clients like NASA, Porsche, and Ferrari. He’s basically a rocket scientist with an acoustic guitar. Or something like that. The idea for Knops conceived by Arjen is also engineered by Arjen in co-operation with Richard. Richard has a master of arts and is a world class designer. He has worked with clients like IKEA and NASA. He once built a rocket named Sven. We think. The revolutionary design for Knops is created by Richard. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The team is completed by Raoul, Floris, Joren, and Nora. Raoul is responsible for Online Project Management and Marketing. He’s our digital ninja d’extraordinaire. Floris is our financial and online marketing mastermind. Basically a calculator with a Google Adwords-account. Joren and Nora are responsible for graphic design, supported by creative agency Today. Jony Ive called them once. They didn’t answer.</div>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>We have already completed most of the design and engineering for Knops and have fully working prototypes which we have tested with close partners, friends, colleagues, and a large number of independent testers.</p>
<p>Even though we have extensively tested our prototypes, Knops is a completely new product and as with any product manufactured for the first time, there is a possibility that unforeseen bugs, challenges, and delays will occur. We will do our utmost best to deliver the perfect product.</p>
<p>The decibel levels are indicative. We have good results with the acoustic tests of our prototypes, however the final product decibel levels may differ slightly from these indications. We will use independent test centers to qualify the official attenuation level according to norms. </p>
<p>We have identified our suppliers and have already started planning production timelines and processes. Moreover, through the execution success that we've had with Thunderplugs, we have proven our ability to deliver hundreds of thousands of great quality products in short timeframes. We also have our manufacturer in the Netherlands which gives us the possibility to act fast.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on relentless execution. Even after this Indiegogo Indemand campaign ends, we plan to send out continuous updates and announcements regarding Knops (and beyond!).</p>

There a group of creative friends came together to explore a solution for our hearing.We collectively decided that hearing protection devices and electronic hearables did not provide a good enough solution for our ears. And, like we mentioned earlier, they were pretty ugly.We discovered that earplugs are lowering sound all the time, most of the time with worse quality than our own natural hearing. That’s not cool. You constantly have to unplug and replug earplugs, for a situation where sound levels are lower, or you need to communicate with your friends. Also with their design focused on hiding the plugs, they communicate that you do not want to show these products to your surrounding. Rightfully so because well, they’re ugly. Electronic hearables can provide a more better solution, however, they do not provide protection. And that sucks. Also, because the sound goes in and out electronically, you will not hear the real sound. The sound is altered and there is a slight lag. They’re also pretty pricey because of all the electronic stuff. And although these products provide better aesthetics compared to ear plugs, we believe they still don’t look good enough to enhance the user's style. Read: They’re ugly.But it’s not all about the noise. It’s also about the lack of noise. We are constantly surrounded by noise. And we are constantly distracted. With Knops you are in control of the amount of volume you want to receive. You can eliminate noise entirely if you like. Enjoying the absence of crying babies and whining ex-lovers. Ain’t that a blessing? After a lot of research with focus on the user experience, we created the Knops concept. A volume button, which is adaptable to every situation, protects your ears against damage, filters noise to your liking, and also looks super good. We used a design method where we iteratively created prototypes and directly tested these with actual users in real life so we could use their  feedback. This way, we involved the user from the start. We perfected the ergonomics, so you can wear Knops all day with maximum comfort. We made the turning knob work smoothly with great haptic feedback while turning.With the help of computer simulations and real-world prototypes tested in our acoustic labs, we tuned the Knops prototypes. We spend a lot of time acoustically fine tuning the sound, so we can provide the best quality filtering at every volume level.     

Okay. We’re ready to meet the team now. Prepare to meet seven ambitious and skilled people then. Knops is founded by Koen, Quinten, Arjen and Richard. Koen and Quinten already have a thriving business selling earplugs with their company called Thunderplugs. Their earplugs are sold in a whopping 26 countries worldwide. They’re like the Richard Bransons of earplugs. Sort of. Their experience in the music business including worldwide shipping is something we use to our advantage for Knops. 
 
The other two founders are the brothers Arjen and Richard. Arjen has a Ph.D. in acoustics and is a leading engineer. He has worked for clients like NASA, Porsche, and Ferrari. He’s basically a rocket scientist with an acoustic guitar. Or something like that. The idea for Knops conceived by Arjen is also engineered by Arjen in co-operation with Richard. Richard has a master of arts and is a world class designer. He has worked with clients like IKEA and NASA. He once built a rocket named Sven. We think. The revolutionary design for Knops is created by Richard. 
 
The team is completed by Raoul, Floris, Joren, and Nora. Raoul is responsible for Online Project Management and Marketing. He’s our digital ninja d’extraordinaire. Floris is our financial and online marketing mastermind. Basically a calculator with a Google Adwords-account. Joren and Nora are responsible for graphic design, supported by creative agency Today. Jony Ive called them once. They didn’t answer.
 


 
Risks and challenges
We have already completed most of the design and engineering for Knops and have fully working prototypes which we have tested with close partners, friends, colleagues, and a large number of independent testers.
Even though we have extensively tested our prototypes, Knops is a completely new product and as with any product manufactured for the first time, there is a possibility that unforeseen bugs, challenges, and delays will occur. We will do our utmost best to deliver the perfect product.
The decibel levels are indicative. We have good results with the acoustic tests of our prototypes, however the final product decibel levels may differ slightly from these indications. We will use independent test centers to qualify the official attenuation level according to norms. 
We have identified our suppliers and have already started planning production timelines and processes. Moreover, through the execution success that we've had with Thunderplugs, we have proven our ability to deliver hundreds of thousands of great quality products in short timeframes. We also have our manufacturer in the Netherlands which gives us the possibility to act fast.
We pride ourselves on relentless execution. Even after this Indiegogo Indemand campaign ends, we plan to send out continuous updates and announcements regarding Knops (and beyond!).

<p>For example, if the pet needs to go outside to “go potty,” the pet traditionally will go to the door and wait for its owner to let it out.

<p>Our break-through system builds off of the already established behavior of the pet standing next to the door when it is ready to “go potty” OR standing next to the door when the pet is ""ready to come inside"" the home or dwelling.

The FOXILON P45 is a compact solar powered Bluetooth speaker produced from high end materials, delivering quality audio, powerfull power bank function and a build-in lamp.
After a successful market introduction of the first portable fully solar powered Bluetooth speaker, the FOXILON P23, we decided to upscale the concept with additional features to provide a more immerse sound experience and extended portable features.
The ideal travel companion
Designed for people who love to travel and want to move independent from power outlets. The P45 has been optimized to offer maximum sound and powerbank performance in an easy-to-carry size and convenient shape. Easily fits any suitcase, purse, backpack or even the inner pocket of your coat. The included strap and 1/4"" adaptor allows for multifunctional fixation possibilities.
Take the P45 on outdoor adventures to enjoy your favorite music during a hike, camping, cycling or other activities. The two solar panels will charge the powerbanks, even in indirect sunlight, while you are on the go. Free, green energy, while enjoying the nature.

Quality
Hand-build and assembled in The Netherlands to ensure an unrivaled quality.
The P45 aircraft grade CNC machined aluminum unibody can take a punch and with it's IP65 rating it is made for outdoor use.
The sunk control buttons are made from solid stainless steel, by CNC turning process, and sealed with rubber o-rings in order to prevent water ingress and guarantee durability.
Built to endure. Sustainable from the core.

Sound
The acoustic components are designed to reach the best sound experience possible for a highly portable speaker that easily fits in your jacket.
Two full range drivers, supported by a passive bass radiator, make for a balanced sound at low, middle and high frequencies. The Bluetooth 4.1 receiver with  apt X® support and DSP support high resolution streaming. The full range drivers are custom designed for the high efficiency requirements and powered by two separate and extremely efficient class G amplifiers with a total of 12 Watt. The perfect balance between power and efficiency.

 
Solar Panel Powerbank
Due to the dual parallel linked amorphous solar panels the P45 charges itself in nearly every situation where light is present. A wall charger is not necessary anymore! The custom designed solar panels and circuitry provide a charge to the speaker battery even without direct sunlight. The build in 6400 mAh battery provides approximately 100 hours of music playtime on a full battery. The P45 also has a regular USB-A socket that can be used to charge external devices. When on the go you can plug your smartphone, e-reader or tablet in the speaker and it will charge your device. The build in battery and charge circuit is capable to charge an average smartphone 2-3 times. Simultaneous music playback and device charging is possible.
With the P45 it's possible to use solar power to charge your life.
Operation
FOXILON products are design for intuitive operation. The P45 has only 2 control buttons.

By operating the upper button the speaker can be turned on and off. When the button is depressed, the battery indicator automatically shows the current battery lever by lighting up the four led's that are positioned along the port cover. During audio playback the button acts as a play/pause button (on compatible Apps).
By operating the lower button the mood lamp can be switched On or Off.

<p><span><em> </em></span></p>
<h2><span>Full Description:</span></h2>
<p>vcNOIZ is a gritty sounding voltage controlled noise source. <strong>The best way to imagine it is as a noise VCO.</strong> The frequency of the noise is both linearly and exponentially controllable by analogue control voltage signals. It creates positively raunchy C64-esque digital noise and sounds great for hihats and other sounds as well!</p>
<p>By patching vcNOIZ into a VCA and EG you can create crazy warping noise pads to layer with your other sounds. You can use a percussive envelope and generate awesome sounding hihats. You can also use it as a random gate source for clocking things by using the DC coupled output -- the sky is the limit!</p>

</div></div>","hexinverter.net's vcNOIZ is a unique exponentially voltage controlled noise oscillator for analogue synthesis. It creates absolutely crunchy sounding Commodore 64-esque noise



It will be available in DIY (""do it yourself) form (Eurorack, MU, universal) as well as Eurorack assembled SMT modules.


 
Full Description:
vcNOIZ is a gritty sounding voltage controlled noise source. The best way to imagine it is as a noise VCO. The frequency of the noise is both linearly and exponentially controllable by analogue control voltage signals. It creates positively raunchy C64-esque digital noise and sounds great for hihats and other sounds as well!
By patching vcNOIZ into a VCA and EG you can create crazy warping noise pads to layer with your other sounds. You can use a percussive envelope and generate awesome sounding hihats. You can also use it as a random gate source for clocking things by using the DC coupled output -- the sky is the limit!
It is a very unorthodox VCO that is capable of generating very interesting timbres you have not heard before.
It differs in tonal characteristic from simply putting a white noise source through a low-pass filter, because a filter will actually round off the edges of the square waves generating the noise and therefore reduce the intensity of the sound. With vcNOIZ, the actual rate at which the noise is being generated is altered by voltage control, and thus, you get to keep the raunchy sounding sharp edges of the noise. In short: it sounds pretty cool :)
It will be available as a DIY project and complete module from the hexinverter.net online shop after this campaign ends, but I need your help to do a production run of these modules. I have done some number crunching and it just won't fit in anytime soon if I am to fund it entirely myself on a university student's very limited budget!
There are no microcontrollers used in this design, so it will fit right at home in any analogue purist's setup as well. It is comprised entirely of CMOS logic and analog opamps, so does not suffer from CV aliasing or any other issues present in a microcontroller-based design.
 
Features:
Inputs:
- Expo. response CV input (-V to +V)- Linear response CV input (-V to +V) -- great for audio rate FM, as the audio demo shows. It sounds positively gruesome!- Clock input (square wave, positive logic)
Controls:
- Pitch control (to tune base frequency, just like a VCO)
Outputs:
- Base frequency noise output (a little smoother sounding than the divisions) [audio coupled]- Sub octave /4 output (gritty sounding) [audio coupled]- Sub octave /8 output (gritty sounding) [audio coupled]- Base frequency DC coupled gate output (for when wanting a random gate when using a slower clock/pitch rate)- Internal clock output (there was an extra opamp, so I figured this could be useful)

This high precision quad channel microphone models the characteristics and response of an assortment of microphone array configurations to accurately record the sound of a 3D space. The perfect tool to create VR worlds of sound.Recording SamplesPlease Check HERE For More Twirling720 VR Recording Samples. True 360° Soundfield RecordingUnlike traditional microphones which use one or two channel recording to emulate 360 ° sound, the Twirling720 VR Audio Recorder makes use of its inventive quad-channel microphone to record beyond just the horizontal plane, but also a multitude of 3D sound and elevation cues including three-dimensional polar response, direction of arrival (DOA), transient response, harmonics, and proximity effects. Each of the 4 directional inputs work together to pick up the microphone’s distance in relation to the sounds – letting you record an acoustic space as it truly exists in real life.(Prototype Testing)Post-Processing Versatility with Twirling720 StudioThe Twirling720 recorder is accompanied with our versatile post-processing software Twirling720 Studio.

<h3>What is this thing?</h3>
<p>Connect this footswitch to your computer and start recording in your favorite DAW (Pro Tools, Logic, Reaper, Ableton, etc). If you mess up while recording a take, just tap the footswitch and the bad take will automatically be deleted, the playhead moved back to where you last began recording, and a new take will begin. No need to take your hands off your instrument, press some keyboard shortcuts/move the mouse around to set up a new take.</p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>This footswitch connects to your computer as a USB human interface device, like a keyboard or a mouse. It sends a pre-programmed sequence of keystroke data (a ""macro"") to your computer whenever you press the switch with your foot.</p>

<p>I made this prototype for fun, but a lot of people told me they would be interested in having one.

I can offer a lower price if many people order at once.<br/><br/>If anyone is willing to pay a premium price for a highly custom unit (more switches, paint job/artwork, funny extra features), then I can still offer that person a lower rate than I would be able to if it was a purely one-off situation, since shipping/handling costs from suppliers will still be shared among the other orders, and part of the design process will be common to the non-customized orders.

<p align=""left""><strong>8. Powerful Amp Pushing Up To 600 ohm At 2V RMS </strong></p>
<p align=""left"">With powerful drivers comes high impedance. Most smartphones nowadays are only capable of pushing out 15mw of power.This is why the sound quality coming out from smartphones is generally disappointing. </p>
<p align=""left"">To resolve this issue, many audiophiles would purchase a separate headphone amplifier to push their high end headphones. Oftentimes, these amps would cost higher than the headphone itself.</p>
<p align=""left"">With CYBORG PX2, that problem becomes obsolete. The built-in ESS 9281C DAC is capable of pushing up to 600 ohm at 2V RMS. We make sure that users get the most out of our headsets.</p>
<p align=""left""><strong>9  Best Value For The Money</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">No more compromise with the sound quality. The best all-in-one headphone is here. Whether you’re commuting, gaming, and simply enjoying music, you’ll get the highest performance possible at a very affordable price with the CYBORG PX2. </p>
<p align=""left"">Any time , Any where , share the best listening experience with Music , Movie , Gaming </p>

<p><strong>CYBORG PX2 Integrated the best and latest technology  into one headphones </strong>, </p>
<h3>A Letter From Our Team</h3>
<p><strong><i>For The Campaign  products , we are Please to tell you it will be Made in Taiwan  .</i></strong></p>
<p>Our team members mainly consist of engineers. We like to work on new technologies. Most of our top engineers have more than 30 years of R&amp;D development experience, with knowledge in computer and system development across audio / video interfaces. </p>
<p>After doing extensive research on audio and gaming headphones, we noticed a few issues with the products currently available on the market.</p>
<p>·       The sound quality of most gaming headphones is less than ideal by audiophiles' standards.</p>
<p>·       Most audiophile headphones are expensive because of the brand, not the technology behind it.</p>
<p>·       High end brands are too expensive, while no name brands oftentimes are terrible in quality. </p>
<p>·       New technology and novel materials are not well-developed and researched enough to improve sound quality.</p>
<p>·       The importance of audio output signal quality is not emphasized enough.</p>
<p>That’s why, our team began doing integration, sourcing from the best partners such as ESS Technology for DSP / DAC, MQA for 384K/24bit music .</p>
<p>Our professional acoustic team has experience designing driver modules like the hybrid electrostatic coaxial dual driver, the planar magnetic speaker module, and of course, the coaxial type dual driver found in our CYBORG PX2.</p>
<p>Our system engineers utilize the MCU to integrate and control the DSP (Digital Signal Processor), DAC and AMP inside the ESS9281C pro chipset to achieve RF 2.4G decoding, Hi-Res / MQA rendering and EQ settings. </p>
<p>All parts and designs are individually tested by their respective team. Finally, in March 2020, we have accomplished our first prototype that passes our rigorous testing and quality check. The amazing result encouraged us to launch the campaign on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>We are proud to say Cyborg provides the best sound quality across gaming and music fields. Its budget price makes it easy for music enthusiasts of all levels to enjoy. </p>
<p>We are ready to provide beta testers our pre-production units to test out the CyBORG PX2 headphones  performance  &amp; quality. with your earliest listening   experience we can share and improved for the mass production units.</p>
<p>If you have any issues with the product, whether it’s design, function or specs, compliments or criticism, our team will be happy to help you out. We would greatly appreciate hearing back from you. This will be crucial information to help us improve our next iteration.</p>
<h3>What we are going to be focusing on next is the production side of things. </h3>
<p>We are now have done all the hardware / software with the functions and performance qualification already , we are now focusing of the last job to make sure all tooling was stablize for mass production . we will happy to share all the  new step  with all backers . in following days . </p>

1. Hi-Res Coaxial Dual Driver Module
The coaxial drivers consist of one 50mm full range driver to offer bass boost at 90Hz. While a 20mm mid to high frequency driver offers sensitivity up to 117 dB, offering the best sound field for gamers, providing a clear representation of direction, location, and distance. 
The combination of two offers the best sound experience for gaming. Both drivers have the frequency response from 20hz all the way up to 40Khz, and sensitivity up to 113dB at 1Khz.
CYBORG PX2 headphones  meets the JAS (Japan Audio Society) standards of Hi-Res audio, providing HQ sound quality to cater to your music and gaming needs. 
 

 
2. MQA rendering
As fellow audiophiles, we understand the never ending desire to pursue higher resolution. That’s why, our headphone is equipped with True Digital rendering / Hardware decoding DSP engine, integrated with ESS9281C pro Hyperstream II Quad DAC with 134dB audio output quality to complete the final  unfold of MQA audio files, at the 24 bit /384KHz resolution delivering the sound of the original master recording .

To learn more about  MQA  please go to 
How it works 
Please click How it works
3.  Xear Virtual 7.1 Surround Sound with RF Wireless Connection 
Bluetooth headphones undoubtedly free gamers from wire hassle, but latency and sound quality become a major concern. Our team has successfully integrated RF technology into the headset. The wireless connection via RF (Radio Frequency) drastically reduces latency, making it the ideal headset for intense gaming. 
Coupled with Xear Virtual 7.1 surround sound, you get a realistic 7.1 channel surround sound field with virtually lower  latency. Download the driver on your Windows devices and enhance the audio performance.
 

 
4. ESS9281C True Digital Render / Hardware Decoder
Hi-Res audio files like DSD256, PCM384K/32 bit contain a lot of data, making it a fairly demanding task for the CPU and DSP to process. Thanks to our DSP engine that’s fully integrated with the ESS9281C pro  Hyperstream II Quad DAC, we’re able to perform true digital rendering / hardware decoding and accurately recreate every detail in live concerts, games, instruments and more.
5.  Preset EQ Profiles & Broadcast for RF2.4 G Wireless 


Xear 7.1 Surround Sound: Experience Xear Virtual 7.1 channel surround sound through wireless RF 2.4G transmission by installing the adapter(Included) on your PC / NB. The built-in wireless RF2.4G receiver module decodes I2S digital audio data, while the ESS 9281Cpro Quad DAC enhances it to Hi-Fi quality. (Note: Driver required for PC. Not available on mobile devices.  Xear 7.1 Surround Sound : The RF2.4 G Tx transmitter provided the Broadcastting function for Multiple Link with More than 3 * PX2 headphones at syncronize music . ( may be more than 3 . it 's depends on contents data  rate ) ,  this function fit movie time or music time to share more people togather without any worry intererance people neboring you  in the train or movie at home . especially at night movie time . enjoy the surrounding and strong sound effect with friends and no worry to interferance your family. 

FPS ( First Person Shooter): We tone down the bass booster and enhance the treble to allow clearer player communication and voice clarity. The headset renders fine audio details to help players get a sense of direction and distance. Locating your enemies has never been easier.

6. True Digital USB Audio for Low Latency 
Playing audio through USB connection on your PC or mobile devices allows for the best audio quality and low latency. The built-in 9281C  pro Hyperstream II chip in our headphone has enough processing power to effortlessly decode Hi-Res and HQ audio and reduces buffering and delay when watching movies.
7. Versatile Audio Input 
Short battery life has been a major drawback for wireless headphones nowadays. Our headset allows you to switch to an analog 3.5mm jack or True Digital USB Audio Class 2.0 Type C connection. No power is required. Under the Type C configuration, our headset offers the lowest latency and truly allows the hardware decoder to shine in turns of its sound quality. It delivers true digital signals from the audio source. 


True Digital USB 2.0 TYPE-C Connection: MQA  rendering  24bit /384KHz ,and hardware decode  PCM384K 32bit/ DSD (Dop)5.2MHz files. (Cable included)

2.4G RF Connection: For low latency connection.

3.5mm Analog Input: The most commonly available connection. (Cable included)

Stereo Audio: Directly driving audio signal to the 40KHz speaker driver. (Stereo with Mic cable.)
 
8. Powerful Amp Pushing Up To 600 ohm At 2V RMS 
With powerful drivers comes high impedance. Most smartphones nowadays are only capable of pushing out 15mw of power.This is why the sound quality coming out from smartphones is generally disappointing. 
To resolve this issue, many audiophiles would purchase a separate headphone amplifier to push their high end headphones. Oftentimes, these amps would cost higher than the headphone itself.
With CYBORG PX2, that problem becomes obsolete. The built-in ESS 9281C DAC is capable of pushing up to 600 ohm at 2V RMS. We make sure that users get the most out of our headsets.
9  Best Value For The Money
No more compromise with the sound quality. The best all-in-one headphone is here. Whether you’re commuting, gaming, and simply enjoying music, you’ll get the highest performance possible at a very affordable price with the CYBORG PX2. 
Any time , Any where , share the best listening experience with Music , Movie , Gaming

A Letter From Our Team
For The Campaign  products , we are Please to tell you it will be Made in Taiwan  .
Our team members mainly consist of engineers. We like to work on new technologies. Most of our top engineers have more than 30 years of R&D development experience, with knowledge in computer and system development across audio / video interfaces. 
After doing extensive research on audio and gaming headphones, we noticed a few issues with the products currently available on the market.
·       The sound quality of most gaming headphones is less than ideal by audiophiles' standards.
·       Most audiophile headphones are expensive because of the brand, not the technology behind it.
·       High end brands are too expensive, while no name brands oftentimes are terrible in quality. 
·       New technology and novel materials are not well-developed and researched enough to improve sound quality.
·       The importance of audio output signal quality is not emphasized enough.
That’s why, our team began doing integration, sourcing from the best partners such as ESS Technology for DSP / DAC, MQA for 384K/24bit music .
Our professional acoustic team has experience designing driver modules like the hybrid electrostatic coaxial dual driver, the planar magnetic speaker module, and of course, the coaxial type dual driver found in our CYBORG PX2.
Our system engineers utilize the MCU to integrate and control the DSP (Digital Signal Processor), DAC and AMP inside the ESS9281C pro chipset to achieve RF 2.4G decoding, Hi-Res / MQA rendering and EQ settings. 
All parts and designs are individually tested by their respective team. Finally, in March 2020, we have accomplished our first prototype that passes our rigorous testing and quality check. The amazing result encouraged us to launch the campaign on Indiegogo.
We are proud to say Cyborg provides the best sound quality across gaming and music fields. Its budget price makes it easy for music enthusiasts of all levels to enjoy. 
We are ready to provide beta testers our pre-production units to test out the CyBORG PX2 headphones  performance  & quality. with your earliest listening   experience we can share and improved for the mass production units.
If you have any issues with the product, whether it’s design, function or specs, compliments or criticism, our team will be happy to help you out. We would greatly appreciate hearing back from you. This will be crucial information to help us improve our next iteration.
What we are going to be focusing on next is the production side of things.

<strong>What is CAEE technology?</strong>  </li></ol><p>CAEE is another of Verisonix core technology that is built-in the headphones with your original music files automatically upgrading to Hi-Res Quality.  Thru algorithm calculations the CAEE is designed to increase the sampling rate of an original file to 192K/24bit Hi-Res quality.</p><ol><li value=""4""><strong>What are the audio connection methods?  </strong></li></ol><p><strong>​</strong>Audio inputs:  Bluetooth 4.2 wireless connection, 2.5mm phone jack, USB digital streaming via Micro USB, and a built-in MP3 players.</p><ol><li value=""5""><strong>Which format does the built-in player support?</strong></li></ol><p>The built-in player supports MP3, WMA, APE, FLAC, and WAV format.</p><ol><li value=""6""><strong>What is the USB digital streaming via Micro USB Audio connection for?</strong></li></ol><p>When connecting with PC or laptop, it supports DSD256 and PCM format where you will be able to listen to uncompressed Hi-Res music just as recorded in the professional studio.</p><ol><li value=""7""><strong>What’s the memory capacity of the built-in player? </strong></li></ol><p>The built-in player is with 8GB memory capacity.  It will hold over 2500 MP3 songs.</p><ol><li value=""8""><strong>Is the ear-pad replaceable?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, it is replaceable.</p><ol><li value=""9""><strong>What is the Bluetooth effective range?</strong></li></ol><p>The effective range is over 10 meters.

 2. HYBRID:  We offer the Most Powerful Combination.Verisonix is the first in the world capable of combining both Electrostatic and Dynamic drivers in a speaker.  Why?  Because we’d like to re-define how Hi-Res quality music should sound.Electrostatz® + Dynamic Driver: 
How does hybrid driver elevate your listening enjoyments:  
Each driver operates on its dedicated tasks.     Meaning:  Each driver is doing what it does best; the bass you get is firm and sturdy and the high notes is extremely clean and crisp.  The tiniest sounds from high notes will not be drawn out by the bass.  This greatly reduces distortions and uneven sound waves a conventional speaker driver has when reproducing bass and high notes simultaneously.      Sensitivity from 5Hz to 50KHz is consistently kept at its best @114db/mw.      Meaning:  The volume reproduced from sub-bass, bass, mid, high to ultra high notes are precise, clear, and powerful.  You will be able to hear more sounds in a song and more instruments that were played in an orchestra concert.          The patented Electrostatz® Technology makes it the best Hybrid headphones in the world.  Meaning:  What could have cost you thousands in exchange of its finest timbre and fidelity, the Electrostatic driver, is now within reach.  Frequency up to 50KHz for breath taking high notes as well as the blood pumping bass generated from the dynamic speaker making HP102/HP112 the best Hybrid headphones in the world.           3. Co-exist in Harmony: Alignments & Calibrations.  4. Electrostatic Speaker?The electrostatic headphones are still far from the mass market because: 
Entry Model average retail price starts from USD1,500.
Mobility restrains; Need a stand-alone amplifier.
Complicate in making.  High-Tech. barrier to enter.
   Why Must Electrostatic speaker?! 

Sonic transparent structure:  Low distortions and resonance.
Ultra-thin diaphragm reproducing clean high frequency up to 50KHz with ease.

Silky-smooth overtones lingering on from soprano much like the ripples spreading out endlessly on a peaceful lake.  
  What we have achieved!Electrostatz®, the patented technology that takes years to research and develop is now turning traditional electrostatic headphones into:  
Portable:  Self-sufficient in driving the speaker unit.
Low in power consumption:  Without the needs of a stand-alone Amplifier.

Affordable to own while still getting the finest sound quality. 

Increase the versatility in applications.
 We are now taking one step further installing this complete set of Electrostatz® dual driver technology into the HP102/HP112 headphones.  Get ready to experience the breath-taking Hi-resolution sounds and extensive details this headphones will bring you!  5. CAEE Technology:  Free upgrading to Hi-Res Music.The fact is that even with the most expensive Hi-Fi speaker in the world there’s no guarantee for good quality sounds depending on the music source played.  Music nowadays can be acquired on-line, thru streaming apps, or using peer-to-peer sharing, and the qualities of them can vary greatly.   The CAEE is created just for this purpose by upgrading your music source to Hi-Res quality thru algorithm calculations.  By increasing the sampling rate of audio files, the Electrostatz® Hybrid headphones or speakers will perform at its best.The picture on the right  resembles the similarity in concept with CAEE Technology of how the screen resolution is enhanced off a surveillance camera to get facial recognition or a plate number.Inevitably we need to adapt to how we are connected to music in this changing market.  Wireless connections no longer means to give in to sound quality with the CAEE technology.   6. Why Balanced Signal Audio?Simply said, using balanced signal audio greatly reduces sound noise that was generated when audio signal passes thru the wires much similar to noise cancellation system.  This is why we have the HP102/HP112 headphones support balanced signal audio input. 
  Why Balanced Signal Audio and how it is immune to Noise.
 By doing the signal inverting, the noise got cancelled out from each other.  The wire carrying the inverted audio signal flips back at the end of the wire before reaching to the receiver leaving a noise-free audio signal.     In the Making: Electrostatz® Hybrid Dual-Driver.  The Best Scenarios to listen to theHP102 & HP112: Whenever you need Big Sound Stage Performance. When Sound Positioning is a matter of Life and Death. Simply when you need great Music.No matter what style of music you live for, the built-in EQ will let you fall for your favorite tunes even more.  Store your vibes in the built-in 8GB MP3 player and let the music follow you! When Studio Sound is all you Crave for. When you need a timeout from reality.  Our First Beta Demo  Electrostatz® Hybrid Headphones Characteristics: Product Features:

What is CAEE technology?  CAEE is another of Verisonix core technology that is built-in the headphones with your original music files automatically upgrading to Hi-Res Quality.  Thru algorithm calculations the CAEE is designed to increase the sampling rate of an original file to 192K/24bit Hi-Res quality.What are the audio connection methods?  ​Audio inputs:  Bluetooth 4.2 wireless connection, 2.5mm phone jack, USB digital streaming via Micro USB, and a built-in MP3 players.Which format does the built-in player support?The built-in player supports MP3, WMA, APE, FLAC, and WAV format.What is the USB digital streaming via Micro USB Audio connection for?When connecting with PC or laptop, it supports DSD256 and PCM format where you will be able to listen to uncompressed Hi-Res music just as recorded in the professional studio.What’s the memory capacity of the built-in player? The built-in player is with 8GB memory capacity.  It will hold over 2500 MP3 songs.Is the ear-pad replaceable?Yes, it is replaceable.What is the Bluetooth effective range?The effective range is over 10 meters. (over 30 meters in open area.)What is the battery usage time?Over 12 hours continuous usage.Is there any built-in EQ (equalizer) mode?Yes, the HP102/HP112 come with three EQ modes:  Music, Movie, & Gaming.What language does it support?English and Chinese or English and Japanese.13. When connected with analog-in cable (wired mode), will the headphones still work even when the battery is out?No, you will have to re-charge the headphones to make it work even when it's in wired mode. The reason is that the built-in CAEE system in our headphones enhances audio quality of all sources from 48K/8bit up to 192K/24 bit.  To ensure the upgrading of the input sound quality the power needs to be applied for this main feature to perform at its best.  Other Bluetooth & Line-in headphones do not have CAEE feature hence they might work under wired mode even when the batteries is low with direct line connect by mechanical switch.",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello, I’m Dylan, currently I’m in the 11th grade and enrolled in a Junior Achievement JA Company Program to help me learn how to run and manage a business. My name is Nasiir and I’m also in the 11th grade participating in JA Company Program. WE ARE Mega Games!</p>
<p>We came up with our idea because we are avid card players. While we enjoy playing cards, we want to play by the rules and avoid disputes. Our product will revolutionize card game rules as it will enable all people, including those who may have disabilities; visual or learning impairments, the opportunity to have easy access for understanding the rules of the game - delivered via a customized audio rule book. To put it frankly, Mega Games House Rules will prevent disagreements between families and friends over the rules by providing a better experience during family night card games, after all, the rules will be loud and clear!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our current goal is set at $10,000. This will allow us to produce a higher amount of product and to expand our organization across the United States. This money will be invested towards maintaining a quality product, new collaborations with customers to build out new rule books as well as enable opportunities to eventually lead to employing a new team to help lead the business forward, Further, we look to donate part of our profits (from a specific perk titled Mega Games for EVERYONE!) to the American Association Of People With Disabilities (AAPD). </p>
<p>We offer a variety of different perks that allow our backers to pick out specific topics or rewards such as putting your money towards the AAPD, paying salaries for the hard working kids throughout this program, receiving exclusive offer items not available to everyone, and the option to back various perks while still not breaking your own bank!<br/>We can optimize the use of the funds by putting the majority of our backers' funds towards the production even if we don’t achieve the entire goal.

Welcome to Mega Games!
Hello, I’m Dylan, currently I’m in the 11th grade and enrolled in a Junior Achievement JA Company Program to help me learn how to run and manage a business. My name is Nasiir and I’m also in the 11th grade participating in JA Company Program. WE ARE Mega Games!

<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-size: 36px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 40px;background-color: initial;"">What is <i>Sprout</i>? It's a stereo amplifier for the <i>modern</i> <i>home</i>!  </span><br/></figure>
<p>Sprout is the link between your music and your speakers. Sprout is the size of a big novel, yet it will fill your living room, bedroom or any room with enormous, live sound. Sprout is designed down to the smallest detail, and built to last from stainless steel, extruded aluminum, and walnut. This is not audio equipment. It's audio<i> jewelry</i>. <br/><br/>We know that most folks these days live in smaller homes. Sprout provides the performance of a big system in a small, easy-to-use package that will blend in to any decor. You won't have to hide Sprout, and you won't want to!</p>
<h1>What does <i>Sprout</i> do?</h1>
<div>Sprout allows you to play music or sound from almost any source imaginable. With Sprout you can listen from:</div>
<h1>
<ul>
<li>Any Bluetooth enabled device: tablet, phone, or computer(built-in Bluetooth receiver)</li>
<li>Turntable to play vinyl records (built-in phono preamp)</li>
<li>TV or gaming console, or even a reel-to-reel tape deck  (analog input)</li>
<li>Computer through USB (built-in hi-res digital-to-analog-converter/DAC)</li>
<li>CD or DVD player over Coax </li>
</ul>
</h1>
<h1>
<b>What can<i> Sprout </i></b><b>play through?</b>
</h1>
<ul>
<li>Any Size Speakers (50 watt per channel amplifier into 4 ohms)</li>
<li>All Headphones (built-in headphone amp w/front-panel jack)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h1>How do I use <i>Sprout</i>?</h1>
<div>Sprout asks only two questions:</div>
<div>
<i>What do you want to listen to</i>? and</div>
<div>
<i>How loud</i>? </div>
<div>Sprout's two control knobs answer those questions--with the input knob on the left  you choose from Vinyl/Analog/Digital/Bluetooth. No menus, no screens, no tiny remote control to loose. The knob on the right is the volume control: just turn it to the right for louder, turn it to the loft for softer. Easy, direct, intuitive. Instant tactile feedback, a direct connection to your music. Click-click-BOOM.</div>

<h1>You love music, don't you?</h1>
<p>Me too. I'm Scott McGowan. 32-year-old audio-enthusiast, concert-goer, and amplifier-designer. I work at PS Audio in Boulder, Colorado. I've been around HiFi systems my entire life because I love LIVE music. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I play music on my small stereo at home, it just doesn't sound live. But all that has changed.</p>
<h1>Home audio can be done better!</h1>
<p>PS Audio makes high-end stereo systems for audiophiles. An audiophile's goal is to reproduce live music exactly as it is heard on stage. Can that actually be done?</p>
<p>You bet. Our company does it every day.</p>
<p>It's not something most of us can afford however. It's not something most of us have space for, either.</p>

</div>","What is Sprout? It's a stereo amplifier for the modern home!  
Sprout is the link between your music and your speakers. Sprout is the size of a big novel, yet it will fill your living room, bedroom or any room with enormous, live sound. Sprout is designed down to the smallest detail, and built to last from stainless steel, extruded aluminum, and walnut. This is not audio equipment. It's audio jewelry. We know that most folks these days live in smaller homes. Sprout provides the performance of a big system in a small, easy-to-use package that will blend in to any decor. You won't have to hide Sprout, and you won't want to!
What does Sprout do?
Sprout allows you to play music or sound from almost any source imaginable. With Sprout you can listen from:


Any Bluetooth enabled device: tablet, phone, or computer(built-in Bluetooth receiver)
Turntable to play vinyl records (built-in phono preamp)
TV or gaming console, or even a reel-to-reel tape deck  (analog input)
Computer through USB (built-in hi-res digital-to-analog-converter/DAC)
CD or DVD player over Coax 



What can Sprout play through?


Any Size Speakers (50 watt per channel amplifier into 4 ohms)
All Headphones (built-in headphone amp w/front-panel jack)


How do I use Sprout?
Sprout asks only two questions:

What do you want to listen to? and

How loud? 
Sprout's two control knobs answer those questions--with the input knob on the left  you choose from Vinyl/Analog/Digital/Bluetooth. No menus, no screens, no tiny remote control to loose. The knob on the right is the volume control: just turn it to the right for louder, turn it to the loft for softer. Easy, direct, intuitive. Instant tactile feedback, a direct connection to your music. Click-click-BOOM.

Yet who doesn't want concert-quality music in their living room?  From our phones, turntables, computers or CD players: that's how most people listen to music...
These things really frustrate me:



...and the back is even worse!

Sprout will change forever the way you listen to music at home, from the lowest quality downloads to the highest quality discs, to your best LP's. If you love music like I do, Sprout will change your life and your relationship to music.

By joining our love for music with careful integration of technology and high-range audio components, we’ve created a turntable of the future for the medium of the past.             At MAG – LEV Audio we love innovation and music. We were searching for a way to give people a better, newer way to experience vinyl records. By pushing the frontier of audio technology, we were able to integrate the uplifting experience of music into the turntable design itself, bringing the feeling of zero gravity into your living room.   
 The First Levitating Turntable is designed for people who appreciate high quality sound and innovative design. It comes with a Pre-Fitted tonearm and cartridge. This setup allows you to connect through phono in. Once you’re done, you just have to pick your favorite record, turn the turntable on, move the tone arm into position and lower the cueing lever.

This function keeps your records from being scratched and also prolongs the life of the cartridge.When it comes to vinyl, the cueing mechanism plays a vital role in the listening experience. The gentle drop and the precision of the needle is what make the entire process feel even more satisfying. Picking your favorite song becomes simple and even beautiful. You can switch between 33,3-rpm and 45-rpm with just a turn of a button. To ensure you have everything you need, we’ve supplied you with a 45-rpm adapter, so you can enjoy all types of records.
 We’ve added platter feet, which allow the platter to rest in OFF mode. These feet automatically retract when you begin using the turntable. When the tonearm is placed back in its original position, the platter feet will automatically rise up and you can safely switch off the turntable. Accidents happen, and we know that sometimes you may encounter a power outage, so we’ve designed the turntable with a UPS system. This solution stores enough power to safely lift the tonearm, stop the record, and return the platter feet to resting position.

Stock is limited, so the offer ends when stock runs out. Learn more at <a href=""http://vfepedals.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vfepedals.com</a><br/> </p>
<h3>SPS System by v(e) design</h3>
<p>My name is Peter Rutter, and I teach math &amp; circuits at IDEA High School in Tacoma, WA. In 2010 I launched a guitar pedal company called VFE Pedals. As I transition away from running a pedal manufacturing company to part-time design work, I wanted to design something to give back to the DIY &amp; boutique builder community that had helped me so much over the past decade.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570396363/rk7tynmzgpl7rdgs3tpz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Pinout from SPS system - +9V, send to input of effect, buffer output from effect, negative voltage rail from charge pump, ground, positive voltage from charge pump, return from output of effect, LED voltage output, momentary footswitch connection, bypass indicator voltage (goes high when pedal is off), and oscillator output from charge pump</i></p>
<p>The SPS System is my love letter to DIY &amp; boutique pedal builders. SPS stands for Studio Power + Switching, and sets a new standard for what is possible in a compact guitar pedal form factor. Here is a list of features packed into one small circuit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Relay switching controlled by a microcontroller. The relay is non-latching, and will switch to bypass if power is lost. The microcontroller lets you control the relay with any momentary ON-OFF switch.</li>
<li>Charge pump boosts 9V input voltage to approximately +/- 15V for dual-supply circuits. This type of power is commonly found in analog rackmount studio gear, not compact guitar pedals.</li>
<li>Internal switch and dedicated connection point allow for easy integration of a buffered switching option.</li>
<li>DualMode allows the user to toggle from standard latching operation to a momentary mode that only activates the effect while the footswitch is held down.</li>
<li>Overvoltage and reverse voltage protection diodes, plus a power inductor to significantly filter out noise &amp; interference on the power line.</li>
<li>Top-mounted audio and power jacks can fit into the compact 1590B2 or 1590BS form factor.</li>
<li>Many connection points aligned for easy connection to the effect PCB using a single ribbon cable.</li>
</ul>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need + Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>I have set a modest startup goal of $5000 to enable a production run of the SPS system PCB. The manufacturing cost lowers significantly if we can raise over $10,000, so I have added some pretty sweet stretch goals.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$5,000 - minimum amount needed to make a run of SPS system PCBs (unlocked)</strong></li>
<li><strong>$7,500 - 5 additional DIY effects will be made available (unlocked)</strong></li>
<li><strong>$10,000 - ENIG plating upgrade to all SPS system PCBs (unlocked)</strong></li>
<li><strong>$15,000 - Current output of the charge pump circuit will be increased</strong></li>
<li>$20,000 - P3 phantom power system added to all SPS system PCBs. This would give an extra power option using standard TRS cables instead of separate cables for power &amp; audio signal.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570396603/hh7x0qtspmlylap92ppy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>A pedal built with an early prototype of the SPS system. I used this prototype to tweak/tune the circuit and make updates to use in the production version.</i></p>

<p><i><i>9V in, 29V out. The built-in charge pump converts +9V into about +/- 15V. The voltage output is not regulated and varies based on total current draw.</i></i></p>
<div>
<h3>Perks!</h3>
<p>There are several perks, but they all fall into 3 basic categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>SPS System - get fully assembled PCB(s) to use in your next project. Jacks &amp; PCBs to build VFE effects are optional add-ons at different perk levels.</li>
<li>Barebone kits - get the fully assembled SPS system, pre-drilled enclosure, pots/jacks/switches, and empty PCB of the effect of your choice. The full list of available PCBs can be found from the effects listed at <a href=""http://vfepedals.com/discontinued.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vfepedals.com/discontinued</a> (all except the RUP). I will create a Mouser part list for each kit to help you source the resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, ICs, and other small components.</li>
<li>Fully assembled pedals - I am making a custom run of pedals in the summer of 2020. I have stopped manufacturing pedals in general, so these are available exclusively through this Indiegogo campaign. <strong>NOTE - While you will be asked for some custom details at checkout, you will not be asked which effect you want. I will gather this information after the campaign ends.</strong><br/> </li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571544318/ute9uyw5pifyaxi20me9.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>All 26 original VFE Pedals are available through the custom pedal perk (see above). Each pedal will be updated with the SPS system, and include hand-painted graphics. See the image below for a comparison between the original VFE Pedal and one built with the new SPS system &amp; hand-painted graphics.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571544410/qqopjbxsb4ltdvjwn5gv.png"" src=""""/></i></p>

<p>The Standout mid booster was the direct sequel to the Focus mid booster. So what makes them different in this campaign? Nothing major. The bottom line is that I only had enough custom dual-gang pots remaining to build a limited run of the Standout, which has sold out. However, I can re-configure the board to work the same way as the original Focus. Here are the only differences between the two pedals:<br/><br/>#1 - HPF = TIGHT and LPF = SMOOTH, but in reverse. Both controls work the same, but in the Focus, turning clockwise lowers the cutoff frequency.<br/>#2 - The Focus is available at the $200 custom pedal tier. The Standout is NOT available as a custom option.<br/>#3 - The graphic will be different. In the image above, the Standout is on the left and the Focus is on the right.</p>
<p>For information about my current plans to change/update each pedal, check out the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/studio-power-switching-system-for-guitar-pedals#/updates/all"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">update posted on October 14</a>.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The money raised from this campaign will be used to accomplish 3 things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The SPS system will enable the DIY &amp; boutique builder community to design &amp; build with a studio-grade dual-supply power system and durable relay switching.</li>
<li>I will use a portion of the funds to remake the original VFE Pedal lineup in a new form factor, as I prepare them for licensed manufacturing by another company.</li>
<li>5% of the total amount raised will be donated to 63 6c 75 62, a student club that designs &amp; builds custom solutions to benefit the student body at IDEA High School in Tacoma, WA.</li>
</ul>

Stock is limited, so the offer ends when stock runs out. Learn more at vfepedals.com 
SPS System by v(e) design
My name is Peter Rutter, and I teach math & circuits at IDEA High School in Tacoma, WA. In 2010 I launched a guitar pedal company called VFE Pedals. As I transition away from running a pedal manufacturing company to part-time design work, I wanted to design something to give back to the DIY & boutique builder community that had helped me so much over the past decade.

Pinout from SPS system - +9V, send to input of effect, buffer output from effect, negative voltage rail from charge pump, ground, positive voltage from charge pump, return from output of effect, LED voltage output, momentary footswitch connection, bypass indicator voltage (goes high when pedal is off), and oscillator output from charge pump
The SPS System is my love letter to DIY & boutique pedal builders. SPS stands for Studio Power + Switching, and sets a new standard for what is possible in a compact guitar pedal form factor. Here is a list of features packed into one small circuit.

Relay switching controlled by a microcontroller. The relay is non-latching, and will switch to bypass if power is lost. The microcontroller lets you control the relay with any momentary ON-OFF switch.
Charge pump boosts 9V input voltage to approximately +/- 15V for dual-supply circuits. This type of power is commonly found in analog rackmount studio gear, not compact guitar pedals.
Internal switch and dedicated connection point allow for easy integration of a buffered switching option.
DualMode allows the user to toggle from standard latching operation to a momentary mode that only activates the effect while the footswitch is held down.
Overvoltage and reverse voltage protection diodes, plus a power inductor to significantly filter out noise & interference on the power line.
Top-mounted audio and power jacks can fit into the compact 1590B2 or 1590BS form factor.
Many connection points aligned for easy connection to the effect PCB using a single ribbon cable.




What We Need + Stretch Goals
I have set a modest startup goal of $5000 to enable a production run of the SPS system PCB. The manufacturing cost lowers significantly if we can raise over $10,000, so I have added some pretty sweet stretch goals.

$5,000 - minimum amount needed to make a run of SPS system PCBs (unlocked)
$7,500 - 5 additional DIY effects will be made available (unlocked)
$10,000 - ENIG plating upgrade to all SPS system PCBs (unlocked)
$15,000 - Current output of the charge pump circuit will be increased
$20,000 - P3 phantom power system added to all SPS system PCBs. This would give an extra power option using standard TRS cables instead of separate cables for power & audio signal.


A pedal built with an early prototype of the SPS system. I used this prototype to tweak/tune the circuit and make updates to use in the production version.

9V in, 29V out. The built-in charge pump converts +9V into about +/- 15V. The voltage output is not regulated and varies based on total current draw.

Perks!
There are several perks, but they all fall into 3 basic categories:

SPS System - get fully assembled PCB(s) to use in your next project. Jacks & PCBs to build VFE effects are optional add-ons at different perk levels.
Barebone kits - get the fully assembled SPS system, pre-drilled enclosure, pots/jacks/switches, and empty PCB of the effect of your choice. The full list of available PCBs can be found from the effects listed at vfepedals.com/discontinued (all except the RUP). I will create a Mouser part list for each kit to help you source the resistors, capacitors, diodes, transistors, ICs, and other small components.
Fully assembled pedals - I am making a custom run of pedals in the summer of 2020. I have stopped manufacturing pedals in general, so these are available exclusively through this Indiegogo campaign. NOTE - While you will be asked for some custom details at checkout, you will not be asked which effect you want. I will gather this information after the campaign ends. 


All 26 original VFE Pedals are available through the custom pedal perk (see above). Each pedal will be updated with the SPS system, and include hand-painted graphics. See the image below for a comparison between the original VFE Pedal and one built with the new SPS system & hand-painted graphics.
Check out the full library of pedals at vfepedals.com/discontinued (does not include RUP). This includes demo videos and an interactive diagram of how each pedal works.


The Standout mid booster was the direct sequel to the Focus mid booster. So what makes them different in this campaign? Nothing major. The bottom line is that I only had enough custom dual-gang pots remaining to build a limited run of the Standout, which has sold out. However, I can re-configure the board to work the same way as the original Focus. Here are the only differences between the two pedals:#1 - HPF = TIGHT and LPF = SMOOTH, but in reverse. Both controls work the same, but in the Focus, turning clockwise lowers the cutoff frequency.#2 - The Focus is available at the $200 custom pedal tier. The Standout is NOT available as a custom option.#3 - The graphic will be different. In the image above, the Standout is on the left and the Focus is on the right.
For information about my current plans to change/update each pedal, check out the update posted on October 14.
 



The Impact
The money raised from this campaign will be used to accomplish 3 things:

The SPS system will enable the DIY & boutique builder community to design & build with a studio-grade dual-supply power system and durable relay switching.
I will use a portion of the funds to remake the original VFE Pedal lineup in a new form factor, as I prepare them for licensed manufacturing by another company.
5% of the total amount raised will be donated to 63 6c 75 62, a student club that designs & builds custom solutions to benefit the student body at IDEA High School in Tacoma, WA.

If we do not raise a minimum of $5000 through this campaign, then I cannot move forward on any of these 3 things.

Parts of the funds will be used to re-design the original VFE Pedal lineup, in preparation of a re-launch of these pedals by a 3rd party in 2021.

Risks & Challenges
I have successfully funded and filled perks for 7 crowdfunding campaigns, and have built thousands of pedals over the past 12 years. I have made multiple prototypes and am ready to start finalizing the design for large-scale manufacturing. While I am confident that I can deliver every perk in this campaign, here are some factors that could delay the projected timeline.

Alignment with teaching schedule - if the above delays shift production enough to prevent me from using my breaks in the teaching schedule to build pedals, it could add further delays.

The projected ship dates for each perk has factored in these potential delays already, and I will send updates with and new projected ship dates if there will be any manufacturing delays.

</div></div>","Inspired by Montessori principles (as well as the cassette players of our youth), Yoto is an audio player that works with physical cards to give children back control over what they choose to play.  At its heart, Yoto is a modern take on a children’s Hi-Fi, with the clever stuff that comes from being ‘connected’, but without the concerns that come with open access to the internet.  Yoto plays a wide range of content: from favourite nursery rhymes and songs to get the kids dancing, to classic stories from authors like Roald Dahl, as well as podcasts and radio from around the world.From learning the alphabet with phonics, and practising scales on the piano, to sound-effects for role-playing and acting out - Yoto is smart, but safe, and lots of fun, and we’re proud to show you what it can do.Children simply choose a card they like, and slot it in the top of Yoto to make that content play. It’s as simple as that! Yoto comes with enough cards to get you started, and you can order more cards at any time to be posted directly to your door. You can even make your own custom cards from songs and content you already own. You can also choose to join the Yoto Club and, based on your child’s age and interests, we will curate a selection of cards that get delivered throughout the year, with content that evolves as your child develops.Children love being in control - and with Yoto they control when they listen to content - but ultimately, via the Yoto parents app, you’re in control of what your kids listen to.  It’s a balance that we feel can get lost with other internet connected devices. Voice-recognition speaker systems can be great, but feel a bit creepy when used by children. Screen based gadgets like smartphones and tablets are amazing, but there's always the nagging fear of what’s three clicks away from that cute cat video on Youtube.  Yoto addresses both concerns. It doesn't have a microphone or camera to spy on your children. And its carefully curated ecosystem allows no access to internet nasties.And throughout two years of testing Yoto with families in their homes, we’ve seen how well it works - for children and their parents.
The strength of Yoto is in the quality and range of the cards we offer, and we’re working flat out behind the scenes, building a library of content that we are truly excited about.
UPDATE (November 17th):  We are thrilled to be able to announce that we are now working the Roald Dahl Literary Estate to bring the characters and stories from the world's number one storyteller to the Yoto Library.
Out of the box, Yoto will come with enough cards to ensure there is always something new to listen to. That’s because of the six smart ways that Yoto works:

 

This is the foundation on which the Yoto library is built, with stacks of cards that play all your favourite music and stories, as well as new ones you may not have heard yet.  Music to get them dancing, nursery rhymes to sing along to, classical music (because it’s awesome) and modern hits to release their inner pop star. 
We are teaming up with the good people at Roald Dahl to bring you stories like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The BFG and much more.As well as that, we have stories like the Three Little Pigs and Beauty and the Beast, the best of Beatrix Potter’s Peter Rabbit all commissioned by us with fresh narrations, as well as the best modern children’s literature reworked for Yoto - for which we are already in talks with some more of the best-loved children’s authors.

 

Where Yoto comes into its own, with cards that are interactive and educational. Designed around Montessori principles, learning can become a fun family activity.  
Yoto can support language development with Phonics Cards, help them learn to count all the way to 100 with Numbers Cards, learn Shapes and Colours with cards that can also be used outside of Yoto as flash cards. Yoto can even help them start to master a second language with a range of content for the budding multi-linguist.

 

Tap into a world of family radio, with cards that stream live radio content from channels around the world, all hand picked by our team of editors.
(You could even use Yoto to listen to Radio 4 while you make the dinner - if you can drag your kids away from it.)

We are incredibly excited about podcasts, and the way they have opened up a world of ideas and thinking that is changing the way programming works. Podcasts are amazing - but it can be tricky to find the good ones from within all that choice. And playing them has always involved a screen, up to now.  
Your Yoto cards automatically update to play the most recent podcasts from a particular show, and we scour the globe to bring you the best new dollops of wonderfulness.

Even without cards, Yoto can surprise, delight and inform - every day.  
Yoto Daily is your daily update of the seasonal and the topical. Count down to Christmas with our advent calendar, hear a poem on World Poetry Day, get a funny joke to tell you friends, find fun facts to fascinate a fellow fellow, celebrate the first day of Spring, or the last man on the moon.  
Yoto Daily can even tell you what the weather will be each day, which is actually really cool.

 

Got a library of 5,000 songs already? No problem - simply upload an album through the app and we’ll send you a Yoto card to make it play (or you can decorate your own 'mix tape' cards with stickers).

Want to record your own version of the The Three Little Pigs? Who wouldn’t? - just fire up the app and get huffing and puffing!  
Got grandparents who miss the little ones in between visits? Sounds like us - if you download the app for them, recording a personalised story is as easy as making a phone call. And since the story is on the card, your child can hear it over and over again, whenever they like.

 

 

 
Yoto started with a hunch, that there must be a way to bring music and stories - and even connected content - to our own children without having to resort to phones and screens, and without having to dig the old CD player out of the loft.  
But we knew we needed to test our ideas with other families, so we could be sure we were on the right track.  
We’ve been sharing Yoto prototypes with families for the last two years, and without wanting to blow our own trumpet, we know it works.  
We’ve seen early toddlers starting to explore a world of audio with nursery rhymes and animal sounds, right up to great big tweens getting hooked on science podcasts.  
But don’t just take our word for it, watch our early prototype testers explain their experience with Yoto.

Also it's a Hi-Fi Bluetooth music receiver that streams high quality audio wirelessly from any Bluetooth enabled smartphone, computer or tablet to any music system or powered speakers.


Incorporating the high quality aptX® LOW LATENCY audio streaming codec and digital TOSLINK connection, beamit provides Hi-Fi digital audio streaming to up to two Bluetooth headphones or speakers simultaneously. 









beamit allows you to use any headphones or speakers to enjoy high fidelity wireless audio.
beamit uses the finest Bluetooth 4.1 technology to stream clear, distortion-free digital audio from your TV, smart device or laptop to Bluetooth enabled headphones, speakers, and other receivers up to 33 feet away.


beamit supports Advanced Audio Coding (AAC), aptX® and aptX® LOW LATENCY Bluetooth audio codecs for high fidelity, low latency audio with aptX®-enabled headphones. Bluetooth 4.1 with aptX® and AAC codecs gives you uncompromising wireless sound, delivering full-range dynamic sound with crystal clarity.


       Products with aptX®  |  Products with aptX® LOW LATENCY
The delay between your TV and speakers is a common problem within many wireless audio solutions. aptX® LOW LATENCY technology reduces this latency down to less than 40 ms, eliminating lip-sync issues to give you the smoothest audio/visual experience available.


beamit will provide the best possible audio quality and minimize audio latency only when used with headphones or receivers that support aptX® Low Latency technology. Otherwise, beamit will default to the best codec that is supported by the headphones or receivers connected to it.


Designed to stream real-time audio to two Bluetooth headphones simultaneously, beamit is the perfect solution for users to watch shows, listen to songs, or play games on their TV with someone else at high volume, without disturbing other people in the room.

When streaming to two headphones/speakers, beamit will default to the best available codec.
beamit even lets you stream wirelessly to two Bluetooth enabled speakers at once, for a supreme stereo setup.


Featuring both digital and analog audio Inputs and Outputs, beamit provides the widest compatibility to a wide variety of devices (eg. old and new TVs, stereo systems, etc. )


It seamlessly connects with any device with Optical (TOSLINK S/PDIF), RCA or 3.5mm stereo audio output like TV's, home audio systems, laptops, digital streaming boxes (including Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV), etc.
beamit conveniently draws power from the included micro USB charging cable that can be plugged into any powered USB port such as USB wall adapter, computer, or recent TVs and sound systems.


beamit operates either as a transmitter or a receiver. Switch easily between transmitter mode (TX) and receiver mode (RX) with the flick of a button located at the back of the device.


Transmitter Mode (TX)
In TX mode, beamit can wirelessly stream audio from a non-Bluetooth device (HDTV / Computer) to any Bluetooth audio receiver that supports the A2DP Bluetooth profile, such as a Bluetooth headphone, Bluetooth speaker, or dedicated A2DP receiver.

AUDIO INPUTS are used with TX MODE ONLY – When in TX mode beamit needs an audio source to transmit. It must be fed an audio signal from a connected device such as a television, video game system, computer, mp3 player, etc.
Receiver Mode (RX)
In RX mode, beamit enables wireless audio streaming from any Bluetooth enabled smartphone, computer or tablet to any non-Bluetooth music system or powered speakers.

AUDIO OUTPUTS are used with RX MODE ONLY – When in RX mode beamit is receiving an audio signal and passing that signal from its output to the input of some type of ampliﬁcation device like a home stereo, bookshelf speaker, car audio, etc.


Pairing any headphone, speaker or smart device to beamit is simple and effortless.


Just slide and hold the spring-loaded Multi-function Switch on the front of the unit briefly to the right and release, it automatically goes into pairing mode.

It will pair automatically with any headphone or other Bluetooth receiver / speaker that is also in pairing mode and located within 1 meter (3 feet).

In case of a smart device, simply activate Bluetooth, select ""auris beamit"" from the list of available devices.


After pairing, select your desired audio Input (Optical ↔ Aux) by sliding the Multi-function Switch and that’s it - you’re ready to stream from any of your favorite devices.


The sleek and compact beamit has been thoughtfully designed to look great and completely blend in any setting without taking up too much space.


beamit can be conveniently mounted on your TV, home audio systems, computer, car dashboard or work desk with the hassle-free, non – adhesive sticky gel mounts.

HiBy R6 got 9.2 scores in Headfonics, click here to see the whole review


 
We have developed two body versions for HiBy R6. The aluminum alloy body version comes in 2 different colors (Black or Gray) for individual aesthetic appeal. 
The stainless steel body uses the 316L stainless steel, the hardest grade of metal ever crafted into an electronic device chassis, providing class-leading aesthetics and durability simultaneously.
All the specs between two versions are the same except the body material. 
1. HiBy R62. 2.5mm to 3.5mm Line Out Cable3. USB Type C Cable4. Screen Protector5. SD Card Slot Needle Here you see a 1kHz square wave signal sampled at 192kHz, being put out by a music app on android.  On usual Android devices this signal would be resampled and mixed into the fixed 48kHz system audio stream, producing a digital output to the DAC like the upper picture. Whereas on the R6, DTA architecture bypasses Android Sample Rate Conversion (SRC) for all apps, the signal would pass unaltered to the DAC like the lower picture.So you see, in the past you could get a phone or player with a ""quad DAC"", or even a power-hungry 8-channel ES9018S meant for home audio.  But today for the first time, you will be sending the original signal to the DAC, to be converted into the original sound reaching your ears.  From almost all Android apps, not just the one or two hi-res compatible apps bundled with the player.HiBy Music specializes in research, development and sales of high quality portable audio products.  With over 30 professional audio R&D staff, over 10 years of history in the portable audio field, we have jointly developed dozens of portable digital audio players (DAPs), earphones, USB DACs, etc. With several well known portable audio brands.  Our own HiByMusic smartphone audio player app also has a user base of 500 thousand users spread over 90 countries around the globe and has won accolades from professional users regarding its audio quality.It core staff (shown here) have varied and overlapping backgrounds, from wireless communications (Fanoble) to audio electronics (Rick, Libin) to software engineering (Jet) and psychoacoustics (Joe).  They hail from various parts of China as well as Australia and Hong Kong (Joe).  All have at least a decade of relevant industry experience*.  They take on the core tasks of the company from product research and conception (Fanoble, Rick) to design (Jet, Deng) to relations and service (Joe).*Except Joe--he started working in audio in 2013 but has been an audiophile since birth ;)HiBy Music possesses its own R&D capability over the whole audio reproduction chain, including key audio processing algorithms and ability to design its own FPGA-based audio processing chips.With its base firmly planted in HiFi territory and at the same time boldly challenging established boundaries, HiBy Music’s mottos are “Make Music More Musical” and “Ease of Use is Not Optional.”  From button-based entry-level DAPs to touch-operated Android DAPs, we will keep bringing out the best products both in terms of operational fluidity and audio quality.As an established hardware manufacturer, we chose Indiegogo for very specific reasons. Most importantly, it’s a listening tool. Launching a new product by crowdfunding makes progress inseparable from backer support.

<h3><b> Are you an eyeglass wearer?</b></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>VIE SHAIR fits well when wearing eyeglasses or sunglasses. As glass-wearers ourselves, we have found that VIE is more comfortable than typical over-the-ear headphones on the market (which squash your ear with the frame of the glasses). VIE’s open and closed air frames apply minimal pressure. Also, our closed airframe has a soft cushion around its edges. This prevents slippage against the arms of your glasses, and minimizes impact on the passive noise cancellation.</p>

</div></div>","Ultimate ComfortTraditional headphones are painful because they create pressure and generate heat. They’re also subtractive, in that they take you out of your environment, which makes communication difficult and awkward. 
VIE SHAIR’s 3D molded air frame design floats the speaker just off your ear, and is extremely comfortable to wear. You can wear it with less stress and no sweat. It also allows you to interact with your environment while listening to your audio. When you want privacy, the open air frame easily converts to a closed air frame.  
 New sound experience
VIE SHAIR's sound creates totally new sound listening experience. The structure of VIE SHAIR floats the flat  directional speaker off of your ear. The amplifier and bigger low impedance is almost like an external audio system, so powerful and expressive enough to travel farther distance, It results the listening experience is so natural and powerful. You will find a total new aspect of your favorite music. 
Open Air SoundVIE SHAIR's geometric open air frame creates natural and refreshing listening experience. It sounds almost like listening to music coming from the big sound system in open air live environment 
 
Studio SoundYou can experience VIE SHAIR's most powerful sounds with the closed air frame.

VIE is Bluetooth enabled. Its core audio technology comes from Yamaha’s advanced MACH-5 codec, and the large, directional flat speakers provide superior sound quality.

""The Vie Shair wireless headphones use an ""open air"" design that cups around your ear without strongly pressing against it, while still promising strong sound quality and minimal audio leakage for anyone around you."" - Stuff
""Comfort-wise, the headphones delivered on Vie's promise, and feel oddly refreshing to wear compared to my regular over-ear headphones I have on all day at work."" - Mashable
""The Vie Shair headphones feature a unique air frame that relieves pressure on the ears while permitting more environmental awareness."" - Gizmag
""The no-pinch headphones we’ve been waiting for!"" - ChipChick
 
 

 
 

 
 

VIE’s open air frame makes minimal skin contact and permits airflow, making them comfortable and sweat-free, even while exercising. You’ll stay in touch with your surroundings, and will notice when people approach or want to talk with you. And, without removing your headphones or adjusting your audio, you can carry on a normal conversation.
 

 
 

For times when you want to be undisturbed or eliminate unwanted noise, you can swap out the open air frame for the closed air frame. Instant concentration. Instant privacy. Instant peace and quiet.
 
  
 Are you an eyeglass wearer?
 
VIE SHAIR fits well when wearing eyeglasses or sunglasses. As glass-wearers ourselves, we have found that VIE is more comfortable than typical over-the-ear headphones on the market (which squash your ear with the frame of the glasses). VIE’s open and closed air frames apply minimal pressure. Also, our closed airframe has a soft cushion around its edges. This prevents slippage against the arms of your glasses, and minimizes impact on the passive noise cancellation.

 
 

 

 
Enjoy open air, pain-free sound while watching TV or gaming (comfortably!) for hours on end, without disturbing others around you. Hear when your family calls, even with your headphones on. Share video or game audio with your friends using the broadcast function. Wirelessly hook up to audio gadgets, or use the 3.5mm audio input.

 
 
 

Comfortably listen to your favorite tunes or podcast for extended periods of time, without causing ear fatigue. Wear the open air frame to ensure you never miss a call from your boss. Or, switch to the closed air frame for reduced ambient noise and improved concentration.

 

Say goodbye to ill-fitting earbuds and sweaty headphones. VIE is a great solution for active living. The open air frame reduces stress with limited skin contact and lets air circulate freely. Share music and get in tune with a workout buddy. VIE is a safer headphone, because you can hear the outside world while you’re running, biking or exercising. The LED lights add extra visibility for night runs.
 

 

Enjoy a live DJ set in a unique atmosphere. Pump up the bass with the 3-band equalizer. Set the volume to your personal comfort level, and still be able to start a conversation with that interesting person across the floor. Interact with a venue full of people – with music and lights in perfect harmony.

 
 
And more…VIE SHAIR creates new ways to listen to and share your audio. Waiting for your boarding call? Want your children to hear when you call for dinner? Performing a home gig? Taking an ambient yoga session? The ways VIE can fit into your lifestyle are endless.

Crisp and accurate — The thin film diaphragm responds more quickly to changes in the audio. This makes for more life-like sound for things with a fast start or finish, like fingers snapping or a snare drum hit.


Lower power use — The printed circuits in a planar magnetic speaker requires less energy to drive than the wire coils in a dynamic speaker, which helps your battery last longer.


Durable — Dynamic speakers wear down over time, due to the heavier diaphragm and glue which ages. Planar magnetic speakers keep the same beautiful sound profile over time.

Risks and challenges
We have finalized our product design, and it’s ready for mass production. We have a preliminary agreement with our partner and manufacturer YAMAHA who has many years of experience creating high spec audio equipment. That said, there is always the small chance that unexpected changes or issues may arise during execution, resulting in delays or cancellation. In the event of cancellation, we’ll refund your pledge.
Delays or cancellation may arise from: A change in specifications (requested by the operator), or execution by the factory which causes a significant cost increase; Feasibility of local product approval requirements or local import regulations; The event of a natural disaster, such as an earthquake or tsunami.",49.0,1,"4 Campaigns

Almost all earphones on the market with active noise cancellation have to be charged regularly. However, Thunder uses the iPhone’s Lightning connector to draw the power for its active noise cancellation directly from your iPhone. This means you can enjoy active noise cancellation all day long without the hassle of batteries or chargers!
Quiet mode completely blocks out all ambient noise, allowing you to listen to your music and nothing but your music. Despite the powerful noise cancellation, in this mode Thunder only consumes 1% of your iPhone’s battery per hour, meaning you can kick back and relax and not worry about battery levels.Aware mode allows a little ambient noise into your ears, enabling you to remain aware of what’s happening around you. This gives you a superior listening experience but still ensures you’ll still stay safe in traffic and avoid missing out on transport announcements.


 

   Everyone’s listening habits differ, but traditional earphones are tuned with a “one-sound-fits-all”approach. Thunder revolutionizes your listening  experience by adapting itself to your ears and your style.

 
With its complementary app, Thunder tests your hearing in a way similar to a vision test. Listen and answer if you can hear a series of notes played at different frequencies and volumes. Once Thunder obtains your unique hearing signature, the uHear function performs its magic by calibrating Thunder’s sound to you. If your ears can hear it, Thunder will play it!
Thunder’s autoTune function further enhances your listening experience by adapting itself to your playlists. Whether you like bass-thumping club anthems or intimate acoustic singer-songwriter ballads, raucous free jazz trios or reserved string quartets, autoTune listens to your songs to create a curated sound perfect for your playlist.

And if you want to dive in and tune your earphones like a professional acoustic engineer, Thunder’s uTune feature lets you do that too. With adjustable EQ, sound field and surround sound, Thunder has the most comprehensive tuning options available on any earphones, giving you total control.
Regardless of your level of expertise, Thunder gives you a personalized sound that’s yours and yours alone.

 
Original audio from a youtube video of Justin Timblake's Can't Stop the Feeling
 
 
 
  
Due to the inherent limitations of the iPhone’s audio processor, iPhone earphones have always struggled to produce a true high fidelity sound. Thunder solves this problem for good.
 

 
Powered by a genuinely hi-fi audio chip and the iPhone’s Lightning connector, Thunder gives every iPhone user the chance to experience lossless sound for the first time! Prepare to hear everything.
 
Best of all, if you are considering an upgrade to an iPhone 6s Plus or the upcoming iPhone 7, Thunder’s use of the Lightning connector ensures that you will continue to be able to enjoy the best quality sound.
• 1 pair of Thunder Earphones• 1 earphones cushion kit (that has 3 pairs of high-performance silicone tips and 3 pairs of premium memory foam tips sizing from small, medium to large respectively)•1 durable silicone carrying pouch
And you have a choice between chrome silver and chrome black.
 
    


 
 
 We started Thunder because we see the future of a whole new way of listening that utilise the full potential of your existing smart phone and turn it into a listening experience that you've never had before. 
 After almost a year of designing, developing, prototyping, tuning and testing, we are proud to finally present Thunder to you all.
 The next step would be to get ready for mass production. And that is why we need your lovely support to make it happen and put it into the hands of you and many more.
 Together, we can redefine earphones.

You can play with your bare fingers. But, it is much easier to play with our unique drumsticks. I've got to say that it is quite difficult to play with bare fingers for the beginners. Even I couldn't do it. It's about the right vibrations which can not be interrupted when hitting the tongues with your fingers. You must not interrupt (with your finger). That's why I recommend you not to take the risk, and get our drumsticks for beginners.</p>

<p>The Spolum Guide is a device that will help you get started with the drum and teach you some familiar tunes or even some new ones. I have to admit that you can get started very easily even without the Guide. However I felt that it would've helped many people including myself, so I designed and created it. It's a ten-LED system where every tongue has its own light to indicate which petal to hit sequentially to create a melody. It's like a relaxation game, which improves your and your child's motoric activity and develops an exquisite ear for music. All the lights, electronics, and a rechargeable battery are hidden under a special lid. The device can be connected to your smartphone via Bluetooth technology. You can choose your melody and easily control the tempo. </p>

<p>We tried many different coatings and finally, we got inspired by the coating of guns. We discovered that the “bluing” way is the best. It perfectly protects the instrument and it doesn't distort the sound even after quenching. For bluing, we use high-quality exotic oils, which give the drum a beautiful color, shine, and aroma. In this way, the drum won't oxidize. Now this coating is highly modified and the drum is finally covered with resistant varnish. It's still important to take care of the drum with a soft cloth and oil every now and then. It's just doing the drum well. We coat our drums on the inside and the outside surface, and we use high quality precious oil.<br/><strong>New Spolum Drum Painting. </strong>Now we use high quality painting. After increasing the height of The Spolum Drum, the sound became longer and this allowed us to paint the instrument with professional powder coating. It's cool that now you can also paint it yourself with patterns, colors, and easily re-varnish it afterwards, sound resonance duration with additional coverage preserved. It fits children use, and areas with unstable humidity.</p>

<p>With the Spolum Drum Painted  pack you will get a pair of Spolum Drumsticks. This is the last model we have designed. After lots of your feedbacks, tests and investigations of metal, we really tried to enhance and lengthen the sound. The drum turned out to be very special. Now it’s a perfect instrument for meditation, relaxation and healing sessions. The note sound is very long and is as close as possible to the Tibetan singing bowl. You need to play it slowly listening to the sounds how they merge with each other. It’s easy to play with your fingers because of very sensitive petals. You need Drumsticks to play on the street or in a large room, because of the very strong vibrations and fusion of notes. It is good enough for children, since the coating on the drum is a resistant powder coating, which does not require additional care. It is also possible to paint the Drum by yourself with any patterns, sound resonance duration with additional coverage is very high. It is an ideal choice for playing outdoors and for severe operating conditions.</p>

<p>It is handmade of high quality 3 mm thick steel sheet and weighs 10 pounds (4.5 kg), Spolum Drum plays with no additional electronic devices and works with vibration you make when hitting the steel tongues which then reproduce and amplify the sound around the spherical shape of the drum inside, which returns the beautiful sound back to the outside of your surroundings.

<p>You can play it with your fingers, but that requires some experience. However, if you get our special drumsticks, you will hear the beautiful sound with the first hit. You don't need to have any knowledge about playing a muscial instrument; you just need to hit it a few times and then it will goes on and on by itself. From my own experience, I can tell that everyone from your family will play in a completely different style. Their melodies will sound like you would have never expected them to sound - it always surprises everyone. Every time you will hear someone playing, you will say “wow”, because even a person who plays for the first time can surprise you.</p>

<p>That is actually good because you won't know how to do it, you will do it naturally without prejudice and you will create your own, unique music, which will be the best one in the world for you. When you get such feeling, believe me, people around you will love your music as well. And if you're not doing well or you don't like the melodies you make, just get the Guide. The Guide will help you to learn the basics, and it will teach you some familiar melodies. If you don't manage to catch up with the Guide, you can lower the tempo of the Guide. At that moment, when you have played the melody for the 20th time, you will develop a visual memory of how it goes, and you will be familiar with many melody patterns. It's like a game, through which you create a beautiful music.</p>

<p>Yes. If you ask any doctor, you will hear that your psychological health is very important if not the most important part of your overall health condition. If you have ever tried and enjoyed meditation, this instrument is perfect for you. However, if you don't like meditation, you can just place the drum on your lap, and when playing, you will certainly enjoy its pleasant strong vibrations going through your body. And if you put the Spolum Drum on someone else’s back, and you start slowly drumming with one hand, he will start to feel very sensational and pleasant vibrations going through his whole body. After a few minutes of the massage the sensation is so good, he will not want you to stop. I know people who are working in SPA and wellness making a living by performing this type of massage effortlessly on daily basis. If you place 2 or 3 instruments on someone else’s back, and start slowly drumming one by one, there will be three times more pleasure. The sound itself is so beautiful, that people return for this massage to repeat such a unique way of relaxation. If you would like to learn more about healing effectiveness of the Spolum Drum, we suggest you should learn more about the sound and how it affects live organisms. In a nutshell, sound is like a mechanical wave or vibration. It has been proven that vibrations can be destructive or formative! If you take a look into this subject you can learn how to heal your own body with sound. I trully recommend it!</p>

<p>Manufacture of the Drum will take place in an already well-equipped factory. There is also already a  well-coordinated team of professionals in metalworking. An exact number of work hours spent on each instrument was estimated. The Czech Republic is currently one of the largest producers of acoustic pianos in Europe with 150 years of craftsman's tradition in this area. There is an enormous amount of joyful people, who work in a musical industry and are always looking for new ideas in this industry. You may have heard about the worldwide known Petrof brand piano which is produced in the Czech Republic. So this country is not only known for its beautiful architecture, fantastic beer but also for its great musical instruments. It is an ideal place for the birth of your musical instrument. Money that we're raising from this project will be spent on buying materials, not production machines or any other equipment for the factory. That's why we offer a fair price with no extra reselling costs and with top-notch quality.</p>

As you could see in the video, to make a nice melody you don't need any special knowledge or to understand the notes. You can play with your bare fingers. But, it is much easier to play with our unique drumsticks. I've got to say that it is quite difficult to play with bare fingers for the beginners. Even I couldn't do it. It's about the right vibrations which can not be interrupted when hitting the tongues with your fingers. You must not interrupt (with your finger). That's why I recommend you not to take the risk, and get our drumsticks for beginners.


 
The Spolum Guide is a device that will help you get started with the drum and teach you some familiar tunes or even some new ones. I have to admit that you can get started very easily even without the Guide. However I felt that it would've helped many people including myself, so I designed and created it. It's a ten-LED system where every tongue has its own light to indicate which petal to hit sequentially to create a melody. It's like a relaxation game, which improves your and your child's motoric activity and develops an exquisite ear for music. All the lights, electronics, and a rechargeable battery are hidden under a special lid. The device can be connected to your smartphone via Bluetooth technology. You can choose your melody and easily control the tempo. 
 
  
 

            
We tried many different coatings and finally, we got inspired by the coating of guns. We discovered that the “bluing” way is the best. It perfectly protects the instrument and it doesn't distort the sound even after quenching. For bluing, we use high-quality exotic oils, which give the drum a beautiful color, shine, and aroma. In this way, the drum won't oxidize. Now this coating is highly modified and the drum is finally covered with resistant varnish. It's still important to take care of the drum with a soft cloth and oil every now and then. It's just doing the drum well.

It fits children use, and areas with unstable humidity.

We play the best Progressive Rock music of yesterday and today, uninterrupted, 24/7, with no ads and no intrusive jingles or talking. You can find us at morow.com Who are we?Bruno - Bruno started MOROW as a passion project in order to share his love for progressive rock. His talent and experience in radio programming are what gives MOROW its distinctive sound.Arnaud - Having studied Computer Science, Arnaud discovered MOROW in its early stages and has been helping with it ever since. He manages all the technical parts: the website, the app and the servers.Sebastian - Does all the actual work. An intern learning, among other things, project management. He is managing the majority of the campaign, mainly because he’s the only one who speaks good English. Why are we running this campaign?We are free to play only the music that we love, but it comes at a cost. We’ve asked for your help once before, and the “Help MOROW” campaign we ran was a resounding success.That was three years ago.Today we come to you again with a request, and an idea. The money you helped us obtain in 2014 has enabled us to survive this long, but has since dried up and we need more contributions to stay alive.However, we see this as a challenge, an opportunity to drive MOROW forward together.We thought about how we could offer you something you would be willing to contribute monthly towards. And we think we’ve found the solution. MOROW+We have started development of new iOS and Android apps, and of a new functionality that will tailor the program to fit your tastes. Upon registering as a MOROW+ user, each one of you will have access to your own individualized MOROW stream, with only music you like. Every MOROW+ stream will keep that distinctive MOROW sound, curated by Bruno, but will be influenced by your preferences while still offering you new and exciting titles to discover. The specifics are complicated but the idea is simple:to let you have the best listening experience possible while sustaining your favourite web radio.We love MOROW just the way it is, and we know you do too, which is why the challenge for us was thinking up a new way of listening to music while keeping everything that makes MOROW great.MOROW+ is a personalized radio, not an on-demand platform like Spotify. As an extra feature, it is not mandatory; you can keep listening to MOROW as usual.But going back to a non-personalized stream will be difficult once you have experienced MOROW+ !This new functionality will let you experience MOROW the way it was always meant to be. In fact, MOROW was created with this in mind: MOROW is an acronym of My Own Radio On Web.Back in 2000 the functionality was not feasible, only now do we have a chance at implementing what we believe to be the next step in a 17 year long journey of musical excellence.To accomplish this, we need you.While the updated website and original iOS app have already been released, we need funds to continue development and keep them up and running.This is the only way for MOROW to thrive and keep offering you your favourite music. What we needWe need 9000€ to accomplish all this.34% (~3000€) of that will go to keeping the website and app up and running for two years.16% (~1500€) will go to finishing the development of the website and application.38% (~3400€) will be used to fulfil rewards.10% (~900€) is taken by Indiegogo and credit card fees.2% (~200€) is set aside for now in case of unexpected circumstances.Since we have selected the flexible funding option, we get to keep the money even if the goal is not met. If we don’t reach the minimum, you can count on us to do what is best for MOROW.If we exceed the funding goal (preferable) we will be able to accomplish everything we have set out to do and more. We have plenty of ideas on how to make MOROW better! What you getOur undying love and affection. … Oh, and some rewards:To add any item to your reward, you can contribute the required amount via the ""Back it"" button at the top of the page and send us a direct message via the ""Ask a question"" button (also at the top of the page) detailing what it is you want.For example if you want an X-Large Sweatshirt to go with your MOROW t-shirt, press ""Back it"", enter 60€ as your donation amount, confirm, and then send us a message saying you want an X-Large sweatshirt.

This headphone does not give many of the pains that people often have after wearing one for a long time."" -- Techlector SHIVR’s own advanced algorithm can effectively enhances audio surround sound and sense of space, allowing the listener to accurately sense sound from different sources. Traditional two-channel audio only delivers sound from the left and right side, but in real life we can identify sounds from various directions, distances and the surrounding environment. Real sounds mix as they bounce off walls, floors, and ceilings, and gives us a feel of room size and the materials within it.We use a gyroscope technology-based 3D audio algorithm to achieve 3D spatial sound.1. The algorithm deconstructs the sounds from difference sources and rebuilds them in an environment simulator, to determine directions, distances and reflected surface data of the sound.2.Head tracking tech keeps the sound locked in position no matter what movements you make with your head.3.We use HRTF(Head related transfer function) to detect your anatomy such as ear shape, head size, and shoulder size. It then rebuilds the sound to best adapt to your body. In addition, our HPTF technology can compensate the rebuilt audio with more layered details instead of simple EQ adjustments. What Users Are Saying About SHIVRWe let people try SHIVR for the first time to gain real world feedback on the 3D and audio performance. Most active noise cancelling (ANC) headphones use only one mic to pick up and process the ambient noise. But SHIVR includes both feedforward and feedback mics. This more advanced measurement of sound provides the best noise-free experience in any environment.Along with advances in hardware, we developed an ANC algorithm that is customized for SHIVR to deliver even better noise cancellation results. It resulted from various tests on acoustic engineering, components’ size & material, speaker & drive implementation, etc. Compared to traditional solutions, it's substantially more flexible and effective in ANC performance. In addition, the ANC algorithm can better detect noisy environments and calibrate filter parameters to deliver the best performance. Digial ANC Algorithm Calibrates to Various Environments

 
 Take a look at the full beta version SHIVR with ANC and 3D effect on. 

 

 


We designed SHIVR for long-term, comfortable use so you can enjoy binge-watching movies or competing with your teammates in the virtual reality world non-stop. Our 3D algorithm is based on a built-in gyroscope to not only create immersive 3D surround sound, but also to perfectly calibrate to each user’s ear to eliminate in-the-head localization effects. The listener won’t feel dizzy or tired even after long listening sessions.

 
We scanned and analyzed hundreds of human ears and head shape with multiple mockups to guarantee a secure, comfortable fit for every user. The headband is made of TR90 titanium which is durable and lightweight. The ear pads feature high quality memory foam covered by skin-friendly protein leather.
Nothing sounds better to your ear than a crystal clear sound. Our DSP process creates high fidelity audio that your ears will never get tired listening too.  SHIVR features a premium φ40mm Bionic Stereo Driver to deliver a rich and more accurate sound. This Bionic Stereo Driver is custom designed to fit in the independent acoustic chamber inside SHIVR.  The membrane inside the driver can vibrate with less power consumption while creating more natural sound so you can distinguish the highest tweets and the lowest bass.SHIVR’s acoustic team is led by acoustic experts who have previously worked for JBL, AKG, Panasonic, Pioneer, and other audio leaders. The acoustic structure is designed by veterans who worked for big names like Beats by Dre and Panasonic. The team has a proven record producing world leading audio devices from start to finish.SHIVR supports aptX technology to elevate your Bluetooth listening experience to the highest audiophile level. aptX is a codec necessary to achieve high fidelity wireless music. aptX is a superior compression/decompression protocol that reduces latency and provides the best audio with low battery consumption. One issue with noise cancelling headphones is that after the ambient noise is removed, it may cause loss in the audio signal. We worked with YAMAHA audio lab to provide a compensation signal to the feed-backward noise prediction. So you will hear the music noise-free without quality loss. SHIVR uses Bluetooth 4.2 technology to ensure a stable connection. You can enjoy seamless music streaming even when you aren’t close to your music source with SHIVR’s improved wireless range of 49 feet (15 meters)Turn on ambient sound mode to hear your immediate environment to detect any danger when walking/ riding.

acting like a conventional single-effect stompbox.</p><h3>Audio Routing</h3><p>The C99 has the ability to record audio from your guitar and send it to your computer (computer, laptop, tablet, or phone) in real time via USB audio and can also play audio from your computer allowing the C99 to act as a sound card while using your effects -

PRE LOW-CUT</u>:  Reduces the bass (response before clipping) for each preamp stage.  Use this control to loosen or tighten up the amp's bass response.</p><p><u>PREAMP - STAGE GAIN</u>:  The amount of signal gain for each stage.  Maxed out this preamp has tone of gain!</p><p><u>PREAMP - MID-EMPHASIS</u>:  Emphasizes the mid-range response of each preamp stage.  This control cascades the mid-range gain of the increasingly distorted guitar signal resulting in a brassy overdriven sound.  Use the tone-stack's middle frequency control to cut the midrange for a great classic hard rock sound.</p><p><u>PREAMP - EMPHASIS FREQ</u>:  Adjust the center frequency of the mid-emphasis control.</p><p><u>PREAMP - POST HIGH-CUT</u>:  Reduces the treble after the last preamp stage, similar to a tone control on an effects pedal.</p><p>The <strong>tone block</strong> consist of a three-band semi-parametric equalizer with adjustable EQ gain and frequency settings with the filter Q being adjusted automatically to result in a smooth and natural frequency response shape for adjacent EQ bands.  The tone stack operates primarily on the lower, middle, and upper midrange frequencies.  Therefore the preamp's 'PRE LOW-CUT' and 'POST HIGH-CUT' controls are used to adjust the bass and treble levels.</p><p><u>TONE - LOWER GAIN/FREQUENCY</u>:  Adjusts the gain and the frequency of the semi-parametric EQ for the lower frequencies (lower-midrange).  The Q is adjusted automatically per the lower EQ and the middle EQ settings.</p><p><u>TONE - MIDDLE GAIN/FREQUENCY</u>:  Adjusts the gain and the frequency of the semi-parametric EQ for the mid-range frequencies (middle mid-range).  The Q is adjusted automatically per the lower EQ, middle EQ, and the upper EQ settings.</p><p><u>TONE - UPPER GAIN/FREQUENCY</u>:  Adjusts the gain and the frequency of the semi-parametric EQ for the upper frequencies (upper midrange).  The Q is adjusted automatically per the middle EQ and the upper EQ settings.</p><p>The <strong>delay block</strong> consists of eight delay lines each with their own own delay line lengths and modulation frequency oscillator (LFO).  The number of delays is selectable and the delay length and LFO rates are adjusted automatically as you adjust the common delay time, rate, and depth parameters.  Using a single delay allows for a standard flanger or chorus.  Increasing the delay count results in thick and lush chorus, while maxing out the delay count to eight and increasing the feedback results in smooth reverb.</p><p><u>DELAY - COUNT</u>:  Sets the number of delay lines to use, 0 (none) through 8.</p><p><u>DELAY - TIME</u>:  Sets the base delay time for delay line #1 (0 to 42 milliseconds).  Delay lines #2 and beyond are adjusted automatically to have a similar but delay length that is related to the other delay lengths (yet unique in actual length) in a 'musical' way.</p><p><u>DELAY - MOD RATE</u>:  Sets the delay time modulation frequency for delay line #1 (0 Hz to 3 Hz).  Modulation frequencies for delay #2 and beyond are adjusted automatically to have similar/unique modulation frequencies.</p><p><u>DELAY - MOD DEPTH</u>:  Sets the delay time modulation depth for delay line #1 (0 % to 10%).  Modulation depths for delay #2 and beyond are adjusted automatically to have similar/unique modulation depths.</p><p><u>DELAY - FEEDBACK</u>:  Adjusts the amount of delayed signal that is fed back into the delay line.  Moderate feedback with short delay times result in flanging.  Low to no feedback with moderate to high delay times result in chorus.  High feedback with long delay time and high delay count results in reverb.</p><p><u>DELAY - DAMPING</u>:  Reduces the high frequencies of the delay line for dry as well as wet/feedback signals.  Use this to reduce the brightness of delay effects - especially for reverb where feedback is set to high levels.</p><p><u>DELAY - INTENSITY</u>:  Adjusts the ratio of dry signal to wet/delayed signal as well as selects the delay network type (one delay, two delays, four delays, or eight delays).  One delay results in a more prominent flanger/chorus effect while eight delays results in smoother reverberation.  Two and four delays result in blended chorus/delay and modulated reverb effects.</p><p>The <strong>output block</strong> controls the effect chain's output volume and the cabinet impulse response selection.  Since these parameter are included in the effects presets the overall volume and cabinet selection chain can be adjusted per preset.</p><p><u>OUTPUT - VOLUME</u>:  Adjusts the output volume before being altered by the master volume (VOL) knob.</p><p><u>OUTPUT - CABINET</u>:  Selects which authentic Celestion speaker/cabinet impulse response is used - ranges from 0 (off) to 9 (nine impulse responses).</p><h3>Impulse Responses</h3><p>The guitar speaker and cabinet have a significant effect on the overall sound of the guitar and effects chain.  Using impulse responses allow a speaker's frequency response, as well as its reverberation characteristics, be applied to the audio signal to replicate its effect.  This is useful for setups that do not include a conventional guitar amplifier and speaker/cabinet such as PA systems or that use of powered studio monitors.  In fact it's possible to sound much like a guitar amp setup with a guitar amp.  This is especially useful when using the C99 as your computer's record and play-back audio device allowing the C99 to act as your instrument-to-computer recording interface, your sound-card for music playback, and your multi-effects unit ... all with one compact device!</p><p>The C99 contains the following authentic Celestion speaker impulse responses built-in:</p><ul>

THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO MAKE OUR DREAM COME TRUE !!!</strong></p></div>","=> INTRODUCING MARQUEE MK1 PREMIUM SPEAKER <=Today it is hard to find speakers that sounds and look good for a decent price. Most of the commercial speakers looks almost the same - they follow same trend and they produce sound pumped with too much bass...Everything wrapped in cheap plastic that lack ""soul"" and performance when comparing to the speakers that were built during sound engineering revolution when every system was unique in its own way.That is why we've decided to build something that would bring back experience we know from our childhood times and we've created MARQUEE MK 1 Speaker. => WHAT IS MARQUEE MK1 SPEAKER? <=Each MARQUEE MK 1 Speaker is a handcrafted piece of woodworking and engineering art that is unique in its own way. Because each speaker is handmade, you will never see the same looking Marquee MK1 out there! We always make sure that it sounds the same, but difference in wood grain pattern makes it a truly unique piece of art!We choose our audio equipment carefully and we've spend last 5 years designing and testing different setups and audio parts to create something that sounds the way we want. You will never hear anything even close in mass produced commercial audio systems. Clear, warm and well balanced sound gives us hope, that once you will listen to your favorite music from MARQUEE MK 1 speaker, you will never want to go back to any other audio systems... => FEATURED IN <= => SPECIFICATIONS: <=Each ROA Marquee MK1 speaker is equipped with two HIGH QUALITY 3"" DRIVERS, NEODYMIUM TWEETER and 6"" SUBWOOFER to deliver true full range spectrum sound without missing anything in between.Drivers are placed and tuned in separate chambers so they do not interfere with each other so there is no distortion and PORTED design of the chambers is producing deep high quality sound.Marquee MK 1 also features build in amplifier with Bluetooth 4.0 module equipped with aptX technology. AptX™ audio enhances the wireless sound quality of many of the world’s finest smartphones, speakers, soundbars, headphones and tablets. With aptX, music lovers can enjoy wired quality sound - wirelessly. Leading manufacturers such as Sony, Samsung, Vizio and Panasonic use aptX to build Bluetooth® products, and support high quality sound. SPECS : - Handcrafted Real Wood Speaker- Built-In 6"" Sub-woofer with Neodymium Magnet- Powerful Amplifier with Dedicated Sub-woofer channel- Long Range Bluetooth 4.0 [external antenna]- AptX technology (CD Like Wireless Audio)- Hi-Fi Sound Quality - TPA3116 Class D amplifier chip- Unique Design- Neodymium Tweeter- 2x Bamboo Fiber Cone High Quality Drivers- AUX-in- RCA-in  => SPEAKER DIMENSIONS: <=WIDE - 13 3/4""DEEP - 11 1/4""HEIGHT - 6 3/4""WEIGHT - 12 lb => SUBWOOFER <=To fully cover low frequencies, we've decided to put 6"" subwoofer at the bottom of the speaker to distribute BASS in 360 degrees. Equipped with large Neodymium magnet and flat woven glass-fiber/honeycomb aluminum composite cone, this subwoofer produces frequency response to fill your room with more then enough bass without destroying the balance between the rest of the drivers... => DESIGN <=When we were thinking about design, we've wanted MARQUEE MK 1 to be a premium speaker that would blend perfectly into your home and that was our main mission. It will be perfect addition to your Bedroom / Office or Living Room that will turn into real cinema experience room!We use only top quality & selected Red Oak wood for our Marquee MK speakers! => UNIVERSAL AUDIO SYSTEM <=Our idea is to create a new generation of audio system that will be universal in use and design. You can use MARQUEE MK1 while watching Movies - will turn your TV in your living room into Cinema.Or you can use it as a BLUETOOTH SPEAKER when you want to listen to your favorite music in your Bedroom before going to sleep. Or connect it to your console while playing games for immersive gaming experience! There are unlimited possibilities what you can do with MARQUEE MK1! => TIMELINE <=When we were creating our CAMPAIGN TIMELINE, we made sure to take additional time for each of our steps in order to give you ""REAL"" and Reliable time frames if it comes to our production and your order Fulfillment.

grâce aux technologies actuelles, il est enfin possible de réunir les 'puristes' du son analogique et les 'geeks' de l'ère numérique :<br/>
- avec la qualité analogique: dynamique, définition, chaleur...<br/>
- et le côté pratique du numérique: fiabilité, reproductibilité, insensibilité aux parasites</em></p><em>
<p>Si l'expérience sonore/musicale est l'une des plus intéressante sur terre, c'est aussi l'une des plus subjective et personnelle; Dès qu'il est question d'audio et de musique, on parle de ressenti, d'émotions, de sentiments (j'aime/j'aime pas): bref, des choses difficilement quantifiables en termes techniques... <br/>
Au final, l'important c'est le résultat !</p>
<p>Or l'arrivée des technologies numériques a bouleversé non seulement la façon d'écouter de la musique, mais elle a également transformé la manière de la 'concevoir' et de la distribuer; si cela apporte des améliorations non négligeables dans beaucoup de cas, il faut admettre que pour l'auditeur 'final' les dernières décennies ont plutôt privilégiées la compression et l'optimisation des données (internet/streaming oblige!) au détriment de la qualité...<br/>
Mais après tout, pourquoi les nouvelles/futures générations devraient se contenter d'un son basse-résolution, compressé, encodé, décimé…?<br/>
Aussi, les 'nostalgiques' du son analogique y trouveront leur compte, puisqu'ils retrouveront la définition perdue avec les débuts de l'ère digitale...</p>
<font color=""blue"">1/ why?<br/>
using current technologies, it is now possible to gather the analog-sound 'purists' and the geeks of the digital age :<br/>
- with analog quality : dynamic definition, warmth ...<br/>
- and the convenience of digital reliability, reproducibility, interference immunity<br/></font><p><font color=""blue""></font></p>
<p><font color=""blue"">
If the sound/music experience is one of the most interesting on earth, it is also one of the most subjective and personal; when talk about audio and music, talking about feelings, of emotions, feelings (I like/I do not): in short, not easily quantifiable things in technical terms...<br/>
In the end, what matters is the result !<br/></font></p>
<font color=""blue"">
</font><p><font color=""blue"">But the advent of digital technology has revolutionized not only the way of listening to music, but it has also transformed the way to 'make' and distribute it, if it brings significant improvements in many cases, note that for the end listener, recent decades have rather preferred compression and optimization data (because of  internet/streaming) at the expense of quality ...<br/>
But after all, why the new/future generations should settle for a low-resolution sound, compressed, encoded, decimated ... ? <br/>
Also, the 'nostalgic' of analog audio will find their account, they re-find the definition lost with the beginning of the digital age ...<br/></font></p>
<p>2/ comment ?<br/> grâce à la technologie <a href=""http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Stream_Digital"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DSD 'Direct Stream Digital'</a> ou 'Delta-Sigma Direct' qui permet de s'affranchir des limites imposées par le format PCM 'Pulse Code Modulation' et dérivés (.wav, AAC, CD...etc) associée à un support média de type carte mémoire SD: d'où le nom de code D[SD].<br/>
DSD est un procédé de stockage de signaux audio sur un média numérique utilisé par Sony et Philips dans les années 1990 d'abord à des fins d'archivage puis commercialisé avec le format SA-CD. Bien que le résultat de ce procédé soit un flux numérique haute-fréquence composé de 0 et de 1, celui-ci se rapproche clairement du signal analogique original.</p>

DSD is a method of storing audio signals on digital media used by Sony and Philips in the 1990s first for the purpose of archiving then commercialized with the SA-CD format. Although the result of this process is a digital high-frequency streams compound of 0 and 1, this is clearly closer to the original analog signal.

<p> Par analogie, cette modulation de largeur d'impulsion ou modulation de densité d’impulsions s’apparente un peu à la Pré-magnétisation HF ou Polarisation qui existait sur les 'antiques' magnétophones à bandes…<br/>
Ce procédé permet d’obtenir des performances dynamiques largement supérieures à tout autre format : 120 dB sur toute la bande passante utile.<br/>
De plus, par rapport aux formats de type PCM, le format DSD permet de s’affranchir des épineux problèmes de décimation et d’interpolation… sans compter les inconvénients résultants de 'Jitter' d’horloge et autres latences liées aux buffers/corrections d’erreurs critiques en PCM.</p>
<p><font color=""blue"">
By analogy, this pulse width modulation or pulse density modulation is a bit like the HF pre-magnetization or polarization that existed on the 'vintage' magnetic tape recorders... <br/>
This method provides dynamic performance far above any other format: 120 dB on all the useful frequency range. <br/>
In addition, compared to PCM formats, DSD format allows to overcome difficult problems of decimation and interpolation ... not to mention the resulting disadvantages of 'Jitter' clock and other latencies related buffers/errors-corrections 'critical' in PCM.

<p>Une tentative de commercialisation de ce format a été faite avec le Super Audio CD, dont l'objectif était de succéder au Compact Disc : celui-ci comportant un certain nombre de défauts inhérents à sa technologie datant de la fin des années 1970.<br/>
Malheureusement, alors que sa qualité est reconnue par les audiophiles, le SA-CD a été un échec commercial pour plusieurs raisons : l’une d’elle étant probablement que ce support n’apportait pas vraiment de valeur ajoutée à l’auditeur ‘normal’ par rapport au CD…</p>Aujourd’hui, le contexte a changé et de nouvelles solutions/technologies sont apparues : augmentation des capacités de calcul, démocratisation des mémoires flash, composants électroniques toujours plus performants… mais en fin de compte, l’auditeur final n’a toujours pas profité de ces avancées.<p></p>
<p>La ‘dématérialisation’ de la musique est actuellement à la mode mais elle comporte également quelques inconvénients : elle nécessite de disposer d'un ordinateur (et savoir s’en servir), ensuite d’avoir un matériel adapté et enfin les formats (liés au téléchargement/streaming) évoluent sans cesse et sont très souvent encodés/compressés…<br/>
L’usage de plusieurs méthodes d’écoute n’est pas incompatible et peut même être complémentaire :<br/>
- streaming pour écoute de type 'radio'<br/>
- téléchargement/achat/support physique pour écoute Hi-Fi haute définition D[SD]
</p>
<p>Quant à l’utilisation de cartes mémoires type SD, celles-ci comportent de nombreux avantages par rapport aux supports de type optique (CD, DVD, Blu-ray) :<br/>
- plus de problèmes mécaniques : usure, poussière, rayures, traces de doigt, etc…<br/>
- électroniques : complexité, usure laser, correction d'erreurs, mémoire tampon, horloge, etc…<br/>
- longévité, insensibilité aux conditions climatiques<br/>
- très peu de maintenance<br/>
- technologie actuelle (21ème siècle) et mature<br/>
De plus, un système de protection de Copyright est prévu d’origine dans le format SD : Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM).
</p>
<p>
Aussi, les avantages par rapport aux DACs USB qui apparaissent actuellement sont indéniables :<br/>
-fonctionnement autonome, pas besoin d’ordinateur PC/Mac<br/>
- pas de problèmes liés à l’interface USB : connexion, stabilité, synchro, drivers, players, etc…<br/>
- fonctionnement absolument silencieux (pas de pièces mécaniques, ventilateurs, etc)<br/>
- vrai support physique, robuste, fiable et performant</p>
<p><font color=""blue"">
An attempt to commercialize this format was made with the Super Audio CD, whose objective was to succeed the Compact Disc: one with a number of defects inherent in its technology from the late 1970s.<br/>
Unfortunately, while its quality is recognized by audiophiles, the SA- CD was a commercial failure for several reasons, one of which is probably that this format does not really brought value to the 'normal' listener relative to the CD...<br/>

Today, the situation has changed and new solutions/technologies have emerged : computing capacity increased, flash memory democratization, ever more powerful electronic components... but ultimately, the final auditor has not benefited these advances .<br/>

The 'dematerialization' of music is currently fashionable but it also has some drawbacks: it requires to have a computer (and know how to use) , then have a suitable device and finally the formats (related to download/streaming) are constantly changing and are often encoded/compressed ...<br/>
The use of several methods of listening is not incompatible and may even be complementary :<br/>
- listening to streaming 'radio'<br/>
- download/purchase/physical support for Hi-Fi listening HD D[SD]<br/>

As for the use of SD memory cards types, they have many advantages over optical media type (CD, DVD, Blu-ray) :<br/>
- no more mechanical problems wear, dust, scratches, fingerprints, etc ...<br/>
- electronic : complexity, laser wear, error correction, buffer, clock, etc ...<br/>
- longevity, insensitivity to weather conditions<br/>
- very little maintenance<br/>
- current technology (21st century) and mature<br/>
In addition, a system of protection of Copyright origin is provided in the SD format : Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM). <br/>

Also, the advantages over USB DACs that currently appear are undeniable :<br/>
- standalone operation, no computer required PC/Mac<br/>
- no problems with the USB interface connection, stability, synchronization, drivers, players, etc ...<br/>
- absolutely silent operation (no mechanical parts, fans, etc.)<br/>
- real physical support, robust, reliable and efficient<br/></font></p>
<p>3/ quand ?<br/>
pour l'instant, du fait du peu d'outils d'enregistrement/édition adaptés, et à part certains SA-CD, un petit nombre d'enregistrements proposent une résolution 'DSD native'; Cependant, en attendant le tout-DSD, la conversion de formats PCM de très haute qualité (24bits/192kHz ou supérieur) au format DSD permettra d'obtenir dans un premier temps une qualité compatible avec les exigences de la haute-fidélité.<br/>
Aussi, si la demande est là, nul doute que l'industrie musicale saura s'adapter afin de proposer de vrais 'DSD'...
</p>
<p><font color=""blue"">
3/ when?<br/>
at this time, because of the few adapted recording/editing tools , and with the exception of some SA-CD, a small number of records can offer a resolution 'native DSD'; However, waiting for the all–DSD, the conversion of high quality PCM formats (24bits/192kHz or higher) to DSD will provide initially a quality suitable for the requirements of high-fidelity…<br/>
Also, if the demand is there, no doubt the music industry will adapt in order to provide real 'DSD' ...
</font></p>
<p></p><h3>Enjeux et perspectives  
<font color=""blue"">- Issues and Prospects
</font>
</h3><p></p>
<p>Le but visé est l’amélioration globale de la qualité audio objective : définition, dynamique, distorsion, bande passante, spatialisation… afin de laisser s’exprimer la Musique !<br/>
Et le contexte actuel étant ce qu’il est, plusieurs aspects sont à prendre en compte :<br/><font color=""blue"">The goal is the overall improvement in the objective audio quality : definition, dynamic, distortion, bandwidth, spatialisation... to let them express the Music!<br/>
And the current situation being what it is, several aspects should be taken into account :
</font></p>
<ul><li>	Epoque 'post-CD' :</li></ul><p>
L’ère du CD touche à sa fin et un nouveau modèle économique est donc à réinventer…<br/>
Actuellement on a le choix entre un modèle de type totalement dématérialisé par internet (téléchargement ou streaming) et un modèle de distribution classique de médias physiques : DVD-A, Blu-ray Pure Audio, (SD-ROM… ?)<br/>
Mais pourquoi pas imaginer un modèle 'hybride' de téléchargement HD associé à un support !? : certains sites spécialisés proposent d’ores et déjà des fichiers haute-qualité « Studio-Masters »…<br/>
Il suffira alors de copier ces fichiers .DSF ou .DSD sur une carte SD et on aura l’équivalent d’un CD 'gravé' mais avec la qualité d’un SA-CD (mais sans les problèmes mécaniques/optiques)…<br/>
Les 2 modèles peuvent en effet co-exister :<br/>
- téléchargement + mémoire flash (équivalent de l’actuel CD-RW 'réinscriptible')<br/>
- support physique avec mémoire de type ROM (idem CD pressé) + 'D[SD]pack' (packaging personnalisé/créatif)
</p>
<ul><font color=""blue""><li> ‘post – CD’ time :</li></font></ul><p><font color=""blue"">
The CD’s time coming to end and a new economic model is to reinventing ...<br/>
Currently there is a choice between a model type completely dematerialized by internet (download or streaming) and a classical distribution model of physical media : DVD-A, Pure Audio Blu-ray, (SD-ROM ... ? )<br/>
But why not imagine a 'hybrid' model of HD download associated with a support ? : Some specialty sites already offer high-quality files ""Studio-Masters"" ...<br/>
So, it just copy these files .DSF or .DSD on an SD card and we will have the equivalent of a CD 'engraved' but with the quality of a SA-CD (but without the mechanical/optical problems) ...<br/>
The two models can indeed co-exist :<br/>
- download + flash memory (equivalent to the current CD-RW)<br/>
- physical medium with a ROM type memory (as CD pressed) + 'D[SD]pack' (custom/creative packaging)<br/></font></p>
<p>Exemples de D[SD]pack :<br/><font color=""blue"">D[SD]pack examples:

<p>Pour information, voici un comparatif de la taille mémoire occupée en fonction de différents formats pour une piste de musique classique d’environ 10 minutes :<br/><font color=""blue"">For information, here is a comparison of the memory occupied according to various formats for classical music track about 10 minutes:

<p></p>
<p>On peut remarquer que le format DSD64 (non compressé) occupe moins d’espace que le format PCM24/192 (compression FLAC) et le DSD128 pèse presque deux fois moins lourd que son équivalent PCM (DXD)…<br/>
Une carte mémoire de 4Go suffirait pour stocker environ 74 minutes de musique (soit l’équivalent d’un CD) en très haute définition DSD128 non compressé.<br/>
Peu utilisée pour l’instant, la technologie de compression sans pertes DST (Direct Stream Transfer) permettra de réduire la taille occupée d’un facteur compris entre 2 et 3 (standard MPEG-4 Audio).<br/><font color=""blue"">It may be noted that the DSD64 size (uncompressed) occupies less space than the size PCM24/192 (FLAC compression) and DSD128 weighs almost two times lighter than its equivalent PCM (DXD)...<br/>
A memory card of 4GB is enough to store about 74 minutes of music (equivalent of a CD) in high definition uncompressed DSD128.<br/>
Little used so far, the technology lossless compression DST (Direct Stream Transfer) will reduce the size occupied by a factor of between 2 and 3 (standard MPEG-4 Audio).
</font></p>
<ul><li>	Fin de la 'guerre du volume' :</li></ul><p>
Depuis plusieurs années, les mélomanes avertis constatent une perte de qualité au niveau dynamique. En effet, encouragées par les auditeurs/consommateurs, certaines maisons de disque/producteurs ont participé à une course au volume sonore et cette demande ""je veux que mon disque sonne plus fort que celui de machin"" a abouti à des aberrations telle que la 'loudness war' (lien wiki)<br/>

L'arrivée d'un nouveau format permettrait de définir/normaliser la dynamique des programmes et enregistrements musicaux.<br/>

Comme amélioration, on peut imaginer des métadonnées contenues dans les fichiers permettant au lecteur d'auto-régler son volume afin d'homogénéiser les différences de niveaux d'écoute en fonction des D[SD] insérés…
Dans une perspective d’évolution, on peut aussi imaginer un processeur intégré qui adapte la dynamique des enregistrements en fonction du niveau de bruit environnant.
</p>
<ul><font color=""blue""><li> End of the 'Loudness War' :</li></font></ul><p><font color=""blue"">

PRESENTATIONLe lecteur musical haute-résolution D[SD] AudioFEEL [d-play] en 3 questions :  The high-resolution D[SD] music player AudioFEEL [d-play] in 3 questions : 1/ pourquoi ?
grâce aux technologies actuelles, il est enfin possible de réunir les 'puristes' du son analogique et les 'geeks' de l'ère numérique :
- avec la qualité analogique: dynamique, définition, chaleur...
- et le côté pratique du numérique: fiabilité, reproductibilité, insensibilité aux parasites
Si l'expérience sonore/musicale est l'une des plus intéressante sur terre, c'est aussi l'une des plus subjective et personnelle; Dès qu'il est question d'audio et de musique, on parle de ressenti, d'émotions, de sentiments (j'aime/j'aime pas): bref, des choses difficilement quantifiables en termes techniques... 
Au final, l'important c'est le résultat !
Or l'arrivée des technologies numériques a bouleversé non seulement la façon d'écouter de la musique, mais elle a également transformé la manière de la 'concevoir' et de la distribuer; si cela apporte des améliorations non négligeables dans beaucoup de cas, il faut admettre que pour l'auditeur 'final' les dernières décennies ont plutôt privilégiées la compression et l'optimisation des données (internet/streaming oblige!) au détriment de la qualité...
Mais après tout, pourquoi les nouvelles/futures générations devraient se contenter d'un son basse-résolution, compressé, encodé, décimé…?
Aussi, les 'nostalgiques' du son analogique y trouveront leur compte, puisqu'ils retrouveront la définition perdue avec les débuts de l'ère digitale...
1/ why?
using current technologies, it is now possible to gather the analog-sound 'purists' and the geeks of the digital age :
- with analog quality : dynamic definition, warmth ...
- and the convenience of digital reliability, reproducibility, interference immunity

If the sound/music experience is one of the most interesting on earth, it is also one of the most subjective and personal; when talk about audio and music, talking about feelings, of emotions, feelings (I like/I do not): in short, not easily quantifiable things in technical terms...
In the end, what matters is the result !

But the advent of digital technology has revolutionized not only the way of listening to music, but it has also transformed the way to 'make' and distribute it, if it brings significant improvements in many cases, note that for the end listener, recent decades have rather preferred compression and optimization data (because of  internet/streaming) at the expense of quality ...
But after all, why the new/future generations should settle for a low-resolution sound, compressed, encoded, decimated ... ? 
Also, the 'nostalgic' of analog audio will find their account, they re-find the definition lost with the beginning of the digital age ...
2/ comment ? grâce à la technologie DSD 'Direct Stream Digital' ou 'Delta-Sigma Direct' qui permet de s'affranchir des limites imposées par le format PCM 'Pulse Code Modulation' et dérivés (.wav, AAC, CD...etc) associée à un support média de type carte mémoire SD: d'où le nom de code D[SD].
DSD est un procédé de stockage de signaux audio sur un média numérique utilisé par Sony et Philips dans les années 1990 d'abord à des fins d'archivage puis commercialisé avec le format SA-CD. Bien que le résultat de ce procédé soit un flux numérique haute-fréquence composé de 0 et de 1, celui-ci se rapproche clairement du signal analogique original.
2/ how ?
thanks to technology DSD 'Direct Stream Digital' or 'Delta-Sigma Direct' which overcomes the limitations imposed by the PCM 'Pulse Code Modulation' and derivatives ( .wav , AAC, CD ... etc. ) associated to a SD memory card media Type: whence codename D[SD].
DSD is a method of storing audio signals on digital media used by Sony and Philips in the 1990s first for the purpose of archiving then commercialized with the SA-CD format. Although the result of this process is a digital high-frequency streams compound of 0 and 1, this is clearly closer to the original analog signal.


 Par analogie, cette modulation de largeur d'impulsion ou modulation de densité d’impulsions s’apparente un peu à la Pré-magnétisation HF ou Polarisation qui existait sur les 'antiques' magnétophones à bandes…
Ce procédé permet d’obtenir des performances dynamiques largement supérieures à tout autre format : 120 dB sur toute la bande passante utile.
De plus, par rapport aux formats de type PCM, le format DSD permet de s’affranchir des épineux problèmes de décimation et d’interpolation… sans compter les inconvénients résultants de 'Jitter' d’horloge et autres latences liées aux buffers/corrections d’erreurs critiques en PCM.

By analogy, this pulse width modulation or pulse density modulation is a bit like the HF pre-magnetization or polarization that existed on the 'vintage' magnetic tape recorders... 
This method provides dynamic performance far above any other format: 120 dB on all the useful frequency range. 
In addition, compared to PCM formats, DSD format allows to overcome difficult problems of decimation and interpolation ... not to mention the resulting disadvantages of 'Jitter' clock and other latencies related buffers/errors-corrections 'critical' in PCM. 


Comparatif des topologies PCM / DSD :Comparison of PCM / DSD topologies:

Une tentative de commercialisation de ce format a été faite avec le Super Audio CD, dont l'objectif était de succéder au Compact Disc : celui-ci comportant un certain nombre de défauts inhérents à sa technologie datant de la fin des années 1970.
Malheureusement, alors que sa qualité est reconnue par les audiophiles, le SA-CD a été un échec commercial pour plusieurs raisons : l’une d’elle étant probablement que ce support n’apportait pas vraiment de valeur ajoutée à l’auditeur ‘normal’ par rapport au CD…Aujourd’hui, le contexte a changé et de nouvelles solutions/technologies sont apparues : augmentation des capacités de calcul, démocratisation des mémoires flash, composants électroniques toujours plus performants… mais en fin de compte, l’auditeur final n’a toujours pas profité de ces avancées.
La ‘dématérialisation’ de la musique est actuellement à la mode mais elle comporte également quelques inconvénients : elle nécessite de disposer d'un ordinateur (et savoir s’en servir), ensuite d’avoir un matériel adapté et enfin les formats (liés au téléchargement/streaming) évoluent sans cesse et sont très souvent encodés/compressés…
L’usage de plusieurs méthodes d’écoute n’est pas incompatible et peut même être complémentaire :
- streaming pour écoute de type 'radio'
- téléchargement/achat/support physique pour écoute Hi-Fi haute définition D[SD]

Quant à l’utilisation de cartes mémoires type SD, celles-ci comportent de nombreux avantages par rapport aux supports de type optique (CD, DVD, Blu-ray) :
- plus de problèmes mécaniques : usure, poussière, rayures, traces de doigt, etc…
- électroniques : complexité, usure laser, correction d'erreurs, mémoire tampon, horloge, etc…
- longévité, insensibilité aux conditions climatiques
- très peu de maintenance
- technologie actuelle (21ème siècle) et mature
De plus, un système de protection de Copyright est prévu d’origine dans le format SD : Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM).


Aussi, les avantages par rapport aux DACs USB qui apparaissent actuellement sont indéniables :
-fonctionnement autonome, pas besoin d’ordinateur PC/Mac
- pas de problèmes liés à l’interface USB : connexion, stabilité, synchro, drivers, players, etc…
- fonctionnement absolument silencieux (pas de pièces mécaniques, ventilateurs, etc)
- vrai support physique, robuste, fiable et performant

An attempt to commercialize this format was made with the Super Audio CD, whose objective was to succeed the Compact Disc: one with a number of defects inherent in its technology from the late 1970s.
Unfortunately, while its quality is recognized by audiophiles, the SA- CD was a commercial failure for several reasons, one of which is probably that this format does not really brought value to the 'normal' listener relative to the CD...

Today, the situation has changed and new solutions/technologies have emerged : computing capacity increased, flash memory democratization, ever more powerful electronic components... but ultimately, the final auditor has not benefited these advances .

The 'dematerialization' of music is currently fashionable but it also has some drawbacks: it requires to have a computer (and know how to use) , then have a suitable device and finally the formats (related to download/streaming) are constantly changing and are often encoded/compressed ...
The use of several methods of listening is not incompatible and may even be complementary :
- listening to streaming 'radio'
- download/purchase/physical support for Hi-Fi listening HD D[SD]

As for the use of SD memory cards types, they have many advantages over optical media type (CD, DVD, Blu-ray) :
- no more mechanical problems wear, dust, scratches, fingerprints, etc ...
- electronic : complexity, laser wear, error correction, buffer, clock, etc ...
- longevity, insensitivity to weather conditions
- very little maintenance
- current technology (21st century) and mature
In addition, a system of protection of Copyright origin is provided in the SD format : Content Protection for Recordable Media (CPRM). 

Also, the advantages over USB DACs that currently appear are undeniable :
- standalone operation, no computer required PC/Mac
- no problems with the USB interface connection, stability, synchronization, drivers, players, etc ...
- absolutely silent operation (no mechanical parts, fans, etc.)
- real physical support, robust, reliable and efficient
3/ quand ?
pour l'instant, du fait du peu d'outils d'enregistrement/édition adaptés, et à part certains SA-CD, un petit nombre d'enregistrements proposent une résolution 'DSD native'; Cependant, en attendant le tout-DSD, la conversion de formats PCM de très haute qualité (24bits/192kHz ou supérieur) au format DSD permettra d'obtenir dans un premier temps une qualité compatible avec les exigences de la haute-fidélité.
Aussi, si la demande est là, nul doute que l'industrie musicale saura s'adapter afin de proposer de vrais 'DSD'...


3/ when?
at this time, because of the few adapted recording/editing tools , and with the exception of some SA-CD, a small number of records can offer a resolution 'native DSD'; However, waiting for the all–DSD, the conversion of high quality PCM formats (24bits/192kHz or higher) to DSD will provide initially a quality suitable for the requirements of high-fidelity…
Also, if the demand is there, no doubt the music industry will adapt in order to provide real 'DSD' ...

Enjeux et perspectives  
- Issues and Prospects


Le but visé est l’amélioration globale de la qualité audio objective : définition, dynamique, distorsion, bande passante, spatialisation… afin de laisser s’exprimer la Musique !
Et le contexte actuel étant ce qu’il est, plusieurs aspects sont à prendre en compte :The goal is the overall improvement in the objective audio quality : definition, dynamic, distortion, bandwidth, spatialisation... to let them express the Music!
And the current situation being what it is, several aspects should be taken into account :

	Epoque 'post-CD' :
L’ère du CD touche à sa fin et un nouveau modèle économique est donc à réinventer…
Actuellement on a le choix entre un modèle de type totalement dématérialisé par internet (téléchargement ou streaming) et un modèle de distribution classique de médias physiques : DVD-A, Blu-ray Pure Audio, (SD-ROM… ?)
Mais pourquoi pas imaginer un modèle 'hybride' de téléchargement HD associé à un support !? : certains sites spécialisés proposent d’ores et déjà des fichiers haute-qualité « Studio-Masters »…
Il suffira alors de copier ces fichiers .DSF ou .DSD sur une carte SD et on aura l’équivalent d’un CD 'gravé' mais avec la qualité d’un SA-CD (mais sans les problèmes mécaniques/optiques)…
Les 2 modèles peuvent en effet co-exister :
- téléchargement + mémoire flash (équivalent de l’actuel CD-RW 'réinscriptible')
- support physique avec mémoire de type ROM (idem CD pressé) + 'D[SD]pack' (packaging personnalisé/créatif)

 ‘post – CD’ time :
The CD’s time coming to end and a new economic model is to reinventing ...
Currently there is a choice between a model type completely dematerialized by internet (download or streaming) and a classical distribution model of physical media : DVD-A, Pure Audio Blu-ray, (SD-ROM ... ? )
But why not imagine a 'hybrid' model of HD download associated with a support ? : Some specialty sites already offer high-quality files ""Studio-Masters"" ...
So, it just copy these files .DSF or .DSD on an SD card and we will have the equivalent of a CD 'engraved' but with the quality of a SA-CD (but without the mechanical/optical problems) ...
The two models can indeed co-exist :
- download + flash memory (equivalent to the current CD-RW)
- physical medium with a ROM type memory (as CD pressed) + 'D[SD]pack' (custom/creative packaging)
Exemples de D[SD]pack :D[SD]pack examples:


Pour information, voici un comparatif de la taille mémoire occupée en fonction de différents formats pour une piste de musique classique d’environ 10 minutes :For information, here is a comparison of the memory occupied according to various formats for classical music track about 10 minutes:


On peut remarquer que le format DSD64 (non compressé) occupe moins d’espace que le format PCM24/192 (compression FLAC) et le DSD128 pèse presque deux fois moins lourd que son équivalent PCM (DXD)…
Une carte mémoire de 4Go suffirait pour stocker environ 74 minutes de musique (soit l’équivalent d’un CD) en très haute définition DSD128 non compressé.
Peu utilisée pour l’instant, la technologie de compression sans pertes DST (Direct Stream Transfer) permettra de réduire la taille occupée d’un facteur compris entre 2 et 3 (standard MPEG-4 Audio).It may be noted that the DSD64 size (uncompressed) occupies less space than the size PCM24/192 (FLAC compression) and DSD128 weighs almost two times lighter than its equivalent PCM (DXD)...
A memory card of 4GB is enough to store about 74 minutes of music (equivalent of a CD) in high definition uncompressed DSD128.
Little used so far, the technology lossless compression DST (Direct Stream Transfer) will reduce the size occupied by a factor of between 2 and 3 (standard MPEG-4 Audio).

	Fin de la 'guerre du volume' :
Depuis plusieurs années, les mélomanes avertis constatent une perte de qualité au niveau dynamique. En effet, encouragées par les auditeurs/consommateurs, certaines maisons de disque/producteurs ont participé à une course au volume sonore et cette demande ""je veux que mon disque sonne plus fort que celui de machin"" a abouti à des aberrations telle que la 'loudness war' (lien wiki)

L'arrivée d'un nouveau format permettrait de définir/normaliser la dynamique des programmes et enregistrements musicaux.

Comme amélioration, on peut imaginer des métadonnées contenues dans les fichiers permettant au lecteur d'auto-régler son volume afin d'homogénéiser les différences de niveaux d'écoute en fonction des D[SD] insérés…
Dans une perspective d’évolution, on peut aussi imaginer un processeur intégré qui adapte la dynamique des enregistrements en fonction du niveau de bruit environnant.

 End of the 'Loudness War' :
For several years, music lovers find a quality loss to Dynamic. In fact, encouraged by listeners/consumers , some record labels/producers participated in a race to volume and the demand ""I want my record sounds louder than other"" has led to aberrations such as 'loudness war' (wiki link)

The arrival of a new format would define/standardize the dynamic range of musical recordings and programs.
As an improvement, we can imagine some metadata contained in the files allowing players to self-adjust its volume to homogenize differences listening levels based on D[SD] inserted ...

In an evolution perspective, we can also imagine an embedded processor that adjust the dynamics of records based on surrounding noise level.

	Economie locale :
Les limites de la mondialisation débridée commencent à se faire sentir et une économie alternative est possible si les consommateurs deviennent acteurs…
Du fait de l’utilisation de technologies courantes et simples, la relocalisation de toute la filière musicale peut être envisagée : du producteur (groupes ou musiciens) au consomm’acteur’ (l’auditeur) en passant par toutes les étapes intermédiaires ; par exemple, pour des artistes locaux, des séries de 'D[SD]pack' peuvent être produites en petit nombre. 
Le rôle des disquaires (indépendants ou non) peut également s’étendre, par exemple en proposant des services et conseils adaptées/personnalisées.
Les 'D[SD]pack' seront de préférence en carton recyclé (+ écologique) et seront fortement personnalisables ; issus d’une production locale et respectueuse de l’environnement (imprimeurs labélisés Imprim'Vert).

 Local economy :
The limits of unbridled globalization begin to feel and an alternative economy is possible if consumers become actors...
Due to the use of easy and current technologies, the re-location of the entire music industry can be considered : from the producer (bands and musicians) to the consum'actor' (the listener) through all the intermediate steps; for example, a series of 'D[SD]pack' can be produced in small numbers for local artists .
The role of record stores (independent or not) can also be extended, for example by providing services and personalized/tailored advices.
The 'D[SD]pack' are preferably recycled cardboard (more ecological) and will be highly customizable, from an environment-friendly local production (ecological ink printers).


2014 sera-t-elle l’année de la haute-définition audio en D[SD] ?...  à vous de choisir !…2014 will be the year of the high-definition audio in D[SD] ?...   the choice is yours !....

<h2>Do You Love ASMR?</h2>
<p>Have you ever become pleasantly zoned out while watching Bob Ross or listening to someone tap their nails? If so, then you've probably experienced ASMR.</p>
<p>ASMR (or autonomous sensory meridian response) is a deeply relaxing experience in which certain sounds trigger a tingly feeling in your body. People describe it as chill, blissful, even euphoric–and it can be brought on by something as simple as listening to someone brush their hair, whisper, or crinkle paper. It may sound a little out there, but it's hugely popular. (Perhaps you've read about how Cardi B's a fan or seen the ASMR commercial featuring Zoë Kravitz?)</p>
<p>Whether you're a longtime ASMR enthusiast or just curious, we have a first of its kind product that we think you'll love.</p> <h2>Experience ASMR Like Never Before</h2>

<p> </p>
<p>It's called SleepPhones®: ASMR Edition, and it's the first headphones to come preloaded with ASMR content. (Eight hours, in fact!)</p>
<p>And these aren't just any headphones–they're SleepPhones®, the world's most comfortable headphones for sleeping and relaxing. SleepPhones® feature flat speakers in a soft, stretchy headband. They also contain a thin, flexible module with a button that lets you play, pause, skip tracks, and control the volume. With SleepPhones®: ASMR Edition, there's no external device or cords–just simple headphones that can play for 20 hours from a three-hour charge. </p>

<p>You'll love the superior sound quality from the eco-friendly, lead-free speakers. Ditto for the comfortable headband made from our proprietary SheepCloud™ fabric. Our headbands are machine washable and come in two fabrics: warm Fleece and moisture-wicking Breeze. You can also choose from three sizes and lots of great colors!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Get Ready to Tingle </h2>
<p>We worked with 16 top ASMRtists from all over the world to create the preloaded recordings for SleepPhones®: ASMR Edition. You'll enjoy everything from rhythmic tapping to light scratching to peaceful Italian whisperings. And you'll enjoy lots of it because these artists have recorded 8 hours of deeply relaxing ASMR content for your listening pleasure! </p>
<p>Imagine slipping a soft, pliable headband over your ears. A small button in the back of the headband cues hours of ASMR to start playing. This button also lets you adjust the volume and skip tracks. There are no ads, no blue light from a device, and no scrolling–just a whole lot of incredibly relaxing ASMR ready for you to enjoy.</p> <h2>Unwind with These ASMRtists </h2>

<p>Beyond helping people sleep and relax, SleepPhones® became very popular within the ASMR community.

<h3>Podcaster Pro™  Perks</h3>
<p><strong>Club 33</strong> - A members-only community of Podcaster Pro™ supporters where Adam will post training videos on getting the best sound for your podcast. Even if you don't buy the Podcaster Pro™ (and you should) you will learn something from the training. </p>
<p><strong>Podcaster Pro™</strong> - Whether you get the Earlybird or the regular version, you will be getting the only audio device incorporating all of Adam's designs in a small, portable package.</p>
<p><strong>Mic Combo</strong> will include the Podcaster Pro™ as well as a Mic selected by Adam as a great mid-priced option. Adam is still testing mics so details won't be announced until later.</p>
<p><strong>Headphone Combo</strong> will include the Podcaster Pro™ and a pair of headphones tested and selected by Adam. Adam is still testing headsets so details won't be announced until later.</p>
<p><strong>Signature Edition</strong> Podcaster Pro™ - There are a number of signature edition versions. The functionality of the signature editions is identical to the standard edition. *-What makes these editions special is that they look nicer, with an upgraded material on the sides (TBD polished painted wood, carbon fiber, etc) and they have a signature laser engraved of either Adam or one of the other Signature Edition partners. Buying a Signature Edition means you want to support this project above and beyond simply buying the cheapest version. You want to help us make this a company which will develop other innovative audio products after this campaign is over. As a way of thanking you for that level of support, we provide an upgraded, signed and numbered limited edition of the Podcaster Pro™. They will only be available during the campaign, and once they are gone, no more will be made.</p>
<p><strong>Adam recording a Station ID</strong> - is a perk that in only available when ordering an Adam Curry Signature Edition Podcaster Pro. This will mean that Adam will record and send you a station ID similar to ""This is Adam Curry and you're listening to PODCASTNAME""</p>
<p><strong>Ticket to Podcast Movement</strong> 17 - is a very special perk that will let you purchase a heavily discounted ticket to the Event bundled with the cheapest Podcaster Pro™. This gives the buyer a $250 discount off the current ticket price as well as a great price for the Podcaster Pro™</p>
<p><strong>Adam</strong><strong> Hand Built Edition</strong> Podcaster Pro is one of the first 10 units that are built, with Adam doing all the 'non-robot' assembly himself. These units will be the first to ship, and of course, there are just a few produced. This version includes signatures by all 3 of the principles inside the case - just like the original Mac did. </p>
</div>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<h3>Goals </h3>
<p>To get volume discounts necessary to mass produce the Podcaster Pro™ at a reasonable price, we need to raise a minimum of $500,000. At that level, we will be able to manufacture and deliver the PodcasterPro™ to all the contributors, pay off existing design expenses from the last 18 months, and cover large one-time costs like board R&amp;D, firmware development, and factory mold making.</p>
<p>As a stretch goal, at $1,000,000 raised, we will be able to continue manufacturing the Podcaster Pro™ for sale at retail. So even if you don't buy one through this campaign, help get the word out so that we are able to offer it beyond this single Indiegogo campaign. We will additionally unlock more color options than Black, once we hit $1mil.</p>
<p>By pledging the money to allow us to manufacture the Podcaster Pro™ you will receive perks at your level of contribution. </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/k_2yDovR6YI""></iframe></div></div>
<h3>Delivery </h3>
<p>We will continue producing prototypes and tweaking parameters during the rest of the campaign. Any issues we find and rectify will enable a faster transition to manufacturing. For this reason please be patient if we are slow to answer questions - were probably working on the product.</p>
<p>At the end of the campaign, we hope to take the hand wired boards and put in the order for mass production, as well as purchase enough components to fulfill all orders and still have extras.</p>
<p>August and September will be busy for board assembly and getting production of non-electronic parts such as the case and buttons put into full production. While we are using US Manufacturing, some parts may still have long shipping or delays in machine time. We will also be showing the device at Podcast Movement 17 - so if you ordered, you will be able to have the first look there.</p>
<p>Our goal is to have the first small batch of fully functioning units done in October. This will allow the first tiers to be fulfilled. Since things move slowly in November and December, we need to be sure October production is up to speed to ensure that deliveries of the Signature Editions are done in December. While it is fully our intention to ship units out in December, please consider expecting a unit before Christmas a high risk. There are too many possible delays, not the least of which is UPS and Fedex having millions of extra shipments, that may cause delays, even if we are able to ship before Dec 23.</p>
<p>Our plan is to have the largest production runs in January through March. Shipping units based on perks selected and date of pledge. So keep in mind that people in the same perk group may get shipments that are a month apart simply based on how long they waited during the campaign before commiting. Commit early! Commit often!</p>

<p>While the original idea of the Podcaster Pro™ originated with Adam Curry over a decade ago, to make this idea a reality, a team of experts was needed. About 18 months ago Adam reached out to Gene Naftulyev and Charles Thompson to see if it could be feasible to turn his idea into reality.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495753320/awvcel3jznpf3sv9ayru.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p>That was the birth of <strong>Small</strong> <strong>Batch</strong> <strong>Audio</strong>: the company formed in Austin, TX to design and develop the un-named all-in-one audio device.  </p>
<p>Over the course of the next 18 months work was started both to design the hardware based on Adam's specs, and to ensure a  successful Indiegogo campaign. </p>
<p>From the product side this meant not only figuring out which components would meet the requirements and designing a way for them to work together, but also designing a case that is small enough to be portable, and yet able to allow heat to dissipate without use of fans which would be a problem in a studio environment. Additionally, the ergonomics and UI/UX had to be developed to provide an interface that didn't complicate the normal audio recording workflow. </p>
<p>Testing of individual components began 6mo into the project and the first functional, but not pretty, functional prototype board was created. Then during the next several months' firmware and software was written to allow seamless use of the product. Meanwhile, case design was being done to accommodate the hardware. Production of a prototype case would not be possible for months - until final dimensions of the pre-production circuit boards were finalized. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495753279/givjybbqtya9olsjtqzw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>While most of the design work was finished, there were still several questions about sourcing components that could not be answered. Starting a campaign at that point in time would not be unusual, however, the team felt that it is better to delay the launch of the Indiegogo campaign until all of these questions were answered.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495554488/fdxrtb1khcbzvwandsny.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>Around March 2017, enough work had been done on the prototype that unanswered questions were all gone and the work to get ready for the campaign began. Several hours of video footage, both for the pre-launch site - <a href=""http://smallbatch.audio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://smallbatch.audio</a> - and for the campaign had been shot and were being edited down to 2 minutes. Both Indiegogo and Kickstarter were considered, but Indiegogo was chosen due to its bigger commitment to the Audio and Hardware space that the product occupied. In a nutshell, more people would see the product on Indiegogo who were not already following the project. This extra audience gave Indiegogo a definite advantage.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Podcaster Pro™ Creating podcasts takes passion, time, and energy!By podcasting, you have already made a substantial commitment because you care about your message.You don't want to ruin the show with poor sound quality. But you also don't want to spend several hours editing a 30-minute show! The secret to a great sounding podcast, created in barely more time than it takes to record it, is professional quality live recording.Adam Curry, like other radio professionals, couldn't spend hours in post production during live broadcasts, so instead, he relied on professional level gear that can provide a clean live sound, requiring no post production editing.Using this same method Adam creates 6hr of podcasts every week, which is ready and uploaded in less than 30 minutes. Adam has spent tens if not hundreds of thousands of dollars on audio gear over the last 30 years. Over the last 18 months, his knowledge has gone into designing and prototyping a single, small audio device that he currently uses for his own podcast. Now he'd like to share that device with you.Introducing the Podcaster Pro™The Podcaster Pro™ is designed from the ground up to provide the best possible audio quality for either live streaming or recording.Every component, from custom chip programming, to board design, to case design, to the custom knobs, has been rigorously engineered to Adam's specifications, giving you his years of experience in Radio and Television to create the single most ergonomic all-in-one audio processing device for podcasters and voice over talent. No other product provides all of the functionality of the Podcaster Pro™ in a small portable package at this incredible low Indiegogo price level.The Podcaster Pro™ lets you tailor recording options using an intuitive interface of just 2 dials and 3 soft buttons. All parameters can be adjusted and then saved to memory for later recall. You can also reset the box to Adam's personal presets at the push of a button! Podcaster Pro™ Audio Specs6 Input channels total
2x XLR Mic inputs with 48vPhantom Power
1x stereo skype/ voip USB input
1x stereo computer/soundboard USB input
4 Output channels
1x stereo Mix Minus for Skype via USB
1x stereo Main via USB
1x stereo Main analog out 
2x headphones with independent volume controls4x independent noise gates5x compressors/limiters 2x A class preamps5x independent EQs2x cough switches
 

Podcaster Pro™  Perks
Club 33 - A members-only community of Podcaster Pro™ supporters where Adam will post training videos on getting the best sound for your podcast. Even if you don't buy the Podcaster Pro™ (and you should) you will learn something from the training. 
Podcaster Pro™ - Whether you get the Earlybird or the regular version, you will be getting the only audio device incorporating all of Adam's designs in a small, portable package.
Mic Combo will include the Podcaster Pro™ as well as a Mic selected by Adam as a great mid-priced option. Adam is still testing mics so details won't be announced until later.
Headphone Combo will include the Podcaster Pro™ and a pair of headphones tested and selected by Adam. Adam is still testing headsets so details won't be announced until later.
Signature Edition Podcaster Pro™ - There are a number of signature edition versions. The functionality of the signature editions is identical to the standard edition. *-What makes these editions special is that they look nicer, with an upgraded material on the sides (TBD polished painted wood, carbon fiber, etc) and they have a signature laser engraved of either Adam or one of the other Signature Edition partners. Buying a Signature Edition means you want to support this project above and beyond simply buying the cheapest version. You want to help us make this a company which will develop other innovative audio products after this campaign is over. As a way of thanking you for that level of support, we provide an upgraded, signed and numbered limited edition of the Podcaster Pro™. They will only be available during the campaign, and once they are gone, no more will be made.
Adam recording a Station ID - is a perk that in only available when ordering an Adam Curry Signature Edition Podcaster Pro. This will mean that Adam will record and send you a station ID similar to ""This is Adam Curry and you're listening to PODCASTNAME""
Ticket to Podcast Movement 17 - is a very special perk that will let you purchase a heavily discounted ticket to the Event bundled with the cheapest Podcaster Pro™. This gives the buyer a $250 discount off the current ticket price as well as a great price for the Podcaster Pro™
Adam Hand Built Edition Podcaster Pro is one of the first 10 units that are built, with Adam doing all the 'non-robot' assembly himself. These units will be the first to ship, and of course, there are just a few produced. This version includes signatures by all 3 of the principles inside the case - just like the original Mac did. 


Goals 
To get volume discounts necessary to mass produce the Podcaster Pro™ at a reasonable price, we need to raise a minimum of $500,000. At that level, we will be able to manufacture and deliver the PodcasterPro™ to all the contributors, pay off existing design expenses from the last 18 months, and cover large one-time costs like board R&D, firmware development, and factory mold making.
As a stretch goal, at $1,000,000 raised, we will be able to continue manufacturing the Podcaster Pro™ for sale at retail. So even if you don't buy one through this campaign, help get the word out so that we are able to offer it beyond this single Indiegogo campaign. We will additionally unlock more color options than Black, once we hit $1mil.
By pledging the money to allow us to manufacture the Podcaster Pro™ you will receive perks at your level of contribution. 

Delivery 
We will continue producing prototypes and tweaking parameters during the rest of the campaign. Any issues we find and rectify will enable a faster transition to manufacturing. For this reason please be patient if we are slow to answer questions - were probably working on the product.
At the end of the campaign, we hope to take the hand wired boards and put in the order for mass production, as well as purchase enough components to fulfill all orders and still have extras.
August and September will be busy for board assembly and getting production of non-electronic parts such as the case and buttons put into full production. While we are using US Manufacturing, some parts may still have long shipping or delays in machine time. We will also be showing the device at Podcast Movement 17 - so if you ordered, you will be able to have the first look there.
Our goal is to have the first small batch of fully functioning units done in October. This will allow the first tiers to be fulfilled. Since things move slowly in November and December, we need to be sure October production is up to speed to ensure that deliveries of the Signature Editions are done in December. While it is fully our intention to ship units out in December, please consider expecting a unit before Christmas a high risk. There are too many possible delays, not the least of which is UPS and Fedex having millions of extra shipments, that may cause delays, even if we are able to ship before Dec 23.
Our plan is to have the largest production runs in January through March. Shipping units based on perks selected and date of pledge. So keep in mind that people in the same perk group may get shipments that are a month apart simply based on how long they waited during the campaign before commiting. Commit early! Commit often!

We have the capability to build cables that can produce exceptional sound quality but we want to take one step further to build something really awsome. Every decade or so, we see a big change or advance in the music industry. People often get lost in the new audio terms not knowing what they want is what they get and ended up spending a lot of money on the wrong audio gears. This is the reason we created Origin, because it can give the best audio in one piece and we want to put smiles on your face when you hear it. We are not a marketing company, so, we say what we mean and we deliver. </p>

</div><div>To find a matching earphone for the DAC ended up to be the toughest job. Most of the earphone makers don't produce Hi-Res earphones or not quite up to our expectation. There are several earphone driver technologies that can achieve Hi-Res standard (Frequency response at 40Khz is the minimum). Balanced Armature driver is one of the technologies to do the job but it is really expensive and really don't have the bass that we are after. Traditional Dynamic Drivers are really good for the lower frequency sounds.

</div></div>","Origin is our ambition 
 At Star Cable, we hand build high grade audio cables for well known high-end brand customers. We have the capability to build cables that can produce exceptional sound quality but we want to take one step further to build something really awsome. Every decade or so, we see a big change or advance in the music industry. People often get lost in the new audio terms not knowing what they want is what they get and ended up spending a lot of money on the wrong audio gears. This is the reason we created Origin, because it can give the best audio in one piece and we want to put smiles on your face when you hear it. We are not a marketing company, so, we say what we mean and we deliver. 









You need to have Hi-Res earphones and a Hi-Res DAC to hear Hi-Res music.  Each DAC has its on unique characteristic, therefore, a good set of earphones may not be able to deliver to the best sounding potential if mis-matched DAC is used. After we looked at the latest audio standards in Hi-Res and Lossless music format, we are cofident to design and build a product that can truly deliver the performance what the new standards intended for.  So, Origin is end to end Hi-Res and we go even further, Solid Silver wires are used as the signal conductor from the USB connector all the way to the earphones. The Design 

The amount of pure silver we put into Origin is beyond anyone's imagination. 



Sabre32 is the best miniture  DAC processor in the market, it is very powerful and has the capability to faithfully convert  from lossy formats MP3 up to Lossless formats like FLAC (32bit 384Khz resolution) and Quad DSD. (256 times the CD sample rate). Making it the ultimate choice for us to ensure the source of the sound is solid.                                       DAC Casing DesignWe like to use metal in our products. so, we chose aluminum to house the Sabre32 DAC. The casing is light weight with polished surface and the reflective bright shine represents its solid silver content inside the cable. In the back of the case, we will laser carve a set of unique serial ID. The two gold plated buttons are for volume control, we dismissed other buttons, because they are really not that useful and not helping with the exterior appearance. Hi-Res Earphones 


To find a matching earphone for the DAC ended up to be the toughest job. Most of the earphone makers don't produce Hi-Res earphones or not quite up to our expectation. There are several earphone driver technologies that can achieve Hi-Res standard (Frequency response at 40Khz is the minimum).

<h2>Why We Need This Funding?</h2>
<p>Two years ago we did our first Kickstarter campaign to fund four new MIDI instruments. This series was called the MIDIS and included the first model of the Wiggle. We successfully raised 51K to bring the MIDIS to production and shipped all rewards to more than 600 happy backers worldwide.</p>
<p>Although we got great feedback from users and internally known artists from all over the world, we decided to improve the MIDIS 1.0 by modifying the design, redesign the PCB and adding a Bluetooth chip to make them wireless, and more.</p>
<p>In May, earlier this year, we launched the MIDIS 2.0. We noticed that singers who used the Wiggle in their performances, struggled with the complex software needed to make it work. The issue was that many had never worked with music software and depended on their producer (or the front of house). That’s where the idea of the Wiggle App came along: To give singers a simple and easy to use tool to use vocal effects, either on stage, at the studio or at home.</p>
<p>However, we did not have the means to developed the Wiggle App at that time. That’s why we decided to bring the Wiggle Kit to <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/owow/wiggle-kit-a-new-instrument-for-singers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kickstarter</a>: to raise funds for the development of the Wiggle App. Now that we have raised more than $22.5K and released the first version of the Wiggle App, we are working hard on bringing the Wiggle App to next level by developing and coming up with new effects!</p>

How great would it be to affect your vocals with a simple flick of the wrist? That’s why we introduce the Wiggle Kit: a new musical instrument that transforms expressive hand movements into expressive sounds effects.
By twisting your hand in different directions, you simply add sound effects to your voice. In the App that comes with the Wiggle Kit, you pick and change different effects, ranging from simple reverbs and delays to the most complex auto-tune and vocoder effects, all controlled from within the palm of your hand.

 
They Wrote About Us
 

See who is using the Wiggle Kit


 
What is the Wiggle Device?
The core of the Wiggle Kit is the Wiggle device itself. Small in size, but packed with the latest technology, it translates your hand movements into vocal effects. All without any noticeable latency. Up to three different effects can be controlled at the same time by moving the Wiggle from left to right, raising it from low to high or twisting the Wiggle around your wrist.
 
 
Here's how it works
Connect.
Simply connect the Wiggle Device to the App by holding it close to your phone or tablet. It will automatically connect via Bluetooth and be ready to use! 

Select.
Pick one of the 20+ built-in voice effects for each direction of movement. Every effect can be customized and tweaked to your own preferences. 
  
Sing.
Sing into the microphone of your phone, tablet or headphones and the effects are instantly added to your voice. Control the intensity of each effect by twisting and turning the Wiggle.
  
 
What If I Don't Have A Professional Microphone?
We’ve got your back. Our goal was to create the most effortless music-making experience at any skill level. If you don’t have a dedicated microphone, the Wiggle App works great with the built-in microphone in your smartphone or headset, so you can practice anywhere you want!

 
Here's What You Can Do With the Wiggle App
The Wiggle Kit comes with a free App for your smartphone and tablet. Simply connect the Wiggle via Bluetooth, pick an effect from the built-in library and you’re ready to rock. Explore tutorials, find your favorite artists effect presets or start creating your own set of vocal effects to perfectly match your singing style. The possibilities are endless!  
But if you want to use the Wiggle Kit with your own preferred software, we have great news for you: Because the Wiggle Device is fully MIDI-compatible, it works with over 100’s of MIDI apps and software like Ableton Live, Logic and FL Studio. 

 
What's in The Kit?
Whether you’re a professional or aspiring singer, each Wiggle Kit comes with everything you need to get started:

Wiggle Device with travel packaging 
Wiggle App with 20+ effect Packs 
150cm yellowow USB cable 
Microphone strap
Quick start guide and technical manual

<p>I was excited when I tried it because it captured even slight movements of my body and I could express the comfortable pitch waving by using it. It is not same with the other modulation effects for making Lo-fi sound because it is not the cyclic pitch waving but the pitch waving in sync with natural movements such as hitting keys or picking for playing guitar.</p>

<p align=""left"">It extends my range of emotional expression because it reflects my body movements directly in sounds. Tools for controlling sound such as pitch bend and modulation wheel usually limit my expression by taking my hand away from a keyboard. On the other hand, it enriches my expression by applying complex effects in real time that I would have to be edited and inserted later, for example, I can control several sound effects at the same time without taking my hand away from a keyboard. In addition, from the point that It is easy to setup, it is suited for a live use.</p>

Featured DEMO!
 
 
 

 


MOTION SONIC gives you a new music experience that makes sounds become a part of your body. Just let your body flow along with your emotion, it allows you to alter the sound in sync with physical movement of your body. Now, musical performance is more instinctive, expressive and creative.



 
 
 








 
 
 




 
 







 
 
 


you will get a core device of MOTION SONIC, a band for back hand, a band for wrist and USB charging cable. To start with it, download the MOTION SONIC iOS app.
 




You can create your own Motion-Effect. Download MOTION SONIC iOS App and create your expression by selecting specific Motion and linking it to the specific effect you want to sync. It provide a variety of Motions and Effects below. 
※MOTION SONIC app is for iOS( iOS13 or later, iPadOS13 or later required. iPhone 8 or later, iPad 5th generation or later, iPad mini 5th generation or later, iPad Air 3rd generation or later, required) for this campaign. Can not use it on Android and other device.

I aim to create future that you can express sounds through your own body. To make it realized we designed the interactions that completely synchronize sound with your body. It allows you not to be conscious of the presence of the interface to control sound. Now, you can just let your body flow along with your emotion to express sounds.I believe we can create new entertainment never seen before with MOTION SONIC and I’m so excited to create a new culture with you!

 

I was excited when I tried it because it captured even slight movements of my body and I could express the comfortable pitch waving by using it. It is not same with the other modulation effects for making Lo-fi sound because it is not the cyclic pitch waving but the pitch waving in sync with natural movements such as hitting keys or picking for playing guitar.

 

It extends my range of emotional expression because it reflects my body movements directly in sounds. Tools for controlling sound such as pitch bend and modulation wheel usually limit my expression by taking my hand away from a keyboard. On the other hand, it enriches my expression by applying complex effects in real time that I would have to be edited and inserted later, for example, I can control several sound effects at the same time without taking my hand away from a keyboard. In addition, from the point that It is easy to setup, it is suited for a live use.
