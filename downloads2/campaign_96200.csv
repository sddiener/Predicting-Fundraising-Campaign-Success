<p>We are happy to announce that Octodon is partnering with Lenovo to develop a Moto Z module which will power up your Moto Z with super-typing capabilities!</p>
<h3>HI-TECH</h3>
<p>OCTODON is a pocket-sized transformable mobile gadget. Being unfolded it features a comfortable grip while typing and editing texts on your smartphone. Now your keyboard is in your hands. Octodon involves all your fingers into the typing process, that's why Octodon is the fastest typing device among handheld mobile physical keyboards. Typing speed we achieved on the prototype is 400 CPM.</p>
<h3><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/QR86ATnRFEw?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></h3>
<h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>
<p>OCTODON keyboard is a backtyping device, 8 input elements are located on its back side.<br/>Each of 8 back-side elements can be easily directionally pressed in one of four directions (up/down/left/right). So every letter of the alphabet is typed with the single slight movement of one of the fingers. Screen hints located similar to backside elements locations let user know which finger to move in which direction to type required letter.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/3csvpm0zidkcfun/typing-wings.gif?dl=1"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div><p>Thumb’s elements are located on the front side and responsible for space, backspace, common punctuation marks and switching between input modes.</p></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h3>EASY TO LEARN</h3>
<p>Very intuitive ""matte glass"" style interface helps you to start typing right out of the box. Octodon gives you distinct tactile feedback, and the perfect feeling of the keys. It is easy to learn and master.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/7cRnwx80A08?rel=0?ecver=2?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> Just by solving your everyday tasks, by writing notes, code or emails you will quickly increase your speed. Touch-typing comes to you naturally – you do not need to memorize the layout… it just comes by itself soon. Just use Octodon and your mechanical memory will do the rest.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>HIGHLY ADJUSTABLE</h3>
<p>We all have unique hands of different size. But with our patented magnetic joysticks you can reposition OCTODON input elements individually, up to your hands - for the best fit. Either you have big or small fingers - it's good for both. OCTODON is the only keyboard that perfectly fits YOUR hand. Simply adjust the keyboard up to you.</p>

<h2 style=""margin-top:30px;""><span style=""color: #9b26af;"">What is the Product Configurator?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<span>A series of Odoo modules that offers users the freedom and flexibility over customizable products:</span><ul>

</div>
<div>
<h2 style=""margin-top:30px;""><span style=""color: #9b26af;"">Is it for you?</span></h2>
<ul><li>
<strong>Businesses and users</strong><ul>
<li>Having flexible product customization in a powerful tool such as Odoo will allow you to integrate your customers orders directly in your manufacturing / supply proccess.</li>
<li>All the time spent to process orders, insert them in the backend, educate clients on what is possible and not, manual error-prone human checks of builds will all be done automatically and safely by the client in an instant.</li>
<li>Ever experienced issues with separate eShop platforms and other backend softwares trying to act as a single system? With Odoo's rich backend modules, eCommerce platform and the Product Configurator, you won't have to.</li>
<li>For most standard approaches you won't have to write a single line of code. We started emulating several product configuration processeses ranging from simple items such as fashion articles to complex car configurators. They all have the same base and require only your instructions from the graphical interface. Clean and simple.</li>
</ul> <strong>For developers and partners</strong><ul>
<li>Several users and businesses delay or even drop migration or implementation of Odoo because their business requires direct input from their customers regarding customizable products. From the start of the campaign we have had several people approaching us stating this fact.</li>
<li>With the added flexibility of such a module, the market for Odoo implementation and customization will grow. Demands from customers requiring these features are done at a fraction of the cost. And delivery of features will be executed much faster than on individual development alone.</li>
<li>The module suite will land in OCA repositories. Under the supervision of multiple talented developers which ensures a steady and reliable evolution. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Pledra's association with OCA (Odoo Community Association) brings together a series of powerful contributors for this project.</li>
<li>Our experience with Odoo spans over 4 years, out of which 3 were focused specifically on this set of feature. The modules developed are in production for our customer for over a year successfully. And we continue to improve and upgrade them constantly.</li>
<li>Over 540 contributors, 32.000 commits and 140 repositories OCA is by far the largest organisation in the Odoo ecosystem. With a solid reputation and a massive streak of contributions, it holds 1st place for the most apps deployed on the appstore. A whopping count of over 900 as of this writing. It is essentially a hub for all the top professional Odoo companies and developers around the world working together under the open source spirit.</li>
<li>The project shall be hosted and maintained by the OCA upon campaign finalization and will benefit from all the contributors of the community including ourselves. The OdooMRP team consisting of contributors specialized in the manufacturing sector will oversee the project's development and merger of functionalities.</li>
<li>For the reason stated above overfunding shall be redirect towards the OdooMRP team in order to cover the related costs. Depending on the sum it can fund additional features and modules as well.</li>
<li> We are happy to be backed by such experienced professionals with reputation in the community such as Pedro Manuel Baeza Romero and Ana Juaristi leading the OdooMRP project. As well as all the board members of the OCA involved in this entire process of making this possible such as: Joël Grand-Guillaume, Alexandre Fayolle and many others.</li>

<h2><span style=""color: #9b26af;margin-top:30px;"">Why we made it?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Add missing functionality</b><ul>
<li>Prevent costly creation of all possible product variants.</li>
<li>Generate variants on a per-request basis only (use only what you need).</li>
<li>Prevent unbuildable products from being generated using compatibility/configuration rules.</li>
<li>Frontend auto-generated, user friendly form for customers to create and purchase variants directly from the e-shop.</li>
<li>Higher degree of automation, reducing manual intervention between customer request and supply.</li>
<li>Custom value support.</li>
<li>Multiple selection support.</li>
<li>Many more...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Take Odoo to new heights  </b><p style=""display: inline !important;float: right;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439310786/l8auaquezyjr4mhskcl8.png"" src="""" style=""width: 144px;height: 134px;""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Odoo will be one of the few platforms that fully integrates the user in the production process bringing a new level of automation completely out of the box with no costly customization required.</li>
<li>The flexibility offered by the product configurator for both Odoo users and customers will offer a major competitive advantage over other ERP systems by opening up a unexploited segment of users .</li>
<li><span>The Product Configurator reduces Odoo's dependency on other more mature front-end platforms like Magento and Prestashop.</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The </span> <b style=""background-color: initial;"">visibility impact</b> <span style=""background-color: initial;""> this can have on the Odoo platform can be tremendous. Drawing in more users and developers into the Odoo ecosystem.</span>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""margin-top:30px;""><span style=""color: #9b26af;"">Why fixed funding?</span></h2>
<ul>
<li><span>The original form of the product configurator has over 2 years of development on board.A complete solution requested by our customer in the manufacturing sector.</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">After completion we explored the possibility of converting the heavily customized module to a generic form that works with all businesses. </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">This came with a significant cost of time, over </span> <span style=""background-color: initial;"">1000 hours</span> <span style=""background-color: initial;""> invested just for the conversion from our customer specific version to the generic form.</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As such the initial development time funded by our customer (Aluart A.G) would be shared with the community but the work invested into transforming the module and offering it to the community has 0 funding.</span></li>
<li><span>Flexible funding allows a campaign to end before the funds are reached regardless of the amount.We cannot justify our costs or guarantee the delivery of perks below the allocated budget.</span></li>
<li><span>It also offers transparency and assures that we can deliver our promise or you get a complete refund otherwise. This also prevents unfortunate cases where donations are made by certain users in good faith but the target is not reached and there are insufficient funds to fulfill perks. This requires the campaign manager to either deliver the project and perks under the set budget or refund users manually while covering all the platform fees.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""margin-top:30px;""><span style=""color: #9b26af;"">What License will the modules have?</span></h2>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Our belief is that the Product Configurator can only reach its true potential by joining the ecosystem that made Odoo great in the first place, and that is  <b>Open Source </b>software.</li>
<li>Thus the desired license for the release is <b>AGPL V3</b>, free for anyone to install, contribute and distribute.</li>
<li>The modules will be hosted by OCA in their repositories</li>
<li>However this can only be achieved if the campaign reaches its goal.</li>

</div></div>","Our second campaign is now live!
 
Same budget, more features. Check it out: Odoo Product Configurator Modules

 
What is the Product Configurator?


A series of Odoo modules that offers users the freedom and flexibility over customizable products:
Product Configurator
Website Product Configurator
Product Configurator API (Work in Progress)
More planned...


For more details please visit our website 



Is it for you?

Businesses and users
Having flexible product customization in a powerful tool such as Odoo will allow you to integrate your customers orders directly in your manufacturing / supply proccess.
All the time spent to process orders, insert them in the backend, educate clients on what is possible and not, manual error-prone human checks of builds will all be done automatically and safely by the client in an instant.
Ever experienced issues with separate eShop platforms and other backend softwares trying to act as a single system? With Odoo's rich backend modules, eCommerce platform and the Product Configurator, you won't have to.
For most standard approaches you won't have to write a single line of code. We started emulating several product configuration processeses ranging from simple items such as fashion articles to complex car configurators. They all have the same base and require only your instructions from the graphical interface. Clean and simple.
 For developers and partners
Several users and businesses delay or even drop migration or implementation of Odoo because their business requires direct input from their customers regarding customizable products. From the start of the campaign we have had several people approaching us stating this fact.
With the added flexibility of such a module, the market for Odoo implementation and customization will grow. Demands from customers requiring these features are done at a fraction of the cost. And delivery of features will be executed much faster than on individual development alone.
The module suite will land in OCA repositories. Under the supervision of multiple talented developers which ensures a steady and reliable evolution. 


Why us?
 

 

 

Pledra's association with OCA (Odoo Community Association) brings together a series of powerful contributors for this project.
Our experience with Odoo spans over 4 years, out of which 3 were focused specifically on this set of feature. The modules developed are in production for our customer for over a year successfully. And we continue to improve and upgrade them constantly.
Over 540 contributors, 32.000 commits and 140 repositories OCA is by far the largest organisation in the Odoo ecosystem. With a solid reputation and a massive streak of contributions, it holds 1st place for the most apps deployed on the appstore. A whopping count of over 900 as of this writing. It is essentially a hub for all the top professional Odoo companies and developers around the world working together under the open source spirit.
The project shall be hosted and maintained by the OCA upon campaign finalization and will benefit from all the contributors of the community including ourselves. The OdooMRP team consisting of contributors specialized in the manufacturing sector will oversee the project's development and merger of functionalities.
For the reason stated above overfunding shall be redirect towards the OdooMRP team in order to cover the related costs. Depending on the sum it can fund additional features and modules as well.
 We are happy to be backed by such experienced professionals with reputation in the community such as Pedro Manuel Baeza Romero and Ana Juaristi leading the OdooMRP project. As well as all the board members of the OCA involved in this entire process of making this possible such as: Joël Grand-Guillaume, Alexandre Fayolle and many others.
More information about the OCA organisation and achievements can be found at https://odoo-community.org/


Why we made it?


Add missing functionality
Prevent costly creation of all possible product variants.
Generate variants on a per-request basis only (use only what you need).
Prevent unbuildable products from being generated using compatibility/configuration rules.
Frontend auto-generated, user friendly form for customers to create and purchase variants directly from the e-shop.
Higher degree of automation, reducing manual intervention between customer request and supply.
Custom value support.
Multiple selection support.
Many more...



Take Odoo to new heights  

Odoo will be one of the few platforms that fully integrates the user in the production process bringing a new level of automation completely out of the box with no costly customization required.
The flexibility offered by the product configurator for both Odoo users and customers will offer a major competitive advantage over other ERP systems by opening up a unexploited segment of users .
The Product Configurator reduces Odoo's dependency on other more mature front-end platforms like Magento and Prestashop.

The  visibility impact  this can have on the Odoo platform can be tremendous. Drawing in more users and developers into the Odoo ecosystem.




Why fixed funding?

The original form of the product configurator has over 2 years of development on board.A complete solution requested by our customer in the manufacturing sector.
After completion we explored the possibility of converting the heavily customized module to a generic form that works with all businesses. 

This came with a significant cost of time, over  1000 hours  invested just for the conversion from our customer specific version to the generic form.

As such the initial development time funded by our customer (Aluart A.G) would be shared with the community but the work invested into transforming the module and offering it to the community has 0 funding.
Flexible funding allows a campaign to end before the funds are reached regardless of the amount.We cannot justify our costs or guarantee the delivery of perks below the allocated budget.
It also offers transparency and assures that we can deliver our promise or you get a complete refund otherwise. This also prevents unfortunate cases where donations are made by certain users in good faith but the target is not reached and there are insufficient funds to fulfill perks. This requires the campaign manager to either deliver the project and perks under the set budget or refund users manually while covering all the platform fees.

What License will the modules have?


Our belief is that the Product Configurator can only reach its true potential by joining the ecosystem that made Odoo great in the first place, and that is  Open Source software.
Thus the desired license for the release is AGPL V3, free for anyone to install, contribute and distribute.
The modules will be hosted by OCA in their repositories
However this can only be achieved if the campaign reaches its goal.


 


What versions does it support?
Product Configurator was designed and tested in V8. However migration for all upper versions will soon follow and we already have begun to do it for version 9
When will it be released?
If the campaign succeeds release is planned in 2-3 months in order to add remaining features and squash any lurking bugs.
Spread the word!

<h3>What happened</h3>
<p>This keyboard is what I made for myself while working as a software engineer at LINE, the mobile messenger company. I failed to find a keyboard that looked perfect for me, so I decided I'd build one. So, in the beginning, it was a personal project entirely for myself. But people started telling me ""What is this?"" ""How much is it?"" ""I want to buy it."" ""Sell it already!""</p>
<p><strong>That's why this mass production project began</strong>. Calculation told me that 1,000 unit demand should enable mass production and offer a reasonable price. This is a crowdfunding project where if will try to gather 1,000 people, and if we do, we deliver the product at the price almost as low as the production cost.</p>
<p>So we're trying to find 1,000 people who are willing to buy Moonrim II, the ""liftless"" keyboard with a trackball that lets you make all input without ever taking your hands away from the default position, at the price of <strong>$179</strong> and international shipping at $19 or less.</p>
<p>This is a fixed goal funding, so if it doesn't reach the goal until the end of the campaign, the project is canceled and you will be refunded. Rest assured, there is no risk on your side.</p>
<p>Here are a few things this keyboard is about:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Liftless</h3>
<p>Moonrim II is a <strong>liftless</strong> keyboard. By liftless we mean you <strong>never lift your hand during the keyboard usage</strong>.</p>
<p>In a modern computer environment, your focus is constantly destroyed by the need to lift the hand. To press the <strong>Backspace</strong>, for example, extending the finger is not enough. You have to move your hand (unless you are the lucky person with exceptionally long fingers). This alone is a serious productivity drop because the Backspace is always in the top three most frequently used keys (to err is human). Then there are an awful lot of keys even further from the default position: The function keys, the arrow keys, the numpad, ... If you are a Vim user, you must have felt unhappy at least once about the position of ESC. It's clear that keyboards are “liftful.”</p>
<p>The final nail in the coffin of liftlessness is the <strong>mouse</strong>. Unless you are a seriously advanced computer expert, you need at least one pointing device (be it mouse, touchpad, trackball, or anything) to use a modern computer. The mouse! Your hand's journey begins from the default position: past the point of no Return, across the valley of arrow keys and the dust of numpad… Sometimes the journey fails. You then need your eyes to guide the blind hand.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550466580/ep73k1xjcoqlijuqde9z.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>These are all <strong>interrupts</strong>. Every time you have to look away from your display, your productivity declines and your stream of thought is damaged. You deserve a better work environment where nothing stands between you and the computer. The keyboard, at least, should never get in the way.</p>
<p>Perhaps a bigger problem is that, while you constantly have to look down on the keyboard to correctly position your hand, your upper body is gradually bent. This is known as <strong>Forward Head Posture</strong> (FHP), a serious medical issue where the pressure is so increased that it may fracture your intervertebral disc.</p>
<p>Let's see how Moonrim II can solve this problem…</p>
<h3>Keys: Range of Motion</h3>
<p>So how do we avoid the constant lift? We can solve this by understanding how human hand (typically) works. The first problem with the traditional keyboards is that all input points are laid over a <i>plane</i>. From the anatomical point of view, this forces <i>pronation</i>: twisting of the elbow to make the palm face downward.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550465185/rdl4trttns9oyhlcbutd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Instead of a plane, we can arrange the input points on a <i>3-dimensinoal space</i>, and liberate the elbow from the twisting pain:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550465331/blcclmdtxttifuhz94gd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>“Range of motion” is a concept in musculoskeletal anatomy to describe the space that can be swept by moving a body part with muscles, tendons, and ligaments. We reflected the range of motion of the four fingers from the index to the pinky to decide where to place the keys.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550467520/rybjysci8weosqxfdvbk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550467603/tlw6auvdkztw0sd1kq4w.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This allowed each finger to press more keys than they do in the traditional keyboards without lifting the hand. With the concept of layers (e.g. pressing Fn with other keys will make a different input signal), It's possible to include <strong>all</strong> standard keys in the reachable area!</p>
<h3>Trackball</h3>
<p>After scrapping the planar design, we have a whole lot of extra space for the thumb! The thumb's anatomical range of motion is noticeably different from the other four fingers, making it the only finger that can face the other fingers (the “pinch” movement).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550466475/qac0rb9mhniqbbdjdk5q.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>That means the input points no longer need to be laid out on the same plane; an input point for the thumb can be on a different plane. That's how we positioned the trackball.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550465930/qhptt0lx0eu07qzgdpzx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The space is big enough that we can put a standard size (34mm) trackball to allow movement as fast and precise as a real mouse. The prototype has the ball sustained by three low-friction PTFE points and uses Avago's ADNS-3050 gaming optical sensor to read the movement. It works just as well as a Logitech trackball we have.</p>
<h3>Directional Thumb Switch</h3>
<p>You might have heard of (or even applied) the trick to swap Ctrl and Caps Lock. It certainly alleviates the pain to twist the pinky, but we also know that it's a makeshift solution at best. The Directional Thumb Switch is Moonrim II's answer to end this problem once and for all, in the most elegant way we can imagine.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550467687/mac3glqqgguqub5aguew.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Fingers are not independent</strong>. The four fingers from the index to the pinky are internally connected by a number of tendons and ligaments. Take a look at this Firefox keyboard shortcut example. The keyboard shortcut for restoring a recently closed tab is Ctrl-Shift-T. The reasoning behind this is that since t is for “tab”, Ctrl-T opens a “New Tab”, and by adding Shift it revives a closed tab instead of opening a new tab. There’s nothing wrong with this.</p>
<p>The trouble is how keyboards don’t care at all about the fact that you always have to press the modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, etc.) together with other keys. The finger twisting required for pressing Ctrl-Shift-T is ridiculous; You’ll notices whenever you try it, it stretches the ligaments almost to their limit. This is not the finger’s fault. It’s the keyboard’s fault.</p>
<p>There are some ergo keyboards that try to address this issue by having more thumb keys than a space bar, but we suggest a better solution. By having the thumb key <strong>directional</strong>, like a joystick or a d-pad on a gamepad, we can minimize the thumb's movement and still have a precise input.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550470035/dftrybek7pivi6cimek1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The most important advantage of this approach is that the <strong>combination</strong> of modifiers are ridiculously easy. Most combinations (Ctrl-Alt, Ctrl-Shift, Ctrl-Shift-Fn to name a few) can be done with one thumb, and all combinations (including crazy ones like Fn-Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Meta) can be done with two thumbs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550655094/yrv0pcgtjhjag3rqjdj1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Unlike real joysticks, the prototype uses a “clicky” directional switch to give proper feedback to the thumb when a modifier is pressed. This decision is not final; there are a bewildering number of joystick/d-pad parts available in the market, and we'd like to pick the one most suited for Moonrim II's use case.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Real Ergonomics</h3>
<p>There are so many keyboards that claim to be “ergonomic” that the word doesn't seem to be any more than a marketing buzzword. What is ergonomic? What does it mean for a keyboard to be <i>not</i> ergonomic?</p>
<p>We believe that, for a mechanical design to be truly human-friendly and productive, it must be based on modern medicine, and more specifically, <strong>musculoskeletal anatomy</strong>.</p>
<p>Here's an example. One thing we found in the ergo keyboard design process is that “sideways wandering” contributes much to general typing inaccuracy. On a keyboard, when fingers are traveling only <i>up</i> and <i>down</i>, it's less likely to make typos. The chance of inaccurate press rises when the finger has to move <i>left</i> and <i>right</i>.</p>
<p>This can be explained with the anatomy of human hand. The part we usually call ""palm"" has four bones (called ""metacarpals"") inside, and the finger bones (called ""phalanges"") extend from them.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550461588/jp6trkpgoryral0htuo4.svg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Each of the four fingers from the index to the pinky has three joints. They are called <strong>DIP</strong> (<strong>d</strong>istal <strong>i</strong>nter­<strong>p</strong>halangeal), <strong>PIP</strong> (<strong>p</strong>roximal <strong>i</strong>nter­<strong>p</strong>halangeal), and <strong>MCP</strong> (<strong>m</strong>eta<strong>c</strong>arpo<strong>p</strong>halangeal). All three of them are capable of flexion and extension (the vertical movement), but adduction and abduction (lateral movement) can be done only by the MCP joint. The lateral movement also takes more effort and pain than the vertical one, and to a fairly small range of motion (about 20 degrees).</p>
<p>This is why the lateral movement of the four fingers feels limited, awkward, and inaccurate, while vertically you can move them so deftly, delicately, and freely, with more than 180-degree range of motion. The accuracy of lateral movement is further lowered due to the long distance between the fingertip and the <strong>MCP</strong> joint (compared to the distance between the tip and the <strong>DIP</strong>).</p>
<p>This alone is enough to produce more typos, but since human body instinctively tries to alleviate the pain by moving other parts, the whole hand will shift slightly whenever a lateral movement is made. You'll notice when, on a QWERTY keyboard, you try to alternate between F and G (or H and J), it's not just the lateral movement of the index finger. The entire hand moves. This shift, in turn, offsets the hand to the left and to the right, and during a rapid typing, results in a constant mistyping or a slower typing speed. Moonrim II eliminates this “sideways wandering” by requiring no lateral movement of the four fingers at all.</p>
<p>With traditional keyboards, and even with many “ergo” keyboards, many keys require some painful “wrist twist.” Pressing a basic key like the Backspace is already painful. Moonrim II completely got rid of this problem because there is no sideways movement of the four fingers at all.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550470475/lupazp6vh6qz2y6omddt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With traditional keyboards, and even with many “ergo” keyboards, the hand is constantly pronated, causing a series of disaster to your health. The modern medical community has a deep suspicion that keyboard usage is one of the major causes of Repetitive Stress Injury (RSI), including the Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550471100/hx488dl0ci0rt4uhgysz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This happens because the palm, more specifically where the <i>transverse carpal ligament</i> is covering the <i>median nerve</i>, is constantly pressed by the gravity and the hand's weight. CTS can lead to chronic hand pain, numbness, loss of muscles, and weaker grip. For patients with static numbness, surgery is recommended, which is cutting open the palm and severing the ligament.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550470678/x7jxle2wc4pm3iq4kt9i.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Moonrim II completely got rid of this problem because the palm is not pressed at all. Instead the hands rest on a dedicated “handrests” with curved faces.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550471202/qmccktpuxsck3fi8fyhu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Programmable</h3>
<p>Not only that you will be able to customize the layout, you will also be able to program the keyboard to make all kinds of input.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550484060/v3ikrahfiut0oxtwwsoj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>(an example layout that covers the standard ANSI/ISO key signals)</p>
<p>Any combination or sequence of keys can have new meanings. It works the opposite way too; Any key press can generate a combination or a sequence of keys. In fact, any kind of key action can have new meanings, not just key presses. For example, you can make a key behave differently when it's pressed longer than a second. You can make certain key ""release"" generate a key input signal. You can make certain combination of keys have a completely different behavior compared to when they are pressed independently. The possibilities are endless, your imagination is the limit.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: We're working on the <strong>QMK firmware support</strong>. We haven't made the final decision about which firmware to include by default, but flashing will certainly be an easy option.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550471415/ztwvzdnkoo2qrz44d60c.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The prototype uses a pair of Pro Micros. The production model will also use an Arduino/Genuino compatible board, allowing you to use the standard Arduino IDE for the development. It goes without saying that the default  firmware will be free software, free-as-in-freedom.</p>

<p>My name is <strong>Han Gyeol</strong> and I'm known as <strong>xt</strong>. I used to be a software engineer but now I'm doing hardware engineering. Here's a bit of my track record (if it helps you trust me): I studied computer science at Hanyang University, and worked as a server-side programmer at LINE, the mobile messenger company. At LINE I held the <a href=""https://engineering.linecorp.com/en/blog/line-haskell-boot-camp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LINE Haskell Boot Camp</a> and presented <a href=""https://xtendo.org/monad"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Monad Fear</a>. More about me is on <a href=""https://xtendo.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">xtendo.org</a>, my personal website.</p>
<p>I've been a programmer for some time, embracing keyboard as a tool to make a living. My years of typing began in 1993, programming since 1995, professionally since 2008; Much of my life, especially the recent decade of career, has been spent flexing and extending fingers on an input device. One day I realized the keyboards were ruining my health, so I looked for a perfect keyboard for myself but couldn't find any. I did use some ergo keyboards out there but never got really satisfied. I started building one as a personal project. Then people began to show interest. That's how I ended up trying to gather 1,000 people.</p>
<p><strong>Ahn Shinho</strong> a.k.a. <strong>hstara</strong> (<a href=""https://hstara.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://hstara.com</a>) graduated the University of Seoul, Republic of Korea, with a bachelor’s degree in science in taxation. He wished to live an earnest life as a finance expert up until his friend xt abducted him and talked him into making crazy keyboards.</p>
<p>There are a lot to be taken cared of if you plan to produce 1,000 keyboards with a design not quite available in the market. First you have to import the parts; a bewildering number of them. This causes equally bewildering tax and tariff. You also need to rent a factory and acquire some necessary facilities. That is also taxed. For a project not looking for much profit, all this is not affordable. Fortunately the South Korean law allows ""tech startups"" to deal with these in a somewhat less terrifying ways i.e. if you export the end product, the tariff you paid for importing the parts will be refunded. That's why Moonrim LLC was established: A company solely dedicated to the Moonrim II mass production project.</p>
<p>Moonrim's motto is ""Humans should not adapt to machines; Machines should adapt to humans."" Moonrim is a deliberately ambiguous name. In Korean, Moonrim may mean ""forest of text"", ""forest of questions"", or ""forest of doors"", all of which sound-d fit for a brilliant input device.</p>

</div><h3>Options</h3><p>When you claim your perk, you will be asked to choose among Cherry MX Blue, Red, and Brown.</p><p>A shocking number of people have been discussing and debating the characteristics of different types of mechanical switches for a decades. As a result, remarkably rich information regarding this topic have been published on the Internet. It is impossible for an individual human being to go through all of them.</p><p>So here is a summary:</p><ul>
<li>MX <strong>Blue</strong> is the <strong>clicky</strong> one. When you press the key, a clicky switch will give you a clear haptic feeling that you've pressed it. The advantage is that you'll get a distinct ""feeling"" that you've pressed a key, making it beloved by some typists. The disadvantage is that it could be noisy for an office environment.</li>
<li>MX <strong>Red</strong> switches are <strong>linear</strong>. They are arguably the simplest design of mechanical switch, where there is a spring and nothing else; no mechanism to make the clicking. As the name suggests, they are the quietest option for your Moonrim II. They are known to have lower operating force than average, meaning it takes less finger force to press it.</li>
<li>MX <strong>Brown</strong> switches are <strong>tactile</strong>. When you press them, they do provide the sensation that something stops you and then your force surpassed a threshold. But it's not as clear as the clicky ones. It also makes less noise than the clicky ones. You could say it's an attempt to find the sweet spot somewhere between the Blue and the Red.</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>We'd greatly appreciate your funding, but we also desperately need you to spread the word. $200k is the bare minimum for us to start bulk-ordering the parts, setting up the production facilities, and avoid starvation. Tell your friend about Moonrim II; messages, tweets, blog posts, or any kind of noise you make that will let more people know, will be really helpful.</p></div>","NOTICE:

Here are a few things this keyboard is about:
 
Liftless
Moonrim II is a liftless keyboard. By liftless we mean you never lift your hand during the keyboard usage.
In a modern computer environment, your focus is constantly destroyed by the need to lift the hand. To press the Backspace, for example, extending the finger is not enough. You have to move your hand (unless you are the lucky person with exceptionally long fingers). This alone is a serious productivity drop because the Backspace is always in the top three most frequently used keys (to err is human). Then there are an awful lot of keys even further from the default position: The function keys, the arrow keys, the numpad, ... If you are a Vim user, you must have felt unhappy at least once about the position of ESC. It's clear that keyboards are “liftful.”
The final nail in the coffin of liftlessness is the mouse. Unless you are a seriously advanced computer expert, you need at least one pointing device (be it mouse, touchpad, trackball, or anything) to use a modern computer. The mouse! Your hand's journey begins from the default position: past the point of no Return, across the valley of arrow keys and the dust of numpad… Sometimes the journey fails. You then need your eyes to guide the blind hand.

These are all interrupts. Every time you have to look away from your display, your productivity declines and your stream of thought is damaged. You deserve a better work environment where nothing stands between you and the computer. The keyboard, at least, should never get in the way.
Perhaps a bigger problem is that, while you constantly have to look down on the keyboard to correctly position your hand, your upper body is gradually bent. This is known as Forward Head Posture (FHP), a serious medical issue where the pressure is so increased that it may fracture your intervertebral disc.
Let's see how Moonrim II can solve this problem…
Keys: Range of Motion
So how do we avoid the constant lift? We can solve this by understanding how human hand (typically) works. The first problem with the traditional keyboards is that all input points are laid over a plane. From the anatomical point of view, this forces pronation: twisting of the elbow to make the palm face downward.

Instead of a plane, we can arrange the input points on a 3-dimensinoal space, and liberate the elbow from the twisting pain:

“Range of motion” is a concept in musculoskeletal anatomy to describe the space that can be swept by moving a body part with muscles, tendons, and ligaments. We reflected the range of motion of the four fingers from the index to the pinky to decide where to place the keys.


This allowed each finger to press more keys than they do in the traditional keyboards without lifting the hand. With the concept of layers (e.g. pressing Fn with other keys will make a different input signal), It's possible to include all standard keys in the reachable area!
Trackball
After scrapping the planar design, we have a whole lot of extra space for the thumb! The thumb's anatomical range of motion is noticeably different from the other four fingers, making it the only finger that can face the other fingers (the “pinch” movement).

That means the input points no longer need to be laid out on the same plane; an input point for the thumb can be on a different plane. That's how we positioned the trackball.

The space is big enough that we can put a standard size (34mm) trackball to allow movement as fast and precise as a real mouse. The prototype has the ball sustained by three low-friction PTFE points and uses Avago's ADNS-3050 gaming optical sensor to read the movement. It works just as well as a Logitech trackball we have.
Directional Thumb Switch
You might have heard of (or even applied) the trick to swap Ctrl and Caps Lock. It certainly alleviates the pain to twist the pinky, but we also know that it's a makeshift solution at best. The Directional Thumb Switch is Moonrim II's answer to end this problem once and for all, in the most elegant way we can imagine.

Fingers are not independent. The four fingers from the index to the pinky are internally connected by a number of tendons and ligaments. Take a look at this Firefox keyboard shortcut example. The keyboard shortcut for restoring a recently closed tab is Ctrl-Shift-T. The reasoning behind this is that since t is for “tab”, Ctrl-T opens a “New Tab”, and by adding Shift it revives a closed tab instead of opening a new tab. There’s nothing wrong with this.
The trouble is how keyboards don’t care at all about the fact that you always have to press the modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, etc.) together with other keys. The finger twisting required for pressing Ctrl-Shift-T is ridiculous; You’ll notices whenever you try it, it stretches the ligaments almost to their limit. This is not the finger’s fault. It’s the keyboard’s fault.
There are some ergo keyboards that try to address this issue by having more thumb keys than a space bar, but we suggest a better solution. By having the thumb key directional, like a joystick or a d-pad on a gamepad, we can minimize the thumb's movement and still have a precise input.

The most important advantage of this approach is that the combination of modifiers are ridiculously easy. Most combinations (Ctrl-Alt, Ctrl-Shift, Ctrl-Shift-Fn to name a few) can be done with one thumb, and all combinations (including crazy ones like Fn-Ctrl-Alt-Shift-Meta) can be done with two thumbs.

Unlike real joysticks, the prototype uses a “clicky” directional switch to give proper feedback to the thumb when a modifier is pressed. This decision is not final; there are a bewildering number of joystick/d-pad parts available in the market, and we'd like to pick the one most suited for Moonrim II's use case.
 
Real Ergonomics
There are so many keyboards that claim to be “ergonomic” that the word doesn't seem to be any more than a marketing buzzword. What is ergonomic? What does it mean for a keyboard to be not ergonomic?
We believe that, for a mechanical design to be truly human-friendly and productive, it must be based on modern medicine, and more specifically, musculoskeletal anatomy.
Here's an example. One thing we found in the ergo keyboard design process is that “sideways wandering” contributes much to general typing inaccuracy. On a keyboard, when fingers are traveling only up and down, it's less likely to make typos. The chance of inaccurate press rises when the finger has to move left and right.
This can be explained with the anatomy of human hand. The part we usually call ""palm"" has four bones (called ""metacarpals"") inside, and the finger bones (called ""phalanges"") extend from them.

Each of the four fingers from the index to the pinky has three joints. They are called DIP (distal inter­phalangeal), PIP (proximal inter­phalangeal), and MCP (metacarpophalangeal). All three of them are capable of flexion and extension (the vertical movement), but adduction and abduction (lateral movement) can be done only by the MCP joint. The lateral movement also takes more effort and pain than the vertical one, and to a fairly small range of motion (about 20 degrees).
This is why the lateral movement of the four fingers feels limited, awkward, and inaccurate, while vertically you can move them so deftly, delicately, and freely, with more than 180-degree range of motion. The accuracy of lateral movement is further lowered due to the long distance between the fingertip and the MCP joint (compared to the distance between the tip and the DIP).
This alone is enough to produce more typos, but since human body instinctively tries to alleviate the pain by moving other parts, the whole hand will shift slightly whenever a lateral movement is made. You'll notice when, on a QWERTY keyboard, you try to alternate between F and G (or H and J), it's not just the lateral movement of the index finger. The entire hand moves. This shift, in turn, offsets the hand to the left and to the right, and during a rapid typing, results in a constant mistyping or a slower typing speed. Moonrim II eliminates this “sideways wandering” by requiring no lateral movement of the four fingers at all.
With traditional keyboards, and even with many “ergo” keyboards, many keys require some painful “wrist twist.” Pressing a basic key like the Backspace is already painful. Moonrim II completely got rid of this problem because there is no sideways movement of the four fingers at all.

With traditional keyboards, and even with many “ergo” keyboards, the hand is constantly pronated, causing a series of disaster to your health. The modern medical community has a deep suspicion that keyboard usage is one of the major causes of Repetitive Stress Injury (RSI), including the Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.

This happens because the palm, more specifically where the transverse carpal ligament is covering the median nerve, is constantly pressed by the gravity and the hand's weight. CTS can lead to chronic hand pain, numbness, loss of muscles, and weaker grip. For patients with static numbness, surgery is recommended, which is cutting open the palm and severing the ligament.

Moonrim II completely got rid of this problem because the palm is not pressed at all. Instead the hands rest on a dedicated “handrests” with curved faces.

 
Programmable
Not only that you will be able to customize the layout, you will also be able to program the keyboard to make all kinds of input.

(an example layout that covers the standard ANSI/ISO key signals)
Any combination or sequence of keys can have new meanings. It works the opposite way too; Any key press can generate a combination or a sequence of keys. In fact, any kind of key action can have new meanings, not just key presses. For example, you can make a key behave differently when it's pressed longer than a second. You can make certain key ""release"" generate a key input signal. You can make certain combination of keys have a completely different behavior compared to when they are pressed independently. The possibilities are endless, your imagination is the limit.
Update: We're working on the QMK firmware support. We haven't made the final decision about which firmware to include by default, but flashing will certainly be an easy option.

The prototype uses a pair of Pro Micros. The production model will also use an Arduino/Genuino compatible board, allowing you to use the standard Arduino IDE for the development. It goes without saying that the default  firmware will be free software, free-as-in-freedom.

Who are we?

My name is Han Gyeol and I'm known as xt. I used to be a software engineer but now I'm doing hardware engineering. Here's a bit of my track record (if it helps you trust me): I studied computer science at Hanyang University, and worked as a server-side programmer at LINE, the mobile messenger company. At LINE I held the LINE Haskell Boot Camp and presented The Monad Fear. More about me is on xtendo.org, my personal website.
I've been a programmer for some time, embracing keyboard as a tool to make a living. My years of typing began in 1993, programming since 1995, professionally since 2008; Much of my life, especially the recent decade of career, has been spent flexing and extending fingers on an input device. One day I realized the keyboards were ruining my health, so I looked for a perfect keyboard for myself but couldn't find any. I did use some ergo keyboards out there but never got really satisfied. I started building one as a personal project. Then people began to show interest. That's how I ended up trying to gather 1,000 people.
Ahn Shinho a.k.a. hstara (https://hstara.com) graduated the University of Seoul, Republic of Korea, with a bachelor’s degree in science in taxation. He wished to live an earnest life as a finance expert up until his friend xt abducted him and talked him into making crazy keyboards.
There are a lot to be taken cared of if you plan to produce 1,000 keyboards with a design not quite available in the market. First you have to import the parts; a bewildering number of them. This causes equally bewildering tax and tariff. You also need to rent a factory and acquire some necessary facilities. That is also taxed. For a project not looking for much profit, all this is not affordable. Fortunately the South Korean law allows ""tech startups"" to deal with these in a somewhat less terrifying ways i.e. if you export the end product, the tariff you paid for importing the parts will be refunded. That's why Moonrim LLC was established: A company solely dedicated to the Moonrim II mass production project.
Moonrim's motto is ""Humans should not adapt to machines; Machines should adapt to humans."" Moonrim is a deliberately ambiguous name. In Korean, Moonrim may mean ""forest of text"", ""forest of questions"", or ""forest of doors"", all of which sound-d fit for a brilliant input device.

OptionsWhen you claim your perk, you will be asked to choose among Cherry MX Blue, Red, and Brown.A shocking number of people have been discussing and debating the characteristics of different types of mechanical switches for a decades. As a result, remarkably rich information regarding this topic have been published on the Internet. It is impossible for an individual human being to go through all of them.So here is a summary:
MX Blue is the clicky one. When you press the key, a clicky switch will give you a clear haptic feeling that you've pressed it. The advantage is that you'll get a distinct ""feeling"" that you've pressed a key, making it beloved by some typists. The disadvantage is that it could be noisy for an office environment.
MX Red switches are linear. They are arguably the simplest design of mechanical switch, where there is a spring and nothing else; no mechanism to make the clicking. As the name suggests, they are the quietest option for your Moonrim II. They are known to have lower operating force than average, meaning it takes less finger force to press it.
MX Brown switches are tactile. When you press them, they do provide the sensation that something stops you and then your force surpassed a threshold. But it's not as clear as the clicky ones. It also makes less noise than the clicky ones. You could say it's an attempt to find the sweet spot somewhere between the Blue and the Red.
 Other Ways You Can HelpWe'd greatly appreciate your funding, but we also desperately need you to spread the word. $200k is the bare minimum for us to start bulk-ordering the parts, setting up the production facilities, and avoid starvation. Tell your friend about Moonrim II; messages, tweets, blog posts, or any kind of noise you make that will let more people know, will be really helpful.",30.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a software developer with a 20+ years of experience in IT and good resume and profile on Upwork. Recently i've finished a couple of projects related to online bookmaker business - website data scrapping, working with data providers etc. After that i've started my own project which as far is going pretty good.</p>
<p>Сurrently the system is capable to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grab events/odds data (website scrapping) from several major bookmaker sites - right now it's Betfair, Opap, Pinnacle, Mozzartbet (soccer only for now, but i've tried horse racing too and any other sports with odds can be handled). Odds update interval can be less then 1 second (depends on network conditions and target website performance).</li>
<li>Compare odds from different bookmakers between themselves. Right now only surebets (arbitrage) algorithm is implemented.</li>
<li>Send alerts via Telegram IM if surebet profit for some event/market is grater then some predefined value.</li>
</ol>
<p>The system can be tested and used at <a href=""http://habr.club/surebets/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://habr.club/surebets/</a></p>
<p>The system supports mathematical modeling - it means, it stores all the changing data including odds for every event and every market. If you come up with some strategy you want to test, you don't need to wait for future events to do that - you can run your strategy on already played games for the last month and get the result in seconds - whether your strategy is winning or not. Then you can modify it a little and run it again.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've got M.S. in Math degree from Moscow State Univirsity and when i was starting this project i was going to research and develop some math-based strategies for winning. Surebets betting (arbitrage) is simple but has its limitations (relatively too small profit, bookmakers don't like and block it).</p>
<p>This project started as a personal one and now i don't have enough of dedicated time to finish it by myself since i also need to make a living.</p>
<p>So, actually i'm looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>investors</strong> to help me to add more usable features to this project, and</li>
<li>
<strong>business partners</strong> who can help me to monetize it.</li>
</ul>
<p>For every investment you make you get something - access to the system, addition of your bookmakers to the system, running your strategy, access to automatic bet placement. Anything else you want - just contact me. The system core has many possibilities for extension.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Plans</h3>
<p>There are several directions this system can be extended to to gain value and make revenue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addition of more bookmakers</li>
<li>Investigation into betting strategies, including applying artificial intelligence</li>
<li>Providing bookmakers real-time odds data in a web and API format</li>
<li>Providing surebets stakes and proven tips</li>
<li>Automatic bet placement using Virtual PC or ""headless Chrome"" (like smartbet.io)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have got enough experience to work on the bookmakers market. My specialization in Software Development is B2B Java, i've worked on big projects from Boeing and DARPA in my time.

I'm a software developer with a 20+ years of experience in IT and good resume and profile on Upwork. Recently i've finished a couple of projects related to online bookmaker business - website data scrapping, working with data providers etc. After that i've started my own project which as far is going pretty good.
Сurrently the system is capable to:

Grab events/odds data (website scrapping) from several major bookmaker sites - right now it's Betfair, Opap, Pinnacle, Mozzartbet (soccer only for now, but i've tried horse racing too and any other sports with odds can be handled). Odds update interval can be less then 1 second (depends on network conditions and target website performance).
Compare odds from different bookmakers between themselves. Right now only surebets (arbitrage) algorithm is implemented.
Send alerts via Telegram IM if surebet profit for some event/market is grater then some predefined value.

The system can be tested and used at http://habr.club/surebets/
The system supports mathematical modeling - it means, it stores all the changing data including odds for every event and every market. If you come up with some strategy you want to test, you don't need to wait for future events to do that - you can run your strategy on already played games for the last month and get the result in seconds - whether your strategy is winning or not. Then you can modify it a little and run it again.

What I Need & What You Get
I've got M.S. in Math degree from Moscow State Univirsity and when i was starting this project i was going to research and develop some math-based strategies for winning. Surebets betting (arbitrage) is simple but has its limitations (relatively too small profit, bookmakers don't like and block it).
This project started as a personal one and now i don't have enough of dedicated time to finish it by myself since i also need to make a living.
So, actually i'm looking for:


investors to help me to add more usable features to this project, and

business partners who can help me to monetize it.

For every investment you make you get something - access to the system, addition of your bookmakers to the system, running your strategy, access to automatic bet placement. Anything else you want - just contact me. The system core has many possibilities for extension.

The Plans
There are several directions this system can be extended to to gain value and make revenue:

Addition of more bookmakers
Investigation into betting strategies, including applying artificial intelligence
Providing bookmakers real-time odds data in a web and API format
Providing surebets stakes and proven tips
Automatic bet placement using Virtual PC or ""headless Chrome"" (like smartbet.io)


Risks & Challenges
I have got enough experience to work on the bookmakers market. My specialization in Software Development is B2B Java, i've worked on big projects from Boeing and DARPA in my time. Current system core uses hundreds asynchronous threads to fetch data from websites and come over grab protection. I'm sure my qualification is enough to achieve the goals of this campaign.

<h3>What is Stress Dynamite?</h3>
<p>Have you ever just wanted to <i>break </i>something? Have you ever been so frustrated, so stressed, so helpless, that you just want to take control of something and release that stress by <i>breaking it?</i></p>
<p>For too long, the world's response to that urge has been: bottle it up. Just bottle it up. Fidget, bite your fingernails, ignore it- until it gets too big. Now, Stress Dynamite is here to say, hey, here's something that's safe to break. Go for it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What makes it safe?</h3>
<p>Stress Dynamite is 3d printed, standing on end in the printer. This means that the layers used in 3d printing provide clean places for it to break. The remains of a stick of stress dynamite are not sharp, leave no dust, and will not crumble past the breaks you make.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the string running through the stick keeps all the pieces together, so you can easily dispose of the remains.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's the money for?</h3>
<p>3d printing has a lot of important upsides- but one massive downside. It is expensive to start. In order to get this project off the ground, I will need to buy at least one 3d printer, ideally more, and while the prices of 3d printers have dropped in recent years, it's still more than I can afford, especially if I don't know whether people are behind the idea. Please, if you think this seems like something you want to exist, let me know- through your dollars if you can, but at least through a share and a comment.</p>

<p><strong>The main topic of this watch is based on the construction of flying machine UFO.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How I know the construction of the flying machine? the fact of the description mainly from an engineer named Bob Lazar, who was working in United States, outside of Area 51, base site S4, he was responsible for studying how the operation works of the gravity generator and the time reactor of the flying machines. The part design inside the watch, the concept is from the gravity generator.</strong></p>

In the watch, there are three connecting rotate rudders on the automatic running system, which are designed according to the flying machine UFO, so what you see, it's just 3 connecting rotate rudders, not 4 or 2, and that rudder system on the watch is powering the function of the watch.

<p><strong>I believe that if you know more about the watch, you will find that this watch is extremely difficult to produce.

</div></div>","At first, we introduce this ' time reactor ' watch seen in indiegogo, this champaign is belonging to the second-generation, the 1st generation was in kickstarter, the important issue to raise the1st generation to 2nd generation are the improvement role in the dome-shaped glass. The first-generation was using k1 glass, the second generation will change to Sapphire glass. The cost of sapphire glass is much more expensive at least five times than the K1 glass, but the sapphire glass is worth, it is very hard by plenty production process, even carelessly dropping down the watch into the ground floor, the sapphire glass will not be broken, on the other side, the 1st genernation watch coming back for repairing are mainly that the K1 glass was broken, could not resist the falling crack force on the floor if the backers not handling the watch well or accidently happening. To make sure the quality of the watch, in the 2nd gerenation of ' time reactor' watch, we will move our watch to the valuable platform by using dome-shaped sapphire,  we believe that all coming new backers will accept the new price to get the reliable, durable and charming watch.On the luminous filling issue, the factory had just bought a special filling luminous machine to take charge and care of the production of this watch. It could greatly improve every place and even filling with the luminous light,  to mininize the defect of filling out the boundary by hand.If you want to know the difference and details between the glass of Sapphire and K1, please go to the content below, there will be with detailed explanation. 

 

 
The main topic of this watch is based on the construction of flying machine UFO.
How I know the construction of the flying machine? the fact of the description mainly from an engineer named Bob Lazar, who was working in United States, outside of Area 51, base site S4, he was responsible for studying how the operation works of the gravity generator and the time reactor of the flying machines. The part design inside the watch, the concept is from the gravity generator.
Below with more detailed descriptions for the explanation.
The main design is focused on the ""Reactor"", which is a internal setting in the flying machine UFO, that supplies the energy to the anti-gravity system. In the meantime, the gravity generator is responsible for manufacturer the gravity waves, there are 3, which are responsible for the flight direction. In the watch, there are three connecting rotate rudders on the automatic running system, which are designed according to the flying machine UFO, so what you see, it's just 3 connecting rotate rudders, not 4 or 2, and that rudder system on the watch is powering the function of the watch. According to Bob Lazar, the air around the flying machine will be illuminated into the light when it comes into contact with powerful energy, just like the bottom of the watch, at dark night, it will emit a strong light. 


He is an American businessman, film processor, pyrotechnician, and owner of United Nuclear Scientific Equipment and Supplies. Lazar is primarily known for his claims of being hired in the late 1980s to reverse engineer purported extraterrestrial technology at an alleged secret site called S4, 
located several kilometres south of the Area 51 United States Air Force (USAF) facility






I believe that if you know more about the watch, you will find that this watch is extremely difficult to produce. The difficulty is on the technique of the accessories on the rotating rudders, they are required to process by high technology tools of Laser and CNC, especially the weight, if making too heavy in weight, which will affect the durability of the watch and damage the inside structure of the movement.

The robot kits that were available in the market during that time had fixed outlooks and functions. If it was a puppy pet robot set, then it would just be a puppy robot. If it was a mobile robot, then that was all it could be. Therefore, when you got bored with the mobile robot features, you could not modify it to your own specifications. Children tend to lose interest after playing with it for a short period of time.</span><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/236876/files/20131202093503-combine_2.jpg?1386005703"" src="""" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/236881/files/20131202093902-combine_3.jpg?1386005942"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">Through the years, the market reacted to this problem and henceforth we could see robot kits such as Bioloid, Robobuilder and Vex Robotics sprouting in the market. However, they still used the screw and nut method to construct their robots. This posed a choking hazard to children plus the construction process was too laborious. Thus, it struck us that if we were to bring robot-making to the masses, we would have to make the robot assembling and dismantling process quicker and simpler. Furthermore, the robots would have to be reconfigurable into various physical shapes in order to sustain interest. Four years ago, we started working on a solution by developing a robot construction kit to meet these requirements. Today, we proudly present to you our brainchild – a Reconfigurable Robot, which we have affectionately named <b>rero</b>.<br/></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/269230/files/20131219032349-3kids_construct_robot-s.jpg?1387452229"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Easy to Reconfigure</b></p><p><b></b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/N98WN4UIE9c?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><b><br/></b><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Eliminating the tiny screws and nuts is our main objective in making reconfigurable robots a reality. <b>rero </b>accomplished this with the straightforward sliding method between its connectors and joints. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/275412/files/20131223023055-Eg07_G15-RC-UJ.gif?1387794655"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/275417/files/20131223023638-Eg01_G15-G15.png?1387794998"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/275418/files/20131223023647-Eg02_G15-UJ.png?1387795007"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We do not even need to fasten a single screw in the entire construction process.

<p><b>Production Plan</b></p>
<p>We have 34 molds which are ready for production in our injection molder factory. We will start fabricating another 9 molds as soon as we achieve our basic goal of $45,000. It will take about 4 months to get these 9 molds working. Injecting the parts will only take 1 to 2 weeks.</p>
<p>At the same time we will start ordering the electronic components and send our controller for lab tests. We fabricate the controller in-house so it wouldn't be a problem for us to improve the circuit based on feedback from the tests.</p>

<p></p></div>","Build Your Own Robot Today!The idea of making a quick mounting robot kit with unlimited possibilities has been in our minds since our university days some 7 years ago. The robot kits that were available in the market during that time had fixed outlooks and functions. If it was a puppy pet robot set, then it would just be a puppy robot. If it was a mobile robot, then that was all it could be. Therefore, when you got bored with the mobile robot features, you could not modify it to your own specifications. Children tend to lose interest after playing with it for a short period of time.Through the years, the market reacted to this problem and henceforth we could see robot kits such as Bioloid, Robobuilder and Vex Robotics sprouting in the market. However, they still used the screw and nut method to construct their robots. This posed a choking hazard to children plus the construction process was too laborious. Thus, it struck us that if we were to bring robot-making to the masses, we would have to make the robot assembling and dismantling process quicker and simpler. Furthermore, the robots would have to be reconfigurable into various physical shapes in order to sustain interest. Four years ago, we started working on a solution by developing a robot construction kit to meet these requirements. Today, we proudly present to you our brainchild – a Reconfigurable Robot, which we have affectionately named rero.Easy to ReconfigureEliminating the tiny screws and nuts is our main objective in making reconfigurable robots a reality. rero accomplished this with the straightforward sliding method between its connectors and joints. We do not even need to fasten a single screw in the entire construction process. This will make the assembling and dismantling of a robot really easy and fast.No Rules in Joining PartsBuilding robots can only be real fun and train your imagination if you do not have to follow the step-by-step instruction manual. The world's first robotic servo in cubical shape with 5 slidable slots helps eliminate the obstructions in robot building. rero provides maximum freedom to users to do any combination they want by joining one part to another.Touch Panel Makes Things DifferentFor the first time ever you see a robot kit which incorporates a 3.2"" color touch screen. This makes rero stand out from other robots in the market. Touch screen allows easier access whereby you do not need to press multiple buttons to play a function. In addition, you can even insert your very own screen wallpaper to make your robot more personalized.Program Your Robot with the Touch of Your Fingertipsrero comes with a ‘Teach Mode’ that can be accessed through the touch panel. You can program a simple movement to your robot without powering up your laptop. This is a very useful and powerful tool especially for those who want to avoid the hassle of computer programming.rero Animator. A Stepping Stone for NovicesUnlike other robot kits, rero does not require a powerful programming language with hundreds of syntaxes. For beginners, they only need the simplest programming tool to help them to program their robots and at the same time facilitate their logical thinking. The custom designed rero Animator does this job perfectly. And it's FREE for download!*rero Animator only supports windows at this phase. We don't have rero Animator for Mac OS and Linux for the initial release. It is on our 
roadmap though, and hopefully we can have something out around the end of Q1 2015. For the time being, Mac users can use virtual machine to run the Windows version of rero Animator.rero is Bluetooth EnabledYou can download rero Remote app to your smart phone (android and iOS) and use it as your remote controller to control rero via Bluetooth. Each button on the app can be customized by assigning a different set of motions to it. Robot fighting can be carried out among your friends with this feature. This Bluetooth enabled feature also means that you can do whatever you want with rero wirelessly.*This is the alpha version of rero Remote UI for functionality test.Inertia Measurement Unit (IMU)rero Controller comes with a 6 DOF IMU. It can be used for orientation, vibration, fall detection, balancing and many other applications. Basically your robot knows when he is in space :)We have created a two wheels balancing robot out of fun by making use of this IMU sensor. IMU reading is not supported by rero Animator for the time being. Only advanced users can manipulate it with the provided API. API for DeveloperWe will provide API for developers to hack or write their own C codes for rero. We encourage advanced users to unleash the full potential of rero by doing so. Print Your Own rero Parts!To bring robot-making to the next level, we even provide 3D CAD drawing for all rero parts. You can modify the existing rero parts or create a new part that you find is interesting and useful for rero and print it using a 3D printer! We also provide a platform for you to showcase your new design at our website. (Thanks to Jun from CR8 for the help to design and print out these parts)He calls him Baby rero Samurai!Technical Specification

TestimonialsHello from Missouri, USAHere is a simple walking robot made by a lucky boy, Sudatta Hor (11 years old) from Rolla, MO, USA. He used 'teach mode' for this walking gait. He will improve the gait with rero Animator soon.World Creative Robotics Challenge (WCRC)We conducted a mini workshop for the kids during WCRC last week. The response from the crowd was so great and encouraging. We really saw: 'The Young Can Build Robot'! Please find out more photos here.What will you get?SwagThis limited edition T-shirt will not be reprinted after this campaign to show that you are so special to us and you have contributed to make rero a success!For The Arduino Community We already have G15 shield for Arduino in our store. It can be used to control the cube servos. We purposely prepare two perks for Arduino users who wish to build simple robots with cube servos. $69 for one G15 shield, two cube servos, two slim wheels and one ball castor to build a mobile robot. $99 for one G15 shield, three cube servos and three U joints to build a 3 DOF arm robot. The G15 shield also comes with ports for Dynamixel servo.Parts listrero starts from a standard set that contains everything you need to build a simple robot with only 8 pcs of Cube Servo and 1 sensor. If you are looking for a more complicated robots with more than 8 DOF (degree of freedom), you can consider the Basic Bundle that combines rero Standard Set and rero Servo Expansion Pack. That will make up a total number of 14 Cube Servos and 1 sensor for your robot! Basic Bundle = rero Standard Set + rero Servo Expansion PackNot satisfied? Then probably you are building an advanced robot that requires more DOF and sensors. We put up rero Standard Set and rero Comprehensive Pack into Complete Bundle to make up a total of 22 Cube Servos and 7 sensors for your system.  Complete Bundle = rero Standard Set + rero Comprehensive Expansion Pack





Production Plan
We have 34 molds which are ready for production in our injection molder factory. We will start fabricating another 9 molds as soon as we achieve our basic goal of $45,000. It will take about 4 months to get these 9 molds working. Injecting the parts will only take 1 to 2 weeks.
At the same time we will start ordering the electronic components and send our controller for lab tests. We fabricate the controller in-house so it wouldn't be a problem for us to improve the circuit based on feedback from the tests.
Our software team will also be working on improving the user experience for rero Animator, rero Remote and rero Controller's interface. 
We estimate we can get all parts and components ready for in-house assembly, testing and packing by late April. We plan to ship out the first batch of rero by early June.

<p>The magnetic stopper interrupts the flow of the solid iron nanospheres and keeps your place during your timeboxing sprint. </p>
<h3>About the Glass</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/biloba-llc/image/upload/v1554533333/Esington-Glass-Solid-Iron-Nanospheres-Time-stopper4_c7gopd.gif"" src=""""/><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Each glass is hand-blown borosilicate glass</i></p>
<p>For Esington 2.0, we are using borosilicate glass (like pyrex). Borosilicate glass is a type of glass that contains boron trioxide which allows for a very low coefficient of thermal expansion. This means it will not crack under extreme temperature changes like regular glass. It's a standard 25 minute timer designed for the Esington timeboxing method (similar to the pomodoro method with a few cue differences). </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554536016/c3dm6lzjd5fwp3l6povi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>4 million solid Iron nanospheres - more than 1 kilogram in each glass</i></p>
<p>For the timing medium, we are using <strong>solid Iron nanospheres</strong>. These work perfectly with the magnetic stopper since they are highly attracted to the embedded magnet. </p>

<h3>Magnetic Silicone Stopper</h3>
<p>The silicone stopper is designed to have a unique feeling and a satisfying soft ""click"" into place to stop the timer. This will make it easy to engrain the ""bookmark for your brain"", and bring you back exactly to where you left off your work when you're ready to resume.</p>

<p>While the stopper is in place, your brain senses incompletion and will subtly pull you back to your work. You will get a satisfying reward when you pull out the stopper and unlock the timer.</p>
<p>We tested the prototypes thousands of stops and they work perfectly every time.</p>
<h3>The Esington Method</h3>
<p>The Esington Method is a timeboxing technique that is similar to the popular pomodoro method, but with a few important cue differences.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off all distractions</li>
<li>Turn over the glass to activate the 3 cues</li>
<li>Work on a single task until your time runs out</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554536686/opgct0iwrkxyksbf7mgd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Soft Stop</h3>
<p>The Esington timer has a “soft stop”.  There are no annoying bells or beeps to signal the end of your cycle.  </p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/biloba-llc/image/upload/v1554533328/Esington-Glass-Solid-Iron-Nanospheres-Time-stopper12_ccylfe.gif"" src=""""/><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>The timer runs out gracefully.</i></p>
<p>Sometimes, your focus can take you well beyond 25 minutes, and that’s ok (especially if working on lower-energy tasks like answering emails).  You don’t want to lose a valuable train of thought.  Just be sure to rest proportionally to the energy spent working.</p>
<h3>Why You Need the Esington Glass</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you’re not using a timeboxing system, this is the perfect way to start. The Esington Glass is simple, beautiful and is built to last. </li>
<li>If you’re currently using a timeboxing system, you need to upgrade your timer.  Esington is beautiful, elegant and unique.  What does your current timer say about you?</li>
<li>Esington 2.0 is the perfect gift for someone you care about.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Design Process</h3>
<p>We made a 3d mockup of the magnetic stopper and then hand-cut a sample out of silicone. </p>

<p>We used solid iron nanospheres to work better with the magnetic stopper. We also found the the solid iron nanospheres worked much better at flowing smoothly because of the smoothness and uniformity of the nanospheres.</p>

</div></div>","At the End of 2014, we introduced the Esington Glass to the world on Kickstarter. With incredible support from the community, the project raised $196,560 with 2272 backers! 
After years of testing and feedback from the community, we're back to solve the biggest problem in timeboxing today: interruptions.
When you get interrupted mid-sprint, you can now stop time. 
 
a new superpower, just for you
""Got my Esington today and I am ecstatic! I can't believe how great you handled everything. I am really impressed and grateful for putting this great idea out to the public... I just can't wait to change my life and discipline myself a step at a time to accomplish what I've always wanted to do."" - Vanessa C, backer of the original Esington glass. 


Help us unlock the free acoustic base! Read more about the sound tests below.
Esington 2.0
Did you know the average worker gets interrupted after only 11 minutes of work? The crazy thing is it takes 25 minutes to get re-focused on the job. 

interruptions suck
With Esington 2.0, the magnetic time-stopper will keep your place in the sprint and act like a bookmark for your brain, waiting to be unleashed to restart your work.
Control Time
We invented a new way to control the time on your glass. Simply place the magnetic stopper over the neck of the glass and the timer stops!
 
a cool new magic trick - stop the flow of iron nanospheres with the silicone magnet
The magnetic stopper interrupts the flow of the solid iron nanospheres and keeps your place during your timeboxing sprint. 
About the Glass
Each glass is hand-blown borosilicate glass
For Esington 2.0, we are using borosilicate glass (like pyrex). Borosilicate glass is a type of glass that contains boron trioxide which allows for a very low coefficient of thermal expansion. This means it will not crack under extreme temperature changes like regular glass. It's a standard 25 minute timer designed for the Esington timeboxing method (similar to the pomodoro method with a few cue differences). 

4 million solid Iron nanospheres - more than 1 kilogram in each glass
For the timing medium, we are using solid Iron nanospheres. These work perfectly with the magnetic stopper since they are highly attracted to the embedded magnet. 

The most beautiful productivity timer ever made
The solid Iron nanospheres flow freely, even after thousands of magnetic stops.  White Noise
Millions of solid iron nanospheres produce a soothing white noise for the first 20 seconds to act as a cue to start your work habit (more on this below).  Here's what it sounds like on different surfaces:  
 
Magnetic Silicone Stopper
The silicone stopper is designed to have a unique feeling and a satisfying soft ""click"" into place to stop the timer. This will make it easy to engrain the ""bookmark for your brain"", and bring you back exactly to where you left off your work when you're ready to resume.

An elegant addition to any executive desk
While the stopper is in place, your brain senses incompletion and will subtly pull you back to your work. You will get a satisfying reward when you pull out the stopper and unlock the timer.
We tested the prototypes thousands of stops and they work perfectly every time.
The Esington Method
The Esington Method is a timeboxing technique that is similar to the popular pomodoro method, but with a few important cue differences.

Turn off all distractions
Turn over the glass to activate the 3 cues
Work on a single task until your time runs out


Soft Stop
The Esington timer has a “soft stop”.  There are no annoying bells or beeps to signal the end of your cycle.   The timer runs out gracefully.
Sometimes, your focus can take you well beyond 25 minutes, and that’s ok (especially if working on lower-energy tasks like answering emails).  You don’t want to lose a valuable train of thought.  Just be sure to rest proportionally to the energy spent working.
Why You Need the Esington Glass

If you’re not using a timeboxing system, this is the perfect way to start. The Esington Glass is simple, beautiful and is built to last. 
If you’re currently using a timeboxing system, you need to upgrade your timer.  Esington is beautiful, elegant and unique.  What does your current timer say about you?
Esington 2.0 is the perfect gift for someone you care about.

The Design Process
We made a 3d mockup of the magnetic stopper and then hand-cut a sample out of silicone. 
 
After a few iterations, it worked perfectly with the iron nanospheres!

We used solid iron nanospheres to work better with the magnetic stopper. We also found the the solid iron nanospheres worked much better at flowing smoothly because of the smoothness and uniformity of the nanospheres.

Specifications
The Large glass is our executive edition: 40% larger and 3x bigger. The Large glass has louder white noise. Both are 25 minute timers. Borosilicate glass with 4 million iron nanospheres.

To show off your glass in an elegant way, we are including a free cork base with each glass. 

 
Timeline and Expectations
July: Early bird orders ship
August: Regular bird orders ship
We have the prototypes ready and have lined up a primary and secondary manufacturer. We have 4 years of experience making these glasses so we are confident we can deliver on time. 
The solid iron nanospheres have been tested thousands of times and we're also confident we can secure high quality material. We also have 4 years experience quality testing these glasses, so we're confident in getting you a great product in a timely fashion. 

Feedback from our first campaign
""I'm going to add to the growing list of glowing reviews. You not only delivered early but also the packaging was outstanding protection. The glasses themselves are even more impressive than I imagined from the photos and I am more than happy with them. You have also been great with your updates and keeping your backers informed. This is how a Kickstarter should be run and I look forward to any future projects from you. Thank you.” - A. Woodham III
“Just opened mine- I was out of town when it arrived. It's beautiful and beyond expectations! Bravo Rudy- like so many others have said, this was an all-time great KS. Can't wait to back your next venture!!“ - Sherri

<br/>Why I made the Tree Table</h3><p>I am a computer programmer, and for decades I had to be indoors in order to work. There was always something missing to make working outdoors a reality. It was either battery power, or the internet, or the sun, or the lack of tables that made it impossible.  But this summer I found all the missing pieces, and finally began working outdoors.<br/><br/>I began by carrying a regular sized table with me, with tall legs (Roll-a-Table).  However, it occurred to me that a regular tree's trunk,  can be thought of as a table leg. By not requiring carrying the legs of the table, the table can be lighter. Second, the table can be mounted on a tree's trunk at any height, allowing to work standing, a variant that I prefer. <br/><br/>I started looking for such a product, but couldn't find one. Instead, I found <a href=""https://patents.google.com/patent/US4409907"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this patent</a> which expired in 2001. So, I decided to make a prototype for myself based on that patent. When I started using it, people stopped, stared, and wondered. They said the Tree Table is a good idea, and that they would buy it. And so, I decided to manufacture it.<br/><br/>You can learn more about me at my <a href=""http://borisreitman.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">borisreitman.com</a> website, and I'm on <a href=""https://twitter.com/borisreitman"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a>, <a href=""https://www.tiktok.com/@borisreitman"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TikTok</a> and <a href=""https://medium.com/@borisreitman"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Medium</a> at @borisreitman .   Also, you can view my <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/boris-reitman-8b2027134/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LinkedIn</a> page.</p><h3>
<br/>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>If you support the campaign at $49, then you will get a copy of the Tree Table.</p><p>As perks, patrons will get a chance to see the plans and to make suggestions.</p><p>How I will use the funds:</p><ul>
<li>The funds will go to produce the parts.</li>
<li>To pay for my own time managing the process of production.</li>
<li>To pay for any necessary consultation with a mechanical engineer about which off-the-shelf parts to use to manufacture at volume and low cost. </li>
</ul><p>I expect that it will take 3 months of work to create production plans and to identify the plants that will produce them. I allocate up to $30,000 for this stage.   This will include fees I must pay to contractors to help me do this. <br/><br/>The remaining $70,000 will be spent to produce 2000 Tree Tables that I would ship to the funders, as the perks.  This means that production cost per table is at most $35. I will choose the kind of materials and production process that enable to produce at such cost.  (Note that funders pay extra $10 per table to cover shipping costs.)</p><p> </p><h3>The Keyboard Shelf</h3><p>The keyboard shelf allows you to have a fully ergonomic setup for working many hours.  This removes the need to carry your on laptop raiser.  You can get the shelf as an add-on perk.<br/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598159984/smyz0xlcnw0mctnyu1k0.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Carrying and Portability</h3><p>The table disassembles and fits into a long bag that is convenient to carry.  Here's a photo of me carrying the prototype.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596820595/yzm1fkmpdhmzrf74r1x2.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The aluminium brace and the frame disassembles completely, and packs tightly.  Because of the L-angle, one fits inside the other.

</div><h3>Tips how to use the Tree Table</h3><p>Here are some tips of how to get the most out of the Tree Table. Watch the video to see how accessories can be used to turn the table into a full ergonomic workstation. In the summer heat working in a tree shade works well. In the Spring and Fall, if it's too cold to work sitting, use a standing position to increase blood circulation. If your fingers get cold, buy regular cotton gloves, and cut off the fingertips.  Drink hot tea and wear a ski-hat to prevent heat from escaping.</p><div><h3> </h3></div><h3>Tree Table Workstation: Bring your own accessories</h3><p>As you see in the video, I turn the Tree Table into a full ergonomic workstation. Here are some tips from my own experience to make the Tree Table your comfortable office for a full day of work.</p><p>Get the Keyboard Shelf to have a fully ergonomic table, without the need to carry your own laptop raiser.<br/><br/>For portable power that would last you a day (with MacBook Pro + LTE), you can use <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Rockpals-250-Watt-Generator-Rechargeable-Emergency/dp/B075SSMR6K/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rockpals 250 Wh</a> lithium battery AC generator. It weighs 5.5 lb and I carry it inside my laptop backpack. (My backpack is the <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Incase-ICON-Slim-Backpack-Anthracite/dp/B01IQXKI40/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Incase ICON Slim</a>.)  If you have a Windows or Linux laptop, rather than a MacBook, you probably don't need extra power for the laptop, but you will need a battery to recharge your mobile phone.</p><p>What about the Internet connection? Save watching YouTube videos for home, and your LTE data plan will last you a month. Also, check with your provider for something called a ""Tablet Plan.""  It's a second SIM card that supports only data, that one would put into a tablet. Instead of a tablet, put it into an older smartphone, and share the hotspot or tether to your laptop. Alternatively, put the data SIM card into a portable travel router which would give you a WiFi connection.</p><p>If you stay within city limits (by using city parks) you will have a strong LTE signal. If you go camping, far from cell towers, you will need to use a cellular signal booster.<br/> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>The Tree Table is an alternative to working in a coffee shop. With Covid-19 lockdowns, many people are trapped home. They also have little time to interact physically with coworkers.  When working in a park, each can be working at a tree far apart. You can also tell your friends to stop by to say hello.<br/><br/>You can also use the Tree Table if you have kids who want to play at a playground, while you want to get some work done. </p><p>There are already tables in some parks, but they are rarely in a shade. With a Tree Table you get automatic shade, and cool in the summer. Thus, the Tree Table can enable more people to get outside, and enjoy the weather.<br/> </p><div>

<p>I have not yet mass produced and shipped a physical product, and I will have to learn on the go. (I am a computer programmer by trade.)<br/> </p>

I will choose the kind of materials and production process that enable to produce at such cost.  (Note that funders pay extra $10 per table to cover shipping costs.) The Keyboard ShelfThe keyboard shelf allows you to have a fully ergonomic setup for working many hours.  This removes the need to carry your on laptop raiser.  You can get the shelf as an add-on perk.  Carrying and PortabilityThe table disassembles and fits into a long bag that is convenient to carry.  Here's a photo of me carrying the prototype.The aluminium brace and the frame disassembles completely, and packs tightly.  Because of the L-angle, one fits inside the other. Note that this is the prototype, the final product will pack even better. 
Dimensions & WeightThe Tree Table 29.5"" wide (75cm), and slightly above 14"" deep (36cm).   When packed, the stacked frame is 78cm long. The prototype weighs 6 lb. (3kg) and is made of light wood and aluminum. With the keyboard shelf, the prototype weighs an additional 2 lb. (1kg). If you don't have an external keyboard with you, you can leave the components for the keyboard shelf at home or in your car, so that it's lighter to carry the table around.The final product will be lighter, since instead of wood planks, I plan to use light aluminum accordion tables, similar to existing camping tables.
Videos of the prototype in useVideo of mounting the Tree Table:Disassembling the tabletop.  (Notice that the table wiggles side-to-side because I have released the side locks at the beginning of the video.) 

 

 
Tips how to use the Tree TableHere are some tips of how to get the most out of the Tree Table. Watch the video to see how accessories can be used to turn the table into a full ergonomic workstation. In the summer heat working in a tree shade works well. In the Spring and Fall, if it's too cold to work sitting, use a standing position to increase blood circulation. If your fingers get cold, buy regular cotton gloves, and cut off the fingertips.  Drink hot tea and wear a ski-hat to prevent heat from escaping. Tree Table Workstation: Bring your own accessoriesAs you see in the video, I turn the Tree Table into a full ergonomic workstation. Here are some tips from my own experience to make the Tree Table your comfortable office for a full day of work.Get the Keyboard Shelf to have a fully ergonomic table, without the need to carry your own laptop raiser.For portable power that would last you a day (with MacBook Pro + LTE), you can use Rockpals 250 Wh lithium battery AC generator. It weighs 5.5 lb and I carry it inside my laptop backpack. (My backpack is the Incase ICON Slim.)  If you have a Windows or Linux laptop, rather than a MacBook, you probably don't need extra power for the laptop, but you will need a battery to recharge your mobile phone.What about the Internet connection? Save watching YouTube videos for home, and your LTE data plan will last you a month. Also, check with your provider for something called a ""Tablet Plan.""  It's a second SIM card that supports only data, that one would put into a tablet. Instead of a tablet, put it into an older smartphone, and share the hotspot or tether to your laptop. Alternatively, put the data SIM card into a portable travel router which would give you a WiFi connection.If you stay within city limits (by using city parks) you will have a strong LTE signal. If you go camping, far from cell towers, you will need to use a cellular signal booster. The ImpactThe Tree Table is an alternative to working in a coffee shop. With Covid-19 lockdowns, many people are trapped home. They also have little time to interact physically with coworkers.  When working in a park, each can be working at a tree far apart. You can also tell your friends to stop by to say hello.You can also use the Tree Table if you have kids who want to play at a playground, while you want to get some work done. There are already tables in some parks, but they are rarely in a shade. With a Tree Table you get automatic shade, and cool in the summer. Thus, the Tree Table can enable more people to get outside, and enjoy the weather. 
Risks & Challenges
I have not yet mass produced and shipped a physical product, and I will have to learn on the go. (I am a computer programmer by trade.) 
Other ways you can help
If you can't contribute financially, you can help me by showing this project to your friends and posting it to your social networks.  You can use Indiegogo ""share"" tools.  Also, the Tree Table has a Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/Tree-Table-10633187451...",4.0,3,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>What is MyCloud?</strong></h2>
<p>If you had a computer that could do anything, what would you have it do?</p>
<p>Host your own website?</p>
<p>Create a file sharing service?</p>
<p>Be an email provider?</p>
<p>Share your pictures, movies and music?</p>
<p>Bring all of the services you pay for on the internet onto your own system so you wouldn't have to pay user or hosting fees?</p>
<p>Conduct your entire business in-house, including having remote access/telework from anywhere in the world with any web enabled device?</p>
<p>How about doing all of these things at the same time on a single, low-cost computer?</p>
<p>We posed the ""what would you have it do"" question to people all over the world and they responded in a very simalar way. </p>
<p>""No more confusing privacy controls, no more big companies or hosting service controlling my information and my access or making me pay monthly fees use it.  I want my own private piece of the internet to create and share whatever and however I want"".</p>
<p>So we got to work designing and building on that idea.</p>
<p>We came up with a platform like no other on the market today, it costs less than a mid-range computer and can do just about anything you want it to.</p>
<p>MyCloud is a scalable, flexible and affordable private cloud networking platform that can host multiple operating systems on the same machine, all running at the same time. Host a website, store and share your filee, photos and music, run your business and applications, create virtual workstations for your users and create a development network for your application developers all on the same single machine and run them all at the same time.</p>
<p>Best of all, you own it!  No more hosting fees, no more third-party data storage/cloud services, no more expensive data centers and no more complicated networks.</p>
<p><img alt=""MyCloud"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sites.google.com/site/reallivemanhost/home/elements/MyCloud%20Visual.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""MyCloud""/></p>
<h3><em><strong>It's your own personal internet!</strong></em></h3>
<p><strong>MyCloud is the simplest way to do everything on one machine</strong>.  The platform is a durable, light weight machine that weighs only about 20 pounds, but it’s powerful enough to host up to 25 different operating systems running at the same time, on the same single machine.  The MyCloud machine can host workstations, servers, domains, websites, storage, or just about anything you need.  It’s designed to be used in any environment, development or production or both,  </p>
<p>No more racks of servers.  No more data centers.  No more application or data hosting services. Just one small computer that can do it all better, faster and more securely.</p>
<p>The MyCloud machine also has core network devices built in.  It has a completely configurable Gig Ethernet router that connects directly to an ISP and a 4 port GIG Ethernet switch for connectivity to a Local Area Network.  The MyCloud machine is also a secure hotspot so local wireless devices can connect to it.</p>
<p>Simply put, it’s a hi-speed  data center, a Local Area Network and Network Area Storage all in one small, light weight machine.  And it’s built on inexpensive and open source software and hardware.</p>
<p>You still have access to the old internet.  MyCloud plugs right into your service provider.  But your information and data is safe and secure on a machine that you control.  You control who has access to it and what level of access they have, or you can just open it up to everyone (though, that’s not recommended).</p>
<p><strong>NEW!: Now you can connect, manage and monitor your MyCloud from an iPhone or Android phone or from your iPad/tablet with a free, simple to use app! </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Application/Uses for MyCloud</strong></h2>
<p>The applications for the MyCloud machine are limitless, but here are a few to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Host your own private social network and share with only those you want to.</li>
<li>Create private file and folder synchronization services (like Dropbox).</li>
<li>Migrate your business from third party hosting services to MyCloud.  Host your website, business applications and LAN on the same machine (The latest prototype has a fully configurable core network and a high speed wireless access point).</li>
<li>Create the next big video sharing service. </li>
<li>Create the ultimate gaming platform for you and your friends.</li>
<li>Host your eCommerce site.</li>
<li>Create your own private cloud (because that’s where things are heading).</li>
</ul><p>These are just a very small sampling of what you can do with it.<strong>  MyCloud can be whatever you want it to be.  It’s only limited by your imagination.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Meet the Design Team</strong></h2>
<p> <img alt=""Insert you"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sites.google.com/site/reallivemanhost/home/elements/Design%20Team.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: baseline;"" title=""Insert you""/></p>
<p><strong><em>YOU</em></strong> are the design team for MyCloud.  Only you are in any position to say what YOU want.  We listened to you when we initially designed this, and we will continue to listen to you as we move forward.  You tell us what you want it to do and we will build it into future designs. The MyCloud is your cloud, after all.  Just tell us your ideas on Twitter<strong> #freemydata</strong> and we will take your ideas and put the best ones into future versions of MyCloud.</p>
<p>We also like to give credit where credit is due,  Have a great idea for MyCloud?  If enough people like it, we will build it in MyCloud with you as the lead designer!</p>
<p>You can also email your ideas to itsmyidea@inevolvesb.com.</p>
<p>Be sure to include your name and valid email address to we can give you credit.</p>
<h2><strong>Where we are now</strong></h2>
<p>Currently we have built the final prototype and we have established and finalized partnerships with VMware, Microsoft, HP, Cisco and a manufacturing company to built and manufacture the MyCloud machine.</p>
<h2><strong>What’s next</strong></h2>
<p>There are costs associated with mass-producing this machine, but they are very low. We built the prototypes on a shoe string budget (old computer parts and a tax refund).  Now we need to produce a final product and bring it to market.  We have no doubt that once this gets out to owners, it will change the world. </p>
<p>We are excited about this system and will do whatever it takes (days, nights, weekends and holidays) to finish it and get it ready to free people from the big tech companies that control the internet no later than the beginning of the first quarter 2013 (January).</p>
<p>Your support of this project will help us build the final product and get it ready and shipping.</p>
<p>This is about getting a truly innovative product in the hands of every computer user on the planet.  We want to start shipping as soon as humanly possible because the 3rd cloud computing cycle is about to end.  And when it does, your personal data that is stored on it goes with it.  You will need to free it before it does or it will belong to everyone (just like the last 2 times when it happened).</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Nowadays, a group of people with similar interests is generally called ‘a community’. For us, the definition of ‘community’ implies rules and restrictions. We believe that good/unique ideas and pieces of work can be created only without adhering to rules. Be wild and free! That’s why we are called Tribe of Inspiration. When saying ‘Tribe’, we imagine something wild and savage. That’s who we are!</p>
<p>We are honoured to introduce you to Planner by the Tribe of Inspiration. No more post-its and missing scribble notes! Everything that’s important can finally be found in one journal!</p>
<p>This planner is for everyone: managers, designers, teachers, and even stay-at-home moms!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Nowadays, a group of people with similar interests is generally called ‘a community’. For us, the definition of ‘community’ implies rules and restrictions. We believe that good/unique ideas and pieces of work can be created only without adhering to rules. Be wild and free! That’s why we are called Tribe of Inspiration. When saying ‘Tribe’, we imagine something wild and savage. That’s who we are!
We are honoured to introduce you to Planner by the Tribe of Inspiration. No more post-its and missing scribble notes! Everything that’s important can finally be found in one journal!
This planner is for everyone: managers, designers, teachers, and even stay-at-home moms!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why we need your support</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>By now you’re probably asking why we’re doing this crowdfunding campaign if we have a finished product.</p>
<p>Well, the first reason is that since our launch in 2019, we have gathered a lot of feedback from the companies already using our tool.</p>
<p>And even though we received a lot of positive feedback for our simple and user friendly UI, the companies have been asking for new features.</p>
<p>This demand lead to us to renewing the whole software. And development costs a lot of money.</p>
<p>We already applied for government funding here in Finland, which we got this year, and we have already gathered enough funds to complete about 70% of the new requested features.</p>
<p>According to our calculations, we are still short of 30.000-40.000 euros to complete the demands. </p>
<p>The second reason is that we also want to help and serve companies in other countries and expanding into new markets is not that easy.</p>
<p>We really hope you will back us on our campaign. If you can chip in and donate thank you so much!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>

<p>Our team has extensive experience in developing software so we do not see any issues moving forward in this regard.</p>
<p>We aim to provide rewards as scheduled, however, please understand that delays may occur due to supply chain or quality control issues.</p>
<p>We know this is an ambitious target but one which we truly believe is achievable with our team in place.

Since then, the founders have been far from idle. Instead, they have been eagerly improving and are now ready to launch ANGL.TV, with the knowledge collected during the years the ANGL app has been active. Social media platforms aren’t interested in providing you cross-platform access to live streams, and overall in providing the top live streams from the millions of them.

Live streams flow from everywhere to ANGL.TV, just for you to add your ECHO to the streams you like. With your ECHO you vote for the best ones to stay on for longer. But without ECHOes, the live stream must go. We're not storing uninteresting videos that nobody gives an — ECHO.</p><p>We offer the fastest news flow with a time-saving algorithm. And the icing on the cake is that it's a worldwide experience. Our interface is the newest and most fun way of keeping up with the best stories across the web. The renewed ANGL is very smart-and-special: our Artificial Intelligence system memorizes your interests and offers you the most exciting top live streams in a non-invasive yet personalized way.

Since then, the founders have been far from idle. Instead, they have been eagerly improving and are now ready to launch ANGL.TV, with the knowledge collected during the years the ANGL app has been active. Social media platforms aren’t interested in providing you cross-platform access to live streams, and overall in providing the top live streams from the millions of them. This is why we have created this platform-independent site: to have a great live stream adventure for people who don't want to miss out on the biggest stories. The most effective way of accessing the top live streamsANGL.TV is not a prison for videos. We are collecting only the hottest content on Earth: user-generated live streams. It is just so much more complex and interesting. Live streams flow from everywhere to ANGL.TV, just for you to add your ECHO to the streams you like. With your ECHO you vote for the best ones to stay on for longer. But without ECHOes, the live stream must go. We're not storing uninteresting videos that nobody gives an — ECHO.We offer the fastest news flow with a time-saving algorithm. And the icing on the cake is that it's a worldwide experience. Our interface is the newest and most fun way of keeping up with the best stories across the web. The renewed ANGL is very smart-and-special: our Artificial Intelligence system memorizes your interests and offers you the most exciting top live streams in a non-invasive yet personalized way. Using ANGL.TV WorldView you can participate the coolest event and save time at the same time. Amazing, right?! Missing out on the most significant events? With ANGL.TV WorldView it is not an option! You can be wherever, whenever and you can know whatever you want to.  With ANGL.TV You can attend the most notable events in the world in real time and experience them with the local video creators and the live streams. So you can experience the stories - whether from a coffee house sipping a latte macchiato or from the comfort of your bed. Be wherever in the world, whenever you want with the ANGL.TV website. But the list of innovations do not stop here. We are working on the world’s first live stream system with API. The ANGL Open Api is a special function - the live stream providers can integrate their videos to our system. Soon according to our plans you can find all the available and exciting streams in a personalized way on ANGL.TV!  5 reasons to support ANGL.TV on Indiegogo 1. Joy of unexpectedness.ANGL.TV WorldView is the next level. It's the future of having fun online and watching news at the same time. Yes, we know live streams sometimes can be boring - but not in our system. You can count on that. 2. Getting the top stories first-hand.There are sites which focus on videos, but until now there hasn’t been an interface such as ANGL.TV, which works with the top live streams. In every topic. 3. You create the news.Watching live streams isn’t the same as watching just everyday videos. It happens real-time and what is more, you can also participate in it real time and talk to the live stream creator. You are really the part of it, you can lead the direction of the live stream. 4. Easy-to-find live content of your choice.We offer a personalized flow of live content.

ANGL.TV WorldView is a huge initiative - but it could become bigger still.   Meet the people behind ANGL.TVAndrás Kövécs, the founder of ANGL has been active in the area of live streaming for 10 years.

EVERYTHING.It is made for nonprofit centric people at every level.
Directors
Paid and Volunteer Staff
Board Members
Regular Volunteers
And More!
 The EXPLORE MORE NONPROFIT PLANNER is a 6-month, undated planner (and yes the image above is a TRUE prototype) that allows you to build on the passion you have for the nonprofit you love. It challenges you to look at all aspects of your nonprofit, helps you organize the nonprofit's work, also helps you track personal tasks and creative endeavors!  It is composed of:
1x  6-Month Planner - See your entire 6 months and plan weeks in advance. Size is 9.25 (tall) by 6.25 (wide).
6 Monthly Spreads - Plan for the current and upcoming month. See what's happening right now and look back on what you have accomplished. 
26x Weeks - Organize your tasks and events in detail for the current and upcoming week. Each day of the week has a dedicated FULL page!
6 Goal Planning Spreads - Track your goals, stay motivated, and improve your overall success.   
Lined and Dot-Grid Note Pages -  Includes 20 lined pages and 20 dot-grid pages for you to use however you need.
 Get one for yourself and for all of those who are ready to explore more and take your nonprofit forward.Why is this being marketed through Indiegogo? The planner is already fully designed and a prototype has been produced. But before we can go into mass production we need support to help fund the remainder of the project. The goal we need to reach is just $4,500.00 in total and then we will be able to move to production.  Read more about Indiegogo in the FAQ section.  Sneak Peak at Planner SpreadsWe kick things off with a few WHO YOU ARE spreads. This allows you to take time to evaluate who you are as a nonprofit. What you do great at. What you might need to improve. We ask you questions so you can reflect. This helps get you in the right place and start determining some of the key areas you might want to focus on._______________________________________________________________________ We have a dedicated spread for each of the five core areas. These core area spreads contain the weekly activities you will be prompted to turn to throughout the planner.  We have set the planner up so that one week you focus on EXPLORE and that will prompt you to turn to the EXPLORE spread to complete an activity. The next week might be a motivational quote or quick activity or a goal check week. The weeks alternate so that every other week you will have a main core activity that relates to BRAND, PEOPLE, EXPERIENCE, PARTNERS, or EXPLORE and that is followed by something motivational or a quick activity._______________________________________________________________________ After the core area spreads we have six goal spreads. These are not spreads where you simply write down a goal. We will help you break the goal down so you can really understand what it will take to accomplish the goal. Ultimately making it actionable and rewarding._______________________________________________________________________Here is a peek at the weekly/daily layout. Each week starts with either an activity related to one of the five core areas, a motivation quote, a quick activity, or is dedicated for a goal check-in week. After the weekly introduction page, each day of the week (Mon-Sun) has a dedicated page for you to manage and own the day!_______________________________________________________________________ MORE THAN A PLANNER THOUGHOf course you can handle normal task tracking and appointments with this planner, but that is not the core focus. The focus is on motivating you and to get you thinking outside of the box for your nonprofit. This all starts with ""WHO YOU ARE.""
Who is your nonprofit?
What is the vision/mission?
Strengths?
Opportunities? 
Once we can lay the foundation, we can start digging deeper. This planner has been created around five core areas: BRAND, PEOPLE. EXPERIENCE, PARTNERS, and EXPLORE. What’s the story behind these core areas? We wanted more than just a task tracking planner. We wanted to create a method, a flow that would truly create motivation and action and growth. So after our research and brainstorming and holding focus groups we determined five core areas that we could tie everything back to.  FIVE CORE AREAS 101BRAND - Brand is how the world sees your organization and the work you do. Brand is the ability to build a loyal tribe.PEOPLE - Having the right people in the right places means everything. Ensuring those people are inspired, committed, and invested in your nonprofit’s success can bring more success than any one strategy. EXPERIENCE - Every interaction creates a different experience for your followers. From your website to your social accounts to your events, and more—every touch point means something.PARTNERS - Who is in your village? Who can you add? Who can you learn from? Are you networking in the community? What actions do you take to be a good partner?EXPLORE - There is always room to improve and think outside of the box. The EXPLORE section is all about going down paths you have not gone down before to take your nonprofit to new heights. Get ready to EXPLORE and create some magic.    Check Out The Planner with Co-Creator Ashley  MEET THE CREATORS: SHAWN AND ASHLEYThere are 1,000’s and 1,000’s of planners and journals out there.

<h3>FOREWORD</h3>
<p>Hi, please let me introduce myself, I'm Fery Hartono, the founder of my current business - Business Excellence Consulting and the founder of the future ELbiz Business Problem-Solving Guide Platform. I already established Business Excellence Consulting 18 years ago and have  served more than 200 companies, ranging from Small to Medium Businesses, State-Owned Companies, Large Companies/Corporations with Local and Global Scale (you can find out more about our details in our website <a href=""http://www.business-excellence.co.id"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.business-excellence.co.id</a>). Our core services in business consulting are business plan development, new business design, organisation alignment, business process improvement and human capital management.</p>
<p>Let us talk about Indonesia, my country. With around 262 million people (2017), Indonesia is one of the largest economy and fastest growing countries in Asia, where these people are well familiar with smartphone and internet. There are 143,26 million smartphone users and 100 million internet users across Indonesia, with more than 40% of the population itself (107 million people) are working in Micro Businesses and Small to Medium Enterprise (SME). According to Ministry of Cooperative and Small - Medium Enterprises (2017), there are more than 59,2 million of Micro Businesses &amp; Small to Medium Enterprises in Indonesia.</p>
<p>After 18 years working as a business consultant here, I realized that there is a gap between big companies and Micro Businesses &amp; SME in terms of business best practices. Big companies can often engage in local &amp; global consulting firms, training providers as well as market research companies to improve their capability to sustain the growth of their business. In comparison, Micro Businesses and SME have limited budget to build up their skill, knowledge and capability about management.</p>
<p>My experience of encountering different types of business problems as a business consultant encourage our consultant team to take the initiative to fill this gap by creating ELbiz as Business Problem-Solving Guide Platform for Micro Businesses and SME in Indonesia. We are going to provide an online business Problem-Solving Guide Platform that is easy to be accessed and at a very affordable price. Furthermore, we are going to develop it using our years of experience in business consulting which is supported by our consultant team.</p>

THE CONDITIONS of Micro Businesses and SME in Indonesia  



Micro Businesses and SME can not afford to engage business and management consulting (local & global consulting) to improve their business and management performance.
Micro Businesses and SME owner commonly face difficulties in areas of marketing, sales, operation, logistic, human resource, accounting & finance as well as business development because they do not get enough best practice knowledge to fix their problem. Therefore, their insufficient knowledge about business best practice will always position big companies ahead of them.
They have limited budget for people development, organisation development, and system management as well IT implementation.
Big companies have advance knowledge when it comes to managing their business since they are able to engage business & management consulting firms to solve their business problem, strengthen their competitiveness, and maneuver their business development. On top of that, they have bigger capital, stronger network for financing, professional management team, strong organisation culture, advance facilities for product development and capable team for business development, which make them grow faster compared to Micro Businesses and SME.

Then, how do we bring the value of business best practice to Micro Businesses and SME society?
Our PROJECT MISSION

Although the outcome might not be in the same level as having direct consulting activities from consulting firm, we believe that our experience and capability can contribute to assist Micro Businesses and SME society with business best practice.
We have a moral obligation to assist Micro Businesses and SME society in Indonesia that do not have an opportunity to improve their business & management skills due to their limited budget.
We want Micro Businesses and SME to get business best practice similar to the knowledge obtained by big companies in more affordable price.
Improve the capability of Micro Businesses and SME society in Indonesia in terms of managing, sustaining and growing their business.

<p><strong>SINGKEY Fabrication</strong></p>
<p> The SINGKEY is machined via Water-jet technology from Titanium or Ultra Steel material right here in US. Once the material is cut into the desired shape, tumbling technique is used to give a smooth and polish finish. Finally to give a desired color to Ultra steel SINGKEY, Zinc color coating technique is used. The Zinc coating acts like a paint, making SINGKEY several times more durable depending on Zinc layer thickness. For the hardware assembly, we have used our local hardware store for easy assembly accessibility. Therefore for replacement parts, or to lengthen the SINGKEY you can always buy screws from us or any local hardware store. Our SINGKEY are designed to fit almost any common set of keys by adding longer screws. <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/714/531/eacacf7081e6099678f3b12beb0b63ee_large.png?1372730479"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Design History</strong></p>
<p> Two months ago, we started with a simple sketch figuring out the innovative way to replace the old fashion key chains. After couple of iterations we moved on to 2D/3D model of the SINGKEY. For the initial prototype, we partner up with the local manufactures houses here in California, US. After all that hard work here we are with a personal stylish key organizer which is strong, durable, &amp;light weight with bottle &amp; can opener features.<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/710/160/22a8528f90a837565e6cde58f9cd1af8_large.png?1372574899"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/714/534/11ed9d8f75a1bab4fc6b6bd8ecf91b8f_large.png?1372730559"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/714/542/64b6e822c0bc40bac1b0781d55591fc0_large.png?1372730763"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h1>Project Status and Timeline</h1>
<p>The company office is approximately 2000SF located in Roseville, CA, just outside Sacramento. We currently have working prototypes of the hardware and software components of the MAVRIC Matchbox and MAVRIC Cloud that you are backing as part of this Kickstarter project. We have conducted field tests with companies, and have a group of beta testers for our products. We are confident that we can deliver on our project.  Our software is an application that runs on the Linux operating system. It is developed completely in house by our own software team, and we have a well documented API (application programming interface) we can use to integrate our application with others. If MAVRIC's project is funded we have the expertise to continue developing our own software. We have development relationships with several hardware manufacturers that supply industry standard hardware that runs our software application. We have the technical expertise to develop our own hardware, but have chosen to use the Ionics plug computer platform for the Matchbox hardware.  See more about the Matchbox hardware in the manufacturing plan.</p>

<h1>Manufacturing Plan</h1>
<p>It's not good business to develop hardware when the ideal plug computer platforms work great and make our project so affordable.  After testing practically every plug computing device on the market, we made an alliance with Ionics-EMS,  a well established company in the Philippines. Ionics has several manufacturing operations around the world, and has a development office in Silicon Valley. </p>
<p>We have an agreement with Ionics that allows us to make the MAVRIC Matchbbox available in large volumes on a global basis. The first product shipments will be to the US Only, with International shipments later. Ionics will install and test our software at the Ionics factory. The product warranty is backed by Ionics so unlike other hardware projects from small companies the MAVRIC matchbox hardware platform is built on an industry standard chip, and operating system, which our application runs on. The warranty support comes from both MAVRIC Media and from Ionics-EMS, our hardware manufacturing partner. For more information about Ionics, go to <a href=""http://www.ionics-ems.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ionics-ems.com</a> where you can see detailed information about their manufacturing and integration capabilities.</p>

<p>MAVRIC Media is a hardware and software development company based in Sacramento, Ca., about 120 miles north of Silicon Valley. We're a small dedicated team of MAVRIC's (not where our name came from) and we have created the worlds most simple, most secure, inexpensive way to send data files of any size anywhere in the world. We believe in it so much, we have worked without pay, self funded the development of our invention, and paid the legal bills to protect our invention.  We have gained the support of some major companies that have helped us get us to this point, and are ready to help us after launch.</p>
<p>We have been dealing with large data files most of our careers and have developed successful technical projects before. We have tremendous experience with moving large data files and built one of the first web based solutions a few years ago, but it was ahead of is time. Now, the problem of sending and receiving large data files, and how to secure them is known to everyone. The hardware is now available in a handheld device that is affordable, and our years of software development is almost complete.</p>
<p>Sure we know people in Silicon Valley. Sure we have sent business plans to large companies that are very interested in what we are doing. Meanwhile, we continue to work toward our goal. We have built prototypes and tested them with companies like Ionics-EMS, Disney, Sprint and others. Recently, CEO Don Smith was interviewed on MoneyTV and sent a DVD size file across the country during the course of the interview. Then we took on a bigger challenge and sucessfully sent a 500GB file (about 125DVD's) from Los Angeles to China for an international company. The MAVRIC Matchbox (and our tech team up all night watching) sent the file successfully in just over 40 hours over standard internet connections, a full 3 days ahead of the same information sent by FEDEX. We Win !</p>
<p>We're proud to call the MAVRIC Matchbox a  ""Send it and Forget it"" solution for your real-world data problems: files too large for email attachments, the hassle, costs, insecurity, time-delay, and fees of other services. We knew there had to be a better way, so the <i>Matchbox</i> was started. </p>
<p>Now, we are taking our story to the street and the kickstarter backers to help us finish the MAVRIC Matchbox project and make it available to everyone. </p>
<h1>Our story and our team</h1>
<p>The original founders of MAVRIC Media are a close knit team, with digital media industry roots tracing back to Ampex Corporation, where the videotape recorder was invented and where they all worked early in their careers. In the 1990's, they teamed up at an Intel funded startup, Asset Factory, where they pioneered the concept of an online digital media service bureau and developed proprietary network rendering technology used by Hollywood film and special effects companies.  The company was acquired by NewTek, Inc. (a leading 3D software company). While at Asset factory, they did early work in the field of media asset management and developed concepts which were years ahead of their time.</p>
<p>In 2008, the core team re-assembled to build a media asset management system for the State of California Department of Education Star Testing Program.</p>

<p><br/></p></span><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Shortly after they introduced the first implementation of the MAVRIC Matchbox, a media asset management system in a small ITX form factor computer (which costs $2500) at that time. It was introduced at the Siggraph show in 2008 and </span><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">won</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> awards for innovation in the new product category.</span></p>

<p>Determined that sending video files and big data files would eventually be a really big problem to create a giant business opportunity, cofounder Don Smith worked with Ryan ""Whiz Kid"" Sundberg to keep the company's vision alive. They wanted to see if there was a better, cheaper way, and could they make money at it.  In 2011 they went to Garland Bell, an early MAVRIC investor, and an outstanding attorney, and convinced him to join us as Chief Operating Officer and Corporate Counsel. Bell and Smith have funded MAVRIC Media's ongoing development and operations.  Martha Bossley, also an investor in MAVRIC and veteran Logitech global supply chain director also believed in the matchbox and helped solidify the company's manufacturing partnership with Ionics and others. Martha has managed hundreds of millions in revenue with manufacturing and supply chain companies around the globe. In the recent months many others have worked countless hours without compensation to get the company visible, and the MAVRIC Matchbox to where it is today.</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<p><b>What platforms will the Mavric MatchBox support?</b></p>
<p>The Mavric MatchBox is an application built in Linux.  It’s functionality is accessed through a web browser. The software itself is not downloaded to the client’s computer, enabling the Matchbox to work with all operating systems as well as mobile devices.</p>
<p><b>What are the network requirements to use a Mavric MatchBox?</b></p>
<p>The Matchbox requires only your standard internet connection.</p>
<p>The MatchBox  can connect to your network over Ethernet or Wi-Fi (optional Wi-Fi adapter required), but initial setup requires a wired connection. MatchBox works with all common Wi-Fi networks (802.11b/g/n at 2.4 or 5 GHz) and a number of common security protocols, including Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), WEP 64/128bit, WPA /WAP2, and WPA-PSK /WPA2-PSK.</p>
<p><b>How Secure is the Matchbox and will it protect my privacy ?  </b></p>
<p>The <b>Mavric Matchbox</b> is, in our opinion, is the most secure way to protect your data. As your data file is imported or copied to the Matchbox to be sent, it is encrypted using our patent pending 2048 bit distributed encryption system. That’s about 10 times the best encryption typically used for securing  information. The encryption key is generated inside the matchbox itself, or the MAVRIC Cloud virtual matchbox. There are no third parties that see your data – ever – and your file is 100% totally secure between you and your recipient.  Once the file is received by the recipient matchbox, the decryption sequence is initiated and the encryption key is verified. Your data files are encrypted both on the disk itself, and during the transport of the file over any network – wired, wireless, or mobile.</p>
<p>In addition, since a third party server never holds MAVRIC’s 2048 bit encryption key, the<b>MAVRIC Matchbox</b> is not vulnerable to hackers and data being compromised.</p>
<p><b>How do I setup the Matchbox on my Network ?</b></p>
<p>We have a detailed installation program and product manual that will ship with the MAVRIC Matchbox.</p>
<p><b>Do I have to install the MAVRIC Matchbox Software on any computer that accesses it ?</b></p>
<p>The MAVRIC Matchbox software is embedded in the Matchbox / Ionics plug computer hardware. It is accessed by a web based control panel thru your brower. Unlike other systems we do not install a software application on your computer because it slows your computer down by up to 40% to send a large data files. Secondly, if you are on a laptop, you may have to leave and take your laptop with you. The MAVRIC Matchbox completely offloads the heavy lifting task of encrypting and sending your data file so your computer is free to work on other things.  The MAVRIC Cloud, is a virtual matchbox in our secure data centers and is also accessed by your web browser.</p>
<p><b>Will the matchbox affect other devices on my network ?</b></p>
<p>If you have other devices on your network now, you have probably noticed that some web browsing gets slower when everyone tries to use your internet connection at once. This has become less of a problem as internet connection speeds to the home and business has gotten faster.  The matchbox sends and receives large files quickly because our MAVRICnet system optimizes the speed of your network to get every ounce of power from your internet connection. The matchbox software control panel has advanced configuration capability to manually adjust the available bandwidth among devices including the matchbox.</p>
<p><b>What is MAVRICnet ?</b></p>
<p>MAVRICnet is part of MAVRIC Media’s magic formula for sending practically any size file, without failure to any other matchbox in the world. Basically, MAVRICnet accelerates your file transfer speed every time the same file is sent to another incremental matchbox device. For example if Matchbox #1 sends a 5GB file to Matchbox #2, the transfer will be optimized and sent directly to the receiving Matchbox (#2).  If the same file is then sent to a third, forth, etc. matchbox users, MAVRICnet opens multiple parallel data streams and sends the file faster and faster – in most cases up to 75X faster. If the file being sent exists on multiple matchboxes and one loses power or its connection, the other matchboxes on MAVRICnet automatically complete the transfer.  If the file being sent exists on only 1 matchbox and it loses power or its network connection, when you plug it back in, MAVRICnet knows where the file was interrupted and picks up where it left off.</p>
<p><b>Where does the Matchbox store my files?</b></p>
<p>The Matchbox imports data files from through web based dashboard which allows a file to be “drag and drop” , or selected from a computer hard drive, flash drive, etc.  The matchbox excrypts the file during import and stores it on optional storage -  internal SD card, and flash drive or hard drive via USB port on the Matchbox.</p>
<p>The matchbox is not like other  so called “ personal cloud” solutions. We don’t require you to make the Matchbox the primary storage device for your data files, although it certainly can be.  Often, the user’s applications in a program like Adobe Photoshop create hundreds of files associated with a project and we feel that is best performed on the user’s computer. Once completed and ready to send, the file is copied and stored on the matchbox or to the MAVRIC Cloud Virtual Matchbox. The user has options available to manage how long the particular file remains on their matchbox storage.</p>
<p><b>Is there a limit on how much data a Matchbox user can send per month ?</b></p>
<p>The MAVRIC Matchbox plug and desktop models utilize the owners existing broadband internet connection. Some Internet Service Providers limit the amount of data a particular account can use, but the Matchbox has no data restrictions</p>
<p>The MAVRIC Cloud virtual matchbox is a subscription based account utilizing the resources of Mavric Media. There will be a tiered subscription price that is derived from the amount of storage, and the amount of data throughput the user wants. Pricing has not been finalized, but we expect the subscription to be competitively priced with superior features to any other cloud subscription service.</p>
<p><b>Is there a limit to how many users I can have on my MAVRIC Matchbox?</b></p>
<p>The Matchbox plug and desktop models allow you to have up to 10 user accounts per device.</p>
<p>The MAVRIC Cloud virtual matchbox is limited to one user per subscription account at the launch of the service.</p>
<p><b>Can I send a file to someone who does not have a MatchBox?</b></p>
<p> The short answer is Yes!, using our secure MavricCloud , file recipients can log in with a unique user ID and password , able to view only the file directly sent. </p>
<p>The longer answer is still  Yes, although we have designed the Mavric MatchBox to send files from MatchBox to MatchBox or MAVRIC Cloud Virtual Matchbox.  Each Matchbox can add additional user accounts and send files between user accounts on an individual matchbox, with certain restrictions. </p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>POTENTIAL RISKS: The company does not fund it's campaign or raise adequate capital.</p>
<p>HOW WE'VE MITIGATED THESE RISKS: We have set our project funding goal so we can meet all commitments to deliver our solution and support it for a full year. The key members of the company have made major investments of time and their own money. We are fully committed to MAVRIC Media's success.</p>
<p>HOW WE'VE OVERCOME SIMILAR CHALLENGES IN THE PAST: We never Quit. We define the problem, we come up with unique solutions that others have not thought of, and we work the problems until we win !</p>
<p>SECONDARY ISSUES: ('cause we're just that thorough!) <br/>We are working with hardware manufacturers to ensure our desktop matchbox and mobile network modules receive certifications required to ship those products in the US and abroad. This could take 90-120 days.</p>
<p>WORST CASE SCENARIO: <br/>Since we have self funded this project, tested it extensively, we know we can deliver it. We don't forsee a scenario where we cannot meet our promises.</p>
<p>HOW WE ARE PREPARED TO RESOLVE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS: <br/>If you are not satisfied with our products or services, we will refund your pledge.</p>

Project Status and Timeline
The company office is approximately 2000SF located in Roseville, CA, just outside Sacramento. We currently have working prototypes of the hardware and software components of the MAVRIC Matchbox and MAVRIC Cloud that you are backing as part of this Kickstarter project. We have conducted field tests with companies, and have a group of beta testers for our products. We are confident that we can deliver on our project.  Our software is an application that runs on the Linux operating system. It is developed completely in house by our own software team, and we have a well documented API (application programming interface) we can use to integrate our application with others. If MAVRIC's project is funded we have the expertise to continue developing our own software. We have development relationships with several hardware manufacturers that supply industry standard hardware that runs our software application. We have the technical expertise to develop our own hardware, but have chosen to use the Ionics plug computer platform for the Matchbox hardware.  See more about the Matchbox hardware in the manufacturing plan.

We're proud to call the MAVRIC Matchbox a  ""Send it and Forget it"" solution for your real-world data problems: files too large for email attachments, the hassle, costs, insecurity, time-delay, and fees of other services. We knew there had to be a better way, so the Matchbox was started. 
Now, we are taking our story to the street and the kickstarter backers to help us finish the MAVRIC Matchbox project and make it available to everyone. 
Our story and our team
The original founders of MAVRIC Media are a close knit team, with digital media industry roots tracing back to Ampex Corporation, where the videotape recorder was invented and where they all worked early in their careers. In the 1990's, they teamed up at an Intel funded startup, Asset Factory, where they pioneered the concept of an online digital media service bureau and developed proprietary network rendering technology used by Hollywood film and special effects companies.  The company was acquired by NewTek, Inc. (a leading 3D software company). While at Asset factory, they did early work in the field of media asset management and developed concepts which were years ahead of their time.
In 2008, the core team re-assembled to build a media asset management system for the State of California Department of Education Star Testing Program.





Shortly after they introduced the first implementation of the MAVRIC Matchbox, a media asset management system in a small ITX form factor computer (which costs $2500) at that time. It was introduced at the Siggraph show in 2008 and won awards for innovation in the new product category.


Determined that sending video files and big data files would eventually be a really big problem to create a giant business opportunity, cofounder Don Smith worked with Ryan ""Whiz Kid"" Sundberg to keep the company's vision alive. They wanted to see if there was a better, cheaper way, and could they make money at it.  In 2011 they went to Garland Bell, an early MAVRIC investor, and an outstanding attorney, and convinced him to join us as Chief Operating Officer and Corporate Counsel. Bell and Smith have funded MAVRIC Media's ongoing development and operations.  Martha Bossley, also an investor in MAVRIC and veteran Logitech global supply chain director also believed in the matchbox and helped solidify the company's manufacturing partnership with Ionics and others. Martha has managed hundreds of millions in revenue with manufacturing and supply chain companies around the globe. In the recent months many others have worked countless hours without compensation to get the company visible, and the MAVRIC Matchbox to where it is today.

Frequently Asked Questions
What platforms will the Mavric MatchBox support?
The Mavric MatchBox is an application built in Linux.  It’s functionality is accessed through a web browser. The software itself is not downloaded to the client’s computer, enabling the Matchbox to work with all operating systems as well as mobile devices.
What are the network requirements to use a Mavric MatchBox?
The Matchbox requires only your standard internet connection.
The MatchBox  can connect to your network over Ethernet or Wi-Fi (optional Wi-Fi adapter required), but initial setup requires a wired connection. MatchBox works with all common Wi-Fi networks (802.11b/g/n at 2.4 or 5 GHz) and a number of common security protocols, including Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), WEP 64/128bit, WPA /WAP2, and WPA-PSK /WPA2-PSK.
How Secure is the Matchbox and will it protect my privacy ?  
The Mavric Matchbox is, in our opinion, is the most secure way to protect your data. As your data file is imported or copied to the Matchbox to be sent, it is encrypted using our patent pending 2048 bit distributed encryption system. That’s about 10 times the best encryption typically used for securing  information. The encryption key is generated inside the matchbox itself, or the MAVRIC Cloud virtual matchbox. There are no third parties that see your data – ever – and your file is 100% totally secure between you and your recipient.  Once the file is received by the recipient matchbox, the decryption sequence is initiated and the encryption key is verified. Your data files are encrypted both on the disk itself, and during the transport of the file over any network – wired, wireless, or mobile.
In addition, since a third party server never holds MAVRIC’s 2048 bit encryption key, theMAVRIC Matchbox is not vulnerable to hackers and data being compromised.
How do I setup the Matchbox on my Network ?
We have a detailed installation program and product manual that will ship with the MAVRIC Matchbox.
Do I have to install the MAVRIC Matchbox Software on any computer that accesses it ?
The MAVRIC Matchbox software is embedded in the Matchbox / Ionics plug computer hardware. It is accessed by a web based control panel thru your brower. Unlike other systems we do not install a software application on your computer because it slows your computer down by up to 40% to send a large data files. Secondly, if you are on a laptop, you may have to leave and take your laptop with you. The MAVRIC Matchbox completely offloads the heavy lifting task of encrypting and sending your data file so your computer is free to work on other things.  The MAVRIC Cloud, is a virtual matchbox in our secure data centers and is also accessed by your web browser.
Will the matchbox affect other devices on my network ?
If you have other devices on your network now, you have probably noticed that some web browsing gets slower when everyone tries to use your internet connection at once. This has become less of a problem as internet connection speeds to the home and business has gotten faster.  The matchbox sends and receives large files quickly because our MAVRICnet system optimizes the speed of your network to get every ounce of power from your internet connection. The matchbox software control panel has advanced configuration capability to manually adjust the available bandwidth among devices including the matchbox.
What is MAVRICnet ?
MAVRICnet is part of MAVRIC Media’s magic formula for sending practically any size file, without failure to any other matchbox in the world. Basically, MAVRICnet accelerates your file transfer speed every time the same file is sent to another incremental matchbox device. For example if Matchbox #1 sends a 5GB file to Matchbox #2, the transfer will be optimized and sent directly to the receiving Matchbox (#2).  If the same file is then sent to a third, forth, etc. matchbox users, MAVRICnet opens multiple parallel data streams and sends the file faster and faster – in most cases up to 75X faster. If the file being sent exists on multiple matchboxes and one loses power or its connection, the other matchboxes on MAVRICnet automatically complete the transfer.  If the file being sent exists on only 1 matchbox and it loses power or its network connection, when you plug it back in, MAVRICnet knows where the file was interrupted and picks up where it left off.
Where does the Matchbox store my files?
The Matchbox imports data files from through web based dashboard which allows a file to be “drag and drop” , or selected from a computer hard drive, flash drive, etc.  The matchbox excrypts the file during import and stores it on optional storage -  internal SD card, and flash drive or hard drive via USB port on the Matchbox.
The matchbox is not like other  so called “ personal cloud” solutions. We don’t require you to make the Matchbox the primary storage device for your data files, although it certainly can be.  Often, the user’s applications in a program like Adobe Photoshop create hundreds of files associated with a project and we feel that is best performed on the user’s computer. Once completed and ready to send, the file is copied and stored on the matchbox or to the MAVRIC Cloud Virtual Matchbox. The user has options available to manage how long the particular file remains on their matchbox storage.
Is there a limit on how much data a Matchbox user can send per month ?
The MAVRIC Matchbox plug and desktop models utilize the owners existing broadband internet connection. Some Internet Service Providers limit the amount of data a particular account can use, but the Matchbox has no data restrictions
The MAVRIC Cloud virtual matchbox is a subscription based account utilizing the resources of Mavric Media. There will be a tiered subscription price that is derived from the amount of storage, and the amount of data throughput the user wants. Pricing has not been finalized, but we expect the subscription to be competitively priced with superior features to any other cloud subscription service.
Is there a limit to how many users I can have on my MAVRIC Matchbox?
The Matchbox plug and desktop models allow you to have up to 10 user accounts per device.
The MAVRIC Cloud virtual matchbox is limited to one user per subscription account at the launch of the service.
Can I send a file to someone who does not have a MatchBox?
 The short answer is Yes!, using our secure MavricCloud , file recipients can log in with a unique user ID and password , able to view only the file directly sent. 
The longer answer is still  Yes, although we have designed the Mavric MatchBox to send files from MatchBox to MatchBox or MAVRIC Cloud Virtual Matchbox.  Each Matchbox can add additional user accounts and send files between user accounts on an individual matchbox, with certain restrictions. 


Risks and challenges
POTENTIAL RISKS: The company does not fund it's campaign or raise adequate capital.
HOW WE'VE MITIGATED THESE RISKS: We have set our project funding goal so we can meet all commitments to deliver our solution and support it for a full year. The key members of the company have made major investments of time and their own money. We are fully committed to MAVRIC Media's success.
HOW WE'VE OVERCOME SIMILAR CHALLENGES IN THE PAST: We never Quit. We define the problem, we come up with unique solutions that others have not thought of, and we work the problems until we win !
SECONDARY ISSUES: ('cause we're just that thorough!) We are working with hardware manufacturers to ensure our desktop matchbox and mobile network modules receive certifications required to ship those products in the US and abroad. This could take 90-120 days.
WORST CASE SCENARIO: Since we have self funded this project, tested it extensively, we know we can deliver it. We don't forsee a scenario where we cannot meet our promises.
HOW WE ARE PREPARED TO RESOLVE POTENTIAL PROBLEMS: If you are not satisfied with our products or services, we will refund your pledge.",21.0,2,"1 Campaign

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Whether you are traveling pet owner, a first time pet owner or a young pet owner, Pettag+ is for you. </span>
</div><div><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">For a traveling or busy pet owners, Pettag+ gives you the peace of mind to know your pet has been cared for with a simple check of the app. This allows you to see that all the care your pet needs has been done by whoever you put your trust in to watch your pet. </span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
<p>For first time pet owners, Pettag+ helps with creating your pet's care goals for your specific breed and age of dog. Pettag+ helps create and remind you of basic care needs from 1 month to any age of pet. It will also provide training programs for things like potty training, chewing and fetch. Pettag+ focuses on positive training.</p>
<p>Young pet owners can have the greatest challenge of pet ownership. They need to both learn and be mature enough to care for a pet. Pettag+ helps with the care guides and training as noted above. But it also allows parents to easily check-in to ensure that there child is taking proper care of the pet.</p>
<p>Pettag+ also helps with issues like overfeeding. Never question did my wife/husband or child already feed the dog? Because once the dog is fed they can easily click the bone button to note this fact This will greatly reduce overeating and overfeeding of your pet. Plus reduce your pet's chance at obesity and improve the pet's overall health.</p>
<p>We spent a long time designing Pettag+ so it will be priced so everyone can have one. While many other devices use expensive Wifi and GPS with added monthly costs, we made our product to work with your Smartphone via Bluetooth. Because of this we can be much cheaper than our expensive competitors. We also designed Pettag+ so it does not need to be recharged. That means it never has to come off of the collar and you will not forget to recharge it! We will also replace your Pettag+ for free if it is in any way damaged by your pet. </p>

<div>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span>Pettag+ is made of ABS plastic and features fun buttons made of TPE. The device screws together with four small screws and is sealed with a waterproof gasket. Pettag+ buttons are backlit by LED light to confirm that the buttons were pressed and can be turned on for nighttime walks and play.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span>The device runs on a watch battery, with a battery life of approximately
 one year. Thanks to this battery power, Pettag+ never has to be taken 
off to be recharged.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span>Pettag+ is equipped with Bluetooth low energy 4.0 (BLE) technology with a
 range of 75 feet. It has an accelerator to track and store walks, 
exercise, and other adventures. All button inputs update to your smart 
device automatically. As long as the app is running in the background of
 your smartphone — and within range of the Pettag+ device — the app 
updates without needing to directly interact with your phone. (You can 
leave it in your pocket!)</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span>Each Pettag+ features an individual QR code on the back that is 
unique to your dog's profile. Once you enter your dog's info and add the
 tag information, the QR code will link to your dog's profile.<br/></span></p>

</div></div>","What is Pettag+

Pettag+ is a pet tag which allows the owner to interact and engage with the pet and is connected to a smartphone. Using Bluetooth, the device connects to an app on your smartphone to help you monitor your pets needs are being met.


We created Pettag+ for young pet owners, first-time pet owners, and busy pet owners. Pettag+ creates personalized training and care programs based on your pet’s breed, age, and weight. You simply press one of the buttons on the device and the Pettag+ device is updated. 
Pettag+ also allows you to connect with other pets in your life — those belonging to friends, family, or new folks you just met!
     



Sounds cool right?       Who needs Pettag+?                   You do!
Whether you are traveling pet owner, a first time pet owner or a young pet owner, Pettag+ is for you. 
For a traveling or busy pet owners, Pettag+ gives you the peace of mind to know your pet has been cared for with a simple check of the app. This allows you to see that all the care your pet needs has been done by whoever you put your trust in to watch your pet. 
For first time pet owners, Pettag+ helps with creating your pet's care goals for your specific breed and age of dog. Pettag+ helps create and remind you of basic care needs from 1 month to any age of pet. It will also provide training programs for things like potty training, chewing and fetch. Pettag+ focuses on positive training.
Young pet owners can have the greatest challenge of pet ownership. They need to both learn and be mature enough to care for a pet. Pettag+ helps with the care guides and training as noted above. But it also allows parents to easily check-in to ensure that there child is taking proper care of the pet.
Pettag+ also helps with issues like overfeeding. Never question did my wife/husband or child already feed the dog? Because once the dog is fed they can easily click the bone button to note this fact This will greatly reduce overeating and overfeeding of your pet. Plus reduce your pet's chance at obesity and improve the pet's overall health.
We spent a long time designing Pettag+ so it will be priced so everyone can have one. While many other devices use expensive Wifi and GPS with added monthly costs, we made our product to work with your Smartphone via Bluetooth. Because of this we can be much cheaper than our expensive competitors. We also designed Pettag+ so it does not need to be recharged. That means it never has to come off of the collar and you will not forget to recharge it! We will also replace your Pettag+ for free if it is in any way damaged by your pet. 





     
      How the Pettag+ Device 
  and App Work

    Create your pet’s profile: 

            Create care goals based on age, breed, and weight



        Then, simply press a button on the device to update the app. So long as the app is running in the background, you never have to remove your phone from your pocket!









Meet all of your pet’s daily goals!






    What else does Pettag+ Do?

  Connect with your friends and family and their dogs:






Pettag+ provides reminders for any daily or monthly medications with a basic push notification. Mark this to-do as done by using the HEART button.

Pettag+ has games and training programs built into the app that upon completion you will receive rewards like dog treats or toys.




                                 



    The Magic behind the
     Pettag+ Device


Pettag+ is made of ABS plastic and features fun buttons made of TPE. The device screws together with four small screws and is sealed with a waterproof gasket. Pettag+ buttons are backlit by LED light to confirm that the buttons were pressed and can be turned on for nighttime walks and play.
The device runs on a watch battery, with a battery life of approximately
 one year. Thanks to this battery power, Pettag+ never has to be taken 
off to be recharged.
Pettag+ is equipped with Bluetooth low energy 4.0 (BLE) technology with a
 range of 75 feet. It has an accelerator to track and store walks, 
exercise, and other adventures. All button inputs update to your smart 
device automatically. As long as the app is running in the background of
 your smartphone — and within range of the Pettag+ device — the app 
updates without needing to directly interact with your phone. (You can 
leave it in your pocket!)
Each Pettag+ features an individual QR code on the back that is 
unique to your dog's profile. Once you enter your dog's info and add the
 tag information, the QR code will link to your dog's profile.

     Why we need your help:

Let’s face it, molds are expensive. (Like new car expensive!) Developing a new technology, with new computer boards, is also a pretty pricey endeavor. (Like new fancy car expensive!) Plus, there’s the often forgotten costs of app development, patenting, materials, production, packaging, and marketing. We have self-funded the project to get to the present point of being ready to launch. Now it’s time to use those molds, make more of those boards, assemble, package, and get Pettag+ into your paws.
 Detail of cost breakdown: 
Molding Tech Development APP Development 
Production, packaging and marketing
Patents
The list goes on... 


Pettag+ gives back:
We will be giving 2% of all sales to animal shelters and donating devices.


Stretch Goals:One of our goals with this project is to sell discounted or donate these devices to animal rescues and shelters so they can be provided with all adopted pets. Many pets are returned within the first month because the owner has difficulty potty training them. We hope to be able to help teach people using our app and device and thus reduce the percentage of returned animals . 




                   What you get:




 
    When will I get my Pettag+:

We have worked very hard to build a product that we can deliver by 
December at the latest. We expect to ship in October. We have finished 
our board design and all the final engineering components for the device
 itself. The molders are in place and all we need to do is pull the 
trigger. The APP is almost finished and we have already started testing 
it. We will be testing full working prototypes within 2 weeks of this 
going live. 
Give us a BARK OUT!

To make this product successful we need your help. Please share this Indiegogo campaign with all your friends and family. We also understand that there are dog lovers out there that do not own a dog. Once the app is available you can download the app and follow all your friends and families pets.

Who we are:
We are passionate dog lovers who believe in creating a more engaging  experience for Pet owners.

<p>Cryptocurrencies need a wallet to store them. It should be always in hands, easy to use and safe from external attacks. Online wallets are vulnerable for hackers and don't have enough protection.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h3>
<p>1- Why manage my passwords with a card?<br/>The card is the easiest to have your information always at hand. Security is the same as we keep our credit cards in our wallet. Another advantage is not to show the passwords literally and much less to file them in online databases.</p>
<p>2-Is it worth to buy the IRYS CARD?<br/>Think: Would you like  a stranger access your bank account or use your profile on social networks? Use a strong password is the first step to protect the privacy of your information. This is the point where the Irys card shows its value with double authentication system.</p>
<p>3 - Is there no way to manage my passwords for free?<br/>There are password management APPs, where you register all your passwords in a single place and access with another master password. But:<br/>A) Is it safe to concentrate all of your visible passwords in one place? Besides being a potential target of cyber attacks , they can been accessed from anywhere in the world.<br/>B) Do you have confidence in your bank details, your online presence or your service history on a single free server?<br/>C) Although good alternatives, they are not immune to network failures.<br/>D) What if someone finds out your password? With Irys we will not even know any of your passwords.<br/>The Irys card not only protects and simplifies your life but integrates crescent community that knows it's that information is power.</p>
<p>4- I suspect that my account has been hacked and I need to change the password, do I have to buy another card?<br/>No. You do not need to buy another card, you just need to change your key trick that will have new passwords. But if you have dozens of registrations and do not want to change all, you can enforce only the essential services with a new string or wildcard code in back of the card.</p>
<p>5- My card was stolen, I lost all the passwords?<br/>We always recommend that you take a copy of your card as soon as that it arrives and store it in a safe place, this will be your emergency backup. To access your accounts, the thief would have to know what their records are, the email used and decrypt their passwords with their key trick, something quite unlikely for a simple pickpocket.</p>

FAQ
1- Why manage my passwords with a card?The card is the easiest to have your information always at hand. Security is the same as we keep our credit cards in our wallet. Another advantage is not to show the passwords literally and much less to file them in online databases.
2-Is it worth to buy the IRYS CARD?Think: Would you like  a stranger access your bank account or use your profile on social networks? Use a strong password is the first step to protect the privacy of your information. This is the point where the Irys card shows its value with double authentication system.
3 - Is there no way to manage my passwords for free?There are password management APPs, where you register all your passwords in a single place and access with another master password. But:A) Is it safe to concentrate all of your visible passwords in one place? Besides being a potential target of cyber attacks , they can been accessed from anywhere in the world.B) Do you have confidence in your bank details, your online presence or your service history on a single free server?C) Although good alternatives, they are not immune to network failures.D) What if someone finds out your password? With Irys we will not even know any of your passwords.The Irys card not only protects and simplifies your life but integrates crescent community that knows it's that information is power.
4- I suspect that my account has been hacked and I need to change the password, do I have to buy another card?No. You do not need to buy another card, you just need to change your key trick that will have new passwords. But if you have dozens of registrations and do not want to change all, you can enforce only the essential services with a new string or wildcard code in back of the card.
5- My card was stolen, I lost all the passwords?We always recommend that you take a copy of your card as soon as that it arrives and store it in a safe place, this will be your emergency backup. To access your accounts, the thief would have to know what their records are, the email used and decrypt their passwords with their key trick, something quite unlikely for a simple pickpocket.
 
Risks and Challenges

Delays in production can happen, but we are dedicated to making this project a success. The greatest risk for us involves transport.  But, I guarantee that you will receive your cards as soon as possible. My number one goal is to surprise you.

</div>
<div><b>With my Google calendar alone, can I use directly NFC chips?</b></div>
<div>Short answer: NO, chips work only via the AgentPoke platform</div>
<div>Long answer: The existing Google calendar widget by Google is great for sharing Free/Busy information on the web.

<div><b>Will I need to download a software?</b></div>
<div>No, you only need a web browser to manage your account. As for chips, they are automatically recognized by any NFC ready smartphone, no additional app is required. Pages open directly on the mobile's browser. </div>
<div><b>Do peoples can book appointment online via my website too?</b></div>
<div>Yes, by using the AgentPoke widget you can add the appointment scheduling feature to your existing website. You can also use the widget to automatically redirect mobile users from your website to your mobile web app built on AgentPoke.com</div>
<div><b>Will  I be able to change my tags landing page?</b></div>
<div>Yes, you can transparently redirect your NFC and QR code link to any URL.</div>

FAQ

With my Google calendar alone, can I use directly NFC chips?
Short answer: NO, chips work only via the AgentPoke platform
Long answer: The existing Google calendar widget by Google is great for sharing Free/Busy information on the web. However you cannot receive appointment booking unless your client 1) uses a digital calendar and 2) he/she added your Google calendar to his personal calendar and 3) he knows your Gmail address.
Will I need to download a software?
No, you only need a web browser to manage your account. As for chips, they are automatically recognized by any NFC ready smartphone, no additional app is required. Pages open directly on the mobile's browser. 
Do peoples can book appointment online via my website too?
Yes, by using the AgentPoke widget you can add the appointment scheduling feature to your existing website. You can also use the widget to automatically redirect mobile users from your website to your mobile web app built on AgentPoke.com
Will  I be able to change my tags landing page?
Yes, you can transparently redirect your NFC and QR code link to any URL.
Is there a subscription fee?
No, chips and other materials ordered via this campaign come with lifetime accounts on AgentPoke.com,
Is my phone ready for NFC?

We hope you’ll be excited by our proposal and will want to contribute towards its success and help guarantee the future of Bitcoin and Independent mining. We’re assuming that you already know a fair bit about Bitcoin mining, but if you don’t we’d suggest that you do some research before reading our proposal;  it will give you a better understanding of what it’s about and whether it’s right for you. You can find lots of explanations and other resources about Bitcoin on the internet. Good resources to start with are the Bitoin wiki  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin</a><font color=""black""> and the bitcointalk forum </font><a href=""http://bitcointalk.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://bitcointalk.org. </a><font color=""black"">If you have any questions that are not answer in our proposal, you can email us on:</font><font color=""black""><br/><br/><a href=""tech@novellotech.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tech@novellotech.com</a> for technical queries or<br/><a href=""sales@novellotech.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sales@novellotech.com</a> for purchases/perks or anything else<br/><br/>Indiegogo is our primary portal for our project, so at this time our website is still relatively underdeveloped.

<h3>                            The Timescales:</h3>
<br/>The Gantt chart below shows the critical paths of the project versus time - if you're not a technologist it might seem confusing, but it's here to sketch out what happens when. We plan to tape out our design sometime mid August 2014 and get our first packaged prototypes at the end of October. <br/>Pre production of system hardware will commence in September to minimise back end production delays.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/619687/files/20140602015607-Indiegogo_Image_Timescales.png?1401699367"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>We want to make it clear from the start that we have a different business model to our competitors; we want to be a volume supplier, but want most of  that volume to come from our initial customers in the form of repeat purchases. In return, they will get the best possible deals that we can give them, and access to exclusive mining power development programs.<br/><br/><br/><h3>                            The Financials:</h3>
<br/>We need to secure funding of approximately <i><b>$4.2 million</b></i> to achieve our goal, in return for contributions, our Perks are a range of mining solutions to suit all budgets ranging from only $59 (128 GigaHash/sec) to $2,799 (8 Terrahashes/sec) and even $30,000 for a fabulous 120 Terrahashes/sec! Target funding will enable us to ship all system pledges by the end of March 2015.<br/><br/>Why do we need so much? Well, building a custom silicon chip is very expensive – well over $1 million – and that only gets you a handful of prototypes, We, of course need tens of thousands of devices to build our contributors systems! To simply things, the pie chart below shows where all the money goes:<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/619689/files/20140602015647-Indiegogo_Pi.png?1401699407"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>In terms of what our products might mean for Contributors interested in mining we have a separate section later in the project proposal which specifically covers this.<br/><br/><b><i>If we get overfunded to approximately $11 million or more, we will implement our design in 28nm technology. This will give our contributors an extra 50% of hashing power in their systems!!</i><br/></b><br/>Make no mistake, this isn't an amateur project, and to deliver it will take a company with experienced, passionate and confident electronic professionals. That's where we come in:<br/><br/><br/><h3>                        About Novello:</h3>
<br/>Let’s tell you a bit about our company. Novello Technologies Limited is a UK Limited Company incorporated in Scotland. Our Company Registration Number is SC464008, and our VAT Registration Number is UK 186 6980 46. The driving force behind Novello Technologies is a group of professional engineers based in the UK with over 120 years combined experience in the design and manufacture of complex, highly reliable electronic systems and devices. We think that profitable Bitcoin mining should be accessible to anyone, no matter what their budget, and by ‘profitable’ we mean a device that will pay back its purchase price in less than 4 months. More accessibility means more users which will help strengthen the Bitcoin network and promote wider use of Bitcoins.<br/><br/>Our systems will be built using a modular approach and while most will have the capability to add more internal hashing capacity, all can be easily upgraded without having to buy a completely new system, preserving much of the value of your purchase. With our group experience in design, manufacturing, logistics and quality we know we can make truly consumer-grade products with unrivaled performance, cost effectiveness, reliability and after sales support, all within realistic timescales and budgets.<br/><br/>Thanks for reading this far, but you’ve still got a lot of information to read and digest; our proposal contains a lot of information which we think vital for potential Contributors to get the full picture about our plans and the financial/technological aspects of the project. We’ve included an FAQ section to address the most commonly asked questions, although specific queries can be emailed to us at: admin@novellotech.com. Please read on even if you’re not planning to contribute – we think you’ll find it interesting, and remember to tell your friends, family and co-workers about this great opportunity!<br/><br/><br/><h3>                 Delivery and Courier Charges:</h3>
<br/>Just one last word on the highlights, the prices of Perks do not include delivery. It's simply too difficult to try to set a 'standard' delivery for anywhere in the world so it has to be done on a country by country basis. We've given some indication below of what the MAXIMUM prices will be for selected locations and we hope to be able to offer even better deals before the delivery dates. If your destination isn't on the list then please contact us for a quotation.<br/><br/><p></p>

Perks will be delivered in the order they have been bought, regardless of type. Naturally, we will keep all our contributors updated on the project progression and delivery dates of their system. Please note that prices do not include import or local taxes – these will very much depend on where you live and you should check with your local tax authority. UK customer will have to pay VAT on prices of Perks, We will only use major International Courier companies with ‘Signed For’ and tracking services and will  get you the lowest possible costs. Here are some sample costs for major countries:<br/><p></p>
<br/>These rates are provisional, and we fully hope to be able to reduce them substantially before deliveries are due, especially for the NOVA-S units.<br/><br/>Please note that EEC customers will be charged UK VAT @ 20% unless they provide evidence of their VAT number and are genuine commercial entities.<br/><br/><br/>But now onto the Technical Section.

The Bitcoin Arms Race - You MUST read this</font></a></h4>
<font color=""black""><br/>Before we get into the project's technical details in depth, we want to address the subjects that all Bitcoin Miners dread – the Network Hashing Rate and Difficulty. From now on we’ll refer to this as the NTR - Network Terrahash Rate and DIF respectively. Despite what you might have been told, the two measures essentially track one another. You’ll never see mining rig vendors talking about these – if you sell pricey rigs it’s not good for sales.  We want to tackle this subject head on to give our potential contributors all the facts and figures they need – both good and bad - so they can make truly informed decisions about whether our project is right for them.<br/><br/>Since Bitcoin mining ASICs appeared, the NTR and DIF has risen over 500 fold and there is more to come. Growth is likely to continue due to the huge rise in Bitcoin’s value at the end of 2013, the amount of interest in the currency this has caused and increasingly the increase in the number of dedicated mining companies building huge facilities to mine. This has implications for any current or potential miners – how fast will the DIF rise, and will they ever be able to afford a rig powerful enough to be profitable? It’s a question made even more important by the prospect of a technological arms race with mining companies competing with each other to gain share of the NTR.<br/><br/>Individual miners will be the losers here, unless they can compete on equal terms, they can never make a profit. We aim to redress the balance, so it’s essential to have some idea of where the NTR/DIF might be for the next 18 months. That’s not an easy task as there are many variables including the Bitcoin/Dollar exchange rate and the pricing/availability of new mining rigs. Because it’s so important, we’ve spent a lot of time and effort trying to make estimates of what might happen, but they are estimates and are obviously not guaranteed! There are also braking factors that will slow growth if it’s too rapid and mining becomes uneconomical, and that point is reached when your rig can never make enough to pay for itself. So, here’s our estimate showing how we think the NTR might develop until the end of 2016:<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/619696/files/20140602020004-Indiegogo_Prediction_image.png?1401699604"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>Is there a simple way for a Miner to calculate if their rig is going to be profitable or not?  Well, we think there is. It’s based on how much you should pay for your rig in dollars per Gigahash:<br/><br/>-   on the date it’s delivered<br/>-   an exchange rate of 1 BTC = $500<br/>-   power usage of 0.85 /0.55 Joules/GH (or our worst case 0.3 Joules/GH             in red) at the AC wall socket<br/>-   power cost of US$ 0.1125 per kilowatt hour : US Domestic average according -   to EIA <a href=""http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/update/end_use.cfm#tabs_prices-3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/update/</a><br/><a href=""http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/update/end_use.cfm#tabs_prices-3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">    end_use.cfm#tabs_prices-3</a><br/>-   assumes that you want your rig to break even in a six month period after  <br/>    delivery – if it can’t do this, then there’s a very good chance that it may never <br/>    be viable. Try it out:<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/619699/files/20140602020043-Indiegogo__per_GH_500.png?1401699643"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/>You can clearly see the effect of the increasing NTR and energy usage on profitability. You can also see that for deliveries in Dec 14, our systems' $/ Gh/sec are substantially below the benchmark ones (@500 =  $0.82/GH  @450 = $0.73/GH)<br/><br/>If the exchange rate varies you will have to correct these figures by the appropriate ratio, and please<i> remember that the Bitcoin’s value might go down as well as up! </i>We are presenting this information not to scare people, but in the interests of full disclosure. Mining Bitcoins is very competitive and we don’t want our customers to imagine what ‘might be’ instead of accepting reality. But, it is possible to get an excellent return from mining if you have the right tools and the right supplier – and that’s where we come in.<br/><br/><a href=""#sect1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top</a>     <a href=""#index"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Back to Index</a><br/><br/><br/><h4><a name=""sect2"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""black"">2. Our Systems Lineup</font></a></h4>
<font color=""black""><br/>We have designed a family of mining devices targeted towards best possible performance per dollar. We recognise that not everyone can afford to spend thousands of dollars to gain entry to the Bitcoin mining club, so our flagship product isn’t a huge multi terrahash/sec miner (although we’ve got one of those too), it’s a little USB device costing $59 we call the NOVA – S that can be used with its’ supplied AC adapter and a host computer, preferably a laptop, to mine at 128GigaHash/sec. And it’s very well priced : <b><br/>$0.46 per Gigahash/second! </b><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/619703/files/20140602020254-Idiegogo_USB_Miner_Caption.png?1401699774"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/><b>This is a basic drawing of the USB Miner - NOT an actual product!</b><br/><br/>You can clearly see the main elements of the miner - two 35mm fans blow onto a Pin Fin heatsink, the body of the miner contains the mini hashing module and a power/control board. The back of the ASIC chip die is in direct contact with the underside of the heatsink.<br/><br/>The next product in our line is the NOVA - HH which builds on the NOVA – S concept. It isn’t a miner as such, it’s basically a powered 16 port USB hub which can accommodate up to 16 NOVA-S devices. It’s USB ports are very high power – up to 35 watts each. It includes a wifi enabled Raspberry Pi microcomputer which runs the mining software and acts as a bridge to the network, so no host system is needed. You do need a TV or monitor, keyboard and mouse to set it up initially, it’s an easy starter route for those who can’t afford to spend a lot of money in one go to buy one of the bigger rigs, but who can easily add capacity as they earn it! <br/><br/>Our system rigs offer hashing power from 1TH/sec up to 8 TH/sec and are based on a common enclosure platform with a form factor of 210W x 300L x 175H; pricing performance runs from $0.25 to $0.50 per GH/sec and if you order early you can get them even cheaper! The system rigs are all modular, so it’s very easy to add or change hashing modules whilst keeping your existing infrastructure. All our systems except the NOVA S USB miner have integrated wifi enabled Raspberry Pi micro computers, so do not need host systems to mine. If you look at our pricing structure and factor in the delivery date as December - February 2014, it is clear that we are offering our Contributors – especially those willing to commit early – a very considerable performance advantage in terms of how quickly they might achieve profitability on their new rig. Furthermore, our modular approach means that they can add or replace the hashing modules as newer ones become available and keep their rig competitive without having to buy a new one. Let’s talk about what makes our products tick:<br/><br/><a href=""#sect2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top      </a><a href=""#index"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to Index<br/><br/><br/></a><h3><a name=""sect3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""black"">3. Our Core Mining Chip</font></a></h3>
<font>Onto the good stuff now!Our ASIC has been designed to satisfy 3 key requirements:<br/><br/>-  High reliability and fault tolerance<br/>-  Maximum Hashing performance per $<br/>-  Minimum power consumption<br/><br/>The key to satisfying the second two requirements lies in our use of a Full Custom design. Why is this important?<br/><br/><br/></font><h4><b><a name=""sect31"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""black"">Full Custom versus Gate Based &amp; Standard Cell</font></a></b></h4>
<br/>If you want to make a silicon chip, there are several routes you can follow to do this. For speed, using a gate-based design is like digital Lego: it uses simple pre-designed blocks of transistors that can be joined together to quickly build your system. The blocks have known, tested performance and have been designed to work in most likely applications. They are used with complex EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software which makes the chip designers’ job a lot easier, especially when it comes to simulating the final chip’s performance and functionality, or so the theory goes. On the downside, gate based designs can be ‘top heavy’ in that they use far more or far bigger transistors in each gate than might be needed for a specific application, and that usually means higher power and more silicon real estate. However, the design path is fast, predictable (usually) and rugged. It’s a very good solution for most small to medium sized designs.<br/><br/>Next in line is Standard Cell. It’s broadly similar to gate based design except that larger pre-designed functions are available, such as counters and adders up to floating point units and complete processors, and a designer can use them in a similar ‘Lego like’ fashion to build their circuit, but with less flexible rules. It makes more efficient use of silicon real estate as the functions have been heavily optimised at the transistor level, but again they have to be generic enough to cover a wide range of applications in the real world. The design route is usually easier than gate based as the cells have more functionality and complex functions can be built more easily, though there may be issues with routing signals and timing. For the same function standard cells take up less silicon area than using gates. Usually EDA tools can accommodate both gate and cell based designs, or more usually mixtures of the two. Standard cell is very good for large, complex designs.<br/><br/>Finally there’s full custom. This is how chip design started off, manual designs with individual transistors and it’s still very much alive today. Why? Simple answer – efficiency, just like a custom kitchen or suit, you get exactly what you want and need, there’s no waste or extra unused functions. If you have a part in your circuit that has to drive only 2 standard loads, why put in one that’s twice as large that can drive 8? Or use a data register designed for 2 GHz operation that’s three times the size of one for 500MHz? Designing in only what you need can save a lot of transistors so the overall design is much more efficient. Trouble is, it takes a lot more manual involvement from the designer and there are few EDA tools to help, so it costs a lot more. But take heart from the fact that big companies like Intel and AMD have hundreds of engineers designing and building full custom designs every day - just like we'll hopefully be doing soon!<br/><br/></font><a href=""#sect3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top      </a><a href=""#index"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">.Back to Index<br/><br/><br/></a><h4><a name=""sect32"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""black"">Fault Tolerance and Reliability</font></a></h4>
<font color=""black""><br/>Our device will be built around an array of 256 dual-SHA256 pipelines (2 x 65 stages in each) which operate as a group. An additional 16 pipelines are also present, but are not mapped into the address space of the main array. Chip performance is 128 Gigahashes/second (GH/s) at rated clock speed of 500Mhz, rated core voltage of 0.8V, die core temperature of 75 degrees Celcius and power consumption of 25 Watts. It is possible to run at a lower core voltage of 0.6V, however until we have working silicon we cannot confirm exact performance at this voltage.<br/><br/>Please note that power consumption figures in the paragraph above are for the chip only, and do not include power supply and auxiliary circuit losses. Comprehensive test structures built into the fabric of the device allow for production testing and ‘manufacturability’ analysis. It also enables the HM’s 32 bit microcontroller to carry out automatic full function tests on all pipelines, including the spares. This means that full hashing power is always available as pipelines are constantly ‘rotated’ for testing. Testing takes only takes  a few seconds and  allows the controller to identify any that are faulty;  if one is found, it is temporarily disabled and a ‘spare’ mapped into its address space. A failure may be a temporary fault due to a hotspot, but regular testing will identify if the fault is a genuine failure or intermittent. The pipeline can then be permanently disabled and ‘remembered’ by the system controller as faulty, with a spare taking its place. This all takes place without any user intervention, although test results and pipeline swaps are recorded and can be reviewed at any time.<br/><br/><a href=""#sect3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top     </a><a href=""#index"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Back to Index<br/><br/><br/></a></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><h4><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><a name=""sect33"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""black"">Small is beautiful – sometimes</font></a></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></h4>

Larger chips produce more heat, smaller ones only produce a little but there’s more of them. A larger chip uses a smaller PCB than lots of smaller ones, and there’s fewer connections to the board to go faulty. But a larger chip has a much lower production yield than a much smaller one due to the increased chances of encountering a defect in the silicon wafer used to build it, which means it’s more expensive per GH/sec.<br/><br/>What we’re pointing out here is that there’s a balancing act between functionality and cost and it’s interesting to see how other companies have done their designs: some are very small, others very large. We’ve taken the decision to optimise and go right down the middle, so our chip comes in at about 100mm2. This is a manageable size, and still yields reasonably well, its packaged in a Moulded Flip Chip Ball Grid Array package (a bit of a mouthful that so it’s more commonly called MFCBGA) to make the thermal design of our systems efficient, but we’ll come to that later. With a single chip rated at 128GH/sec, Terrahash capability can be easily obtained by using 8 of them. Our design actually use 4 chips in a module, but this will be covered in the section 4. <br/><br/></font><a href=""#sect3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top      </a><a href=""#index"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to Index<br/><br/><br/></a><h4><a name=""sect34"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""black"">Heat Kills (chips)</font></a></h4>
<br/>We plan to build the ASIC in a 40nm LP medium Vt process, this is a stable and reliable process, very cost effective and relatively low power; you’ll see below that our systems give excellent Watt/GH performance. SHA256 is very power hungry, virtually every transistor in a pipeline switches every clock cycle, so the key to performance is reducing the number of transistors that switch and minimising the power consumption of those that do.  We've implemented the pipeline stages within the SHA256 engine at full custom level as we discussed earlier, it means we can save a huge number of transistors and control the size and hence power consumption of those that remain. We’re also making extensive use of analogue design techniques to minimise noise and reduce supply voltage – again saving power. Every transistor we save, shrink or optimise saves power, and overall this results in greater power efficiency.<br/>It’s all very well having high-tech chips that can mine fast, but they also produce a lot of heat. If the chips can’t get rid of the heat they generate quickly enough, their core temperature rockets and this destroys their transistors, so it’s essential to have good thermal management to make sure this doesn’t happen. Rig suppliers have adopted several different ways to accomplish this, usually by a classic fan/heatsink arrangement or water cooling. We looked at both these and other methods, and decided that for maximum reliability we’d go down a fairly conservative route and so use ducted forged pin fin heatsinks with high capacity fans blowing them.<br/><br/>This is a good combination and means we can get rid of sufficient heat to keep the chips well within their operating temperature range. It’s also very reliable – it’s easy for the fan controller to determine if a fan has stuck or fused and so close the system down until it’s fixed. We are using continuous duty fans with fluid or ball bearings with expected lifetimes (called MTBF’s – Mean Time Before Failure) of over 100,000 hours. Also, pin fin technology means the sinks are fairly compact, enabling us to pack a lot of hashing capacity into a compact enclosure. A blown pin fin heatsink is also used for the NOVA-S USB miner with very small fans mounted on top of the heatsink, this gives excellent cooling results, even in a hot room.<br/><h4><br/></h4></font><a href=""#sect3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top      </a><a href=""#index"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to Index<br/><br/></a><a name=""sect35"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""black""><br/></font></a></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><h4><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><font color=""black""><a name=""sect35"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""black"">Power Play</font></a></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></h4>

If you’re an ‘average’ US customer with a current 0.85J/GH rig paying the average rate for your electricity, then this will happen when the NTR hits about 320,000. If you manage to get your hands on a 0.55J/GH rig then the 50/50 point is delayed until 475,000. With a 0.3J/GH rig such as ours it’s nearer 1,050,0000! We’ve designed our systems to consume as little power as possible whilst remaining competitive at hashing; the benefit of using full custom design is that you only use what you need – no wasted resources. Below are our estimates for MAXIMUM power consumption for our systems with all devices running at rated speed, measured at the AC wall socket so including all power supply switching losses and auxiliary circuit power:<br/><br/>NOVA-S                 38 watts, 0.30 Joules/GH  (not including host)<br/>NOVA-HH              50 watts, 0.40 Joules/GH  With 1 x NOVA - S   <br/>                                 580 watts, 0.29 Joules/GH  With 16 x NOVA - S<br/>NOVA-1 (1 TH/s)  300 watts, 0.30 Joules/GH<br/>NOVA-2 (2 TH/s)  580 watts, 0.29 Joules/GH<br/>NOVA-4 (4 TH/s)  1100 watts,  0.28 Joules/GH<br/>NOVA-8 (8 TH/s)  2150 watts  0.27 Joules/GH<br/><br/>You can see these are very competitive figures, despite us using 40nm technology. And they’ll get even better with our generation 2 40nm chip – some 36% less, we estimate.<br/><br/></font><a href=""#sect3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top      </a><a href=""#index"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to Index<br/><br/><br/></a><h3><a name=""sect4"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""black"">4.

<br/>Bitcoin mining is a very dynamic industry by nature, things keep changing and the ever rising difficulty means that today’s top of the line mining rig is very soon obsolete, it’s a bit like what happens in the PC industry, except that an old Pentium 4 computer can still perform very useful work, whereas an old mining rig just consumes electricity! The PC industry taught us that a modular approach to systems means that they can be upgraded simply by swapping outdated or inefficient parts, such as DRAM or graphics cards. Yes, you can only do this so often but a lot of the original value of your system can be preserved, and that’s why we’ve chosen a similar route with our miners.<br/><br/>It’s a common misconception that most of the cost of a mining rig is in the asic chips. Certainly to engineer, tool and build an ASIC takes millions of dollars, but the actual parts don’t costs that much, in our systems the chips typically account for about 50% of the overall production cost. The rest of the system isn’t necessarily dependent on what’s inside the chips, so careful design can mean that it can be used and reused, much in the same way as a PC chassis. As mining difficulty increases, so miners need more power, either in the form of additions to their rig, or more usually a new setup.<br/><br/>We have structured our system design such that it uses multiple modules which can be easily replaced, and our overall design aim is to preserve the value of the system infrastructure for as long as possible. In particular, the system internal power supplies are oversized and the DC-DC converters for chip power have a wide voltage and current operating range meaning they can cope with newer chip technologies. This will help keep our customer competitive – rather than having to buy a whole new rig, they can extend their current one or change the hashing modules for newer technology ones. We’d like to think that other manufacturers might mimic our scheme and produce third party products to fit in our infrastructure.<br/><br/></font><a href=""#sect4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top  </a><a href=""#index"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to Index<br/><br/><br/></a><h4><a name=""sect42"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""black"">Module Mania</font></a></h4>
<br/>In this section we’ll explore the modules we’ll use, and how they fit into the system. We have five main modules:<br/><br/>A <i><b>Hashing Module (HM)</b></i> that contains 4 mining chips, a 32 bit microcontroller, USB interface and some support circuitry; very easy to install and/or replace. Self – testing without system controller intervention.<br/><br/>A <i><b>Micro Hashing Module (MHM)</b></i> that is essentially a smaller HM with only 1 mining chip, it has the same 32 bit microcontroller, USB interface and support circuits and is used in the NOVA – S USB miner.<br/><br/>A<i><b> Controller Board (CB) </b></i>that consists of multiple USB hubs, fan control circuitry and auxiliary power regulators. It’s also used in the NOVA HH powered hub.<br/><br/>A <i><b>High Current Power Supply (HCPS) </b></i>– 1 for each HM – that incorporates a 200 amp capable variable voltage regulator used to supply power to the HM chips. HCPS modules take in regulated 12V DC power supplied from an internal PSU – there is no need to buy a separate power supply - and sit ‘piggyback’ on top of an HM, a low resistance plug and socket arrangement is used to connect the two together. The HCPS automatically senses the HM type and adjusts its’ output to suit. This means it can be used with future HM’s which will most likely require lower voltage, but more current.<br/><br/>HM’s and HCPS’s are both based on a 60 x 96 mm pcb platform.<br/><br/>The NOVA – S USB miner also has an HCPS device <i><b>UPCU – USB Power Control Unit</b></i>, but it’s integrated with a fan controller and is designed to take power from an external AC adapter which comes with the miner. Please note that full performance at 128GH/sec is only available when using the supplied AC adapter due to the current limitation of standard USB ports; using maximum available USB 2.0 current alone will give limit performance to around 8 - 10GH/sec, USB 3.0 will allow approximately 20GH/sec.<br/><br/>A fifth module, a Raspberry Pi single board computer with  Wi-Fi capability is used as a 'bridge' between the miner and the Bitcoin Network, it also allows system monitoring and configuration when connected to an external TV (or monitor), keyboard and mouse. The Pi will run a customised version of the excellent Minepeon software. With all of our systems except the NOVA-S, you don't need an external host computer to mine.<br/><br/><a href=""#sect4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top     </a><a href=""index"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Back to Index<br/><br/><br/></a><h3><a name=""sect5"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""black"">5. How big is your Rig?</font></a></h3>
<br/>Now we’ve got all this technology, we need to put it in a box to keep everything tidy. We’ve designed a ‘standard’ enclosure which measures 210mm W x 175mm H x 300mm L, and it can accommodate up to 8 HM’s, ie 4TH.  The NOVA 8 miner uses two standard modules coupled together. A standard enclosure can accommodate 2 800W High Efficiency power supplies, 1 for each 2TH of capacity. We’ve done this to maximise system reliability and to aid those of you unfortunate enough to have to rely on 110V AC supplies! The power supplies sit in the lower portion of the rig, the Raspberry Pi and the USB hubs are contained in the mid portion and the actual HM’s and HCPS’s in the top, together with the pin fin heatsink.<br/><br/></font><a href=""#sect5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top      </a><a href=""#index"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to Index<br/><br/><br/></a><h3><a name=""sect6"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""black"">6. So what can my Rig do for Me?</font></a></h3>
<br/>Have you ever seen a mining rig supplier exploring this subject in their sale pitch? No? Ever wondered why? It’s really simple – too much information given to buyers might put them off purchasing. Rig manufacturers know that most Bitcoin miners dream of making millions of dollars from their mining activities, and it’s much better to let them hold onto that dream; a dose of reality might stop them buying. Well, we’re engineers and don’t believe in fantasy, just facts, so please read the following three points very carefully:<br/><br/>Fact 1:  Bitcoin mining isn’t an investment – it’s a gamble, albeit one with semi predictable odds<br/><br/>Fact 2: Even an 8TH rig isn’t going to make you a fortune, unless there’s a dramatic rise in BTC value<br/><br/>Fact 3: You can get a very reasonable return from mining – potentially better than most conventional investment vehicles – if you have the right information, right equipment and the right supplier.<br/><br/>So now that we’ve made you aware of the pitfalls, let’s look at what you might be able to achieve:<br/><br/>From Jan 2014 to Jan 2015 (365 days), based on our NTR / DIF prediction and 1BTC = $500, we estimate a NOVA-1 1 TH/sec rig, taking into account costs of electricity and mining pool fees could earn you:<br/><br/>$1322 based on average current US residential power costs (estimated at 12cents per kWh in 2015) or<br/><br/>$1037 based on corresponding UK figures (estimated at 23 cents per kWh in 2015)<br/><br/>On a purchase price of $499 and shipping/tax charges of $110, then a US rig will provide net earnings of ($1322 - $499 - $110) = $713, or ROI (Return On Investment) of 143%, less taxes you may have to pay on your income, but you still have the value of the hardware and it will continue to earn money. We don’t have detailed figures up to the end of 2016, but predict the net earnings would be $602 for the US, $350 for the UK (with power costs rising by an estimated  5%).<br/><br/>At the other end of the scale, a US based NOVA-8 systems’ 2015 figure is $10,576 deducting initial costs, shipping and taxes gives net earnings of (10,576- $2799 - $160) = $7,617, or ROI of 272%. (For the UK the figures are $8,296 - $2799 - $600, ie $4897 or ROI of 175%). Both figures are again less any payable personal or corporate taxes. Why the large difference? It’s all down mainly to those power costs (and UK VAT). Of course this analysis is only looking at payment over a long period of time, mining rewards are paid out regularly if you’re using a pool as most miners are, this then gives you the opportunity to buy more hashing power as you get more funds. In case you missed it, that was a sneaky introduction for our Guaranteed Supply Program or GSP, it’s another part of our product offering which will continue to give our customers a financial advantage once they have started mining with our products<br/><br/><a href=""#sect6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top      </a><a href=""#index"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to Index<br/><br/><br/></a><h3><a name=""sect7"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""black"">7. Guaranteed Supply Program and 'Jane'</font></a></h3>
<br/>OK, you’ve got your new mining rig and it’s happily earning its keep. You’ve got some Bitcoins (or cash), and would like more Hashing power NOW. Trouble is, all the competitive products have waiting lists of months. Sound familiar? We are offering some of our early Indiegogo contributors a unique program where we will guarantee them almost immediate delivery on up to an additional 3 times the original hashing power they purchased, PLUS discounted rates on the upgrade hardware! This applies only if they are Fortune 500 customers or the first 500 who purchased a 49’er in each of the main rig categories, it doesn’t include the NOVA-S or NOVA HH product.<br/><br/>There will be a 3 month period after their delivery date where this kicks in, after that they can order up to 3 times their original hashing power as hashing modules or full systems at the rate of one upgrade of 1 x per month up to one year from their original delivery date. Of course, they can order as much hashing power as they like at any time, but delivery will depend on order backlog and available capacity; they would still get a discount but not as much as they would get buying via GSP. Here’s an example of how the GSP might work in the real world.<br/><br/>The spreadsheet below shows a running mining earnings balance for Jane, who lives in Colorado. She’s one of the first to order a NOVA-1 1TH system and it’s delivered on January 4 2015. As time goes on her rig earns Bitcoins which she converts to cash. When she has enough money, she uses her GSP status and buys 1TH upgrades at $249 each – she’s already paid for the electricity to run her rig costing 12 cents per kWh, the US average in 2015. She gets her modules within 10 days of ordering, and soon she’s hashing with more power, making more money for the rest of the month. And so this process repeats until Jane has used up her GSP credits.<br/><br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/619926/files/20140602041919-Indiegogo_Image_Jane_500.png?1401707959"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>By Jan 4 2016 Jane’s now 4 TH rig has generated her net $2,721, and that’s including paying for upgrades and the electricity to run it. That’s not bad for a $499 initial purchase! Over the following 12 months it will make her a further net $2,408 even allowing for energy bills going up by 5%. She’s not getting rich by any stretch of the imagination, but we imagine she’d be more than happy that she signed up early to buy her rig. Now, if Jane lived in California or other areas with high energy costs, she might be paying twice (or more) the US average electricity costs; this will have a significant effect on her earnings, but what can a miner situated in a high energy cost region do? Well, we may have a solution to that problem for our early customers, but it depends on to what level we get funded as it relies on a lot of investment in infrastructure.<br/><br/><br/><br/><i><b>We again have to point out that the financial predictions shown above depend on a lot of factors, most of which cannot be predicted to any degree of precision and they are given for illustration purposes ONLY.

<font color=""black""><br/><font color=""red"">Q. This all sounds far too good to be true. How can you possibly build systems at this price when others are charging 3 or more times as much for the same hashing power?</font><br/><br/>A. We expect that this a question most people will ask. There are 3 separate parts to the answer:<br/><br/>Firstly, we have a lot of experience in the design and manufacture of consumer electronic systems, so we know how to design and build at the lowest possible cost. We’re using well-established methods to source competitive, competent suppliers and subcontractors who will manufacture the component parts of the systems so all we’re doing is final assembly and test.<br/><br/>Secondly, by using full custom 40nm technology we save over $1.3M in development costs versus 28nm- that’s $130 a unit for 10k units in engineering charges alone. Device gate density doesn’t count in SHA256 – it’s the number of transistors switching per clock, their power consumption and power dissipation capability of the die that limits performance, so our full custom design approach means our 40nm device can easily outperform a gate or standard cell based 28nm design.<br/><br/>Don’t believe us? Read the excellent book by David Chinnery &amp; Kurt Keuzer:<br/><br/>""<i>Closing the Power Gap between ASIC and Custom; Tools and Techniques for Low Power Design</i>"" (Springer); ISBN-13: 978-0387257631 <br/><br/>Lastly, and most importantly, our whole business ethos is built upon maintaining a level playing field for our customers in mining and that means we have to be a volume supplier. Volume means savings in parts cost, (aided by modularity) and lower cost to the customer. It also means we’re content to make a modest margin, not what we think the market will ‘bear’. If we can build and sell an 8TH system for $2799 - including its share of the development and tooling costs – and make a decent profit then so can every other supplier. Ask yourself why their prices are so high. <br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/><br/></a><font color=""red"">Q. You mention mining companies a few times – why do you see them as such a problem?<br/><br/><font color=""black"">A. Bitcoin was always meant to be free of any centralised control, that means that everyone can participate, and this should apply to mining also. If you have too much power concentrated in the hands of a few individuals or organisations it can severely disadvantage others. As newer, more expensive technologies come on - line, mining will end up being the sole preserve of the wealthy or dedicated companies, especially those who can afford to develop their own ASICs – and some have clearly already done so. Then what happens to ordinary miners? They can never get hold of hardware at the same $/GH figures the mining companies enjoy– unless they come to us. </font></font><font color=""red""><font color=""black""><br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/></a><br/><font color=""red"">Q. You’re a UK company, so why do you want to be paid in US dollars?<br/><br/><font color=""black"">A. Over 90% of our costs are in dollars, so it makes more sense for us to get paid in them.</font></font><br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><font color=""red""><font color=""black""> </font></font></a><font color=""red""><font color=""black""><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/></a><br/><font color=""red"">Q. Why don't you take Paypal?<br/><font color=""black"">A. It's simply not a suitable solution for this type of program. We can't plan development of complex systems when some contributors - or malevolent competitors - may decide to cancel their contribution within 90 days. That potentially messes up the project for everyone else that's contributed.</font></font><br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/><br/></a><font color=""red"">Q. Is there a limit as to how many systems I can buy?<br/><br/><font color=""black"">A. Within reason, no. Indiegogo has limits on how much you can contribute in one transaction, please go to </font></font><font color=""red""><font color=""black""><a href=""http://support.indiegogo.com/entries/20494567-how-to-contribute-to-a-campaign"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://support.indiegogo.com/entries/20494567-how-to-contribute-to-a-campaign</a> for more information on this. Essentially you pay on purchase so if you try to buy 10k$ worth you’ll need that on your card. <br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/></a><br/><font color=""red"">Q. Can’t you deliver the systems quicker? The longer delivery takes, the less I make!<br/><br/><font color=""black"">A. That’s not possible. We don’t give over-optimistic, unachievable timescales. But if you’re willing to wait, you’ll get the best possible return per dollar, your system will remain competitive for some time to come and you can easily upgrade it with newer technology without having to replace it completely.</font><br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/></a><br/><font color=""red"">Q. Why aren’t you using 28nm technology like everyone else?<br/><br/><font color=""black"">A. For this project, 40nm is very cost efficient. Our design is very compact and efficient and so can compete with current 28nm (and even 20nm) offerings. We want to keep costs low for our customers and that’s exactly what’s been achieved – unbeatable $/GH values. What’s the gain for our customers if we using a more advanced and costly technology?<br/><br/>However, if we get significantly overfunded to a minimum of $11.5 million then we’ll consider using the extra profit we’ll make to fund development of a 28nm chip instead of our original 40nm design, (although we’re pretty confident that the rev 2 40nm chip will give just as good financial results). A 28nm design would contain twice as many pipelines on the same die size, but run at a lower clock frequency of 366 MHz, giving a hashing speed per chip of  192GH/sec, ie a speed increase of 50%, meaning that a NOVA-1 miner would run at 1.5TH/sec at the same power consumption as the 40nm solution!</font></font><br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/></a><br/><font color=""red"">Q. Will you be making other Bitcoin related products in the future?<br/><br/><font color=""black"">A. Definitely. For a start, we plan to introduce the Generation 2 HMs in early 2015 to give our existing customers an upgrade path which will prolong their competitive advantage. We will be implementing some alternative low power structures in the initial chips, and the results from these will shape the exact design of the next generation chips.</font></font><br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/></a><br/><font color=""red"">Q. I like the modular approach and upgrade path, but at this time I’m one of the people you mentioned that has limited funds, so can only afford the basic system. Can I upgrade it before the delivery date, and how much would it cost?<br/><br/><font color=""black"">A. The short answer is a qualified ‘yes’, but please bear in mind that we have to be fair to everyone in the queue. If systems were available you would have to go to the back of the delivery queue, otherwise we would have lots of people ordering the 1 TH system then asking to upgrade it to a 8TH one before delivery, and that’s unfair.</font></font><br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/></a><br/><font color=""red"">Q. Will Novello be mining Bitcoins as well as making Rigs?<br/><br/><font color=""black"">A. That’s clearly a case of conflict of interest, so no. Who on earth would want to buy from a company that’s a direct competitor? Worse still, how could any normal company with any ethics expect their customers to accept such behaviour?</font><br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/></a><br/><font color=""red"">Q. What’s in it for you by offering GSP?<br/><br/><font color=""black"">A. We have a different business model in that we want to keep our customers profitable and buying more TH from us and will give them major incentives to do so – they can keep competitive no matter what happens to the NTR and DIF. In GSP we give them availability of new hashing capacity when it’s most needed – there’s no catch, just a new way of looking at the supplier/miner partnership.</font></font><br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/></a><br/><font color=""red"">Q. Are you going to sell the chips separately?<br/><br/><font color=""black"">A. Yes, we’d very much like to do this and to encourage people within the Bitcoin community to experiment with our ASIC and make their own rigs. The ASICs are able to run at higher clock speeds and we are keen to gather data from users on how far they can be pushed. But first we have to be satisfied that we can supply a device with the same standards of support and documentation as a commercial one. This won’t be possible until about January 2015, by which time we hope to have appointed a distributor – ideally from within the Bitcoin community – to coordinate sale and support. As for third party system builders, we can’t really see how they could compete against our product pricing as they have to buy chips from us, but that’s not saying that we wouldn’t do it if there is enough interest.</font></font><br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/></a><br/><font color=""red"">Q. How accurate are the power estimates?<br/><br/><font color=""black"">A. We have extensive experience with this technology, and our figures are based on existing structures that are already in production, so our figures are accurate to about +/-10%.</font></font><br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/></a><br/><font color=""red"">Q. I like the self-repair function, but I’d rather have the extra pipelines to use for hashing. Is this possible and can the ASIC devices be overclocked?<br/><br/><font color=""black"">A. The short answer to the first part is no. As regards the second part, the ASICs are capable of running at higher speeds, but then the power dissipation goes up and so does the die junction temperature. At this stage we’d rather that customers accept the system specifications as they are; once we complete system integration and testing, it may be that the power consumption is lower than our worst case predictions and so clock speeds can be increased. We’ll keep all customers advised on this as testing progresses.</font></font><br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/></a><br/><font color=""red"">Q. Are you sure your NTR/DIF figures are accurate? Some people on the web say they’ll be a lot higher!<br/><br/><font color=""black"">A. Realistically, the NTR and DIF can only rise so fast due to a number of reasons, mainly that as they rise, earnings fall, and that deters purchases of new hashing capacity. The mining companies are mostly banked by Venture Capital investors, and they’ll not put money into ventures that can’t give them a set return in a reasonably short period. We don’t have a crystal ball, but we do have our own modelling program that simulates what we think happens in the real life Bitcoin market. Of course, it’s not 100% accurate, but it can track rig buying behaviour reasonably well, so we’re sure the figures will stand up to scrutiny.</font></font><br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/></a><br/><font color=""red"">Q. What’s the system’s warranty?<br/><br/><font color=""black"">A. As standard, a 2 year Return to Base. We’ll be operating an RMA (Return Material Authorisation) process so that if a customer encounters a problem, they go through a ‘diagnostic’ procedure to make sure the fault is real. This saves time and money. Return postage costs will be paid by Novello, providing that the system warranty has not been voided in any way, and that the fault is genuine.</font></font><font color=""red""><font color=""black""><br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Top<br/></a><br/></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></div>","Novello Technologies Limited would like to present our project proposal for design and development of a family of Bitcoin mining rigs.

                            The Timescales:
The Gantt chart below shows the critical paths of the project versus time - if you're not a technologist it might seem confusing, but it's here to sketch out what happens when. We plan to tape out our design sometime mid August 2014 and get our first packaged prototypes at the end of October. Pre production of system hardware will commence in September to minimise back end production delays.
We want to make it clear from the start that we have a different business model to our competitors; we want to be a volume supplier, but want most of  that volume to come from our initial customers in the form of repeat purchases. In return, they will get the best possible deals that we can give them, and access to exclusive mining power development programs.                            The Financials:
We need to secure funding of approximately $4.2 million to achieve our goal, in return for contributions, our Perks are a range of mining solutions to suit all budgets ranging from only $59 (128 GigaHash/sec) to $2,799 (8 Terrahashes/sec) and even $30,000 for a fabulous 120 Terrahashes/sec! Target funding will enable us to ship all system pledges by the end of March 2015.Why do we need so much? Well, building a custom silicon chip is very expensive – well over $1 million – and that only gets you a handful of prototypes, We, of course need tens of thousands of devices to build our contributors systems! To simply things, the pie chart below shows where all the money goes:
In terms of what our products might mean for Contributors interested in mining we have a separate section later in the project proposal which specifically covers this.If we get overfunded to approximately $11 million or more, we will implement our design in 28nm technology. This will give our contributors an extra 50% of hashing power in their systems!!Make no mistake, this isn't an amateur project, and to deliver it will take a company with experienced, passionate and confident electronic professionals. That's where we come in:                        About Novello:
Let’s tell you a bit about our company. Novello Technologies Limited is a UK Limited Company incorporated in Scotland. Our Company Registration Number is SC464008, and our VAT Registration Number is UK 186 6980 46. The driving force behind Novello Technologies is a group of professional engineers based in the UK with over 120 years combined experience in the design and manufacture of complex, highly reliable electronic systems and devices. We think that profitable Bitcoin mining should be accessible to anyone, no matter what their budget, and by ‘profitable’ we mean a device that will pay back its purchase price in less than 4 months. More accessibility means more users which will help strengthen the Bitcoin network and promote wider use of Bitcoins.Our systems will be built using a modular approach and while most will have the capability to add more internal hashing capacity, all can be easily upgraded without having to buy a completely new system, preserving much of the value of your purchase. With our group experience in design, manufacturing, logistics and quality we know we can make truly consumer-grade products with unrivaled performance, cost effectiveness, reliability and after sales support, all within realistic timescales and budgets.Thanks for reading this far, but you’ve still got a lot of information to read and digest; our proposal contains a lot of information which we think vital for potential Contributors to get the full picture about our plans and the financial/technological aspects of the project. We’ve included an FAQ section to address the most commonly asked questions, although specific queries can be emailed to us at: admin@novellotech.com. Please read on even if you’re not planning to contribute – we think you’ll find it interesting, and remember to tell your friends, family and co-workers about this great opportunity!                 Delivery and Courier Charges:
Just one last word on the highlights, the prices of Perks do not include delivery. It's simply too difficult to try to set a 'standard' delivery for anywhere in the world so it has to be done on a country by country basis. We've given some indication below of what the MAXIMUM prices will be for selected locations and we hope to be able to offer even better deals before the delivery dates. If your destination isn't on the list then please contact us for a quotation.
We plan to start deliveries around the end of December 2014 and complete by the end of March 2015. Perks will be delivered in the order they have been bought, regardless of type. Naturally, we will keep all our contributors updated on the project progression and delivery dates of their system. Please note that prices do not include import or local taxes – these will very much depend on where you live and you should check with your local tax authority. UK customer will have to pay VAT on prices of Perks, We will only use major International Courier companies with ‘Signed For’ and tracking services and will  get you the lowest possible costs. Here are some sample costs for major countries:
These rates are provisional, and we fully hope to be able to reduce them substantially before deliveries are due, especially for the NOVA-S units.Please note that EEC customers will be charged UK VAT @ 20% unless they provide evidence of their VAT number and are genuine commercial entities.But now onto the Technical Section.

The Bitcoin Arms Race - You MUST read this
Before we get into the project's technical details in depth, we want to address the subjects that all Bitcoin Miners dread – the Network Hashing Rate and Difficulty. From now on we’ll refer to this as the NTR - Network Terrahash Rate and DIF respectively. Despite what you might have been told, the two measures essentially track one another. You’ll never see mining rig vendors talking about these – if you sell pricey rigs it’s not good for sales.  We want to tackle this subject head on to give our potential contributors all the facts and figures they need – both good and bad - so they can make truly informed decisions about whether our project is right for them.Since Bitcoin mining ASICs appeared, the NTR and DIF has risen over 500 fold and there is more to come. Growth is likely to continue due to the huge rise in Bitcoin’s value at the end of 2013, the amount of interest in the currency this has caused and increasingly the increase in the number of dedicated mining companies building huge facilities to mine. This has implications for any current or potential miners – how fast will the DIF rise, and will they ever be able to afford a rig powerful enough to be profitable? It’s a question made even more important by the prospect of a technological arms race with mining companies competing with each other to gain share of the NTR.Individual miners will be the losers here, unless they can compete on equal terms, they can never make a profit. We aim to redress the balance, so it’s essential to have some idea of where the NTR/DIF might be for the next 18 months. That’s not an easy task as there are many variables including the Bitcoin/Dollar exchange rate and the pricing/availability of new mining rigs. Because it’s so important, we’ve spent a lot of time and effort trying to make estimates of what might happen, but they are estimates and are obviously not guaranteed! There are also braking factors that will slow growth if it’s too rapid and mining becomes uneconomical, and that point is reached when your rig can never make enough to pay for itself. So, here’s our estimate showing how we think the NTR might develop until the end of 2016:
Is there a simple way for a Miner to calculate if their rig is going to be profitable or not?  Well, we think there is. It’s based on how much you should pay for your rig in dollars per Gigahash:-   on the date it’s delivered-   an exchange rate of 1 BTC = $500-   power usage of 0.85 /0.55 Joules/GH (or our worst case 0.3 Joules/GH             in red) at the AC wall socket-   power cost of US$ 0.1125 per kilowatt hour : US Domestic average according -   to EIA http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/update/    end_use.cfm#tabs_prices-3-   assumes that you want your rig to break even in a six month period after      delivery – if it can’t do this, then there’s a very good chance that it may never     be viable. Try it out:
We've also shown what happens if Bitcoin falls back to $450:
You can clearly see the effect of the increasing NTR and energy usage on profitability. You can also see that for deliveries in Dec 14, our systems' $/ Gh/sec are substantially below the benchmark ones (@500 =  $0.82/GH  @450 = $0.73/GH)If the exchange rate varies you will have to correct these figures by the appropriate ratio, and please remember that the Bitcoin’s value might go down as well as up! We are presenting this information not to scare people, but in the interests of full disclosure. Mining Bitcoins is very competitive and we don’t want our customers to imagine what ‘might be’ instead of accepting reality. But, it is possible to get an excellent return from mining if you have the right tools and the right supplier – and that’s where we come in.Top      Back to Index2. Our Systems Lineup
We have designed a family of mining devices targeted towards best possible performance per dollar. We recognise that not everyone can afford to spend thousands of dollars to gain entry to the Bitcoin mining club, so our flagship product isn’t a huge multi terrahash/sec miner (although we’ve got one of those too), it’s a little USB device costing $59 we call the NOVA – S that can be used with its’ supplied AC adapter and a host computer, preferably a laptop, to mine at 128GigaHash/sec. And it’s very well priced : $0.46 per Gigahash/second! 
This is a basic drawing of the USB Miner - NOT an actual product!You can clearly see the main elements of the miner - two 35mm fans blow onto a Pin Fin heatsink, the body of the miner contains the mini hashing module and a power/control board. The back of the ASIC chip die is in direct contact with the underside of the heatsink.The next product in our line is the NOVA - HH which builds on the NOVA – S concept. It isn’t a miner as such, it’s basically a powered 16 port USB hub which can accommodate up to 16 NOVA-S devices. It’s USB ports are very high power – up to 35 watts each. It includes a wifi enabled Raspberry Pi microcomputer which runs the mining software and acts as a bridge to the network, so no host system is needed. You do need a TV or monitor, keyboard and mouse to set it up initially, it’s an easy starter route for those who can’t afford to spend a lot of money in one go to buy one of the bigger rigs, but who can easily add capacity as they earn it! Our system rigs offer hashing power from 1TH/sec up to 8 TH/sec and are based on a common enclosure platform with a form factor of 210W x 300L x 175H; pricing performance runs from $0.25 to $0.50 per GH/sec and if you order early you can get them even cheaper! The system rigs are all modular, so it’s very easy to add or change hashing modules whilst keeping your existing infrastructure. All our systems except the NOVA S USB miner have integrated wifi enabled Raspberry Pi micro computers, so do not need host systems to mine. If you look at our pricing structure and factor in the delivery date as December - February 2014, it is clear that we are offering our Contributors – especially those willing to commit early – a very considerable performance advantage in terms of how quickly they might achieve profitability on their new rig. Furthermore, our modular approach means that they can add or replace the hashing modules as newer ones become available and keep their rig competitive without having to buy a new one. Let’s talk about what makes our products tick:Top      Back to Index3. Our Core Mining Chip
Onto the good stuff now!Our ASIC has been designed to satisfy 3 key requirements:-  High reliability and fault tolerance-  Maximum Hashing performance per $-  Minimum power consumptionThe key to satisfying the second two requirements lies in our use of a Full Custom design. Why is this important?Full Custom versus Gate Based & Standard Cell
If you want to make a silicon chip, there are several routes you can follow to do this. For speed, using a gate-based design is like digital Lego: it uses simple pre-designed blocks of transistors that can be joined together to quickly build your system. The blocks have known, tested performance and have been designed to work in most likely applications. They are used with complex EDA (Electronic Design Automation) software which makes the chip designers’ job a lot easier, especially when it comes to simulating the final chip’s performance and functionality, or so the theory goes. On the downside, gate based designs can be ‘top heavy’ in that they use far more or far bigger transistors in each gate than might be needed for a specific application, and that usually means higher power and more silicon real estate. However, the design path is fast, predictable (usually) and rugged. It’s a very good solution for most small to medium sized designs.Next in line is Standard Cell. It’s broadly similar to gate based design except that larger pre-designed functions are available, such as counters and adders up to floating point units and complete processors, and a designer can use them in a similar ‘Lego like’ fashion to build their circuit, but with less flexible rules. It makes more efficient use of silicon real estate as the functions have been heavily optimised at the transistor level, but again they have to be generic enough to cover a wide range of applications in the real world. The design route is usually easier than gate based as the cells have more functionality and complex functions can be built more easily, though there may be issues with routing signals and timing. For the same function standard cells take up less silicon area than using gates. Usually EDA tools can accommodate both gate and cell based designs, or more usually mixtures of the two. Standard cell is very good for large, complex designs.Finally there’s full custom. This is how chip design started off, manual designs with individual transistors and it’s still very much alive today. Why? Simple answer – efficiency, just like a custom kitchen or suit, you get exactly what you want and need, there’s no waste or extra unused functions. If you have a part in your circuit that has to drive only 2 standard loads, why put in one that’s twice as large that can drive 8? Or use a data register designed for 2 GHz operation that’s three times the size of one for 500MHz? Designing in only what you need can save a lot of transistors so the overall design is much more efficient. Trouble is, it takes a lot more manual involvement from the designer and there are few EDA tools to help, so it costs a lot more. But take heart from the fact that big companies like Intel and AMD have hundreds of engineers designing and building full custom designs every day - just like we'll hopefully be doing soon!Top      .Back to IndexFault Tolerance and Reliability
Our device will be built around an array of 256 dual-SHA256 pipelines (2 x 65 stages in each) which operate as a group. An additional 16 pipelines are also present, but are not mapped into the address space of the main array. Chip performance is 128 Gigahashes/second (GH/s) at rated clock speed of 500Mhz, rated core voltage of 0.8V, die core temperature of 75 degrees Celcius and power consumption of 25 Watts. It is possible to run at a lower core voltage of 0.6V, however until we have working silicon we cannot confirm exact performance at this voltage.Please note that power consumption figures in the paragraph above are for the chip only, and do not include power supply and auxiliary circuit losses. Comprehensive test structures built into the fabric of the device allow for production testing and ‘manufacturability’ analysis. It also enables the HM’s 32 bit microcontroller to carry out automatic full function tests on all pipelines, including the spares. This means that full hashing power is always available as pipelines are constantly ‘rotated’ for testing. Testing takes only takes  a few seconds and  allows the controller to identify any that are faulty;  if one is found, it is temporarily disabled and a ‘spare’ mapped into its address space. A failure may be a temporary fault due to a hotspot, but regular testing will identify if the fault is a genuine failure or intermittent. The pipeline can then be permanently disabled and ‘remembered’ by the system controller as faulty, with a spare taking its place. This all takes place without any user intervention, although test results and pipeline swaps are recorded and can be reviewed at any time.Top      Back to IndexSmall is beautiful – sometimes

When designing a mining ASIC, one of the most important questions is how to implement the physical design: do you have a massive single chip that can do 1TH/sec, or 128 smaller ones at 8GH/sec? Larger chips produce more heat, smaller ones only produce a little but there’s more of them. A larger chip uses a smaller PCB than lots of smaller ones, and there’s fewer connections to the board to go faulty. But a larger chip has a much lower production yield than a much smaller one due to the increased chances of encountering a defect in the silicon wafer used to build it, which means it’s more expensive per GH/sec.What we’re pointing out here is that there’s a balancing act between functionality and cost and it’s interesting to see how other companies have done their designs: some are very small, others very large. We’ve taken the decision to optimise and go right down the middle, so our chip comes in at about 100mm2. This is a manageable size, and still yields reasonably well, its packaged in a Moulded Flip Chip Ball Grid Array package (a bit of a mouthful that so it’s more commonly called MFCBGA) to make the thermal design of our systems efficient, but we’ll come to that later. With a single chip rated at 128GH/sec, Terrahash capability can be easily obtained by using 8 of them. Our design actually use 4 chips in a module, but this will be covered in the section 4. Top      Back to IndexHeat Kills (chips)
We plan to build the ASIC in a 40nm LP medium Vt process, this is a stable and reliable process, very cost effective and relatively low power; you’ll see below that our systems give excellent Watt/GH performance. SHA256 is very power hungry, virtually every transistor in a pipeline switches every clock cycle, so the key to performance is reducing the number of transistors that switch and minimising the power consumption of those that do.  We've implemented the pipeline stages within the SHA256 engine at full custom level as we discussed earlier, it means we can save a huge number of transistors and control the size and hence power consumption of those that remain. We’re also making extensive use of analogue design techniques to minimise noise and reduce supply voltage – again saving power. Every transistor we save, shrink or optimise saves power, and overall this results in greater power efficiency.It’s all very well having high-tech chips that can mine fast, but they also produce a lot of heat. If the chips can’t get rid of the heat they generate quickly enough, their core temperature rockets and this destroys their transistors, so it’s essential to have good thermal management to make sure this doesn’t happen. Rig suppliers have adopted several different ways to accomplish this, usually by a classic fan/heatsink arrangement or water cooling. We looked at both these and other methods, and decided that for maximum reliability we’d go down a fairly conservative route and so use ducted forged pin fin heatsinks with high capacity fans blowing them.This is a good combination and means we can get rid of sufficient heat to keep the chips well within their operating temperature range. It’s also very reliable – it’s easy for the fan controller to determine if a fan has stuck or fused and so close the system down until it’s fixed. We are using continuous duty fans with fluid or ball bearings with expected lifetimes (called MTBF’s – Mean Time Before Failure) of over 100,000 hours. Also, pin fin technology means the sinks are fairly compact, enabling us to pack a lot of hashing capacity into a compact enclosure. A blown pin fin heatsink is also used for the NOVA-S USB miner with very small fans mounted on top of the heatsink, this gives excellent cooling results, even in a hot room.Top      Back to IndexPower Play

Mining Bitcoins consumes large amounts of energy, and will eventually reach a point where the cost of power takes away more than 50% of a miners’ earnings. If you’re an ‘average’ US customer with a current 0.85J/GH rig paying the average rate for your electricity, then this will happen when the NTR hits about 320,000. If you manage to get your hands on a 0.55J/GH rig then the 50/50 point is delayed until 475,000. With a 0.3J/GH rig such as ours it’s nearer 1,050,0000! We’ve designed our systems to consume as little power as possible whilst remaining competitive at hashing; the benefit of using full custom design is that you only use what you need – no wasted resources. Below are our estimates for MAXIMUM power consumption for our systems with all devices running at rated speed, measured at the AC wall socket so including all power supply switching losses and auxiliary circuit power:NOVA-S                 38 watts, 0.30 Joules/GH  (not including host)NOVA-HH              50 watts, 0.40 Joules/GH  With 1 x NOVA - S                                    580 watts, 0.29 Joules/GH  With 16 x NOVA - SNOVA-1 (1 TH/s)  300 watts, 0.30 Joules/GHNOVA-2 (2 TH/s)  580 watts, 0.29 Joules/GHNOVA-4 (4 TH/s)  1100 watts,  0.28 Joules/GHNOVA-8 (8 TH/s)  2150 watts  0.27 Joules/GHYou can see these are very competitive figures, despite us using 40nm technology. And they’ll get even better with our generation 2 40nm chip – some 36% less, we estimate.Top      Back to Index4. Modular Methodology and Value Retention


Past Lessons and Future Plans
Bitcoin mining is a very dynamic industry by nature, things keep changing and the ever rising difficulty means that today’s top of the line mining rig is very soon obsolete, it’s a bit like what happens in the PC industry, except that an old Pentium 4 computer can still perform very useful work, whereas an old mining rig just consumes electricity! The PC industry taught us that a modular approach to systems means that they can be upgraded simply by swapping outdated or inefficient parts, such as DRAM or graphics cards. Yes, you can only do this so often but a lot of the original value of your system can be preserved, and that’s why we’ve chosen a similar route with our miners.It’s a common misconception that most of the cost of a mining rig is in the asic chips. Certainly to engineer, tool and build an ASIC takes millions of dollars, but the actual parts don’t costs that much, in our systems the chips typically account for about 50% of the overall production cost. The rest of the system isn’t necessarily dependent on what’s inside the chips, so careful design can mean that it can be used and reused, much in the same way as a PC chassis. As mining difficulty increases, so miners need more power, either in the form of additions to their rig, or more usually a new setup.We have structured our system design such that it uses multiple modules which can be easily replaced, and our overall design aim is to preserve the value of the system infrastructure for as long as possible. In particular, the system internal power supplies are oversized and the DC-DC converters for chip power have a wide voltage and current operating range meaning they can cope with newer chip technologies. This will help keep our customer competitive – rather than having to buy a whole new rig, they can extend their current one or change the hashing modules for newer technology ones. We’d like to think that other manufacturers might mimic our scheme and produce third party products to fit in our infrastructure.Top  Back to IndexModule Mania
In this section we’ll explore the modules we’ll use, and how they fit into the system. We have five main modules:A Hashing Module (HM) that contains 4 mining chips, a 32 bit microcontroller, USB interface and some support circuitry; very easy to install and/or replace. Self – testing without system controller intervention.A Micro Hashing Module (MHM) that is essentially a smaller HM with only 1 mining chip, it has the same 32 bit microcontroller, USB interface and support circuits and is used in the NOVA – S USB miner.A Controller Board (CB) that consists of multiple USB hubs, fan control circuitry and auxiliary power regulators. It’s also used in the NOVA HH powered hub.A High Current Power Supply (HCPS) – 1 for each HM – that incorporates a 200 amp capable variable voltage regulator used to supply power to the HM chips. HCPS modules take in regulated 12V DC power supplied from an internal PSU – there is no need to buy a separate power supply - and sit ‘piggyback’ on top of an HM, a low resistance plug and socket arrangement is used to connect the two together. The HCPS automatically senses the HM type and adjusts its’ output to suit. This means it can be used with future HM’s which will most likely require lower voltage, but more current.HM’s and HCPS’s are both based on a 60 x 96 mm pcb platform.The NOVA – S USB miner also has an HCPS device UPCU – USB Power Control Unit, but it’s integrated with a fan controller and is designed to take power from an external AC adapter which comes with the miner. Please note that full performance at 128GH/sec is only available when using the supplied AC adapter due to the current limitation of standard USB ports; using maximum available USB 2.0 current alone will give limit performance to around 8 - 10GH/sec, USB 3.0 will allow approximately 20GH/sec.A fifth module, a Raspberry Pi single board computer with  Wi-Fi capability is used as a 'bridge' between the miner and the Bitcoin Network, it also allows system monitoring and configuration when connected to an external TV (or monitor), keyboard and mouse. The Pi will run a customised version of the excellent Minepeon software. With all of our systems except the NOVA-S, you don't need an external host computer to mine.Top      Back to Index5. How big is your Rig?
Now we’ve got all this technology, we need to put it in a box to keep everything tidy. We’ve designed a ‘standard’ enclosure which measures 210mm W x 175mm H x 300mm L, and it can accommodate up to 8 HM’s, ie 4TH.  The NOVA 8 miner uses two standard modules coupled together. A standard enclosure can accommodate 2 800W High Efficiency power supplies, 1 for each 2TH of capacity. We’ve done this to maximise system reliability and to aid those of you unfortunate enough to have to rely on 110V AC supplies! The power supplies sit in the lower portion of the rig, the Raspberry Pi and the USB hubs are contained in the mid portion and the actual HM’s and HCPS’s in the top, together with the pin fin heatsink.Top      Back to Index6. So what can my Rig do for Me?
Have you ever seen a mining rig supplier exploring this subject in their sale pitch? No? Ever wondered why? It’s really simple – too much information given to buyers might put them off purchasing. Rig manufacturers know that most Bitcoin miners dream of making millions of dollars from their mining activities, and it’s much better to let them hold onto that dream; a dose of reality might stop them buying. Well, we’re engineers and don’t believe in fantasy, just facts, so please read the following three points very carefully:Fact 1:  Bitcoin mining isn’t an investment – it’s a gamble, albeit one with semi predictable oddsFact 2: Even an 8TH rig isn’t going to make you a fortune, unless there’s a dramatic rise in BTC valueFact 3: You can get a very reasonable return from mining – potentially better than most conventional investment vehicles – if you have the right information, right equipment and the right supplier.So now that we’ve made you aware of the pitfalls, let’s look at what you might be able to achieve:From Jan 2014 to Jan 2015 (365 days), based on our NTR / DIF prediction and 1BTC = $500, we estimate a NOVA-1 1 TH/sec rig, taking into account costs of electricity and mining pool fees could earn you:$1322 based on average current US residential power costs (estimated at 12cents per kWh in 2015) or$1037 based on corresponding UK figures (estimated at 23 cents per kWh in 2015)On a purchase price of $499 and shipping/tax charges of $110, then a US rig will provide net earnings of ($1322 - $499 - $110) = $713, or ROI (Return On Investment) of 143%, less taxes you may have to pay on your income, but you still have the value of the hardware and it will continue to earn money. We don’t have detailed figures up to the end of 2016, but predict the net earnings would be $602 for the US, $350 for the UK (with power costs rising by an estimated  5%).At the other end of the scale, a US based NOVA-8 systems’ 2015 figure is $10,576 deducting initial costs, shipping and taxes gives net earnings of (10,576- $2799 - $160) = $7,617, or ROI of 272%. (For the UK the figures are $8,296 - $2799 - $600, ie $4897 or ROI of 175%). Both figures are again less any payable personal or corporate taxes. Why the large difference? It’s all down mainly to those power costs (and UK VAT). Of course this analysis is only looking at payment over a long period of time, mining rewards are paid out regularly if you’re using a pool as most miners are, this then gives you the opportunity to buy more hashing power as you get more funds. In case you missed it, that was a sneaky introduction for our Guaranteed Supply Program or GSP, it’s another part of our product offering which will continue to give our customers a financial advantage once they have started mining with our productsTop      Back to Index7. Guaranteed Supply Program and 'Jane'
OK, you’ve got your new mining rig and it’s happily earning its keep. You’ve got some Bitcoins (or cash), and would like more Hashing power NOW. Trouble is, all the competitive products have waiting lists of months. Sound familiar? We are offering some of our early Indiegogo contributors a unique program where we will guarantee them almost immediate delivery on up to an additional 3 times the original hashing power they purchased, PLUS discounted rates on the upgrade hardware! This applies only if they are Fortune 500 customers or the first 500 who purchased a 49’er in each of the main rig categories, it doesn’t include the NOVA-S or NOVA HH product.There will be a 3 month period after their delivery date where this kicks in, after that they can order up to 3 times their original hashing power as hashing modules or full systems at the rate of one upgrade of 1 x per month up to one year from their original delivery date. Of course, they can order as much hashing power as they like at any time, but delivery will depend on order backlog and available capacity; they would still get a discount but not as much as they would get buying via GSP. Here’s an example of how the GSP might work in the real world.The spreadsheet below shows a running mining earnings balance for Jane, who lives in Colorado. She’s one of the first to order a NOVA-1 1TH system and it’s delivered on January 4 2015. As time goes on her rig earns Bitcoins which she converts to cash. When she has enough money, she uses her GSP status and buys 1TH upgrades at $249 each – she’s already paid for the electricity to run her rig costing 12 cents per kWh, the US average in 2015. She gets her modules within 10 days of ordering, and soon she’s hashing with more power, making more money for the rest of the month. And so this process repeats until Jane has used up her GSP credits.

By Jan 4 2016 Jane’s now 4 TH rig has generated her net $2,721, and that’s including paying for upgrades and the electricity to run it. That’s not bad for a $499 initial purchase! Over the following 12 months it will make her a further net $2,408 even allowing for energy bills going up by 5%. She’s not getting rich by any stretch of the imagination, but we imagine she’d be more than happy that she signed up early to buy her rig. Now, if Jane lived in California or other areas with high energy costs, she might be paying twice (or more) the US average electricity costs; this will have a significant effect on her earnings, but what can a miner situated in a high energy cost region do? Well, we may have a solution to that problem for our early customers, but it depends on to what level we get funded as it relies on a lot of investment in infrastructure.We again have to point out that the financial predictions shown above depend on a lot of factors, most of which cannot be predicted to any degree of precision and they are given for illustration purposes ONLY. They are not guaranteed or warranted in any way, and we would advise any potential buyer to undertake their own research and solicit opinion from a variety of sources.Top      Back to IndexFrequently Asked Questions:
Q. This all sounds far too good to be true. How can you possibly build systems at this price when others are charging 3 or more times as much for the same hashing power?A. We expect that this a question most people will ask. There are 3 separate parts to the answer:Firstly, we have a lot of experience in the design and manufacture of consumer electronic systems, so we know how to design and build at the lowest possible cost. We’re using well-established methods to source competitive, competent suppliers and subcontractors who will manufacture the component parts of the systems so all we’re doing is final assembly and test.Secondly, by using full custom 40nm technology we save over $1.3M in development costs versus 28nm- that’s $130 a unit for 10k units in engineering charges alone. Device gate density doesn’t count in SHA256 – it’s the number of transistors switching per clock, their power consumption and power dissipation capability of the die that limits performance, so our full custom design approach means our 40nm device can easily outperform a gate or standard cell based 28nm design.Don’t believe us? Read the excellent book by David Chinnery & Kurt Keuzer:""Closing the Power Gap between ASIC and Custom; Tools and Techniques for Low Power Design"" (Springer); ISBN-13: 978-0387257631 Lastly, and most importantly, our whole business ethos is built upon maintaining a level playing field for our customers in mining and that means we have to be a volume supplier. Volume means savings in parts cost, (aided by modularity) and lower cost to the customer. It also means we’re content to make a modest margin, not what we think the market will ‘bear’. If we can build and sell an 8TH system for $2799 - including its share of the development and tooling costs – and make a decent profit then so can every other supplier. Ask yourself why their prices are so high. TopQ. You mention mining companies a few times – why do you see them as such a problem?A. Bitcoin was always meant to be free of any centralised control, that means that everyone can participate, and this should apply to mining also. If you have too much power concentrated in the hands of a few individuals or organisations it can severely disadvantage others. As newer, more expensive technologies come on - line, mining will end up being the sole preserve of the wealthy or dedicated companies, especially those who can afford to develop their own ASICs – and some have clearly already done so. Then what happens to ordinary miners? They can never get hold of hardware at the same $/GH figures the mining companies enjoy– unless they come to us. TopQ. You’re a UK company, so why do you want to be paid in US dollars?A. Over 90% of our costs are in dollars, so it makes more sense for us to get paid in them. TopQ. Why don't you take Paypal?A. It's simply not a suitable solution for this type of program. We can't plan development of complex systems when some contributors - or malevolent competitors - may decide to cancel their contribution within 90 days. That potentially messes up the project for everyone else that's contributed.TopQ. Is there a limit as to how many systems I can buy?A. Within reason, no. Indiegogo has limits on how much you can contribute in one transaction, please go to http://support.indiegogo.com/entries/20494567-how-to-contribute-to-a-campaign for more information on this. Essentially you pay on purchase so if you try to buy 10k$ worth you’ll need that on your card. TopQ. Can’t you deliver the systems quicker? The longer delivery takes, the less I make!A. That’s not possible. We don’t give over-optimistic, unachievable timescales. But if you’re willing to wait, you’ll get the best possible return per dollar, your system will remain competitive for some time to come and you can easily upgrade it with newer technology without having to replace it completely.TopQ. Why aren’t you using 28nm technology like everyone else?A. For this project, 40nm is very cost efficient. Our design is very compact and efficient and so can compete with current 28nm (and even 20nm) offerings. We want to keep costs low for our customers and that’s exactly what’s been achieved – unbeatable $/GH values. What’s the gain for our customers if we using a more advanced and costly technology?However, if we get significantly overfunded to a minimum of $11.5 million then we’ll consider using the extra profit we’ll make to fund development of a 28nm chip instead of our original 40nm design, (although we’re pretty confident that the rev 2 40nm chip will give just as good financial results). A 28nm design would contain twice as many pipelines on the same die size, but run at a lower clock frequency of 366 MHz, giving a hashing speed per chip of  192GH/sec, ie a speed increase of 50%, meaning that a NOVA-1 miner would run at 1.5TH/sec at the same power consumption as the 40nm solution!TopQ. Will you be making other Bitcoin related products in the future?A. Definitely. For a start, we plan to introduce the Generation 2 HMs in early 2015 to give our existing customers an upgrade path which will prolong their competitive advantage. We will be implementing some alternative low power structures in the initial chips, and the results from these will shape the exact design of the next generation chips.TopQ. I like the modular approach and upgrade path, but at this time I’m one of the people you mentioned that has limited funds, so can only afford the basic system. Can I upgrade it before the delivery date, and how much would it cost?A. The short answer is a qualified ‘yes’, but please bear in mind that we have to be fair to everyone in the queue. If systems were available you would have to go to the back of the delivery queue, otherwise we would have lots of people ordering the 1 TH system then asking to upgrade it to a 8TH one before delivery, and that’s unfair.TopQ. Will Novello be mining Bitcoins as well as making Rigs?A. That’s clearly a case of conflict of interest, so no. Who on earth would want to buy from a company that’s a direct competitor? Worse still, how could any normal company with any ethics expect their customers to accept such behaviour?TopQ. What’s in it for you by offering GSP?A. We have a different business model in that we want to keep our customers profitable and buying more TH from us and will give them major incentives to do so – they can keep competitive no matter what happens to the NTR and DIF. In GSP we give them availability of new hashing capacity when it’s most needed – there’s no catch, just a new way of looking at the supplier/miner partnership.TopQ. Are you going to sell the chips separately?A. Yes, we’d very much like to do this and to encourage people within the Bitcoin community to experiment with our ASIC and make their own rigs. The ASICs are able to run at higher clock speeds and we are keen to gather data from users on how far they can be pushed. But first we have to be satisfied that we can supply a device with the same standards of support and documentation as a commercial one. This won’t be possible until about January 2015, by which time we hope to have appointed a distributor – ideally from within the Bitcoin community – to coordinate sale and support. As for third party system builders, we can’t really see how they could compete against our product pricing as they have to buy chips from us, but that’s not saying that we wouldn’t do it if there is enough interest.TopQ. How accurate are the power estimates?A. We have extensive experience with this technology, and our figures are based on existing structures that are already in production, so our figures are accurate to about +/-10%.TopQ. I like the self-repair function, but I’d rather have the extra pipelines to use for hashing. Is this possible and can the ASIC devices be overclocked?A. The short answer to the first part is no. As regards the second part, the ASICs are capable of running at higher speeds, but then the power dissipation goes up and so does the die junction temperature. At this stage we’d rather that customers accept the system specifications as they are; once we complete system integration and testing, it may be that the power consumption is lower than our worst case predictions and so clock speeds can be increased. We’ll keep all customers advised on this as testing progresses.TopQ. Are you sure your NTR/DIF figures are accurate? Some people on the web say they’ll be a lot higher!A. Realistically, the NTR and DIF can only rise so fast due to a number of reasons, mainly that as they rise, earnings fall, and that deters purchases of new hashing capacity. The mining companies are mostly banked by Venture Capital investors, and they’ll not put money into ventures that can’t give them a set return in a reasonably short period. We don’t have a crystal ball, but we do have our own modelling program that simulates what we think happens in the real life Bitcoin market. Of course, it’s not 100% accurate, but it can track rig buying behaviour reasonably well, so we’re sure the figures will stand up to scrutiny.TopQ. What’s the system’s warranty?A. As standard, a 2 year Return to Base. We’ll be operating an RMA (Return Material Authorisation) process so that if a customer encounters a problem, they go through a ‘diagnostic’ procedure to make sure the fault is real. This saves time and money. Return postage costs will be paid by Novello, providing that the system warranty has not been voided in any way, and that the fault is genuine.Top",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

Pawly in the Press





























""It solves the problem of not being physically present. The ability to actually interact in such a physical manner with the Pawly is definitely appealing."" - Robert Hybki, Price Stylist

""It's a unique, two way form of remote interaction never before availble to pets and their owners."" - Brian Reynolds, Get Leashed Magazine

""The Pawly team is perhaps the best example of what can be accomplished at a Startup Weekend when you combine great skill, motiviation and impressive teamwork."" - Chris Eben, TWG


A Peace of Mind





Busy pet parents worry about their furry friends when leaving them home alone for long hours. Are they bored? Are they eating your slippers or sleeping on the forbidden couch? Pawly helps you be a better pet parent by allowing you to check in throughout the day.


Playtime





Pets tend to get bored, especially when they’re home alone for long hours of the day. When your dog gets bored, they begin to look for ways to entertain themselves. Excessive barking, inappropriate chewing, and other destructive behaviours can occur. With Pawly, you can log into the mobile app from anywhere to interact and even reward your pets using the Treat Blaster.


Never Miss a Moment





With Pawly’s app, you can snap and record precious moments of your pets and even upload them online and share them with your family and friends. Owners can also give permission to their family and friends who miss their pets to control Pawly remotely.


Be a Better Pet Parent





Monitor and catch your pet’s behaviour before it develops into a much bigger problem. Capture and show the footage to your pet trainer or the vet for tips and feedback.

Pet Industry


59% of pet-owners claim the bond they share with their pet is strong, if not stronger than their bond with family or friends. In essence, pet-owners are spending much more on pet  products and supplies for their beloved furry friends, even during the recession! Designer products and high-tech gadgets such as automated food dispensers and wearable GPS  collars don’t sound too farfetched anymore. Even services such as beauty salons and pet daycares can cost up to $550/month! With the benefits of pet companionship and the overall change in attitudes towards pets, we wanted to fill the gap with a product that is both meaningful and affordable.


Interesting Facts


14-35% of dogs have separation anxiety. This percentage gets much higher in senior dogs that ranges from 29-50%.
Pets that are bored can take out their boredom in many ways. When your dog gets bored, they begin to look for ways to entertain themselves. Excessive barking, inappropriate chewing, and other destructive behaviours can occur.
When a dog is alone for majority of the day without any exercise, they risk of becoming overweight with higher chances of diabetes, respiratory diseases, heart disease, and arthritis.

Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is a process of making a three-dimensional solid object of virtually any shape from a digital model. 3D printing is achieved using an additive process, where successive layers of material are laid down in different shapes. 3D printing is also considered distinct from traditional machining techniques, which mostly rely on the removal of material by methods such as cutting or drilling (subtractive processes).







... the story

A materials printer usually performs 3D printing processes using digital technology. The first working 3D printer was created in 1984 by Chuck Hull of 3D Systems Corp. Since the start of the 21st century there has been a large growth in the sales of these machines, and their price has dropped substantially. According to Wohlers Associates, a consultancy, the market for 3D printers and services was worth $2.2 billion worldwide in 2012, up 29% from 2011.







What can you use 3D printing technology for?



The 3D printing technology is used for both prototyping and distributed manufacturing with applications in architecture, construction (AEC), industrial design, automotive, aerospace, military, engineering, civil engineering, dental and medical industries, biotech (human tissue replacement), fashion, footwear, jewelry, eyewear, education, geographic information systems, food, and many other fields. It has been speculated that 3D printing may become a mass market item because open source 3D printing can easily offset their capital costs by enabling consumers to avoid costs associated with purchasing common household objects.

... examples of 3D printing:


iPhone case




Jewelry


                       

Chess




Any type of gadget ... like this !!!



... or this !!! (for any Star Wars fan obviously) :D



Maybe there is some Shakespeare follower ?



Whatever you want !!! Send us your project and we will 3D-print it !!!

not only a simply calendar, it helps you to organize your week and duties of your
week. Moreover there is lot of space for your ideas and drawings. Everybody has
a smartphone, we also have but in it you cannot manage your duties, you only
see dots and small markers on the screen if you have more than five meetings in
a week. 

<p>We have tried different kind of
diaries, calendars, to do lists and apps to save time, to do better and faster
work at the office. But there is some problem with every type, for example if
you are speaking on your phone you cannot make notes in it. Or in a calendar
there is not enough space for your creative ideas, drawings. So we try to do
the best calendar with great functions, planners, and more space.<span>  <br/></span></p>

not only a simply calendar, it helps you to organize your week and duties of your
week. Moreover there is lot of space for your ideas and drawings. Everybody has
a smartphone, we also have but in it you cannot manage your duties, you only
see dots and small markers on the screen if you have more than five meetings in
a week. 

We have tried different kind of
diaries, calendars, to do lists and apps to save time, to do better and faster
work at the office. But there is some problem with every type, for example if
you are speaking on your phone you cannot make notes in it. Or in a calendar
there is not enough space for your creative ideas, drawings. So we try to do
the best calendar with great functions, planners, and more space.  






                             Absolutely ergonomic for your workspace



The whole year could be over viewed
on the double page. Period of the projects and holidays :) could be marked
easily.

We
all like long-term plans, this
can be done on the double page. There
is special place for every idea and deadline check box. We can categorize the ideas
such as websites, companies, etc.

<h3>RipRunner-- a saw guide that makes your circular saw a versatile tool</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Our project is a new type of circular saw guide that makes many types of jobs-- especially handling sheet goods, field work, and ripping -- easier, safer and faster.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">This tool started as a simple jig-- I love woodworking, but cannot afford a big shop with a huge table saw.  My brother made a copy of the jig, and found it was awesome for use for projects around the church.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Armed with a RipRunner, and your trusty circular saw, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trim full 4x8 sheets to size as accurately as a panel saw, more safely than with a table saw, and more quickly than either.</li>
<li>Make accurate rips in long lumber in the field, without a table saw</li>
<li>Make 1/8"" thick lattice, wedges, and other fancy stuff by ripping 2x4 's</li>
<li>Make odd ( not square ) cuts needed in the field as easily as square ones</li>
<li>Cut very wide dimensional lumber and trim doors</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">This tool is a must-have for weekend warriors, church volunteer work, and onsite projects. You can see the RipRunner in action at our website  <a href=""http://www.riprunner.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.riprunner.com</a>  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Our next step is to take RipRunner at a large tool show (like <a href=""http://www.nationalhardwareshow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""http://www.nationalhardwareshow.com"">http://www.nationalhardwareshow.com</a>) to get it some attention. Doing that will require some funding, and that's where you come in. Funds will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Show registration and fees</strong>. We'll need at least $3,000 for a booth, plus travel expenses ( about $2,000 ), shipping for the prototypes and other expenses.</li>
<li>
<strong>Production of industrial quality units</strong>. We started with hand-made prototypes, and supporters will receive parts made in our shop with our basic CNC equipment. But for a show, we'll need to get some professionally made parts that look nicer and more polished. This will run $5,000 for a set of 25.</li>
<li>
<strong>Improvements to fit more saws</strong>. Our current model fits all saws commercially available at big box stores, but we'd like to continue developing the device to fit an even greater number.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We have put our last remaining capital and a lot of 'sweat equity' into 45 prototypes, which are ready to ship to 45 generous supporters. We'll make more as needed, but making the others will take some time. We may need to make more than 300 units to make our goal, which will be a lot of time in the shop!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Armed with funding from the campaign, we expect that we'll complete all units promised to supporters by September of this year, after which we can file for a patent, get to work making another set of tools, and then register for a tool show.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We have rewards for supporters at many levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Plans </strong>allow supporters to make their own RipRunner at a minimum cost</li>
<li>
<strong>RipRunners</strong> are available as perks for supporters at medium levels.  We have 45 units ready to ship, so supporters at higher levels will receive those.  We will make the remainder after the campaign ends.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ultimate kits</strong> include assembled guides and pre-drilled track, with mounting hardware, which can be hard to find locally.</li>

<strong>Mack daddy supporters </strong>receive and ultimate kit and also mention on our website</li>

<h3><strong>Why RipRunner?</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Making stuff is cool.  I love it, and I know lots of people do.  The problem is that woodworking can be so expensive, and it is very frustrating when the 'right tools' and the 'right shop' are out of reach.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The RipRunner is awesome because it allows the use of a fairly inexpensive and portable tool-- a circular saw-- to do high quality work even in a confined area.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">For the weekend warrior this is great, but it is _really_ handy for volunteer work, when a lot of the work is done in the field by volunteers who are not professionals.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We think this tool is a game changer for many kinds of jobs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>More about the RipRunner</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The RipRunner is made of two main parts. The first part, the saw guide, attaches to your circular saw. The guide attaches to the saw using toggle clamps, and guides the saw along a track. Most of the design effort required was to fit the wide variety of saws available.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The track serves two purposes-- it guides the saw in a straight line, and it serves as a zero-clearance edge that allows making very precise, clean cuts without the need to mark a line or eyeball where the blade will touch.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The guide is first adjusted to fit the saw-- this can be done without any tools or modifications to the saw. Once complete, the guide and be removed and re-fit without further adjustment.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The track is affixed to a base stock ( typically 3/8"" plywood ), and then the saw is used to cut the base stock flush with the blade kerf. After this cut, the saw will always cut a perfect line along the edge of the base as it rides on the track.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">To use the guide, the user simply clamps the track assembly to the work, and guides the saw along the track.</p>
<h3>The BackStory</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The RipRunner started as a simple jig. I have a very small shop and a very small table saw-- too small to handle full sheets of plywood. I also typically work on my own, so muscling plywood onto the saw is dangerous and difficult.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Typical projects started by paying the orange box store to make panel saw cuts before the project started. These cuts are of limited accuracy -- not to mention leaving me with the feeling there must be a better way. I thought about that better way every time I watched cuts on a panel saw at the store.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Finally, one weekend I spent some time to make a jig. In my case, I simply modified my circular saw. The jig worked well-- I could easily and accurately cut full sheets to size. I showed it to my brother, John when he visited one weekend.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">John just had to have one-- he'd had the same problems dealing with large stock. But alas, I'd just knocked this thing together, and it only fit my saw. Further it required modifying the saw-- and his saw being a nice yellow model, this was something he was not willing to do. A new design was required.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">After a few months, we had a design that would fit his saw-- and of course I wanted the new hotness too. We made a couple-- and John put his to work on a couple of projects for his church. Then, things got interesting.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">John discovered two things on his projects at the church:</p>
<ul>
<li>The jig didn't just work well, it could handle an amazing variety of tasks we hadn't thought of.</li>
<li>Everyone who saw one and owned a circular saw wanted one.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">John called me up to ask if we could make a few more for his friends. We tweaked the design to fit all the current models of saw available at the big box stores. We made 5 more prototypes by hand for people who had expressed interest, but we still had unfilled orders!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Now it was decision time. We did some patent searches, and found that nothing like this existed. We decided the next step was to try to reach a larger market-- but how?</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">We ponied up $2,000 to make 50 prototypes and secure a provisional patent. John handled 'marketing' while I handled production. Six months later, they were complete, and we learned about indiegogo. And here we ( and you ) are!</p>

</ol><p> </p><h3>ELIO Story</h3><p>My daughter who is 5<sup>th</sup> grade made a moving car in her school. The car was so simple, switch operated toy. She sent the car to her sister on the other side by hand, since the car has no control function. I saw them for a while, and said them “Do you want to control the car with the smartphone?” “Yes” She replied with a twinkle in her eyes. The next day, I brought the toy to my Lab and installed a simple Bluetooth module to control it. I gave the car to my daughter and she loved it. However, she asked me “what should I do to go back?”, “How can I move it to the left and the right?”. Those questions motivated me to make a simple controller that creators can handle without technical expertise. Now, I want to share what I made with others.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511349664/hcmkh8evzueq71rdlhmv.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>Rewards</h3><p>1.

That is why we are developing our bespoke system. Our mission is to provide people from all over the world with a unique encrypted communication and collaboration system.    Our Zero-Knowledge platform is created with OpenPGP integrated on application level and TLS on transport level. We use the Privacy by Design approach which ensures that privacy is taken into account throughout the engineering process.  Our servers are located in Switzerland in a former military bunker deep in the Swiss Alps. There all our user’s data is protected by Swiss laws and is outside of all foreign government’s jurisdictions (including EU and US), and intelligence agencies reach.  Encryption is the process of encoding communication. It sounds complicated, however it is pretty easy to use. Encryption happens behind the scenes on your device. When data is transferred to our server it is already encrypted. Even in the case of network or server compromise, nobody can access your data, even we can’t. The interface for all features is intuitive.Here is how the mobile app interface looks like: We have created an end-to-end encrypted email mobile apps that you can use for FREE anywhere and anytime.  But, we do not want to stop there. The pledged money will be used to faster roll-out new SSD features. Below are our stretch goals:  We are very passionate about our mission and we need community help to speed things up because we know we can release all features within the next 6 to 12 months with additional funding. Without additional funding, it will take much much longer.                                                                                                    Q. Do I really need to encrypt my communications online? Nowadays we communicate via email on a daily basis, we store our passwords and important information in notes, we add location and description of our meeting to calendar etc. If this information will be stolen it can lead to identity theft, financial loss or other unwanted consequences.   If you will use an encrypted communications system from Secure Swiss Data:  
It would be near to impossible for hackers to still your data and use it against you 
You’ll be protected from any type of surveillance 
Your data wouldn’t be scanned for marketing purposes and your information wouldn’t be sold to anyone  
Q. Is Secure Swiss Data free?  Yes, Secure Swiss Data is a free encrypted email service provider. You can register your SSD account with 500 Mb of storage for no cost. In the future, you'll be able to upgrade your account and add extra features (like encrypted calendar, file storage, notes, etc.) by subscribing to our individual paid plans. You can preorder them with discount by backing our project.   You can try free SSD account now.Q. Mainstream email services like Google, Yahoo, Microsoft claim to protect users’ privacy. How are you different from them?  With SSD your emails and other data are secured with end-to-end encryption. What is more, our “Zero-knowledge” ethos ensures all user data are transferred encrypted to the server. This means we can never put you under surveillance. We don’t track you for marketing purposes or collect any information about you, so you can be assured that you’ll see no Ads and your data will never be sold to any third party.  In addition, your data is stored under 320m of granite in a Swiss mountain and protected by Swiss law.  Q. How are you different from the other encrypted email providers?  We’re planning on providing you not only with an encrypted email service, but we want to protect your privacy with the first in the world encrypted calendar, encrypted file storage, messenger app, tasks and notes. You’ll be able to use the single platform to protect your communications online. It will save your time and money.Q. You have a .com domain. Isn’t this under the US control? No, .com domain is not controlled by the US government. All domain names are managed by non-governmental and non-profit organization ICANN.   Irrelatively what domain you will choose out of 30 domains we offer (.ch, .eu, .net etc.) your data will be protected by Swiss laws. It can NOT be accessed by the US or EU governments, as our servers are located in Switzerland. Q. When can I expect to get my perk?  Some features that we are creating have never been developed before.  The timeline of our releases is provided here. We will do our best to provide you with a timely delivery of the perks.   Q.  I detest credit card payments. Have you got a BTC address I can donate to? You are in luck. We do happen to have a Bitcoin address.Q. How is SSD funded so far?  So far, Secure Swiss Data was privately funded by our founders that are passionate about improving online security and want to provide us all with an opportunity to protect our online privacy.  Q. How can I help you beyond a contribution on Indiegogo? Please, share this campaign on social media and spread the word about Secure Swiss Data to your friends and colleagues, because most of us have nothing to hide, but we all have something to lose. Q. Can businesses use Secure Swiss Data too? Yes, Secure Swiss Data is planning on providing business solutions for the business in the future. Once the crowdfunding campaign ends and we will accomplish our goals, our development team will start working on business solutions for our B2B customers. Q. How can I contact you if I have more questions? Please feel free to reach us at support@secureswissdata.com Also, you can contact us through our social media pages: Facebook and Twitter .  The secure communications system for all!  You are welcome to help us make the online world more secure by spreading the word about Secure Swiss Data and this campaign!",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

The right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy) This fundamental right has been ethically and constitutionally endangered by the shady use of technology, raising concerns on how to fortify ourselves and the world from the threat of privacy infringement that companies, governments and other malicious factors are posing. In opposition to the rapid advancement in technology in our days, there is a lack of the proper education and information for the public on this field. Source: https://blog.keepersecurity.com/2017/01/13/most-common-passwords-of-2016-research-study/ By just taking a look at the list above you can realize the magnitude of the problem raised.

<strong>Hi Everyone!</strong>
<p>This really is a concept for everyone. It will benefit everyone who eats food! It will benefit the environment while providing safe and nutritious food for any user anywhere on the planet.</p>
<p>Green Farm Bio Tech is the name of our grass roots organic farming technologies company. We are so grass roots we do not even have a website yet lol! - but that is coming. We are two guys who have backgrounds in basic farming and animal husbandry as well as a self taught approach to agro-biochemistry utilizing purely organic methods from start to finish. We have created pro-biotic formulas and processes that enhance and inoculate fertilizers, crops and the animals that consume them - including us humans.</p>
<p>In a nut shell we have come up with a total organic farming system that uses no chemicals, no growth hormones, no pharmaceutical injections and yet achieves a healthier and more nutritious end product at LESS than the cost of contemporary industrial and commercial farming practices.</p>
<p>To be absolutely honest we are hoping to get rich ourselves eventually, from our discoveries and hard work. However, we would also like to share the wealth with our contributors by offering them future investment opportunities with Green Farm Bio Tech for any size contribution. All contributors will be placed on a priority investors list. Contributors will also receive regular updates and progress reports through our soon to be launched website.</p>
<p>Our fertilizers are entirely organic. Our water and feed enhancers are entirely organic. We have designed a fermentation process to create entirely organic livestock inoculations which amazingly eradicate E-coli, Salmonella and other harmful pathogens without using the drugs and chemicals that are commonly incorporated into mainstream commercial farming practices.</p>
<p>All of these products are completely safe and actually beneficial to the surrounding environment - unlike contemporary commercial farming practices that are big polluters both to ground water and to the air we breathe.</p>
<p>So why are we here on this website asking for help?  Well, over the last 6 years I have invested about $27,000 of my hard earned money on developing these wonderful organic systems and products while my friend and business partner has invested more than double that amount. We have made great steps towards our goal of bringing our products and processes to the public awareness and thus into mainstream utilization - BUT and yes of course here is the 'but' - we are at the stage where we need to set up a series of tests under the auspices of some professors we have lined up to work with us in order to scientifically (and empirically) validate our results - in other words, we have to prove that our stuff works!</p>
<p>In order to achieve these results and to be able to present them to the public and industry we must build a much more elaborate small scale pilot bio-organic farming system in which to incorporate the necessary controls for the comparisons which will be made using the strict empirical approach standard to all properly conducted testing procedures.</p>
<p>To make that happen we need to lease a piece of agricultural land suitable to construct the testing facility. And then of course we need to build the animal pens, composting stations, laboratory hut, fermentation hut, irrigation and feed system to name a few things. The duration of the testing phase will be 12 to 16 months depending on various factors and that is once we have the above infrastructure in place. Thus we are estimating a cost for this 'phase 2' at approximately $200,000. We have come to this website - with hats in hands hoping (and praying!) that we could assemble about $150,000 of the estimated $200,000 we will need to advance this project. The remainder of funds will be assembled by my partner and I with the help of friends and family.</p>
<p>The benefits to people everywhere are easy to envision and self-evident so I don't think I need to state them - just use your imagination - the sky is indeed the limit for the applications we have developed!</p>
<p>They suggest at indiegogo.com that we state what's in it for you if you decide our project merits a contribution. Well, we would be honored to know each and every contributor and we would love to provide regular updates to contributors once we have a website up and running. We commit to that certainly and we make that pledge to you.</p>
<p>Simply put, it would be our privilege to involve you in any way you would like. Perhaps you may like to become involved in the testing phase itself and we would not be opposed to that possibility. Or maybe some Warren Buffet or Bill Gates type might read this and want to fund the whole project and become a partner - hint hint, lol!</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps one day you may want to come and work for our company when we eventually launch Green Farm Bio Tech on to the world stage. Thanks for reading our pitch and stay in touch.</p>
<p>Here we go!</p>

<h3>Focusing on You, the Writer</h3>
<p>Today’s word processors’ largely concern themselves with one function - <strong>formatting content</strong>. Whether it’s page breaks, margins, fonts or layouts for images and graphs, they are packed with a host of tools to help you decide how to style your content. But what about <strong>you</strong>, the writer? Are modern writing programs equipped to handle your unique work-flow, writing style, and ever-changing mood?</p> <h3>A Powerfully Flexible Writing Space</h3>
<p><strong>Trestle </strong>is a <strong>free </strong>upcoming writing app that allows you to craft your own writing space and work the way you want - like you would on a real desk.</p> <p>The first thing when using Trestle will be the… whole lot of nothing. But don’t fret! You’ll soon realize that writing on Trestle is <strong>unlike anything</strong> you’ve ever experienced. While strikingly empty in the beginning you can fill the layout with powerful tools we call widgets. These widgets offer distinctive features such as Time, Notes, or Tasks that sort of act like a separate app on their own. You can add, remove, resize, and reposition these widgets anywhere you see fit! Before you know it you’ll have your perfect workspace - whether that’s a word processing powerhouse or a zenlike minimalist writer. And to top it off, you can even customize the design of your new workspace with our lovely <strong>Themes</strong>.</p>

<p>Trestle implements features into containers called Widgets. Each Widget has a function such as time, notes, or tasks. This reduces unnecessary tools and the complexity of finding features while making tools you need much more <strong>accessible </strong>in the feature. Need to find a widget you need?

<h3>Help create Trestle</h3>
<p>Trestle has come a long way since it was just an idea. More specifically, we’ve been working on the technology of Trestle for a few months and have recently started working on the user experience. We currently have a <strong>prototype </strong>that contains the <strong>core functionalities</strong>. It is being developed actively but has quite a way to go.</p>
<p>We want to bring Trestle to you guys as soon as possible and want to make an official release in the next <strong>6 months</strong>. The vast majority of the funds raised here will go towards feeding us with enough caffeine and sugar to help construct Trestle as soon as possible. As we’re working on the project with no other source of income, any help would be appreciated! Another big portion will go towards maintaining Trestle’s infrastructure (things like servers!). Help fund Trestle and we’ll promise to deliver a<strong> writing app you’ll fall in love with</strong>.</p>

Today’s word processors’ largely concern themselves with one function - formatting content. Whether it’s page breaks, margins, fonts or layouts for images and graphs, they are packed with a host of tools to help you decide how to style your content. But what about you, the writer? Are modern writing programs equipped to handle your unique work-flow, writing style, and ever-changing mood? A Powerfully Flexible Writing Space
Trestle is a free upcoming writing app that allows you to craft your own writing space and work the way you want - like you would on a real desk. The first thing when using Trestle will be the… whole lot of nothing. But don’t fret! You’ll soon realize that writing on Trestle is unlike anything you’ve ever experienced. While strikingly empty in the beginning you can fill the layout with powerful tools we call widgets. These widgets offer distinctive features such as Time, Notes, or Tasks that sort of act like a separate app on their own. You can add, remove, resize, and reposition these widgets anywhere you see fit! Before you know it you’ll have your perfect workspace - whether that’s a word processing powerhouse or a zenlike minimalist writer. And to top it off, you can even customize the design of your new workspace with our lovely Themes.


Prototype 1.0


Prototype 2.0
 
Free and Pro
Trestle will be a free to use app when launched. But wait! There are still incentives to be a backer and support the project right now! The Pro tier offers several benefits such as increased cloud storage, unlimited layout saves, and a customizable grid system. Look at the details below!
 
 Introducing Sheets
Sheets are customizable writing areas in Trestle. They can be resized and repositioned at will and you can even use several of them at the same time. Visually, Sheets incorporate inline toolbars instead of fixed toolbars to minimize graphic cluster and distractions. The design choice help writing on Trestle simple and distraction-free. In addition, we have support for the Markdown syntax and plan on incorporating LaTeX support.
 


Cluster Free Widgets
Trestle implements features into containers called Widgets. Each Widget has a function such as time, notes, or tasks. This reduces unnecessary tools and the complexity of finding features while making tools you need much more accessible in the feature. Need to find a widget you need?

A Dynamic Layout
With our handy Widgets and bare minimum structure, you can easily build layouts that suits your taste or particular task. Trestle’s grid layout will automatically organize your Widgets so that they do not overlap. Save layouts you use often so you can summon a workspace to handle that specific task.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Malha Bly the owner &amp; operator of The Hair Gym®, 6 Sigma Black Belt, Programmer, I.T. Business Analyst, Programmer &amp; Cosmetologist. I have always had a love affair with hair. After years of struggling and many a thousand of dollars spent to find products for my Afro-European daughter's hair, I decided to create my own products.  Her Hair story was such a success I could not keep up with demand. However, the other products were not selling as well and I ended up with spoilage and waste.  That is when I decided there had to be a better way than bulk ordering product and I created The Cosmix &amp; Cosmixology. With the input of cosmetic chemists and other cosmetologists I built and programmed a machine that can take your hair and skin analysis and customize the ideal care for you. This is real customization.!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHY THE COSMIX &amp; COSMIXOLOGY?</strong></p>
<p>Ethnic hair care choices have increased over the years but they are not all-encompassing of the vast diversity that is within the community. Ethnic women contribute over 80% of the revenue in this industry but don't have any say to the ingredients in the products they purchase. This campaign is import to all of us because the day of the cookie cutter is gone. we now have so many textures of hair in the world today that simply taking a hair quiz only puts you in a class but you are in an individual and that matters.  With this system, for the creation of custom hair &amp; skincare products, you are now in control. The FDA only requires producers to disclose a small percentage of what they actually put in the products you use. However, this convenient solution will empower you to reduce waste, save money, &amp; chose what ingredients are right for you.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Due to the minimalistic design of this machine only  $30,000 is needed to get to the first production run.

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Roberto Rosario and I started Mayan EDMS 6 years ago. To my surprise, it has gone beyond anything I had planned for it and anything I could have imaged. New features continue to be added to this day on every release.</p>
<p>There are some features however that no matter how much I want to add, simply can't. The most common reason is that I or any of the contributors, don't know enough about a topic to add them. In this case, it is the lack of knowledge of a computer language that prevents adding a feature.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The purpose of this campaign</h3>
<p>The feature in question is the ability to select ""zones"" in a document so that OCR (Optical Character Recognition) can be performed in them. Mayan EDMS currently offers OCR, but it performed for the entirety of a document. Many users request this feature periodically as it increased exponentially the use of the recognized text of a document.</p>
<p>There are several tiers to solve this and add zone OCR support. The part regarding the backend (Python) code I can manage. The frontend interation to select these zones is the part that is missing.  With zone OCR support, Mayan EDMS will be able to recognize things like invoice numbers much easier. Since this information will be store as part of the document, it can also be used in other parts of the system like the full text search or the indexing system.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The plan</h3>
<p>With your contribution, this campaign aims to raise enough money so that a programmer experienced in the topic of zone OCR, HTML, CSS, and Javascript can be hired to add the remaining front-end piece of the puzzle. Consulting with experienced Javascript developers the most common figure was two days at a rate of $45 USD per hour. This give the total estimate of $720 dollars to hire a developer. The resulting code will be become a part of Mayan EDMS, under the same license of the project, no strings attached.<br/> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Being experienced in the development of Mayan EDMS I will work with the programmer contracted to first define the deliverables of the contract. The major risk for this campaign will be extending over the amount of hours contracted. If this is the case I plan to cover personally a few extra hours if that is all that is needed. In the worst case that the project doesn't get completed, the resulting code will still be made available as a code branch for other to hack on and maybe get it complete.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help with the campaign economically, please just spread the word. Just use the buttons at the campaign and share it on your social media sites.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for helping Mayan EDMS grow and keeping it as free software for everybody!</p>

<b>CRONIOS </b>will gestalten. Jede <b>CRONIOS </b>will anders sein. <i>Du </i>kannst <b>CRONIOS</b> gestalten, Deine <i>eigene </i><b>CRONIOS </b>ist das Ziel.<br/><br/><b>CRONIOS </b>is
designing. Every CRONIOS dreams of being different. You can design <b>CRONIOS</b>, your
own <b>CRONIOS </b>is the objective.<br/><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>CRONIOS </b>hängt an der Wand, liegt auf dem Schreibtisch oder wird von einem Spiegel oder einer anderen Fläche reflektiert. Mit <b>CRONIOS </b>darf man spielen. <b>CRONIOS </b>ist flexibel. <b>CRONIOS </b>spielt mit.<br/><br/><b>CRONIOS </b>may
hang on the wall, lie on the desk or may be reflected by a mirror or another
surface. You can play with <b>CRONIOS</b>. <b>CRONIOS </b>is flexible. <b>CRONIOS </b>will play

<p><b>CRONIOS </b>ist ein Design-Experiment. Unser Chef ist meint, <b>CRONIOS </b>braucht kein Mensch. Aber wir, die Entwickler, Denker und Träumer in unserer Firma, sind überzeugt, <b>CRONIOS </b>ist mehr, <b>CRONIOS </b>muss bekannt gemacht werden. Der Chef sagt ""dann finanziert die Sache und gut ist"".<br/><br/><b>CRONIOS </b>is
a designing experiment. Our boss is convinced that no one needs <b>CRONIOS</b>. But we,
the developers, thinkers and dreamers at our company, think that <b>CRONIOS </b>is
more than that and that awareness of <b>CRONIOS </b>has to be spread. Our boss says
that we may go ahead if the project is properly financed.<br/></p>
<p><b>OK! Das machen wir nun!  Okay, here
we go!<br/></b></p>
<p>Die Herstellung von <b>CRONIOS </b>basiert auf mehreren Hoch-Technologien. <b>CRONIOS'</b> Herz ist ein moderner 32 bit Cortex Controller mit integrierter Echtzeituhr und integrierter USB-Schnittstelle. Die eingesetzte Stütz-Batterie hält etwa 10 Jahre und ist natürlich auswechselbar. <b>CRONIOS </b>kann an einen PC angeschlossen und umfangreich konfiguriert werden. Sommer- und Winterzeit ist für <b>CRONIOS </b>kein Problem, <b>CRONIOS </b>weiss Bescheid, das alles wird automatisch erledigt. Ein PC-basiertes Konfigurationsprogramm ist inklusive. Es ermöglicht Einstellungen zu allen Events in Farbe, Helligkeit und Dauer. Einfach <b>CRONIOS </b>an den PC anschließen, schon kann man nach Herzenslust einstellen. <b>CRONIOS </b>macht Spaß.</p>

manufactured using several sophisticated technologies. <b>CRONIOS</b>'s heart is a
modern 32 bit cortex controller with an integrated real time clock and an integrated
USB interface. The battery life is approximately 10 years and it can be replaced
if depleted. <b>CRONIOS </b>can also be connected to a PC so there are numerous ways
for personalization and configuration. Setting the clock to daylight saving
time (DST) is no problem for <b>CRONIOS </b>because it switches those automatically. A
PC-based configuration program is included as well. Several parameters like
color, brightness, and the duration of effects can be adjusted. Simply attach <b>CRONIOS
</b>to your PC and configure it according to your personal preferences. <b>CRONIOS </b>is
a lot of fun.<br/><p></p>
<p>Eingesetzt werden sehr leuchtstarke, neueste DIGITAL-RGB-LEDs. <i>Jede </i>der 60 LEDs hat einen <i>eigenen </i>digitalen PWM-Controller integriert. Nur so gelingt es überhaupt, dass jede LED in Farbe und Helligkeit völlig unabhängig angesteuert werden kann. <b>CRONIOS </b>ist eben high-tech. Über die USB-Schnittstelle wird die Stromversorgung sichergestellt und auch das Farbprofil konfiguriert.<br/><br/><b>CRONIOS
</b>uses bright state-of-the-art digital RGB LEDs. <i>Everyone </i>of the 60 LEDs comes
with its <i>own </i>digital PWM controller. Hence, every single LED can have a
distinct color and brightness. Its power is provided via the USB interface. In
addition, it can also be used to configure the color profile.<br/></p>

<br/>
<p><b>CRONIOS </b>kann man auch direkt bedienen: Eine aufgesetzte Drehscheibe erkennt, dass Du <b>CRONIOS </b>etwas mitteilen möchtest - entweder ein neues Farbprofil ausprobieren oder nur mal schnell den Kurzzeitwecker für die Kocheier stellen.<br/></p>
<p><b>CRONIOS </b>can
also be configured in a more direct fashion: a rotary disk recognizes that you
want to change <b>CRONIOS</b>’s appearance—you could try a new color profile or simply set
the timer when you cook an egg.<br/></p>
<b>CRONIOS'</b> Elektronik stellen wir selbst her, denn die Berliner Firma DIAMEX ist  etablierter Entwickler und Hersteller elektronischer Komponenten.<br/><br/><p><b>CRONIOS</b>'s electronic
components are manufactured by our own company—because the company DIAMEX from
Berlin is an established developer and manufacturer of electronic components.</p>
<b>CRONIOS</b>' Umhüllung oder Deko-Komponente übernimmt ein fantastischer Werkstoff - ACRYL.<br/><br/><p><b>CRONIOS</b>'s case
is made of a marvelous material—ACRYLIC.</p>ACRYL oder PLEXIGLAS gibt es in unglaublich vielen Varianten und Ausführungen. Allen gemeinsam ist das wunderschöne Ambiente durch knackige Farben - die hochwertige Anmutung einer ACRYL-Installation. <b>CRONIOS </b>ist aus ACRYL. <b>CRONIOS </b>ist stylisch. ACRYL ist schwer. Das beeindruckt wirklich - halte <b>CRONIOS </b>und Du wirst sofort wissen - <b>CRONIOS </b>ist werthaltig!<br/><br/><p>ACRYLIC or PLEXIGLASS
is available in numerous variations. All of them are characterized by a
beautiful ambience because of their bright colors. <b>CRONIOS </b>if made from ACRYLIC.
<b>CRONIOS </b>is stylish. ACRYLIC is heavy. That is really impressive—hold <b>CRONIOS </b>in
your hands and you will realize immediately that <b>CRONIOS </b>is valuable.</p>DIAMEX verfügt über eine ganze Phalanx von ACRYL-Bearbeitungsmaschinen. Mit unseren CO2-Lasern, <b>made in the USA</b>, lassen sich alle Gehäuse- und Designelemente bearbeiten bzw. auf den Hundertstelmillimeter genau herstellen. <br/><br/>DIAMEX has
a whole range of ACRYLIC machine tools at their disposal. Our CO2 lasers can cut
all elements of the case as well as all design elements. They are accurate to
one-hundredth of a millimeter.<br/><br/><b>CRONIOS' </b>Gehäuse ist ein unmittelbares Laserprodukt. Schicht um Schicht höchste Präzision.<br/>
<p><b>CRONIOS </b>ist mehr als ein Prototyp, <b>CRONIOS </b>ist fertig entwickelt. Wer einen <b>CRONIOS</b> haben will, der bekommt auch einen! Egal ob für Wohnzimmer, Küche oder Bad. Oder zum Verschenken - denn Weihnachten steht vor der Tür und <b>CRONIOS </b>wird noch vor Weihnachten geliefert - versprochen!!!!!<br/></p>
<p><b>CRONIOS </b>is
more than a prototype. <b>CRONIOS </b>is a fully developed product. Who would like to
have a <b>CRONIOS </b>will get one! Whether for your living room, kitchen, bathroom, or
as a gift for your loved ones—especially regarding Christmas time is of the essence.<br/></p>
<b>Warum INDIEGOGO ?    Why have we
opted for INDIEGOGO?<br/><br/></b>Ganz einfach: Unser Chef denkt, <b>CRONIOS </b>braucht kein Mensch. Aber er wird überzeugt werden, wenn es Unterstützer gibt - wetten, er knickt ein? Zeigen wir es ihm!<br/>Auch möchten wir noch ein paar nette Features in die Software einarbeiten, einen Kurzzeitwecker, eine Würfelfunktion auf Zufallsbasis, weitere Lichteffekte, die zu bestimmten Zeiten abgerufen werden können. So beispielsweise kann man einen Geburtstag einer lieben Person einprogrammieren und <b>CRONIOS </b>zeigt ein Lichterspiel, als Merker oder auch als kleine Überraschung. Wecker- oder Alarmfunktionen, mit einem Lichteffekt hinterlegt, zeigen oder erinnern an Termine.<br/><br/><p>Frankly,
our boss is convinced that <b>CRONIOS </b>was superfluous. But he will be convinced
when there are supporters—bet that he is going to give in?<br/>We would
also like to add a few nice features to the software: a timer, a function to
play dice with a random generator and more light effects which can be selected
for certain points of time like adding the birthdays of your loved ones so
<b>CRONIOS</b> displays a particular effect then. This function can also act as a
reminder or a surprise. In this case alarm functions can be connected with a
light effect so they remind you of appointments.<br/></p>
<b>CRONIOS' </b>Firmware kann man an einem Computer aktualisieren. Kinderleicht!<br/><br/><b>CRONIOS</b>'s firmware
can be updated using a computer.<br/><br/><p>Also ran an den Speck - denkt an Weihnachten - denkt an Euch selbst - <b>CRONIOS </b>ist ein tolles Teil und ein tolles Geschenk für Eure Lieben!!!</p>
<p></p>
<p>So think of
Christmas, think of your own cozy atmosphere at home—<b>CRONIOS </b>is a great gift for your
loved ones!</p>

Die Uhr, die Spaß macht. Ein Hingucker, ein Lichtmagnet, ein täglicher Helfer, ein Dekoelement. Neueste Technik, neueste Technologien, entwickelt und gebaut in                                   Berlin, Deutschland. Made in Germany.

                                  
                                  



                                  
The clock
that is a lot of fun. An eye-catcher, a daily aid, a decorative piece. State-of-the-art
technology—developed and manufactured in                                     Berlin, Germany. Made in Germany.
CRONIOS basiert auf Pi - kreisrund und in sechzig Segmente unterteilt. Jedes Segment ist von einer Digital-RGB-LED besetzt. So ist es möglich, Sekunden, Minuten und Stunden farblich darzustellen.    CRONIOS is
based on pi—as round as a circle and divided in sixty segments. Every segment comes
with a digital RGB LED. Thus seconds, minutes, and hours can be depicted using
colors.

                                 


                                 

  

CRONIOS will gestalten. Jede CRONIOS will anders sein. Du kannst CRONIOS gestalten, Deine eigene CRONIOS ist das Ziel.CRONIOS is
designing. Every CRONIOS dreams of being different. You can design CRONIOS, your
own CRONIOS is the objective.
CRONIOS hängt an der Wand, liegt auf dem Schreibtisch oder wird von einem Spiegel oder einer anderen Fläche reflektiert. Mit CRONIOS darf man spielen. CRONIOS ist flexibel. CRONIOS spielt mit.CRONIOS may
hang on the wall, lie on the desk or may be reflected by a mirror or another
surface. You can play with CRONIOS. CRONIOS is flexible. CRONIOS will play
along.
CRONIOS ist ein Design-Experiment. Unser Chef ist meint, CRONIOS braucht kein Mensch. Aber wir, die Entwickler, Denker und Träumer in unserer Firma, sind überzeugt, CRONIOS ist mehr, CRONIOS muss bekannt gemacht werden. Der Chef sagt ""dann finanziert die Sache und gut ist"".CRONIOS is
a designing experiment. Our boss is convinced that no one needs CRONIOS. But we,
the developers, thinkers and dreamers at our company, think that CRONIOS is
more than that and that awareness of CRONIOS has to be spread. Our boss says
that we may go ahead if the project is properly financed.
OK! Das machen wir nun!  Okay, here
we go!
Die Herstellung von CRONIOS basiert auf mehreren Hoch-Technologien. CRONIOS' Herz ist ein moderner 32 bit Cortex Controller mit integrierter Echtzeituhr und integrierter USB-Schnittstelle. Die eingesetzte Stütz-Batterie hält etwa 10 Jahre und ist natürlich auswechselbar. CRONIOS kann an einen PC angeschlossen und umfangreich konfiguriert werden. Sommer- und Winterzeit ist für CRONIOS kein Problem, CRONIOS weiss Bescheid, das alles wird automatisch erledigt. Ein PC-basiertes Konfigurationsprogramm ist inklusive. Es ermöglicht Einstellungen zu allen Events in Farbe, Helligkeit und Dauer. Einfach CRONIOS an den PC anschließen, schon kann man nach Herzenslust einstellen. CRONIOS macht Spaß.
CRONIOS is
manufactured using several sophisticated technologies. CRONIOS's heart is a
modern 32 bit cortex controller with an integrated real time clock and an integrated
USB interface. The battery life is approximately 10 years and it can be replaced
if depleted. CRONIOS can also be connected to a PC so there are numerous ways
for personalization and configuration. Setting the clock to daylight saving
time (DST) is no problem for CRONIOS because it switches those automatically. A
PC-based configuration program is included as well. Several parameters like
color, brightness, and the duration of effects can be adjusted. Simply attach CRONIOS
to your PC and configure it according to your personal preferences. CRONIOS is
a lot of fun.
Eingesetzt werden sehr leuchtstarke, neueste DIGITAL-RGB-LEDs. Jede der 60 LEDs hat einen eigenen digitalen PWM-Controller integriert. Nur so gelingt es überhaupt, dass jede LED in Farbe und Helligkeit völlig unabhängig angesteuert werden kann. CRONIOS ist eben high-tech. Über die USB-Schnittstelle wird die Stromversorgung sichergestellt und auch das Farbprofil konfiguriert.CRONIOS
uses bright state-of-the-art digital RGB LEDs. Everyone of the 60 LEDs comes
with its own digital PWM controller. Hence, every single LED can have a
distinct color and brightness. Its power is provided via the USB interface. In
addition, it can also be used to configure the color profile.

   

CRONIOS kann man auch direkt bedienen: Eine aufgesetzte Drehscheibe erkennt, dass Du CRONIOS etwas mitteilen möchtest - entweder ein neues Farbprofil ausprobieren oder nur mal schnell den Kurzzeitwecker für die Kocheier stellen.
CRONIOS can
also be configured in a more direct fashion: a rotary disk recognizes that you
want to change CRONIOS’s appearance—you could try a new color profile or simply set
the timer when you cook an egg.
CRONIOS' Elektronik stellen wir selbst her, denn die Berliner Firma DIAMEX ist  etablierter Entwickler und Hersteller elektronischer Komponenten.CRONIOS's electronic
components are manufactured by our own company—because the company DIAMEX from
Berlin is an established developer and manufacturer of electronic components.
CRONIOS' Umhüllung oder Deko-Komponente übernimmt ein fantastischer Werkstoff - ACRYL.CRONIOS's case
is made of a marvelous material—ACRYLIC.ACRYL oder PLEXIGLAS gibt es in unglaublich vielen Varianten und Ausführungen. Allen gemeinsam ist das wunderschöne Ambiente durch knackige Farben - die hochwertige Anmutung einer ACRYL-Installation. CRONIOS ist aus ACRYL. CRONIOS ist stylisch. ACRYL ist schwer. Das beeindruckt wirklich - halte CRONIOS und Du wirst sofort wissen - CRONIOS ist werthaltig!ACRYLIC or PLEXIGLASS
is available in numerous variations. All of them are characterized by a
beautiful ambience because of their bright colors. CRONIOS if made from ACRYLIC.
CRONIOS is stylish. ACRYLIC is heavy. That is really impressive—hold CRONIOS in
your hands and you will realize immediately that CRONIOS is valuable.DIAMEX verfügt über eine ganze Phalanx von ACRYL-Bearbeitungsmaschinen. Mit unseren CO2-Lasern, made in the USA, lassen sich alle Gehäuse- und Designelemente bearbeiten bzw. auf den Hundertstelmillimeter genau herstellen. DIAMEX has
a whole range of ACRYLIC machine tools at their disposal. Our CO2 lasers can cut
all elements of the case as well as all design elements. They are accurate to
one-hundredth of a millimeter.CRONIOS' Gehäuse ist ein unmittelbares Laserprodukt. Schicht um Schicht höchste Präzision.
CRONIOS ist mehr als ein Prototyp, CRONIOS ist fertig entwickelt. Wer einen CRONIOS haben will, der bekommt auch einen! Egal ob für Wohnzimmer, Küche oder Bad. Oder zum Verschenken - denn Weihnachten steht vor der Tür und CRONIOS wird noch vor Weihnachten geliefert - versprochen!!!!!
CRONIOS is
more than a prototype. CRONIOS is a fully developed product. Who would like to
have a CRONIOS will get one! Whether for your living room, kitchen, bathroom, or
as a gift for your loved ones—especially regarding Christmas time is of the essence.
Warum INDIEGOGO ?    Why have we
opted for INDIEGOGO?Ganz einfach: Unser Chef denkt, CRONIOS braucht kein Mensch. Aber er wird überzeugt werden, wenn es Unterstützer gibt - wetten, er knickt ein? Zeigen wir es ihm!Auch möchten wir noch ein paar nette Features in die Software einarbeiten, einen Kurzzeitwecker, eine Würfelfunktion auf Zufallsbasis, weitere Lichteffekte, die zu bestimmten Zeiten abgerufen werden können. So beispielsweise kann man einen Geburtstag einer lieben Person einprogrammieren und CRONIOS zeigt ein Lichterspiel, als Merker oder auch als kleine Überraschung. Wecker- oder Alarmfunktionen, mit einem Lichteffekt hinterlegt, zeigen oder erinnern an Termine.Frankly,
our boss is convinced that CRONIOS was superfluous. But he will be convinced
when there are supporters—bet that he is going to give in?We would
also like to add a few nice features to the software: a timer, a function to
play dice with a random generator and more light effects which can be selected
for certain points of time like adding the birthdays of your loved ones so
CRONIOS displays a particular effect then. This function can also act as a
reminder or a surprise. In this case alarm functions can be connected with a
light effect so they remind you of appointments.
CRONIOS' Firmware kann man an einem Computer aktualisieren. Kinderleicht!CRONIOS's firmware
can be updated using a computer.Also ran an den Speck - denkt an Weihnachten - denkt an Euch selbst - CRONIOS ist ein tolles Teil und ein tolles Geschenk für Eure Lieben!!!

So think of
Christmas, think of your own cozy atmosphere at home—CRONIOS is a great gift for your
loved ones!

CRONIOS zeigt Euch die Zeit endlich in bunt - was bitte will man mehr? Wir wollen CRONIOS produzieren! Bitte unterstützt uns jetzt - DANKE !!!!!!!!!!!!!

<h3>More successful meetings mean more closed deals.</h3>

<p>When I started my sales career I noticed a direct correlation between the effectiveness of my meetings, and the number of deals I closed. Twenty years later, many reps I train face the same challenges that I faced years ago. </p>
<p><strong>We work so hard to set qualified meetings that even a small increase in effectiveness can have a huge impact on the number of deals we close.</strong></p>
<p>In my search to find a way to hold more effective meetings, I found all kinds of answers. CRM solutions and apps are great providing structure for your deals. The downside to these apps is you can't always have them open during a meeting and having your laptop can be distracting.</p>
<p>As I researched how to make meetings more effective, one thing that struck me was the power of writing things down. This is why every sales rep loves their notebook or journal, why we've seen the rise in trends like bullet journaling, and why I created the Sales Journal.</p>
<p>The Sales Journal combines my 20 years experience selling and training with the power of putting pen to paper. It will help you prepare for your meetings, execute and follow up more effectively.</p>

</h1>ORP1 is a high performance networking router that allows you to run a firewall, IPSec VPN (virtual private network) and a Tor server for your home network. Its easy-to-use web interface will make encrypted and anonymised communications for your entire network easier to set up and manage. Now you don’t need to be a geek to be able to ensure that every device you use at home uses the internet with privacy, whether it’s your home PC, smartphone or tablet.<br/><br/><b>Why is the ORP1 device important?</b> Unlike routers from other security vendors who have been caught helping government surveillance of their customers, the ORP1 hardware and software is open source to provide a system that you can trust - there’s no government-mandated back door for snooping.<br/><br/>ORP1 is a powerful networking platform which is a big step forward from other home networking routers, because its hardware and software is being purpose-built on open source hardware and software for high performance, privacy, and ease of use.<br/><br/><b>Who should use an ORP1?</b> If you’re an infosec geek, a journalist or activist who needs to ensure privacy of your communications, or just someone who wants no-fuss networking in your home which keeps your internet usage private, ORP1 is for you.<br/><br/><br/><h2>Why an Open Router Project?</h2>With growth in Internet speeds and the ongoing revelations that everyday people are having their
    personal information captured, we felt the need for a powerful platform that can be used to encrypt communications and protect our privacy and anonymity. An affordable and trustworthy system didn't seem to be on the market , thus ORP1 - the Open Router Project - was born. We need your help to make this a reality.<br/><br/>Security products are nothing without trust and we feel it is necessary to have a product on the market that is truly open. As such, not only is the ORP1 software to be released with an open source license, we will also be releasing the hardware design.<br/><br/><h2>Why we're crowdfunding the ORP1<br/>
</h2>We have funded the project research &amp; development all the way up to prototype phase. Now we need your help to fund the final development of the prototype and manufacture the final product. Bootstrapping has worked up until now, but it’s meant the development of the ORP1 has been slow. We want to speed up the development so we can get the ORP1 out into the world as soon as possible. Especially since there’s a growing distrust of current security vendors - we want a secure and private alternative on the market ASAP.<br/><br/>Our Indiegogo budget will pay for:<br/><ul>
<li>user interface development</li>
<li>finalising the software</li>
<li>system and compliance testing</li>
<li>industrial design</li>
<li>the first manufacturing run<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">.</span>
</li>
</ul><br/><h2><b><h3>The perks of being an early adopter</h3></b></h2>If you want to be among the first to get your hands on the ORP1, we recommend you buy a Privacy Freak (only 10 available, sorry!) or Early Adopter perk. We expect to ship the ORP1 prototype to Privacy Freaks and Early Adopters in April 2014. Assuming we reach our fundraising goal, we expect to ship the ORP1 to all supporters in May 2014. <br/><br/>If you can't afford an ORP1, but would like to support the project, you can buy a Freedom Lover perk for $25. You will receive a warm glow from having supported an open source project, as well as a discount code to be able to buy an ORP1 at the Indiegogo price of $400 if ordered by 31 July, 2014. <br/><br/>Obviously the faster we reach our fundraising goal, the quicker we can move to the next phase of development, so if you want ORP1 to happen, please pledge today, and share this page with your friends too.<br/><br/><h2>The Specs - Hardware <br/>
</h2><p>With the increase in internet speeds across the world we’ve found it difficult to find affordable devices that can be used to encrypt data on high speed connections. Consumer devices tend to be underpowered while enterprise products are priced out of the reach of most people.  We’ve designed the ORP1 to ensure it is capable of coping with high speed connections while remaining affordable.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/215228/files/20131121173119-ORP1-BlockDiagram.PNG?1385083879"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The ORP1 is powered by a Freescale QorIQ P1010 processor.  The P1010 includes a 32-Bit PowerPC core along with a hardware encryption engine, secure boot functionality, DDR3 interface, three Gigabit Ethernet (GE) ports, and two USB ports. A Gigabit Ethernet switch with 5 external GE ports is connected to one of the P1010’s GE ports.</span><br/></p><p>Backers will receive a unit fitted with an 800MHz P1010 and 512MB of DDR3 SDRAM.  Backers will also receive a copy of the schematics and PCB layout.</p><p>Our performance tests have shown that the system gets line speed routing and firewall performance with almost no impact on the CPU.  IPSec testing has shown full-duplex IPSec performance at 700Mbps, and we are expecting this to be line speed with 15-20% CPU usage by manufacture.</p><p><b>Specifications</b></p><p></p><ul>

<p></p><p></p></div>","In the mediaYou'll see us in The Register, ZDNet, SC Magazine, and IT NewsUpdatesWe've added auto-updates to the software specsCheck our our blog for more technical details and use cases.ORP1 - an Open Router Project
ORP1 is a high performance networking router that allows you to run a firewall, IPSec VPN (virtual private network) and a Tor server for your home network. Its easy-to-use web interface will make encrypted and anonymised communications for your entire network easier to set up and manage. Now you don’t need to be a geek to be able to ensure that every device you use at home uses the internet with privacy, whether it’s your home PC, smartphone or tablet.Why is the ORP1 device important? Unlike routers from other security vendors who have been caught helping government surveillance of their customers, the ORP1 hardware and software is open source to provide a system that you can trust - there’s no government-mandated back door for snooping.ORP1 is a powerful networking platform which is a big step forward from other home networking routers, because its hardware and software is being purpose-built on open source hardware and software for high performance, privacy, and ease of use.Who should use an ORP1? If you’re an infosec geek, a journalist or activist who needs to ensure privacy of your communications, or just someone who wants no-fuss networking in your home which keeps your internet usage private, ORP1 is for you.Why an Open Router Project?With growth in Internet speeds and the ongoing revelations that everyday people are having their
    personal information captured, we felt the need for a powerful platform that can be used to encrypt communications and protect our privacy and anonymity. An affordable and trustworthy system didn't seem to be on the market , thus ORP1 - the Open Router Project - was born. We need your help to make this a reality.Security products are nothing without trust and we feel it is necessary to have a product on the market that is truly open. As such, not only is the ORP1 software to be released with an open source license, we will also be releasing the hardware design.Why we're crowdfunding the ORP1
We have funded the project research & development all the way up to prototype phase. Now we need your help to fund the final development of the prototype and manufacture the final product. Bootstrapping has worked up until now, but it’s meant the development of the ORP1 has been slow. We want to speed up the development so we can get the ORP1 out into the world as soon as possible. Especially since there’s a growing distrust of current security vendors - we want a secure and private alternative on the market ASAP.Our Indiegogo budget will pay for:
user interface development
finalising the software
system and compliance testing
industrial design
the first manufacturing run.

The perks of being an early adopterIf you want to be among the first to get your hands on the ORP1, we recommend you buy a Privacy Freak (only 10 available, sorry!) or Early Adopter perk. We expect to ship the ORP1 prototype to Privacy Freaks and Early Adopters in April 2014. Assuming we reach our fundraising goal, we expect to ship the ORP1 to all supporters in May 2014. If you can't afford an ORP1, but would like to support the project, you can buy a Freedom Lover perk for $25. You will receive a warm glow from having supported an open source project, as well as a discount code to be able to buy an ORP1 at the Indiegogo price of $400 if ordered by 31 July, 2014. Obviously the faster we reach our fundraising goal, the quicker we can move to the next phase of development, so if you want ORP1 to happen, please pledge today, and share this page with your friends too.The Specs - Hardware 
With the increase in internet speeds across the world we’ve found it difficult to find affordable devices that can be used to encrypt data on high speed connections. Consumer devices tend to be underpowered while enterprise products are priced out of the reach of most people.  We’ve designed the ORP1 to ensure it is capable of coping with high speed connections while remaining affordable.The ORP1 is powered by a Freescale QorIQ P1010 processor.  The P1010 includes a 32-Bit PowerPC core along with a hardware encryption engine, secure boot functionality, DDR3 interface, three Gigabit Ethernet (GE) ports, and two USB ports. A Gigabit Ethernet switch with 5 external GE ports is connected to one of the P1010’s GE ports.Backers will receive a unit fitted with an 800MHz P1010 and 512MB of DDR3 SDRAM.  Backers will also receive a copy of the schematics and PCB layout.Our performance tests have shown that the system gets line speed routing and firewall performance with almost no impact on the CPU.  IPSec testing has shown full-duplex IPSec performance at 700Mbps, and we are expecting this to be line speed with 15-20% CPU usage by manufacture.Specifications

After researching all about sit and stand desks, and discovering that all the motorized ones were really expensive, I eventually settled for the manual one from Ikea. You know, the one that you had to manually crank to adjust the height. It was the only desk that fit my budget.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/Db7IGjeiKUFPcGPFWE/source.gif"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>But it wasn’t long before I got tired of using the crank. Manually adjusting the height every time I switched working positions was just too tiring. So I actually found myself sitting all the time.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618379622/njtvqqt5k2cdgwfihtjo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>It was a lightbulb moment for me when I realized I can add a motor to do the work.

And there’s a good reason. Sitting too much, especially while working at a desk job tends to lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which promotes poor health and results in many chronic diseases like obesity, heart attacks, etc...  It’s reported that standing promotes many health benefits that can help mitigate the harms of sitting too much. Some benefits include helping to control blood sugar and blood fat levels, which can lower cholesterol, reduce back pain from poor sitting posture, helping to improve mood and energy levels, and boosting productivity. Research shows that maintaining a sit to stand ratio of 2:1 is optimal for comfort and energy levels, while maintaining good productivity. (<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24157240/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24157240/</a>)</p><p> </p><h2>Super Convenient Controls</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/Qe8oDUSR2yWmSa28I7/source.gif"" src=""""/> </p><p><strong>Automatic Height Adjustment</strong></p><p>We know working from home sometimes means your desk will be shared with other family members, and it will be annoying to adjust it every time through their smartphones.

Make your working environment more organized and comfortable, and also get the health benefits from standing & exercise between sitting. The Adjustabot is the beginning of your work - life balance. Our JourneySince I’ve been working at home a lot more recently, I wanted to add a better desk to make my working environment more pleasant, productive, and comfortable. After researching all about sit and stand desks, and discovering that all the motorized ones were really expensive, I eventually settled for the manual one from Ikea. You know, the one that you had to manually crank to adjust the height. It was the only desk that fit my budget. But it wasn’t long before I got tired of using the crank. Manually adjusting the height every time I switched working positions was just too tiring. So I actually found myself sitting all the time. It was a lightbulb moment for me when I realized I can add a motor to do the work. I used a drill to experiment with different torque and speed to find the ideal motor. Then I created a case with my 3D printer. And was able to turn that troublesome desk into a proper motorized sit and stand desk.   I showed my invention to my friends, who surprisingly weren’t that impressed. They thought it needed additional functions to truly make it great. And with their help, we added a power hub with USB-A and USB-C charging ports with both PD and QC compatibility. It also has a 15 Watt high speed wireless charger. We created a mobile app for more precise control and the ability to save height profiles.The APP also has health alarms, reminding you to stand up every 15 minutes or to take a water break. And my favorite feature of all is the automatic height adjustment. All you have to do is put your phone on the desk, and it will automatically adjust to your height.After adding all these functions, my friends were finally satisfied. We’ve already consulted with sourcing agents and manufacturers. And now all we need is your support. Please back us today and bring Adjustabot to life. Thank you! The Importance of Standing Sit and stand desks have been getting more popular for the past few years. And there’s a good reason. Sitting too much, especially while working at a desk job tends to lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which promotes poor health and results in many chronic diseases like obesity, heart attacks, etc...  It’s reported that standing promotes many health benefits that can help mitigate the harms of sitting too much. Some benefits include helping to control blood sugar and blood fat levels, which can lower cholesterol, reduce back pain from poor sitting posture, helping to improve mood and energy levels, and boosting productivity. Research shows that maintaining a sit to stand ratio of 2:1 is optimal for comfort and energy levels, while maintaining good productivity. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24157240/) Super Convenient Controls Automatic Height AdjustmentWe know working from home sometimes means your desk will be shared with other family members, and it will be annoying to adjust it every time through their smartphones. By placing your own smartphone on the power delivery hub, Adjustabot will automatically detect your height profile you preset on your phone and adjust it accordingly. Mobile App ControlUnlike conventional standing desks, Adjustabot is app-controlled, so you can set your own sitting, standing, moving, exercise modes… to as many as you require. The app allows you to set up the perfect modes for your height, so you don’t have to waste minutes setting the height every time you adjust it. One Touch Lever ControlEven though we live in the smartphone age, not everything needs to be connected. And there are definitely times we won’t have our phones with us. The simple one touch control lets you easily control and adjust the height as you please without additional hardware. Power Delivery Charging HubYour working desk requires a lot of energy - from your smartphone, to your laptop. Normally it requires an extension to provide all the outlets for your gadgets. The power hub in Adjustabot provides different charging outlets for all your needs.High Speed Wireless ChargingQi-certified high-speed wireless charging to charge your smartphone at 15W. Just place your phone and the charging and never have to forget plugging in your phone to charge again. 100W Power DeliveryUSB-A and USB-C charging ports with both PD and QC compatibility. Charging your laptops at full speed and any USB gadget you have. Cable ManagementThe unsung heroes of any great desk setup are the cable management peripherals. Adjustabot includes two stylish desk grommets and a sleek cable management tray for you to organize all your cables and wires. Health RemindersStand up and move reminderHealth experts have long been advising people to stand no less than 15 minutes per hour of sitting in front of your computer (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/15...), but it’s simply annoying to set multiple alarms to remind ourselves to do it.

The Impact


So many people have misguided perception and beliefs of  their life and the world. That all cause
stress. Science proves that The stress cause over 80% of all modern diseases
and illnesses. The stress is the source which we need to heal. Otherwise we
just heal the symptoms in form of cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes and so

Our simple Heal Yourself app makes you understand how the
biology works. Helps you discover where your stress is deep-rooted. You can
start healing yourself quickly in comfortable way.
The world is over chemised. Too many medical drugs is
prescribed to patients. But many times they can heal themselves.

Risks & Challenges

The only risk is that some people will need a personal approach to face and overcome all obstacles on their healing journey. They will understand the science behind and how it all works, but although we tested the prototype the practice may not be so easy for everyone.
The app is just tool to help you, but the miraculous outcomes are up to you. Just installing the app in your smart phone doesn’t make you healthy. The app will guide you on your healing journey, but the actual steps are up to you.

The stress check algorithm has over 90% accuracy. Depends on the quality of your smart phone camera. Especially, the cheaper Android devices may have problem with the accuracy.
Otherwise we are not aware of any other pitfalls to deploy the app on time. If a challenging issue occurs we will keep you posted with everything. But as we mentioned we have 4 years experience in developing mobile apps so we know what such development requires.

<i>Wouldn’t it be great if…you could see which websites each device in your network is visiting?<br/></i><p><i>Wouldn’t it be great if...you could easily control the access to the internet?<br/>Wouldn’t it be great if…you could see on your Smartphone who is using your whole bandwidth?</i><br/></p>
<p>Intermostat is a
small, easy-to-install device for your home or office that allows you to monitor internet traffic, bandwidth, and usage for each device connected to your network. Management of each device can be
administered from a computer, tablet or smartphone.  For parents, this is an easy way to control the internet usage of their family members.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458696551/sfi1azvtux0fi1dnkekz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Intermostat is a hardware
device that connects to a router and passively gathers Internet protocol data
making it accessible to end users.<br/></p>
<br/>
<h3>WHAT DOES INTERMOSTAT DO? <br/>
</h3>
<p>Basically, Intermostat is a smart device which is connected through Ethernet to your router to help controlling the internet access of your Network. With
 this smart gadget, you can easily control  the settings of your 
network. For example, the bandwidth usage.</p>
<p>All administration can be done through the Intermostat-App. Every customer of Intermostat gadget gains free access for downloading the Intermostat-App, which will be offered for iOS and Android. <br/>
</p>
<p>In the following we
explain which functions we want to implement to the Intermostat product. All
pictures shown are mock-ups of the Intermostat-App.</p>
<h4>Devices Connected to Your Router</h4>
<p>With Intermostat you can get the information, which devices are connected to your router, because Intermostat notices all devices which get internet access through your WIFI or LAN. This implies connected devices through your WIFI as well as connected devices through Ethernet.

</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458692041/y3ltafm0ovhffipbtxle.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 365.333px;height: 274px;""/></p>
<br/>
<h4>Monitoring Websites <br/>
</h4>
<p>Intermostat allows you to monitor the websites, which every device has visited. Through tracking the router data and prepare the data, the user gets an overview of the websites visited generally, but you can also drill down to each device and get the specific information.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458691990/cc9sb5nlhat6yparabdx.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 294.255px;height: 522px;""/></p>
<br/>
<h4>Filter / Block Websites</h4>It is not only possible to monitor the websites visited, the administrator(s) can also block websites. This means they can choose websites, which couldn't be reached through the router connected to the Intermostat. Moreover, the websites can be blocked just for specific devices.<br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457547360/hokdkieek6tus3wg9ifx.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 299.496px;height: 532px;""/></p>
<br/>
<h4>Alerts</h4>
<p>The administrator(s) can receive alerts, if a specific website is visited. This can happen through email, text or an alert on the Intermostat-App.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it can be send an alarm, if a particular device exceed a certain bandwidth, e.g. if an online game ( which eats bandwidth) is played.<br/></p>
<h4>Bandwidth Monitoring</h4>
<p>Another useful feature if Intermostat is the monitoring of the bandwidth. Through evaluating data from the router, Intermostat shows the user which device is using most of the bandwidth. The current measures can be brought up or the data can be shown on an hourly, daily, monthly basis.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457547316/cq438gmcfo4sivz3qnbe.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 347.915px;height: 504px;""/></p>
<h4>Bandwidth Throttling</h4>

Wouldn’t it be great if…you could see which websites each device in your network is visiting?Wouldn’t it be great if...you could easily control the access to the internet?Wouldn’t it be great if…you could see on your Smartphone who is using your whole bandwidth?
Intermostat is a
small, easy-to-install device for your home or office that allows you to monitor internet traffic, bandwidth, and usage for each device connected to your network. Management of each device can be
administered from a computer, tablet or smartphone.  For parents, this is an easy way to control the internet usage of their family members.


Intermostat is a hardware
device that connects to a router and passively gathers Internet protocol data
making it accessible to end users.

WHAT DOES INTERMOSTAT DO? 

Basically, Intermostat is a smart device which is connected through Ethernet to your router to help controlling the internet access of your Network. With
 this smart gadget, you can easily control  the settings of your 
network. For example, the bandwidth usage.
All administration can be done through the Intermostat-App. Every customer of Intermostat gadget gains free access for downloading the Intermostat-App, which will be offered for iOS and Android. 

In the following we
explain which functions we want to implement to the Intermostat product. All
pictures shown are mock-ups of the Intermostat-App.
Devices Connected to Your Router
With Intermostat you can get the information, which devices are connected to your router, because Intermostat notices all devices which get internet access through your WIFI or LAN. This implies connected devices through your WIFI as well as connected devices through Ethernet.




Monitoring Websites 

Intermostat allows you to monitor the websites, which every device has visited. Through tracking the router data and prepare the data, the user gets an overview of the websites visited generally, but you can also drill down to each device and get the specific information.



Filter / Block WebsitesIt is not only possible to monitor the websites visited, the administrator(s) can also block websites. This means they can choose websites, which couldn't be reached through the router connected to the Intermostat. Moreover, the websites can be blocked just for specific devices.


Alerts
The administrator(s) can receive alerts, if a specific website is visited. This can happen through email, text or an alert on the Intermostat-App.
Furthermore, it can be send an alarm, if a particular device exceed a certain bandwidth, e.g. if an online game ( which eats bandwidth) is played.
Bandwidth Monitoring
Another useful feature if Intermostat is the monitoring of the bandwidth. Through evaluating data from the router, Intermostat shows the user which device is using most of the bandwidth. The current measures can be brought up or the data can be shown on an hourly, daily, monthly basis.

Bandwidth Throttling
After having seen this data, the user has the opportunity to throttle the bandwidth for each device connected to the router. This can be done through splitting the bandwidth between the devices. As a result, a specific percentage of the total bandwidth can be guaranteed to a specific device. This helps, if you are for example watching an online movie.


Pausing the Internet 

Intermostat allows you to pause the internet for all devices (for example during the night) or you can pause the internet for a particular device in your network.
Comparing Bandwidth Received
If you are wondering how much bandwidth you are getting in total from your Internet Service Provider (ISP), you can get this information with the Intermostat, too. Then you can compare this to the bandwidth promised by your ISP. 

WHAT MAKES INTERMOSTAT UNIQUE?
Intermostat helps you to control the internet usage, which is especially helpful for parents. With our gadget you can see which websites your kids are visiting, block them if necessary or get alerts. Moreover, you can limit their internet usage by throttling the bandwidth or pausing the internet. To control your internet settings and data is not easy with most of the routers. With Intermostat, this problem is solved: You can easily navigate with an app to several settings like the bandwidth usage.

<p>DANDYCAN HEADPHONES is a project that was started two years ago when Daniel Åhman, a Scandinavian product designer, realized that he had bought a new pair of headphones almost once a year for the last twenty years. He thought to himself that it made no sense at all.</p>
<p>So he started pondering over why most of the headphones on the market were so crappy.</p>
<p>The conclusion and insight was that most of the products are made out of plastic and are also poorly designed.</p>
<p>Many headphones have mechanics and mechanisms that are weak and even unnecessary for the user. And besides that (and sometimes because of that) they often look ugly too.</p>
<p>Another thing that he found very annoying is that the cables always break which results in throwing the whole product away. That is not exactly environmentally friendly and feels like a total waste.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/556365/files/20140504122712-animation_headphones2_2.gif?1399231632"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p>
<b></b><p style=""display: inline !important;""><b><b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b>The start</b></p>
<p>So, instead of buying a new pair he decided to start a project with the goal to design durable headphones that would be a much more sustainable alternative to what is currently on the market.</p>
<p>Right from the start he chose to simplify the mechanics and to use materials that would not break.He also focused on solutions in which the whole product would not be disposed of in case of wear and tear. But besides being durable and more sustainable, they also needed to be aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p><b>The Result – Almost indestructible, </b><b>aesthetic</b><b> and sustainable</b></p>
<p>The DANDYCAN headphones are all metal and leather with no breakable mechanics. The design combines modern and retro and has a sleek and classic look. It is made to be easy and simple to change the cable and the ear pads because they are actually the only parts that might eventually wear out. Scandinavian design at its best!</p>

<p>You will reduce your waste and feel better about not throwing crappy things away. You will also have a nice and durable product that you don’t need to replace every year. We also think that you will enjoy their high-quality feel, their acoustics and their design and style.</p>

<p><b>Why are we here to ask for your support?</b></p>
<p>To be able to produce these fine headphones we need to invest in very expensive tooling. We also need to order a minimum quantity of 3000 pieces so that the vendor can assure the quality of the headphones. So, even if you help us get fully funded, we will still need to put money into this project. But you will give us an opportunity to actually make a difference, and you will give us a good start on our mission to make durable products and offer people a sound lifestyle.</p>

<p><b><i>Acoustics</i></b><b></b></p>
<p>We believe that premium acoustics on a premium headphone should be standard. The combination of an
acoustic chamber in aluminium and a high quality 40 mm premium speaker is
probably the best start you can get. We then used an acoustic lab to
tune and trim the sound curves to what we believe are great acoustics. We have achieved excellent acoustics on the mock-up but we will continue to fine tune during the next phase to create the perfect acoustics. The specifications may therefore change (for the better) during the next phase.</p>
<p><b><i>Design</i></b><b></b></p>
<p>We have kept the design
classical, clean and simple. We have added some design features that make them look a little
retro. You could call the design modern retro but most of all we strived to
make them look sleek and dandy.</p>
<p>To summarize the design
process we used emotions as a guide. If they looked good, sounded good, and were comfortable to wear, users would feel happy wearing them.</p>
<p><b><i>Mechanics</i></b><b></b></p>
<p>We wanted to minimize
the mechanisms in these headphones because so often they add something negative to
the design. There was a challenge to make the mechanisms strong enough without
making the headphones too big or lose their comfort. But we could not compromise the height adjustment because people have different head
sizes :-) . We therefore divided the height adjustment between two principals; some
adjustment with an elastic headband and some with a slider. We found just having the slider adjustment would give you the crazy antenna look and just having
the headband adjustment would make you look like an alien if
you have a small head :-) . So the compromise between the principals was the best
practice in this case.</p>
<p><b><i>Ergonomics</i></b><b></b></p>
<p>We have also worked a
lot with the ergonomics of the product. The headphones' tilt is pre-angled to accommodate most peoples actual head size and shape. We have also
chosen the softest and most comfortable protein leathers and memory foams available on market.</p>
<p><b><i>Environmental &amp; Social </i></b><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><i>responsibility</i></b></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We take Mother Nature
seriously. One of the main focus on the Dandycan headphones has been to make them durable so you don't need to consume new headphones all the time. We have also built the headphones to be very easy to disassemble
and with materials that are easy to recycle. We also have a
vision in the future to offer people the possibility to send back
the product so we can reuse parts to build refurbished products and
recycle whats left. We even would like to sell products with these used parts so
that the headphones look used (like an old pair of jeans) but still with new speakers, cable and ear pads. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">We would like to make limited editions to support something we believe would make the world a better place.

PRODUCT INFORMATION
 









IN THIS VIDEO YOU CAN HEAR WHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT THE DANDYCAN HEADPHONES:

MORE ON THE STORY OF DANDYCAN HEADPHONES:

The Background & The Insights
DANDYCAN HEADPHONES is a project that was started two years ago when Daniel Åhman, a Scandinavian product designer, realized that he had bought a new pair of headphones almost once a year for the last twenty years. He thought to himself that it made no sense at all.
So he started pondering over why most of the headphones on the market were so crappy.
The conclusion and insight was that most of the products are made out of plastic and are also poorly designed.
Many headphones have mechanics and mechanisms that are weak and even unnecessary for the user. And besides that (and sometimes because of that) they often look ugly too.
Another thing that he found very annoying is that the cables always break which results in throwing the whole product away. That is not exactly environmentally friendly and feels like a total waste.





The start
So, instead of buying a new pair he decided to start a project with the goal to design durable headphones that would be a much more sustainable alternative to what is currently on the market.
Right from the start he chose to simplify the mechanics and to use materials that would not break.He also focused on solutions in which the whole product would not be disposed of in case of wear and tear. But besides being durable and more sustainable, they also needed to be aesthetically pleasing.
The Result – Almost indestructible, aesthetic and sustainable
The DANDYCAN headphones are all metal and leather with no breakable mechanics. The design combines modern and retro and has a sleek and classic look. It is made to be easy and simple to change the cable and the ear pads because they are actually the only parts that might eventually wear out. Scandinavian design at its best!



Why is this important for you?
You will reduce your waste and feel better about not throwing crappy things away. You will also have a nice and durable product that you don’t need to replace every year. We also think that you will enjoy their high-quality feel, their acoustics and their design and style.

But ultimately you will save a tiny bit of the earth and that should make you feel better.


Why are we here to ask for your support?
To be able to produce these fine headphones we need to invest in very expensive tooling. We also need to order a minimum quantity of 3000 pieces so that the vendor can assure the quality of the headphones. So, even if you help us get fully funded, we will still need to put money into this project. But you will give us an opportunity to actually make a difference, and you will give us a good start on our mission to make durable products and offer people a sound lifestyle.



Are you also tired of crappy products?
We hope that you will fund us by signing up for these dandy headphones. Dandycan headphones are not only beautiful, sleek and stylish but also durable and long-lasting. We want to offer you a sound and sustainable lifestyle and ultimately we will save (a tiny bit of) the earth.



More about the product
Acoustics
We believe that premium acoustics on a premium headphone should be standard. The combination of an
acoustic chamber in aluminium and a high quality 40 mm premium speaker is
probably the best start you can get. We then used an acoustic lab to
tune and trim the sound curves to what we believe are great acoustics. We have achieved excellent acoustics on the mock-up but we will continue to fine tune during the next phase to create the perfect acoustics. The specifications may therefore change (for the better) during the next phase.
Design
We have kept the design
classical, clean and simple. We have added some design features that make them look a little
retro. You could call the design modern retro but most of all we strived to
make them look sleek and dandy.
To summarize the design
process we used emotions as a guide. If they looked good, sounded good, and were comfortable to wear, users would feel happy wearing them.
Mechanics
We wanted to minimize
the mechanisms in these headphones because so often they add something negative to
the design. There was a challenge to make the mechanisms strong enough without
making the headphones too big or lose their comfort. But we could not compromise the height adjustment because people have different head
sizes :-) . We therefore divided the height adjustment between two principals; some
adjustment with an elastic headband and some with a slider. We found just having the slider adjustment would give you the crazy antenna look and just having
the headband adjustment would make you look like an alien if
you have a small head :-) . So the compromise between the principals was the best
practice in this case.
Ergonomics
We have also worked a
lot with the ergonomics of the product. The headphones' tilt is pre-angled to accommodate most peoples actual head size and shape. We have also
chosen the softest and most comfortable protein leathers and memory foams available on market.
Environmental & Social responsibility


We take Mother Nature
seriously. One of the main focus on the Dandycan headphones has been to make them durable so you don't need to consume new headphones all the time. We have also built the headphones to be very easy to disassemble
and with materials that are easy to recycle. We also have a
vision in the future to offer people the possibility to send back
the product so we can reuse parts to build refurbished products and
recycle whats left. We even would like to sell products with these used parts so
that the headphones look used (like an old pair of jeans) but still with new speakers, cable and ear pads. We would like to make limited editions to support something we believe would make the world a better place. Some of the profits from this edition will then be donated to support the cause. 
Time Plan and Risks
Dandycan is a straight forward product and a lot of the work has already been done to reduce any potential risks. We have already visited and collaborated with the sourcing and manufacturing partners. The main risk in this project, would be poor quality from assembly and mechanical suppliers. We’ll reduce this risk by visiting mechanical suppliers and we will be present during product-builds, assembly and testing.

Solve all the problems you may have. Make your time with your dog more harmonious.         The leash handle has a water bowl and water tank that holds 150 ml of water so your pup can quench their thirst anywhere.  Also, the water tank can be easily disassembled. We included a built-in storage area to hold up to 15 waste bags with an easy-tear dispenser. Our waste bag storage is a universal type, you can easily buy refills online.  Built-in Lighting for Nighttime: LED lights in both the leash handle and the dog’s collar keep you  both safe and visible at night. The irradiation distance was 3 meters and 1 meter respectively.   Vibration collars are often suggested for hearing-impaired dogs or those who simply refuse to listen. The primary use of vibration in a dog training collar is to get the dog’s attention or use it as a recall signal. When using vibration training, you want the collar to fit snugly enough for the dog to feel the vibration but not tightly. You should be able to put 1-2 fingers between the collar and your dog's neck. Vibration is a safe and humane way to work with dogs of any size to help train them, praise them, and correct behavior. For sound training mode, Dogs can recognize certain sounds and tones and learn how to react to them. For example, your dog knows what the doorbell ringing means and how to react to it.Through repetition, dogs will learn what a specific sound or tone means and be able to react to it appropriately.  With sound training, you can easily overlay an audible sound over a known (or learning) verbal command and quickly teach your dog commands like ""sit,"" ""stay,"" and ""heel.""Both training modes can be used to give your pup a warning, give them praise, or as a silent command depending on how you choose to train your dog.When using any training tools, experts recommend you use verbal commands first and then training tools to reinforce the commands, and reward positive behavior with treats. Training tools are cues for your dogs - not a consequence or punishment. The GoGoLeash Training System has a maximum range of about 650 feet. For training modes, internal channel switching allows you to switch from one dog to another to easily use their preferred training method only on them.  GoGoLeash’s handle have super bearing capacity up to 100 kg / 220 pounds and you can walk up to 5 dogs with one leash handle.    The GoGoLeash is also compatible with regular car seat belt buckles to keep your dogs safe and secure in your vehicle. Each leash handle is equipped with a safety strap to prevent accidental drop. Our handles are ergonomically designed and easy to hold.   We use 1.3 to 1.5 meters of adjustable reflective rope with universal buckle.   GoGoLeash’s collar is IP65 waterproof and rain resistant so the smart leash and collar system can be used in any weather.   We won the NEW INNOVATIONS IN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS award at CES. After the CES, we upgraded some features, such as size, design, function, etc. through the collected suggestions.                  ●     What shipping service will you be using?●     Most of the rewards we have listed, will use Container shipping to ship to the destination country or city and then use the local post office or shipping services to get the GoGoLeash to your home.

<p>Before we get into the nuts and bolts of it all, here’s the eagle-eye view of our campaign:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1. <strong>The product</strong> is an app that instantly connects sellers with nearby buyers for safe, secure and on-demand transactions using their mobile phones.</p>
<p>2. <strong>We use our own lingo</strong> and refer to our buyers as <strong>Buckaroos</strong> and our sellers as <strong>Buckeneurs.</strong></p>
<p>3. <strong>The sole purpose of our app</strong> is to allow users to have the independence to take back control of their lives and the freedom to choose how they live it. </p>
<p>4. <strong>The bigger goal </strong>is to offer<strong> </strong>an easier way to get the two things in life we all wish we had more of which is Time and Money.”</p>

</h2><p> </p><p>Whilst finding myself unemployed, I looked at the way in which employment, service delivery, and e-commerce operate in our world today.</p><p>Everyone's accustomed to buying products and scheduling services online… the problem is that we don’t have time to browse through endless options, trying to decide which product or service offers the best value for the price. As sellers, we sometimes have to wait days on end to get paid after delivery. </p><p><strong>Frustrated by the ways things were being done and the limitations I faced, I knew there had to be a better way.</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538021277/sd0vhf30cacts3kcxd65.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>I discovered that as sellers, we wanted a secure mobile solution, enabling us to sell our products, provide services or even complete tasks for nearby buyers. Sellers want to earn a kwikbuck and as buyers, we wanted an app that keeps up with a fast-paced life. So instead of waiting for days, weeks and months for our deliveries, we all wanted a solution that conveniently offers us what we want, whenever we needed it. </p><p>I figured that since some of us have the time but not the bucks, while others have the bucks but never the time, my mission was to offer the perfect solution. <strong>I wanted to offer both buyers and sellers something new, innovative, safe and above all, convenient. </strong></p><p>I had my “ah-ha” moment and imagined users simply tapping to earn a buck or conveniently get what they want, whenever they need it. I wanted users to have the independence to take control of their lives, with the freedom to choose how they live it. I decided to combine a product marketplace, service delivery, and tasking solution, into one central on-demand mobile marketplace, <strong>giving users access to the products we loved, combined with the services we needed.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Through this vision, KwikBuck was born...</strong></p><p> </p><h2><strong>Convenience at Your Fingertips</strong></h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537202259/ywzqjcal27ym62gb5tpr.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Kwikbuck is the mobile app that lets you buy and sell products and services all in one place with one account.

Before we get into the nuts and bolts of it all, here’s the eagle-eye view of our campaign:
 
1. The product is an app that instantly connects sellers with nearby buyers for safe, secure and on-demand transactions using their mobile phones.
2. We use our own lingo and refer to our buyers as Buckaroos and our sellers as Buckeneurs.
3. The sole purpose of our app is to allow users to have the independence to take back control of their lives and the freedom to choose how they live it. 
4. The bigger goal is to offer an easier way to get the two things in life we all wish we had more of which is Time and Money.”
And we believe all of this is possible – with a single app and, of course, a whole lot of people.

Our Story
 Whilst finding myself unemployed, I looked at the way in which employment, service delivery, and e-commerce operate in our world today.Everyone's accustomed to buying products and scheduling services online… the problem is that we don’t have time to browse through endless options, trying to decide which product or service offers the best value for the price. As sellers, we sometimes have to wait days on end to get paid after delivery. Frustrated by the ways things were being done and the limitations I faced, I knew there had to be a better way.I discovered that as sellers, we wanted a secure mobile solution, enabling us to sell our products, provide services or even complete tasks for nearby buyers. Sellers want to earn a kwikbuck and as buyers, we wanted an app that keeps up with a fast-paced life. So instead of waiting for days, weeks and months for our deliveries, we all wanted a solution that conveniently offers us what we want, whenever we needed it. I figured that since some of us have the time but not the bucks, while others have the bucks but never the time, my mission was to offer the perfect solution. I wanted to offer both buyers and sellers something new, innovative, safe and above all, convenient. I had my “ah-ha” moment and imagined users simply tapping to earn a buck or conveniently get what they want, whenever they need it. I wanted users to have the independence to take control of their lives, with the freedom to choose how they live it. I decided to combine a product marketplace, service delivery, and tasking solution, into one central on-demand mobile marketplace, giving users access to the products we loved, combined with the services we needed. Through this vision, KwikBuck was born... Convenience at Your Fingertips Kwikbuck is the mobile app that lets you buy and sell products and services all in one place with one account. No more visiting one site to sell, another to buy then yet another to find work. You can do it all easily on Kwikbuck, where Anything is Available On-Demand.The idea was born during a time when founder Jean Pierre ( JP ) was unemployed and looking for the best way to monetize his free time and earn a buck. “ I wanted to create a platform that allowed people to work when they wanted, earn what they needed, buy what they wanted and sell what they didn’t need. I was finding online shopping frustrating, with slow delivery times, spammers and hassles remembering passwords all proving annoying. “So the idea was to create an online marketplace that cut out the hassles and save people time by making it easy to earn or spend a Kwikbuck.In short, the idea behind Kwikbuck is to give people an easier way to get the two things in life we all wish we had more of: Time and Money.”  As Seen OnKwikbuck has already enjoyed exposure on the following channels: How We're Sending a Shockwave Through the World  Our goal is to build an app that becomes the go-to resource for anyone looking to earn or spend a kwikbuck. Our vision is for a marketplace that’s both mobile and social, somewhere that makes buying and selling goods and services locally, quicker and easier than it currently is.   

 
With Kwikbuck, our buckaneurs ( sellers ) get all the freedom and independence they crave by selling their goods, providing their services, or completing tasks. Our buckaroos (buyers) get the benefits of online commerce combined with world-class shopping.
Our platform allows buckaroos (buyers) and buckaneurs ( sellers ) to connect, conveniently and safely transact, sell and buy goods and services, and even get tasks done. It's the app where the gig economy meets a mobile marketplace. A place where passion can be turned into profits.
 
 
The New Form of Social & Mobile Employment

 
Sell goods. Buy services. Buy goods. Sell services. Do one or do them all. That’s the beauty of Kwikbuck. You can make money or spend it on one app you can trust, thanks to its transparent feedback system. 
Need to find a local painter, landscaper or perhaps a perfect locally handcrafted gift? Kwikbuck lets you search local product and service providers quickly using our custom mapping tool. 
You’ll discover who’s offering what in your own backyard. Maybe a neighbour is a wiz at electricals. Or someone a few blocks down the road is producing amazing art. Kwikbuck uncovers the talents of your community and lets you and discover the marketplace around you. You can also sell your products and services to that same community. Simply list what you have to sell and wait for the bucks to roll in.
 

 
By effortlessly combining the products we love with services we needed, our mobile marketplace offers you convenience and peace of mind, so you can gain access to whatever you want, whenever you need it all from one dedicated, innovative and convenient mobile marketplace! 
Kwikbuck will open up whole new markets for your products and services, giving you an easy way to promote yourself so you can earn a Kwikbuck (or three) and up your income.

But we need additional funds to help us offset some of the initial and ongoing costs, as well as to finance additional features and further developments.So, we’ve come to Indiegogo looking for help in raising $9,500.  Here’s a breakdown of our budget:
 $4462 to cover the costs to finalize development of the ""Services"" feature of the app
 $1900 for marketing and advertising of the app
 $1300 to set up our website, emails, and domain hosting for the next 2 years
 $1480 for BETA Testing and Evaluation
 $223 for App Store Fee’s (for 2 Years) and Google Play’s once off fee.
 $135 to cover the total anticipated fees taken by Indiegogo and PayPal for the above amounts.
Any excess funds that we raise will go toward marketing, future feature development and international growth.   Stretch Goals       Here's What's in it For You Well, first and foremost, using the kwikbuck app could help you earn a buck, real kwik.

Throughout the game, you get to hear real stories and statistics about real people, and you have the power to make changes affecting millions.In short, our game teaches players more about the global water scarcity issue, and we are partnering World Vision so profits can be used to fund sustainable water projects in third-world countries.Time is ticking and change is on the way in the form of a game on your smartphone.

<h3>Why this pen?</h3>

<p>The pen is an object that has changed a lot over time. The invention of the ballpoint pen nearly a century ago revolutionized the way we used them, making most of the Sergeant Major fountain pens or nibs that were considered too expensive, less reliable and requiring too much maintenance disappear. Despite all its advantages, a ballpoint pen does not have the smoothness or writing quality of its predecessors. The pen has lost its soul: instead of being our companion, it is an object that we throw away after having emptied its ink. At Olun we are lovers of progress, but we are also looking for elegance and that is why we designed the Pen One. It works with roller cartridges that you can change easily and that contain less viscous ink, allowing you to saturate the paper like a fountain pen while keeping the simplicity of a ball. It is a jewel with a modern style, pure and made with noble materials to resist time.</p>

<h3>Titanium</h3>
<p>Titanium is a very light metal, particularly strong, insensitive to magnetism and resistant to corrosion and heat. It was first used in combat aircraft, missiles and rocket engines. We have chosen this material to make this pen an object you can trust. In its natural state titanium is white but to achieve the elegance we wanted, we also used a black treatment directly in the metal, so you will never have problems with a paint that gets damaged ...because there is none.</p>

<p>To commemorate the launch of the pen, we have chosen to create a limited edition variant. This variant will be made of black titanium only and only 10 copies will be created. Each copy will bear its number in Roman numerals, laser engraved. Thus each pen will be unique and when each unit will have been sold, it will never be possible to buy it again.</p>

<h3>Why crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>Behind Olun there are two old friends: Maxime and Thomas. During a discussion we were thinking about a gift we could give each other to celebrate the success of one of our projects. Maxime's pen was empty so we decided to see if there were some nice premium pens that we could keep all our life to remember this moment. Unfortunately we didn't find what we were looking for, so we decided to create it ourselves. We wanted a pen with a modern design but keeping its soul of yesteryear. The technical challenge being more complicated than we thought, we almost gave up several times but finally we had an idea. Maybe we are not the only ones who want to write without compromise, to believe in something that lasts. By supporting this project you will allow this dissident pen, out of time and out of the system, to exist.</p>

<p>""Gravity Flight Space Adventure"" - a game by Radostin</p>
<p>I was firstly involved in programming when I was ~9 years old. I saw ""the magic"" my aunt and her husband were doing (software engineers). They were writing ""text"" and getting a beautiful and powerful websites and apps as a result. That was unbelievable for me back then. Day over day I was searching Google and Youtube for tutorials on different programming topics. Over time evolved.. Now I can safely describe myself as experienced web and mobile ""developer"".</p>
<p>I've worked with various web technologies based around JavaScript, back-end solutions, mobile development with Java and Kotlin, cross-platform development with Flutter and React Native, game development with Unity and C# and machine learning with Python.</p>
<p>- Radostin Cholakov</p>
<p>The project</p>
<p>There are multiple applications for digital well-being, health, exercise, goals &amp; statistics already in the store. They, however are somewhat too specialized, some are hard to use, and others lack important features. The idea behind Project Chocolate  is the ability of getting powerful insights of what you're doing but with simple to use and beautiful UI. To better understand what actually a user will be able to do with the app let me tell about some use cases:</p>
<p>Encouraging</p>
<p>Let's say you wanna complete a book for 2 weeks. You can just read it and not deal with any apps ;), but in case you decide to do you will be able to create your custom template, enter the amount of pages and the time you wanna complete the book. Then everyday after you read you can log how much you've read, with 2-3 clicks (open app -&gt; enter quantity -&gt; click 'record data'). That's it. The data which is collected over time shows you if you read more or less than you should. It will remind you with notifications if you want when necessary. You can skip the book today because someone invited you to a party, but tomorrow you will read twice as much, right?</p>
<p>You will be able to set minimum value. For example - minimum of 40 pages per day. But yesterday you've read 90 so it won't be ""fatal"" if you skip today ;)</p>
<p>As mentioned above you can do it with 3 clicks, but if you wanna more detailed insights you can get them! The app will include feature called 'Record Types' so you can log not only how many pages you've read but also how much time it took you. Today you've read 30 pages for 30 minutes, tomorrow 35 pages for 50 mins.. You can track your speed over time with beautifully designed diagrams and the app will calculate everything you may possibly wanna track - your average speed, the days you read the most, which book is more boring :) , ect.</p>
<p>Limiting</p>
<p>Now you wanna limit how much time you're spending on your phone, computer and other devices. You will be able to set maximum value - 3 hours a day, for example. The app will include built-in timer. You can let it run while you're playing Fortnite and it will remind you when to stop. If your average time is more than the average maximum we will send you some recommendations on what to do. :)</p>
<p>Tracking progress</p>
<p>You work on a important project - let's see how you're doing. Log how much time you've spent on different tasks, how much money it cost, ect.</p>
<p>Templates</p>
<p>As you see you can use one app for vastly different approaches. That will be possible with custom Topic Templates. Let's say you wanna eat less chocolate. You can log how many grams you've eaten or how many calories consumed, but for simplicity you can add Record Types (as mentioned above) to your template. You frequently eat Snickers. Create a record type for how much grams and calories a Snickers has once and then every time you want to log a Snickers consumption you can just do it with 2 clicks without need to include the quantity of all the units you may possibly wanna keep track of. Over time you create record types for all kinds of deserts. But a friend of yours wanna do the same? Do not worry! You can share your templates with friends so they do not need to recreate all the record types or enter unnecessary template details.</p>

<p>My name is Frank and I'm a masters student at the University of Ottawa. Throughout my studies I've always looked for an ideal solution for taking notes in classes, doodling or just brainstorming different ideas. I loved using pencil because it was erasable but it didn't offer me a visually attractive medium to publish great ideas. I also hated wasting tons of paper when scribbling down temporary notes. Whiteboards were one solution because I could swiftly scribble down colorful diagrams and solve different problems, but they aren`t exactly portable enough to carry everywhere I go.  Thus, I helped design the wipebook ; an erasable notebook that combines the best of both worlds. Unfortunately, wipebooks are really expensive to make in small quantities so I’m hoping to raise enough money to sell them at a reasonable price so others can benefit from them as well. Wipebooks are also reusable, so we could all stop wasting tons of paper! Think about it, it could be the last notebook you ever buy.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Short Summary:
My name is Frank and I'm a masters student at the University of Ottawa. Throughout my studies I've always looked for an ideal solution for taking notes in classes, doodling or just brainstorming different ideas. I loved using pencil because it was erasable but it didn't offer me a visually attractive medium to publish great ideas. I also hated wasting tons of paper when scribbling down temporary notes. Whiteboards were one solution because I could swiftly scribble down colorful diagrams and solve different problems, but they aren`t exactly portable enough to carry everywhere I go.  Thus, I helped design the wipebook ; an erasable notebook that combines the best of both worlds. Unfortunately, wipebooks are really expensive to make in small quantities so I’m hoping to raise enough money to sell them at a reasonable price so others can benefit from them as well. Wipebooks are also reusable, so we could all stop wasting tons of paper! Think about it, it could be the last notebook you ever buy.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>My name is Vaptistis Anogeianakis and I'm a software engineer from Greece. You can see some of my work on <a href=""https://github.com/avnomad"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>By the time I finished high-school I had already written a substantial amount of code in 3 different programming languages and this number proliferated during my university and later years. Yet the more code I wrote, the more it became apparent that the separation of languages into the camp that offers productivity at the expense of performance and the camp that does the opposite, left a huge gap exactly where I wanted to be.</p>
<p>I needed a language that would help me express algorithms in the same terms that I used to learn them and let me delay as many decisions as possible until I have the information to make them. Yet this language should let me optimize my implementation, when I deem it necessary, and in fact help me by collecting the performance data I need to base my decisions on.</p>
<p>For roughly 9 years I worked on this language I now call 'Arcadia' whenever I had the chance, and every time I learned a new programming language, I kept notes on things I could adopt, avoid or improve. Those notes can nowadays be found on <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/avnomad/arcadia-design"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BitBucket</a>. But at some point it became obvious this wasn't a project I could finish in my free time.</p>
<p>So I created this campaign to gather the resources I'd need to bring Arcadia to the programming community, a language that I believe will change the way we write code and our expectations from future programming languages.</p>
<p>As I'll explain later, this campaign roughly corresponds to the first year of development and aims mostly at finishing the core of the design and producing the first parser.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Arcadia</a></h2>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Why Arcadia?</a></h4>
<p>Programming languages are the tools programmers use to create the software that runs your computer, your phone, your washing machine and car. They have a direct impact on the cost and quality of that software. The 'right' programming language can directly improve the experience of those making the software and indirectly that of those that use it.</p>
<p>Arcadia will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be as fast as a systems programming language, but more importantly, help you make informed decisions about performance with automated benchmarks.</li>
<li>Catch errors early, but more importantly, help you gain confidence about software's correctness with unit and property testing.</li>
<li>Allow you to work at a higher abstraction level with mathematical notation and embedded domain-specific languages.</li>
<li>Improve your productivity with powerful reflection and code generation.</li>
<li>Adapt to your needs with extensible syntax and semantics.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've paid much attention to detail, and Arcadia will feature literally hundreds of changes, small and large, to everything from the type system to the <code><span style=""font-family: serif;"">goto</span></code> statement.</p>
<p>For a more thorough answer you can look at:</p>
<ul>

<a href=""https://avnomad.bitbucket.io/Arcadia/crowd-funding%20campaign/part%201/Arcadia%27s%20Unique%20Features.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Some of Arcadia's unique features</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Who is Arcadia for?</a></h4>
<p>Software developers of all kinds. Although the ultimate goal is to improve the quality and reduce the cost of software for end users, those who are going to see an immediate impact in their day-to-day lives are those who build such software.</p>
<p>Arcadia will be a <em>general-purpose</em> language, which means it will be applicable to a variety of application domains.</p>
<p>It will be the <em>best</em> choice for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Performance-critical applications</em> — both <em>high-throughput</em> and <em>low-latency</em>.</li>
<li>
<em>Scientific computing</em> — e.g. <em>numerical analysis</em> and <em>computer simulation</em>.</li>
<li>
<em>Game development</em> — both <em>game engines</em> and the games themselves.</li>
<li>
<em>Desktop applications</em> — e.g. <em>office suites</em>, <em>creative applications</em> and <em>CAD</em>.</li>
<li>
<em>Systems software</em> — e.g. compilers and operating systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, anything that requires high performance and a lot of mathematics will be a good fit. e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Artificial intelligence</em>.</li>
<li>
<em>Image processing</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Arcadia will also be suitable, but perhaps not the best choice for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Web applications</em>.</li>
<li>
<em>Distributed systems</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>It may not be suitable for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>Safety-critical</em> software where <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">formal verification</a> is already in use.</li>
<li>Use as an <em>embeddable language</em>. e.g. like JavaScript in web browsers.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">What's the origin of the name 'Arcadia'?</a></h4>
<p>Arcadia is a wonderful region of Greece where I've spent some quality time, but this is not why I chose the name. The name comes from the Arcadia spaceship of Captain Harlock anime. There, the artist combined features from historical pirate ship, modern battleship, jet fighter and attack helicopter into something that looked consistent and beautiful, not just a bunch of stuff stitched together, and that's exactly what I want to do with Arcadia, drawing ideas from over a dozen languages.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">How would you describe Arcadia in programming language terms?</a></h4>
<p>Arcadia will be a general-purpose, high-level, compiled, statically-typed, high-performance, safe, procedural, class-based, object-oriented, reflective, modular, extensible, concurrent, case-sensitive, free-format programming language with functional influence, compile-time and partial evaluation, limited type inference, dynamic elements, no preprocessor and support for generic, generative, contract and meta programming, unit and property testing and benchmarking.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">What will Arcadia look like?</a></h4>
<p>You can find a brief introduction <a href=""https://avnomad.bitbucket.io/Arcadia/crowd-funding%20campaign/part%201/Introducing%20Arcadia.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">What are Arcadia's principles?</a></h4>
<p>There is a rather long list <a href=""https://avnomad.bitbucket.io/Arcadia/principles/page.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Is there a complete list of features?</a></h4>
<p>No, but there is an <a href=""https://avnomad.bitbucket.io/Arcadia/features%20synopsis/page.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">incomplete</a> one.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Will Arcadia be a ""big"" language?</a></h4>
<p>It depends on your definition of ""big""! :) Ignoring the standard library, C++11 is defined in ~450 pages while C99 in ~200. Arcadia will consist almost entirely of libraries with ideally nothing built-in, but I imagine people will perceive a certain subset as ""the core"" language and I hope to describe that subset in a number of pages closer to the latter than the former.</p>
<p>When it comes to the standard library though, all bets are off! There is too much functionality I want to include and too many unknowns.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Do you consider Arcadia a descendant of some other language?</a></h4>
<p>A few years ago I'd say C++. Nowadays I'm not so sure:</p>
<ul>
<li>C++, or better yet, the techniques used by C++ programmers that led to the development of C++11 and later have been a huge influence.</li>
<li>D was also eye-opening in many ways, including showing me that others are trying to solve some of the same problems and that certain ideas were implementable.</li>
<li>Most of the ideas on extensibility come from Seed7.</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_ML"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SML</a> (and occasionally Haskell) has been my window into the functional world.</li>
<li>Although not a language, <a href=""http://www.boost.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Boost</a> played a significant role as well.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Will Arcadia be statically typed?</a></h4>
<p>Yes. But this might not be the right question to ask in some situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you call an arbitrary function at compile-time, it will fail at compile-time whether you have a static or dynamic type system.</li>
<li>When you incorrectly instantiate a generic function in Java, the experience is a lot different from the one you get in C++, but both languages are statically typed.</li>
</ul>
<p>So a better question is whether the error manifests in the caller or deep in the callee's implementation and Arcadia's answer will be the former.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Will Arcadia use some kind of byte code?</a></h4>
<p>It's too soon to tell, but right now I'm leaning towards compiled modules containing some sort of platform-independent code. That will allow library authors to distribute a single library binary. It will also play better with clients' ability to emit specializations of library functions.</p>
<p><a href=""http://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LLVM IR</a>'s ability to either be executed directly in a JIT compiler or compiled to a standalone executable, makes it look like a good fit.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Campaign</a></h2>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Why a crowdfunding campaign?</a></h4>
<p>I wanted Arcadia to be free (both as in ""freedom"" and in ""free beer""). This looked like a good way to fund the project.</p>
<p>But perhaps more importantly, it didn't make sense for me to create the language just for myself. This is a chance to grow a community early.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Will Arcadia be open source?</a></h4>
<p>Yes. The compiler and related tools will be released under <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GPL 3.0</a> and the standard library under <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LGPL 3.0</a>. Any code I send you in fulfillment of the ""Translate Your Program"" perk will use the <a href=""https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MIT License</a>.</p>
<p>Although I'm not purist when it comes to using proprietary software, it so happens that almost all the work done so far towards creating Arcadia, from collecting notes to writing the campaign pitch and editing the video, was done using free and open source software.</p>
<p>No, the notebooks I used weren't from recycled paper. :-p</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">This seems like a huge undertaking. Why do you think it's feasible?</a></h4>
<p>The industry has decades of experience building compilers and there are good tools and libraries out there to help. Almost every feature has been implemented in some form in some existing language. Others may be new, but straightforward to implement.</p>
<p>There are a few things that don't seem to appear anywhere else and I don't know exactly how they will get implemented (e.g. some parts of the parser and the constraint solver for array lengths). Those are part of the reason I'll prioritize those features and ask only for funding the first year of development: I want to retire those risks before asking for more funding.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Will you hire help?</a></h4>
<p>The goal I set corresponds to one person's salary plus other expenses, but if the goal is exceeded I might be able to hire some help. I'd delegate non-engineering tasks first though, as not much parallelism can be achieved in the first stages of design.</p>
<p>Eventually I'll have to get help both to divide and conquer and for parts where I have no expertise like locales and porting to Mac OS X. But this will be part of a future campaign. Moreover, since this will be open source, there might be independent contributors at some point!</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Why do you think <em>you</em> can do it?</a></h4>
<p>I've never implemented a traditional, textual programming language. Not even a small one as a university assignment. But I've built a standard-compliant C++11 scanner as part of the <a href=""http://www.cppgm.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cppgm</a> certification (sad story really). And I've built a complete 'compiler' for a <a href=""http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci732s1c/archive/2005/lectures/WhatIsVP.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">visual programming environment</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/avnomad/lost-art"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">latter</a> translated a visual representation that resembled a mechanical drawing (but specified a GUI instead of a physical object) to a system of constraints that was solved to ultimately produce C++ &amp; OpenGL code implementing the specified GUI. It used a technique somewhat similar to <a href=""https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5a33/10fc117439c481a0cebcc224645c1f1803de.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this</a>. Although it was largely a proof-of-concept, it incorporated parsers and symbol tables for the various textual parts of the visual language.</p>
<p>Moreover, I've spent years not only using programming languages, but also studying their semantics, understanding their corner cases and implementation methods, reading disassemblies of the code they generate.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I've invested a considerable amount of time over a long period and I'm not going to give up now! I even left my day job because I wanted to see Arcadia and two more projects of mine reach the public. If that doesn't show dedication, I don't know what does!</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">What have you done so far?</a></h4>
<p>So far I've:</p>
<ul>
<li>Written a <a href=""https://bitbucket.org/avnomad/dop-parser/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">prototype of the parser</a> in D. It implements only a subset of the capabilities that are required of the final parser, but fully supports overloading fixity of dynamic operators and juxtaposition with partial support for distfix operators.</li>
<li>Collected all my notes and partial designs from the last 10 years or so, organized them and made them available <a href=""https://avnomad.bitbucket.io/Arcadia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. This was no small task taking almost 2 months and resulting in a document of over 150 pages. I've been updating this document ever since.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from creating this campaign that is. :)</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">How long does it take to create a programming language?</a></h4>
<p>That's a difficult question that usually gets you an answer as concrete as ""years"".</p>
<p>A university assignment for creating a compiler for a Turing-complete language that contains maybe ⅓ the features of Pascal takes a semester, but a practical language takes a lot longer.</p>
<p>Judging from the history of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Clang</a>, <a href=""https://wiki.dlang.org/Language_History_and_Future"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">D</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_%28programming_language%29#History"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rust</a>, I'd say <em>at least</em> 6 years for a contemporary language.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">So why are you asking for only one year's worth of funding?</a></h4>
<p>This is a huge project with many unknowns, so I believe the best way to minimize risks and provide realistic completion estimates is to fund it in stages.</p>
<p>In this first stage the parser will be implemented and the core of the design completed. Assuming everything goes as planned, next year I'll use the completed design to more accurately estimate the resources I'll need to start the implementation. And so on!</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">How will this year be spent?</a></h4>
<p>The following chart should give a rough idea:</p>
<p><img alt=""A pie chart summarizing how the efforts of the first year will be distributed."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://avnomad.bitbucket.io/Arcadia/crowd-funding%20campaign/part%201/Effort%20Distribution%20Chart.svg"" src="""" style=""width: 524px;height: 370px;display: block;margin:auto;"" title=""Effort Distribution Chart""/></p>
<p>Note that this is not meant to be followed to the letter and that tasks will intermix temporally rather than be carried out in sequence.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">What are the deliverables for the year?</a></h4>
<p>By the end of the year that follows successful funding and disbursement by Indiegogo, the following should be ready:</p>
<ul>
<li>A document (most likely PDF) that describes the grammar, syntax and semantics of a large subset of Arcadia. The grammar and syntax may be in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">regular expressions</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EBNF</a> respectively or Arcadia's native way of defining them, which should be complete by then.<p>The subset should contain at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Language:</strong> literals, operators, expressions, statements, types, units of measure, declarations, functions, scopes, closures, exceptions, pattern matching, structures, enumerations, interfaces, imports, exports, initialization and termination sequence, compile-time execution semantics.</li>
<li>
<strong>Library:</strong> boolean, integers, floating-point, complex, character, code unit, array, vector, string, tuple, map, set, pointers, ranges, slices, <a href=""https://avnomad.bitbucket.io/Arcadia/crowd-funding%20campaign/part%201/Arcadia%27s%20Unique%20Features.html#peg-based-dsl-for-io"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DSL for PEGs</a>, streams.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal is not to create a complete and final specification, but one that is sufficient for writing examples, guiding initial implementation and estimating its cost. For example comparing with other libraries to make sure nothing is missing or defining the full complement of math functions might need to be left for a later iteration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A parser (most likely in C++), fully documented and tested and usable both as a library and through a rudimentary <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CLI</a>. In particular it should:</p>
<ul>
<li>have over 90% test coverage.</li>
<li>have over 95% of its functions and classes meaningfully documented.</li>
<li>be accompanied by build and usage instructions.</li>
<li>be accompanied by informal proofs of its termination, absence of memory leaks and computational complexity upper bound (not necessarily tight).</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally it will cover all the features in the table <a href=""#what%27s-so-special-about-parser"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">below</a>, but it should at least cover the features in rows 1–8 and 10–11.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Perk fulfillment will follow the dates mentioned for each perk.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">You often mention the parser. What's so special about it?</a></h4>
<p>Many languages come with an immutable syntax that belongs to a subset of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canonical_LR_parser"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LR(1)</a>, allowing easy construction of their parser by a tool like <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bison</a>. Others have a predefined core that can be extended with new operators under some constraints. Arcadia will join a small family of truly <a href=""https://avnomad.bitbucket.io/Arcadia/crowd-funding%20campaign/part%201/Arcadia%27s%20Unique%20Features.html#extensibility"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">extensible</a> languages.</p>
<p>Even without additional operators, Arcadia's syntax will most likely not be LR(1). Its parser will have to use contextual and type information intelligently to allow even unambiguous programs of ambiguous grammars. And that while keeping computational complexity linear with respect to the length of the input.</p>
<p>Like Arcadia as a whole, its parser will combine features rarely, if ever, seen together. The situation is best conveyed using a table:</p>

<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Why $60,000?</a></h4>
<p>This was perhaps the most difficult decision I had to make while preparing this campaign. What's the minimum amount that would make this possible? There are no manufacturing costs. I can also do most things myself so there is little to be paid on wages. A laptop or a printer would help, but the real resource going into this is my time: a year of it.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, this isn't something I can do in my free time: it has to be a full-time job. Moreover I'll have no other source of income during this period, yet I'll need to sustain myself, pay the bills,... even live a little! :)</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways I could go about pricing a year of my time, but the annual salary at my last job — adjusted for updates in tax law, currency rates and related factors — seemed the least arbitrary.</p>
<p>This proved harder than it sounds. Partly because Greek tax law changes so frequently lately that even tax consultants have trouble keeping up. Partly because there were many options: like creating a company or not. It's also not uncommon for a year's income to be taxed retroactively using next year's updates in tax law, so the following is really a best guess:</p>
<p><img alt=""A pie chart summarizing how the $60,000 funds will be spent."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://avnomad.bitbucket.io/Arcadia/crowd-funding%20campaign/part%201/Money%20Distribution%20Chart.svg"" src="""" style=""width: 640px;height: 387px;margin:auto;"" title=""Money Distribution Chart""/></p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">What happens to the funds raised so far if the funding goal is not met?</a></h4>
<p>This is a ""fixed funding"" campaign so, in the event that the raised amount falls short of the target, Indiegogo will refund all contributions to the backers that made them instead of transferring them to me.</p>
<p>The project, of course, will be canceled and the language won't be finished. No perks will be sent.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">How will the extra funds be used if the funding goal is exceeded?</a></h4>
<p>I have some stretch goals in mind for that case.</p>
<p>Apart from that, more money will mean more people working on the project and/or the same people working for longer. If only the requested amount is raised, the plan is to run a second campaign the next year. If the goal is exceeded by a meaningful amount, I'll delay the second campaign and start working on other parts of the compiler and/or design document immediately after the deliverables for the first year are completed and all perks fulfilled.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Will you be collecting and/or processing any personal information?</a></h4>
<p>Yes and no: with the exception of ""Discuss One-on-One"" and ""All of the Above"" perks, I won't be collecting any personal information directly, but Indiegogo will make some of the information they collect available to me. In particular, I will get access to backers' full names and e-mail addresses. I <em>won't</em> get access to payment information (e.g. credit card numbers), nor shipping addresses (since I won't be shipping anything physical).</p>
<p>The aforementioned names and e-mail addresses will be used exclusively for the purpose of completing this campaign (e.g. sending perks or notifying you of a delay) and I won't share them with 3rd parties, unless absolutely necessary. e.g. I won't sell this information, nor will I send you any advertisements, but there is no practical way I can send you an e-mail without my e-mail provider seeing your e-mail address.</p>
<p>If you have claimed the ""Discuss One-on-One"" or ""All of the Above"" perk, you will be prompted, at some point, to choose a video conferencing application and provide the associated contact information. (e.g. Skype Name for Skype or telephone number for Viber) This information will only be used for the purpose of making the video conference call and won't be collected in a database, nor shared with 3rd parties.</p>
<p>I will make best efforts to keep the above information secure.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Perks</a></h2>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mention in Credits</a></h3>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">What if I don't want my real name to appear in credits?</a></h4>
<p>You will be given the option to select a different name or not appear in credits at all.</p>
<p>In fact, Indiegogo gives you a similar range of options, during checkout, for the name that will be displayed publicly next to your contribution on the campaign page. Consequently I plan to use this choice, if practical, so that you don't have to input the same information twice.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Get the Arcadia Logo, ASCII Art and Mascot</a></h3>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Will the files I get for those perks be covered by a license?</a></h4>
<p>Yes, but I haven't decided on the exact terms yet. It will probably be something more permissive than ""All rights reserved"", but less permissive than a <a href=""https://creativecommons.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Creative Commons</a> license.</p>
<p>The intention is to allow you to print them on a T-shirt that you'll wear in a public place, but not to make them available for download. I don't intend to allow commercial use either.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Include Your Idea</a></h3>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Will the feature I send be actually included in the language?</a></h4>
<p>I can't guarantee that your idea will be made part of the language, or that it will have its original form if it does. I can't even guarantee that the idea will be processed by any specific date, since I don't know what you'll send. But I can guarantee your name and idea is immortalized in the project's page and this should be done by the perk's estimated delivery date. Apart from that, I'll do my best to process ideas and document why they were accepted or rejected.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Can I send my idea before the <em>Estimated Delivery Date</em>?</a></h4>
<p>Yes, but I prefer you wait, in case I need you to send it using a particular format or medium. (e.g. input in a web form instead of an e-mail)</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Why would I pay to send you my idea?</a></h4>
<p>If you decide to back the project, I assume it's because I've convinced you that humanity will benefit from the creation of this language. The perks you choose will be an added bonus.</p>
<p>This perk comes from past experience discussing Arcadia with other people. The way people engage with the project is by suggesting I look at or include, or by asking if I'll include XY feature from ZW language. And although this interaction is invaluable, it also takes a lot of time to research each one of those features and even more to understand how they interact with what I have already planned.</p>
<p>Although completely original ideas are possible and very welcome, this is what I had in mind when adding the perk.</p>
<p>So by buying this perk you support the project twofold, both by mentioning something I might not have thought of otherwise and by funding the time it will take me to process it.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">What if the feature I want to be included is covered by a patent?</a></h4>
<p>Please avoid naming a patented feature. If you do name one, please clearly state the fact that it's patented. Your name and proposition will be noted, but the feature won't be included in the language.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Discuss One-on-One</a></h3>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Which application will be used for the video conference?</a></h4>
<p>Your choice among Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, Discord and Facebook Messenger. If you really want to use something else, name it and I'll see what I can do.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">When and how will I choose the video conference application?</a></h4>
<p>Near the perk fulfillment date, you'll receive an e-mail prompting you to choose a video conferencing application and provide the corresponding contact information.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">When will the video call take place?</a></h4>
<p>I expect to start the process near the <em>Estimated Delivery Date</em>. First you'll get an e-mail initiating negotiations for a mutually convenient date and time. Differing time zones might be a source of difficulty, but hopefully all calls will be scheduled and carried out within the specified month.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Translate Your Program</a></h3>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">In what language should my snippet be?</a></h4>
<p>Any one of C, C++, C++/CLI, Java, Javascript, D, Pascal, AWK, GLSL and Standard ML should be fine as long as you stick to the standard language and library. MATLAB, Visual Basic and Prolog should also be fine as long as you don't use advanced features or unusual parts of the library. I might be able to get back to you for some OpenCL C, C#, Python, Perl and Bash programs too. In any case, send your snippet and if I can't make sense of it, we can negotiate a different language or snippet.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">What are good examples of snippets to send?</a></h4>
<p>Something self-contained and with a clear purpose that exposes a certain set of features. It can be an algorithm or data structure, a function or type definition, a meta-program or test case. It can be complete or a mock-up. Ideally it will be something I hadn't thought of!</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">When will I receive the translation of my snippet?</a></h4>
<p>That depends on when I'll receive the source snippet and how complicated the snippet will be. I expect to be ready to start translating near the <em>Estimated Delivery Date</em> and you'll be notified through Indiegogo and/or e-mail when I am. Assuming you will send your snippet timely, you'll have your translation soon after.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Can I send my snippet before the <em>Estimated Delivery Date</em>?</a></h4>
<p>Yes, but I won't get back to you before the <em>Estimated Delivery Date</em>.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Present Design and Parser</a></h3>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">Which application will be used for the video conference?</a></h4>
<p>Your choice, as for the <a href=""#select-video-conference-application"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Discuss One-on-One</a> perk.</p>
<h4><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">When and how will I choose the video conference application?</a></h4>

</div></div>","Introduction
My name is Vaptistis Anogeianakis and I'm a software engineer from Greece. You can see some of my work on GitHub.
By the time I finished high-school I had already written a substantial amount of code in 3 different programming languages and this number proliferated during my university and later years. Yet the more code I wrote, the more it became apparent that the separation of languages into the camp that offers productivity at the expense of performance and the camp that does the opposite, left a huge gap exactly where I wanted to be.
I needed a language that would help me express algorithms in the same terms that I used to learn them and let me delay as many decisions as possible until I have the information to make them. Yet this language should let me optimize my implementation, when I deem it necessary, and in fact help me by collecting the performance data I need to base my decisions on.
For roughly 9 years I worked on this language I now call 'Arcadia' whenever I had the chance, and every time I learned a new programming language, I kept notes on things I could adopt, avoid or improve. Those notes can nowadays be found on BitBucket. But at some point it became obvious this wasn't a project I could finish in my free time.
So I created this campaign to gather the resources I'd need to bring Arcadia to the programming community, a language that I believe will change the way we write code and our expectations from future programming languages.
As I'll explain later, this campaign roughly corresponds to the first year of development and aims mostly at finishing the core of the design and producing the first parser.
Arcadia
Why Arcadia?
Programming languages are the tools programmers use to create the software that runs your computer, your phone, your washing machine and car. They have a direct impact on the cost and quality of that software. The 'right' programming language can directly improve the experience of those making the software and indirectly that of those that use it.
Arcadia will:

Be as fast as a systems programming language, but more importantly, help you make informed decisions about performance with automated benchmarks.
Catch errors early, but more importantly, help you gain confidence about software's correctness with unit and property testing.
Allow you to work at a higher abstraction level with mathematical notation and embedded domain-specific languages.
Improve your productivity with powerful reflection and code generation.
Adapt to your needs with extensible syntax and semantics.

I've paid much attention to detail, and Arcadia will feature literally hundreds of changes, small and large, to everything from the type system to the goto statement.
For a more thorough answer you can look at:


Some features adopted from contemporary languages and how they differ.

Some of Arcadia's unique features.

Who is Arcadia for?
Software developers of all kinds. Although the ultimate goal is to improve the quality and reduce the cost of software for end users, those who are going to see an immediate impact in their day-to-day lives are those who build such software.
Arcadia will be a general-purpose language, which means it will be applicable to a variety of application domains.
It will be the best choice for:


Performance-critical applications — both high-throughput and low-latency.

Scientific computing — e.g. numerical analysis and computer simulation.

Game development — both game engines and the games themselves.

Desktop applications — e.g. office suites, creative applications and CAD.

Systems software — e.g. compilers and operating systems.

However, anything that requires high performance and a lot of mathematics will be a good fit. e.g.:


Artificial intelligence.

Image processing.

Arcadia will also be suitable, but perhaps not the best choice for:


Web applications.

Distributed systems.

It may not be suitable for:


Safety-critical software where formal verification is already in use.
Use as an embeddable language. e.g. like JavaScript in web browsers.

What's the origin of the name 'Arcadia'?
Arcadia is a wonderful region of Greece where I've spent some quality time, but this is not why I chose the name. The name comes from the Arcadia spaceship of Captain Harlock anime. There, the artist combined features from historical pirate ship, modern battleship, jet fighter and attack helicopter into something that looked consistent and beautiful, not just a bunch of stuff stitched together, and that's exactly what I want to do with Arcadia, drawing ideas from over a dozen languages.
How would you describe Arcadia in programming language terms?
Arcadia will be a general-purpose, high-level, compiled, statically-typed, high-performance, safe, procedural, class-based, object-oriented, reflective, modular, extensible, concurrent, case-sensitive, free-format programming language with functional influence, compile-time and partial evaluation, limited type inference, dynamic elements, no preprocessor and support for generic, generative, contract and meta programming, unit and property testing and benchmarking.
What will Arcadia look like?
You can find a brief introduction here.
What are Arcadia's principles?
There is a rather long list here.
Is there a complete list of features?
No, but there is an incomplete one.
Will Arcadia be a ""big"" language?
It depends on your definition of ""big""! :) Ignoring the standard library, C++11 is defined in ~450 pages while C99 in ~200. Arcadia will consist almost entirely of libraries with ideally nothing built-in, but I imagine people will perceive a certain subset as ""the core"" language and I hope to describe that subset in a number of pages closer to the latter than the former.
When it comes to the standard library though, all bets are off! There is too much functionality I want to include and too many unknowns.
Do you consider Arcadia a descendant of some other language?
A few years ago I'd say C++. Nowadays I'm not so sure:

C++, or better yet, the techniques used by C++ programmers that led to the development of C++11 and later have been a huge influence.
D was also eye-opening in many ways, including showing me that others are trying to solve some of the same problems and that certain ideas were implementable.
Most of the ideas on extensibility come from Seed7.

SML (and occasionally Haskell) has been my window into the functional world.
Although not a language, Boost played a significant role as well.

Will Arcadia be statically typed?
Yes. But this might not be the right question to ask in some situations:

If you call an arbitrary function at compile-time, it will fail at compile-time whether you have a static or dynamic type system.
When you incorrectly instantiate a generic function in Java, the experience is a lot different from the one you get in C++, but both languages are statically typed.

So a better question is whether the error manifests in the caller or deep in the callee's implementation and Arcadia's answer will be the former.
Will Arcadia use some kind of byte code?
It's too soon to tell, but right now I'm leaning towards compiled modules containing some sort of platform-independent code. That will allow library authors to distribute a single library binary. It will also play better with clients' ability to emit specializations of library functions.
LLVM IR's ability to either be executed directly in a JIT compiler or compiled to a standalone executable, makes it look like a good fit.
Campaign
Why a crowdfunding campaign?
I wanted Arcadia to be free (both as in ""freedom"" and in ""free beer""). This looked like a good way to fund the project.
But perhaps more importantly, it didn't make sense for me to create the language just for myself. This is a chance to grow a community early.
Will Arcadia be open source?
Yes. The compiler and related tools will be released under GPL 3.0 and the standard library under LGPL 3.0. Any code I send you in fulfillment of the ""Translate Your Program"" perk will use the MIT License.
Although I'm not purist when it comes to using proprietary software, it so happens that almost all the work done so far towards creating Arcadia, from collecting notes to writing the campaign pitch and editing the video, was done using free and open source software.
No, the notebooks I used weren't from recycled paper. :-p
This seems like a huge undertaking. Why do you think it's feasible?
The industry has decades of experience building compilers and there are good tools and libraries out there to help. Almost every feature has been implemented in some form in some existing language. Others may be new, but straightforward to implement.
There are a few things that don't seem to appear anywhere else and I don't know exactly how they will get implemented (e.g. some parts of the parser and the constraint solver for array lengths). Those are part of the reason I'll prioritize those features and ask only for funding the first year of development: I want to retire those risks before asking for more funding.
Will you hire help?
The goal I set corresponds to one person's salary plus other expenses, but if the goal is exceeded I might be able to hire some help. I'd delegate non-engineering tasks first though, as not much parallelism can be achieved in the first stages of design.
Eventually I'll have to get help both to divide and conquer and for parts where I have no expertise like locales and porting to Mac OS X. But this will be part of a future campaign. Moreover, since this will be open source, there might be independent contributors at some point!
Why do you think you can do it?
I've never implemented a traditional, textual programming language. Not even a small one as a university assignment. But I've built a standard-compliant C++11 scanner as part of the cppgm certification (sad story really). And I've built a complete 'compiler' for a visual programming environment.
The latter translated a visual representation that resembled a mechanical drawing (but specified a GUI instead of a physical object) to a system of constraints that was solved to ultimately produce C++ & OpenGL code implementing the specified GUI. It used a technique somewhat similar to this. Although it was largely a proof-of-concept, it incorporated parsers and symbol tables for the various textual parts of the visual language.
Moreover, I've spent years not only using programming languages, but also studying their semantics, understanding their corner cases and implementation methods, reading disassemblies of the code they generate.
Last but not least, I've invested a considerable amount of time over a long period and I'm not going to give up now! I even left my day job because I wanted to see Arcadia and two more projects of mine reach the public. If that doesn't show dedication, I don't know what does!
What have you done so far?
So far I've:

Written a prototype of the parser in D. It implements only a subset of the capabilities that are required of the final parser, but fully supports overloading fixity of dynamic operators and juxtaposition with partial support for distfix operators.
Collected all my notes and partial designs from the last 10 years or so, organized them and made them available here. This was no small task taking almost 2 months and resulting in a document of over 150 pages. I've been updating this document ever since.

Apart from creating this campaign that is. :)
How long does it take to create a programming language?
That's a difficult question that usually gets you an answer as concrete as ""years"".
A university assignment for creating a compiler for a Turing-complete language that contains maybe ⅓ the features of Pascal takes a semester, but a practical language takes a lot longer.
Judging from the history of Clang, D and Rust, I'd say at least 6 years for a contemporary language.
So why are you asking for only one year's worth of funding?
This is a huge project with many unknowns, so I believe the best way to minimize risks and provide realistic completion estimates is to fund it in stages.
In this first stage the parser will be implemented and the core of the design completed. Assuming everything goes as planned, next year I'll use the completed design to more accurately estimate the resources I'll need to start the implementation. And so on!
How will this year be spent?
The following chart should give a rough idea:

Note that this is not meant to be followed to the letter and that tasks will intermix temporally rather than be carried out in sequence.
What are the deliverables for the year?
By the end of the year that follows successful funding and disbursement by Indiegogo, the following should be ready:

A document (most likely PDF) that describes the grammar, syntax and semantics of a large subset of Arcadia. The grammar and syntax may be in regular expressions and EBNF respectively or Arcadia's native way of defining them, which should be complete by then.The subset should contain at least the following:


Language: literals, operators, expressions, statements, types, units of measure, declarations, functions, scopes, closures, exceptions, pattern matching, structures, enumerations, interfaces, imports, exports, initialization and termination sequence, compile-time execution semantics.

Library: boolean, integers, floating-point, complex, character, code unit, array, vector, string, tuple, map, set, pointers, ranges, slices, DSL for PEGs, streams.

The goal is not to create a complete and final specification, but one that is sufficient for writing examples, guiding initial implementation and estimating its cost. For example comparing with other libraries to make sure nothing is missing or defining the full complement of math functions might need to be left for a later iteration.


A parser (most likely in C++), fully documented and tested and usable both as a library and through a rudimentary CLI. In particular it should:

have over 90% test coverage.
have over 95% of its functions and classes meaningfully documented.
be accompanied by build and usage instructions.
be accompanied by informal proofs of its termination, absence of memory leaks and computational complexity upper bound (not necessarily tight).

Ideally it will cover all the features in the table below, but it should at least cover the features in rows 1–8 and 10–11.


Perk fulfillment will follow the dates mentioned for each perk.
You often mention the parser. What's so special about it?
Many languages come with an immutable syntax that belongs to a subset of LR(1), allowing easy construction of their parser by a tool like Bison. Others have a predefined core that can be extended with new operators under some constraints. Arcadia will join a small family of truly extensible languages.
Even without additional operators, Arcadia's syntax will most likely not be LR(1). Its parser will have to use contextual and type information intelligently to allow even unambiguous programs of ambiguous grammars. And that while keeping computational complexity linear with respect to the length of the input.
Like Arcadia as a whole, its parser will combine features rarely, if ever, seen together. The situation is best conveyed using a table:

1
Only forwards member names not found in class or struct to a special template function.


2
Postfix is not supported. Prefix can be simulated by omitting the parenthesis in function call.


3
Pre/in/postfix operators can loose their status. Other constructs like lists can't be changed.


4
An operator name can't be infix and postfix at the same time. SWI Prolog doesn't support it at all, while YAP Prolog only supports simple cases. This claims it's prohibited by the ISO standard.


5
Fortress doesn't as much allow 'defining' new operators as 'assigning meaning' to operators from a large but fixed set. Properties like precedence and associativity are predefined.


6
There are some restrictions. Most notably there can't be whitespace between postfix operators and their operands.


7
Bracketing operators are supported, but other constructs like if-then-else are not.


8
An operator name can't be infix and postfix at the same time. This is based on the reference implementation. I have found no documentation of the limitation.


Why $60,000?
This was perhaps the most difficult decision I had to make while preparing this campaign. What's the minimum amount that would make this possible? There are no manufacturing costs. I can also do most things myself so there is little to be paid on wages. A laptop or a printer would help, but the real resource going into this is my time: a year of it.
As I mentioned earlier, this isn't something I can do in my free time: it has to be a full-time job. Moreover I'll have no other source of income during this period, yet I'll need to sustain myself, pay the bills,... even live a little! :)
There are a lot of ways I could go about pricing a year of my time, but the annual salary at my last job — adjusted for updates in tax law, currency rates and related factors — seemed the least arbitrary.
This proved harder than it sounds. Partly because Greek tax law changes so frequently lately that even tax consultants have trouble keeping up. Partly because there were many options: like creating a company or not. It's also not uncommon for a year's income to be taxed retroactively using next year's updates in tax law, so the following is really a best guess:

What happens to the funds raised so far if the funding goal is not met?
This is a ""fixed funding"" campaign so, in the event that the raised amount falls short of the target, Indiegogo will refund all contributions to the backers that made them instead of transferring them to me.
The project, of course, will be canceled and the language won't be finished. No perks will be sent.
How will the extra funds be used if the funding goal is exceeded?
I have some stretch goals in mind for that case.
Apart from that, more money will mean more people working on the project and/or the same people working for longer. If only the requested amount is raised, the plan is to run a second campaign the next year. If the goal is exceeded by a meaningful amount, I'll delay the second campaign and start working on other parts of the compiler and/or design document immediately after the deliverables for the first year are completed and all perks fulfilled.
Will you be collecting and/or processing any personal information?
Yes and no: with the exception of ""Discuss One-on-One"" and ""All of the Above"" perks, I won't be collecting any personal information directly, but Indiegogo will make some of the information they collect available to me. In particular, I will get access to backers' full names and e-mail addresses. I won't get access to payment information (e.g. credit card numbers), nor shipping addresses (since I won't be shipping anything physical).
The aforementioned names and e-mail addresses will be used exclusively for the purpose of completing this campaign (e.g. sending perks or notifying you of a delay) and I won't share them with 3rd parties, unless absolutely necessary. e.g. I won't sell this information, nor will I send you any advertisements, but there is no practical way I can send you an e-mail without my e-mail provider seeing your e-mail address.
If you have claimed the ""Discuss One-on-One"" or ""All of the Above"" perk, you will be prompted, at some point, to choose a video conferencing application and provide the associated contact information. (e.g. Skype Name for Skype or telephone number for Viber) This information will only be used for the purpose of making the video conference call and won't be collected in a database, nor shared with 3rd parties.
I will make best efforts to keep the above information secure.
Perks
Mention in Credits
What if I don't want my real name to appear in credits?
You will be given the option to select a different name or not appear in credits at all.
In fact, Indiegogo gives you a similar range of options, during checkout, for the name that will be displayed publicly next to your contribution on the campaign page. Consequently I plan to use this choice, if practical, so that you don't have to input the same information twice.
Get the Arcadia Logo, ASCII Art and Mascot
Will the files I get for those perks be covered by a license?
Yes, but I haven't decided on the exact terms yet. It will probably be something more permissive than ""All rights reserved"", but less permissive than a Creative Commons license.
The intention is to allow you to print them on a T-shirt that you'll wear in a public place, but not to make them available for download. I don't intend to allow commercial use either.
Include Your Idea
Will the feature I send be actually included in the language?
I can't guarantee that your idea will be made part of the language, or that it will have its original form if it does. I can't even guarantee that the idea will be processed by any specific date, since I don't know what you'll send. But I can guarantee your name and idea is immortalized in the project's page and this should be done by the perk's estimated delivery date. Apart from that, I'll do my best to process ideas and document why they were accepted or rejected.
Can I send my idea before the Estimated Delivery Date?
Yes, but I prefer you wait, in case I need you to send it using a particular format or medium. (e.g. input in a web form instead of an e-mail)
Why would I pay to send you my idea?
If you decide to back the project, I assume it's because I've convinced you that humanity will benefit from the creation of this language. The perks you choose will be an added bonus.
This perk comes from past experience discussing Arcadia with other people. The way people engage with the project is by suggesting I look at or include, or by asking if I'll include XY feature from ZW language. And although this interaction is invaluable, it also takes a lot of time to research each one of those features and even more to understand how they interact with what I have already planned.
Although completely original ideas are possible and very welcome, this is what I had in mind when adding the perk.
So by buying this perk you support the project twofold, both by mentioning something I might not have thought of otherwise and by funding the time it will take me to process it.
What if the feature I want to be included is covered by a patent?
Please avoid naming a patented feature. If you do name one, please clearly state the fact that it's patented. Your name and proposition will be noted, but the feature won't be included in the language.
Discuss One-on-One
Which application will be used for the video conference?
Your choice among Skype, Viber, WhatsApp, Discord and Facebook Messenger. If you really want to use something else, name it and I'll see what I can do.
When and how will I choose the video conference application?
Near the perk fulfillment date, you'll receive an e-mail prompting you to choose a video conferencing application and provide the corresponding contact information.
When will the video call take place?
I expect to start the process near the Estimated Delivery Date. First you'll get an e-mail initiating negotiations for a mutually convenient date and time. Differing time zones might be a source of difficulty, but hopefully all calls will be scheduled and carried out within the specified month.
Translate Your Program
In what language should my snippet be?
Any one of C, C++, C++/CLI, Java, Javascript, D, Pascal, AWK, GLSL and Standard ML should be fine as long as you stick to the standard language and library. MATLAB, Visual Basic and Prolog should also be fine as long as you don't use advanced features or unusual parts of the library. I might be able to get back to you for some OpenCL C, C#, Python, Perl and Bash programs too. In any case, send your snippet and if I can't make sense of it, we can negotiate a different language or snippet.
What are good examples of snippets to send?
Something self-contained and with a clear purpose that exposes a certain set of features. It can be an algorithm or data structure, a function or type definition, a meta-program or test case. It can be complete or a mock-up. Ideally it will be something I hadn't thought of!
When will I receive the translation of my snippet?
That depends on when I'll receive the source snippet and how complicated the snippet will be. I expect to be ready to start translating near the Estimated Delivery Date and you'll be notified through Indiegogo and/or e-mail when I am. Assuming you will send your snippet timely, you'll have your translation soon after.
Can I send my snippet before the Estimated Delivery Date?
Yes, but I won't get back to you before the Estimated Delivery Date.
Present Design and Parser
Which application will be used for the video conference?
Your choice, as for the Discuss One-on-One perk.
When and how will I choose the video conference application?
The process will be the same as for the Discuss One-on-One perk.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">            Eating well-portioned meals offers many health benefits for everyone, <br/>including your pet. The problem is, your pet has no understanding of this. Eating as much as they like, whenever they like is what your naughty friend would love to do, but this could make him fat or even ill. That is why it is so important that their nutrition and the timing of feedings is carefully controlled.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">           You’d like to just pick one of your pet’s favorites and feed them a measured amount, punctually, two or three times a day, but doing this regularly is not easy. You might even consider asking someone to give you a hand. With the Pet Butler, you can load your pet’s favorite food.  One of the most popular choices is dried kibble, because it has numerous nutritional benefits and is convenient.</p>
<p>So without further ado, please let us introduce you to The Pet Butler!</p>

<p>       Feeding your pet well is already difficult enough.  You have to watch their nutrition, you have to watch how often they’re fed, and no two pets are quite the same.  Then, of course, some pets are mischievous, destructive, and curious, and nothing ruins a diet like a clever pet. </p>        The most important thing is that you shouldn’t have to worry about your pet whether you’re home or away.  Let the Pet Butler serve your pet and help  you.<br/><br/>

<p>            Many pet parents have had the experience of worrying about whether or not they remembered to feed their pet companion, and that is precisely where the Pet Butler’s story began.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">            A few years ago, Phiphi and Sa took a trip to Japan. They left their cats (Hunsa, Jimmy, Tam and Jaaw) with their neighbors during their ten days holiday, but they just couldn’t feel comfortable.  They felt like they were imposing on their neighbors and worried that their cats might not be fed the right quantity on time. When they returned and found, to their relief, that their pets were fine, they decided they didn't want to experience that kind of anxiety again, so together, they invented the world’s first Pet Butler to take care of the pets’ dietary needs for all pet lovers around the world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">           The very first prototype of the Pet Butler was called The Holidays Pet Manager, and with it, Phiphi and Sa won the first place award from the 2013 2nd ICT International Student Conference’s Software Innovation Contest in the category of Multimedia and Embedded systems. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">           There are many reasons why we are here at IndieGoGo. First, we believe that all pets deserve to live longer lives with good nutrition and weight management.  Young animals depend on excellent nutrition to reach their maximum growth potential and energy.  Adult animals need excellent nutrition to keep their energy levels high enough for healthy amounts of play and to prevent illness.  Elderly animals need excellent nutrition to live as long as possible, keeping a manageable amount of weight on their aging joints. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Owners around the world love their pet as a part of their family. We know that pet owners want to provide not only the basic necessities of life but also happiness and health. That is why we decided to leave everything behind and put all our efforts into making the pet butler a reality. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">         All money from contributors will be used for Pet Butler mass production (mold and electronic set up). Finding venture capitalists is also a part of the plan, but we want to help the whole worldwide community of pet lovers to participate and make independent decisions for the good of the pets and their owners. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">            You might be curious about what Petozia is and where the name comes from. The word Petozia represents the empire of the pet, where pet citizens live happily with their owner. It would be amazing if Petozia could come true. In Petozia, the citizens send out good products to the world, in order to make all pets and their pet parents live happily together, just like they live in Petozia.</p>

We are happy to hear all of your ideas and suggestions. Mass production is our main challenge, but to lower the risk, hardware is our first concern. Many of our team members have backgrounds in engineering. One of us has more than 10 years of experience in electronic and product design, so a connection with PCB manufacturing makes a perfect manufacturing plan.<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">          We have a partner in the plastic injection and mold industry, a company located in Samutsakorn, Thailand. This factory’s plastic production is standard. They have created products in America, Taiwan and Japan for a long time. One great thing about this project is that the final product is delivered inside shockproof packaging with no additional cost required.</p>

</div></div>","Feed your beloved pet at the right time and with the right quantity, every day, wherever you are in the world via your smartphone. It’s as if there is a “Pet Butler” working for you.

               

            Eating well-portioned meals offers many health benefits for everyone, including your pet. The problem is, your pet has no understanding of this. Eating as much as they like, whenever they like is what your naughty friend would love to do, but this could make him fat or even ill. That is why it is so important that their nutrition and the timing of feedings is carefully controlled.
           You’d like to just pick one of your pet’s favorites and feed them a measured amount, punctually, two or three times a day, but doing this regularly is not easy. You might even consider asking someone to give you a hand. With the Pet Butler, you can load your pet’s favorite food.  One of the most popular choices is dried kibble, because it has numerous nutritional benefits and is convenient.
So without further ado, please let us introduce you to The Pet Butler!












  The Pet Butler can take both manual and scheduled feedings. You can simply give him orders via your smartphone.


    Push notification will keep you informed about every action of the Pet Butler.


    The Pet Butler will keep your beloved pet’s food fresh and delicious.


    Overweight pets risk diabetes, arthritis, and other health problems. The Pet Butler knows that very well, so he will serve the proper amount of food that your pet needs.  You can control food quantity to the nearest 1/8 cup.


    With the Pet Butler’s double body lock, your pets won’t be able to steal the food.



    The Pet Butler will remain on duty even when there is an electrical failure. The battery life lasts up to 3 months.


        The Pet Butler comes in several shapes and colors. Choose your favorite one, that suits your pet and stand out!


    The Pet Butler will call your pets using your voice when the food is ready.



    The Pet Butler is strong enough to handle your pet’s attack. No matter how playful (or determined) your pets are, your Pet Butler will not break apart and hurt them.  The materials that the Pet Butler is made out of are also non-toxic and clean.


     You don't need to be a tech wizard to use the Pet Butler. Use a QR Code (digital barcode) to connect to the mobile app or control the Pet Butler, even when the Internet is not available, using a USB connection. To make it easier to coordinate the Pet Butler with other family members, it can be controlled by multiple mobile devices!

            Giving orders to the Pet Butler is very easy!!! Download the ""Pet Butler"" app to your smartphone.



   You can choose how much and when your pet is served with the touch of a button, from anywhere in the world. Just press ‘Serve.’






   You can easily set up your pet’s scheduled meals from anywhere in the world. You can select the time, amount of food, and the day. For example, the schedule could be set to serve your pet 1 cup of food on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday at 8:00am.





   The Pet Butler will notify user when food has been served, when the storage container is running low, and the percentage of available battery.



   The Pet Butler records the amount of food that your pet has been fed and shows the data in a simple graph. You can easily export the graph to a .pdf file and show your pet’s veterinarian.


   You can add friends or family members to take care of your pet. This helps you to document who fed your pet and when and allows them to control the Pet Butler on their own devices.







         Cool, cute, and friendly, the Pet Butler was carefully designed not only for beauty, but also to provide exceptional service to your pet.









  

       Feeding your pet well is already difficult enough.  You have to watch their nutrition, you have to watch how often they’re fed, and no two pets are quite the same.  Then, of course, some pets are mischievous, destructive, and curious, and nothing ruins a diet like a clever pet.         The most important thing is that you shouldn’t have to worry about your pet whether you’re home or away.  Let the Pet Butler serve your pet and help  you.

















              There are many Pet Butlers and one of them is perfect for your pet!  The white Pet Butler hails from the white tundras of Snow Town.  Strict and accurate to within 1/8th of a cup, the white Pet Butler will keep your pet healthy while blending beautifully with elegant surroundings.  The white Pet Butler match a Persian cat’s fur perfectly.




             The black Pet Butler is sleek and fast and comes from Rocky Mountain.  The Pet Butler talks to your pet, so when you are far from your pet, the black Pet Butler can stand in for you. Use the Pet Butler app to call your pet to the unit using your voice.  The black Pet Butler impresses guests with its modern design. It would match the smooth coat of a Rottweiller very nicely.




             The lime green Pet Butler is from Mistery Forest, but it is hardly a mystery how it works.  Programming the Pet Butler can be done at home, on the go, and whether or not the power is on, giving you one less thing to worry about.  To make things even easier, there are times when it is very helpful to know when your pet was last fed (such as in time of illness or poor nutrition), and the Pet Butler can keep track of those records for you, ready to report back to you.  The lime green Pet Butler helps make any room feel lighter and better balanced.

            The orange Pet Butler travelled from the distant Delight Kingdom.  Already experienced with royalty, the orange Pet Butler knows how to make your pet feel like a king or queen.  Feeding once a day?  Feeding two or three times a day?  Maybe you have a litter of puppies that are eating around the clock?  Pet Butler is extremely customizable.  The orange Pet Butler adds a flair to any room and any pet.











            Many pet parents have had the experience of worrying about whether or not they remembered to feed their pet companion, and that is precisely where the Pet Butler’s story began.
            A few years ago, Phiphi and Sa took a trip to Japan. They left their cats (Hunsa, Jimmy, Tam and Jaaw) with their neighbors during their ten days holiday, but they just couldn’t feel comfortable.  They felt like they were imposing on their neighbors and worried that their cats might not be fed the right quantity on time. When they returned and found, to their relief, that their pets were fine, they decided they didn't want to experience that kind of anxiety again, so together, they invented the world’s first Pet Butler to take care of the pets’ dietary needs for all pet lovers around the world.
           The very first prototype of the Pet Butler was called The Holidays Pet Manager, and with it, Phiphi and Sa won the first place award from the 2013 2nd ICT International Student Conference’s Software Innovation Contest in the category of Multimedia and Embedded systems. 


Before becoming a Pet Butler






 May – September 2013Re-designed the features and architecture for manufacturing. Found the team!
 August – September 2013Sketched out and analyzed many Pet butler designs many times and selected the best one. 
 November 2013 – March 2014Designed Pet Butler’s circuit board, improving from the first prototype’s schematic.
 November 2013 – June 2014Designed and implemented the Pet Butler’s application for iOS devices. 
 March - April 2014Ordered the electronic board prototype. 
 November 2013 – March 2014Combined the mechanisms of conceptual design with the electronic parts and mold design.
 March - May 2014Printed out all parts using a 3D printer. 
 May – June 2014Put all parts together, and then finalized the prototype.




           There are many reasons why we are here at IndieGoGo. First, we believe that all pets deserve to live longer lives with good nutrition and weight management.  Young animals depend on excellent nutrition to reach their maximum growth potential and energy.  Adult animals need excellent nutrition to keep their energy levels high enough for healthy amounts of play and to prevent illness.  Elderly animals need excellent nutrition to live as long as possible, keeping a manageable amount of weight on their aging joints. 
Owners around the world love their pet as a part of their family. We know that pet owners want to provide not only the basic necessities of life but also happiness and health. That is why we decided to leave everything behind and put all our efforts into making the pet butler a reality. 
         All money from contributors will be used for Pet Butler mass production (mold and electronic set up). Finding venture capitalists is also a part of the plan, but we want to help the whole worldwide community of pet lovers to participate and make independent decisions for the good of the pets and their owners. 





            You might be curious about what Petozia is and where the name comes from. The word Petozia represents the empire of the pet, where pet citizens live happily with their owner. It would be amazing if Petozia could come true. In Petozia, the citizens send out good products to the world, in order to make all pets and their pet parents live happily together, just like they live in Petozia.








            We will keep updating our progress for you. We are happy to hear all of your ideas and suggestions. Mass production is our main challenge, but to lower the risk, hardware is our first concern. Many of our team members have backgrounds in engineering. One of us has more than 10 years of experience in electronic and product design, so a connection with PCB manufacturing makes a perfect manufacturing plan.
          We have a partner in the plastic injection and mold industry, a company located in Samutsakorn, Thailand. This factory’s plastic production is standard. They have created products in America, Taiwan and Japan for a long time. One great thing about this project is that the final product is delivered inside shockproof packaging with no additional cost required.

<p>Pocket Parties was created with the mobile consultant in mind. Hearing and seeing the ""party"" life first hand, I noticed a need for an app to stay organized.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

Color is a magical design tool that can be used by every one to transform your world, and I want to share it with you. 
Hi, I'm Denise Hopkins, owner of ImaginEco Design.  I am an architect from Grand Rapids, Michigan.  My mission is to improve your world through architecture, interiors, and landscapes inspired by my intense passion for nature, color, and modern design.  My next project is to seriously delve in to the power of color to enhance lives.  And I need your help.
                                               
I need to raise $4000 to contribute to the cost of an intense course in color and its use in architecture, interiors, and landscapes. So I'm turning to my strongest supporters to ask for contributions. In exchange, I'm offering stunning nature prints, color palettes for your home's interior or exterior, personal design consultations, all to improve your life through incredible, fabulous color! Your contributions will help me expand my knowledge of color and then share it with you and others to improve lives with simply beautiful color.

Colorful Rewards


Your contributions will supplement the cost of a 4-day course in architectural color, including the course cost, course supplies, airfare, and hotel expenses.
To thank you for your support and generosity, I'm offering nature prints that I've personally photographed, color palettes, and personal design consultations. 


Enter to win or donate to receive a personal design consultation.  You'll receive a Design Plan of Action, shown below, with my recommendations for your space.

The Colorful Consequences

I've been fortunate to work with many clients whose lives I've changed through color.  I transformed this tropical condo simply by using a bold color palette.  Here's what my colorful client said, ""Denise designed my condo from a just a shell to a beautiful, exciting, and wonderful place to live.""  This wonderful client shared with me that she never thought she deserved to work with a design professional, and she was going to just paint every thing white.  The fact is that every one of us deserves to have a home and work place that makes us feel inspired or comforted or safe or invigorated.  Color can do that and that's what I want to give to each of you.It's time to bring the most effective design tool, color, to you and the world!
This is a sample of the Up Close and Virtual perk you can receive!

<p>Why Crowdfunding / Warum Crowd Funding<br/></p>
<p><span>Dear friends, fans and supporters,</span> first we would like to thank you for all your support and comments. A lot of you asked, why crowd funding on indiegogo! The reason is, that we would like to try to produce the BlackOut Titanium without any bank loan or other investors. We are dedicated to the product and we do not want to accept any changes concerning quality and functionality based on “financial arguments”.<br/>So crowd funding seems to be a good solution. But be assured, the BlackOut Titanium will be there for all of us in future.<br/>Your Michael and the MANE Tec Team</p>
<p>Liebe Freunde, Fans und Unterstützer, vorab möchten wir uns bei Euch für die vielen positiven Kommentare bedanken. Es gibt sehr oft die Frage, warum Crowdfunding. Der Grund dafür ist, dass wir das ""BlackOut-Titanium"" ohne Kredite herstellen wollen. Wir sind mit unserem Produkt derart verbunden und vertraut, dass wir eine Einflussnahme aus wirtschaftlichen Gründen bzgl. Qualität und Funktionalität, unbedingt vermeiden wollen.

Dear friends, fans and supporters, first we would like to thank you for all your support and comments. A lot of you asked, why crowd funding on indiegogo! The reason is, that we would like to try to produce the BlackOut Titanium without any bank loan or other investors. We are dedicated to the product and we do not want to accept any changes concerning quality and functionality based on “financial arguments”.So crowd funding seems to be a good solution. But be assured, the BlackOut Titanium will be there for all of us in future.Your Michael and the MANE Tec Team
Liebe Freunde, Fans und Unterstützer, vorab möchten wir uns bei Euch für die vielen positiven Kommentare bedanken. Es gibt sehr oft die Frage, warum Crowdfunding. Der Grund dafür ist, dass wir das ""BlackOut-Titanium"" ohne Kredite herstellen wollen. Wir sind mit unserem Produkt derart verbunden und vertraut, dass wir eine Einflussnahme aus wirtschaftlichen Gründen bzgl. Qualität und Funktionalität, unbedingt vermeiden wollen. Darum ist Crowdfunding für uns die ideale Lösung, ...und glaubt mir, das BlackOut-Titanium wird es für uns Angler künftig auch sein.Petri Heil wünscht Euch,Euer Michael und das MANE-Team!

Skutch: All geometry in one tool  
Skutch is above everything
else a remarkable design object. Capable of everything you can expect and more
from a tool of conception. Skutch goes beyond, allowing us to combine design
and geometry in an instinctive and accurate manner. Skutch becomes as never
before an extension of ones hand.




Its design: a revolution

Skutch is a tool that integrates its design as a part of its function. It has a unique shape that has been studied to allow the use of all geometric design functions without limiting creativity.







Solid and extremely light


Skutch is an alloy between sturdiness and design. Made out of
anodized aluminum to prevent abrasion and corrosion. Skutch is available in
four colors. Also, its laser engraved graduations guarantee an excellent
resolution and accuracy as well as perfect resistance. 





A new form of design

Skutch is not just a tool, but also a variety of
possibilities within our reach. Thanks to all the characteristics it offers, such
as being able to draw circles, lines and angles; we have the necessary accuracy
for the creation and experimentation of new forms of expression.






A universal tool inches/ cm
Whether you use metric units or inches, Skutch
allows you to rapidly sketch, draw and design complex and precise shapes in
both measurement units. No more conversion problems, Skutch permits you to draw
in cm or inches with extraordinary precision, ranging from 1 mm to 1/16 inches.



The SKUTCH is here.

<h3>Eboard Secure Mail</h3>
<p>Eboard Secure Mail is a web based private messaging platform that is a more secure communication solution than current email systems. It is being designed and  run by me, Gabriel Evans. I have 11+ years of experience in Systems Design and Engineering. During my time working for everything from small local businesses to multinational enterprises, I have seen first hand the time, money and man hours spent on keeping users safe from phishing and malicious emails.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Email is a <strong>vulnerable</strong> form of communication.</p>
<p>There are many problems with current email systems including:</p>
<p><strong>∙ Phishing ∙ Spam ∙ Email Hijacking ∙</strong></p>
<p>High Profile Incidents:</p>
<p><strong>DNC and Hillary Clinton Hacked Email, Sony email hacking</strong></p>
<p><strong>Securing email systems is costly, complex and doesn’t always work</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Expensive and complex spam filters</li>
<li>Incorrectly tuned email filtering systems</li>
<li>Messages are blocked that should be delivered and some are delivered that shouldn’t be.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Current Systems: Effects of Spam and Malicious Email</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>“Unsolicited mail now accounts for 86 percent of the world's email traffic, with about 400 billion messages sent each day.”</strong> – CISCO</li>
<li>“Researchers’ analysis put the cost of <strong>lost productivity due to SPAM at $14 billion</strong>, attributed mostly to time that workers wasted clearing their inboxes. Adding in additional outlays to organizations on SPAM filters, added storage and network bandwidth brings the <strong>overall cost of dealing with SPAM in the $20 billion ballpark.</strong>”  -Economics of Spam Study</li>
<li>“Verizon combined over eight million results of sanctioned phishing tests in 2015 from multiple security awareness vendors and found that:<ul>
<li>
<strong>30 percent of phishing messages were opened by the target across all campaigns,</strong> up 30 percent from last year.</li>
<li>
<strong>12 percent of users went on to click the malicious attachment or link</strong>, up 9 percent since last year.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>""<strong>Only 3 percent of the targeted individuals reported the phishing email to management.</strong>” Return Path</li>
<li>“<strong>The potential annual cost to a company in the event of a successful phishing attack is around $3.7 million</strong>.” Ponemon Institute</li>
</ul>
<h3>Our Solution</h3>

“Unsolicited mail now accounts for 86 percent of the world's email traffic, with about 400 billion messages sent each day.” – CISCO
“Researchers’ analysis put the cost of lost productivity due to SPAM at $14 billion, attributed mostly to time that workers wasted clearing their inboxes. Adding in additional outlays to organizations on SPAM filters, added storage and network bandwidth brings the overall cost of dealing with SPAM in the $20 billion ballpark.”  -Economics of Spam Study
“Verizon combined over eight million results of sanctioned phishing tests in 2015 from multiple security awareness vendors and found that:

30 percent of phishing messages were opened by the target across all campaigns, up 30 percent from last year.

12 percent of users went on to click the malicious attachment or link, up 9 percent since last year.


""Only 3 percent of the targeted individuals reported the phishing email to management.” Return Path
“The potential annual cost to a company in the event of a successful phishing attack is around $3.7 million.” Ponemon Institute
