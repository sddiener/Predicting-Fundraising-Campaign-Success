<li>Steel: 304 18/8 food-safe stainless steel, providing superior corrosion resistance and durability for a long lifespan.</li>
<li>Bamboo: Not only does the bamboo look stylish, but it is a very functional piece acting as a lid, cutting board and serving try. A little fact about bamboo: it's not chopped down like a tree, but rather harvested like a crop so it's easy to replenish, making it a renewable resource.</li>
<li>Silicone: The leakproof seal and the storage lids are made from food-grade silicone. This inert material makes it food-safe and is tolerant to both hot and cold temperatures.</li>
<li>Polypropylene: The frame hardware offers precision and strength to keep the lid and seal intact for the leakproof confidence.  </li>

 LEAKPROOF Spills in your bag? Hummus on your apples? No thank you. The patent-pending leakproof seal is made of food-grade silicone. It keeps food on the inside from mixing, and wet stuff like salad dressing from spilling in your bag. MODULAR  Choose your own adventure. No one likes to eat the same every.single.day. Some containers limit your options. For the first time, you can have your bento-style box and burrito in it too, a sandwich, veggies and dip, hors d’oeuvres or a mega salad. Add, remove or swap - you choose. Individual containers are great for batch cooking and Sunday meal prep too. EASY TO CLEANSharp angles and tight corners make cleaning tricky. That’s why we don’t have any. Gentle contoured bases make cleaning a cinch so you can get out of the kitchen and back out Exploring.  DURABLEMade with 304 stainless steel, the containers are designed to endure. OVEN SAFE Versatile stainless steel containers are great at home in the oven or in the outdoors. FREEZER SAFENo more broken glass or cracked plastic. Batch cook and stow away to have a meal in a pinch.  COMPACT STORAGE  Now you can reduce your carbon footprint and your storage footprint.  REUSABLE


Each steel container has a pre-printed weight and volume specification to make it easier to go plastic-free. Perfect for salad bars, bulk bins and farmer’s markets. BUT WAIT, THERE'S MOREThe ring frame firmly snaps to the base, but can be easily removed for cleaning and storing. The bamboo lid acts as a cutting board and serving tray. Helpful while you're out and about! To keep the lid seal clean if cutting on dirty surfaces, place the bamboo lid on the ring hardware to avoid direct contact of the seal with the table.The ring frame is specially designed to hold the lid while you eat. One thing worse than a dirty table is your lid on the dirty table!No need to wonder what's behind that stainless steel in your fridge, wax pencils or dry/wet-erase markers make for a quick and easy label! And have fun writing notes to your little ones if you're prepping lunches for school.The inserts are thoughtfully designed to be universal with the Adventure and Explorer Kit systems. 
 Farmers Markets or Bulk Shopping - use in place of the single use plastic bins/bags that are typically given out. Remember, all the steel containers have a tare weight and volume in case you need them.Ball Games - Eat healthier by bringing your own food and save a ton of money at the same time by not buying concession stand food! Because the inserts are modular and removable, they make for great pass-around snacks while you're watching the game.Work or Travel - The Explorer and Adventure Kits make the perfect companion wherever you go.Beaches, lakes, pools - No Glass Allowed. No Problem. Charcuterie by the shore anyone?Camping or Hiking - What’s the perfect trail food? Pack a survival kit with shelf-stable dried nuts, seeds, fruit and jerky. The Explorer and Adventure Kits slide into you bag and keep you fueled on the journey.School - The Explorer and Adventure Kits make for great school lunchboxes. And because they are leakproof, they can be placed upright with no mess! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We have ongoing R&D to create markets for materials that already exist that would otherwise be waste destined for landfills or oceans. What will we come up with next?? Currently, the premium materials included...
Steel: 304 18/8 food-safe stainless steel, providing superior corrosion resistance and durability for a long lifespan.
Bamboo: Not only does the bamboo look stylish, but it is a very functional piece acting as a lid, cutting board and serving try. A little fact about bamboo: it's not chopped down like a tree, but rather harvested like a crop so it's easy to replenish, making it a renewable resource.
Silicone: The leakproof seal and the storage lids are made from food-grade silicone. This inert material makes it food-safe and is tolerant to both hot and cold temperatures.
Polypropylene: The frame hardware offers precision and strength to keep the lid and seal intact for the leakproof confidence.

  These crush-resistant silicone inserts are part of the next system in the family of reVessel products that will work together or in place of the stainless steel inserts. You can mix and match as needed. They are built tough, designed to work with the leakproof bamboo lid kit. They are especially helpful when needing to heat up your food in a microwave.  

  A little bit of our journey from initial concept and early exploration to design and manufacturing. It has been an incredible 2 years in the making!
 
We’re new to Indiegogo but not new to developing and delivering premium products. After launching our first flagship system, The Adventure Kit, we learned from our Community how important it was to safely and easily pack and carry an array of meals and snacks for kids and adults on quicker trips. The Explorer Kit was created in response to the need.With our designs for the Explorer Kit complete, supply chain in place, suppliers ready to go, we can’t wait to get this project underway and bring powerful tools to keep you adventuring or exploring consciously while enjoying your favorite food. Much of the testing has already been passed. We will use the backer funds to initiate the development of the new Explorer Kit molds and begin to introduce some fun designs to the ring hardware so you can have your own unique look. Based in San Diego, CA, reVessel is a sustainable brand focusing on designing morally conscious products to better prepare, store, and carry food without compromising the environment or our values. We created the company based on our own health and wellness quests and a mutual desire to have better options to bake, freeze, store and travel with our food to the office, our children’s school, sporting events, the beach, and roadtrips.Crafted alongside a team of deep sea and underwater mechanical engineers, reVessel's products are tested to be leakproof and submersible. Additionally, each unit is reusable, modular, toxin-free and eco-friendly, replacing the 1460 sandwich bags a typical child's lunch could require annually. These containers add functionality to meals and a convenient way to develop healthy habits that frees us from relying on outsourcing food and single-use plastics while reducing exposure to toxins so that we can fully live.reVessel hopes to spark a ripple effect of healthy and sustainable change.   
 Beyond the beautiful and versatile products, we intend to use our business to positively influence some of the world’s challenges using long-lasting, premium materials. Much of our food produced in the US lacks nutrients and comes with as many as 700 chemicals. A portion of proceeds from reVessel sales goes back to protecting future generations by supporting farmers in growing regenerative food, rehabilitating our oceans and setting a new standard by offsetting our Company’s entire carbon footprint. 
  
 
 We are a team composed of engineers, designers, health professionals and even leakproofing gurus. We care so much about our planet and we are committed to developing products that are good for you and good for the planet.",114.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>A draft stopper is sewn around. You can push the draft stopper down to keep out drafts for comfortable warmth, or you can easily ventilate when it gets too warm. The draft stopper and hood work together to wrap your body in warmth.</p>

<p>*A mattress is important for the power of this quilt. We recommend a mattress with an ""R value of 3"" for a -4 degree quilt and an ""R value of 5"" for a -12 degree quilt. * Since the sensible temperature has various factors and variables depending on the individual such as body shape, constitution, tent used, mat, physical condition, etc., please understand it as a reference value only.</p> <h3>Sleep in any position you want</h3> <p>Solo quilts can sleep on their backs, sideways or freestyle.</p>
<p>The solo quilt hood has an extra length that extends beyond the shoulders and neck, and the simple contour design makes it easy to wrap the quilt around your body or head. It keeps out drafts and allows you to comfortably cover your head no matter how you sleep.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Feature packed for all weather adventures:

 

Designed and evolved over 8 years by hikers in the Himalayas, it is ultralight, compact and versatile.


Tried and tested by hikers worldwide, the innovative hybrid design lets you manage ventilation when things in your tent start to heat up.

Ideal for cold, wet and damp conditions like in the PNW, UK, Scandinavia or the Himalayas
Designed to let you spread out and let you sleep in any sleeping position, ideal for side sleepers
Available in 2 different temperature ratings (-4 C and -12 C)  3 size options (S,M,L).

Washable and easy-drying.
The Blue Bolt solo quilt is a sleeping system made from cutting edge Climashield® APEX insulation with an outer bivy shell and a vapor-barrier inner lining that prevent internal condensation, keeping the insulation dry. 

Blue Bolt solo quilt is a hybrid sleeping bag designed to change the way you sleep after a strenuous day outdoors. The Hybrid design brings the comfort of a quilt together with the performance of a sleeping bag. The integrated hood gives you full coverage of a sleeping bag, which quilts typically don't offer. 

It's been tried, tested and appreciated.
In 2019, our sleeping bag went on a 3000 km epic adventure with Peter Van Geit. He completed a 4-month alpine-style minimalist ultra hike across 120 passes in remote western Himalayas and had a very positive experience in using the Blue Bolt solo quilt.
He says, ""It's super light and comfortable even while sleeping at near zero temperatures. I did not carry a tent and was mostly sleeping in the open with just the quilt and basic sleeping mat. I only used a lightweight bivy in case of rains and cold winds in which the quilt again was providing comfort and warmth from 1000 to 5000 meters altitude."" 

Our solo quilt has been used and loved by adventurers in Europe and North America:

The blade is also perforated to allow cutting and slicing of materials to not stick onto the blade itself. It provides a cleaner sharper cut.</p><p><strong>Sizing: </strong>Discrete conceal-ability is the definition of the B-2 Dog Tag. The full opened length is only 3.7inches and when closed, it stands at 2.75inches in length and less than 0.2 inches in thickness. The miniature size of the pocket knife means it can easily be hidden in any coin pocket, wallet, or worn around the neck as a standard dog tag.</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> The ultralight weight of the B-2 Nano Blade comes in at less than 2oz making it the world's lightest, fully functional, 440Carbon black stainless steel tactical pocket knife.</p><p><strong>Materials: </strong>440C black stainless steel allows B-2 pocket knives to be one of the strongest nano blades ever created by mankind. Rated at 58-60HRC the B-2 Dog Tag is extremely tough and will stay sharp for longer periods of use. 440C is a highly durable and corrosion resistant stainless steel. The B-2 Dog Tag can endure years of outdoor wear without extra maintenance to protect the blade from rusting.</p><p><strong>Butterfly Lock:</strong> The B-2 Dog Tag uses a custom designed double-sided butterfly lock. Safety was one of the main concerns when it comes to a nano blade/knife of this size. We wanted the design the be suitable for beginners as well as intermediate knife experts. The lock is released by squeezing both sides of the B-2 Dog Tag and engaged automatically when let go. This makes the knife design much more robust than traditional smaller blades which are just folding with no locks. The user can feel and hear the tactile sound and click on the lock.</p><p><strong>Durability Tested: </strong>While designing the B-2 Dog Tag, we made sure to leave ZERO wiggle room. Once locked into place, the blade is completely tight and will not move. It was incredibly difficult engineering this, as the B-2 Dog Tag is very small in size.

</div></div>","The original B-2 Nano Blade Tactical Pocket Knife first debuted in 2017.  It raised nearly $500K in total funding with over 6,000 backers and went on to become the World's Most Successful Pocket knife selling over 30k units worldwide in its first year.  We're back on Kickstarter with a complete redesign of the B-2 Nano Blade, this time concealed inside a discreet military style sheath.  After 5 successful campaigns and early delivery each time, Bomber & Company is extremely proud to introduce the newest addition to our collection, the B-2 Dog Tag, a fully concealed nano blade pocket knife.


 




 

 
   Dimensions:UltraLight Weight: < 2ozLength of Knife (opened): 3.7inLength of Knife (closed): 2.75inLength of Blade: 1inThickness: 0.2inHandle Length: 2.5inMaterials (Blade and Body): 440Carbon Black Stainless SteelHardness: 58-60HRC (Rockwell Hardness Scale)Color: Jet Black Straight Edge Blade: The sharp flat ground straight edge is perfect for thin sharp precision slices and versatility of everyday use. The blade is also perforated to allow cutting and slicing of materials to not stick onto the blade itself. It provides a cleaner sharper cut.Sizing: Discrete conceal-ability is the definition of the B-2 Dog Tag. The full opened length is only 3.7inches and when closed, it stands at 2.75inches in length and less than 0.2 inches in thickness. The miniature size of the pocket knife means it can easily be hidden in any coin pocket, wallet, or worn around the neck as a standard dog tag.Weight: The ultralight weight of the B-2 Nano Blade comes in at less than 2oz making it the world's lightest, fully functional, 440Carbon black stainless steel tactical pocket knife.Materials: 440C black stainless steel allows B-2 pocket knives to be one of the strongest nano blades ever created by mankind. Rated at 58-60HRC the B-2 Dog Tag is extremely tough and will stay sharp for longer periods of use. 440C is a highly durable and corrosion resistant stainless steel. The B-2 Dog Tag can endure years of outdoor wear without extra maintenance to protect the blade from rusting.Butterfly Lock: The B-2 Dog Tag uses a custom designed double-sided butterfly lock. Safety was one of the main concerns when it comes to a nano blade/knife of this size. We wanted the design the be suitable for beginners as well as intermediate knife experts. The lock is released by squeezing both sides of the B-2 Dog Tag and engaged automatically when let go. This makes the knife design much more robust than traditional smaller blades which are just folding with no locks. The user can feel and hear the tactile sound and click on the lock.Durability Tested: While designing the B-2 Dog Tag, we made sure to leave ZERO wiggle room. Once locked into place, the blade is completely tight and will not move. It was incredibly difficult engineering this, as the B-2 Dog Tag is very small in size. We made sure to trial and error fractions of a millimeter to finally get the B-2 Dog Tag to hit perfection.Lifetime Warranty: We can ensure that all of our products are made with the highest quality in mind as we would never offer a product that we would not use ourselves. All Bomber & Company products carry a full Lifetime Warranty.  If it ever breaks, send it back to us. We'll replace it free of charge.

We design and make premium quality EDC tools. This is our 5th campaign on Indiegogo, and this time around we’re doing something a bit different. With your support, we’re making our best products even better.
 

 

 
We believe we made the best keychain flashlight. It's everything we ever wanted a Micro flashlight to be. We think you will feel the same.
The “Pop-to-Light” solution provides an extremely convenient, easy, fast way to use when you need powerful light in a hurry. The upgraded version is smallest, lightest,  brightest, more durable, and most convenient.
 

 

 
Sometimes you just need a strong light, fast. With YSMART Bullet you get a handy, EDC flashlight that you can take it with you anywhere, and light up anything in an instant. Just Pop it to Turn it On！
 

 
No more searching blindly around in the dark or fumbling around to unlock your flashlight. We’ve done away with the need to twist your flashlight to turn it on/off. YSMART Bullet provides a magnetic quick-release solution. Simply pull it off your keychain then the flashlight turns on immediately.
 

 

 
Never worry about accidentally disconnecting your YSMART Bullet. Featuring a powerful magnet with 2.5kg/4.8lb of pulling force, you can place it anywhere without worrying about it falling off. 
 


 
Extending the light’s functionality, the magnet can be attached to metal surfaces for hands-free.
 

Hands-free use
 

 
With YSMART Bullet, we’ve created the most powerful micro flashlight yet. You get 100 lumens packed into a tiny, robust design.
 
 We wanted to do better than the already-stunning original YSMART 2.0, so we upgraded our equipment to feature a state-of-the-art SUPER THIN SMD LED module, which offers maximum output for minimum energy consumption.   YSMART Bullet is small enough to carry wherever you go. Your sports bag, your jacket, and even attach to your keychain. It's a perfect match for any indoor or outdoor activities. Stun your friends at the bright mini marvel on your keychain.   This amazing design is made of signature copper or solid ultra-tough titanium. YSMART Bullet not only looks great but is practically indestructible.   The GO (Glow On) Version comes readily equipped with six Luminova vials,  which will glow non-stop for five years. The vials can be charged up by you shining a bright light source. The brightness depends on the time, intensity and colour of the light that it was exposed to before.They are available as an ADD-ON to your pledge reward. If you choose this glow-in-the-dark upgrade, you will have the blue vials for the titanium flashlight and the orange vials for the copper flashlight.  N.B.: Due to legal restrictions, we can’t supply Tritium vials.  But if you can obtain Tritium vials legally and safely in your location. Then simply paste your tritium vials or your own other vials into the already built-in six tiny slots on the top of the flashlight, the installation is simple and easy.   SPECIFICATIONS

The B-2 Nano Blade is engineered to hold durability and functionality similar to military grade equipment. Vincent Pilot Ng (Lead Designer) has had over 10 years of professional experience in product design. He has brought about other renown products to markets such as the <a href=""https://www.yankodesign.com/2015/08/07/the-bomber-advantage-bomber-paracord-survival-gear/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag</a> and <a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/3027269/this-glowing-led-bike-light-you-can-wear-keeps-you-safe-on-dark-streets"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Halo Belt</a>.</p><p><b>Blade:</b> The blade is split with a serrated teeth edge as well as a sharp edge. The sharp edge is perfect for thin sharp precision slices whereas the teeth is perfect for tougher materials like wood. The B-2 Nano Blade uses the ""Great American Tooth"" pattern much like in traditional crosscut tree saws. The pattern was designed specifically to saw and rake wood fibers. The blade is also perforated to allow cutting and slicing of materials to not stick onto the blade itself. It provides a cleaner sharper cut.</p><div data-id=""16108517""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.bomberco.com/b2bombernanobladebestpocketknife/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt='The B-2 Nano Blade cuts using the ""Great American Tooth"" pattern.

We were looking into both options during the design process and concluded that a flat ground blade would be more versatile for most people's daily use of an every day carry. </p><p>The <i>serrated</i> part (teeth) of the blade, however, is a chisel ground. We designed the serrated part of the knife to be able to scrape flint or even split wood. The blade itself is very robust and the serrated chisel can be used to wedge and pry. </p><p>Although the knife is very small, it was engineered to be very tactical. The versatility of both blade styles give it an advantage over every other small pocket knife.</p><p><b>Sizing: </b><i>Discrete concealability</i> is the definition of the B-2 Nano Blade. The full opened length is only 80mm and when closed, it stands at 48mm in length, 20mm in width (closed) and only 5mm thick. The miniature size of the pocket knife means it can easily be hidden in any coin pocket or clipped onto keychains without notice.</p><p><b>Weight: </b>The ultralight weight of the B-2 Nano Blade comes in at <b><i>less than 1oz </i></b>making it the <b><i>world's lightest, fully functional, 440C black stainless steel tactical pocket knife. </i></b></p><div data-id=""16108519""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.bomberco.com/b2bombernanobladebestpocketknife/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""The B-2 Nano Blade is the smallest and lightest tactical pocket knife in the world."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1496676433/y8ldxeyowbecrnnl9fxh.jpg"" src=""""/> </a><figcaption><a href=""http://www.bomberco.com/b2bombernanobladebestpocketknife/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The B-2 Nano Blade is the smallest and lightest tactical pocket knife in the world.</a></figcaption><a href=""http://www.bomberco.com/b2bombernanobladebestpocketknife/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a></figure></div><p><b>Materials:</b> 440C black stainless steel allows B-2 pocket knives to be one of the strongest nano blades ever created by mankind. Rated at 58-60HRC the B-2 Nano Blade is extremely tough and will stay sharp for longer periods of use. 440C is a highly durable and corrosion resistant stainless steel. The B-2 Nano Blade can endure years of outdoor wear without extra maintenance to protect the blade from rusting.</p><p><b>Casing Design:</b> The B-2 Bomber Nano Blade Pocket Knife embodies a full redesign of the vintage SR288 stock casing. Originally, this<i> discontinued </i>casing was used for full-sized pocket knives ranging from 5 to 9 inches. The reason we have chosen this stock casing is because of its ease of use, comfort, and reliability in tactical use. Our redesign of the stock casing has given the body a tremendous upgrade in quality as well as addressed the original flaws that didn't make it a versatile knife. </p><p>We have upgraded the casing material to a heat treated 440C black stainless steel and shrunken the size dramatically to a miniature version similar to its older brother. In addition, we upgraded the blade material to 440C black stainless steel to achieve a 58-60HRC hardness scale. </p><p>Upon doing so, we were able to add the Great American Tooth pattern for ""sawing"" tougher materials like wood. Staying true to its size proportionally, the thickness of the casing comes in at 5mm. Ultimately, with the entire redesign, we were able to increase the overall mobility, strengthen the tactical utility of use, make it fully concealable by size, while maintaining a very comfortable hold and improving the military/tactical aesthetics of the entire pocket knife. </p><div data-id=""16247559""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.bomberco.com/b2bombernanobladebestpocketknife/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Safety as a priority - Snap Lock leaves zero wiggle room and prevents accidental closing when in use."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1496676433/uvpbzj5lkneg1aijqezb.jpg"" src=""""/> </a><figcaption><a href=""http://www.bomberco.com/b2bombernanobladebestpocketknife/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Safety as a priority - Snap Lock leaves zero wiggle room and prevents accidental closing when in use.</a></figcaption><a href=""http://www.bomberco.com/b2bombernanobladebestpocketknife/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a></figure></div><p><b>Folding/Locking:</b> The B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is both locking and folding. Safety was one of the main concerns when it comes to a knife of this size. We wanted the design the be suitable for beginners as well as intermediate knife experts. The lock is a lever rather than a push button lock. You can actually use the spine to scrap splint without the worry of it coming around when the blade is locked. This makes the knife design much more robust than traditional smaller blades which are just folding.</p><p>When the B-2 Nano Blade opens, the lever ""SNAPS"" into place to lock the blade from accidentally closing when in use. The user can feel and hear the tactile sound and click on the lock. To close, all you have to do is press the locking lever to open.</p><p>While designing the B-2, we made sure to leave ZERO wiggle room. Once locked into place, the blade is completely tight and will not move. It was incredibly difficult engineering this, as the B-2 is very small in size. We made sure to trial and error fractions of a millimeter to finally get the B-2 to hit perfection.</p><p><b>The B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is the world's smallest and lightest tactical pocket knife ever to be created by mankind.</b></p><div data-id=""15983476""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.bomberco.com/b2bombernanobladebestpocketknife/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1496676434/sioz4ymuvsot0kgmwi3v.jpg"" src=""""/> </a></figure></div><p><b><i> Minimal and Versatile</i></b></p><div data-id=""15822597""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.bomberco.com/b2bombernanobladebestpocketknife/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1496676434/uns8t2ufutkee047ux78.jpg"" src=""""/> </a></figure></div><p><b>Robust and Precise</b></p><div data-id=""15983449""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.bomberco.com/b2bombernanobladebestpocketknife/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1496676435/ih0vby7lbvnzumz1opee.jpg"" src=""""/> </a></figure></div><p> <b>Functional and Tactical</b></p><div data-id=""15983619""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""http://www.bomberco.com/b2bombernanobladebestpocketknife/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1496676436/ogk3ll3etqlntt5dtjnj.jpg"" src=""""/> </a></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""16326292""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><div data-dimensions='{""width"":680,""height"":382}' data-image=""https://d15chbti7ht62o.cloudfront.net/assets/016/326/292/4e249fe3f34e711de9bde7c950419582_h264_high.jpg?2017"" data-video-url=""https://ksr-video.imgix.net/assets/016/326/292/4e249fe3f34e711de9bde7c950419582_h264_high.mp4"">

We believe that your everyday gear should be functional and minimal. We're here to design quality products that all hold a life-time warranty.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","B-2 Bomber Nano Blade Tactical Pocket KnifeInspired by the B-2 Stealth Bomber military aircraft, the B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is the last everyday pocket knife you will ever need to carry. The mini tactical B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is designed with precision and detail that allows it to be extremely robust and versatile in every survival situation. We wanted to design a quality miniature tactical pocket knife that can endure the toughest daily tasks and also small enough to carry without notice. In other words, we wanted an all around badass pocket knife that was fully concealable.           Urban Military Concept: All of our Bomber & Company products have a military design and tactical aesthetic. The B-2 Nano Blade is engineered to hold durability and functionality similar to military grade equipment. Vincent Pilot Ng (Lead Designer) has had over 10 years of professional experience in product design. He has brought about other renown products to markets such as the Bomber Barrel Duffle Bag and Halo Belt.Blade: The blade is split with a serrated teeth edge as well as a sharp edge. The sharp edge is perfect for thin sharp precision slices whereas the teeth is perfect for tougher materials like wood. The B-2 Nano Blade uses the ""Great American Tooth"" pattern much like in traditional crosscut tree saws. The pattern was designed specifically to saw and rake wood fibers. The blade is also perforated to allow cutting and slicing of materials to not stick onto the blade itself. It provides a cleaner sharper cut. The B-2 Nano Blade cuts using the ""Great American Tooth"" pattern. Wood or other tough materials can be sawed and raked. The non-serrated part of the blade or precision cut blade is flat ground. We were looking into both options during the design process and concluded that a flat ground blade would be more versatile for most people's daily use of an every day carry. The serrated part (teeth) of the blade, however, is a chisel ground. We designed the serrated part of the knife to be able to scrape flint or even split wood. The blade itself is very robust and the serrated chisel can be used to wedge and pry. Although the knife is very small, it was engineered to be very tactical. The versatility of both blade styles give it an advantage over every other small pocket knife.Sizing: Discrete concealability is the definition of the B-2 Nano Blade. The full opened length is only 80mm and when closed, it stands at 48mm in length, 20mm in width (closed) and only 5mm thick. The miniature size of the pocket knife means it can easily be hidden in any coin pocket or clipped onto keychains without notice.Weight: The ultralight weight of the B-2 Nano Blade comes in at less than 1oz making it the world's lightest, fully functional, 440C black stainless steel tactical pocket knife.  The B-2 Nano Blade is the smallest and lightest tactical pocket knife in the world. Materials: 440C black stainless steel allows B-2 pocket knives to be one of the strongest nano blades ever created by mankind. Rated at 58-60HRC the B-2 Nano Blade is extremely tough and will stay sharp for longer periods of use. 440C is a highly durable and corrosion resistant stainless steel. The B-2 Nano Blade can endure years of outdoor wear without extra maintenance to protect the blade from rusting.Casing Design: The B-2 Bomber Nano Blade Pocket Knife embodies a full redesign of the vintage SR288 stock casing. Originally, this discontinued casing was used for full-sized pocket knives ranging from 5 to 9 inches. The reason we have chosen this stock casing is because of its ease of use, comfort, and reliability in tactical use. Our redesign of the stock casing has given the body a tremendous upgrade in quality as well as addressed the original flaws that didn't make it a versatile knife. We have upgraded the casing material to a heat treated 440C black stainless steel and shrunken the size dramatically to a miniature version similar to its older brother. In addition, we upgraded the blade material to 440C black stainless steel to achieve a 58-60HRC hardness scale. Upon doing so, we were able to add the Great American Tooth pattern for ""sawing"" tougher materials like wood. Staying true to its size proportionally, the thickness of the casing comes in at 5mm. Ultimately, with the entire redesign, we were able to increase the overall mobility, strengthen the tactical utility of use, make it fully concealable by size, while maintaining a very comfortable hold and improving the military/tactical aesthetics of the entire pocket knife.  Safety as a priority - Snap Lock leaves zero wiggle room and prevents accidental closing when in use. Folding/Locking: The B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is both locking and folding. Safety was one of the main concerns when it comes to a knife of this size. We wanted the design the be suitable for beginners as well as intermediate knife experts. The lock is a lever rather than a push button lock. You can actually use the spine to scrap splint without the worry of it coming around when the blade is locked. This makes the knife design much more robust than traditional smaller blades which are just folding.When the B-2 Nano Blade opens, the lever ""SNAPS"" into place to lock the blade from accidentally closing when in use. The user can feel and hear the tactile sound and click on the lock. To close, all you have to do is press the locking lever to open.While designing the B-2, we made sure to leave ZERO wiggle room. Once locked into place, the blade is completely tight and will not move. It was incredibly difficult engineering this, as the B-2 is very small in size. We made sure to trial and error fractions of a millimeter to finally get the B-2 to hit perfection.The B-2 Bomber Nano Blade is the world's smallest and lightest tactical pocket knife ever to be created by mankind.  Minimal and Versatile Robust and Precise  Functional and Tactical

 B-2 Bomber Nano Blade Pocket Knife Uses      Hi-Res Gallery: HERE  Prototyping:The following shows the steps of prototyping as well as process of how the B-2 Nano Blade came to life. During the design process, we had a few key elements we wanted to incorporate into the B-2 Nano Blade. The knife had to be small enough to carry discretely, however still big enough to be used as a functional knife. It also needs to be extremely durable. Consequently, we decided to use 440Carbon stainless steel because it is corrosion resistant as well as stronger than most standard 5Cr13MoV stainless steels. Early Sketches of the B-2 Nano Blade   Early Sketches while prototyping of the B-2 Nano Blade The following picture shows a 2 dimentional drawing of the B-2 Nano Blade. It was our first drawing of the knife. It gives us the very basic design look and length.  Once we achieved the perfect look and tactical feel of the knife, we were able to create a CAD rendering. Early 2D drawing of the B-2 Nano Blade with vertical perforated holes on the blade. Once we had the 2D drawing, we were able to start making a visual product with depth. We then adjusted the thickness of the knife in the CAD rendering to create the perfect 3D model. We then use the 3D CAD model as a blueprint for the first tangible product. 3D CAD modeled design of the B-2 Nano Blade Below is the first handmade prototype of the B-2 Nano Blade. We had used sheet aluminum to wire cut the first prototypes.  As you can see in the pictures, we had cut out the holes for the screws as well as perforation in the blade using this method. This was not a functional prototype, as it was not safe enough to use. The sheet aluminum is soft and just an early design to understand the overall feel, weight, and hold of the knife. Once we had the overall aesthetics of the knife down, we needed it to be fully functional in the following steps. First hand made prototype In the second prototype, we managed to produce it out of real stainless steel. Using 5Cr13MoV stainless steel, we were able to achieve a stronger, more tactile, precise, and functional prototype. This gave us an understanding of first case usage, mobility, and design aesthetics. We also added more functionality to the blade by adding a hole for a keyring, as well as tilted the perforated slots in the blade to a 15 degree angle.  This allowed material to slide off easier than standard verticle perforated holes.  The second prototype does not have a blade edge or a serrated blade. 2nd Prototype - No serrated ground on blade | Made from standard 5Cr13MoV stainless steel Our third prototype, we added a precision grind onto the blade. We originally decided to go with a serrated blade ""chisel grind"" (meaning only one side of the blade was sharpened) because we were going to add a serrated section.  The following final prototype shows a ""flat grind"" on the blade because it allowed both left and right handed users.  It was ultimately more versatile. As you can see in the video below, we show the differences between the final prototype and the third prototype with different grinds on the blade.

Solar chargers are great, if you have the time and the sun is shining.There are also the old-fashioned 'crank' generators, but they are very awkward, tiring and inefficient (because they rely solely on limited wrist rotation), and only the most expensive models actually work.   We’ve designed a solution that is superior to everything else out there on the market.Not only can you recharge LIFESABER with a simply twirling or crank motion, but you can also recharge it from a wall outlet - or even a solar panel - so that the replaceable, high-capacity internal battery is always topped off.The LIFESABER comes equipped with a replaceable 2200 mAh capacity battery. This gives you more than enough juice to call for help, or to browse the web for routes, trails, and other valuable data.With the ruggedly-built LIFESABER in your backpack, glove compartment or bug-out bag, you'll never be alone in an emergency.  The optional snap-in UV Water Purifier treats micro-biologically unsafe water with germicidal ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet water purification is a common method for disinfecting bacteria from water (but by no means a cure-all).It's suitable for treating water taken from a river or stream that looks clear, but contains dangerous microorganisms. After three minutes of cranking, you’ll have enough power to sterilize one liter of unsafe water.   Just insert and gently twirl to purify water. You'll have better drinking water in a matter of three minutes.UV water purifiers haven proven to be extremely effective at eliminating unwanted bacteria and germs from drinking water. The UV wavelength scrambles the DNA of any organisms in the water, so that they can’t replicate and make you sick. This is a well-documented process that is backed in science (see more links at end of this section). It is a completely safe process and does not add any harmful chemicals to the water. As long as you don’t touch or look directly into the UV bulb, it poses no threat.Do note, that these devices are only intended for use with clear water and that the volume of the container will determine the correct use of the UV wand (including time of immersion and the requirement to stir the water).We developed our UV snap-in module in response to requests from the hundreds of outdoor activists who we surveyed, many of whom are familiar with the safety and efficacy of using handheld UV devices, such as the Steripen™ (which is the gold standard and the basis for our functional specifications). The owner of Steripen is Katadyn, a long-established Swiss company specializing in water treatment at all scales. We do not have a formal relationship with Katadyn, (or its Steripen subsidiary).They recognized that our UV wand could be made lighter (without sacrificing quality) since we wouldn't be duplicating the battery, controls, etc. already built into the LIFESABER. Below, you can find a collection of articles supporting the use of handheld UV devices for water purification. SteriPEN Ultra Review (with Lab Test Results) South AmericaDrinking water treatment with ultraviolet light for travelers -- Evaluation of a mobile lightweight system.Drinking water treatment with ultraviolet light for travelers – Evaluation of a mobile lightweight systemTesting of SteriPEN™, a Portable Ultraviolet Light Water Purifier, Using MS-2 Coliphage in Challenge Test Waters According to the U.S.E.P.A. Protocol’s Recommended Materials.  LIFESABER comes with a second optional snap-in attachment that starts fires in wind or rain with the press of a button.The snap-in fire starter (sold separately) creates a 2,000F degree arc to start fires even in the roughest weather. Three minutes of cranking will power 16 ignition cycles.  Unlike a butane or methane lighter, absolutely no lighter fluid is required. Plasma lighters are battery powered.Butane lighters contain flammable gas, which can break or spill in your backpack. Our lighter doesn’t contain any flammable gas. It’s built for rugged outdoor use, making it simple and practical.Cook yourself a meal, or stay warm.  Don’t get lost in the dark.Three minutes of cranking will power the built-in 31 lumens flashlight for up 30 minutes of use. You can even twirl LIFESABER to recharge as you are walking along the trail.  Illuminate your tent or campsite. Three minutes of cranking will power the built-in 31 lumens lantern for up to 30 minutes.  To signal rescuers (even flying overhead), or to startle animal or human intruders, select the built-in strobe light. Three minutes of cranking will power the strobe for up to 40 minutes.Also, with one button, you can trigger both the emergency siren and blinding strobe. This will get everyone’s attention, while disorienting any attacker.The 85-decibel siren will operate for 35 minutes after just three minutes of cranking.With a reliable flashlight/lantern and emergency strobe button, LIFESABER is a solid investment in your family's future!  The LIFESABER personal energy generator represents a technological revolution in efficiency and comfort. Our unique blend of patent-pending mechatronics enables even a child to generate the power they need in an emergency. The multi-jointed, telescoping handle of the LIFESABER enables a full 5 degrees of flexibility which accommodates the natural motion of the hand, wrist and forearm. In contrast, the crank of a typical manual generator is short and inflexible. This means that all the work has to be done by the wrist – which is awkward and quickly becomes tiring.   The weighted grip at the end of our handle permits this swing arm to be 'twirled' much like the motion of a jump rope. This is a very comfortable activity which kids can sustain for hours on the playground.Alternatively, the extended handle can be gripped for power-cranking, putting the strength of the entire arm to work.Which brings us to our unique and essential force-multiplier technology.It stands to reason that you can overcome much greater resistance (torque) while cranking than when twirling.  With the LIFESABER, the user can electronically (rather than mechanically) set the resistance (think gearing) to suit the mode (twirl vs. crank) and to match the person's strength. The higher the force multiplier setting, the more work will be accomplished during each rotation (and the faster you will generate electricity).That's why we expect that it will require a typical person (even a child) 15 minutes to generate a Quick Charge of 900 joules at the lowest resistance setting, while only 3 minutes of power cranking will produce the same results at the highest resistance setting. You can think of our proprietary technology as a kind of distant cousin to regenerative braking.   We created the LIFESABER as a potentially life saving tool for:
Campers and Hikers 
Hunters and Fishermen 
Recreational Boaters 
Other Outdoor Enthusiasts 
Prepping and Emergency Kits 
Urban Survival Situations 
As Power Backup in the Glove Compartment 
Anyone who can’t afford to have their mobile phone die when they most need it! 
   LIFESABER Iterations & 5 Year Development HistoryIdeation on the high-level spec for what was originally called the Personal Energy Generator (PEG) began more than 5 years ago. The challenge was to create a self-charging device that even a child could use to generate lifesaving power, but which would be ergonomically efficient for use by even the strongest adults. Of course, the device would also have to be compact, affordable, lightweight and wilderness-friendly.  After 3 years and dozens of false starts and dead ends, I had an epiphany which led to the first of the technical breakthroughs which would be required. Specifically, development of a swing arm that could both be twirled (like a jump rope) yet comfortably cranked. The resulting PowerGrip™ was successfully prototyped in July of 2018, which featured a telescoping arm with a weighted handle for twirling. It also served as the handle grip while for cranking. We created a unique, multi--jointed design which enables an unprecedented 5 degrees of freedom in the arm’s motion. This results in comfortable, sustainable twirling or cranking while bringing to bear the full forearm strength of the user.  But while necessary, the PowerGrip was not sufficient in order to realize the ambitious product objective. It took hundreds of additional hours to prove-out the second breakthrough technology – a dynamically adjustable torque control achieved solely through electronics (no mechanical gearing).  In June of this year we completed our most advanced working prototype, enabling the user to toggle the ‘Force Multiplier’ circuit to match the rotation-resistance to the type of input (twirl vs. crank) and the strength of the user.   This sophisticated prototype was privately demonstrated – to real acclaim – at the Outdoor Retailer show in Denver. While functional, none of our existing prototypes are optimized for manufacturability, which is why we've come on Kickstarter! How confident are you that you can deliver? I have many successful products on the market. The folks who backed my Lil Trucker Kickstarter campaign were pleased with the tools I delivered. In the risks/milestones section of the campaign page we detail the years of work to get to this point where we've demonstrated the crucial technologies - including the 'force multiplier' system.I have a colleague with a PhD in electrical engineering who has run all of the development and testing of the patent-pending circuitry. We are very confident in the physics/electronics as well as mechatronics overall.  Partners This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 850+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $370M raised between them.",41.0,0,"1 Campaign

Nobody loved the canopies that are currently in the market, but they were a “necessary evil”.  Many items in the marketplace advertise ease of setup and portability, but none of them actually executed on this promise.We decided to leverage our collective design and manufacturing expertise to develop a product that provides truly effortless shade and shelter, sets up quickly, and is easy to transport.  We believe Aeri is just that, are so excited to share our creation with you.  Thanks so much for all your support and we hope to see Aeri accompany you on all your outdoor adventures.Alex LaetschAfter graduating from the University of Southern California with a Bachelors in International Business, Alex began a career in consumer products, managing national retail accounts throughout the US in a variety of different industries. During this time, Alex also had a brief stint as a pool float inflatable model.Alex’s passion for entrepreneurship has driven him to find creative ways to address “pain points” for customers.  From mobile app development to inflatable breakfast food floats, Alex has remained focused on solving complex consumer problems, creating efficient channels within organizations and racking up lots of air miles and hotel points along the way. For fun, he likes to travel, hike, and spend time with his wife Gabi and dog Georgia.  He also enjoys a good craft IPA.Niko CangemiNiko Cangemi is on his 3rd successful venture with Aeri.

<h3>Tinkering for the best multi-tool to take on your ride </h3>
<p>In winter 2020, goofing around in the snow, Dani brought up the idea of solving the multi-tool problem cyclists face once and for all. So we started thinking about it. Especially Dani, the tinkerer among us, occasionally called MacGyver, couldn't get the challenge out of his head. Every minute his wife and kids were busy or sleeping, he tossed around the perfect bike multi-tool problem. </p>

We are back with our fourth Indiegogo - Kickstarter campaign after delivering thousands of bags successfully on time! We surveyed our backers and asked about the new functions that they'd like to see on our bags. After eight months of hard work and dozens of prototypes, we are very excited to share our new campaign with you. Introducing the backpack style !!Now, you will be able to carry your Moose laptop bag as a backpack without having any extra straps! We added a rectangular ring on the side so with the current shoulder strap, you will be able to convert the shoulder bag into a backpack whenever you want to. This was one of the most requested feature and it really works well now as a backpack too.    Laptop compartment fits up to 16"" laptopsUSB port's connector cable is located in this pocket. It is 30"" long so you can attach it to your own power bank or laptop.  It looks slim but fits a lot!   We are here to raise enough funds to bring Moose Designs bag to life.

Each 400 square-foot glass pyramid gives you a new way to experience nature with 360° desert views and absolute privacy with Smart Glass Technology.Just a short flight or a few hours drive from Las Vegas, Phoenix, or Flagstaff, Nomad’s Pad makes the perfect getaway for both long weekends and week-long expeditions to America’s greatest natural wonder. Nomad’s Pad is surrounded by 20 acres of undeveloped land in the rural town of Grand Canyon Junction—just a 25-minute drive from the Grand Canyon itself. From waking up with the sun to stargazing from bed, this one-of-a-kind experience has all the modern comforts of a hotel while giving you unhindered access to the magical Arizona desert.Each of the 10 temperature-controlled pyramids comes with a self-sufficient attachment of outdoor amenities to let you indulge in the outdoors hassle-free.During your stay, you become part of the Wild West. Hear birds chirping in the morning, coyotes howling at night, and the whistle of the wind blowing. Smell the fresh aroma of Pinyon Trees and Juniper Berries—like a refreshing glass of gin without the bite, just pure nature. At Nomad’s Pad, you can sleep with the night sky as your ceiling or take an afternoon nap with a backdrop of desert views without sacrificing privacy or comfort.When you step out into a beautiful desert landscape, you don’t want to walk into a hotel and shut yourself away. You want to stay in it, and be there—in the moment. Nomad’s Pad is built to be just that — a place where you can unwind, escape in nature, and stay there as part of it.We took a boutique approach to our accommodations, meaning fewer units that are more spaced out, so you get unobstructed views of the surrounding natural beauty.The pyramids are also designed with Smart Glass technology that turns the clear glass walls opaque at the touch of a button.Smart Glass gives you instant control over your privacy and experience. Keep the glass clear for those daytime Instagram photos and midnight stargazing, then switch on the privacy frost when it’s time to finally unwind. Mother Nature can be pretty unforgiving in a desert environment, which is why each pyramid has UV-resistant glass and air conditioning to shelter you from those hot summer days or brisk autumn nights.Enjoy the outdoors as much as you can while you’re here, and know that you have a cozy shelter to come back to once you’re done. Hi, we’re Victor and Jenny Pegeanu, and Nomad’s Pad isn’t our first rodeo with creating desert accommodations.After months of planning and preparing, we have everything in place to make Nomad’s Pad a reality. We’ve already done soil testing, traffic studies, fire hazard mitigation, gray water system blueprints, and more! We hired the most qualified team of engineers and builders that specialize in creating eco-friendly properties and they are ready to get started.Our permit is approved, so we have the green light to start building this thing—all we need now is your support!  Traditional outdoor experiences, like camping, can leave you worrying about the little things, which is why at Nomad’s Pad, we make your relaxation our first priority.We’ve partnered with local businesses as passionate as we are who can share the full spirit of Arizona with you. We’ve got you covered from food to fitness. At Nomad’s Pad, weekends mean live music and campfires under the stars. Local musicians perform acoustic, indie, psychedelic rock and more by the campfire so you can enjoy the outdoors with some added ambiance.(see Add-On section at bottom of page for more details) Meals at Nomad’s Pad will keep you feeling full, fresh, and re-freshed. Not only is it our mission to bring people closer to nature—we want to preserve it, too! When you stay with us, you put your personal health and wellness hand-in-hand with the wellness of the environment around you.A stay at Nomad’s Pad Grand Canyon is a 100% off-grid experience with everything powered by solar energy. The Pyramids are constructed with the passive house principles for maximum efficiency and lower carbon footprints.Take Highway 64 up to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon to experience the beauty of one of America’s most revered Natural Wonders.Most Grand Canyon visitors don’t make it past the developed enclave of Grand Canyon Village, but the close proximity of Nomad’s Pad starts you right at the canyon’s doorstep, helping you dig into all the park has to offer.Feeling the call of the wild is a sensation as old as humanity, but for those who have ever been intimidated by camping gear, specialized clothing, and technical know-how, getting out and experiencing it might have always felt out of reach.Making the rejuvenating beauty of nature accessible for everyone is what drives us, because we understand that the grind of a 9-5 can damage our spiritual connection to the Earth and to ourselves.It’s why we left our day jobs and started Nomad’s Pad in the first place—we weren’t satisfied letting our skills and knowledge grow without nurturing our dreams and desires. Lock down your spot by backing our live Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign.

<p><strong>Thank you, thank you, thank you!</strong></p>
<p>We were delighted to smash our target within the first 48 hours. We will use the $3,500/£2,500 to secure the production slot to manufacturer the minimum volume production run of our trademarked design Chilli WearTM Cooling Cap.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>… but we’re not done yet. </strong>We have big plans and love your input so far.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now that we have hit our 100% funded target <strong>we are adding a stretch goal of $25,000/£20,000 to scale up our production volumes </strong>and test some new product innovations around sizing and finishing - all suggested by our early bird Indiegogo backers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We’ve also introduced a referral programme</strong> to recognise and reward those backers who are showing their love on Social Media and sharing Chilli WearTM with their friends and family, </p>

<h2><strong>How it works</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Of all organs, the brain is probably the most vulnerable to heat. Plus, if you like wearing a baseball cap when you're out in the hot weather this can actually delay your body's ability to regulate temperature and ultimately cool down.</p>
<p>Applying cold water or ice to strategic points on the body where the veins are close to the surface — such as the forehead, temples, wrists, neck and chest — can quickly lower the temperature of the blood running through these veins. This allows the body to feel cooler. </p>
<p>This is how our Chilli Wear Cooling Cap works. Our trademarked design features a fully insulated pocket at the front of the cap to house our medical-grade, gel-pack which can be frozen (or chilled) in advance. The insultated pocket keeps the gel-pack cool while holding it in place, close to your veins, to help your body feel cooler.</p>
<p>Feel the difference in 3 simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Place your gel-packs in the freezer and let them chill (if you're out and about you can cool them by placing in a glass or bowl of ice water)</li>
<li>When the gels are cold and you are ready to feel the benefit, pop the gel-pack in the Cooling Cap (within the fully insulated pocket) and put it on</li>
<li>It provides an instant and refreshing change in temperature for your head, helping you to keep cooler for longer</li>

<h3>How we got here</h3>
<p>Chilli Wear™ was founded in 2019 by David Currie and Gary Melbourne. David, a health and sport professional, spends most of his time keeping active, outdoors. Gary, a contractor spends a lot of the year working outdoors. They bonded over their mutual love and equal frustration with baseball caps. The hat of choice made them even hotter when they were working and exercising. Surely there was an opportunity there?</p>
<p>Their vision was to create a product that would provide all of the lightweight, shade and comfort of a regular baseball cap while also providing the additional benefit of heating or cooling as the environment and activity required.</p>
<p>Two years in development and testing, to marry the concept of heat/cool insulation with comfort, lightweight and style - they are finally ready to share Chilli Wear™ with the rest of the world.</p>

<p>On their journey, they have received some valuable insight and support from a very small team. Each brings something unique, from Annie Melbourne, aged 8 who created the brand name, to Maria Sze, a brand and communications strategist working with start-ups.

<p>However, we need to raise funds in order to commission a full manufacturing run of our trademarked design, Chilli Wear™ Cooling Cap.

<p>We have crafted our perk structure to reward as many backers as possible with our existing, production samples of our Chilli Wear™ Cooling Caps. The first 1,000 units are here and ready to ship to backers in August.</p>
<p>Don't let the UK/£ put you off. Our perks are available to all markets from United States to Uzbekistan. All live perks are ready to convert to your local currency and ship NOW.</p>

Thank you, thank you, thank you!
We were delighted to smash our target within the first 48 hours. We will use the $3,500/£2,500 to secure the production slot to manufacturer the minimum volume production run of our trademarked design Chilli WearTM Cooling Cap.  
 
… but we’re not done yet. We have big plans and love your input so far.
 
Now that we have hit our 100% funded target we are adding a stretch goal of $25,000/£20,000 to scale up our production volumes and test some new product innovations around sizing and finishing - all suggested by our early bird Indiegogo backers.
 
We’ve also introduced a referral programme to recognise and reward those backers who are showing their love on Social Media and sharing Chilli WearTM with their friends and family,

Ensuring more than enough storage for your day trip essentials. Optional Dry Goods TraySay sayonara to soggy buns because each and every one of our coolers is compatible with our dry goods trays, perfect for keeping your contents cold, without running the risk of drowning your precious cargo. Ballistic NylonMade from the same ballistic nylon that was used to make flak jackets in WWII. Providing durability and strength proven through the test of time.

 1. Arnitel ECO by DSM  is currently half bio-based produced by using rapeseed oil. In the future, it can be completely made of renewable content.2. Polypropylene and Polyethylene can potentially be produced by using renewables.3. Closed-loop recyclability means that the material can be recycled to the same quality product or upcycled to a different product with higher demands.4. TPE-E is a highly recyclable type of polymer. Arnitel ECO was granted a Cradle To Cradle certification in 2013.5. We have used the LCA database of Delft University of Technology. It can be easily accessed via the IDEMAT app.6. The carbon footprint of raw polymers can be significantly reduced in the near future by increasing the plant-derived content.7. The carbon footprint of raw bottle glass is low - about 1.10 CO2 Equiv. / kg but usually glass bottles weigh 5-6 times more than plastic ones. Hence, the total footprint of glass is several times higher.

 DiFOLD Origami Bottle is the flagship product that comes from our collapsible design technology and together with you, as a powerful community, we aim to create a new perspective for REUSE. We call it a REFOLD Revolution! Its goal is to redefine the packaging industry by bringing REUSE & FOLDABILITY in a new generation of foldable and more practical reusable products. Imagine the milkman model from the past but in a modern context. Packaging never becomes waste and is simply reused, refilled and refold. We believe we can add value to modern-day milkman models and zero waste shopping by developing collapsible packaging that is convenient for carrying and refilling in-store or we can develop larger collapsible containers that are more sustainable and efficient for the transport of bulk goods.  The perfect business-tech duo, Radina & Petar started working together in March 2018 and since then they've walked a long journey in creating the DiFOLD Origami Bottle while also exploring the bigger potential and impact of the design technology in the packaging world. PETAR ZAHARINOV - inventor & product designer. An architect by education but truly and inventor and innovator by heart. He has been a product designer for the last 10 years and some of his creations include the creative puzzle furniture Praktrik and the innovative modular wall system WallStack.  Petar is a Platinum A’Design Award Winner and his projects have been featured in WIRED, Designboom,  Fast Company, The Verge аnd other leading business and tech media outlets. RADINA POPOVA - business developer & marketeer.  Outspoken go-getter and never giving up, not surprisingly her passion is rock climbing. Her driving principles are: ""Always add value and be of value to people. Make an impact while taking care of the world"". She has a solid experience in business and brand development, working for the ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi and for startups in Berlin and Barcelona. Also, one of the founders at WallStack.  Pitching for the development of reusable packaging for the retailer ALDI. 
 
 The last two years we’ve spent in Research & Development of DiFOLD’s design technology and creating the Origami Bottle as our flagship product. We have covered the whole process from conceptualising, 3D modelling and prototyping to pre-production and injection-molding, testing all of the details that would ensure the best bottle performance and user experience.

<p>We recommend using a knife model that has either a wood saw, metal saw (file), scissors, or an awl as these four tools work the best, but the FireAnt will work with any of these pictured tools:</p>

</div></div>","This campaign has ended but the FireAnt is available NOW on our website. Come visit us and see all of our unique gear at  tortoisegear.com
 The FireAnt is a patented aftermarket accessory designed by Tortoise Gear for use with the Swiss Army knife.What is the FireAnt and why are we making it?Everyone loves a good Swiss Army knife - they are an icon of quality and utility wrapped up in a small and easy to carry package!  But let's face it, unless you're an alcoholic who only opens wine bottles with your Swiss Army knife, the corkscrew really is a tool with limited to no use. Until now...
  The FireAnt is a custom sparking-steel fire starting tool designed to integrate with the corkscrew tool on Swiss Army knives. Every FireAnt will come with one Helix tinder. The FireAnt and Helix tinder transform the corkscrew into one of the most useful tools you can possibly have on a Swiss Army knife!   Oh, and you can keep your toothpick... The FireAnt adds firepower, a splash of color and glow to your Swiss Army knife instantly without any required modifications! A perfect micro fire starter for EDC! The FireAnt is a complete fire starter integrated within the corkscrew so ZERO extra pocket bulk is added AND at less than one gram it weighs almost nothing, yet it's waterproof and can start hundreds of fires!
  Just say NO to bulky pockets!Unlike other fire starters FireAnt adds ZERO extra pocket bulk
  Design Features.Every feature of the FireAnt is carefully engineered to increase utility. 
Fluted design helps create a strong visual impact. 

Not your ordinary firesteel:  The FireAnt will use the same proprietary formula that we developed for our Firefly fire starters.  This is NOT your ordinary sparking steel, it is superior in every way!  It is easy to spark and anti corrosive and it has a lower hardness so it is much less brittle and puts far less wear on your knife tools.   
 Colors that GLOW:  We plan to make the FireAnt in three different neon color tops: Orange, Blue, and Yellow-Green, each with a color complimented sparking steel.  These colors are bright and can be spotted easily if the FireAnt is dropped. AND THEY GLOW!  Each color will have it's own unique all-night glow color so you can easily locate your knife at night! Easy to see, especially in low-light conditions.
  Anti-corrosion coating: The sparking steel on every FireAnt will be coated with it's own color complimented anti-corrosion coating.  This paired with a low corrosive steel makes the FireAnt very resistant to any corrosion.  If it gets wet or goes through the washing machine it's no big deal.Corrosion resistant coating
   Helix Tinder Included- Every FireAnt comes with one Helix Tinder.  Helix Tinder is a custom extruded waxed cotton tinder designed to integrate into the corkscrew with the FireAnt. Helix Tinder is waterproof and blended with special additives to increase the melt temperature so it won't melt in your pocket.  Helix Tinder also has a low flash point so it ignites easily even with very small sparks, this helps to prolong the life of your FireAnt fire starter.   One Helix Tinder can be used all at once for a large hot fire lasting up to 2 minutes or a small piece can be cut off preserving the rest for later.  When separated or cut into 4 pieces each piece can burn for up to 1 minute.    One Helix Tinder pulled into four pieces. Helix Tinder is waterproof so it is a very effective fire starter even in very bad conditions.Helix Tinder is waterproof!This is no gimmick, FireAnt means business!Wet hands, wet tinder, wet fire starter, wet knife, wet ground, submerged gear, rain, snow, sleet... no problem.  The FireAnt and Helix Tinder combination just works! We want to make sure everyone knows the FireAnt fire starter and tinder is a real survival tool that means business, check out this video.
 

 FireAnt makes a great accessory.

Nutshell packs flat to half its width so you can store it away in the closet, under the couch, or in the trunk of your car!  Nutshell kept ice frozen for more than 48 hours in our tests, outperforming the Yeti Hopper Two, Coleman Excursion, Styrofoam, and several other coolers in identical conditions. There are many variables that affect ice retention including contents of the cooler, ratio of ice, original ice temperature, type of ice (crushed, block, cube), ambient temperature, exposure to direct sunlight, etc. Therefore, we can't tell you exactly how long ice will last inside your Nutshell, but we can tell you it will last longer than it would have inside most plastic alternatives. We designed Nutshell with Box Clever, the sustainable design studio behind category-defining products like Nebia showers, Caraway cookware, and Away luggage. Carrying your cooler shouldn't be a workout. Use the comfortable side handles or shoulder strap to take Nutshell wherever you go.  Nutshell holds enough food and drinks to keep everyone fed and refreshed. It even fits wine bottles! Check out all the stuff you can fit in a Nutshell (including room for plenty of ice):Nutshell’s removable, leakproof welded liner makes cleaning a breeze. Rinse it with water and mild soap and let it dry before storing. Pack your essentials in the two side pockets, or use the hidden D-rings as additional attachment points for your keys and more! Unclip the front of your Nutshell and use it as a tabletop surface. Great for picnics at the park and at the beach!The colors are inspired by the Philippines, where tropical beaches meet warm waters and deep lagoons.The Nutshell Ice Pack is made with recycled polyester and ships empty to minimize carbon emissions. You can easily fill it with water or a salt water mixture at home and freeze it before use. Empty the water after your trip and fold it away, or keep your ice pack full in the freezer, ready for your next adventure. Get it for 33% OFF!Nutshell Coolers are insulated with coconut husk fiber, a waste product of the coconut industry.The husk of a coconut is a natural marvel: it protects the water inside, keeping it cool in the heat and safe when it falls. But it’s nothing more than waste for farmers. Billions of leftover husks are burned every year, producing unhealthy smoke and releasing tons of CO2 into the atmosphere.We spent years working alongside farmers and engineers in the Philippines, turning this waste into insulation for the Nutshell Cooler.  Our natural materials offer the supernatural technical performance expected of top outdoor gear. Coconut husk fibers are hollow and contain tons of tiny trapped air pockets--the same exact structure that plastic foam insulation uses to reduce heat transfer (i.e. conduction). In fact, if you compare Expanded Polystyrene foam (EPS, a.k.a. Styrofoam) and coconut fiber side by side under a microscope, you’ll hardly see a difference. Yet every cooler brand, and almost every outdoor gear company, relies on polluting plastic foam insulation without thinking twice about it. Nutshell proves that there's a better choice, and a growing Nutshell community forces the industry to take notice. Where we can't eliminate synthetics, we source upcycled and recycled textiles that complement our natural insulation. Nutshell’s water-repellent shell and leakproof liner are made with top-of-the-line materials.Nutshell is water resistant thanks to a PFC-free PU coating to protect your stuff from the weather. We chose a 600D recycled fabric and coated webbing for long-term durability.RF-welded seams eliminate stitching and provide a leakproof interior liner made of 100% recycled polyester. Our sturdy metal hook keeps everything sealed and safe inside your Nutshell.Hidden D-rings for the shoulder strap offer additional attachment points for keys, bottle openers, and other essentials.Use the bottom closure latch to fold your Nutshell into a neat package and store it away until your next adventure. As easy as 1,2,3!By using leftover coconut husks that would otherwise be burned, every Nutshell Cooler prevents CO2 emissions and unhealthy smoke. Nutshell is designed to last years, not millennia. Nutshell Coolers are made tough so you can enjoy them on countless adventures for years to come. And our design and material choices are grounded in circularity: Nutshell insulation is biodegradable and useful as mulch or plant root protection at the end of its insulating life. The coconut fiber insulation is accessible via internal pockets to separate the degradable and recycled components of your Nutshell Cooler. We source leftover coconut husks from small-scale farmers in the Philippines.

Your sports bag, your jacket, and even attach to your keychain. Perfect match for any indoor or outdoor activities. It’s in-interesting that your buddy finds out you’re carrying such a mini but functional cool stuff.  This amazing design is made of signature black aerospace aluminum or solid ultra -tough titanium. YSMART 2.0 not only looks great, but is practically unbreakable.   The main piece of feedback we received from YSMART 1.0 was that the flashlight itself has a magnetic base, but you need to twist it to turn it on and off—so while practical and useful, at times it wasn’t as convenient as it could be.  So, we went back to the drawing board to determine how we could provide a solution to this feedback. How could we improve on YSMART 1.0 ? Make it easy to detach, with automatic on/off! And so, the YSMART 2.0 quick-release auto-lighting mechanism was born. We spent a year on research and development, refining our designs until we landed on the design you see today. SPECIFICATIONSWeight: Titanium- 12g / Aluminum- 8g Width: 1cm Length: 3cm Materials: Premium Aerospace Grade Aluminum Alloy / Grade 5 Titanium Battery: LR41/AG3 Button Cell （NOT INCLUDE）Type of Bulb: Micro SMD LED 2.0",23.0,0,"6 Campaigns

With that in mind we are not naive enough to believe we have it all figured out, and keep our perspectives alert and open to the potential of unplanned changes throughout this process. From what we learned, we've done everything possible to streamline the process on our end.

<p>As avid outdoor users and inhabitants of this planet we want to take the best care of it we can. We're realistic, though - we ARE starting an apparel brand.

<p><strong>MADE-TO-ORDER MANUFACTURING</strong><br/>Our radically different supply chain means we only make what we need.

THE MAXIMALISTAll the bells and all the whistles. With the Maximalist you can get anything and everything you have ever wanted out of your shell.







 
COLOUR (not a typo, we're Canadian)Ideally, we would have every colour anybody wants, but we still need to order fabrics and meet minimum orders, so we need to be smart about it. 

Here is a breakdown of the fabric and zipper colours available for the campaign perks. Just envision your new jacket designed with the exact look you want!  
 

WHO WE ARE

CAPRI PHILIP  |  Co-Founder, DesignLoves fishing, hasn’t yet caught anything.Capri’s lifelong pursuit of knowledge in patternmaking, design, and development coupled with her passion for snowboarding, skiing, biking, and climbing has led to a career designing for leaders in the market including the past six years at Arc’teryx. She is driven to design the best performing, most sustainable gear on the planet.

CHERYL LEBARR  |  Co-Founder, DevelopmentPlayed young Annie Oakley in a local figure skating production at age 7. Adorable, eh?Cheryl got her start at 15 in a little outdoor shop on the Sunshine Coast, leading to a lifelong obsession with high quality outdoor gear. After mastering her craft at university and working for stellar outdoor brands including Arc’teryx, she is now focused on creating premium, personalized, custom gear.

DUSTIN BUTCHER  |  Co-Founder, BrandWho invited him? He’s not even Canadian.Born and raised at the foot of the Wasatch mountains of Utah, Dustin is deeply connected to the outdoors and skiing. During his professional career he has had the opportunity to work in-house and as a creative agency lead for some powerhouse brands in the outdoor industry including G3, Petzl, Gregory Packs, Pret Helmets, and others.

RISKS & CHALLENGES
We have been hard at work developing our systems and processes, but we don't yet know what we don't know. Our expert team has been in the industry for a long time, but anytime you introduce a change like this you are bound to run into some challenges. As we come across these challenges we will be fully transparent with our backers and solve them in a way that leaves you happy and proud to support our company.
Supply Chain Risk: We are kinda shaking things up here, but we are working with trusted partners in our software, manufacturing, shipping, customs logistics, and every other piece of the puzzle. But even the experts aren't immune to weather, port congestion, and other uncontrollable factors.
Whatever happens, we'll get through it together and keep you in the loop the whole time.",37.0,2,"1 Campaign

With this rugged open-air companion, your distinctiveness and toughness can’t be boasted more!  Inspired by the Iron Man, PATRIOT PRO stands for stronger power propelled by a 1500W motor and futuristic design of the biometric bike lock.  You’ll feel like riding on a wild beast that can take you wherever you wanna go wildly and freely. Speedy acceleration with fat tries 26X3.0 inch forms the robust and reliable adventures, much tougher to handle the rigorous demands of the roads. Wherever it leads you, it stays exactly yours. Your strong personality just got to be matched up with this strong bike!      The 1500W motor supplies this wild electric bike with beefy power to get your heart racing. It boosts the ride at a top speed of 31 miles per hour that gives you the pure enjoyment of speed and power.  Feel free to ride uphill, downhill or even stairs with full speed hands down. All the speed, all the fun!   Advanced built-in fingerprint recognition device doubles the safety and convenience of keeping your PATRIOT.  With a touch of your fingerprint on the sensor, the bike is locked and unlocked automatically. Gone are the days of bringing the key or cable lock for this smart keyless access.  Not only can this anti-theft system store your fingerprint but a few more of those you share this bike with so that multiple cyclists can be allowed to use it safely. Enjoy this exclusivity that just belongs to you, your friends and family members!   The elaborate truss structure of PATRIOT renders larger strength to withstand more heavy and dynamic loads. The truss outlook not only shows off its unique and aesthetic shape but fulfills challenging missions whatever it can be for its amazing load-bearing capacity. See the beauty in this beast and feel the sturdiness it gives.   PATRIOT isn't only a powerful electric bike but a very comfortable one to ride on as we have both front and rear suspension, which will absorb most of the shocks on the road. This not only gives you a more enjoyable ride but also lets you ride at a high speed without much frequency of braking. Comfort throughout the ride is never sacrificed!   26X3.0 inch fat tires provide maximum contact in any road condition for optimum traction and steadiness.  Instead of adopting 4-inch fat tires that are heavier, 3-inch fat tires are just right for easier control to deliver faster speed and complete the missions of the fusion of an MTB and a road bike like PATRIOT. Dirt, grass, gravel, and city streets are easily conquered with these exceptional tires, adding comfort and skid resistance to riding.    Located in the center and integrated with the frame, there’s no extra space taken for its Samsung battery 48V 14.5Ah battery, looking stealthy and stylish. Moreover, it is removable for easy charging.  Lithium battery has the best combination of total weight and capacity. Charging for 4-6 hours to get the battery fully charged and you’re ready to hit the road!     We got 3 stunning colors to turn heads: Illuminating Yellow / Navy Blue/USA Flag Colors. You can choose the tone of color you want for your Patriot Pro to show your distinctiveness and personality.  Be bright, be cool and be trendy.   PATRIOT comes with both thumb throttle and pedal-assist for superb propulsion. If pedaling is not for you, push the throttle on the left.  You can choose either of the modes or, in combination at your discretion.  The max. speed can be up to 31 mph by throttle and 20mph by pedal assist. Coupled with Shimano 7 speed gears adapted to rough conditions as well as hydraulic disc brakes, PATRIOT PRO delivers an unprecedented smooth ride for you on varying terrains with perfect assistance from the firm and safe stopping power.  Riding data presented on the colorful LCD in sync wherever you go.  Come be the master of this unmatched all-around beast!    Being a big fan of Iron Man, we got inspired by its tough outlook and the bright heart at the center.  The smart biometric lock presents the high-tech feature.

We proudly can say it is made of 99.9% pure copper.Additionally copper has very unique visual features.  Its surface will gain some patina layer over the time that adds personal characteristics to your NUKE.  
 
 Using SAFE NUKE will help you to avoid direct contact from dirty public surfaces. However, we suggest to wash it as frequently as your hands. It is made of very durable materials - copper body with stylus nib and US-made paracord. You can wash it with water and soap or disinfect with hand sanitizer. Don't be the one who comes into contact with all the dirt, let the SAFE NUKE do it.
 
 
 Each Nuke is CNC machined and finished in our own workshop which makes us fully independent from outsource manufacturers. We pay special attention to every single detail because that's what builds quality. We have gone through a lot of prototyping processes to achieve the perfect end result. You can check a few of our early prototypes below.EARLY PROTOTYPES OF THE SAFE NUKE We offer two surface finishes for the SAFE NUKE. You can choose between satin matte finish achieved by smooth brushing or mirror polished surface. Both look very nice and compliment each other. ParacordsWe offer three paracord designs: black, red and camo style.
    TIMELINEOUR TEAMWe are a CNC machining workshop established 4 years ago and owned by three friends. It is our passion to create pocket size everyday carry gadgets that make our life easier and a bit more fun at the same time. We believe that Indiegogo is the perfect place for us to offer you our latest creation and we truly believe you will love it✌️",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>The ROTO-Q 360 is a Money-saving Appliance</strong></h3>
<p><strong><i><span><span>The ROTO-Q 360 has achieved perfection in cooking the rotisserie cousins while cutting down cooking time by as much as 30%. Since the ROTO-Q 360 brings down the cooking time, energy expenditure is also less which in turn saves your money. Plus, as the ROTO-Q 360 can do all the work, you don’t have to pay for other machines that may make your beautiful kitchen counter look crowded. Thus, you save money again.</span></span> </i></strong></p>
<p>Traditional methods of rotisserie cooking require industrial-style appliances with electric driven motors. These devices are much more expensive (ranging from $250-$600) also not portable and take up a large amount of space in your kitchen not to mention the loud noise created from the fan and motors making cooking experience unpleasant.</p>
<p>Furthermore, cooking chicken in a crockpot or tray by roasting or baking takes a long time to prep 5-6 hours, and sometimes leaves it uncooked or soggy from the bottom side. ROTO-Q 360 will never cause this problem because it cooks the food from all sides through its 360 degrees rotating mechanism. So there is no need for adjusting, stirring or flipping in the middle of cooking, and no more rubbing more butter or oil.  A rotisserie chicken is likely to be moisture than one that has simply been roasted in the oven.</p>

This is our 11th campaign here on Indiegogo. We have shipped thousands of products to backers in over 110 countries.We are thrilled to introduce you to our latest creations.  Jumble-Free Jetting is HereRoad warriors rejoice: Stash V2 is here. Based on feedback from our original Stash backers and customer we have designed the ultimate upscale electronics bag that helps you keep all those dongles, drives, cables and connectors under control. Stash is stylish, compact and designed to perfectly fit all those small items that keep our personal and work life ticking. Below are some of Stash's cool and innovative features:Stay-Open DesignStash's unique design is meant to optimize storage and accessibility. One of its key features is the rigid stay-vertical mid section. Both sides provide options to store items of various shapes and sizes. The design also makes it easy to find what you need when you need it without having to fumble around. A Loop For All SizesHow does Stash securely fit all these odd shapes and sizes? Stash features a unique adjustable storage system that allows you to create custom loops for all your multi-sized gadgets. Everything will have a place that fits so your gear doesn't slash around inside your bag.Built-in Pencil TrayBall-point pens, ink pens, sketch pens, permeant markers, marker pens, stylus we all carry some of these with us and they seemed to be programmed to get lost at the worst times. We have you covered, Stash's magnetic shelves is the perfect place to store them. Its flexible mesh will expand to hold your growing collection. It is designed to be easy to see into and find what you are looking for.Flexi-Pockets For All The Odd SizesOne needs a mouse when one needs a mouse.. a dedicated pocket to fit one of those and another of similar size that can fit an Apple power adapter or something similarly sized. Large Flat Power Banks/Portable Drives Have a Place TooCarry around a batter pack for those just-in-case situations? Or a portable hard drive? Stash's large flat pockets are perfect for those.  The flat pocket completely collapses when not in use so you don't waste that space.Top-notch QualitySpecifications    A Dopp-Kit but betterWe are big fans the easy accessibility of traditional dopp-kit design. One main zipper to access everything inside the bag makes it very easy to pack and get into. What we didn't like so much so much is the lack organization and visibility. The one big section means all your toiletries and accessories are all jumbled up. The lack of visibility can make the problem even harder. So we design the Doppler.. we are sure Charles Doppelt (inventor of the original Dopp-kit, would approve).Stay-Open DesignThe two halves of the Doppler opens 180 degrees, the magnets under each can hold it open flat so you can see and access everything inside. Organization Without CompromiseMultiple pockets in a variety of shapes help you well organize everything for small tweezers to full sized toothpaste. Everything has its place. When open, every one of those pockets are visible and easily accessible. So you get all of the organization without any of the hassle.Look Ma.. NO ZippersThe Doppler features a lot of pockets to help you organize and keep your shaver away from your toothbrush. And is the really cool bit, Doppler's unique design ensures that everything stays inside its pockets when closed, so even without any zippers, you will find your stuff exactly where you put it.Toothbrush PocketThe middle, ## cms long, toothbrush pocket serve two purpose. The inside of the pocket is lined with waterproof material making it easy to wipe down and keep dry. The pocket can also be used to hold your toothbrush in an upright position to allow it to dry between uses.4 Mid-sided PocketsStore your mid sized toiletries, adapters etc. in one of 4 midsized pockets (# cms X # cms).  6 Small Pockets For Everything Else6 small pockets to fit all your small essentials be it eye drops, lip balms, clippers, floss and so on, now you have place for everything.2 Large/Long PocketsThese large pockets on both sides can easily fit your shaver or even a large sized tube of toothpaste.

While sitting on a beach in Bali (Indonesia), I grew fed up with hiding my valuables in the sand every time I wanted to get in the water. My wallet would get full of sand, my cards would get scratched, notes would get wet and there were even times I forgot where my hiding spot was. So I decided to do something about it. Bringing together cutting-edge waterproof technology and sustainable materials in an ultra-secure - yet sleek - design, I’m excited to introduce: Submerge - The Adventure Wallet & Card Holder. The Perfect Companion For Every Adventure  No matter what your passion, no matter how extreme your adventure, Submerge gives you complete peace of mind. A compact card holder for your cash, cards and keys, coupled with a sleek waterproof wallet ensures complete security and protection for your valuables, strapped securely on your arm at all times, no matter what. Never Leave Your Valuables Behind Ever Again Traditional wallets aren’t designed to be carried in the ocean or exposed to the elements - Submerge is. Whether you’re out in the water or up a mountain peak, there are some things that just can’t be left behind. Forget about leaving your car keys, house keys, credit cards or cash lying about at risk of theft or loss… Take them with you and get on with what you love doing. Whatever you do, wherever you go, Submerge will be right there with you.  The Submerge Wallet 
Extra strong, durable, and 100% waterproof (ipx8 standard)
Quick-drying outer layer
Multiple ways to safely secure to your body and clothing, suitable for any activity. Waist strap attachment also available as a product Add On.
Silky-smooth feel and discreet design
Full detachable and adjustable strap - so that the wallet can be wearable or can fit snug in your pocket
Can be attached to a carabiner to cling to your trousers - therefore avoiding pickpockets on your travels
Fully secure strap that will not fall off - the velcro that we’ve used is secured twice
It can be submerged up to a depth of 3m. It can be fully submerged underwater.
   Submerge Card Holder 
Holds up to 10 cards, with plenty of space for cash and keys
Hidden pockets for those items that don’t need to be on show
Can be used on it’s own as an all-round wallet solution (no need to keep swapping cards around!)
As minimalist as viably possible (we know how annoying it is to have a clunky leather wallet)
Use with the Submerge Wallet or on its own.
Made from high quality elastic and Vegan-approved faux suede, the Submerge card holder holds up to 10 cards across three divided sections, with two hidden pockets for notes, coins and keys.
Lightweight, sleek, and small enough to fit inside any pocket. It is as small as we could have possibly made it - it is the size of a credit card.
  Unparalleled Design, Ready For The Elements  WALLET A perfect companion for any outdoor activity. Our pocket-less pouch is built of TPU with a YKK airtight waterproof zipper, ensuring that your valuables stay dry at all times. Run in the rain, swim in the ocean, climb up a mountain. Whatever your activity of choice, just strap your wallet to your arm and you’re good to go. Even if you’re at a waterpark with the kids and don’t want to stop off in the locker rooms every 20 minutes to buy them an ice cream, submerge is for you! Completely submersible - up to a depth of 3m Use a carabiner to attach your Submerge Wallet to your pants or equipment Product Add-Ons Once you've selected your reward above, you will have the option to add on any of the following add-ons at a special Kickstarter price. Available exclusively to backers only. Submerge Logo Tote BagPerfect for the beach or a day by the river.  Submerge Waist StrapSimilar to the arm band, but bigger...  We have designed a strap for our Waterproof Wallet that you can attach around your waist or leg.  2 x CarabinerPerfect for attaching your Submerge Wallet to your belt buckle or climbing/camping gear.  SOS Floating WhistleMade to attach to your wallet and attract the attention of others on your adventures.  Credit Card Sized RFID BlockerWe will provide two cards, one for either side of your Submerge Cardholder.

The Submerge wallet is truly durable.)  Hi - I’m Ronan...I created Submerge to solve a very real problem that we all face:Keeping our valuables safe while submerging ourselves in activities! Thank YOU for putting your trust in us, it’s supporters like you who will help make Submerge the no.1 choice for adventurers when it comes to peace of mind. Ronan Finnegan, Founder @ Submerge I've been turning ideas into businesses since leaving school.

The chef-grade quality knives and full-size cutting board allow you to prepare meals without having to worry about carrying excess kitchen equipment with you. And the best part? We’ve kept everything sustainable! From the cutting board and case material to the wooden handles of the knife – everything is ethically sourced.   Reinvent outdoor cooking or simply maximize existing kitchen space with the Ultimate Dedfish knife/cutting board. Easily prepare fresh food with the tools you carry with you wherever you go. Think about it…When was the last time you took an actual cutting board outdoors and prepared your meal with ease? For far too long, we had to pack our kitchen knives with cardboard and duct-taped sheaths wrapped in sweatshirts, which we then stuffed into our gear bag. And that's why we created a cutting board that transforms into a case, so you can focus more on the meal prep and less on the tools while enjoying the outdoors. We needed a way to safely store our knives while carrying them with us wherever we went. With that goal in mind we developed this bamboo cutting board with a minimalist design packing maximum functionality to transport premium chef knives like never before. The best thing about this board is that it’s extremely durable, scratch-resistant, and lightweight. And that’s not all! This board folds in half and locks in place featuring an ultra-strong magnetic closing design. Oh, and guess what? Since it’s super compact it makes for a great organizer that saves space in the kitchen and makes outdoor cooking easier and more accessible. Knives that Cut Through Fruits, Vegetables, and Meat Like Butter Thanks to our highest quality Japanese Damascus & German Steel blades. Our knives offer amazing functionality and design so you get to slice through your food without any force. How? We source the highest quality steels and got help from the best knife smiths to ensure exceptional strength, durability, and stain resistance. With these knives, you get beauty and sophistication packed in one!We started Dedfish Co. 4 years ago with the only goal of equipping outdoor adventurers and meal preppers with the highest quality products at an affordable price.     Tested In The Outdoors and Vacation Destinations Across the Globe!For the past few years, we've taken the Dedfish set with us on the road, camping, and even to our Airbnb vacation destinations across the globe. We love to eat, we love to cook, and finding ourselves stuck with dull knives was less than ideal! We started a knife company, but carrying a knife across the globe is not easy! That is why we came up with the ultimate carry case/cutting board.Meal prep made easier - The world's most versatile cooking bundle has the most unique story!Dedfish came into being when two outdoor lovers, Blake & Mara, started venturing on adventures one after the other.

Take that, regular helmets:
Tear-proof, Water-proof fabric that looks & feels amazing. But wait! It’s hiding something...  
 

So how do you put lights on a helmet without making it look like sci-fi? You cover them up with a classy fabric liner. During the day you rock that fabric that looks & feels amazing. At night...the magic happens. 
 

 


Take FARO from Visibility to Visibility + Communication: let drivers and other riders know what you're up to!     
Why is this an add-on? 
Cycling is very different for everyone. The cycling infrastructure in your city, how experienced of a rider you are, your equipment...it all comes into play. We talked to over 300 riders from London, Copenhagen, L.A, Hong Kong & Berlin and their opinions on Turn Signals were split: many requested the feature while many others assured they wouldn’t use it.
Since we don’t want half of you guys stuck with (and paying for) an accessory you don’t want, we decided to make it an Add-on and as a bonus, make the helmet itself more affordable. 
 

 

 The FARO App allows detailed customization of FARO's light features and sensors.

EVO SHAVER has a Type-C USB port that you can charge it with a wall charger, power bank or even your laptop through a USB cable. So you don't have to worry about the battery dying wherever you go.

We successfully raised more than $165K on Indiegogo 1.5 years ago and all the perks were delivered to 4637 backers. We did our promise. And now, we start our second project — the EVO SHAVER — which is designed to meet Men’s shaving requirement while travel and for daily use. We greatly appreciate the support from our previous backers and give you our sincerest thanks for backing us. We hope you will continue to support us and help us achieve the goal again this time. Once again, thank you for supporting our dreams and being so amazing!

<p><strong>Adaptable bags designed for everyday use and for your weekend adventures. </strong></p>
<p>Afar &amp; Away was born in the Pacific Northwest. Our surroundings give us the inspiration for the products we make. Like many of you, we are curious, spontaneous and adventurous. We are passionate about designing gear that performs as well as it looks. We set out to create bags that are not only lightweight, minimal and durable, but can also expand and transform into an entirely different bag. We meticulously designed the DUPLEX Series bags to balance both form and function. These are bags that are purposely minimal, but packed with features. Our branding is subtle and our materials are modern and sleek. These bags look great and perform well in the city as well as in the outdoors.  A spontaneous hike, a trip to the store, or an overnighter, the DUPLEX bags will help you expand your horizons.</p>

<h3><strong>Pacific North West born. Made for the world. </strong></h3>
<p>We’ve spent over a year designing, prototyping &amp; field testing these bags in order to streamline their aesthetic, function and usability. They are now adventure ready and we can’t wait to share them with you. We are launching this campaign to help fund production of the bags and we are offering you a chance to purchase early and at a discount. </p>
<p>We appreciate your support and look forward to being a part of your journeys for years to come.</p>

<h3><strong>Adventure ready.</strong></h3>
<p>The <strong>DUPLEX ASCENT</strong> hip pack can be worn around the waist or as a sling. It has a large storage compartment with organizational pockets, a key ring and a front zippered pocket. It converts into a full-size backpack in a matter of seconds, quadrupling in size and carrying capacity. You still have access to all the hip pack storage as well. When converted to a backpack, you can still use the hip pack's waist belt to offload heavier loads, or stash it in the stowaway compartment. Access is easy with 2 large zippered compartments that are separated to keep items organized. It's also useful to keep dirty and clean items separated. A top compartment is accessed by dual zippers and has a divider for a small laptop or tablet. Carry more with two 4-way stretch pockets for water bottles or other items. These pockets feature cinch straps to help keep larger items in place or they are also a great for looping on extra items such as a hat. The front panel is perfect for stashing an extra jacket or it even holds a bike helmet.</p>

My idea for the DUPLEX SERIES bags was that they should still be useful once they are packed down. I started with the idea of making a backpack that could turn into another bag. It had to transform quickly and it had to be lightweight so you aren't carrying around too much extra heavy hardware or fabric. The bag it packs down to had to be highly useful on it's own as well.

</div></div>","Introducing the DUPLEX Series bags from Afar & Away
Built for life's adventures, even if it's not the one you planned. 

The DUPLEX ASCENT hip pack can be worn around the waist or as a sling. It has a large storage compartment with organizational pockets, a key clip and a front zippered pocket. It converts into a full-size backpack in a matter of seconds, quadrupling in size and carrying capacity. While in backpack mode, you still have access to all the hip pack storage as well.
 
The DUPLEX ROAM crossbody bag has 2 outside quick access pockets and a large zippered interior storage compartment. The dual-adjustable shoulder strap is padded and has a breathable mesh for comfort.  Access a hidden zipper on the bottom of the bag and transform this bag into a duffle bag in seconds. You now have over 5 times the storage capacity.
Adaptable bags designed for everyday use and for your weekend adventures. 
Afar & Away was born in the Pacific Northwest. Our surroundings give us the inspiration for the products we make. Like many of you, we are curious, spontaneous and adventurous. We are passionate about designing gear that performs as well as it looks. We set out to create bags that are not only lightweight, minimal and durable, but can also expand and transform into an entirely different bag. We meticulously designed the DUPLEX Series bags to balance both form and function. These are bags that are purposely minimal, but packed with features. Our branding is subtle and our materials are modern and sleek. These bags look great and perform well in the city as well as in the outdoors.  A spontaneous hike, a trip to the store, or an overnighter, the DUPLEX bags will help you expand your horizons.

Pacific North West born. Made for the world. 
We’ve spent over a year designing, prototyping & field testing these bags in order to streamline their aesthetic, function and usability. They are now adventure ready and we can’t wait to share them with you. We are launching this campaign to help fund production of the bags and we are offering you a chance to purchase early and at a discount. 
We appreciate your support and look forward to being a part of your journeys for years to come.



 

Converting the DUPLEX ASCENT from a hip pack to a backpack is quick and easy.


Adventure ready.
The DUPLEX ASCENT hip pack can be worn around the waist or as a sling. It has a large storage compartment with organizational pockets, a key ring and a front zippered pocket. It converts into a full-size backpack in a matter of seconds, quadrupling in size and carrying capacity. You still have access to all the hip pack storage as well. When converted to a backpack, you can still use the hip pack's waist belt to offload heavier loads, or stash it in the stowaway compartment. Access is easy with 2 large zippered compartments that are separated to keep items organized. It's also useful to keep dirty and clean items separated. A top compartment is accessed by dual zippers and has a divider for a small laptop or tablet. Carry more with two 4-way stretch pockets for water bottles or other items. These pockets feature cinch straps to help keep larger items in place or they are also a great for looping on extra items such as a hat. The front panel is perfect for stashing an extra jacket or it even holds a bike helmet.
Built for the Spontaneous.

of Aishu, the designer of FlameCube  . In 2015, I ventured out on a special journey by bike across the whole of China on my own. Over 9 months I traveled more than 13,000 miles across a majority of what you could describe as noman’s land such as large plateaus, snow land, deserts &amp; wilderness. It was really an amazing journey, but since most of the areas I passed were no-man's land, so most of the time I had no means to charge my phone, I couldn't film all those memorable scenes. And sometime there's no more power for navigation, I couldn't even call for help in an emergency. In the meantime, I have to carry a lot of supplies and equipments, makes the journey more difficult.</p><p>So in 2016, I started drafting up my plan for FlameCube mini. A lightweight camping stove for any adventurer or outdoor enthusiast like myself. After two years of hard work, our team finally made it a reality.

With this, the thermoelectric generator will turn the heat into electricity! Then use a portion of the electricity to power fans that helps the fire burn cleaner, hotter and keep making electricity.       The FlameCube mini / mini Pro’ size makes it perfect to fit in a bag, in the trunk or even carry. It's literally the size of an apple, and it weighs exactly what you'd expect it to.  FlameCube mini & mini Pro come equipped with 2400mah rechargeable battery. Both can charge your phone even without a live fire. The FlameCube mini Pro can use the thermal energy to re-charge the powerbank. Using an integrated USB port, you can power your USB devices, such as a USB LED light, a phone etc.  No matter what weather it is, no matter where you go, it will be ready at all times. The waterproof design makes sure that nothing can get into the electronics to ruin your FlameCube mini / mini Pro.   1, Easy to set: FlameCube mini/mini Pro is so easy to set up, simply just unfold the collapsible hem, lock in place and pull out the blue control module.   2, Touch control：The FlameCube mini/mini Pro offers three different wind speeds for different uses: Grilling, Boiling, Turbo. LED lights on the dashboard shows how much electricity remains.   3, Quick Charge：FlameCube mini & FlameCube mini Pro both come with the quick charge function, you can charge 80% of battery in 30 minutes, enough to last days.   4,Cookwares-sizes adapted: Rotatable pot holders allows it to fit cookwares in different sizes.   Scenario A: For FlameCube mini, when it runs out of battery, you can take down the control module and use it like a regular wood stove. Due to the unique industrial design, FlameCube mini, when it doesn't have a control module, can still have a good performance.Scenario B: For FlameCube mini, when twigs turn to charcoal, you can take down the control module and turn off the fans to save power and allow the remaining charcoal to burn.Scenario C: For FlameCube mini/mini Pro, remove the control module to make it easier to clean.  With two internal jets, FlameCube mini/ mini Pro can release more than 3KW of thermal power when the fire is on. You can boil 1L water within just 4 minutes.    With FlameCube mini / mini Pro, you can use twigs, pine cones, and other biomass found on the forest floor cooking an entire meal, you never need to buy fuel again.Due to its unique industrial design, the control module can be kept cool and avoid scalding no matter how long it is used.It is clean burning, high-efficiency, and fully sustainable without lugging fuel and the inherent risks of petrochemical use and minimizes your footprint.And most importantly, you won't get your hands dirty.  Each FlameCube mini/ mini Pro contains a touch control LED light,a charging cable, and a scouring pad.  Scouring pad: Use for cleaning and wrap the FlameCube mini/mini Pro in your backpack.  Touch control LED light:Measuring 17.7 in (45 CM) in length, touch control, three stage dimming. Charging cable: Blue custommade charging cable. Flat, noodles like structure can ensure that the unexpected pull will not easily break or damage cable, meanwhile it is not easy to tie knots.     Durable stainless steel construction, beautiful design, lightweight to carry and easy to use, we’ve made FlameCube mini / mini Pro a better choice for any outdoorfans to get rid of bulky stoves.  Unique air intake :Inspired by the work of legendary Genius Leonardo Da Vinci. Not only does the FlameCube mini & FlameCube mini Pro have a unique and beautiful appearance, and the amazing part is has a 21% increase in intake efficiency. Unique air outtake : Use the Simulate tools to analogy the airflow in the combustion chamber, to adjust the air passages to make this stove more efficiency and more powerful without smoke. With the special support design, no matter the twigs enters the combustion chamber at any angle and in any position, it can be supported by those triangular support points, leaving a gap for fresh air to pass through, which can significantly improve combustion efficiency and reduce smoke. And even if the twigs become charcoal, it can still maintain a higher heat output power.And what's more is FlameCube mini/ mini Pro would be better able to handle the moisture twigs too.  Side damping strip design: Increases friction and makes it easier to pull the control module out. Refuel Notch & Hinge structural design：We've designed wood refuel notches for the stove, so you don't have to pick up the pot every time you reload. Due to the Hinge structural design, can keep FlameCube mini & FlameCube mini Pro simple, strong and lightweight.   Protective circuit：A protective circuit in the stove control the jets to protect internal components automatically when the fire is on.The generator converts heat into electricity, store it into the battery built in. < Two years of work, hundreds of design proposals, dozens of prototypes, hundreds of times of testing, we've finally made a stove that we're proud to share with you all.                          With your support, we can bring FlameCube mini to the outdoors fans worldwide at a reasonable price and your support will help us achieve economies of scale and keep the product cost low.​       Hi there, my name is Yu Cui, I am the industrial designer of Aishu, the designer of FlameCube  .

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are two brothers born and raised in the beautiful state of Maine. We have always had a connection to the lush, mixed-growth forests that blanket Maine's landscapes, and since moving out of state a few years ago we have grown to appreciate the wildness that Maine has to offer even more as it's truly not something you can find anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>We have been studying environmental science and sustainability for most of our adult lives and we are ready to use our knowledge, experience, and passion to create a one-of-a-kind ""eco lodge"" for people eager to learn the secrets that only the Maine woods can teach. Forgotten Lore will be a place for visitors to connect with nature by living comfortably in off-grid yurts on nearly 20 acres of undeveloped forested land for the duration of their stay, while at the same time serving as a base-camp to explore some of the most popular tourist destinations in the country such as Acadia National Park and the amazing coast of Maine in general.</p>
<p>Although the Maine location will be a guaranteed success, Forgotten Lore will not end here. We will develop Forgotten Lore eco lodges in multiple regions, creating a cross-country network of comfortable off-grid sites for people looking to experience all different types of natural ecosystems: high mountain deserts of the southwest, the mountains and forests of southern Appalachia, the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest, and more.</p>
<p>By helping to fund the creation of Forgotten Lore, you will be helping to initiate an entirely new way of experiencing nature in different parts of the country. Forgotten Lore will be more than a brand...it will be a lifestyle.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630349539/kslwkykjlst6pyrekvh4.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Meet the Forgotten Lore team!</p>
<p><i>On the left: </i>Jason Duff</p>
<p>Jason has a Bachelor's of science in Environmental Science and a Master's degree in Biology. He currently works as a natural resource specialist in Colorodo focusing on water conservation, but is excited to start the Forgotten Lore Journey!</p>
<p><i>On the right:<i> </i></i>Matt Duff</p>
<p>Matt graduated from the University of Southern Maine in 2019 with a Bachelor's of Science in Environmental Science, and is currently completing his Master's degree in Earth Sciences from the University of Hawaii. He has always wanted to get back to his Maine roots and start a business aimed at preserving Maine's natural beauty and wildlife, and Forgotten Lore presents him with that opportunity.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising $25,000 to launch ""phase 1"" of Forgotten Lore Eco Lodge. We have purchased an approximately 20 acre plot of forested, undeveloped land located just up the coast from Acadia National Park, and during phase 1 of the project we will create everything that is necessary to host the first season of visitors and prove the concept before full expansion.</p>
<p>The money raised for this first phase will be used for the following four categories of expenses:</p>
<p>- Installing an access road and parking area</p>
<p>- Purchasing a large ""community area"" yurt and three smaller yurts to serve as the main            lodging</p>
<p>- Purchasing amenities to make the Forgotten Lore guests as comfortable and enjoyable as possible while remaining ""off grid"" (e.g. solar generators, composting toilets, canoe/kayaks, materials for trail building)</p>
<p>- Developing brand-specific merchandise to use for marketing purposes</p>
<p>The perks of investing in phase 1 of Forgotten Lore?:</p>
<p>- Discounted stays</p>
<p>- T-shirt with Forgotten Lore logo</p>
<p>What happens if we don't reach our entire goal? We will continue to self-fund, secure alternative investments, get loans, and/or whatever else it will take to make Forgotten Lore a reality!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Forgotten Lore will be the leader in a new branch of tourism which merges aspects of camping, sustainable living, environmental education, and health/wellness, among others. Everyone who stays there will benefit from the unique experience that we will provide, but the benefits go way beyond a few literal happy campers.</p>
<p>The local economies will benefit immensely because we will form partnerships with local businesses to help advertise their products and services to Forgotten Lore guests.</p>
<p>The environment will benefit because we will keep the land at every location as undeveloped as possible by minimizing clearing and utilizing primarily temporary structures; even the yurts will be able to be taken down seasonally and potentially even moved around to minimize impact to the land.</p>
<p>The world in general will benefit from the birth of this new concept within the giant sector of the economy that is tourism. We will even force eco-tourism to become more sustainable and more holistic in order to compete with Forgotten Lore. Travelling as we know it is in the past, Forgotten Lore and fully immersive off-grid living on majestic wild land is the way of the future.</p>
<p>The majority of our project experience is in designing and completing research projects spanning the fields of ecology, water quality management and control, conservation, and sustainability. We both have degrees in environmental science, one of us has a graduate degree in biology and the other will have a graduate degree in Earth Science/environmental science before the full launch of Forgotten Lore. We know how to stick to project timelines, manage budgets, and problem-solve/troubleshoot any obstacles that impede progress. We are ready to transform our thoughts of Forgotten Lore into their physical equivalent, and we welcome any contributions toward this extremely impactful goal.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Making Forgotten Lore a reality is not without risks/hurdles, but no business development ever is. We are firm believers in the idea that every problem has a solution and we welcome new challenges as evidence that we are making progress. Below are some examples of risks/hurdles that we have already acknowledged, and more importantly, our plan to overcome them:</p>
<p>Competition- We are not naïve and we fully acknowledge that vacation/tourism industry is well established and there could be some push back from larger organizations that don't want their customers to be drawn toward a different place to stay. However, we actually believe that we can turn this challenge into an advantage. Once Forgotten Lore becomes well-known, there will likely be a wait-list of guests trying to reserve spots for upcoming summer seasons. We will partner with other organizations so that we can recommend other places to stay before/after their stay at Forgotten Lore. Because our anticipated seasonal volume will be so much lower than competitors, there actually is very little (if any) direct competition.</p>
<p>Seasonality- The Gouldsboro location will be somewhat seasonal. The winters in Maine are harsh, and tourism all but dies in the winter months. Ultimately, this is one of the reasons for the plan to expand Forgotten Lore to other regions of the country so that there are locations in every climate for every part of the year. Also, even the Maine location and other locations with less than ideal non summer seasons will be able to cater toward certain sectors of the population, such as winter campers/hikers, snowshoers/cross country skiers, foragers, and schools seeking field trip locations, among others.</p>
<p>Pricing- Forgotten Lore is a novel concept and therefore we are setting the stage for what this type of experience is worth (monetarily). One of our goals is to keep prices reasonable so that people from all different socio-economic groups can reap the rewards that come with a stay at Forgotten Lore. Once we are established we would even like to create programs such as Forgotten Lore scholarship/grant competitions, reduced price/free stays for underprivileged  families, and more.</p>
<p>Changing the game- Again, we are not naïve. Creating a new way for people to experience nature and plan vacations to areas with incredible natural beauty will not be easy. It will require inexhaustible amounts of hard work, planning, and creative energy to educate the masses about what we are creating.</p>
<p>Forgotten Lore is not just a business...it's a way of life. If we don't do it then there's a chance no one will...and that is the biggest risk of them all.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>As we already mentioned, one of our challenges is educating the masses about Forgotten Lore. These are difficult times and of course not everyone can contribute financially to our project, but there are many other ways to help!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are two brothers born and raised in the beautiful state of Maine. We have always had a connection to the lush, mixed-growth forests that blanket Maine's landscapes, and since moving out of state a few years ago we have grown to appreciate the wildness that Maine has to offer even more as it's truly not something you can find anywhere else in the world.
We have been studying environmental science and sustainability for most of our adult lives and we are ready to use our knowledge, experience, and passion to create a one-of-a-kind ""eco lodge"" for people eager to learn the secrets that only the Maine woods can teach. Forgotten Lore will be a place for visitors to connect with nature by living comfortably in off-grid yurts on nearly 20 acres of undeveloped forested land for the duration of their stay, while at the same time serving as a base-camp to explore some of the most popular tourist destinations in the country such as Acadia National Park and the amazing coast of Maine in general.
Although the Maine location will be a guaranteed success, Forgotten Lore will not end here. We will develop Forgotten Lore eco lodges in multiple regions, creating a cross-country network of comfortable off-grid sites for people looking to experience all different types of natural ecosystems: high mountain deserts of the southwest, the mountains and forests of southern Appalachia, the temperate rainforests of the Pacific Northwest, and more.
By helping to fund the creation of Forgotten Lore, you will be helping to initiate an entirely new way of experiencing nature in different parts of the country. Forgotten Lore will be more than a brand...it will be a lifestyle.


Meet the Forgotten Lore team!
On the left: Jason Duff
Jason has a Bachelor's of science in Environmental Science and a Master's degree in Biology. He currently works as a natural resource specialist in Colorodo focusing on water conservation, but is excited to start the Forgotten Lore Journey!
On the right: Matt Duff
Matt graduated from the University of Southern Maine in 2019 with a Bachelor's of Science in Environmental Science, and is currently completing his Master's degree in Earth Sciences from the University of Hawaii. He has always wanted to get back to his Maine roots and start a business aimed at preserving Maine's natural beauty and wildlife, and Forgotten Lore presents him with that opportunity.
What We Need & What You Get
We are raising $25,000 to launch ""phase 1"" of Forgotten Lore Eco Lodge. We have purchased an approximately 20 acre plot of forested, undeveloped land located just up the coast from Acadia National Park, and during phase 1 of the project we will create everything that is necessary to host the first season of visitors and prove the concept before full expansion.
The money raised for this first phase will be used for the following four categories of expenses:
- Installing an access road and parking area
- Purchasing a large ""community area"" yurt and three smaller yurts to serve as the main            lodging
- Purchasing amenities to make the Forgotten Lore guests as comfortable and enjoyable as possible while remaining ""off grid"" (e.g. solar generators, composting toilets, canoe/kayaks, materials for trail building)
- Developing brand-specific merchandise to use for marketing purposes
The perks of investing in phase 1 of Forgotten Lore?:
- Discounted stays
- T-shirt with Forgotten Lore logo
What happens if we don't reach our entire goal? We will continue to self-fund, secure alternative investments, get loans, and/or whatever else it will take to make Forgotten Lore a reality!
 

The Impact
Forgotten Lore will be the leader in a new branch of tourism which merges aspects of camping, sustainable living, environmental education, and health/wellness, among others. Everyone who stays there will benefit from the unique experience that we will provide, but the benefits go way beyond a few literal happy campers.
The local economies will benefit immensely because we will form partnerships with local businesses to help advertise their products and services to Forgotten Lore guests.
The environment will benefit because we will keep the land at every location as undeveloped as possible by minimizing clearing and utilizing primarily temporary structures; even the yurts will be able to be taken down seasonally and potentially even moved around to minimize impact to the land.
The world in general will benefit from the birth of this new concept within the giant sector of the economy that is tourism. We will even force eco-tourism to become more sustainable and more holistic in order to compete with Forgotten Lore. Travelling as we know it is in the past, Forgotten Lore and fully immersive off-grid living on majestic wild land is the way of the future.
The majority of our project experience is in designing and completing research projects spanning the fields of ecology, water quality management and control, conservation, and sustainability. We both have degrees in environmental science, one of us has a graduate degree in biology and the other will have a graduate degree in Earth Science/environmental science before the full launch of Forgotten Lore. We know how to stick to project timelines, manage budgets, and problem-solve/troubleshoot any obstacles that impede progress. We are ready to transform our thoughts of Forgotten Lore into their physical equivalent, and we welcome any contributions toward this extremely impactful goal.
 

Risks & Challenges
Making Forgotten Lore a reality is not without risks/hurdles, but no business development ever is. We are firm believers in the idea that every problem has a solution and we welcome new challenges as evidence that we are making progress. Below are some examples of risks/hurdles that we have already acknowledged, and more importantly, our plan to overcome them:
Competition- We are not naïve and we fully acknowledge that vacation/tourism industry is well established and there could be some push back from larger organizations that don't want their customers to be drawn toward a different place to stay. However, we actually believe that we can turn this challenge into an advantage. Once Forgotten Lore becomes well-known, there will likely be a wait-list of guests trying to reserve spots for upcoming summer seasons. We will partner with other organizations so that we can recommend other places to stay before/after their stay at Forgotten Lore. Because our anticipated seasonal volume will be so much lower than competitors, there actually is very little (if any) direct competition.
Seasonality- The Gouldsboro location will be somewhat seasonal. The winters in Maine are harsh, and tourism all but dies in the winter months. Ultimately, this is one of the reasons for the plan to expand Forgotten Lore to other regions of the country so that there are locations in every climate for every part of the year. Also, even the Maine location and other locations with less than ideal non summer seasons will be able to cater toward certain sectors of the population, such as winter campers/hikers, snowshoers/cross country skiers, foragers, and schools seeking field trip locations, among others.
Pricing- Forgotten Lore is a novel concept and therefore we are setting the stage for what this type of experience is worth (monetarily). One of our goals is to keep prices reasonable so that people from all different socio-economic groups can reap the rewards that come with a stay at Forgotten Lore. Once we are established we would even like to create programs such as Forgotten Lore scholarship/grant competitions, reduced price/free stays for underprivileged  families, and more.
Changing the game- Again, we are not naïve. Creating a new way for people to experience nature and plan vacations to areas with incredible natural beauty will not be easy. It will require inexhaustible amounts of hard work, planning, and creative energy to educate the masses about what we are creating.
Forgotten Lore is not just a business...it's a way of life. If we don't do it then there's a chance no one will...and that is the biggest risk of them all.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
As we already mentioned, one of our challenges is educating the masses about Forgotten Lore. These are difficult times and of course not everyone can contribute financially to our project, but there are many other ways to help!

The Power Version has a built-in battery just like the Battery Version but produces much high pressure than the other 2 versions. REWARDSWe partnered up with Kickbooster to set up this Referral Program, after joining which you'll be able to earn 10% commission for every pledge you help us raise. Don't miss out. CHARGING & POWERINGNorshire Mini can be powered and recharged, in the case of the battery version, via a cigarette lighter that comes with or a 5V/2A DC adapter like those we use to charge our cellphones. Of course 5V is not enough to power our device, but we'll include a special charging cable, as shown below, that boasts the voltage to 12V. Please note that the package doesn't include a 5V/2A DC adapter as we figured everybody has already got one, even more than one. This is to save our environment, and some cost too. We thank you for your understanding.Producing & Final TestingAs you can see, 90% of our products are made of metal, which is very heavy in our hands and feels very good. Of course, this is mainly to reduce the vibration, in addition to better heat dissipation. The lower left corner of the OLED display shows the temperature of the equipment. You can also use it as a precision thermometer. In another display interface, its accuracy can reach 0.01.We hope to show you the best inflatable pumps in the world.RISKS & CHALLENGES It is a fairly simple product and it's is already in pilot production. We are confident that with a few minor tweaks and a couple of weeks of bringing up the manufacturing will run smoothly.",22.0,1,"3 Campaigns

She spent the next four months in a coma. While she has since recovered and graduated from college, Dave and Co-founder Jordan Klein quickly learned that Dave's sister was one of 85,000 Americans to suffer a traumatic brain injury from cycling-related accidents that year.So David and Jordan asked: ""How can we make cycling safer?"". After three years of development, the new Park & Diamond helmet will answer this question!   The Park & Diamond helmet will pass all U.S. and E.U regulations to make sure you get the protection you need while riding a bicycle or kick scooter. Adult sizes will be available first.   When a traditional bike helmet bounces, the EPS foam protective material releases the energy back to the users head during impact increasing the total momentum change the wearer experiences. With this greater momentum change, there is a greater likelihood of a head injury.The Park & Diamond Bike Helmet’s patented protective material absorbs and dissipates three times more elastic energy than a traditional bike helmet, which means significantly less energy is being transferred to the head, and making the Park & Diamond Helmet a better bike helmet. CBS Innovation Nation May 2019     Click on the image to earn cash rewards for pledges from your own referral link!  Our helmet is light and easy to carry. You can roll it up in its custom carry case and store in your backpack, messenger bag or handbag.     Make a personal statement with our customizable helmet skins.  Choose your limited edition color and pattern.   The Park & Diamond helmet is breathable and washable, especially important during warm biking months. Want to change your look? The outside skin is easily replaceable.              Select color and size on the Backerkit survey we send to you 10-14 days after your order date    Additional helmet skins available exclusively on Backerkit, when you fill out your order survey. Colors currently available:  Black, Navy, Gray, Tan, Pink & Maroon only.  The Park & Diamond helmet was designed using patented and proprietary protection materials that are significantly more efficient at absorbing and dissipating energy than traditional bike helmets, It folds/rolls-up into a unique cylindrical case, and has washable and interchangeable skins.* The Park & Diamond™  Helmet is designed and engineered to comply with  U.S, Australia/New  Zealand, and European Union cycling safety standards.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In July of 2019 Jason Perez and Wesley Long merged their two existing brands to create what is now Instinct Ready Inc. Jason and Wesley are active Emergency Medical Technicians and industry educators, and for over 6 years have been teaching emergency preparedness as well as CPR and First Aid in our local community. Their combined knowledge and experience in emergency response, as well as our robust two hour emergency preparedness curriculum based on FEMA and NOAA guidelines, creates the foundation for the U-PAK Pro.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605041744/sr1uyxjvj9qmxvwuyyyd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>We have already been incorporated, in business, and delivering products for over a year and a half. We are raising $15,000 to cover product acquisition costs for increased purchasing power to provide higher quality products and services for our customers and community. As COVID19 continues to affect us, the cost of emergency preparedness equipment and supplies steadily increases. As a result, we must increase the price of our entire product line to start 2021.</p>
<h3>What You Are Getting</h3>
<p>The U-PAK Pro is a fresh new take on survival kits. It is the survival system meant to be used, not just stored in your closet. Use it to get acquainted with the great outdoors by taking it camping or backpacking. With regular use, you will become familiar with the contents and tools so when a disaster strikes you will be ready!</p>

<p>The U-PAK Pro is stocked with over 200 survival and comfort items to sustain you. In fact we have built it to match the essential categories we teach in our Fundamentals of Disaster Preparedness class.</p>

<h3>The Value</h3>
<p>The U-PAK Pro 2021 MSRP will be $449, which is already a big value considering what’s inside. To get all this stuff yourself will cost you nearly $625, even on Amazon. Trust us we've done the math. However, during this launch campaign we are giving you access to incredible discounts that will probably never be repeated. This campaign is the time to buy! </p>
<p>Instinct Ready’s UPAK Pro Survival System was designed to save your life in a disaster, but it's durability and versatility beg for it to be used often throughout the year.</p>
<p>The U-PAK Pro is Survival Built | Adventure Ready but we need your help to equip and keep safe as many lives as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As 2020 has shown us, we all need to be prepared and preparedness starts at home because prepared families create prepared communities. Join our backer community to help us keep families and communities safe and prepared through our products and services.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have been working for months to minimize your risks. We have already completed design, prototype QA (the bag in our video and pictures), and we have taken delivery of our first 200 bags.  We are now ready to scale on demand based on campaign success with an estimated 45 day turn around from quantity order to delivery from our factory team. So when this campaign closes the last ordered bag should be delivered within a maximum of 60 days.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Hopefully you don't need a survival system because you and your family are fully prepared already.  If so you can still help by sending this link to your friends and family that aren't prepared. Follow Instinct Ready on our socials and maybe even sign up for a zoom class for you and your loved ones on our website <a href=""http://www.instinctready.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.instinctready.com</a>.</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
In July of 2019 Jason Perez and Wesley Long merged their two existing brands to create what is now Instinct Ready Inc. Jason and Wesley are active Emergency Medical Technicians and industry educators, and for over 6 years have been teaching emergency preparedness as well as CPR and First Aid in our local community. Their combined knowledge and experience in emergency response, as well as our robust two hour emergency preparedness curriculum based on FEMA and NOAA guidelines, creates the foundation for the U-PAK Pro.


Goals
We have already been incorporated, in business, and delivering products for over a year and a half. We are raising $15,000 to cover product acquisition costs for increased purchasing power to provide higher quality products and services for our customers and community. As COVID19 continues to affect us, the cost of emergency preparedness equipment and supplies steadily increases. As a result, we must increase the price of our entire product line to start 2021.
What You Are Getting
The U-PAK Pro is a fresh new take on survival kits. It is the survival system meant to be used, not just stored in your closet. Use it to get acquainted with the great outdoors by taking it camping or backpacking. With regular use, you will become familiar with the contents and tools so when a disaster strikes you will be ready!

The U-PAK Pro is stocked with over 200 survival and comfort items to sustain you. In fact we have built it to match the essential categories we teach in our Fundamentals of Disaster Preparedness class.

Water
Food
Clothing
Shelter
Communication & Navigation
Health & Hygiene
Tools & Sustainability

We have organized all the gear and supplies into a convenient and easy to use storage system to keep everything accessible and ready to go. 

The Highlights

Most survival kits give you a piece of tin foil to keep you warm. The U-PAK Pro features the most advanced shelter and warmth solution in any survival system with an actual tent, compact sleeping bag, and sleeping pad. 

If you’re in a pinch the nut free and non-GMO food rations will keep you energized, and if your feeling a little culinary creative, the light weight cooking kit has got you covered. Stay hydrated with emergency water, water filters, and an in-line hydration bladder.

No survival system, including ours, can provide your own clothing, but we can give you a dedicated spot for it. So we did. The included storage cube even provides clothing recommendations.

<p>The number of people who die in a <strong>bicycle accident</strong> every year is about <strong>500,000</strong>. 60% of bicycle accidents are in <strong>rear-side accidents</strong>. This is why bike riders need a rear-view mirror. However,</p>
<p>Many riders do not mount rear-view mirrors because of the cumbersome design of conventional rear-view mirrors designed to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3><strong>We have designed the safest and minimalist rear-view mirror in the world to solve these problems.</strong></h3>

! SAFETY FIRST !
The number of people who die in a bicycle accident every year is about 500,000. 60% of bicycle accidents are in rear-side accidents. This is why bike riders need a rear-view mirror. However,
Many riders do not mount rear-view mirrors because of the cumbersome design of conventional rear-view mirrors designed to prevent accidents.
We have designed the safest and minimalist rear-view mirror in the world to solve these problems.

<p>A hypalon pouch keeps the utensil safely stowed away. The carabiner allows it to be attached almost anywhere for safe keeping. The pouch stores a ferrocerium fire starting flint that can be used in conjunction with the angled edge of the can opener to create a spark to get your fire going wherever in the wilderness you might be.</p>

<p>In the middle of the utensil you will find a bottle opener which also functions as a handy potato peeler. Next to this is a can opener and chord cutter. The end of the utensil can be used in a variety of ways, be it a flat head screw driver, ply-bar for opening lids or even a box cutter for opening food packaging.</p>

<p>We are all set up with our manufacturing partner in Hong Kong that we have worked closely with for the last 5 years. They are experts in original equipment manufacturing, specialising in metal engineering. The Muncher will be stamped from 1.5mm sheet titanium and then CNC'd. It will be finished by polishing and sandblasting, giving it its unique high quality finish.</p>
<p>The pouch is made from a durable laser engraved hypalon material double stitched along either side with a riveted hole for the carabiner to attach.</p>
<p>The money raised from kickstarter will allow us to make the tooling and place an order for the initial production run.</p>

<p>With the ""Kiwi No.8 wire mentality"" (basically you can fix anything with a piece of fencing wire) Mark (Full Windsor founder) looked into how he could reduce the amount of gear you need when heading out into the whop-whops / outdoors / wilderness / whatever you wanna call it. He decided the spork was a great jumping off point, but surely more could be done!

</div></div>","Reviewed by Globo Surf - https://www.globosurfer.com/muncher-titanium-mu...The Muncher packs a punch with 10 functionalities. Made from AEROSPACE GRADE TITANIUM, it is amazingly strong and light-weight at just 0.7oz / 20grams. The ideal companion on any trip where weight and space are a consideration. The Muncher's versatility makes it an everyday carry for any adventurer or traveller, be it camping in your back yard to backpacking around the world.  A Gift Certificate is available for download here to print at home, so you can give The Muncher as a gift.   Both spork and serrated knife are highly polished for an easy to clean finish. Because it is made of titanium you will experience no metallic smell or taste. Also, it does not rust like other metals.

A hypalon pouch keeps the utensil safely stowed away. The carabiner allows it to be attached almost anywhere for safe keeping. The pouch stores a ferrocerium fire starting flint that can be used in conjunction with the angled edge of the can opener to create a spark to get your fire going wherever in the wilderness you might be.

 

In the middle of the utensil you will find a bottle opener which also functions as a handy potato peeler. Next to this is a can opener and chord cutter. The end of the utensil can be used in a variety of ways, be it a flat head screw driver, ply-bar for opening lids or even a box cutter for opening food packaging.

 

We are all set up with our manufacturing partner in Hong Kong that we have worked closely with for the last 5 years. They are experts in original equipment manufacturing, specialising in metal engineering. The Muncher will be stamped from 1.5mm sheet titanium and then CNC'd. It will be finished by polishing and sandblasting, giving it its unique high quality finish.
The pouch is made from a durable laser engraved hypalon material double stitched along either side with a riveted hole for the carabiner to attach.
The money raised from kickstarter will allow us to make the tooling and place an order for the initial production run.

With the ""Kiwi No.8 wire mentality"" (basically you can fix anything with a piece of fencing wire) Mark (Full Windsor founder) looked into how he could reduce the amount of gear you need when heading out into the whop-whops / outdoors / wilderness / whatever you wanna call it. He decided the spork was a great jumping off point, but surely more could be done! Listing the most commonly used tools involved around food and its preparation whilst in the middle of nowhere, he began the design process. 
With functionality at the top of the checklist, every function of the multi utensil had to work great in its own right. With weight also being a major consideration, titanium was an obvious choice of material. After a year and a half of design and hundreds of tweaks later The Muncher (or the ""Kiwi Army Spork"" as we like to call it) was born.

<p>The networks in many countries are not interconnected, or the tariffs of networks in different regions are high and inconsistent. As a result, we often go to a country to prepare in advance to purchase local SIM cards and roaming data. So we developed WICOMM, a product that helps you overcome international network barriers, and at the same time, allows you to enjoy the world's most affordable international roaming traffic, so that you can surf the Internet, work, and entertain anytime, anywhere, no matter where you go.</p>

<p>The best and most reliable method that we know of is the measure either foot yourself and check the size chart we have published on our campaign page by checking the CM length. To do this simply:</p>
<p>1. Place a sheet of A4 paper on the ground facing away from you with your back up against a wall or a door to hold yourself steady.</p>
<p>2. As carefully as possible, draw around your foot with a pen or a pencil - paying attention to the edge of your heel and the tip of your largest toe.</p>
<p>3. Once drawn around, lay a rule from the furthest part of the heel to the edge of your big toe and measure in CM how large your foot is.</p>
<p>4. Cross-reference this with the sizing guide below and use the CM length to establish your perfect size for Freestate. </p>
<p>If you notice that your measurement sits between two sizes, then please use the larger size to establish the size you should be looking to request. </p></figure></div><div data-id=""22578583""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div><div data-id=""22578601""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1539805383/t8qzvfrnva9u8uvguxbm.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p style=""text-align: center;"">Freestate Is the very first shoe from the Manchester UK footwear team called Ten Thousand Islands.

In a nutshell our simple idea was to create the 'go-to' summer companion….not so simple after all.  Sole blue prints, pattern trials and prototypes have been our reality for the past 18 months. We have taken our trials around the world for over 12 months now, putting them through all kinds of extreme wear tests in some of the Worlds toughest infinity pools and some of Europe’s most stunning deserted beaches all in the name of extreme product testing, and when these trials have been completed we have returned back home to put our well-travelled trials through one last test ….a 30 degree machine wash.  Please see the options below.  Please see the sizing guide below to know what sizes we will be supporting. Once we start shipping we will make sure to remind you to amend your selection to make sure it is correct. 

The best and most reliable method that we know of is the measure either foot yourself and check the size chart we have published on our campaign page by checking the CM length. To do this simply:
1. Place a sheet of A4 paper on the ground facing away from you with your back up against a wall or a door to hold yourself steady.
2. As carefully as possible, draw around your foot with a pen or a pencil - paying attention to the edge of your heel and the tip of your largest toe.
3. Once drawn around, lay a rule from the furthest part of the heel to the edge of your big toe and measure in CM how large your foot is.
4. Cross-reference this with the sizing guide below and use the CM length to establish your perfect size for Freestate. 
If you notice that your measurement sits between two sizes, then please use the larger size to establish the size you should be looking to request.  Freestate Is the very first shoe from the Manchester UK footwear team called Ten Thousand Islands. In a town known more for rain than sun we wanted to put our combined expertise (and love of sunshine) to use in creating a footwear brand aimed at all things travel. We have designed and developed shoes for many other brands for over 20 years, but this time we wanted to create our very own brand that would enable us to make footwear we felt we would all wear when we get away to sunnier places. Freestate is a shoe we have all had the chance to wear test over the last 12 months in all kinds of climates and conditions and it’s a shoe we have all come to love. Our brief was to create the perfect multipurpose shoe that looked as good as it performs...we think we succeeded. Partners",45.0,1,"1 Campaign

<br/><p>While delivering life-saving medicines to remote communities around 
the world, Kapil Dev Singh realized that his ""high-end"", waterproof gear
 was making him sweaty &amp; uncomfortable  in the hot &amp; humid 
conditions. Challenged by the discomfort, and inspired by the zest for 
life he saw in these communities, Kapil started Mishmi Takin to make 
gear so breathable that it could work even in high humidity 
conditions. Since our products <b>BREATHE </b>better even in 
challenging, rainy and humid environments (like Seattle, London and 
Tampa), they OUT-PERFORM in other more colder or drier environments also
 - like in New Hampshire, Utah or Southern California!</p>
<p>Mishmi 
Takin boots and jackets focus on enhanced user comfort by maximizing air
 exchange between the inside of the gear and the outside. 
Ventilation-focused product design, highly breathable, air permeable 
eVent fabrics, and Vibram Megagrip rubber, give our Footwear and Jackets
 the power to keep you comfortable in hot, cold, humid, soggy, or any 
WET conditions … yes, even SWEATY conditions.  </p>

<p>Almost all hiking boots (and most shells) on the market today feature
 a 'Wet System’ solid Polyurethane (PU) membrane. For a 'Wet System’ 
membrane to start working, the temperature and humidity inside the gear 
must increase first. The increased humidity inside triggers condensation
 on PU membrane, which is followed by a 3-step process of absorption, 
diffusion, and then evaporation to pass through the membrane.  </p>
<p>This
 process is painfully SLOW and makes you feel sweaty before beginning to
 work. So, even in colder and drier climates there is a period of 
discomfort before the gear starts to breathe. In rain or high humidity, 
this process shuts down completely because the humidity inside and 
outside is the same. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461863742/headline_different_zfmgqb.png"" data-vivaldi-spatnav-clickable=""1"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Mishmi Takin uses DRY-SYSTEM membranes and fabrics that are 
micro-porous and air permeable, resulting in expulsion of water vapor in
 a single-step. This is supplemented by use of multiple, additional 
physical ventilation features that enhance air exchange and keep you 
comfortable. No other hiking footwear or jacket offers this level of 
breath-ability.</p>
<p>In other words: <b>We breathe even in conditions where others don't!</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>

<div>
<p>The critical difference between our technology and traditional 
waterproof and/or breathable fabrics lies in the millions of microscopic
 pores built into the eVent proprietary membrane that works instantly to
 vent water vapor that builds up inside your gear. Because of this 
Direct Venting™ Technology, and unlike others, you don't need to get 
sweaty for it to start to work. It’s a 'Dry System' that allows eVent 
fabrics to be fully waterproof and fully breathable – keeping you dry 
and comfortable in the widest range of temperatures and conditions. </p>

<br/><p>Our idea for an outdoor brand grew from our Founder Kapil Dev Singh’s
 experiences delivering medicines and hiking in his native India as well
 as Liberia, West Africa. 
While in the tropical forests of Eastern Himalayas and West Africa, he 
realized that he couldn’t find boots or outerwear that worked properly 
in high humidity conditions. After multiple soggy and slippery 
experiences, he saw an opportunity to create ultra-breathable 
performance hiking boots designed to perform in tropical conditions. It 
helps that he’s also an MIT grad. </p>
<p>Kapil was also motivated by a 
desire to highlight the passion for life and resilience that is often 
found amidst adversity in the poor parts of the world by promoting 
health and wellbeing in regions that are not always comfortable and hard
 to enjoy. </p>
<p>Kapil searched the globe for the best designers and 
factories, then engineered a product to perform equally well across all 
wet climates. He knew that no corner could be cut, and every detail had 
to be perfect. The result is a footwear line Made in Europe from best 
materials designed to solve the simple problem of staying comfortable 
when the conditions are at their worst.

the world, Kapil Dev Singh realized that his ""high-end"", waterproof gear
 was making him sweaty & uncomfortable  in the hot & humid 
conditions. Challenged by the discomfort, and inspired by the zest for 
life he saw in these communities, Kapil started Mishmi Takin to make 
gear so breathable that it could work even in high humidity 
conditions. Since our products BREATHE better even in 
challenging, rainy and humid environments (like Seattle, London and 
Tampa), they OUT-PERFORM in other more colder or drier environments also
 - like in New Hampshire, Utah or Southern California!
Mishmi 
Takin boots and jackets focus on enhanced user comfort by maximizing air
 exchange between the inside of the gear and the outside. 
Ventilation-focused product design, highly breathable, air permeable 
eVent fabrics, and Vibram Megagrip rubber, give our Footwear and Jackets
 the power to keep you comfortable in hot, cold, humid, soggy, or any 
WET conditions … yes, even SWEATY conditions.  
Our products are ideal for:

Almost all hiking boots (and most shells) on the market today feature
 a 'Wet System’ solid Polyurethane (PU) membrane. For a 'Wet System’ 
membrane to start working, the temperature and humidity inside the gear 
must increase first. The increased humidity inside triggers condensation
 on PU membrane, which is followed by a 3-step process of absorption, 
diffusion, and then evaporation to pass through the membrane.  
This
 process is painfully SLOW and makes you feel sweaty before beginning to
 work. So, even in colder and drier climates there is a period of 
discomfort before the gear starts to breathe. In rain or high humidity, 
this process shuts down completely because the humidity inside and 
outside is the same. 




Mishmi Takin uses DRY-SYSTEM membranes and fabrics that are 
micro-porous and air permeable, resulting in expulsion of water vapor in
 a single-step. This is supplemented by use of multiple, additional 
physical ventilation features that enhance air exchange and keep you 
comfortable. No other hiking footwear or jacket offers this level of 
breath-ability.
In other words: We breathe even in conditions where others don't!






The critical difference between our technology and traditional 
waterproof and/or breathable fabrics lies in the millions of microscopic
 pores built into the eVent proprietary membrane that works instantly to
 vent water vapor that builds up inside your gear. Because of this 
Direct Venting™ Technology, and unlike others, you don't need to get 
sweaty for it to start to work. It’s a 'Dry System' that allows eVent 
fabrics to be fully waterproof and fully breathable – keeping you dry 
and comfortable in the widest range of temperatures and conditions.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Utah is a preeminent venue for outdoor, adventurous athletic events.</strong></p>
<p>Is it ""outlandish"" to connect <a href=""http://www.valkyrierelay.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Valkyrie's</a> seven sports to a 100-mi racecourse in Utah’s beloved Wasatch Mountains? No similar race is happening in the West right now, and yet this inaugural annual event is drawing athletes from all over the United States.</p>
<p><strong>Communities who aspire to great things, deserve nice things.</strong></p>
<p>Having competed in a similar event in the northwest, we think other active communities deserve nice things, too. It’s exceptionally hard to launch a new, co-present, grand event - even without a pandemic – It’s felt at times, insurmountable. But nothing truly worthwhile is ever easy. The Valkyrie aspires to be a community rally-point and destination annual event. Having partnered with the <a href=""https://ourwcf.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wasatch Community Foundation</a> and their mission, the Valkyrie can be a great vehicle for their causes.</p>
<p><strong>This relay race has a place – at home. </strong>                                                                                     </p>
<p>Co-Founder, Dan Merkley has clocked a 25-year career, mostly abroad, planning and operating unique accommodation services for major international sporting events - notably Winter &amp; Summer Olympic and Paralympic Athlete Villages. While the Pandemic has crushed those prospects, the planning and operating of sporting spectacles still draw him as a moth to flame - and for a chance to devote everything to a project of his and Co-Founder, Shawn Snow’s own making. Shawn has been active in the endurance sports community as an event promoter. He was a founding member of the Endurance Sports Show, an endurance sports-focused expo in Salt Lake Valley. The show brought together manufacturers, retailers, coaches, educators, and event companies, in an expo-style setting. Shawn was also the event director of the Mt. Nebo Challenge, a road bike 100-miler that crossed over Mt. Nebo, the southernmost and highest mountain in the Wasatch Range of Utah. It is their mission the Valkyrie belong to the Wasatch community of Utah for its love of outdoor recreation, and its <a href=""https://www.comevolunteer.com/events/13570-valkyrie-relay/volunteer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">generous volunteer spirit</a>.</p>
<p><strong>If there were ever a non-sport metaphor for endurance sport, planning the Valkyrie is it. </strong></p>
<p>We have been promoting and shaping the Valkyrie Relay for three years. Permitting, pandemic, and surprise road-work obstructions have smacked us down twice already without a chance at something to show for this great relay race - until now. But we and the Valkyrie are better for it. We are COMMITTED to proving the concept of this race in Utah, THIS YEAR. A self-financed endeavor, we have pivoted and responded boldly to every obstruction.</p>
<p><strong>Responsible. Resourceful. Right-sized.</strong></p>
<p>We have been realistic and responsible stewards. While launching this new event concept, we have kept our goal modest: DO THE RACE. PROVE THE CONCEPT. HAVE SOMETHING TO SHOW NEW PARTNERS. We ask the Indiegogo community to help fund our assurance of a safe race, and one that shows respect for competitor and volunteer welfare. Won't you help us get it over the finish line? </p>

<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p><strong>""The first one through the wall is always bloodiest.""</strong></p>
<p>SUCCESS: event permitting in the uncertainty of a pandemic, with the ""moving target"" of public health policy</p>
<p>OVERCAME: recent, sudden road closures and historical drought conditions, creating the need to reroute and reconfigure nearly the entire racecourse, its operations, permits, service contracts, and staffing.</p>
<p>THE RAZOR'S EDGE: Recruiting enough volunteers to staff a 100-mile course, including donated time from specialized skill and knowledge to manage sport-specific courses and operations. </p>
<p>THE BRINK: Cash flow to execute the version of this race event that early-adopting participants deserve, and is equal to our tenacity and belief in it.</p>
<p>PREVAILING ANYWAY: Two dads with ""day jobs(?),"" boot-strapping the launch of a new brand and a new race concept that is largely unfamiliar to, and demanding of its participants, venue owners, and public agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>

""The first one through the wall is always bloodiest.""
SUCCESS: event permitting in the uncertainty of a pandemic, with the ""moving target"" of public health policy
OVERCAME: recent, sudden road closures and historical drought conditions, creating the need to reroute and reconfigure nearly the entire racecourse, its operations, permits, service contracts, and staffing.
THE RAZOR'S EDGE: Recruiting enough volunteers to staff a 100-mile course, including donated time from specialized skill and knowledge to manage sport-specific courses and operations. 
THE BRINK: Cash flow to execute the version of this race event that early-adopting participants deserve, and is equal to our tenacity and belief in it.
PREVAILING ANYWAY: Two dads with ""day jobs(?),"" boot-strapping the launch of a new brand and a new race concept that is largely unfamiliar to, and demanding of its participants, venue owners, and public agencies.

<p> </p></figure></div></div>","Today, more and more cyclists have stopped using traditional bike locks. They are cumbersome, hard to use, expensive, and just not that secure. Not to mention the fact that they often leave you locked out if you forget your keys, lose the combination or fail to keep the lock charged. 
   A bicycle lock is supposed to make your life easier, not harder. That’s why we invented Weeylock, a smart, secure, and solar-powered bike lock that offers active protection with an always-on theft alert, reliable smart features, and a tamper-proof case.  Leave your bike to Weeylock and enjoy a carefree riding experience.    
  Say goodbye to losing keys, forgetting lock combinations, or facing a dead battery. Weeylock supports both smartphone keyless entry and key fob unlocking.  Unlock Weeylock with one simple tap using the smartphone app in seconds. Get going before everyone else. 
 Weeylock maximizes keyless convenience for you. Each lock also comes with a key fob that offers automatic unlocking.  
  
 Meet the lock that never runs out of battery. Weeylock is solar-powered. The built-in solar panel automatically recharges its battery in both outdoor and indoor light, so you can recharge your bike lock on the go.  
 Designed with a built-in lithium battery, Weeylock lasts for up to 3 months on one full charge. 
 
 Having your precious bicycle stolen is a heartbreaking experience. Weeylock has an always-on theft alert that prevents it from happening.  
 Equipped with a sensitive motion sensor, Weeylock detects any unauthorized movement instantly. When someone tries to tamper with your bike, Weeylock initiates a shrieking 110 dB alarm. 
 Weeylock resists attacks of all kinds. Built with reinforced glass fiber and aluminum alloy, the case is rugged, shockproof, and tamper-proof.  Its Bluetooth connection is equipped with AES 128 encryption that effectively prevents any virtual attack.  
 When pairing Weeylock with the phone Bluetooth, a 4-digit passcode is required. Adding an extra layer of security for your bicycle.  
 Weeylock is more than a bicycle lock, it is your personal cycling assistant. It keeps track of your real-time cycling data such as current speed, maximum speed and cycling routes. 
 Want to share your bike with friends and family, but you are not around to give them the key?  Simply use the app to grant access remotely without the need for passcodes.    
 When the battery life is low, you will receive a low battery reminder through the app. Forget the dread of returning to a deadlock situation and streamline your daily activities.   
 Unlock endless possibilities with Weeylock. You can use it on motorcycles, RVs, scooters, canoes, front doors, garage gates, and any situation that requires convenient reliable security.    
 
 Weeylock is waterproof and weatherproof, so you can use it even in extreme weather. What's even better? Weeylock is much lighter than most other smart bicycle locks while remaining secure and durable. So you can forget about security and enjoy the simple joy of riding.",33.0,6,"1 Campaign

<h3>Challenges I faced as an Inventor</h3>
<p>We're a small team (South Korean) of dedicated individuals who've been on a rollercoaster. </p>
<p>We researched, developed, and applied a technology that minimizes loss of airflow to the back of the <strong>neck based on the Coandă effect.</strong> The Coandă effect is the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to a convex surface.</p>
<p>We researched, developed, and applied technology that can minimize the loss of airflow towards the back of the neck. This loss of airflow is caused by the <strong>Coanda effect</strong>, which is when a jet flow attaches itself to a surface and remains attached even when the surface curves away towards another direction.</p>
<p>It needs to be wearable, so the <strong>design was VERY important.</strong> </p>
<p>Making a small and beautiful product that fully contains a fan's function was a lot more complex than I thought.</p>
<p>If I made it bigger and <strong>not worry about the design</strong>, I could have made it without any trouble. But <strong>would I be proud</strong> of my product? <strong>The answer would be NO.</strong></p>
<p>So I had to dig deep. </p>
<p>The big reason why companies have not been able to successfully make small-sized wearable fans is most likely because of the noise. The noise generated can be loud and unpleasant because the fan needs to rotate at a high speed in order to create airflow within a small area.</p>
<p>We tried various methods such as applying a vibration pad to the mount that holds the motor, changing the mount's material to hard and soft, and creating a vibration dispersion shape.</p>
<p>Just as a small car engine has less power than the engine of a tank, <strong>it is difficult to make a strong airflow if the propeller is small.</strong></p>
<p>In order to create a design that is both small and efficient, we have tested a wide variety of fans and propellers such as a wingless method, a blower fan, an axial fan, and a reverse dual fan. <strong>Airable's propeller is about 1/10th the size of our competitor's propeller. </strong></p>
<p>Rather than just changing the angle, we designed it by changing variables such as Camber, Skew, Chord, Lake, Pitch, and NACA airfoil, which are complex variables of the propeller. We developed it by conducting CFD and wind tunnel experiments. </p>
<p>In addition, the battery's compatibility (voltage, electric power), the motor, and the wind intake are all more important than the propeller alone. We tailored the exclusive motor and the whole battery to balance the product, and tested it after making numerous changes to the mechanical parts.</p>

</div></div>","Love the outdoors but don’t like the heat? We have a solution for you. Airable provides a refreshing breeze at the touch of a button.Airable is lightweight and portable. You can enjoy a cool breeze wherever you are. Whether it’s for work, sports or leisure, you’ll feel cooler with Airable. Giving you an advantage in hot situations.  We have tested Airable with the public and received a fantastic response. It has been praised for its great design, cool airflow, and stable fit. With Airable, this summer will no longer be a problem. 
     GolfCamping, BBQTennisCyclingChilling at home, OfficeWith Airable, you can go on a run, hike, be at the beach, play sports, travel, and more. The possibilities are endless!Don’t let the heat stop you from doing something you love.We want you to accomplish more with Airable. Be adventurous and let Airable work its magic.  If you’re the kind of person who likes to stay cool both literally and figuratively, then you are going to love Airable. (Airable's design is patented and has received an award for its design.) Airable is the only wearable fan in the world that has a magnetic fastener for your clothes. This allows Airable to remain securely attached even with rough movements. (E.g.: Running, boxing, doing front/backflips, and more)Airable was designed ergonomically so it rests comfortably around your neck and shoulder.  It was also designed and tested to be aerodynamically effective. The air passes by the neck and cools down faster.Airable fans turn 180 degrees, making it easier for you to customize the airflow. Our propeller was not built in a day. We've built and tested over 500 propellers. Instead of simply changing the angles, we modified the pressure applied to each wing, used different materials, calibrated the noise according to the shape of the wing, and developed the optimal propeller to apply to Airable. Airable is not only hands-free and wearable but also detachable. It’s straightforward to detach and assemble.Use Airable to make a fire, to share with friends, and much more.Did your neckband get dirty? Don't worry.  Our neckband is made from a flexible material that is durable and easy to clean.  Airable weighing a mere 5.7oz(about 161.6g), which is just a little more than a shirt. It gets lighter by distributing the weight using the magnet. Airable uses a safe, dedicated battery certified by UL, CE, KC, and PSE.In addition, a dedicated cable with two USB-C ports can also charge both sides of the Airable simultaneously.  Connect Airable with a power bank and take out the battery if you want to experience a lighter Airable.    

UK Met Office scientists predict that 2021 will be one of the top six warmest years on record. Overcome this summer with Airable and beat the heat. A perfect product for this summer. If you know anyone who gets hot easily and sweats a lot then this could be the perfect gift.
Everybody complains about the scorching weather but nobody does anything about it. Now, VOILA!

 

We developed and tested over 500 different propellers, and it is 1/10th the size of our competitor's propeller. We have visited our manufacturers and worked hard to get the best material and components.
 

 
 


Challenges I faced as an Inventor
We're a small team (South Korean) of dedicated individuals who've been on a rollercoaster. 
We researched, developed, and applied a technology that minimizes loss of airflow to the back of the neck based on the Coandă effect. The Coandă effect is the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to a convex surface.
We researched, developed, and applied technology that can minimize the loss of airflow towards the back of the neck. This loss of airflow is caused by the Coanda effect, which is when a jet flow attaches itself to a surface and remains attached even when the surface curves away towards another direction.
It needs to be wearable, so the design was VERY important. 
Making a small and beautiful product that fully contains a fan's function was a lot more complex than I thought.
If I made it bigger and not worry about the design, I could have made it without any trouble. But would I be proud of my product? The answer would be NO.
So I had to dig deep. 
The big reason why companies have not been able to successfully make small-sized wearable fans is most likely because of the noise. The noise generated can be loud and unpleasant because the fan needs to rotate at a high speed in order to create airflow within a small area.
We tried various methods such as applying a vibration pad to the mount that holds the motor, changing the mount's material to hard and soft, and creating a vibration dispersion shape.
Just as a small car engine has less power than the engine of a tank, it is difficult to make a strong airflow if the propeller is small.
In order to create a design that is both small and efficient, we have tested a wide variety of fans and propellers such as a wingless method, a blower fan, an axial fan, and a reverse dual fan. Airable's propeller is about 1/10th the size of our competitor's propeller. 
Rather than just changing the angle, we designed it by changing variables such as Camber, Skew, Chord, Lake, Pitch, and NACA airfoil, which are complex variables of the propeller. We developed it by conducting CFD and wind tunnel experiments. 
In addition, the battery's compatibility (voltage, electric power), the motor, and the wind intake are all more important than the propeller alone. We tailored the exclusive motor and the whole battery to balance the product, and tested it after making numerous changes to the mechanical parts.
 
The three men above have contributed greatly to our campaign. They have contacted us first through our advertisement and since then have shown great love and helped in many ways like strengthening our content, writing skills, and giving us honest feedback. To show our appreciation we wanted them in our campaign.  Thank you, guys! We couldn't have done it without you. 
 
We need to raise additional production funds through Indiegogo and make up for the somewhat low marketing budget through your help by word of mouth.
Tell your friends and family around you who are struggling with the heat. Every word from you will be of tremendous help in getting Airables into the market.
My dream is to make good products that can make people's lives more worthwhile. I know with your support I can be closer in achieving this dream. 
To show our support, backers will get Airable for a discounted price, and the earliest deliveries. Airable’s final MSRP pricing may change when it’s officially available on the market. 
Indiegogo is full of innovators and early adapters just like us. We’ve identified a stumbling block in our own lives and we’re not going to settle for the status quo.

<p> Every year - over 100,000 marine animals die from plastic ingestion.</p>
<p>If your bathtub was overflowing, you wouldn't immediately reach for a mop, you'd first turn off the tap. Beach-cleanings are good but have not much effect if we don't stop the flow of trash into the oceans. </p>

<p>We need to intercept plastic in rivers and coastal regions before it reaches the ocean, this plastic is called ocean bound plastic. </p>
<p>Buoy Bottle is made from 100% recycled ocean bound plastic recovered from these coastal regions with poor or no waste management. We are recovering plastic before it ends up in our oceans destroying our precious eco-system.</p>
<p>Plastic pollution has caused 5 giant plastic islands to form, floating around our oceans and harming marine life. Learn more about these ""Gyres"" from Buoy's mini team member - Alexa!</p>

<p>  8 million tons of plastic enter the ocean every year - Buoy aims to reduce this amount by making a circular economy. We only use 100% recycled post-consumer plastic, and once your bottle has reached the end of it’s life, whether it’s old or broken, send it back to us. You receive a discount on your next purchase with us, and we can recycle your bottle into a new one!</p>

Buoy is on a mission to replace single-use products made from virgin materials with modern-design and highly-functional reusable products made out of recycled materials. Our first product in our foodware line is the Buoy Bottle - a reusable water bottle made out of 100% recycled ocean-bound plastic.



The oceans generate up to 70% of the oxygen we breathe - therefore we need to protect them. Buoy Bottle is the most environmentally sustainable water bottle made from 100% ocean-bound plastic intercepted from beaches and rivers. Purchasing a Buoy Bottle directly helps out ocean life all while providing you a functional and stylish product.


 

Unique, 3-Part Design:
Cup / Bottle / Finger Loop
 
Buoy's 3-part design was created by award-winning architect and industrial designer Pascal Schaller. Minimalist and simplistic design meets functionality and sustainability.

Buoy bottle’s 3 part design means you get a bottle and a cup in one. It also makes it a breeze to add ice for a hot day.

Washing your bottle at the end of the day couldn't be easier - just unscrew and wash by hand, or pop it in your dishwasher.

 
Functional, Yet Stylish
 
Buoy Bottle isn’t only functional, good for the environment, and made to the highest quality - it also looks beautiful. Designed by award winning designer Pascal Schaller, our minimalist design and bold colors fit in at home, the office, on the go, and while playing your favorite sports.


The top of the bottle acts as both the lid and also a finger loop for easy carrying. Clip it on to a carabiner to carry on your bag, utility belt, whatever you want!

 
Full-Sized, Light-Weight
 
Buoy Bottle is a full size water bottle that can carry 27oz/820ml, but comes in super lightweight at only 250g

 
Safe for Oceans, Safe for You
 
Buoy Bottle is made from recycled HDPE, food-grade certified, BPA free plastic, which is high quality, safe, and super tough.

Buoy bottle can withstand heads of up to 302°F - which means it's dishwasher safe and can handle hot drinks! It's got a thick 3mm wall so has pretty good insulation - but if you're looking to carry around your morning brew, watch this space! Buoy's next product will be a coffee tumbler!

 
Ocean Bound Plastic
 
 Every year - over 100,000 marine animals die from plastic ingestion.
If your bathtub was overflowing, you wouldn't immediately reach for a mop, you'd first turn off the tap. Beach-cleanings are good but have not much effect if we don't stop the flow of trash into the oceans.

Buoy Bottle is made from 100% recycled ocean bound plastic recovered from these coastal regions with poor or no waste management. We are recovering plastic before it ends up in our oceans destroying our precious eco-system.
Plastic pollution has caused 5 giant plastic islands to form, floating around our oceans and harming marine life. Learn more about these ""Gyres"" from Buoy's mini team member - Alexa!

 
Buoy Bottle Recycling Scheme
 
  8 million tons of plastic enter the ocean every year - Buoy aims to reduce this amount by making a circular economy. We only use 100% recycled post-consumer plastic, and once your bottle has reached the end of it’s life, whether it’s old or broken, send it back to us. You receive a discount on your next purchase with us, and we can recycle your bottle into a new one!

Even if you put your Buoy Bottle in your recycling bin, it will most likely get recycled alongside everything else.
 
Why Buoy?
 

 
Let's Get Colorful
 
Buoy Bottle is launching with a bright and colorful primary color scheme.

Buoy Bottle's 3 part design means you can mix and match colors to make a fully unique bottle. Whether you buy a single bottle or more, you can customize it fully to your liking.
In the future - Buoy aims to bring our new colors and exclusive designs - watch this space!

<h3><i>Risks &amp; Challenges</i></h3>
<p>There is no technology risks. We are currently launching this into the world. We just completed beta testing and the tech works.  However, building out each tour does take a lot of time and loving attention - it is actually a lot like making a documentary film, including researching, writing, rewriting, test driving,  writing and recording original music, sound design, tech improvements and rebuilds. </p>

So be it Los Angeles locals seeking a change of pace driving Hollywood, or road trippers from San Diego, Arizona, and Oregon looking for a new way to experience the PCH, Wayfarer Journey will have you covered.
 

Risks & Challenges
There is no technology risks. We are currently launching this into the world. We just completed beta testing and the tech works.  However, building out each tour does take a lot of time and loving attention - it is actually a lot like making a documentary film, including researching, writing, rewriting, test driving,  writing and recording original music, sound design, tech improvements and rebuilds. 
Supporting this crowdfunding campaign will give us the boost we need to guarantee that Wayfarer Journey becomes an enduring friend to the traveler.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are creating oversized boutique campsites in untouched native north Florida with an ample amount of forested space between each site, just a mile from the Gulf of Mexico in the Florida Panhandle. Perfect for paddlers, fishing, and scolloping or just enjoying the great outdoors. The 1 acre undeveloped land has just been cleared and the driveway installed. We're anticipating to be up and running before the spring, just in time for scollop season and to host you, our backers. Once the internet and utilities are installed, building a common fire pit area thats all decked with LED festoon lighting and adding many bug repelling plants around the grounds will get us up and running. We are running this campaign to get us to the finish line in time for spring.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are husband and wife entrepreneurs who have, separately and together, started a handful and businesses. A few of which we still run presently. We have extensive experience in the hospitality/restaurant industry as well as real estate law, sales &amp; marketing, technology, and the power sports industry.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need help with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install a waste water septic system</li>
<li>Bring in electric service, including 30/50 amp hookups at all sites</li>
<li>Drill a water well and install a fresh water connections at all sites</li>
<li>In the long term (or if we exceed our initial goal) we will be adding a common area enclosed barn with a shower, toilet, laundry facility and fish cleaning station.</li>
<li>Also in the long term (or if we exceed our initial goal) Solar energy to assist in powering our grounds.</li>

<h3>The Campsites</h3>
<ul>
<li>We've already acquired the property and have selectively cleared the campsites and installed the driveway.</li>
<li>We intend to offer WiFi to all of our guests.</li>
<li>Each site will have water, sewer and 30/50 amp hookups as well as standard 20 amp outlets to accommodate tent campers.</li>
<li>Festoon lights will adorn the sites as well as the common areas.</li>
<li>On top of each site having their own fire ring, a large enchanted campfire in the common area will be available for use and will be fantastic for socializing with the other campers. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We feel our biggest challenges are timing to have the campground open for the local season, which is summer, and getting material to install the power and septic.<br/>The supplies we need are in very high demand right now as camping has increased by something like 1600% since the start of the pandemic, however we are confident that with our connections we will be able to source the materials that we need.</p>
<p>The reality is, we can do it on our own but the campground won't be finished in time for scollop season this summer if we don't get that boost to be able to open sooner. </p>

After the success of our first two Air Deck and three Nanobag campaigns, and more than 37k backers later, we’re now ready for our sixth campaign.  The Air Deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do  Created with feedback from the community, here are our seven new designs: 
Red Classic, Electric, Night Sky, Aqua Mandala, Geometric, Retro and Blue Classic
 Check out some of the feedback we've received from our Air Deck 2.0 backers.
 
 
52 Playing Cards + 2 jokers
Waterproof and washable
Compact travel friendly size
Lightweight
Durable heavy-duty 'casino quality' 0.31mm PVC
Premium printing
Slightly textured on both sides for better handling
Sturdy 0.4mm waterproof synthetic paper tuck box
Playing card size : 3.43 x 1.26 inches (87 x 32mm)
 PS. When pledging, just select the number of decks you want. You get to choose designs in the checkout.   Our mission is to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers
 The Air Deck 3.0 takes up very little space and easily fits into your pocket
  Air Deck 3.0 is made with the same high-quality materials as the original, but there’s a few new things:
Five fresh new designs voted on by our community.
The boxes now have indents to make them easier to open.
We'll be planting even more mangrove trees to offset our emissions many times over. We believe being a climate positive company is important. 1 tree gets planted for every two decks sold.
 Five fresh new designs voted on by our community
 The boxes now have an indent to make them easier to open 
Thank you for helping us reach both our stretch goals!
  With the Air Deck 3.0 we did not want to compromise on quality. We went to several of the world’s best manufacturers of premium casino cards and asked for the best materials they could provide. In the process of creating the ultimate travel deck, we tried out over 50 different high-end plastic materials. The materials were taken through scratch, bending and handling tests to identify the best candidate. Finally, we ended up with a premium ‘casino quality’ PVC that has all the properties we want for our deck.     The Air Deck 3.0 is meticulously cut
 The Air Deck is made of a casino quality PVC  The Air Deck is incredibly resistant to tearing and bending, and is 100% waterproof. You can play with these in the pool, in the boat, in the tub, in the rain, at the beach, pretty much wherever you can think of.  Regular paper playing cards tear, stain, and break easily, but Air Deck 3.0 is extremely durable
 The cards are 100% waterproof, so you can use them in the pool, bathtub or even the beach.
 You can also wash the cards. 
  The cards are slightly textured on both sides to provide cushioning and excellent handlingIn the process of selecting the material we sought advice from several playing card professionals. The end result is a deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do.

<p>Most outdoor gear companies outsource their manufacturing to foreign sources because of the lower cost of labor and materials. <strong>We don't do that.</strong></p>
<p>We believe in putting people before profits and employing folks with good pay for the hard work and dedication they put into making these amazing products. </p>
<p>We're a ""cottage shop"" with a small environmental footprint, making durable products with the highest quality materials and offering repair or replace guarantees so our products won’t end up in a landfill, or worse left on the trail. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">=========================================</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">We've Come So Far</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">And there is so much more to this story</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>I refused to buy a backpacking chair simply because it wasn’t light enough, felt wobbly, had no lower back support, or its feet sunk down into the ground or snow. I had literally flipped over and dumped out on more than one occasion when trying out other backpacking chairs. I couldn’t stand that these other chairs would only ever be just a chair. I set out to design a chair that was ultralight, no, Adaptive Light, incredibly stable, supported my back, and didn’t feel like I was sitting on the ground or squatting with my knees up to my chest. The goal was to minimize overall weight carried while using every piece of equipment to its fullest extent possible.</p>
<p>Providing the most comfortable, dependable, and durable chair ever made for the backcountry.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619826409/xcnjp8oetlix9eud18kn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It all started with the first full size trekking pole chair, the MUHL, which uses a set of 3 piece telescoping trekking poles and pairs it with a freakishly strong yet lightweight frame. It’s then covered by a durable fabric seat with unique shaped pockets (holsters) that fit the trekking pole handle into.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619826439/fnpunxvyo0vc1ujxzw2g.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>We couldn’t stop there and our testing and development led us to even more interchangeability. Again, we wanted the most capability that we could possibly get out of a single frame.</p>
<p>That’s when the other camping chairs evolved into the CAPRA lightweight backpacking chair with a full frame. The HINNY Recon lightweight backpacking stool, and the SEAGOAT ISLANDER beach chair. All sharing the same freakishly strong frame.</p>

We believe in putting people before profits and employing folks with good pay for the hard work and dedication they put into making these amazing products. 
We're a ""cottage shop"" with a small environmental footprint, making durable products with the highest quality materials and offering repair or replace guarantees so our products won’t end up in a landfill, or worse left on the trail.

=========================================
 
We've Come So Far
And there is so much more to this story
 
I refused to buy a backpacking chair simply because it wasn’t light enough, felt wobbly, had no lower back support, or its feet sunk down into the ground or snow. I had literally flipped over and dumped out on more than one occasion when trying out other backpacking chairs. I couldn’t stand that these other chairs would only ever be just a chair. I set out to design a chair that was ultralight, no, Adaptive Light, incredibly stable, supported my back, and didn’t feel like I was sitting on the ground or squatting with my knees up to my chest. The goal was to minimize overall weight carried while using every piece of equipment to its fullest extent possible.
Providing the most comfortable, dependable, and durable chair ever made for the backcountry.

It all started with the first full size trekking pole chair, the MUHL, which uses a set of 3 piece telescoping trekking poles and pairs it with a freakishly strong yet lightweight frame. It’s then covered by a durable fabric seat with unique shaped pockets (holsters) that fit the trekking pole handle into.


We couldn’t stop there and our testing and development led us to even more interchangeability. Again, we wanted the most capability that we could possibly get out of a single frame.
That’s when the other camping chairs evolved into the CAPRA lightweight backpacking chair with a full frame. The HINNY Recon lightweight backpacking stool, and the SEAGOAT ISLANDER beach chair. All sharing the same freakishly strong frame.

<p>We took remarkable steps to prove our team's ideas, business plan, policies, and target market data And hosts agree - it’s the right niche and the timing is right to build our App!</p>
<p>However, we’re not technical founders! We’re Hosts banding together to take on giants!</p>
<p><i><strong>Why Essential Workers?</strong></i></p>
<p>All vacation rental platforms/apps on the App Store don’t take into account all the nuances that Companies (and governments) require for their essential workers. This leads to countless hours of unnecessary coordination, low morale amongst employees, and lessens productivity.</p>
<p><i><strong>Why do Essential Workers need us? Why not use Airbnb?</strong></i></p>
<p>“Airbnb appeals to the lowest common denominator like a Motel 6. Workforce and executive clients that choose Workbnb (in the near future) will expect something better,” say Donald Beken, a Corporate Talent Acquisition Manager, frequent business traveler (and my advisor).</p>
<p><i><strong>How did I discover this underserved client?</strong></i></p>
<p>My experience with essential workers started in spring of 2019 when my mom called and said she bought me a plane ticket to come to Reno! She was telling me about all these companies that were moving there because of the great tax incentives and affordable housing. Plus Tesla and other big companies were all relocating here at the same time. She just started her business, PKL Homes, with 3 Airbnb’s and was doing pretty good until a company offered her a contract to house 65 people for three months. Now, please understand, Reno is a small market But it’s a growth market and it’s on every list of growing cities in America.</p>
<p>There was no corporate housing giant in town and the contract had to be filled quickly. So it was my task to help her scale up to 23 apartments in three weeks. My mom had carpel tunnel surgery so I had to be her hands as well as her marketing guy. Since I had marketing experience, she was able to get free marketing expertise included. But then I began to notice a trend… More than half of our bookings on Airbnb were business travelers and essential workers.</p>
<p>So after months of collecting data, conducting surveys, and working with economic development officials, I started direct marketing using the term “workforce rentals.” That’s when we became the solution company.</p>
<p><a href=""https://medium.com/@pklhomes/a-solution-to-workforce-housing-in-reno-flexible-short-term-rentals-with-pkl-homes-b9c8d1c7f80f"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622237530/pifw0muhkdvfcjwddpke.jpg"" src=""""/></a></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Join the Workbnb Movement - Pledge Your Support Today!</i></p>
<p>But we had to adjust our model completely from the vacation rental model. We gave all of our clients the right to extend at the same price without marketing the unit from under them. That gave our clients confidence that if something happened during their trip or a project delays, they could stay in the unit that they enjoyed with these longer extended stays.</p>

<p>Reno, Nevada’s rapid expansion means construction projects and corporate relocation, but less housing for the workforce making it happen.</p>
<p>The article presented serious questions: So when construction crews move into the area to build much-needed housing, where do they live? How do they find flexible short term housing that can accommodate scope creep and project delays?</p>
<p>When corporations relocate to Reno and need to find luxury temporary housing for C-suite executives and project managers who are in the area to lead change management and enterprise relocation, who understands their unique needs?</p>
<p>We scaled our operation to 40+ units throughout Reno Sparks and Carson City to meet workforce housing demand!</p>
<p>""PKL's dedication to providing the highest-quality workforce housing in Reno has saved me countless hours of coordination, improved the morale of employees and has provided exceptional value to my organization,"" said Seth Alexander, project manager of Ames Construction, the 74th largest Industrial General Contractor in the United States.</p>
<p><a href=""https://amesconstruction.com/how-we-work"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://amesconstruction.com/how-we-work</a></p>
<p>Then it dawned on me, If I could build an app for this demographic, we could mobilize the short term rental industry and train them to cater to an underserved market. That’s when I left my cushy job at PKL to write the business plan with Daj’Anique Staples.</p>
<p><i><strong>Why name the app Workbnb???</strong></i></p>
<p>The name came to me late in the development of the business plan. I needed to capture the essence of what we do in one word. I need the name to stick.</p>

<p>RENO, NV May 20, 2021 --- “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” said Daj’Anique Staples, Workbnb, Inc’s 23 year old President. ""There are millions of vacation rental hosts worldwide and a very large number are upset due to lack of support and grotesque treatment from the larger platforms. There are many other hosts simply open to diversifying their income sources. Plus there's an underserved traveler seeking whole homes with extended stay options and that have better terms and conditions,” said Ms. Staples.</p>
<p>Workbnb promises to be “the better booking platform” designed for the nuances of Corporate travel and companies sending out their most valued employees in droves to conduct essential projects, meetings, and tasks. Employers, eager to resume growth, are actively seeking solutions to increase employee satisfaction and the key is whole homes with extended dates.</p>
<p>During the pandemic, construction was one of several industries deemed essential by every Governor. Growth states such as NV, CA, TX, WA , NY, and FL all permitted record construction projects while Americans were on lockdown. “This is not a trend, essential workers led the way at great risk and many did contract COVID. Now, it’s time for them to be properly accommodated.  Short term rentals are just as necessary as long term leases, apartment complexes should want to support this client , rather than ban STR operators eager to facilitate,” said Ms. Staples.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to service this client base, Workbnb requires property managers of whole homes to be <i><strong>Workbnb Certified as a Hometelier</strong></i>. After the 2 week certification course is complete, Homemakers (definition below) will be able to list their units, according to Workbnb standards. Owners will be able to request services from and visibly see who is a verified Hometelier<i><strong> through the app</strong></i>.  “Creating mandatory guidelines and training for this title gives professionals in this industry a sense of purpose for what we do. Being a hometelier is the foundation for these short term rental businesses to succeed and continue to thrive."" <i><strong>Homemakers</strong></i> will have access to millions of trained professionals that can help start their business or get it back on track through the platform, ""I can’t even find Hosts to co-host for without sending a fake booking request on Airbnb,” Daj’Anique Staples ended.</p>

<p>“The Company will charge a 5% service fee per booking and an affordable listing fee, however the mobile application will operate within a Freemium business model,” said Yeves Perez, the Company’s CEO. “We know we're up against Goliaths, however this is not the vacation rental lane. Traveling workers, employees relocating, construction workers, executives...they all need a platform just for them,” said Mr. Perez. Airbnb is reported to have over 4 million active hosts according to a recent article by <a href=""https://news.airbnb.com/about-us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Airbnb News</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> According to the Economic Policy Institute’s May 2020 comprehensive, <a href=""https://www.epi.org/blog/who-are-essential-workers-a-comprehensive-look-at-their-wages-demographics-and-unionization-rates/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Who Are Essential Workers?""</a> , California identifies 55 million essential workers in the entire industry.</p>

<p>Starting in Q2 2022, users will get basic features at no cost and access to richer functionality, tools, and resources for a monthly subscription fee. To date, the young tech company based in Reno, Nevada, is launching a strategic crowd-funding campaign aimed at Hosts worldwide. “We want to show proof of concept, we need 100,000 hosts to back us at $100...us hosts spend that on pillows,” Mr. Perez said.</p>

However, we’re not technical founders! We’re Hosts banding together to take on giants!
Why Essential Workers?
All vacation rental platforms/apps on the App Store don’t take into account all the nuances that Companies (and governments) require for their essential workers. This leads to countless hours of unnecessary coordination, low morale amongst employees, and lessens productivity.
Why do Essential Workers need us? Why not use Airbnb?
“Airbnb appeals to the lowest common denominator like a Motel 6. Workforce and executive clients that choose Workbnb (in the near future) will expect something better,” say Donald Beken, a Corporate Talent Acquisition Manager, frequent business traveler (and my advisor).
How did I discover this underserved client?
My experience with essential workers started in spring of 2019 when my mom called and said she bought me a plane ticket to come to Reno! She was telling me about all these companies that were moving there because of the great tax incentives and affordable housing. Plus Tesla and other big companies were all relocating here at the same time. She just started her business, PKL Homes, with 3 Airbnb’s and was doing pretty good until a company offered her a contract to house 65 people for three months. Now, please understand, Reno is a small market But it’s a growth market and it’s on every list of growing cities in America.
There was no corporate housing giant in town and the contract had to be filled quickly. So it was my task to help her scale up to 23 apartments in three weeks. My mom had carpel tunnel surgery so I had to be her hands as well as her marketing guy. Since I had marketing experience, she was able to get free marketing expertise included. But then I began to notice a trend… More than half of our bookings on Airbnb were business travelers and essential workers.
So after months of collecting data, conducting surveys, and working with economic development officials, I started direct marketing using the term “workforce rentals.” That’s when we became the solution company.

But we had to adjust our model completely from the vacation rental model. We gave all of our clients the right to extend at the same price without marketing the unit from under them. That gave our clients confidence that if something happened during their trip or a project delays, they could stay in the unit that they enjoyed with these longer extended stays.
https://medium.com/@pklhomes/a-solution-to-workforce-housing-in-reno-flexible-short-term-rentals-with-pkl-homes-b9c8d1c7f80f
Reno, Nevada’s rapid expansion means construction projects and corporate relocation, but less housing for the workforce making it happen.
The article presented serious questions: So when construction crews move into the area to build much-needed housing, where do they live? How do they find flexible short term housing that can accommodate scope creep and project delays?
When corporations relocate to Reno and need to find luxury temporary housing for C-suite executives and project managers who are in the area to lead change management and enterprise relocation, who understands their unique needs?
We scaled our operation to 40+ units throughout Reno Sparks and Carson City to meet workforce housing demand!
""PKL's dedication to providing the highest-quality workforce housing in Reno has saved me countless hours of coordination, improved the morale of employees and has provided exceptional value to my organization,"" said Seth Alexander, project manager of Ames Construction, the 74th largest Industrial General Contractor in the United States.

Then it dawned on me, If I could build an app for this demographic, we could mobilize the short term rental industry and train them to cater to an underserved market. That’s when I left my cushy job at PKL to write the business plan with Daj’Anique Staples.
Why name the app Workbnb???
The name came to me late in the development of the business plan. I needed to capture the essence of what we do in one word. I need the name to stick.

RENO, NV May 20, 2021 --- “This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” said Daj’Anique Staples, Workbnb, Inc’s 23 year old President. ""There are millions of vacation rental hosts worldwide and a very large number are upset due to lack of support and grotesque treatment from the larger platforms. There are many other hosts simply open to diversifying their income sources. Plus there's an underserved traveler seeking whole homes with extended stay options and that have better terms and conditions,” said Ms. Staples.
Workbnb promises to be “the better booking platform” designed for the nuances of Corporate travel and companies sending out their most valued employees in droves to conduct essential projects, meetings, and tasks. Employers, eager to resume growth, are actively seeking solutions to increase employee satisfaction and the key is whole homes with extended dates.
During the pandemic, construction was one of several industries deemed essential by every Governor. Growth states such as NV, CA, TX, WA , NY, and FL all permitted record construction projects while Americans were on lockdown. “This is not a trend, essential workers led the way at great risk and many did contract COVID. Now, it’s time for them to be properly accommodated.  Short term rentals are just as necessary as long term leases, apartment complexes should want to support this client , rather than ban STR operators eager to facilitate,” said Ms. Staples.
 
In order to service this client base, Workbnb requires property managers of whole homes to be Workbnb Certified as a Hometelier. After the 2 week certification course is complete, Homemakers (definition below) will be able to list their units, according to Workbnb standards. Owners will be able to request services from and visibly see who is a verified Hometelier through the app.  “Creating mandatory guidelines and training for this title gives professionals in this industry a sense of purpose for what we do. Being a hometelier is the foundation for these short term rental businesses to succeed and continue to thrive."" Homemakers will have access to millions of trained professionals that can help start their business or get it back on track through the platform, ""I can’t even find Hosts to co-host for without sending a fake booking request on Airbnb,” Daj’Anique Staples ended.

“The Company will charge a 5% service fee per booking and an affordable listing fee, however the mobile application will operate within a Freemium business model,” said Yeves Perez, the Company’s CEO. “We know we're up against Goliaths, however this is not the vacation rental lane. Traveling workers, employees relocating, construction workers, executives...they all need a platform just for them,” said Mr. Perez. Airbnb is reported to have over 4 million active hosts according to a recent article by Airbnb News.
 
 According to the Economic Policy Institute’s May 2020 comprehensive, ""Who Are Essential Workers?"" , California identifies 55 million essential workers in the entire industry.

To date, the young tech company based in Reno, Nevada, is launching a strategic crowd-funding campaign aimed at Hosts worldwide. “We want to show proof of concept, we need 100,000 hosts to back us at $100...us hosts spend that on pillows,” Mr. Perez said.
The Company is 100% minority owned and 50% of the Board of Directors are made up of women of color. The Founders are existing hosts and co-hosts based in Reno, Nevada. Workbnb team also administers a (used to be) private Facebook group for Hosts worldwide to give open feedback on policies, features, and benefits of the app. This is a hospitality tech company to watch.
