<h1>What is Yen Yurki?</h1>
<p>Yen Yurki is an adventure game based around the absurd logic of bullies. You may be told something like <em>""This guy thinks he's captain Knots, captain tying knots, when everyone needs their knots tied they go to him, no way."" </em>And then later on in a puzzle, you'll have to put on a captain hat and tie someone's knots so that you can get to your next class and solve another absurd puzzle.</p>
<p>But if you've ever played an adventure game you'd think this was an absurd proposition, to make an adventure game with absurd items and absurd rules? No way! Get real!</p>
<p>But the game will be less mind-numbing than you might expect, everything that you can actually click on will be in pixelated to offer a contrast and distinction between what you can and can't use, you won't have to click everywhere to find your ropes and captain hat, it will be in plain sight. </p>
<p>As for the absurd puzzles, you will continually be insulted throughout the game  but that's actually a  jumbled version of your objective.</p>
<p>Of course this is not the only type of puzzle, if it was the game would easily get dull and would require little brain-power. However, you'll usually be presented with 2 or more puzzles at once, (action trees) with this style being among them. </p>
<p>The game is also based around the idea of moral choices with a silent protagonist. There will be a lot of choices and options based purely on how you complete a puzzle. The other characters will talk to you differently and let you go to different areas all depending on whether or not you ""used x on y, rather than x on z."" or if you ""combine x with y and than use it on z."" This will add a lot of variety to every possible play through. </p>
<h1>Action trees?</h1>
<p>Maybe we should have done said that first... </p>
<p>In addition to the subtle details that will change in the game based on minor things that you do throughout the game. We are also planing to include something we like to call ""action trees."" </p>
<p>Action trees are a more active approach to dialogue trees, instead of during a conversation deciding whether to be good, bad, or neutral you'd be deciding whether to get through a door by, using a key, a camel's toe or punching it in the face. This is a fine example of the ""logical, aggressive, and Sierra"" system we will be using most of the time (meaning that during some scenarios there may be more) for the puzzle options.</p>
<p><strong>Logical: </strong>The logical way of solving puzzles are probably what you expect, you solve a puzzle how you might solve it in real life, or in some cases a well made adventure game. How do you get passed the guard and get into the building? You distract the guard by convincing the man next to him to act like he's about to break in, then you use the key you inexplicably had from earlier. You know, how you would in real life. </p>
<p><strong>Sierra: </strong>The Sierra way of solving puzzles are probably what you'd expect... from an old Sierra game or terrible flash game. How do you get passed the guard and get into the building? You stick the old camel toe into your left ear, while the man next to you sticks a golden plate to his head, drinks goat milk and tosses you a crow bar to get through the door. (The key was a red herring.) This is the kind of puzzle you'll be trained to understand in the beginning through the riddles that Sir. Huntington uses to insult you early on (remember the captain knots metaphor from the beginning?) But be warned, these aren't always instructed, you're gonna have to get creative. Note: you can still go about any other way of solving a puzzle even when a Sierra one is instructed</p>
<p><strong>Aggressive: </strong>The aggressive way of solving puzzles is along the lines of what you'd expect from a renegade option in Mass Effect. How do you get passed the guard to get into the building? Punch the guard in his stupid face! This is more or less your handicap. However, it will usually come back to bite you by the end. Later on you'll come across a really difficult puzzle, with no aggressive option and no hints. Also, you'll usually need to go through other minor puzzles to even be able to initiate the aggressive puzzle. So, you'll have to get the leather in room 1, and an old glove in room 2, and then combine the two items to make a boxing glove. Then later on, you put the glove on Hungre Jack then click on the guard to punch him in the stupid face. However, later on  because you punched the guard in the stupid face, you have to solve a more difficult puzzle. Is any of this getting to you?</p>
<h1>So why<em> My </em>Money? And how will it be used?</h1>
<p>Let's get the first question out of the way first: </p>
<p>If two kids walked into your office and said "" <em>We want to make an adventure game with absurd logic, and we want to design the puzzle and story on our own.</em>"" Would you take them seriously? Exactly. </p>
<p>As for the money's purpose: we're asking for the bare minimum to get the software we'll need to make the game as great as possible, and also to set up a modest website for the game, so on and so forth. The further we get past our goal, the more we can do. We can make ports to IOS and Android (whichever has more demand when we reach the appropriate milestone. Said milestones will be announced when/if we surpass our original goal.) If we get enough, we may also be able to translate the game into other languages, so on and so forth, if we have more money than we can forcefully push back in. That money will probably go into ports for other devices like Linux and XBLA post launch, or free DLC.</p>
<h1>What makes the game unique?</h1>
<p>There are a lot of quirky attributes to this game that make it interesting.</p>
<p>One of the most significant ones is the boss battles, you don't typically see boss battles in a point n' click adventure game. There are going to be a whole bunch of boss battles that cycle through different genres, like Shmup, to RPG, to platformer, and something we never see; a point n' click boss battle. </p>
<p>Also there will be a leveling system. You gain levels by finding dialogue using the word ____, doing things off the beaten path, and so on and so forth. Leveling up may change how people talk to you, change what is accessible, or change the games ending. So it will be very important to do everything you can in the game. </p>
<p>As we mentioned before, the items and NPCs will stand out from the backgrounds through the use of different art styles, but there will also be a lot of cutscene variety that takes advantage of that stylization. We're going with a unique style as far as cutscenes are concerned, every cutscene that isn't made with in game graphics will have pixelated characters over a digitized real world background, it's hard to explain, but imagine a Sega CD cutscene with the people replaced with 8-bit characters. (It's easier to see in the video.)</p>
<div class=""template""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/LjiSU.png"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>It's also very important to know that virtually all of the antagonist dialogue are actually insults that have been used against us, like ""ge'in hungi"" (as in getting hungry.) and ""gen jerky"" (I know as well as you do.) Also the story will be loosely based on the troops of Masahiro Sakurai's work.</p>
<h1>Tell me about the game's characters?</h1>
<p>You play as Hungre Jack (yes, that was a real insult) a silent protagonist and a victim to bullies, like Sir. Huntington and Julinavi.</p>
<p>Sir. Huntington is the game's main antagonist, he's a giant gooey blob with tiny arms and giant tentacle legs. He more or less takes the role of the Riddler, most of the insults/puzzles will come out of him.</p>
<p><img alt=""No"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/pCkTD.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Sir.Huntington""/></p>
<p>Julinavi is somewhere between an antagonist, and a guide. He constantly insults you, yet he's helping you because it reminds you to stay on task, and let's you know what you're supposed to do. Definitely a unique character. </p>
<p><img alt=""No."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/dsGCC.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Julinavi""/></p>
<h1>So how do I know you won't spend the money on candy?</h1>
<p>We have created a very specific list of what we will do with the money when we reach specific goals, additionally my parents will be reviewing our list to make sure we're using the money wisely, and it will also be in her bank account to make sure we're using it wisely, you can rest assured the money won't be spent on candy.</p>

<p><strong>Update 6 - Stretch Goal?</strong></p>
<p>10 days left to go and 42% of the campaign goal covered. If you're out there, NOW is the time to contribute!</p>
<p class=""separator""><a href=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aRHUH0NTbwQ/UZseLq-dwmI/AAAAAAAADc0/vL-xuUnmrpE/s1600/contribute420.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img alt="""" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aRHUH0NTbwQ/UZseLq-dwmI/AAAAAAAADc0/vL-xuUnmrpE/s320/contribute420.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>According to the poll, about 60 people said they wanted a Modular Gaming Table if the price was right. 3 of them bought a table. This leaves us with 57 prospects. Obviously, for them the price is not right.</p>
<p>I did my best to lower the price as much a possible. I'm in the position to buy the materials at a discount, I got access to the machinery and know-how to work with the materials. Believe me, the current price is at its minimum. To give you an idea, making a table like this at a local welder will cost you about 800 - 900 euros.</p>
<p>However, there's another way to lower the price, but this requires an investment of about 3000,- euros. The investment involves the development of a plastic connection bar. Something similiar to the one below. The new connection bar not only reduces material and labor costs, but also improves overall stability and weight capacity considerably.</p>

<p>Early adopters of a MGT set buy a table, but more importantly they contribute to the further development of the table. Furthermore, early adopters will receive future upgrades like the new connection bar above for <strong>free</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm willing to invest if the campaign succeeds, but are you willing to contribute?</p>
<p><strong>Update 5 - Going Live!</strong></p>
<p>I thought about making a video before and I probably should have made one at the beginning of the MGT campaign, but I didn't, until now. What better way to demonstrate the table, than to simple show.</p>

<p>For the past few days I've been receiving questions about International Shipping rates. Even though the world seems more connected than ever, sending a package around world without selling your kidney is not as easy as it seems. Especially when the package falls outside the maximum allowed size restrictions.</p>
<p>However, there is still hope! There are still companies offering reasonable shipping rates with flexible size restrictions. Therefore, I can now offer a fixed shipping fee for shipment to the USA. I've added a new perk for shipment to the USA.</p>
<p>Please <a href=""mailto:mgt@dreamfish.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contact me</a> if you desire to know your International Shipping fee and I'll do my best to find the best deal.</p>

<p class=""separator"">It seems like the campaign is starting to take off. Many thanks for your contributions. This leaves us with only 6 more tables to go!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kMfPnNa8AMc/UX_X_lHecAI/AAAAAAAADX4/-1KelfkfQ34/s320/old-new-leg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Some might have noticed a difference in the legs on the pictures shown on the blog or on the gallery section of the campaign website. This is due to some improvements that have been applied after the prototype table was made. The new version has adjustable legs while the prototype table has static legs. The picture above shows both versions side-by-side.</p>
<p>So why the need for adjustable legs? First, the adjustable legs are lighter, have lower production costs and are removable for easy packaging. Secondly, the legs adjust themselves to uneven floors for stable footing. Thirdly, they are required when combining multiple MGT sets together to form one table.</p>
<p>Let me elaborate the last statement. We know the table has a slight downcurve due to the 1 mm space margin between each connection point. The longer the table, the bigger the downcurve. When combining two or more tables together to form one big table, you have four extra legs at your disposal. These extra four legs are used to give extra support to the table. See the picture below.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MORfi8O_SRk/TwTVkjAj5TI/AAAAAAAAAVM/6vqAOOEc_wE/s320/13.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You need adjustable legs to span the distance without disturbing the downcurve, otherwise you get a ""telephone line"" effect which might push the gameboards apart from each other. Adjusting the outer legs at a higher level and the inner legs at a lower level, prevents the ""telephone line"" effect from happening.</p>
<p>The leg consists out of three components. The aluminium bar, a metal-threaded insert and a standard machine feet. All of which are easily replaceable when damaged.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AaMeP09YaHo/UX_gDmshg8I/AAAAAAAADYI/2yGW6RMBjLE/s320/leg-parts.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Update 1 - 3D Gaming:</strong></p>
<p class=""separator"">My first update is about 3D gaming. I wrote about this a bit in the post <a href=""http://realmsofminiatures.blogspot.nl/2012/07/modular-gaming-board-part-11.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Modular Gaming Table: Part 11</a>. At the time I demonstrated the table in a 2x2 layered configuration. Not particularly the ideal setup when playing in 3D, because you wouldn't be able to reach all parts of the table. This post will demonstrate a configuration better suited for 3D gaming.</p>
<p class=""separator"">The pictures below show two two-layered configuration types which can be made from one MGT set. Both players can stand at either side of the table and still be able to reach all parts. The table can represent a variety of things like a dungeon, space hulk, building or an underground complex. Obviously my boards don't represent any one of these and specific boards must be made for that.</p>
<p class=""separator"">I hope this demonstrates some of the possibilities, enough to spark your imagination?</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Alex Koning, I'm 32 years old and I live with my familiy in the Netherlands. At the start of 2012 I designed and developed a <a href=""http://realmsofminiatures.blogspot.nl/2012/01/modular-gaming-table-part-1.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Modular Gaming Table"">Modular Gaming Table</a>. Enthusiastic reactions inspired me to look for ways to make it available to others.</p>
<p><strong style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What's a Modular Gaming Table?</strong></p>
<p>It's a configurable table with four or more legs consisting out of separable 2'x2' sections.</p>
<p>The table is designed to support (modular) gaming boards, but can be used for a variety of things;</p>
<p>The table is configurable and can be endlessly expanded, to form up an array of table configurations.</p>
<p>The table has two modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>table mode</li>
<li>storage mode</li>
</ul>
<p>This campaign is not about the development of the table, but getting it to your doorstep as cheap as possible!</p>
<p>The table has already proven itself to work. An in depth explanation of the Modular Gaming Table series can be found on my <a href=""http://realmsofminiatures.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""personal blog"">personal blog</a>.</p>
<p>The gallery section shows some pictures of the prototype table. These pictures were taken during the development and differ slightly from the actual table.</p>
<p>Please take a look at the instruction manual or videos to get a detailed description on how to setup a MGT.</p>

<h3>Specifications</h3>
<p>Below some technical specifications of the table:</p>
<ul>
<li>Material: Aluminium</li>
<li>Coating: Powder Coating</li>
<li>Total weight: 10 Kg</li>
<li>Min/max table height: 79/86 cm</li>
<li>Frame size: 61x61 cm (2'x2' feet)</li>
<li>Safe maximum weight: 21 Kg *</li>
<li>Downcurve without boards: 6/7 mm **</li>
<li>Downcurve with 3,5 Kg boards: 14/15 mm **</li>
<li>Table stability: 5 mm ***</li>
<li>Max height between frames (storage mode): 11 cm</li>
</ul>
<p>*) The maximum weight is tested on a 2x3 configuration with six boards each weighing 3,5 Kg. The actual maximum weight has not been tested and might easily exceed 21 Kg.</p>
<p>**) Between each connection bar and frame there's 1 mm of movement space. This causes the table to bend downwards. A 2x3 table setup without boards has a downcurve of 6/7 mm measured from the centre and 14/15 mm with six 3,5 Kg boards.</p>
<p>***) Between each connection bar and frame there's 1 mm of movement space. This causes the table to move a little. The table has a 5 mm movement margin in all directions.</p>

</div></div>","Update 6 - Stretch Goal?
10 days left to go and 42% of the campaign goal covered. If you're out there, NOW is the time to contribute!

According to the poll, about 60 people said they wanted a Modular Gaming Table if the price was right. 3 of them bought a table. This leaves us with 57 prospects. Obviously, for them the price is not right.
I did my best to lower the price as much a possible. I'm in the position to buy the materials at a discount, I got access to the machinery and know-how to work with the materials. Believe me, the current price is at its minimum. To give you an idea, making a table like this at a local welder will cost you about 800 - 900 euros.
However, there's another way to lower the price, but this requires an investment of about 3000,- euros. The investment involves the development of a plastic connection bar. Something similiar to the one below. The new connection bar not only reduces material and labor costs, but also improves overall stability and weight capacity considerably.

 

Early adopters of a MGT set buy a table, but more importantly they contribute to the further development of the table. Furthermore, early adopters will receive future upgrades like the new connection bar above for free.
I'm willing to invest if the campaign succeeds, but are you willing to contribute?
Update 5 - Going Live!
I thought about making a video before and I probably should have made one at the beginning of the MGT campaign, but I didn't, until now. What better way to demonstrate the table, than to simple show.

I made three videos in total. One showing the construction of a 2x3 setup, one showing the deconstruction and another one showing the construction of the storage setup. I'm also demonstrating my personal gaming boards both in the table and storage video. Enjoy!
Note: the gaming boards are NOT included and are intended for demonstration purposes only.

Video 1 - 2x3 table (construction)



Video 2 - 2x3 table (deconstruction)



Video 3 - storage (construction)


Update 4 - Examples
So, you want a MGT set, but can't really decide yet? Let me show you what one MGT set gives you in terms of table configurations, besides what has already been demonstrated.

Having two MGT sets opens up a whole set of configurations. One of such is the ""star"" configuration shown below.

Update 3 - International Shipping:

For the past few days I've been receiving questions about International Shipping rates. Even though the world seems more connected than ever, sending a package around world without selling your kidney is not as easy as it seems. Especially when the package falls outside the maximum allowed size restrictions.
However, there is still hope! There are still companies offering reasonable shipping rates with flexible size restrictions. Therefore, I can now offer a fixed shipping fee for shipment to the USA. I've added a new perk for shipment to the USA.
Please contact me if you desire to know your International Shipping fee and I'll do my best to find the best deal.
Update 2 - WAF:

It seems like the campaign is starting to take off. Many thanks for your contributions. This leaves us with only 6 more tables to go!

Some might have noticed a difference in the legs on the pictures shown on the blog or on the gallery section of the campaign website. This is due to some improvements that have been applied after the prototype table was made. The new version has adjustable legs while the prototype table has static legs. The picture above shows both versions side-by-side.
So why the need for adjustable legs? First, the adjustable legs are lighter, have lower production costs and are removable for easy packaging. Secondly, the legs adjust themselves to uneven floors for stable footing. Thirdly, they are required when combining multiple MGT sets together to form one table.
Let me elaborate the last statement. We know the table has a slight downcurve due to the 1 mm space margin between each connection point. The longer the table, the bigger the downcurve. When combining two or more tables together to form one big table, you have four extra legs at your disposal. These extra four legs are used to give extra support to the table. See the picture below.

You need adjustable legs to span the distance without disturbing the downcurve, otherwise you get a ""telephone line"" effect which might push the gameboards apart from each other. Adjusting the outer legs at a higher level and the inner legs at a lower level, prevents the ""telephone line"" effect from happening.
The leg consists out of three components. The aluminium bar, a metal-threaded insert and a standard machine feet. All of which are easily replaceable when damaged.

Update 1 - 3D Gaming:
My first update is about 3D gaming. I wrote about this a bit in the post Modular Gaming Table: Part 11. At the time I demonstrated the table in a 2x2 layered configuration. Not particularly the ideal setup when playing in 3D, because you wouldn't be able to reach all parts of the table. This post will demonstrate a configuration better suited for 3D gaming.
The pictures below show two two-layered configuration types which can be made from one MGT set. Both players can stand at either side of the table and still be able to reach all parts. The table can represent a variety of things like a dungeon, space hulk, building or an underground complex. Obviously my boards don't represent any one of these and specific boards must be made for that.
I hope this demonstrates some of the possibilities, enough to spark your imagination?


Introduction
My name is Alex Koning, I'm 32 years old and I live with my familiy in the Netherlands. At the start of 2012 I designed and developed a Modular Gaming Table. Enthusiastic reactions inspired me to look for ways to make it available to others.
What's a Modular Gaming Table?
It's a configurable table with four or more legs consisting out of separable 2'x2' sections.
The table is designed to support (modular) gaming boards, but can be used for a variety of things;
The table is configurable and can be endlessly expanded, to form up an array of table configurations.
The table has two modes:

table mode
storage mode

This campaign is not about the development of the table, but getting it to your doorstep as cheap as possible!
The table has already proven itself to work. An in depth explanation of the Modular Gaming Table series can be found on my personal blog.
The gallery section shows some pictures of the prototype table. These pictures were taken during the development and differ slightly from the actual table.
Please take a look at the instruction manual or videos to get a detailed description on how to setup a MGT.

<p>Ok, maybe it's not the most funded campaign in history :) Thanks to all our backers, your support means a lot to us! <br/></p>
<p>We released it as an <a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/436480"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Early Access package on Steam</a>, come and get it!<br/><br/>Welcome to the crowdfunding campaign for Soup: The Game! Soup is a 2D micro-strategy game for Windows, Mac and Linux. Soup is being developed by Dewdrop Games, a small team of independent developers. We are seeking your help to elevate the base concept of Soup to a whole new level, and turn it into a complete and awesome game.</p>

<p>Biologists, machines and programmers have been modelling biological systems for many years. We think that it’s about time a video-game got in on the act! This is our unique premise for Soup. We believe that battling agents, with limited interaction types, creates an experience that is bursting with colourful action, yet deceptively strategic.</p>
<p>We have endeavoured to combine two well-known game mechanics: the strategic building and commanding of units coupled with good old competitive battling! Player control input is purposefully limited but extremely tactical. You will need to keep a close eye on the evolving battlefield and make split-second decisions on which units to employ. These decisions can be the difference between triumphant victory and swift defeat. We have already amassed a community of fans who love sharing their strategies and techniques with us. In short, Soup is easy to pick-up-and-play but difficult to master.</p>
<span>At its core, Soup is a player-vs-AI or local multiplayer player-vs-player experience. We don’t plan to limit the fun to just two players simultaneously, however. Strategic microorganism chaos is best shared with others!  <br/><br/></span><p></p>

<p>The core team of Dewdrop Games recently participated in game development contest LudumDare #34. In just three days, we created from scratch a prototype for a video game that got loads of positive feedback and was simply great fun to play. The idea for Soup was born, but now we’re determined to realize its potential.</p>
<p>At present, we only work on Soup part-time. Actually, our paid jobs don't have to be boring, we know how to find fun stuff to do, but game development is the most absorbing and exciting job of all. With your support, we’ll be able to give it much more of our time and attention. There is so much that we want to add, including new artwork, additional species, more diverse unit behavior, catchy music tracks, and so on!</p>We have decided to set a modest target, which is just enough to cover what we consider to be Soup’s core features. We want to shoot for the stars, however, and have included many more ambitious features as our stretch goals, detailed below.<br/><br/><p></p>

<p>We don’t want to just settle with what we’ve outlined so far. We have loads of ideas for cool features that we’d like to add to Soup if we exceed our funding target. So without further ado, here is the list of our stretch goals:</p>

</div>","Soup: The Game is a micro-strategy experience in which you wage war against opposing microorganisms. It features minimalistic, intuitive controls and great depth of unit interaction.



Ok, maybe it's not the most funded campaign in history :) Thanks to all our backers, your support means a lot to us! 
We released it as an Early Access package on Steam, come and get it!Welcome to the crowdfunding campaign for Soup: The Game! Soup is a 2D micro-strategy game for Windows, Mac and Linux. Soup is being developed by Dewdrop Games, a small team of independent developers. We are seeking your help to elevate the base concept of Soup to a whole new level, and turn it into a complete and awesome game.



Biologists, machines and programmers have been modelling biological systems for many years. We think that it’s about time a video-game got in on the act! This is our unique premise for Soup. We believe that battling agents, with limited interaction types, creates an experience that is bursting with colourful action, yet deceptively strategic.
We have endeavoured to combine two well-known game mechanics: the strategic building and commanding of units coupled with good old competitive battling! Player control input is purposefully limited but extremely tactical. You will need to keep a close eye on the evolving battlefield and make split-second decisions on which units to employ. These decisions can be the difference between triumphant victory and swift defeat. We have already amassed a community of fans who love sharing their strategies and techniques with us. In short, Soup is easy to pick-up-and-play but difficult to master.
At its core, Soup is a player-vs-AI or local multiplayer player-vs-player experience. We don’t plan to limit the fun to just two players simultaneously, however. Strategic microorganism chaos is best shared with others!  


Different playable microorganism species constitute the “factions” or “races” in Soup: The Game. Each has its own unique appearance, special units and abilities to enjoy. The three core species are:


Bacteria - A form of life that is found in every habitat on Earth, bacteria is omnipresent and harks right back to the history of life itself. Farm to grow and then become the predator to hunt down those who dare to challenge that which is at the core of all life!




Virus - Much mystery surrounds these “organisms at the edge of life”. They have an unclear origin and are the providers of means of horizontal gene transfer for other lifeforms and powerful enemies. With the virus, you harvest and then seek to annihilate whatever opposes you with destructive mines and lethal nuke organisms.


Nanobots - Not all microorganisms are natural. Nanobots are the technology of the future gone rogue, and seek to destroy natural life! They are adept at ruthlessly and efficiently destroying their biological competition, with your instruction.  

The core team of Dewdrop Games recently participated in game development contest LudumDare #34. In just three days, we created from scratch a prototype for a video game that got loads of positive feedback and was simply great fun to play. The idea for Soup was born, but now we’re determined to realize its potential.
At present, we only work on Soup part-time. Actually, our paid jobs don't have to be boring, we know how to find fun stuff to do, but game development is the most absorbing and exciting job of all. With your support, we’ll be able to give it much more of our time and attention. There is so much that we want to add, including new artwork, additional species, more diverse unit behavior, catchy music tracks, and so on!We have decided to set a modest target, which is just enough to cover what we consider to be Soup’s core features. We want to shoot for the stars, however, and have included many more ambitious features as our stretch goals, detailed below.


We don’t want to just settle with what we’ve outlined so far. We have loads of ideas for cool features that we’d like to add to Soup if we exceed our funding target. So without further ado, here is the list of our stretch goals:

$3,000 - Campaigns

    
Although there will be plenty of strategic, battling action in the base game, we recognise that sometimes you just want to test yourself in a single-player campaign. The campaigns will feature a variety of different situations and progressive difficultly, going from levels where resources are plentiful and enemies scarce, to the ultimate challenge of wrestling control of every cubic micrometre of space from hostiles.

$5,000 - New species and extra music themes
   Soup will already feature three playable species and have a rollicking 
soundtrack of between three and five head-bobbing tunes, but we’d really
 like to be able to add more. If this stretch goal is met, we’ll add 
some brand new species, each with their own unique units and 
super-weapons, and also pledge to double the number of music tracks to 
accompany your battling.$7,000 - Online multiplayer
Local multiplayer is one of Soup’s features that we’re most excited 
about. We do recognise, however, that sometimes it’s just not possible 
to be sitting next to your mates when you eradicate their species! We 
would therefore love to reach this stretch goal to be able to develop an
 online multiplayer suite that will allow you to compete in tense 
battles with a handful of your friends at a time.$10,000 - Mobile platform supportIf we reach this stretch goal, we will port Soup over to mobile platforms, namely Android and iOS. We believe that Soup will be ideal on mobile with reworked touch controls, and will be a perfect fit for a quick battle whilst on-the-go. All existing backers would receive the app if this goal is met.$14,000 - Gamepad support


Our final stretch goal is ambitious, but one that we’d love to reach. Gamepad support would bring a whole new dimension of gameplay to Soup, giving greater freedom of movement and control precision. In addition to the minimalistic controls, gamepad support would allow control functions such as setting rally points and altering the behaviour of your units.$1 USDSpecial thanks!You have our eternal thanks.

<p></p>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span><p></p>
<p>To Triumph over the likes of werewolves, vampires, mummies, and worse, the Rippers must discover dark magics, collect powerful artifacts, and learn forbidden lore. Some even take the risk of implanting Rippertech: harvesting parts of the creatures they fight and grafting them onto their own bodies to harness the monstrous supernatural powers of their foes. </p>

To Triumph over the likes of werewolves, vampires, mummies, and worse, the Rippers must discover dark magics, collect powerful artifacts, and learn forbidden lore. Some even take the risk of implanting Rippertech: harvesting parts of the creatures they fight and grafting them onto their own bodies to harness the monstrous supernatural powers of their foes. 

Rippers: Rise of the Great One is a turn-based game for PC, Mac, and mobile devices, based on one of the most popular Savage Worlds roleplaying settings, Rippers. Players take the role of Victorian monster hunters, members of the shadowy secret society: the Rippers. 
In Rippers: Rise of the Great One players join the Rippers in a mysterious trek across the globe to far-flung locales, seeking clues to an ancient secret, and battling a host of powerful supernatural enemies.
Rippers: Rise of the Great One is an exciting tactical battle game using the Savage Worlds system. Combining an evil plot that threatens mankind and an ancient malevolent foe, the game presents players with unpredictable plot twists and cunning surprises right up to the last act of the game.


The game has been adapted from the Savage Worlds pen and paper system.  Players create and manage a group of Rippers in a struggle against evil and powerful monsters. The main focus is on the game turn-based tactical battles, but players must also protect and develop their Rippers' Lodge. This includes the construction of new facilities such as a library or laboratory, recruiting new Rippers, collecting revenue, and undertake combat missions to destroy the agents of the Cabal.
Just as with the pen and paper roleplaying game, Rippers: Rise of the Great One provides the player with a huge range of options for creating and customizing a heroic character. Players choose from a range of archetypes, which they can then customize with Edges and Hindrances, skills and attributes, to ensure that no two characters are quite alike.
Rippertech provides a further opportunity for developing a unique character. These implants and extracts are obtained by pseudo-science from a variety of supernatural creatures found in the game.



In addition to their main character, the player can recruit colleagues to their team of Rippers, equip them with arcane knowledge and gear, and add Rippertech implants to prepare them to fight the hideous beasts they must confront. With skill and planning, the player can select the most suitable band of Rippers and send them to complete specific tasks.
Arrayed against the Rippers are the forces of darkness. The many monsters opposing the hero and his companions ensure fights are exciting and varied, providing a wide choice of possible tactics. Each opponent has certain strengths and weaknesses, employs extensive use of their surroundings and unique abilities, and forces players to adapt to the conditions, making each battle unique.


Founded in February 2012, Krasnodymov Production LLC develops and publishes applications for mobile devices. Its titles include Confetti and the Tale Teller storytelling game.



We do believe that together we can create something unique, something that we couldn't make without your help. Every penny we will use to improve the art, style and animation of the game. Balancing game mechanics and developing the range of options the game deserves needs time and, with your help as supporters, together WE will create the game we all want to play.





Most of the money raised will go to towards animation. We want to create fully animated cut-scenes for the game, using classical 2D animation and this requires a lot of work. With all crazy stuff in our imaginations, this will add great immersion to the game and will require the talent of a special animator :)",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""font-size: 14px;"">Hi everyone, my name’s Lorenzo Marchetto, founder of Manorhouse Workshop, which deals with 28-35mm Wargames’ and modelism kit making since more than 13 years.</p>
<p>Our main activity is the production of buildings, sceneray elements, and modular gaming tables for tridimensional wargames and static modelism.</p>
<p>During our years of activity, we did work wiht a lot of national and international societies of this sector, providing them with dioramas, models, and other works. Those societies inclues <strong>Games Workshop</strong>, <strong>Rackham</strong>, <strong>Italeri</strong>, <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>, without forgetting editors’ houses like <strong>Hachette</strong> and <strong>Hobby&amp;Work</strong>, or TV channels like <strong>Disney Channel</strong> and <strong>RAI</strong>.</p>
<p>When working with privates collectionists or players, we did give birth to historical or fantasy’s reproductions, like Helm’s Deep of the Lord of the Rings, Falkenstein Castle in Corinthia or the Templar Castle of Almuruol in Portugal.</p>

<p>Our passion even made us create <strong>Mindstalkers</strong>, a 3D Skirmish Wargame in 35mm, which received a Nomination for the ""Best of Show"" at the prestigious Italian Fair of Lucca Games, finishing as 1<sup>st</sup> in 3D Wargames category.</p>
<p>Our experience, throughout the years allowed us to project and continuously build a range of modular scenary kits that can thus be combined to create multiple and infinite results, be it for outside or inside scopes, while having an extreme sturdiness yet keeping perfect realism, as you can see (<strong>to see hundreds of examples of our works, <a href=""http://manorhouseworkshopmindstalkers.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">come visit our Blog</a></strong>!).</p>

<h3>Project highlights</h3>
<p>Our vision is to design a new series of kits of 28-35mm scale, that will recreate a complete, typical italian medieval village, with its <strong>fortified walls</strong>, the <strong>manor</strong>, the <strong>church</strong>, the <strong>water mill</strong>, the center of the village with the <strong>Arengario</strong> and the <strong>houses</strong> which surround the central<strong> tournament square</strong>...</p>
<p>but also typical medieval stores, like the <strong>blacksmith</strong>, the <strong>shoe repairer</strong>, the <strong>butcher...</strong> and <em><strong>many more</strong></em>, which we will reveal progressively as the project unfolds!</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> At the moment we're making the first model (the Water Mill), and we have only hand drawings to let you see something as the one shown here below (<strong>you can see some more sketchesin the ""Gallery"" tab of this project</strong>). Once every master will be finished, we'll update the page with detailed photographs!</p>
<p><img alt=""Sample of concept sketches"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.alien.it/public/mhw-indie/project-sample.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Sample of concept sketches""/></p>
<hr/>
<p>This new series of kit, <strong>while increasing the modular possibilities</strong> of modelism and <strong>the level of details -</strong> and giving you a fresh new design - <strong>will be fully compatible with all of our existing products.</strong></p>
<p>This new series of kits will also be produced with an increased industrial policy: the material will be high quality polyreuthane resin, and the production will be done using the latest vacuum and printing technologies, with new generation silicons molds which highly lower down miscasts... and this will mean lower kit prices too!</p>
<p>This innovation will allows us to <strong>print the models both sides</strong>, while still keeping all doors and windows open to keep all gaming options open.<br/> </p>
<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>This Manorhouse Workshop project is very big and complex, and requires a hefty investment. Our decision to transition from an artisanal production to a new semi industrial one, and to direct client sales allows us to use the Indiegogo platform to its fullest, since it brings us into contact with you, our potential customers.</p>
<p>To bring it to life, <strong>we need you</strong>. We need your pledge so that we can have ""the numbers"" to lower production costs, and to gain better delivery costs for all. Indeed, you will be the one to decide if this project is worthy of success. And you will be the one to benefit from all the advantages, discounts and rewards.</p>
<p>By reaching our Indiegogo goal we will be able to start the production, and it will allow you to <strong>gain great gifts and rewards</strong>, while <strong>economizing on the final price</strong>... and if the project will rise and pass objectives and objectives, <strong>more and more prices and adds-on will be open</strong> to you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Available Perks"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.alien.it/public/mhw-indie/title-perks.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Perks!""/></p>
<h3>Perks Description</h3>
<p>Creating the Sales Bundles for our project turned out difficult. We did aim for the best, and so we did include a high number of buildings inside bigger perks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Indoegogo allows only up to 20 perks, but we do have dozens of different modular itens, and may different design for  some of them (e.g. houses' walls). </p>
<p><strong>So, all the goodies that we weren’t able to insert in the perks, will be proposed later on in some ADD-ONs</strong> that you will be able to purchase at a special Indiegogo price, merging them with the purchased perks.</p>
<p>Here beside you can see described all the perks; <strong>as soon as each product master will be ready we'll add here detailed photographs of it!</strong></p>
<h3>Technical Information</h3>
<ul>
<li>All kits are printed with high quality polyreuthane resin</li>
<li>All kits are printed (detailed) on both sides</li>
<li>All kits are sold unpainted, yet to be assembled.</li>
</ul>

</div></span></div>","Welcome to Manorhouse Workshop Indiegogo project!

 


Hi everyone, my name’s Lorenzo Marchetto, founder of Manorhouse Workshop, which deals with 28-35mm Wargames’ and modelism kit making since more than 13 years.
Our main activity is the production of buildings, sceneray elements, and modular gaming tables for tridimensional wargames and static modelism.
During our years of activity, we did work wiht a lot of national and international societies of this sector, providing them with dioramas, models, and other works. Those societies inclues Games Workshop, Rackham, Italeri, Wizards of the Coast, without forgetting editors’ houses like Hachette and Hobby&Work, or TV channels like Disney Channel and RAI.
When working with privates collectionists or players, we did give birth to historical or fantasy’s reproductions, like Helm’s Deep of the Lord of the Rings, Falkenstein Castle in Corinthia or the Templar Castle of Almuruol in Portugal.

Our passion even made us create Mindstalkers, a 3D Skirmish Wargame in 35mm, which received a Nomination for the ""Best of Show"" at the prestigious Italian Fair of Lucca Games, finishing as 1st in 3D Wargames category.
Our experience, throughout the years allowed us to project and continuously build a range of modular scenary kits that can thus be combined to create multiple and infinite results, be it for outside or inside scopes, while having an extreme sturdiness yet keeping perfect realism, as you can see (to see hundreds of examples of our works, come visit our Blog!).

It is our wish to keep bettering ourselves, by continue to create new products with new state of the art materials and priting techniques, like we’ve been constantly doing during our long history. 

Project highlights
Our vision is to design a new series of kits of 28-35mm scale, that will recreate a complete, typical italian medieval village, with its fortified walls, the manor, the church, the water mill, the center of the village with the Arengario and the houses which surround the central tournament square...
but also typical medieval stores, like the blacksmith, the shoe repairer, the butcher... and many more, which we will reveal progressively as the project unfolds!

NOTICE: At the moment we're making the first model (the Water Mill), and we have only hand drawings to let you see something as the one shown here below (you can see some more sketchesin the ""Gallery"" tab of this project). Once every master will be finished, we'll update the page with detailed photographs!


This new series of kit, while increasing the modular possibilities of modelism and the level of details - and giving you a fresh new design - will be fully compatible with all of our existing products.
This new series of kits will also be produced with an increased industrial policy: the material will be high quality polyreuthane resin, and the production will be done using the latest vacuum and printing technologies, with new generation silicons molds which highly lower down miscasts... and this will mean lower kit prices too!
This innovation will allows us to print the models both sides, while still keeping all doors and windows open to keep all gaming options open. 
Why Indiegogo?
This Manorhouse Workshop project is very big and complex, and requires a hefty investment. Our decision to transition from an artisanal production to a new semi industrial one, and to direct client sales allows us to use the Indiegogo platform to its fullest, since it brings us into contact with you, our potential customers.
To bring it to life, we need you. We need your pledge so that we can have ""the numbers"" to lower production costs, and to gain better delivery costs for all. Indeed, you will be the one to decide if this project is worthy of success. And you will be the one to benefit from all the advantages, discounts and rewards.
By reaching our Indiegogo goal we will be able to start the production, and it will allow you to gain great gifts and rewards, while economizing on the final price... and if the project will rise and pass objectives and objectives, more and more prices and adds-on will be open to you!
 

Perks Description
Creating the Sales Bundles for our project turned out difficult. We did aim for the best, and so we did include a high number of buildings inside bigger perks.
Unfortunately, Indoegogo allows only up to 20 perks, but we do have dozens of different modular itens, and may different design for  some of them (e.g. houses' walls). 
So, all the goodies that we weren’t able to insert in the perks, will be proposed later on in some ADD-ONs that you will be able to purchase at a special Indiegogo price, merging them with the purchased perks.
Here beside you can see described all the perks; as soon as each product master will be ready we'll add here detailed photographs of it!
Technical Information

All kits are printed with high quality polyreuthane resin
All kits are printed (detailed) on both sides
All kits are sold unpainted, yet to be assembled.

Let’s get into 2 very interesting Perks. (Models pictured are the basics of space for the creation of masters)
House Raisers Pack 1 - 85,00 Euro
House Raisers Pack 2 - 140,00 Euro
Those are without doubt the most useful and convenient perks to rapidly build a little village.
Their content will allow you to combine in a multitude of ways the house kits.


As you can see from the above pictures, with a Perk from 85,00 Euro  and a one from 140,00 Euro  you can create a small village in various ways, the combinations are endless.
Now let’s see how you can easily compose the various modules to obtain a group of houses attached one to another, in the typical italian fashion.


Every storey will have an access to the upper and to the lower floor.

With the purchase of those 2 perks you will also get the rewards 01 serie, which will give you even more possibilities of combination.

The rewards 01 serie was created precisely to be combined with those 2 perks.
Each added purchase of those 2 perks will get you the possibility to get an additiona rewards 01 serie.
Or, if you prefer, you can get your rewards based on the overall amount of goods purchased, as usual.

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Vietnam is a collector NAC based wargame, set in this bloody conflict. It recreates the battles and challenges that came under american detachments.

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Two, three or four players take command of American and South Vietnamese troops, and the army of North Vietnam.<br/> Once initial troops placed on the board, each player takes turns moving the mobility factor of each unit, applying modifiers depending on the passing zone (rivers, streams, jungle paths, roads and rice fields).<br/> Infantry units can engage in combat with adjacent opponents, existing differences between combat values depending on their experience and equipment (guerrillas, viet cong, infantry and Green Berets are an example).<br/> Artillery units can launch ranged attacks against other tabs or objectives.<br/> The weather factor also plays a big role.<br/> The firepower and mobility offered by different types of helicopters are the great strength of the American contingent, as opposed to the number of North Vietnamese infantry and difficult terrain mobility, may be grouped, giving the oportunity to cheating with empty groups that must be discovered approaching them.<br/> Several Fire Support Base, which at siege are recreated in an extended area on the board, providing another level, much more exciting, including mines and barbed wire to open a gap.<br/> At the end of the round 14, players earn points for every target that their units still maintain (bases, hills and villages).

Vietnam is a collector NAC based wargame, set in this bloody conflict. It recreates the battles and challenges that came under american detachments. The huge amount of tokens shows the different units and weaponry used: Viet Cong, Green Beret, heliborne troops, infantry, mortars, anti-aircraft, missile launchers, Chinook, Cobra, Huey and Cayuse helicopters.
Two, three or four players take command of American and South Vietnamese troops, and the army of North Vietnam. Once initial troops placed on the board, each player takes turns moving the mobility factor of each unit, applying modifiers depending on the passing zone (rivers, streams, jungle paths, roads and rice fields). Infantry units can engage in combat with adjacent opponents, existing differences between combat values depending on their experience and equipment (guerrillas, viet cong, infantry and Green Berets are an example). Artillery units can launch ranged attacks against other tabs or objectives. The weather factor also plays a big role. The firepower and mobility offered by different types of helicopters are the great strength of the American contingent, as opposed to the number of North Vietnamese infantry and difficult terrain mobility, may be grouped, giving the oportunity to cheating with empty groups that must be discovered approaching them. Several Fire Support Base, which at siege are recreated in an extended area on the board, providing another level, much more exciting, including mines and barbed wire to open a gap. At the end of the round 14, players earn points for every target that their units still maintain (bases, hills and villages). The winner is the most points of victory has joined.
Contents:

1 80x64cm game board depicting in detail villages of Vietnam jungle
1 Fully color illustrated manual
360 High detail tokens, depicting different infantry, artillery and aircraft units involved in the conflict
2 control sheets to create groups
1 Reference Tables Sheet
1 Wargame special Dice
Vietnam. El Wargame.
Vietnam es un wargame de coleccionista ambientado en el conflicto que le da nombre. En él se recrean los combates y dificultades a las que se vieron sometidos los destacamentos estadounidenses. La enorme cantidad de fichas reflejan las diferente unidades y maquinaria usada: viet cong, boinas verdes, tropa helitransportada, infantería, morteros, antiaéreos, lanzamisiles, helicopteros Chinook, Cobra, Cayuse y Huey.Dos, tres o cuatro jugadores toman el mando de las tropas americanas y survietnamitas, o el ejercito de Vietnam del norte.Una vez colocadas las tropas iniciales sobre el tablero, cada jugador se turna moviendo el factor de movimiento de cada ficha, aplicando modificadores dependiendo del tipo de zona por el que pase (ríos, riachuelos, jungla, caminos, rutas y arrozales).Las unidades de infantería pueden entablar combate con los adversarios adyacentes, existiendo diferencias entre los valores de combate dependiendo de su experiencia y equipo (guerrilleros, viet cong, infantería y boinas verdes son un ejemplo).Las unidades de artillería pueden lanzar ataques a distancia contra otras fichas u objetivos.El factor climatológico también juega un gran papel.La capacidad de fuego y movilidad que ofrecen los distintos tipos de helicópteros son la gran baza del contingente americano, en oposición a la cantidad de infantería norvietnamita y su movilidad por terreno dificultoso,pudiendo agruparse, engañando al contrario con grupos vacíos que avanzan y deben ser descubiertos acercándose a ellos.Existen varias Base de Apoyo al Fuego, que al asaltarse se recrean en una zona ampliada en el tablero, ofreciendo otra escala, mucho más emocionante, incluyendo minas y alambradas por las que debe abrirse una brecha.Al finalizar el turno 14, los jugadores suman puntos por cada objetivo en el que aún mantengan sus unidades (bases, colinas y poblados). El ganador es el que mayor cantidad de puntos de victoria haya sumado. El tablero ricamente ilustrado mide 80x64 cm,  dividido en hexágonos, que representa las junglas, BAF, poblados y arrozales de Vietnam.  Con 360 fichas de 1 cm. ilustradas que representan unidades tales como: viet cong, tropas helitransportadas, artilleria, cañones, morteros, helicopteros cayuse, chinook, cobra y huey (entre otros). Además incluye 2 hojas de control para los objetivos y agrupaciones, así como una hoja de tabla de referencias.
Contenido de la caja:

1 Tablero de juego de 80x64 que representa con todo detalle y arte la jungla y poblados de Vietnam
1 Manual a todo color ricamente ilustrado
360 Fichas troqueladas de alto detalle, representando las distintas unidades de infantería, artillería y aviación que participaron en el conflicto
2 Hojas de control para crear guarniciones y agrupaciones

“Under that Rain” is an old school adventure psychological horror game in pixel art .In a rain that never stops, a man faces an endless nightmare. 

Story

It was nightfall and  Andrè Lacroix, a social worker from Paris, opened the last folder of the day. Outside, it was starting to rain. He read the name on the top of the dossier “Adrien Luis Lazarius”, an orphan given in custody to his aunt who lives in a manor house outside the town. Suspected child abuse, reported the file.

The child was missing and the people at the manor house were acting as if they had something to hide.
So began Andrè’s  journey into the horrible facts surrounding that house. He will be overwhelmed by a strange kind of nostalgia mixed with a horrible form of oppression. This will lead our hero to find answers. Soon he will learn that nothing is as it seems and that sometimes the worst atrocities could be made even worse.

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are focused on understanding the interaction of people and the devices encountered daily.

</div></div>","Meet Atom, the world's smallest smartcard




Atom is an elegant smartcard made of high grade polished polycarbonate that can replace any of your existing ones. Wear it however it matters to you.



Small Product, Big Idea
Atom is tiny, so your smartcard need not belong in your wallet. It can be worn or attached on just about everything. 



Clip it on your briefcase, purse, sports band, or just a casual accessory. Atom seamlessly adapts to whatever the occasion. 

Break the Mold, Take Control
Atom is compliant with most existing infrastructure, yet personalized. When you use Atom, you are not just someone in the crowd. You are you.




Be creative with basic means of attachment, like tapes, straps or clips. Or you can even design your own wearable accessories for Atom. 
Create a Design, Drive a Community

3D printing marketplace and services are increasingly popular. Print your design for personal use, or sell it to others. Share and browse assorted designs.  Atom allows you to connect with a larger community.

The Atom Team
We are focused on understanding the interaction of people and the devices encountered daily. We aim to generate discussions for the role of technology in our lives. We believe that technological products should not control our lifestyle. Instead, we should decide how they can be compatible to our own individual lifestyle. At the same time, we want to make the discussions a reality by developing great products that really allow people to be in control of technology. Atom is the first of such products we design.
Our Story

Fed up with the countless times we have missed trains because we had to burrow through our bags for our wallets, we happen to discuss such inconveniences over lunch one day. We observed that many people have multiple cards in the wallet that cause errors when tapped on readers. We also notice that because of this, people also often separate the cards by taking one or two out of the wallet. This leads to people misplacing those cards. 
So we asked ourselves, ""Why do chips that handle contactless payment (and other authentication processes) have to come embedded with cards? "" We then worked on a design to replace existing smartcards with something that can be attached with anything you always have by your side. 



Atom is small and versatile, so you can attach it to the most important things in your life, while solving all the problems faced by traditional smartcards. We hope that through Atom, there will be greater awareness in rethinking the usage of the devices we use daily. 

The Atom Journey




Design Motivation
We thought of the name 'Atom' because of the simplicity it represents. We want to create a product that strips the conventional smartcard to its essence, and yet just as functional. 

We also asked ourselves, ‘Why hold your card when you can wear it?’ Intrigued by the possibility of technology infused fashion, we are inspired to kick things off with a clip because it is generic and multi-functional. 

The possibilities are endless; it is up to your imagination to build up the usage for Atom.  



Functional Prototype
In order to make Atom small, we redesigned the antenna found in a conventional smartcard. We also optimized the antenna to authenticate at the NFC frequency of 13.56 MHz. We have patented the antenna design and it is currently being tested in a few organizations around America and Asia.

Chip
The chip within your smartcard can be easily removed and inserted into Atom by:


Shining your mobile flashlight through the smartcard and mark out where the chip lies
Cutting out the portion of the card that holds the chip
Placing this portion into the solution that we provided
Removing the chip after 3 hours and slotting it into Atom

Use of Funds
We have refined our prototypes and can start production at any time. We have optimized our supply chain. Now, we are looking for funds to enter the production stage. These are the major channels of where the funds raised will flow:


Production tooling for various intricate components that allow Atom to be so small and sleek.

Risks & Challenges




The specially designed antenna in Atom have been tested with most protocols. However, there is no standardization of quality in smartcard readers, especially for access control. Should you find something that doesn't work, please feedback to us. 
The process of removing the chip from your smartcard is irreversible. Ensure that Atomizing that particular smartcard is what you want. 
There are inherent production risks with any new product. However, we have already sourced for multiple providers and manufacturers for each different component in Atom.

<div>I gather these sources to get the game done and to support me during development. the programming of The Legend Of Zahira and the level design is done by one person ""Fabio Fortino"" while the artwork of the covers is done by ""Fabio Carretti"". The game will include 10 levels full of action and combat. I care about this project because I think it is treated in detail and artistically, its pixelart style is very reminiscent of 90s games. The goal is to create a fun and solid game in gameplay and combat system. The artificial intelligence of the enemies is effective and well made, I studied in great detail how the enemies had to behave to make the experience satisfying and beautiful to see. <strong>The Legend Of Zahira will be released on Steam,ps4,xbox one and nintendo switch once the goal is reached.</strong>

I immediately fell in love with the world of video games, with the passage of time other computers arrived I passed from the amiga to the PC, where I spent many hours in the company of video games. In 2008 I began to think that I wanted to learn how to create videogames, after a few weeks I began to read up on development kits and immediately began to study. After 4 years of study I started creating small games for third party companies with very small earnings. <strong>Now here I am on Indiegogo with a project of my own</strong>.

<h3>What is The Academy Boardgame?</h3>
<p>The Academy is a board game created by a police officer and two dispatchers. In the game, players are recruits in the police academy and the goal of the game is to complete the seven required classes and be the first player to reach graduation. Sounds easy enough. <br/><br/>The challenge of the game comes with forcing players to reach each class in the order that they are drawn at the beginning of each game. Once a player has reached the next class on their list, they either pass or fail, based on rolling the die. If they fail, they must report to ""PT"" (Physical Training) and return to that class to try again.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.theacademyboardgame.com/resources/_wsb_495x495_board+for+web.JPG"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Academy Board""/><br/><br/>Along the way, players will encounter the dreaded academy counselors. These counselors could help you, or hurt you, depending on how far along the game is, and what classes you have left to complete. For instance, you might draw a card that sends you to the class, ""Firearms."" This would be helpful, as you could potentially complete this class out of order and give you an advantage, however, on the flip side, if you have already completed Firearms training, this could send you out of the way of your next class, costing you time.</p>

<p>As the game may appeal to those involved in the law enforcement community, this game requires absolutely no police background and is fun for the whole family. The recommended players are from 2-6 and ages 12 and up. The full game includes, The Academy game board, 6 player pieces, deck of classes (7 cards), deck of counselor says (24 cards), and 1 die.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
We have already produced a professional prototype of the game as you can from our photos, but we need more money to mass produce the game to make it cheap enough for consumers to want to buy it. With a goal of $15,000 (We know that sounds like a lot!) we will be able to produce a higher number of games to lower the production costs and even be able to ship the games to you right to your door for only $20! It will not be easy to raise the required funds for us to be successful in producing our game for purchase, but with your help we can do it!</div>
<div>
<h3>Why Support This Particular Game?</h3>
<p>Our goal was to make a fun game for everybody. Since we all three work in law enforcement, we decided to create a game around that theme. There are a handful of police oriented games out nowadays, but some are very difficult to follow, to learn, and take too long. This game is engaging, addictive, and as soon as one game is over, players want to start a new game over again! Help us share this game with the world! For only $20, you can help us out greatly, and have a great game from its first print run mailed directly to you, now thats a heck of a deal!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you aren't interested in supporting our campaign by purchasing a game, we can still use all of the help we can get. A simple share on facebook or twitter will go a long way in aiding this campaign. If you do decide to purchase a game, we still need lots of exposure to raise enough money to get our game produced!</p>

<div>
<b></b><p></p>
<p>We are a group of
professionals from the world of digital media who share a dream together:
to drive the game in general and enigmatography, within the social logic,
typical of  Web 2.0. The project aims to have
each game become a real cornerstone of socialization with the help of its rules
and dynamics.</p>
<p>The goal of this
campaign is to raise  $ 47,000 – none of
this money will go to us; it will all go into the game production. We love working
with a small budget and it makes us elated, but we had to stretch it as far as
we could. If this game is taken seriously it will need to look nice in every
detail.  This is what will make the
difference between a homemade game and a game created by a professionals’ team.</p>
<p>If you’ve decided
to help, you can contribute by whatever you choose in exchange for rewards
-  take a look at the column on the right
to see what’s available. The more you pledge, the better the rewards and the
closer we are to producing this game. </p>
<p>If we hit our
target by the deadline, your credit card will be charged – nothing will be
taken until then. If we don’t meet our target, you won’t be charged for anything,
but, on the other hand, the world will never know about all these inherent
possibilities of playing Sudoku. </p>
<p>Please, also share
our campaign with your colleagues, family and friends - anyone who you think
might be interested in playing this game. Getting the word out is impossible without
your help. </p>
<p>Check out our
website and follow us on facebook and twitter where you will find all the latest
news of our progress.</p>

Sudoku?</b><br/>
</li></ul></h3>
<p>Sudoku was born in
the XVIII century and the modern Sudoku, the current version, was first
published in 1979.</p>
<p>Starting from 2005,
it has gained a great media attention. It has become one of the most famous
puzzles in a few years and this makes its own rules universally recognized. In
addition, its numerical nature clears the problems related to language barriers.
</p>
<p>In recent times
there have been numerous digital versions of Sudoku, but they have always been
mere transpositions of the paper version, until today...</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><ul><li>
<b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Why
did Brain-e choose crowdfunding? And Indiegogo?</b><br/>
</li></ul></h3>
<p>We believe the
risks involved with bringing Sudoku War to market are minimal at this stage:</p>
<p>First, we are
highly experienced in game design and programming.</p>
<p>Secondly, Brain-e
is already quite far along in the production process. In fact, the whole
process of analysis has been done, as well as the study on suggestion and the
dynamics of the championships.</p>
<p>However, we are lucky
to work closely with industry leading partners.</p>
<p>We have extensive
experience with logistics and shipping issues dealing with both domestic and
international orders. We do not see fulfillment as a major risk in this
project.</p>
<p>Depending on the
offers, we forecast  Sudoku Wars shipping
start in February and we are excited to offer our loyal backers the first Sudoku

New Features, New levels, 
and World Leagues !
FIND BELOW THE ""SPREAD THE WORD"" COMPETITION






This is
the classic Sudoku, only better.

Discover
the intuitive graphic interface and challenge yourself on new patterns and at different
levels of difficulty.
Train
yourself to become the best, compare your performance through the Sudoku Analytics
(number of games played,  average  errors per game, average of
correct entries per game, mean time to resolution, personal records ...).
When you are ready, start playing Sudoku Wars




Challange your friends on the
same game plan, whenever you want. You have limited time available... it’ll win the one who saves the longest time.

Every mistake you make, will
make you waste time. If the both of you complete the game plan, it’ll win the
one who spends the shortest time. If time expires before completion, it’ll win the
player who places the biggest amount of correct numbers in the diagram.
Each challenge has some points
up for grabs. The more the victory is crushing the more points you'll get.
The multi player mode Sudoku
wars keeps you constantly updated on your level of play and on the level of
your opponents, in order to always keep challenges exciting and balanced.
Depending on the level of your
opponent, the points at stake increase or diminish.
Link your game account to the
various social profiles, share your progress with your friends and challenge them
to a thrilling head-to-head!


Play and use these features:  suggestion, error checking and smart grid. We
are planning to introduce other features. Of course, you can' t use them at any
time you want in the Challenge Mode. In case you use a feature, the algorithm
we studied, will introduce a penalty that is going to affect  your final score. It's up to you to decide if,
when and how often to use them.









Championships

Yes! You read that
right! we are going to organize special tournaments of Sudoku! At stake there
is the honor and not only...matches will be played on knockout stage and will
be organized in groups. You will get awards, you will climb the charts.


Levels


You are going to start from
a low level. The more victories you gain, the more heroic  opponents you
destroy and the bigger will your Sudoku Analytics be. This will allow you to
climb levels and charts.

Our Mission





About Us



We are a group of
professionals from the world of digital media who share a dream together:
to drive the game in general and enigmatography, within the social logic,
typical of  Web 2.0. The project aims to have
each game become a real cornerstone of socialization with the help of its rules
and dynamics.
The goal of this
campaign is to raise  $ 47,000 – none of
this money will go to us; it will all go into the game production. We love working
with a small budget and it makes us elated, but we had to stretch it as far as
we could. If this game is taken seriously it will need to look nice in every
detail.  This is what will make the
difference between a homemade game and a game created by a professionals’ team.
If you’ve decided
to help, you can contribute by whatever you choose in exchange for rewards
-  take a look at the column on the right
to see what’s available. The more you pledge, the better the rewards and the
closer we are to producing this game. 
If we hit our
target by the deadline, your credit card will be charged – nothing will be
taken until then. If we don’t meet our target, you won’t be charged for anything,
but, on the other hand, the world will never know about all these inherent
possibilities of playing Sudoku. 
Please, also share
our campaign with your colleagues, family and friends - anyone who you think
might be interested in playing this game. Getting the word out is impossible without
your help. 
Check out our
website and follow us on facebook and twitter where you will find all the latest
news of our progress.


Here we are!










Why
Sudoku?

Sudoku was born in
the XVIII century and the modern Sudoku, the current version, was first
published in 1979.
Starting from 2005,
it has gained a great media attention. It has become one of the most famous
puzzles in a few years and this makes its own rules universally recognized. In
addition, its numerical nature clears the problems related to language barriers.

In recent times
there have been numerous digital versions of Sudoku, but they have always been
mere transpositions of the paper version, until today...


Why
did Brain-e choose crowdfunding? And Indiegogo?

We believe the
risks involved with bringing Sudoku War to market are minimal at this stage:
First, we are
highly experienced in game design and programming.
Secondly, Brain-e
is already quite far along in the production process. In fact, the whole
process of analysis has been done, as well as the study on suggestion and the
dynamics of the championships.
However, we are lucky
to work closely with industry leading partners.
We have extensive
experience with logistics and shipping issues dealing with both domestic and
international orders. We do not see fulfillment as a major risk in this
project.
Depending on the
offers, we forecast  Sudoku Wars shipping
start in February and we are excited to offer our loyal backers the first Sudoku
Wars, born from these efforts!

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We need $1,500 to secure the date at the Prescott Resort &amp; Convention Center. The 4% Indegogo has been included to meet our goal.

<h3>The Impact</h3>Prescott is a vibrant community and nearly everything is available here... except a gaming convention. Launching Polyhedracon will bring revenue and reputation to the city and notoriety as the home of a quality convention.<br/><br/>I've been gaming since 1973, roleplaying since 1981and have traveled the country attending conventions and have had the good fortune to play with the master, E.

<p>I'm hdk from serious lemon, designer of Realm - Fantasy Warfare.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>serious lemon are a new games company, based in Melbourne, Australia. Realm is our first game (hopefully of many) and the result of many, many hours of work (Really, it's just playing toy soldiers though).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We're inviting everyone who is interested in tabletop gaming to have a look at what we have to offer and to hopefully pitch in with your support to help us develop this game to its potential.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Anyone who would like to know more should head to <a href=""http://www.realmfw.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.realmfw.com</a> where you can read the entire rules of the game and all there is to know about it. To unlock the Armies of Realm section, please enter the key:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>indiegogo</p>
<p> </p>
<p>into the box at the top of the site and click 'submit'. This is a temporary key which will expire once this campaign ends.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why Realm?</h2>
<p>Realm was designed from the bottom up with freedom in mind.<br/><br/>Freedom is inherent two-fold:<br/><br/>The first is, we offer the rules to you in a 'pay what you like' model. This gives you the freedom to support the game however you wish.<br/><br/>Secondly, the rules themselves are designed to be open and non-restrictive. Army creation can be seen as a somewhat modular process. Each army has access to the same equipment, the same monsters and the same worldly treasures ensuring quite limitless combinations.<br/><br/>Even the armies themselves can be mixed through the use of the rules for Mercenaries. Here's your chance to see your Giants and Halflings in action alongside each other. Or a powerful, but malicious Human Necromancer raising an undead host.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The rules themselves are simple and intuitive. The mechanics follow a 'set and go' turn-based process where at the start of a player's turn, they declare all of the orders for each unit that turn. The results of these orders are then played out over the course of the turn.<br/><br/>In Realm we use a D10 system for any characteristic checking. The results are therefor instantly known to both players without the need to lookup any tables. Not that we've done away with tables, they're just reserved for when we need to generate unique or random results.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What's on offer?</h2>
<p>In line with our 'pay what you like' policy, everyone who pitches in at least $1 will receive a key for a 1 year subscription to the game. All contributors will also be acknowledged in a 'thank you' page on realmfw.com.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following the indiegogo campaign, Realm will enter a public beta phase for two months, open only to the indeigogo backers. Anyone with early access to the beta will get their key directly after this campaign ends. Late access beta keys will be supplied after the first month has passed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following this two month period (slightly more, scheduled for July 1st), Realm will be released openly to the public.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Funding Goals?</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>$2000</h3>
<p>At $2000 we will ink out art for the majority of the units in the game.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>$5000</h3>
<p>At $5000 we will not only have enough to fully flesh out the rules and artwork, but we will also begin work on producing the first models in a miniature range to complement the setting.</p></div>","Welcome!

Why Realm?
Realm was designed from the bottom up with freedom in mind.Freedom is inherent two-fold:The first is, we offer the rules to you in a 'pay what you like' model. This gives you the freedom to support the game however you wish.Secondly, the rules themselves are designed to be open and non-restrictive. Army creation can be seen as a somewhat modular process. Each army has access to the same equipment, the same monsters and the same worldly treasures ensuring quite limitless combinations.Even the armies themselves can be mixed through the use of the rules for Mercenaries. Here's your chance to see your Giants and Halflings in action alongside each other. Or a powerful, but malicious Human Necromancer raising an undead host.The rules themselves are simple and intuitive. The mechanics follow a 'set and go' turn-based process where at the start of a player's turn, they declare all of the orders for each unit that turn. The results of these orders are then played out over the course of the turn.In Realm we use a D10 system for any characteristic checking. The results are therefor instantly known to both players without the need to lookup any tables. Not that we've done away with tables, they're just reserved for when we need to generate unique or random results.
 
What's on offer?
In line with our 'pay what you like' policy, everyone who pitches in at least $1 will receive a key for a 1 year subscription to the game. All contributors will also be acknowledged in a 'thank you' page on realmfw.com.
 
Following the indiegogo campaign, Realm will enter a public beta phase for two months, open only to the indeigogo backers. Anyone with early access to the beta will get their key directly after this campaign ends. Late access beta keys will be supplied after the first month has passed.
 
Following this two month period (slightly more, scheduled for July 1st), Realm will be released openly to the public.
 
Funding Goals?
 
$2000
At $2000 we will ink out art for the majority of the units in the game.
 
$5000
At $5000 we will not only have enough to fully flesh out the rules and artwork, but we will also begin work on producing the first models in a miniature range to complement the setting.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our basic estimations of the project are much more than the basic amount of the campaign.We have already spent on the project from our own savings an amount close to that of the primary campaign’s amount. So our first goal is to reach the primary goal of the campaign so that we can continue the process of developing the game on the same plan of development. Also, there are other stretch goals explained in the theme of the campaign that aims to add other improvements to the game and make it more fun.<br/>In case we exceed the basic amount of the project, the excess will be added to each of the stretch goals by certain amounts that allow us to finish each stretch goal reached.</p><p> </p><p><strong>When will the game be released?</strong></p><p>Expect to be released during Q2 of 2018.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Does the game support gamepad(joystick)?</strong></p><p>Of course, the game supports the Xbox Controller.</p><p> </p><p><strong>I’m a YouTuber or a Game Streamer.

During this period, the number of infected people increased significantly and the situation became impossible to control. Fearing its spread to neighbouring cities, the central government decided to send in large military teams to eliminate all civilians within the city including civilians which have not shown infection symptoms yet, for fear that they might be carrying the virus inside.So Adam, his daughter Lisa and their friend Frank decide to leave the city as soon as possible after this decision. It takes about 72 hours to get out of the city. the game was chosen as one of the best games that participated in a joint competition held by Manga Productions (@manga_prd ) and Square Enix (@SquareEnix ).  Screenshots    1-Story mode: - three people are trying to escape from their city, in which an unknown virus has spread and led to the transformation of most civilians to the zombies.  So the government decided to send in special teams to eliminate the zombies within 72 hours before the virus spreads to other neighbouring cities. 2-Survival mode:-  Must Survive against endless waves of attacking zombies.Earning points from killing zombies, These points can be used to purchase weapons.-There is no limit to the number of rounds.-The game will end when the player has been incapacitated or killed by the Zombies.-Zombies will drop power-ups such as Max Ammo, Nuke, or Freeze Time, making the round easier.-The zombies' health grows rapidly, with each round.  The Last 72 Hour is being developed for the PC with gamepad support and will be made available through Steam and also for Xbox One If we reach the required amount in the campaign.Other platforms, like Mac, Linux, and PS4  are considered but are not a high priority. Try it now on gamejolt!  The demo version does not contain all features of the game, many features will be added during the next development stage.                AI for the soldiersHearing system:- Depends on the sound of shooting close to the enemy, as well as when the reload of weapons is done near the enemy.Visibility:- Depends on the angles of the vision and the distance between the enemy and the player, as well as hiding behind the barriers leads to blocking the vision of the enemy.Hiding behind barriers:- One of the features of the AI of the soldiers is hiding behind the barriers to avoid firing shots between him and the player.Exploration and research:- Soldiers search for you and your friends if one of the members of the squad is killed. AI for the zombiesHearing system:- Depends on the sound of shooting close to the enemy, as well as when the reload of weapons is done near the enemy.Visibility:- Depends on the angles of the vision and the distance between the enemy and the player, as well as hiding behind the barriers leads to blocking the vision of the enemy.  *  Hunt the animals and get their meat to survive during the escape, you must roast the meat after hunting to be able to use it.* Look for different foods such as canapes, bread and other foods to keep your hunger energy.* You can get drinking water through water bottles as well as through the wells in the farms to keep your thirst energy.    You find a menu in the game enables you to preview the weapons and modify them from the addition of pieces like a laser, silencer or remove them as you want.    We've introduced stretch goals in advance so you can see what to expect should we exceed our goal.  Features:-
Helping the player to kill zombies and soldiers in the story mode.
Full control of the character to perform multiple tasks such as entering places where the player can not reach.
Adding 30 different animations to the character.
You can buy the character in the survival mode to help you kill the zombies.
Adding the character to the co-op mode in case we reach the goal.
  Features:-You must survive as much as possible and protect The wounded soldiers from your squad.
Endless waves of attacking zombies.
Endless waves of attacking Nazi soldiers.
Add weapons used during the World war II.
Add new maps from WW II.
Purchase weapons through points collected during play.
  The game will be launched on the Xbox One If we reach $ 9000. features:-
Play with your friends against the endless waves of the zombies.
Add new four maps.
you can choose many characters.
The amount required to add this mode to the game is $ 14,000        The budget  Challenges and risksThe game has gone through advanced stages of development, so the risk in the game itself is minor, but the greater risk is not reaching our main goal in the campaign. In this case, the game will not be in the way we expect.  We worked during the last period on the development of the game without salaries for more than a year, during which we spent an amount of money on the development process close to the main objective of this campaign.  Therefore, your support is very important for us to progress rapidly in its development. And here is what you can do to minimize the risk:

  FAQWill you make a version for PS4 & Linux? If we get to the main goals of the project it is possible to release the game on MAC or PlayStation platforms, but now they are not the priority. Is there a CD/DVD/BLURAY copy can we buy it ??with the size of our current team, we want to focus on developing the game more and not on other things that may harm the development process. Isn’t the amount required in the campaign very small compared to the game you are working on?It is true that the amount is very small compared to the size of the current project. Our basic estimations of the project are much more than the basic amount of the campaign.We have already spent on the project from our own savings an amount close to that of the primary campaign’s amount. So our first goal is to reach the primary goal of the campaign so that we can continue the process of developing the game on the same plan of development. Also, there are other stretch goals explained in the theme of the campaign that aims to add other improvements to the game and make it more fun.In case we exceed the basic amount of the project, the excess will be added to each of the stretch goals by certain amounts that allow us to finish each stretch goal reached. When will the game be released?Expect to be released during Q2 of 2018. Does the game support gamepad(joystick)?Of course, the game supports the Xbox Controller. I’m a YouTuber or a Game Streamer.

We believe our <b>Alice Of Wonderland Trading Card Game </b>will do just that!</p><p>Our game consists of characters based on a Steampunk Wonderland world, and also includes other fairy tale characters in the public domain that have been re-imagined. The trading card game for this project consists of 2 kingdom ""core"" decks, <b>The Kingdom of Hearts</b>, and <b>The Kingdom of Roses.</b> Both of these kingdom decks are included in the minimum funding goal needed to be printed. Once this goal is reached, we can aim for the stretch goals that will open up more goods that will make the game a more interesting and rewarding experience.</p><p><br/></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/327607/files/20140124112603-Indiegogo_Header_WhoWeAre.jpg?1390591563"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We are a graphic design firm consisting of 2 art and design studios, <b>Sketch2Draw</b> and <b>FotogSyn</b>, based out of Virginia.

FotogSyn has a background in the comic book illustration, character design, story creation, graphics, inking, marketing and product placement, and offers time-released limited edition prints available at comic book conventions and through their website, fotogsyn.com. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/327990/files/20140124152546-Indiegogo_Header_TheDetails.jpg?1390605946"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h3></h3><p></p><p>We need your support to fund and make this game a reality.

<p></p></div>","We have created the Alice Of Wonderland Trading Card Game with easy and simple game rules for all age levels to be able to play. We know there are a lot of other trading card games out there, but we wanted to come up with a game that everyone will recognize, and also be easy to play right out of the box. We believe our Alice Of Wonderland Trading Card Game will do just that!Our game consists of characters based on a Steampunk Wonderland world, and also includes other fairy tale characters in the public domain that have been re-imagined. The trading card game for this project consists of 2 kingdom ""core"" decks, The Kingdom of Hearts, and The Kingdom of Roses. Both of these kingdom decks are included in the minimum funding goal needed to be printed. Once this goal is reached, we can aim for the stretch goals that will open up more goods that will make the game a more interesting and rewarding experience.We are a graphic design firm consisting of 2 art and design studios, Sketch2Draw and FotogSyn, based out of Virginia. Our background consists of illustration, comic books, game design, commercial graphic design, event planning, branding, and entertainment production.Sketch2Draw is responsible for a lot of the cool art you see in the cards, and is constantly busy creating new artwork for the game. Sketch2Draw has been designing character concepts in the comic book and fantasy genre for over 20 years, and has now just teamed up with FotogSyn to create this new trading card game. Sketh2Draw also creates video tutorials on Youtube, and operates sketch2draw.com.FotogSyn is a graphic design studio (also helping in a lot of the cool art you'll be seeing in Alice of Wonderland). They deal in exclusive prints in a very limited quantity. Their focus is more on the quality and collectibility of items and merchandise, instead of just over saturating the market. FotogSyn has a background in the comic book illustration, character design, story creation, graphics, inking, marketing and product placement, and offers time-released limited edition prints available at comic book conventions and through their website, fotogsyn.com. We need your support to fund and make this game a reality. The funding for this trading card game will help with distribution and production of the game. The more it gets funded, the more things we will be able to produce!
We need to raise $4,000 to start. This will help create both the Kingdom of Hearts and the Kingdom of Roses core decks.
Our stretch goals start at $50,000 which we will release foil trading cards.
We will release exclusive rarity cards only at Wizard World St. Louis in April. More exclusive limited edition cards will be released at future Wizard World Comic Cons during the year.
We are offering limited 11x17 prints along with certain tier levels, each print is signed, numbered, stamped, with certificate of authenticity. 
Extra goodies may be created if we exceed our funding goals, which may include game mats and game coins. The first stretch goal to reach is the foil cards.

<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">Welcome to the Poltergeist: Pixelated Horror Indiegogo Campaign. This campaign's objective is to give us the resources needed to be able to help us complete and polish our videogame project ""Poltergeist: Pixelated Horror"".<br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">With your support, we will be able to have a very polished and refined product for everyone to enjoy. It will greatly help us to complete our vision we have for this project.<br/></span></span></p>
<p><img alt=""What is Poltergeist?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19843771/Polter_Blog/Indiegogo/Banner%202.png"" src="""" style=""""/><strong><em>Have you ever wondered what it feels to be a ghostly being?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>You have always lived happily in your manor. A manor that you managed to obtain with a lot of hard work and many personal sacrifices. Naturally you don't want anyone else to take care of it, not even in death!</em></p>
<p><em>But now, after your demise, many tenants have taken over it, and this is intolerable to you. Luckily, your love for your manor has granted you powers that will help you get rid of those pesky individuals.</em></p>
<p><em>Watch them run and scream, scaring them using your intelligence, wit, and with the use of powers like possessions, spectres, altering objects and more.</em></p>
<p><em>Have fun and play with the occult... and become a Poltergeist!</em></p>
<p>Poltergeist is a puzzle game for PC/Mac/Linux in which you are a ghost named Henry B. Knight. In which you will scare the tennants currently living in your house, so you can have some peace at last in the afterlife.</p>
<p>As a game, it will feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>A total of 60+ levels. These levels will occur in different time periods of the history of the manor.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>A variety of powers for you to control in each level: Lifting objects, possessing objects, invoking spectres and more.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Enemies, like priests and ghost hunters that will getting in your path of getting rid of everyone inside your manor. This will also include special ""boss"" characters in each time period.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps""><em class=""hps""><img alt=""Poltergeist concept"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19843771/Polter_Blog/Indiegogo/HenryB-Concept%203.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Poltergeist concept""/></em></span></span></p>

<div>
<p><img alt=""How do you play the game?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/19843771/Polter_Blog/Indiegogo/Banner%203.png"" src="""" style=""""/>Good question! Allow us to explain.</p>
<p>Poltergeist, as a puzzle game, will be divided in levels. In each level you will have a limited number of powers for you to use. You must use these powers with intelligence and <span class=""short_text"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">precision, so you can haunt all the tenants the are in the level.</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">But be careful, if you use all of your powers in a level, and not all of the tenants were haunted, you will lose. You must be careful to choose your power and where/when to use them!<br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">Usually powers will work in a specific ""room"". The execution of a power in a room will not afect characters who are outside of that room. This is important, because there are some powers that can affect various rooms with just one use.<br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">There will be also enemies. Priests, Ghost Hunters and other ""Boss"" characters are tougher thant normal ones, and they can and will block certain powers. If you use a power near one of these special characters, they will block it and it won't scare anyone.<br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">The objective of Poltergeist is not of ""seriousness"". It is a very light hearted take on the ghost concept by becoming the ghost itself. </span></span></p>
<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">It is designed to be fun, to feel more mischievous than actually evil. Pretty much like ""mustache twirling evil"" type. More of a playful little child that smirks every time he/she makes a prank on his neighbor.<br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">It is also not a game of mad skill and twitching. You will carefuly execute everyone of your actions carefully to finish each level. Think of ""Lemmings"", but without the extra pressure that game has (n_n).<br/></span></span></p>

<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">Poltergeist began as a simple idea and concept that started in November 2011. The idea was conceived by Diana Esperanza Pacheco (artist) and Italo F. Capasso B. (programmer).<br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">But it was only with the advent of a contest created by Square Enix, called the ""Latin American Game development contest 2012"", in which we really started to make this game a reality. We entered in the contest by creating a small prototype of our game. At that time we were just hoping we could get if only a mention of honor or even better, end up as a finalist.<br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">We had the very good fortune of getting the first prize of the contest! We got a super cool trophy and all (^0^).<br/></span></span></p>

<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps""><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">At this moment we are working on:</span></span></span></span></p>

<li><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps""><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">We are implementing new powers, which are Possesing Humans and Invoking Illusions.

<li><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps""><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">Also contributing to that variety.

<li><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps""><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">Although not super special, we are adding very simple image sequence cutscenes, to give some sense of a simple story to the game.<br/><br/></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps""><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">So any contribution we recieve will be greatly appreciated and will do wonders for us (n_n).<br/></span></span></span></span></p>

Use the powers at your disposition to haunt and scare them. Be a Poltergeist!

We are on Steam greenlight as well! Click on the image to go there!



Welcome to the Poltergeist: Pixelated Horror Indiegogo Campaign. This campaign's objective is to give us the resources needed to be able to help us complete and polish our videogame project ""Poltergeist: Pixelated Horror"".
With your support, we will be able to have a very polished and refined product for everyone to enjoy. It will greatly help us to complete our vision we have for this project.
Have you ever wondered what it feels to be a ghostly being?
You have always lived happily in your manor. A manor that you managed to obtain with a lot of hard work and many personal sacrifices. Naturally you don't want anyone else to take care of it, not even in death!
But now, after your demise, many tenants have taken over it, and this is intolerable to you. Luckily, your love for your manor has granted you powers that will help you get rid of those pesky individuals.
Watch them run and scream, scaring them using your intelligence, wit, and with the use of powers like possessions, spectres, altering objects and more.
Have fun and play with the occult... and become a Poltergeist!
Poltergeist is a puzzle game for PC/Mac/Linux in which you are a ghost named Henry B. Knight. In which you will scare the tennants currently living in your house, so you can have some peace at last in the afterlife.
As a game, it will feature:

A total of 60+ levels. These levels will occur in different time periods of the history of the manor.

A variety of powers for you to control in each level: Lifting objects, possessing objects, invoking spectres and more.

Enemies, like priests and ghost hunters that will getting in your path of getting rid of everyone inside your manor. This will also include special ""boss"" characters in each time period.




Good question! Allow us to explain.
Poltergeist, as a puzzle game, will be divided in levels. In each level you will have a limited number of powers for you to use. You must use these powers with intelligence and precision, so you can haunt all the tenants the are in the level.
But be careful, if you use all of your powers in a level, and not all of the tenants were haunted, you will lose. You must be careful to choose your power and where/when to use them!
Usually powers will work in a specific ""room"". The execution of a power in a room will not afect characters who are outside of that room. This is important, because there are some powers that can affect various rooms with just one use.
There will be also enemies. Priests, Ghost Hunters and other ""Boss"" characters are tougher thant normal ones, and they can and will block certain powers. If you use a power near one of these special characters, they will block it and it won't scare anyone.
The objective of Poltergeist is not of ""seriousness"". It is a very light hearted take on the ghost concept by becoming the ghost itself. 
It is designed to be fun, to feel more mischievous than actually evil. Pretty much like ""mustache twirling evil"" type. More of a playful little child that smirks every time he/she makes a prank on his neighbor.
It is also not a game of mad skill and twitching. You will carefuly execute everyone of your actions carefully to finish each level. Think of ""Lemmings"", but without the extra pressure that game has (n_n).



Alert: Call the nearest character to an area. Animals and special characters will always take heed before other characters.
Alter Object: Alters the selected object. Removes one scare point to everyone who is in the same room.
Launch Object: Launches the selected object to another room. Removes one scare point on start and end rooms.
Possess an Object: Possesses an object for a short time. Will cause two scare points.
Possess a Human (new for the current version fo the game): Will possess a human! The human will scare a lot and will also travel to a specified room, scaring everyone in its path! When the power vanishes, the ex-possessed character will run away in panic.
Invoke Spectre: Creates a spectre in an specific area. Removes two scare points.
Invoke an illusion (new for the current version fo the game): Creates an illusion that scares a character and forces her to move to the selected area.
Create a Portal: A portal. Very powerful, and we know you want it!



Normal characters: The normal characters just wander around the manor, waiting to be scared. They can talk and get distracted, but otherwise they are completely vulnerable to your powers!
Special characters (priest, ghost hunter): These characters are tough! They exist to make your haunting schemes more difficult, they are serious in their jobs and will block some of your powers whenever they can!
""Boss"" characters (new for the current version fo the game): In every era of your manor's history, there will be one level with an special character. They are tougher than special characters and can also block powers. Beware, they can be tricky!
""Epoch"" characters (new for the current version fo the game): Many more characters will exist in the house, according to the current historic era they ara living in!.

Poltergeist began as a simple idea and concept that started in November 2011. The idea was conceived by Diana Esperanza Pacheco (artist) and Italo F. Capasso B. (programmer).
But it was only with the advent of a contest created by Square Enix, called the ""Latin American Game development contest 2012"", in which we really started to make this game a reality. We entered in the contest by creating a small prototype of our game. At that time we were just hoping we could get if only a mention of honor or even better, end up as a finalist.
We had the very good fortune of getting the first prize of the contest! We got a super cool trophy and all (^0^).


You can see the results of the contest here:
http://close.latam.square-enix.com
Now, as of May 1st of 2013, the rights of our given were given back by Square Enix. This means the we now have the opportunity to really finish the game! We immediately started on making the full game, with more levels, better graphics and more gameplay mechanics.

At this moment, we still have the complete functional prototype. The consist of a grand total of 20 levels, and contains the basic implementation of the majority of powers, and the base mechanics, including enemies.
At this moment we are working on:

Reworking all of the sprites and creating new ones for the game. These new sprites and models include the objects of the other periods of history of the manor and the look of the tenants in different times. 
Overhauling the look and feel of the game with things like dynamic lighting and an improved user interface.
We are implementing new powers, which are Possesing Humans and Invoking Illusions. These will bring more variety to the game and have more ways to solve individual levels.
Also contributing to that variety. New mechanics as ""distractions"" and special ""boss"" characters will make the game richer and deeper in its core mechanics.
Although not super special, we are adding very simple image sequence cutscenes, to give some sense of a simple story to the game.
We only have 20-25 levels. Welp, time to make more!To make the game more interestings, more levels are the key to be able to fully exploit all of the mechanics we have in store for it.


Our work in Poltergeist has been during the Square Enix contest deadline, and after we got the rights back in May 1st 2013. And though the money we won from the contest has been of great use to us (basically living from it in the past 8 months), we still need more support to be able to finish this project faster.
We can, technically speaking, complete the project on our own (and we will!). But that would take more time for us, since we do not have the resources for us to be able to work on it full time without worry. It would also not be the superpolished game as we want it to be (for example, not having special stuff like commentary mode, more characters and sprites, more levels and whatnot). 
So any contribution we recieve will be greatly appreciated and will do wonders for us (n_n).

We would use the money for:

Paying an extra artist for a short time to help Diana with the new sprites and models of the game.
Paying for original music and audio.
Finance the rest of our work for the game in the future (you know, living and eating and stuff), with the ease of not having to worry on part-time jobs.
Formalizing Glitchy Pixel and creating an actual company (its needed of course, but also: This will be useful for talks of possibly porting the game on other platforms, and have it on multiple distribution platforms. But that is the super ideal case. No promises on that).
Pay the Indiegogo fess and local taxes.

We are going to use the ""Fixed Funding"" option of Indiegogo. This means that all of the money you contribute will only be charged if the target is reached and when the campaign ends.
Please note the we are going to finish this game no matter what. The campaign will help us is to just get it in a better state, with lots of polish and detail than we could ever do without funding. 
If we do not reach the target, well, it kinda sucks. Of course things will be a lot trickier, and the game will probably have a reduced scope than we have now, but it won't die (we can't let it die, really). 
We'd still work on the game (and keep you guys posted about it). But it definetly would take longer to finish it.


If you cannot contribute in our campaign with money, don't worry! There are other ways you can help us.

 
You can talk to your friend or acquaintances about this project. Or you could also share this campaign web page in your social networks, like Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit.
 
Note: Please do not to spam about this project to others. believe it or not, spamming actually will make us more harm than good. so please be always polite and share only once (n_n)b.
 
Remember, every little bit of sharing and contribution you do will help us in the making of this project. And of course we would really appreciate that!

Glitchy Pixel is an informal game development group created by it only two members: Diana Esperanza Pacheco and Italo F. Capasso B. Both are form Colombia - South America.
Since 2010 we have been creating games in our free time between jobs for entertainment.We have created a variety of projects, including games like Displaced, and Best Friends Fighter, the latter who won the ""Casual Game Design Competition #9"" at the website JayIsGames.
Glitchy Pixel also loves to participate in Game Jams, and has made some free small games for you to enjoy. Games like Time Travel Knight, Onryo's Legend, and The Rain and the Mist, are some of the free games created in game jams.

Name: Poltergeist: Pixelated Horror
Platforms: PC/Linux/Mac. Other platform TBD (if its even possible).
Genre: Horror Puzzle, but its fun instead of scary (^_^).
Release date: Probably early-mid 2014. It could be sooner, but no hard dates for now.
Current progress: Prototype with 20 levels and the foundation mechanics. Right now, working on an overhauled version.



I've seen games before with similar themes (Haunt the house, Ghost master, The haunting: starring Polterguy). Will there be any similarities in this game with these others?
To be honest, at the moment of the Square Enix contest, when we made the prototype, we had no idea about these games. We developed the game on our own, with none of these references. 
That said, of course we checked them as soon as we found out about them. And what we can say is that our game tends to be more of a puzzle to unravel, rather than a more action oriented game. 
You will have limited powers according to each levels and is not as easy to ""spam"" your powers. If you use all of your powers and there is still someone inside the level, you will lose. Each power is valuable and cannot be easily wasted.
And also, the reaction and current state of any character is very straightforward. You will clearly see when someone is about to run away, or completely sane. Its designed to be a clear distinct value, so you won't have any ambiguity problems when solving a level.

Are you the guys that made a similar game called Poltergeist: 16 bit horror?
Yes. In fact, that game is the very prototype we created for the contest. At the moment we chose that name... we can still choose it but we feel its better to say ""pixelated horror"" at the moment n_n.
In fact, if you wan to see more about that. Here is the first trailer we created for that contest n_n.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRFeqK9Hn9A

But, in the contest web page (and the previous video link) I saw that the game was released on iOS/Android. What gives? Has it been released already? Is this game going to be released in which platforms?
The Poltergeist: 16 bit horror prototype was briefly released on mobile devices, and on limited countries (only in some countries of Latin America, and we think also Canada for some reason) as per contest rules. When the contest period ended, Square Enix removed all contestant games immediately. You will not find the game in the mobile stores anymore.
Since we now have the rights back, we can make pretty much whatever we want with it. And that includes our plans to release it on PC/Mac/Linux.

Why not on mobile devices?
We believe we have a better opportunity in the pc market, since looks to be broader and more accessible to multiple distribution methods and easier ways to generate community. That said, there is no hard rule that we won't release it on mobile devices. We will definetly consider about it after releasing on PC/Mac/Linux.

Ok, well what about Steam, GoG, Desura, etc?
We cannot tell you for sure if we can get a steam, desura, humble store, etc. Rest assured that we will try everything we can to get these kinds of distributions methods avaliable to you. If you pledge on a tier that includes the game, no worries, you will definitely get it DRM Free in some form.

Consoles maybe?
Whoa. That would be awesome! But we cannot promise other platforms other than PC/Mac/Linux. Its usually not super easy to get set up for console making or something like that, specially in a country like Colombia. But we will do everything in our power to make it happen n_n.

You already won a contest, why making an Indiegogo campaign?
You can read our answer in the ""Why Indiegogo?"" section of this text.

You just couldn't write it up again, could you?
Well... yep. (''n_n).

If you don't reach the funding limit, what is going to happen?
Two things mught happen. One, we may have to reduce the scope of the game, and two, it will probably take mor time to finish, since we would have to work part-time in other jobs to survive.
 But we are still going to finish this game no matter what, so every contribution is worth it to at least gauge interest over it, even if we don't reach out target funding. And who know, even if we don't make it, it might help us to get funds from another source n_n.

What will happen IF you reach the target? Any stretch goals?
If we reach the target we will be very happy of course \(^_^)/. But we are NOT going to make any stretch goals. The reason is we already have defined the scope of our game and how we want it to be. Trying to promise you for new features just for the sake of it sounds weird for us, not our style. And since we are pitching the whole project to potential investors (for the record, you are the ""potential investors"" n_n), we are not going to add more design fluff to something we consider as complete.
Any extra money will be used for our future projects, and possibly for helping out our Latin American community of game developers, in some way or. But that would depend a lot of the amount we raise. We are not expecting too much money, just enough to cover our project (n_n)b.

In The Terminator movie, what would happen if John Connor never sends his friend back in the past, so it becomes his father so he can be born and then send his friend back in the past again?
We... have no idea actually. But when we get a time machine we will test the experiment and tell you all about it! If we don't blow up the universe that is \(^_^)/.

TL;DR?
If you like what you see in the video and campaign, please support us and share with others d(^o^)b! We would really appreciate any contribution from you.",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>Longsword: </b>Defending,
countering, and powerful attacks. It's all about waiting for your opponent to
make a mistake and then attack. Predict your opponents moves and counter, leaving
him helpless to your next attack. Patience is key!</div><div>
<b>Sword and Shield: </b>Blocking and bashing is everything in this class. Wear down your opponents stamina while preserving yours. Once you've tired your opponent down to the point when they can't even use their shield, it's time to attack!</div><div>
<b>Duel Wield Swords: </b>Combos are key in this class. The fighter must be able to time his combos to throw off his opponent's defense. To defend, you must predict your opponent's moves as well as have quick reflexes to dodge and block the incoming combo attacks.</div><div>
<b>Electric Staff:</b> Only the strong survive. Having a great offense is everything here. Pounding on your opponent until he passes out or can no longer stand will give you the win. Train your fighters up strong to be able to take the massive amount of damage while also dealing out as much pain.</div><div>
<b>and more! </b>These are just a few of the weapon classes that will be in the game. </div><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445756464/m3l0qxrsippzr00ryxwk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>These moves are subject to change for balancing and gameplay purposes.</div><div>
<b>Light and Heavy attacks: </b>Basic offensive moves that can be thrown in 4 directions. 2 up top on the shoulders and 2 on each side of the body. Light attacks are quick and low damage. Heavy attacks take longer but cause much more damage.</div><div>
<b>Block/Shield:</b> You can block in two directions unless you are using a shield. You have a high and low block. High blocks protect against attacks from the top. Low blocks protect against attacks on the sides of the body. If you're using a shield then blocking will block all attacks and stabs. However, if your opponent does a Bash/Kick on you while guarding you will be stunned. </div><div>
<b>Counter:</b> To counter you must hold down the counter/dodge modifier button and choose an attack button or stab button. That will launch a counter move against the attack you pressed. If timed right and the right move was countered against, you will stun your opponent. If the move fails it will take a while to recover so it's important to get it right!</div><div>
<b>Stab:</b> This thrusting move does a lot of damage and can change the tide of the match in a second! Stabs cause massive blood loss and can greatly injure your opponent. Stabs cannot be blocked unless you have a shield. While this move is powerful, it takes a while to ready the attack making it easy to counter and dodge.</div><div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Cut:</b> A cut is a state that can happen after a heavy attack. After a heavy attack is hit there is a chance that the weapon will cut through armour and flesh getting stuck in the opponent that sets up a hold. While in the Cut Hold, the attacker has three different moves to choose from to break the Cut Hold. One move causes more armour damage, another causes more blood loss and the last causes extra health loss. The defender must time a block move when the attacker chooses a move. If timed correctly, the defender will defend against the Cut Hold move and break free. If not then the attacker will do whatever damage move he chose.<br/>
</div><div>
<b>Dodge:</b> Dodges are the easiest defensive move to pull off because it is just a single button unlike Blocks and Counters. To pull off a dodge you must time the button press during an attack. Timed right, you will dodge the attack. Timed poorly, you will have a chance to be stunned while also taking normal damage. Also, fighters have an agility skill which will affect the chances of successful dodges. The higher the skill, the better the chance at a successful dodge.</div><div>
<b>Dash:</b> Quickly tap forwards or backwards to dash in that direction. This is useful for getting out of dangerous situations or getting back to the fight quickly.</div><div>
<b>Bash/Kick:</b> Bashes and kicks are moves to counter overly aggressive blockers. Bashing while your opponent is blocking will cause him to be stunned. To counter a Bash, just tap the dodge button at the right time or dash back away from the attack.</div><div>
<b>Taunt:</b> Feeling cocky and/or want to impress the crowd? Taunting is the move for that! Taunts are non-damaging moves that pump up the crowd and anger your opponent. But be careful, you're defenseless during it.</div><div>Remember, all moves are subject to change! Changes will be made to improve gameplay and balancing.

<b>Class E:</b> These are the other class of fighters in the WGE. These gladiators are signed in like regular fighters in the WGFA. These fighters usual fall into two groups, heroes and villains.

<span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial; font-weight: normal;"">The WGFA has clubs and shows. A club is an organization inside the division that employs fighters. They have their own training facilities and staff. The reason fighters choose to sign with clubs is so they can get into more prestigious fights and train with private staff and facilities. Fighters can choose to be independent but the fighter must hire his own trainer, find a gym and use an agent to find fights. Higher ranked fighters are more likely to be independent because they can afford to build their own facilities, hire staff and get any fight they want. </span><br/>
</h3><div>Shows are basically different leagues in the WGFA. Each show has a select number of weapon classes, each with their own title. Each show has different prestige levels. Higher prestige means the show has more money, as well as more valuable titles and fights. Each show has their own event scheduling practices. Some shows have events very often while others might just have a few each year making that show more rare and valuable. </div><div>The WGFA has rules to keep the fights as safe as possible while providing fans with brutal fights. To
win, a fighter must wear down his opponent until he collapses due to a lack of
blood, falls down and can't get up before a 10 count or by decision. The armour is provided by the WGFA for the fighters. There isn't any armour customization here.</div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445756802/v72thuiszbhfj4etvjnl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>The WGE has just 3 shows but has clubs just like the WGFA.

More gore and violence with a focus on purely entertaining the crowd rather than fighting competitively. Each match in both divisions will be fought with weapons from one the Weapon Classes. Each Class provides a unique gameplay experience. Each class will be able to use any move in the list below. But each move will differ in execution, speed and effectiveness over each weapon class.


Longsword: Defending,
countering, and powerful attacks. It's all about waiting for your opponent to
make a mistake and then attack. Predict your opponents moves and counter, leaving
him helpless to your next attack. Patience is key!
Sword and Shield: Blocking and bashing is everything in this class. Wear down your opponents stamina while preserving yours. Once you've tired your opponent down to the point when they can't even use their shield, it's time to attack!
Duel Wield Swords: Combos are key in this class. The fighter must be able to time his combos to throw off his opponent's defense. To defend, you must predict your opponent's moves as well as have quick reflexes to dodge and block the incoming combo attacks.
Electric Staff: Only the strong survive. Having a great offense is everything here. Pounding on your opponent until he passes out or can no longer stand will give you the win. Train your fighters up strong to be able to take the massive amount of damage while also dealing out as much pain.
and more! These are just a few of the weapon classes that will be in the game. These moves are subject to change for balancing and gameplay purposes.
Light and Heavy attacks: Basic offensive moves that can be thrown in 4 directions. 2 up top on the shoulders and 2 on each side of the body. Light attacks are quick and low damage. Heavy attacks take longer but cause much more damage.
Block/Shield: You can block in two directions unless you are using a shield. You have a high and low block. High blocks protect against attacks from the top. Low blocks protect against attacks on the sides of the body. If you're using a shield then blocking will block all attacks and stabs. However, if your opponent does a Bash/Kick on you while guarding you will be stunned. 
Counter: To counter you must hold down the counter/dodge modifier button and choose an attack button or stab button. That will launch a counter move against the attack you pressed. If timed right and the right move was countered against, you will stun your opponent. If the move fails it will take a while to recover so it's important to get it right!
Stab: This thrusting move does a lot of damage and can change the tide of the match in a second! Stabs cause massive blood loss and can greatly injure your opponent. Stabs cannot be blocked unless you have a shield. While this move is powerful, it takes a while to ready the attack making it easy to counter and dodge.
Cut: A cut is a state that can happen after a heavy attack. After a heavy attack is hit there is a chance that the weapon will cut through armour and flesh getting stuck in the opponent that sets up a hold. While in the Cut Hold, the attacker has three different moves to choose from to break the Cut Hold. One move causes more armour damage, another causes more blood loss and the last causes extra health loss. The defender must time a block move when the attacker chooses a move. If timed correctly, the defender will defend against the Cut Hold move and break free. If not then the attacker will do whatever damage move he chose.

Dodge: Dodges are the easiest defensive move to pull off because it is just a single button unlike Blocks and Counters. To pull off a dodge you must time the button press during an attack. Timed right, you will dodge the attack. Timed poorly, you will have a chance to be stunned while also taking normal damage. Also, fighters have an agility skill which will affect the chances of successful dodges. The higher the skill, the better the chance at a successful dodge.
Dash: Quickly tap forwards or backwards to dash in that direction. This is useful for getting out of dangerous situations or getting back to the fight quickly.
Bash/Kick: Bashes and kicks are moves to counter overly aggressive blockers. Bashing while your opponent is blocking will cause him to be stunned. To counter a Bash, just tap the dodge button at the right time or dash back away from the attack.
Taunt: Feeling cocky and/or want to impress the crowd? Taunting is the move for that! Taunts are non-damaging moves that pump up the crowd and anger your opponent. But be careful, you're defenseless during it.Remember, all moves are subject to change! Changes will be made to improve gameplay and balancing. Also if you have any suggestions or ideas for the gameplay email me at community@ignitionstudios.net.
Fighter Classes 
Class A: Top tier, major fighters in the WGFA.
Class B: Newer and/or minor fighters in the WGFA.
Class C: Criminals that are allow to fight in the WGE as cannon fodder, to shorten their sentence by showing mercy or to relieve anger out on other fighters rather than in the prisons.
Class E: These are the other class of fighters in the WGE. These gladiators are signed in like regular fighters in the WGFA. These fighters usual fall into two groups, heroes and villains. Heroes fight for the crowds and show mercy to their beaten opponents. Villains on the other hand, fight to kill and become the most notorious fighters in the WGE.
The WGFA has clubs and shows. A club is an organization inside the division that employs fighters. They have their own training facilities and staff. The reason fighters choose to sign with clubs is so they can get into more prestigious fights and train with private staff and facilities. Fighters can choose to be independent but the fighter must hire his own trainer, find a gym and use an agent to find fights. Higher ranked fighters are more likely to be independent because they can afford to build their own facilities, hire staff and get any fight they want. 
Shows are basically different leagues in the WGFA. Each show has a select number of weapon classes, each with their own title. Each show has different prestige levels. Higher prestige means the show has more money, as well as more valuable titles and fights. Each show has their own event scheduling practices. Some shows have events very often while others might just have a few each year making that show more rare and valuable. The WGFA has rules to keep the fights as safe as possible while providing fans with brutal fights. To
win, a fighter must wear down his opponent until he collapses due to a lack of
blood, falls down and can't get up before a 10 count or by decision. The armour is provided by the WGFA for the fighters. There isn't any armour customization here.The WGE has just 3 shows but has clubs just like the WGFA. Everything about how clubs manage and train fighters is the same. Fighters can still be independent as well.The 3 shows are all different levels of prestige. One at the highest prestige, one in the middle and one for establishing new fighters. Each show has it's one schedules as well and events are determined by the company.Rules are few and far between. Deaths happen at every event here. Match types are much more broader compared to the WGFA. Classic
one on one, team battles, king of the hill, horde and more. Armour is up to the fighter to provide. Repairs can be done in between rounds on both the fighter's armour and the fighter himself.Franchise ModeIn this mode, you own a club. You run how the club operates. Choose where the club is located, build and upgrade facilities, manage staff and sign fighters. You have full control on how your fighters train week by week. Manage sponsorships to make extra income and brand your fighters. But if you don't want to have to worry about the nitty gritty, you can assign the AI to control certain management jobs.As your fighter's events come up, you can either play them, watch the event or simulate. Career ModeYou are the fighter! Create your gladiator and choose a background. Then choose one of the four classes that are available. From here, do what you want! Sign with a club or try to cut it as an independent. Become the most notorious gladiator in the WGE or go for as many titles as you can in the WGFA. Manage how you train as well as how hard. Hire personal trainers and coaches. Even build your own facilities if you have the cash flow!Exhibition ModeThe easiest way to get into a fight. Fight against your friends or practice against the AI. Even set up AIs to fight each other.

I've been working hard on the game for about 3 months now and I'm really happy with how it's turning out. But, in order to continue to develop the game full time I need some income. This Indiegogo campaign will hopefully give me enough funds to get the game on steam early access or kickstarter.If the campaign gets above $40,000 then I won't have to do a kickstarter which would be lovely! If this is achieved then it'll be straight to Steam Early Access once the fighting system is done. If not, then kickstarter will be the next move once the fighting system is complete. I hope to get the fighting system fully featured in about 6-8 months.  I'll provide a roadmap on the website detailing the plans for future versions soon.



Food. Well, I think we all can agree that food is important.


Bills. Rent, utilities, basic living costs.

Business costs. Expenses that come with running a business.

Programs. Substance painter, Unity, Adobe products.

That's the basic necessities I need to make the game! If the minimum goal isn't met then development on the game will slow down quite a bit while I try to find a job. More on that below.




I want to be a game developer for the rest of my life and to grow this studio into the dream studio I've always wanted. I want this studio to work closely with the players because that's how good games are made! I need your opinions to help mold these games into something great!

Delays might happen for a number of reasons: Technical issues, unforseen circumstances or the need to polish the game further. I'll keep everyone updated if delays happen but hopefully we'll never have to go there! I'm going to work hard to get the game out as quickly as possible without sacrificing quality or my sanity. :)

If the minimum goal isn't met then development of the game will slow down quite a bit while I try to find a job. I will keep developing while working but I won't be able to get nearly as much done on the game. 
If the minimum goal is met then I'll be able to do this full time! I already talked about this up above in the ""Why indiegogo?"" section. I will start to introduce the stretch goals if we get closer to reaching the goals.

Ways to help out!
Spreading the word of the game is huge! Keeping in touch and providing constructive criticism will help make the game better! Links to contact me are down at the bottom or you can email me at community@ignitionstudios.net.

I want to incorporate your ideas and designs into the game. With that said there has to be rules to keep things from getting out of hand.

No copyrighted content in your designs.
No inappropriate, offensive or obscene content.
No foul language.
I reserve the right to approve and adjust the final designs.

I want you all to be creative and have fun! After the campaign is over, I'll get in touch with you via email and we'll go from there.",13.0,1,"1 Campaign

 Risks
This is the first time we are producing cards. Our main concern is that the printing might take longer than we anticipated, because it depends on many factors we do not control, like: (timely) availability of materials, and QA. We will update you if delivery times change - hopefully for the better.
BUT...
For Emoji graphics, and card designs we have Grigory. A talented, veteran artist. See: https://www.behance.net/grigorimagb05d
Sound and programming is our expertise at ChatFish. You can read more about us at http://www.chatfish.mobi
And we already found, tested, and signed an agreement with a very advanced printing shop that can create our unique cards (of high quality, and unique QR codes).

 
Stretch goals 

$115,000 - An extra set of Emojis + cards will be produced (for a total of 3 sets in the campaign). The Emoji group will be selected by a poll on our Facebook page.
$150,000 - Another extra set of Emojis + cards will be produced (for a total of 4 sets in the campaign). The Emoji group will be selected by a poll on our Facebook page.

</div></div>","Many computer gamers prefer the control, precision and comfort offered by a trackball, but find their device choices very limited. The market is flooded with gaming mice, but no trackball with the features, functions and form wanted by today’s gamers. GameBall is the answer. We designed GameBall from the ground up specifically for computer gaming. We are gamers ourselves and focused on creating a quality high-end trackball that can stand up to the demands and needs of gamers. In short, GameBall was built by computer gamers for computer gamers. 

Please select one of the perks on the right side of the page to support our campaign and help bring GameBall to life. 




GameBall is the first trackball developed specifically for the computer gamer. Its unique design and gaming specific features distinguish it from all other products on the market today. 




Even though GameBall was designed for gaming; it is a fully capable, everyday computer trackball. Its high precision controls make it perfect for 3D design work, video/picture editing, spreadsheets, or just web browsing. There is no need to switch devices between gaming and general computer use. GameBall does it all.



As a $69 Indiegogo Backer you will be one of the very few to own the world's first computer gaming trackball. In addition, you will receive a limited edition version known as “GameBall Ice” and become a GameBall Founder. Our full production version will be carbon black with red lighting and a red ball. While our limited edition will be carbon black with blue lighting and a blue ball. GameBall Ice will only be offered to Indiegogo Backers. GameBall Founders will receive special discounts and exclusives on future versions, new products and updates. Each Founder's name will be proudly displayed on the GameBall website.


We have teamed up with a leading trackball designer and manufacturer out of the United Kingdom. We have worked out the engineering, manufacturing and distribution processes. Following a successful campaign, GameBall will be sold only online. Eventually, we hope to have a presence with a major retailer and have global order fulfillment. The GameBall product website is already up and running and can be found at www.gamingtrackball.com. All we need now is you! 
Much time and effort has gone into preparing for this crowdfunding launch. Timelines, with contingencies, have been created for each development phase. At the completion of this successful campaign, we will move into full development. Indiegogo Backers will be kept up to date as we move through the production phases. Please see the key milestones in the timeline below:

The main challenges we face are associated with the manufacturing of the actual product. This is a new product with features not yet seen in a trackball.

László a magyar bestseller író évtizedek óta szórakoztatja közönségét különleges hangulatú, lebilincselően izgalmas kalandregényeivel. A regények főhőse Leslie L. Lawrence, a neves keletkutató és rovartudós, aki keresztül kasul bejárja a világot, s közben minduntalan misztikus, megoldhatatlannak tűnő rejtélyekbe botlik, melyeknek vaslogikája, kemény ökle és .38-as Smith &amp; Wessonja segítségével jár a végére. </span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b><i>IN ENGLISH</i></b></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Laszlo L.

readers for decades through his beautifully exciting adventure stories with special atmosphere. The main hero of these stories is Leslie L. Lawrence the noted orientalist and entomologist, who traverses through the length and breadth of the world, while constantly bumps into seemingly unsolvable mysteries, which he solves with the help of his iron logic, hard fist and .38 Smith &amp; Wesson.</span></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/196806/files/20131114041746-konyvek.jpg?1384431466"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>MAGYARUL</i></b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">A <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Lawrence regények különlegessége, hogy bár egytől egyig kitalált történetek, mégis mindegyikük valós helyszíneken játszódik, s mivel a regényekben feldolgozott legendáknak általában valamilyen valós gyökerük is van, a Lawrence könyvek nem csak szórakoztatóak, de komoly ismeretterjesztő jelleggel is bírnak.</span></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lőrincz L. László tanulmányai során
hosszú éveket töltött a Távol-Keleten,
ösztöndíjasként tanult az ulánbátori Állami Csojbalszan Egyetemen, valamint a
bonni Friedrich Wilhelm Egyetemen.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A tibeti és a
mongol folklór és irodalom, valamint e népek történelme képezi tudományos
munkásságának fő területeit. Mintegy 100 tudományos cikke jelent meg e
témakörökben, ezen kívül burját és mongol eposzokat fordít.</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Írói tevékenységét
ifjúsági regények írásával kezdte. Igazán népszerű íróvá azonban a nyolcvanas
évek elejétől megjelenő tudományos fantasztikus regényei, valamint a Galaktika
folyóiratban megjelent sci-fi novellái tették. Ezeket a Lőrincz L. László néven
megjelentetett műveket Galaktika-díjjal és Arany Meteor-díjjal jutalmazták.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>IN ENGLISH</i></b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Lawrence novels are unique, because while they are all made-up stories, all of them takes place in real places, and the processed legends usually have some real root. Therefore the Lawrence books are not only fun to read, but also has serious educational value.<br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">During his studies, Lorincz L. Laszlo spent long
years in the Far East, he studied at the Mongolian State (Choybalsan) University in Ulaanbaatar and at the
Friedrich Wilhelm University of Bonn.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The main areas of his scientific works
are the Tibetan and Mongolian folklore and literature, furthermore the history
of these nations. He has over 100 publications in these areas; besides that, he
translates Buryat and Mongolian epic poems.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">He started his career as a writer by
writing juvenile literature. However, he really became popular by his
science-fiction novels published in the early 80’s and his sci-fi short stories
published in the magazine Galaktika. These works written under the name Laszlo L. Lorincz were honored by the Galaktika Award and the Arany Meteor (Gold
Meteor) award.</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/196857/files/20131114051038-lll2.jpg?1384434638"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b><i>MAGYARUL</i></b><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Leslie L. Lawrence írói álnéven kiadott első munkája, a 'Sindzse Szeme' hozta meg számára az országos népszerűséget. E néven publikált, többségében keleti tárgyú kalandregényeiben ötvöződik a biztonsággal kezelt tudományos ismeretek és a kutatások során felhalmozott tapasztalatok ismeretterjesztő szándéka, valamint a fordulatos, izgalmas cselekmény. Ez a kettősség — a tudományos háttér és az élvezetes olvasmányosság — adja műveinek igazi értékét.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Regényei nemcsak hazánkban, de külföldön is igen népszerűek. Németországban, a volt Szovjetunióban, Szlovákiában, Csehországban, Lengyelországban, Bulgáriában és Franciaországban is jelentek meg művei.</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Munkájának része
és szenvedélye az utazás. A mai napig is lehetőség szerint regényeinek minden
helyszínét felkeresi, hogy az <span>adott
országnak és az ott élő népek kultúrájának minél szemléletesebb leírását tudja
adni.</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Lőrincz L. László könnyed, sokszor humoros, egyedi stílusát nagyon könnyű megszeretni, és ha valakit egyszer magával ragad történeteinek különleges hangulata, nagyon hamar rajongóvá válik.</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Valószínűleg ennek is köszönhető, hogy az elmúlt 40 évben több mint 80 </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Lőrincz L. László kötet jelent meg, melyek túlnyomó többsége Leslie L. Lawrence kalandjait dolgozza fel.</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b><i>IN ENGLISH</i></b><br/></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">His first work published under the pen-name Leslie L. Lawrence, Sindzse Szeme (Eye of Shinje) brought him national fame. The adventure novels published under this name, which usually take place in the East, combine scientific knowledge handled confidently, a wish to propagate knowledge gained during the research and a thrilling story full of surprises. This double nature – the scientific background and the delightful readability – give the real value of these works.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">His novels are popular not only in Hungary but also abroad. He has works published in Germany, in the former Soviet Union, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Bulgaria and France.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">A part of his job and also his passion is traveling and even today, if possible, he travels to every place pictured in his works to be able to give a most vivid description of the given country and the culture of its nations.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The light, often humorous, unique style of Lorincz L. Laszlo is very easy to like, and if once you're stuck by the unique feeling of these stories, you'll very quickly become a fan.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most likely this is one of the reasons that over the past 40 years, more than 80 Lorincz L. Laszlo volume was published, and the vast majority of these are about Leslie L. Lawrence's adventures.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">A Keselyűk Gyászzenéje<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">(Requiem of the Vultures)</span></b></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b><i>MAGYARUL</i></b></span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Cégünk a Mystery Interactive nem kisebb feladatot tűzött maga elé, mint hogy egy multi-platform kalandjáték keretein belül feldolgozza az egyik legnépszerűbb Leslie L.

Leslie L. Lawrence ...(My name is Lawrence. Leslie L. Lawrence ...)MAGYARULLőrincz L. László a magyar bestseller író évtizedek óta szórakoztatja közönségét különleges hangulatú, lebilincselően izgalmas kalandregényeivel. A regények főhőse Leslie L. Lawrence, a neves keletkutató és rovartudós, aki keresztül kasul bejárja a világot, s közben minduntalan misztikus, megoldhatatlannak tűnő rejtélyekbe botlik, melyeknek vaslogikája, kemény ökle és .38-as Smith & Wessonja segítségével jár a végére. IN ENGLISHLaszlo L. Lorincz, the Hungarian bestseller novelist entertained his
readers for decades through his beautifully exciting adventure stories with special atmosphere. The main hero of these stories is Leslie L. Lawrence the noted orientalist and entomologist, who traverses through the length and breadth of the world, while constantly bumps into seemingly unsolvable mysteries, which he solves with the help of his iron logic, hard fist and .38 Smith & Wesson.MAGYARULA Lawrence regények különlegessége, hogy bár egytől egyig kitalált történetek, mégis mindegyikük valós helyszíneken játszódik, s mivel a regényekben feldolgozott legendáknak általában valamilyen valós gyökerük is van, a Lawrence könyvek nem csak szórakoztatóak, de komoly ismeretterjesztő jelleggel is bírnak.Lőrincz L. László tanulmányai során
hosszú éveket töltött a Távol-Keleten,
ösztöndíjasként tanult az ulánbátori Állami Csojbalszan Egyetemen, valamint a
bonni Friedrich Wilhelm Egyetemen.
A tibeti és a
mongol folklór és irodalom, valamint e népek történelme képezi tudományos
munkásságának fő területeit. Mintegy 100 tudományos cikke jelent meg e
témakörökben, ezen kívül burját és mongol eposzokat fordít.Írói tevékenységét
ifjúsági regények írásával kezdte. Igazán népszerű íróvá azonban a nyolcvanas
évek elejétől megjelenő tudományos fantasztikus regényei, valamint a Galaktika
folyóiratban megjelent sci-fi novellái tették. Ezeket a Lőrincz L. László néven
megjelentetett műveket Galaktika-díjjal és Arany Meteor-díjjal jutalmazták.IN ENGLISHThe Lawrence novels are unique, because while they are all made-up stories, all of them takes place in real places, and the processed legends usually have some real root. Therefore the Lawrence books are not only fun to read, but also has serious educational value.During his studies, Lorincz L. Laszlo spent long
years in the Far East, he studied at the Mongolian State (Choybalsan) University in Ulaanbaatar and at the
Friedrich Wilhelm University of Bonn.
The main areas of his scientific works
are the Tibetan and Mongolian folklore and literature, furthermore the history
of these nations. He has over 100 publications in these areas; besides that, he
translates Buryat and Mongolian epic poems.
He started his career as a writer by
writing juvenile literature. However, he really became popular by his
science-fiction novels published in the early 80’s and his sci-fi short stories
published in the magazine Galaktika. These works written under the name Laszlo L. Lorincz were honored by the Galaktika Award and the Arany Meteor (Gold
Meteor) award.MAGYARULLeslie L. Lawrence írói álnéven kiadott első munkája, a 'Sindzse Szeme' hozta meg számára az országos népszerűséget. E néven publikált, többségében keleti tárgyú kalandregényeiben ötvöződik a biztonsággal kezelt tudományos ismeretek és a kutatások során felhalmozott tapasztalatok ismeretterjesztő szándéka, valamint a fordulatos, izgalmas cselekmény. Ez a kettősség — a tudományos háttér és az élvezetes olvasmányosság — adja műveinek igazi értékét.Regényei nemcsak hazánkban, de külföldön is igen népszerűek. Németországban, a volt Szovjetunióban, Szlovákiában, Csehországban, Lengyelországban, Bulgáriában és Franciaországban is jelentek meg művei.Munkájának része
és szenvedélye az utazás. A mai napig is lehetőség szerint regényeinek minden
helyszínét felkeresi, hogy az adott
országnak és az ott élő népek kultúrájának minél szemléletesebb leírását tudja
adni.Lőrincz L. László könnyed, sokszor humoros, egyedi stílusát nagyon könnyű megszeretni, és ha valakit egyszer magával ragad történeteinek különleges hangulata, nagyon hamar rajongóvá válik.Valószínűleg ennek is köszönhető, hogy az elmúlt 40 évben több mint 80 Lőrincz L. László kötet jelent meg, melyek túlnyomó többsége Leslie L. Lawrence kalandjait dolgozza fel.IN ENGLISHHis first work published under the pen-name Leslie L. Lawrence, Sindzse Szeme (Eye of Shinje) brought him national fame. The adventure novels published under this name, which usually take place in the East, combine scientific knowledge handled confidently, a wish to propagate knowledge gained during the research and a thrilling story full of surprises. This double nature – the scientific background and the delightful readability – give the real value of these works.His novels are popular not only in Hungary but also abroad. He has works published in Germany, in the former Soviet Union, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland, Bulgaria and France.A part of his job and also his passion is traveling and even today, if possible, he travels to every place pictured in his works to be able to give a most vivid description of the given country and the culture of its nations.The light, often humorous, unique style of Lorincz L. Laszlo is very easy to like, and if once you're stuck by the unique feeling of these stories, you'll very quickly become a fan.Most likely this is one of the reasons that over the past 40 years, more than 80 Lorincz L. Laszlo volume was published, and the vast majority of these are about Leslie L. Lawrence's adventures.A Keselyűk Gyászzenéje(Requiem of the Vultures)MAGYARULCégünk a Mystery Interactive nem kisebb feladatot tűzött maga elé, mint hogy egy multi-platform kalandjáték keretein belül feldolgozza az egyik legnépszerűbb Leslie L.

<p><strong>What exactly is Masters of Cetrea? And why another campaign setting?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Good question. Let me begin by telling you what our project is all about. Obviously, we are offering you a whole new campaign setting, yes, fully compatible with <i><strong>the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</strong>.</i> A shiny new world for you to play in. At the very soul of our project, though, is the intention to show you a different way of enjoying the game we all know and love. Our approach has always been to focus the game on the characters. All good stories are like that.</p>
<p>Masters of Cetrea introduces not only a different location, but several variations on the game to allow you to play differently. We focus on the narrative elements of the game: characters, plot, choices. This does not mean we forget about rules or the other parts of the game, but our main line is designed to provide both GMs and Players with interesting options and elements to build epic campaigns, filled with memorable moments and plot-twists. The campaign setting books will be featuring not only new races, classes and options for Player Characters, or new monsters and dungeons for the GM. They are packed with clever ways to give more power to the players and GM's decisions: ways to tweak or bend the rules into what you want them to be in order to suit your gaming style. Make your adventures a bit more like your favorite movies, series, comic-books or novels.</p>
<p>Besides the Masters of Cetrea line, we have some other stuff: generic “any-world-friendly” adventures, suitable to fill the gaps between your own campaign adventures, or to have a happy dungeon delving night, and books full of rules and options to change the face of your game: these will introduce new mechanics into the game-engine, allowing you to tell more stories and make them more engaging. So, we have a lot of things for you, besides merely more castles with slightly different names.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Okay... but what about Cetrea? I wanna know your world.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Glad you asked. Cetrea is different from most worlds, because it was not born as a game setting. First it housed stories and philosophies created for their own sake. That let it grow in a very organic way, and develop its own features at its own pace. Instead of adapting the world to the mechanics, we had the chance to see our realm evolve in its own terms, and then we came up with clever ways to adapt the mechanics to what our world was all about. Most “narrative” in many worlds is created to match the cosmologies of the most popular settings, as to fit the rules into them. The same planes, the same concepts... deities, for instance, are pretty much merely a game-mechanic than a part of an actual world. Cetrea's roots are not those. Deities in Cetrea are there to offer mysteries to the game, to generate plots, not only to grant spells or to provide answers via spells. While most rules and mechanics can be used as they are, it includes many variants for all kinds of aspects: new rules for alignments (which have something to do with the Elements), new classes, new rules for magic allowing to bypass the annoying “prepare your spells” system without totally breaking the game. Cetrea is designed to empower imagination instead of restricting it.</p>
<p>First and foremost, Cetrea is a very young world, created by deities mostly unknown by mortals, collectively named <i>the Faceless Gods,</i> as no one seems to have ever seen them. These Deities rarely ever interact with mortals; they simply create and observe. The general ignorance about their purposes, goals and even nature or identity has lead to a myriad of religions, each focused on very different aspects of divinity and life (and death). Religious conflicts, then, are frequent and harsh.</p>
<p>That said, one of few things all people seem to accept is that every living creature has a soul, and when it dies, its soul only fades into the Life-force before coming back to the creation, as a new entity. Reincarnation is what keeps the universe moving, as it allows souls to become better (or worse). It also makes honor and disgrace more meaningful, as they can affect the next life of any person: heroes may return, still trying to make good on an unfulfilled oath, and villains still holding ancient grudges. Besides that, Reincarnation prevents creatures from being resurrected; a soul cannot be returned to a body once they have been parted, and trying to prevent it from following the cycle may result in great evil taking shape.</p>
<p>Now, as the deities themselves rarely ever intervene in their own creation, they appointed their agents, known as <i>the Masters</i> by the mortal races, to watch over the world. These mysterious keepers – and often breakers – of the status quo act secretively to bring order or chaos into the world, according to their own intricate agendas. It is said that the will of the Masters is what truly rules fate, as their alliances and rivalries often involve mortal nations and champions in deadly conflicts that may last for decades or even centuries.</p>
<p>And speaking of mortals, Cetrea is different in one more way. Dragons, not humans, have been the dominant race of the world for a long time. Only recently the Draconian Empire has fallen, and so in this period of transition the other races struggle to fill the power gaps. All of Cetrea's races are different, not only in their game-mechanics, but also in their philosophies and cultures, allowing for deeper development of characters, but also influencing the rules and options available for them.</p>
<p>Magic in Cetrea is a force that most can see, but not many can control. The prodigious artifacts of the Masters have slipped into oblivion, and the weapons and marvels crafted by the dragons are now part of a disorganized black market. Powerful spellcasters are a rarity, since only a few can truly master any of the three paths of magic: Arcane, Natural and Spiritual. As a result, magic is not as prominent as it is in most settings, making things quite grittier than they are in other fantasy realms: magical healing has limits, and it is not widely available, while truly powerful spells are only available to creatures of godlike power, such as the deities themselves, the Masters and the feared Titans. In short, magic is not there to allow regular people to cut corners or have it the easy way in most scenarios.</p>
<p>Another thing that has major relevance in Cetrea, unlike in most settings, are dreams. Dreams allow Masters and other entities to contact mortals, but also allow mortals to visit other Planes with relative safety, without the need for any special magic to be used. Dreams communicate truths too dark to be perceived in “reality”, and nightmares may be as perilous as the vilest dungeon. Many have lost their sanity, their lives and even their souls by carelessly wandering the Dreamscape, yet for some reason it calls out to all mortals. What will you find there, and how will it affect your “reality”?</p>
<p>Finally, the most important themes in Cetrea are both Fate and Freedom. Some things are meant to be, yet many try to defy destiny. Many have claimed that running away from Fate only makes it come sooner. Will you be compelled to do as you are supposed to, or will you defy destiny and break its chains? What the consequences of such a defiance will be?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>But, who are you, guys? Why support a completely new project?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well, both of us have worked on the publishing world for some time. Besides that, we have always been passionate writers and story-makers, only it had been merely a hobby until now. We created the world of Cetrea by adding a character here, a story there, a legend, and then a few details, and it kept growing silently, witnessed by no one but us and a few friends. However, we believe that Cetrea has become a project too large to remain merely a leisure-time sandbox. We know a bit about making books, so publishing the materials we have on our world felt like the next logical step.</p>
<p>Why to support us? The simple answer is because we are new. New is good. Fresh ideas should always be welcomed, in any context or area of knowledge. We have something different to say. We like to question what has been said before. We have a point of view that no one else had.</p>
<p>Another answer is that we want to do this. Cetrea is happening. With your help it can be done sooner and better. So to speak, we are merely looking for an excuse to make this books; we are not working on something we hate, filling our hours and then forgetting all about Masters of Cetrea until we have to come back to the office. We love what we do. We love our world. We are thinking of it more than of any other thing each and every day. This kind of commitment is our guarantee that you will get what we are promising and more. Let us bring Cetrea to you as fast as possible and with the quality you deserve. The whole thing is already created; putting it into books for you is all that remains.</p>
<p>Final answer: you are getting stuff out of it! Sweet, right?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How else can I help?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>While the obvious way is to contribute with this campaign, and we urge you to do so, there are some other ways you can help us. Start by talking to your friends about this project. Share the link, spread the word. Give us some likes and make this thing viral. Help us get to more people, so they can join forces too! The more people in it, the better our products and your rewards.</p>
<p>If you want to do even more you can donate your artwork to us, and have it appear in our books and website, fully credited and visible to all of our audience, not as fan-art but as official Masters of Cetrea artwork. We cannot use everything, and we may have to be a bit picky, as Cetrea means a lot to us. If you wish to try your hand, there are two ways:</p>
<p>1. You can let us know you are available for a free commission, and send us a piece of artwork that represents your work. In time we will contact you and thank you for your support, and we may add a request for you. As you are donating your work, we'll give no deadlines. You are not even obligated to actually take the commission, but if you want to do it, we will need to know when we can expect your work. If you are unable to finish it, or need more time, it's okay; just make sure you let us know, please. When it is ready, we'll inform you when it gets published.</p>
<p>2. If you have a piece of art that suits the project and has not been published, or decide to create something expressly for it, based on what you have seen so far, you can send it to us, declaring that you wish to donate your work and that it was made by you. We will thank you appropriately and inform you if it will be published, and when.</p>
<p>Please, if you wish to contribute with artwork, be honest. Make sure you submit something we can use without any issues. Do not send artwork owed by third-parties or made by someone else without permission of the artist and/or owner. We appreciate your help, but mind the law and copyrights.</p>
<p>Finally, I ask you once more: try to donate some money, if you have not done so yet. No matter how “small” your collaboration is, it is huge for us. Your support means a lot, and it can make the difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>And what will you do with the money? Partying hard, right?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not really. In fact, most of it will be used to upgrade our equipment. Offering you the best quality means that we need to have the best quality as well. Most of our production happens digitally, as you may well suspect, so having the things necessary to create the artwork and the books is essential; computers, supplies, the occasional need to license fonts and stuff like that... all those require us to invest on them.</p>
<p>Another priority of our team is to put up our website and make sure it stays functional no matter what. Not only it will be our main channel of communication with you guys, but it will also be the place where we will publish lots of free stuff: maps, designer's insight, trivia, and all the basic information of Cetrea that would take forever to be published in books, will be featured there, so you have all data you need to build a whole campaign at hand and without paying a cent for it! Last, but clearly not least, it will also be our main sales platform, as our web store will be there too, along with all the information and teasers on our upcoming products, including summaries on the books to be published, release dates and trial versions when available.</p>
<p>All that said, having people working with us in this project also requires money. Convincing people join our team and devote their time to creating products for you instead of pursuing any other activity means we have to pay them. Even if the main team were to work on Cetrea for free, then we would necessarily divert time and effort from our publishing to focus on paying the rent, publishing slowly and sporadically, which would end up annoying you as much as us. Not to say that we also need to pay people from outside the team to have the books printed and sent to you, for instance, so there is no way around the fact that people's work is not for free.</p>
<p>That is pretty much it. We will gladly respond to your questions and we wish you choose to help us bring Cetrea to life. <i><strong>Thank you!</strong></i></p>

They are packed with clever ways to give more power to the players and GM's decisions: ways to tweak or bend the rules into what you want them to be in order to suit your gaming style. Make your adventures a bit more like your favorite movies, series, comic-books or novels.
Besides the Masters of Cetrea line, we have some other stuff: generic “any-world-friendly” adventures, suitable to fill the gaps between your own campaign adventures, or to have a happy dungeon delving night, and books full of rules and options to change the face of your game: these will introduce new mechanics into the game-engine, allowing you to tell more stories and make them more engaging. So, we have a lot of things for you, besides merely more castles with slightly different names.
 
Okay... but what about Cetrea? I wanna know your world.
 
Glad you asked. Cetrea is different from most worlds, because it was not born as a game setting. First it housed stories and philosophies created for their own sake. That let it grow in a very organic way, and develop its own features at its own pace. Instead of adapting the world to the mechanics, we had the chance to see our realm evolve in its own terms, and then we came up with clever ways to adapt the mechanics to what our world was all about. Most “narrative” in many worlds is created to match the cosmologies of the most popular settings, as to fit the rules into them. The same planes, the same concepts... deities, for instance, are pretty much merely a game-mechanic than a part of an actual world. Cetrea's roots are not those. Deities in Cetrea are there to offer mysteries to the game, to generate plots, not only to grant spells or to provide answers via spells. While most rules and mechanics can be used as they are, it includes many variants for all kinds of aspects: new rules for alignments (which have something to do with the Elements), new classes, new rules for magic allowing to bypass the annoying “prepare your spells” system without totally breaking the game. Cetrea is designed to empower imagination instead of restricting it.
First and foremost, Cetrea is a very young world, created by deities mostly unknown by mortals, collectively named the Faceless Gods, as no one seems to have ever seen them. These Deities rarely ever interact with mortals; they simply create and observe. The general ignorance about their purposes, goals and even nature or identity has lead to a myriad of religions, each focused on very different aspects of divinity and life (and death). Religious conflicts, then, are frequent and harsh.
That said, one of few things all people seem to accept is that every living creature has a soul, and when it dies, its soul only fades into the Life-force before coming back to the creation, as a new entity. Reincarnation is what keeps the universe moving, as it allows souls to become better (or worse). It also makes honor and disgrace more meaningful, as they can affect the next life of any person: heroes may return, still trying to make good on an unfulfilled oath, and villains still holding ancient grudges. Besides that, Reincarnation prevents creatures from being resurrected; a soul cannot be returned to a body once they have been parted, and trying to prevent it from following the cycle may result in great evil taking shape.
Now, as the deities themselves rarely ever intervene in their own creation, they appointed their agents, known as the Masters by the mortal races, to watch over the world. These mysterious keepers – and often breakers – of the status quo act secretively to bring order or chaos into the world, according to their own intricate agendas. It is said that the will of the Masters is what truly rules fate, as their alliances and rivalries often involve mortal nations and champions in deadly conflicts that may last for decades or even centuries.
And speaking of mortals, Cetrea is different in one more way. Dragons, not humans, have been the dominant race of the world for a long time. Only recently the Draconian Empire has fallen, and so in this period of transition the other races struggle to fill the power gaps. All of Cetrea's races are different, not only in their game-mechanics, but also in their philosophies and cultures, allowing for deeper development of characters, but also influencing the rules and options available for them.
Magic in Cetrea is a force that most can see, but not many can control. The prodigious artifacts of the Masters have slipped into oblivion, and the weapons and marvels crafted by the dragons are now part of a disorganized black market. Powerful spellcasters are a rarity, since only a few can truly master any of the three paths of magic: Arcane, Natural and Spiritual. As a result, magic is not as prominent as it is in most settings, making things quite grittier than they are in other fantasy realms: magical healing has limits, and it is not widely available, while truly powerful spells are only available to creatures of godlike power, such as the deities themselves, the Masters and the feared Titans. In short, magic is not there to allow regular people to cut corners or have it the easy way in most scenarios.
Another thing that has major relevance in Cetrea, unlike in most settings, are dreams. Dreams allow Masters and other entities to contact mortals, but also allow mortals to visit other Planes with relative safety, without the need for any special magic to be used. Dreams communicate truths too dark to be perceived in “reality”, and nightmares may be as perilous as the vilest dungeon. Many have lost their sanity, their lives and even their souls by carelessly wandering the Dreamscape, yet for some reason it calls out to all mortals. What will you find there, and how will it affect your “reality”?
Finally, the most important themes in Cetrea are both Fate and Freedom. Some things are meant to be, yet many try to defy destiny. Many have claimed that running away from Fate only makes it come sooner. Will you be compelled to do as you are supposed to, or will you defy destiny and break its chains? What the consequences of such a defiance will be?
 
But, who are you, guys? Why support a completely new project?
 
Well, both of us have worked on the publishing world for some time. Besides that, we have always been passionate writers and story-makers, only it had been merely a hobby until now. We created the world of Cetrea by adding a character here, a story there, a legend, and then a few details, and it kept growing silently, witnessed by no one but us and a few friends. However, we believe that Cetrea has become a project too large to remain merely a leisure-time sandbox. We know a bit about making books, so publishing the materials we have on our world felt like the next logical step.
Why to support us? The simple answer is because we are new. New is good. Fresh ideas should always be welcomed, in any context or area of knowledge. We have something different to say. We like to question what has been said before. We have a point of view that no one else had.
Another answer is that we want to do this. Cetrea is happening. With your help it can be done sooner and better. So to speak, we are merely looking for an excuse to make this books; we are not working on something we hate, filling our hours and then forgetting all about Masters of Cetrea until we have to come back to the office. We love what we do. We love our world. We are thinking of it more than of any other thing each and every day. This kind of commitment is our guarantee that you will get what we are promising and more. Let us bring Cetrea to you as fast as possible and with the quality you deserve. The whole thing is already created; putting it into books for you is all that remains.
Final answer: you are getting stuff out of it! Sweet, right?
 
How else can I help?
 
While the obvious way is to contribute with this campaign, and we urge you to do so, there are some other ways you can help us. Start by talking to your friends about this project. Share the link, spread the word. Give us some likes and make this thing viral. Help us get to more people, so they can join forces too! The more people in it, the better our products and your rewards.
If you want to do even more you can donate your artwork to us, and have it appear in our books and website, fully credited and visible to all of our audience, not as fan-art but as official Masters of Cetrea artwork. We cannot use everything, and we may have to be a bit picky, as Cetrea means a lot to us. If you wish to try your hand, there are two ways:
1. You can let us know you are available for a free commission, and send us a piece of artwork that represents your work. In time we will contact you and thank you for your support, and we may add a request for you. As you are donating your work, we'll give no deadlines. You are not even obligated to actually take the commission, but if you want to do it, we will need to know when we can expect your work. If you are unable to finish it, or need more time, it's okay; just make sure you let us know, please. When it is ready, we'll inform you when it gets published.
2. If you have a piece of art that suits the project and has not been published, or decide to create something expressly for it, based on what you have seen so far, you can send it to us, declaring that you wish to donate your work and that it was made by you. We will thank you appropriately and inform you if it will be published, and when.
Please, if you wish to contribute with artwork, be honest. Make sure you submit something we can use without any issues. Do not send artwork owed by third-parties or made by someone else without permission of the artist and/or owner. We appreciate your help, but mind the law and copyrights.
Finally, I ask you once more: try to donate some money, if you have not done so yet. No matter how “small” your collaboration is, it is huge for us. Your support means a lot, and it can make the difference.
 
And what will you do with the money? Partying hard, right?
 
Not really. In fact, most of it will be used to upgrade our equipment. Offering you the best quality means that we need to have the best quality as well. Most of our production happens digitally, as you may well suspect, so having the things necessary to create the artwork and the books is essential; computers, supplies, the occasional need to license fonts and stuff like that... all those require us to invest on them.
Another priority of our team is to put up our website and make sure it stays functional no matter what. Not only it will be our main channel of communication with you guys, but it will also be the place where we will publish lots of free stuff: maps, designer's insight, trivia, and all the basic information of Cetrea that would take forever to be published in books, will be featured there, so you have all data you need to build a whole campaign at hand and without paying a cent for it! Last, but clearly not least, it will also be our main sales platform, as our web store will be there too, along with all the information and teasers on our upcoming products, including summaries on the books to be published, release dates and trial versions when available.
All that said, having people working with us in this project also requires money. Convincing people join our team and devote their time to creating products for you instead of pursuing any other activity means we have to pay them. Even if the main team were to work on Cetrea for free, then we would necessarily divert time and effort from our publishing to focus on paying the rent, publishing slowly and sporadically, which would end up annoying you as much as us. Not to say that we also need to pay people from outside the team to have the books printed and sent to you, for instance, so there is no way around the fact that people's work is not for free.
That is pretty much it. We will gladly respond to your questions and we wish you choose to help us bring Cetrea to life. Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Multi-Day Real World Mission in The Black Watchmen Universe. For less than $200, you
can be part of a small group of Agents participating in a real world mission created
just for us. It’s hard to fly anywhere for less than that anymore, and we can
bring it here. We need you, to help make the world more exciting!


*The mission must
take place in the red zone. Red zone is for mission loading and unloading only.
And
the game doesn’t end with the mission. The mission if just one part of a
greater conspiracy that will shape the future of The Black Watchmen ARG. Don't
know what an Alternate Reality Game is? Don't worry, a few years ago I didn't
either. An ARG immerses you in a virtual world where your wits and skills in
the real world are just as important as those in the game. Learn all about the experience
from Alice & Smith as well as from those that have experienced their
work.
Full
disclosure, I am not affiliated with Alice & Smith beyond working with them to create this experience. I am a fan
who wishes to bring something exciting to the Midwest, as well as see the Black
Watchmen succeed!
   


The cost of the Swat Team -
Real World Mission (created just for this
campaign) is $5000 Canadian. That works out to just about $4603 US at the
moment. In order to cover the fees for this campaign, we will be raising $4728
and I'll cover the remaining $208 as my pledge. 
Since this is important it will
probably get repeated: I'll make the pledge via Kickstarter to help Alice
& Smith’s campaign, but even if the Kickstarter does not succeed, we will
be giving the proceeds to Alice & Smith and they will be hosting the
mission for us and providing the perks.




I chose US dollars for ease of use and to lower fees. If the Canadian dollar gets stronger during the campaign, I will pick up any extra costs.



An
adventure right here in the Midwest, where you play a leading role, is not enough? You
also get an equal vote on the time and place (Midwest only) of the event so you
can be sure it’s close to home for you (seeing as you have to provide your own transportation to the mission).Still not enough you say?  Every Agent will receive the seven awesome
perks from Alice & Smith below; as well as a poker chip exclusively created for this event and the
chance to win a hat, dog tags, or even an army jacket. Of course you will also receive full access to The Black
Watchmen game for the first season (if the Kickstarter succeeds). For more
details on these and the other rewards, check them
out here.
*Every agent will receive the rewards above.





*Three lucky agents
will earn one of the items above. One of each item is available for the team.








What if the Kickstarter for The Black Watchmen doesn't succeed? Alice & Smith have committed to bringing us our mission and perks regardless! 


What if you can't make it? If you can't be on site, you can take part as a virtual agent and be with us every step of the way, as well as receive all the perks above.


What if we don't meet our goal in this campaign? As a Fixed Goal Campaign, all the money will be refunded automatically by Indiegogo if it doesn't succeed. 

What if we can't decide a location or time? I plan to host several rounds of votes, where we slowly narrow the field and have a random number tie breaker. In the end it comes down to the will of the majority, or how good you are at convincing others.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Q: So, why did you decide to port to the SMD?</p>
<p>A: We honestly fell in love with this and new that this would be the best way to share it with everyone.</p>
<p>However, there are a few changes to our version.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>        1. You can expect to see three completely open worlds, each with ten fun and engaging levels and even one hidden level.</p>
<p>        2. Each world consists of one end-level-boss, which is created in part by you and us!</p>
<p>        3. Your actions have consequences, so whether you want a happy ending or a horrific one, that choice is yours!</p>
<p>        4. In total, there are nine secret levels which you'll need to uncover to discover valuable tools and information for your next quest.</p>
<p>        5. Users love choices, right? Well, you have the option of which characters to choose from – maybe you want to be Fox's lovely girlfriend?</p>

We are connoisseurs of retro video games, especially games from the Sega Mega Drive\Genesis. However, we want to see more quality, captivating games on the Sega Mega Drive\Genesis, so instead of only waiting and hoping, we are doing something about it!
 
We have been developing BioEvil for a year and a half now, and the process has grown on us and has become quite enjoyable!
 

 
Our team consists of three people. You can think of us like the ""Planeteers"" who combine our skills to create the mighty ""Captain Planet""! Okay, really, we are three experienced guys who are obsessed with retro gaming and what to share it with the world.
 

The game MineSweeper for SMD (2013)
The port of the game FlapyBird on SMD (2014)
The Chip8 emulator for SMD (2015)
And since 2017 he has been working on the game BioEvil.
      
         
                        
        
 
 

He began his ""creativity"" in 2017, taking part in the development of the game BioEvil.

<p>Sono veramente tante le associazioni degli appassionati al mondo dei rallies che organizzano numerosi eventi e competizioni che hanno come protagonisti i modellini radiocomandati. Esistono quasi dei veri e propri campionati paralleli a quelli ufficiali, nei quali si emulano in scala 1:10 le gesta e le gare dei grandi piloti che corrono nel WRC. E' un gioco che attualmente si pratica recandosi direttamente nei luoghi per lo più all'aperto, dove vengono allestite le varie tipologie di prove da affrontare, si vivono in questo modo delle belle giornate a pieno contatto di tante persone che condividono la stessa passione.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525680690/oa8qqnbysmmpzmtylefq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Le gare alle quali si partecipa risultano sicuramente divertenti ma presentano anche dei limiti, come ad esempio il fatto che sia necessario rincorrere i modellini a piedi nei tracciati e quindi di conseguenza averne una visione dall'esterno degli stessi che non è proprio ideale, normalmente nella realtà infatti si guida da seduti e si ha una visione sulla strada da percorrere dall'interno di un abitacolo. </p>
<p>Rally Game non sostituirà tali eventi che conserveranno sempre un loro spazio, ma apporterà tanti vantaggi interessanti, non sarà più necessario attendere che vengano organizzate delle gare da qualche parte e non ci si dovrà recare direttamente dove hanno luogo, ma soprattutto contribuirà a fornire un pò la sensazione di trovarsi a bordo vettura grazie alla camera che inquadrerà i percorsi di gara come se ci trovasse all'interno, le stesse immagini verranno trasmesse dalla rete sui grandi schermi delle smart Tv avveniristiche che ci ritroviamo oggi giorno in salotto.</p>

<p>Tutti i partecipanti alle prove cronometrate di Rally Game avranno a loro disposizione gli stessi mezzi, dotati delle migliori tecnologie e ritrovati di questo specifico settore per possedere pari opportunità nelle prove speciali che saranno cronometrate e registrate da un moderno sistema di cronometraggio affidabile e completamente automatizzato.</p>
<p><strong>La tecnologia</strong> </p>
<p>Oggi si può pilotare tranquillamente un piccolo drone amatoriale usando le reti di telefonia mobile 4G, figuriamoci quando arriveranno le super reti telefoniche di quinta generazione (5G) che dal 2020 ci daranno prestazioni adesso semplicemente inconcepibili, tra cui velocità dati di decine di megabit al secondo per decine di migliaia di utenti connessi contemporaneamente, e soprattutto un tempo di latenza molto ma molto inferiore a quello delle migliori reti LTE disponibili sul mercato.</p>

<p>La latenza di soli alcuni millisecondo significa che da qualsiasi parte del mondo è possibile pilotare un automodello ""drone"" ovunque si trovi, inviando i comandi da un device che opera su rete 4G per riceverne il video di ritorno dalla stessa rete per dirigere il mezzo e controllarne di conseguenza la migliore traiettoria possibile sul tracciato.</p>
<p>Il terreno individuato è coperto già da un forte segnale 4G che sarà reso più performante da alcune soluzioni tecnologiche posizionate nelle immediate vicinanze del campo da gioco per riuscire a migliorarne la stabilità e di conseguenza l'efficienza. Sarà possibile giocare e pilotare con una precisione adeguata avendo le garanzie necessarie per un controllo a distanza abbastanza efficace.</p>
<p><strong>I piccoli bolidi radiocomandati</strong></p>
<p>Gli automodelli in scala 1:10 saranno dotati di una camera hd con micro stabilizzatore, posizionata in modo da fornire una visione dei percorsi simile a quella che si avrebbe dall'interno dell'abitacolo di una vettura,  di un controller collegato ad una normale sim telefonica e integrato ad un radio controllo digitale d'ausilio per migliorare le performance di guida, motore elettrico, 4 ruote motrici e gomme da sterrato.

<p>Il campo da gioco si svilupperà su un terreno di oltre 5 ettari, sarà composto da 8 prove speciali con percorsi in fondo sterrato, lunghezze variabili dai 400 ai 700 metri e larghezza di carreggiata intorno ai 70 centimetri.</p>

<p>Verrà realizzato un percorso aggiuntivo di prova per testare i comandi a distanza, configurare le connessioni tra i più disparati device e prendere confidenza con il controllo online delle vetture. Completerà poi l'impianto un fantastico percorso che replicherà fedelmente in scala il famoso tracciato dell'Ittiri Arena, lo stesso dove si disputa la prova d'apertura del Rally Italia Sardegna nel campionato del mondo WRC.</p>

<p>Questo percorso in particolare sarà utilizzato per trofei di gare ad inseguimento con ""manche ad eliminazione diretta"". Un complesso sistema di cronometraggio di ultima generazione, installato lungo tutte le prove speciali, consentirà di prendere e registrare in modo molto preciso i tempi dei concorrenti per stilare i risultati. Durante le competizioni ufficiali gli addetti si occuperanno di riposizionare in carreggiata gli automodelli sino ad un massimo di 7 volte per gara, anche se a loro discrezione potranno sospendere le vetture che hanno subito grossi incidenti, quasi come a rispettare le competizioni reali e le stesse regole del mondo rallystico.</p>
<p>Nel campo da gioco saranno presenti anche delle camere esterne che riusciranno ad immortalare i passaggi più belli dei piccoli bolidi, alcune foto e video saranno trasmesse ai partecipanti tramite email quale ricordo dell'evento.</p>
<p><strong>Le competizioni</strong></p>
<p>Lo svolgimento delle gare sarà possibile grazie all'ausilio di un sito web di riferimento e alle applicazioni sviluppate ad hoc. Forniranno orari e dati per effettuare l'accesso alle piste e consentire la partecipazione alle gare in programma.

Seguiranno le prime fasi per il settaggio dei comandi e quelle di test sino a quando tutto sarà pronto per affrontare le prove speciali cronometrate. Gli addetti sul campo forniranno poi anche tutta l'assistenza tecnica lungo il percorso per eventuali problemi ai radio modelli e ci sarà poi una certa flessibilità per consentire di proseguire la gara anche con dei limitati fuori pista come quasi ad emulare la realtà. </p>
<p><strong>Semaforo verde e il play now</strong></p>
<p>Le gare con le prove speciali saranno in genere stabilite e decise anticipatamente con calendario e orari stabiliti, ma sulla home page del sito come pure sull'applicazione sarà presente un semaforo che quando apparirà di colore verde consentirà di giocare in real time con la possibilità di correre i rallies tra amici con prove cronometrate.

They apply to get to buy Noteboards for super-cheap, at almost no profit to me, and then resell them however they want and keep 100% of whatever they makes.Why? I don't like trying to convince people to buy stuff, but there are those that do. I help RGFT Entrepreneurs start mini-businesses by giving them some inventory for a really low cost, and in return I get some extra market exposure, some great user feedback, and the warm-fuzzies of having given someone a hand.


RGFT.net Designers are also ordinary people who've got an idea for some kind of invention that's so simple it should totally exist but for some reason doesn't. They'd love to turn their idea into reality, but they just don't have the money.If they let me develop and sell their invention for a year, I'll help them perfect the product, work out legal kinks, get them initial market exposure, and then turn the product back over to them at the end of the year if they wish.RGFT.net's only six months old and already there are several neat new products coming through the pipeline! I just need more of a budget to get them to production.

<p>Rhythm Destruction is in a unique position here on indiegogo where most game developers come here to fully fund their project we are mostly done and we just need help to finish the game.</p>
<p>Rhythm Destruction is a game like no other. It features intense rhythm based gameplay mixed with 'Shoot Em Up' inspired elements. To play, you manuever your ship while tapping timed key presses to the beat of the music to destroy your enemies. Rhythm Destruction tracks high scores across all game types and stages. It also features a scrolling feed to update you on whats happening around the community in real time in regards to new records, high scores and game news. The game also features a competitive challenge mode where users can go head to head on a specific song for bragging rights and more. Rack up enough wins and earn your spot on the challenge leaderboard, gaining worldwide recognition among your peers. We have big plans for this game mode in the future including tournaments with prizes and tiered leagues for non-stop competitive play.</p>
<p>We also have support for DLC to extend the life of our game well after launch. Some people argue that DLC is a way to hold back content that should have been there at launch. Well we fully intend to show everyone how DLC should be done. We are still trying to make sure our distribution partners will allow us to do this but <strong>we fully intend to give out all of our DLC FREE FOREVER to people who purchase the game on day 1 or donate at least 10 dollars here. People should be rewarded for being early adopters to games not punished</strong>.</p>
<p>Medals! We have around 100 medals for launch with ideas for plenty more. Most medals also unlock a special title to equip to your player profile. Up to four medals can be worn in your profile to show off your accomplishments to friends and foes. Let everyone know that you've beaten the hardest stage in the game without dying or that you've gotten a high score on the leaderboards.</p>
<p>*note* Since the trailer above was created we have redone lots of models/textures and upgraded the lighting system.</p>
<h1>The Music</h1>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rhythmdestruction.com/screenshots/2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We have an excellent lineup of music from <a href=""http://www.scirecordings.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.scirecordings.com/</a> which are the same guys that provided music to other rhythm games such as In The Groove, Pump It Up Pro, and more recently with ReRave.</p>
<h1>The Team</h1>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rhythmdestruction.com/screenshots/9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Rhythm Destruction is being developed by 2 people who love games. Ruu is in charge of programming and Sennin handles all the 2D/3D art as well as some music.</p>
<h1>The Goal</h1>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://rhythmdestruction.com/screenshots/10.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The reason we are doing this indiegogo is because we want to finish Rhythm Destruction and that is only going to happen if we take some unpaid leave from our full time jobs. We have families we have to support so the money raised here will allow us to take time off and focus on making the best game possible! Any extra funds raised over the goal will go towards licensing future DLC songs and advertising the game when it launches.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have HUGE plans for DLC post launch. Aside from just adding new music tracks and stages we have begun preliminary planning on adding a full on story mode. Other possibilities include adding in a league mode and online co-op play.

Overwhelmed with creative enthusiasm, he designed his first cube, with a simple apple in the centre.The journey from it's humble beginnings to today - where several different themes and skill levels of stuCube have been designed - has been one of fun and excitement in the French household, as we've shared our ideas and encouragement for this project.Our campaign is to raise $10,000 to fund a 3D printer and the first order of filament. This will allow us to produce the cubes, so you can get puzzling! What We Need & What You GetBreak it down for folks in more detail:Our first goal of $10,000 will provide us with a 3D printer and filament to produce the first edition (limited to 250) of stuCubes. These cubes will be of a kind, due to their unique serial number, indicating that you were one of the first crucial investors in stuCube.The StuCube will come in its own neat 3D printed box, that snuggly fits the cube inside. So once you've solved StuCube, you can pack it away, safe and sound until the next time you get puzzling! Our stretch goal of $50,000 will enable us to purchase more sophisticated modelling software, to develop an expanded range of stuCubes, and establish a website for private consumers. This website will enable users to purchase a range of stuCubes from our designed set, or contact us to arrange a quote for a personalised stuCube, based on their unique requirements. Our further stretch of $100,000 will enable us to effectively market the stuCube for commercial purposes. This includes all neccessary patents, copyrights and legal fees, development of packaging, and establishment of supply chain. It is our ultimate goal that children and adults all over the world can enjoy the stuCube challenge, and get puzzling!We will refund all contributions if we do not reach our goal of $10,000  The ImpactFor a friend, for a loved one, our 3D modelling options are endless, we can design a 3D puzzle of any difficulty, based on a theme or object you provide us.Imagine a stuCube created specially for your child, featuring their initials and their favourite objects, a soccer ball, an ice cream cone, and their teddy.Imagine a stuCube built using the name of your business, and set out in your waiting room for customers to amuse themselves.Imagine presenting your loved one a heart-shaped stuCube. At first, she looks confused, after all, it's just a puzzle, but as she pulls it apart, piece by piece, she reveals the centre, an engagement ring, and as that look of surprise crosses her face, you drop to one knee and say something cheezy like ""I'll give my heart to you, every day, if you'll just say 'yes' "".... okay maybe not, but you get the idea.Other Ways You Can HelpDo you have an idea for stuCube that we haven't presented here? Possibly a new theme, or extension of the concept?

<h3><strong>Update 08 July 2012</strong></h3>
<p><strong>I have released the first in a series of developer diaries! In this diary I talk about how  the core style of the environments you'll see in <em>Spectrum</em> was conceived. <a href=""http://arockcalledsteve.wordpress.com/2012/07/08/spectrum-developer-diary-mondrian/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Spectrum Developer Diary: Mondrian"">You can read it here</a>!</strong></p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>What is Spectrum?</strong></h2>
<p>Spectrum is a side scrolling shooter that uses the nature of colour in computing to provide structure for the levels and visual feedback to the player.</p>
<p>In computing, colour is handled by the number of bits available to the computing system. The earliest computers were limited to a single bit - it was either off or on, so black and white (depending on the available monitor) were the only available display options. As computing power increased, the number of available hues and shades also increased - first four, then sixteen, and so on. Today, computers use as standard a 24-bit system, allowing for 16.7 million colours.</p>
<p>In Spectrum, these systems, or ""palettes"", are used as a method to separate the levels, as you fight through your world  in order to return what was stolen: Colour itself. Each target is its own shade - though some may look similar - and the further into the game you reach the larger the pool of targets to destroy.</p>
<p>With an art style based on the works of Piet Mondrian, you as the player receive visual feedback from the world itself. Your health, your ammo count, and even your level progress is shown to you via how the environment -and you - change. The goal, ultimately, is to limit the interface to the target reticule itself.</p>
<p>As a player you will be fighting your way to complete each colour palette from the very first bit to the 16-bit system. As you fight, you will progress and evolve with the colour, working your way from the cellular level through to the high atmosphere.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>How will the money be spent?</strong></h2>
<p>After working on the design and early stages of Spectrum for the past few months alongside other (now complete) projects, it is my intention to go into full time production. What your money will allow me to do is cover the costs of living and some basics (such as setting up the website) that have currently been out of my financial reach.</p>
<p>By allowing me to go full time on the project, the quality of the product will be vastly improved, along with the speed of completion.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Where and when will you release?</strong></h2>
<p>The initial goal is to release the game on PC on various online distributors - primarily the Steam platform.</p>
<p>Depending on the success of Spectrum, it may be ported to Mac, phone and tablet systems. Whether this actually happens depends on the success of this pitch, and the success of the game itself.</p>
<p>There is no set release time for Spectrum. With the challenges of developing a game, I do not wish to place more undue stress on myself by setting a release date that if I miss will disappoint us all. It will be released when it's done, but the progress of development will be a public affair to all who show support. It will not be a silent process.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What do I get?</strong></h2>
<p>By showing your support, you'll have access to a newsletter detailing the progress of development.</p>
<p>By Pre-ordering Spectrum,  you get a digital, DRM-free PC copy of the game upon final release, along with also being signed up to the newsletter.</p>
<p>While the soundtrack is currently subject to large change from what you see in the video, if you throw in five bucks more you will also receive a full DRM-free copy of the soundtrack in FLAC.</p>
<p>Further perk points are still under consideration, including a hard copy of both the game and soundtrack.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update 23rd June</em></strong></p>
<p>Based on feedback from people interested, asking for this specific perk, anyone who donates $25 will be listed in the credits for Spectrum under a ""Special Thanks"" section<em>.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Update 27th June</em></strong></p>
<p>You asked for it you get it! Anyone who donates $50 or more will have their credit in anything A Rock Called Steve releases over the next two years - be it film, audio, or game related.</p>
<p>Those who have already donated $50 or more will be automatically bumped to this perk. Anyone who has donated less can bump themselves up by donating more if they wish!</p>
<p><em>Anyone who donated more than the perk they selected before higher perks were available will be bumped if they reached the next perk target.</em></p>
<h2><strong> </strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Who are you?</strong></h2>
<p>I'm a visual artist who has worked in film and animation for the past five years, and I intend to branch into the independent gaming market as a portion of my life experience. Having been an avid game player for almost two decades now, it has been a want of mine for some time. Now, my experience and training in art, animation and project management allows it to become a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Final Words</strong></h2>
<p>Thank you for spending the time to read this pitch, even if you decide not to show your support and fund the project. Despite having pitched ideas to big businessmen, TV executives and magazine editors, pitching to you  the general public - has filled me with more nerves than them all combined.</p>
<p>If you decide not to buy in, please at least share it! The more people who see this, the more likely this will succeed - so share, and share alike.</p>

<h2><strong>FAQ (Updated regularly):</strong></h2>
<p><strong>How is scoring worked out?</strong></p>
<p>Each level is scored based upon the percentage of targets killed in the stage. A fair comparison to the kind of result you expect would be the score system of the game <em>REZ </em>- Every kill counts to the percentage.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is colour more than a visual gimmick?</strong></p>
<p>Well, yes. The main point of the colour is to show your progress in a similar way to how a number will show your score in any number of arcade games. However, complimentary and clashing colours do have a benefit or punishment for the player and the enemies as the level progresses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What about the pacing?</strong></p>
<p>The alpha footage is slow. Very slow. I admit this, however it was a drawback of an early build - I struggled to get a recording at all, actually. The finished product will have a much quicker pace to the action, and it will challenge your co-ordination.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Linux?</strong></p>
<p>Most probably yes, but I cannot promise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Colourblind mode?</strong></p>
<p>I am weighing up whether this is viable, but considering I have the entire spectrum of colour at my disposal I should be able to include such a mode. The problem will be making sure that every stage of the game is viable for a colourblind player.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is colour purely aesthetic, or is there actually a point to things being different colours (and them coloring the background)?</strong></p>
<p>It is primarily aesthetic, however I am intending on including pickups that change the colour you are firing - your basic bullet is white, so multi-spectral, however if you pick up say an Orange pickup, for a limited amount of time your bullets will be Orange, so they will do more damage to Blue targets (which are complimentary colours to Orange) and less to Purple, which is the clashing colour.</p>
<p>Other clashing colour pairs include Blue and Red, Yellow and Pink, Sky Blue and Pink, and so on.</p>

<p>All the miniatures of the campaign are modelled and ready to be casted, so we only wait to obtain the necessary funding to make the resin casting. We have calculated that all the backers will receive their teams in June 2016.</p>

The Mighty Orks cheering song
Hello Fantasy Football fans!!! Here come The Mighty Orks, the hardest and succesful team ever!!! These greenskin killing machines are willing to jump to the pitch. Will you be the coach that lead them to victory?


The Mighty Orks is a new Spanish company that has come to bring you amazing Fantasy Football miniatures. We are a group of enthusiastic players and after a lot of years in the hobby we want to give the next step and start producing our own figures. So we need your help to make this a reality. Of course, we have chosen orks as our first team, because why to choose any other if you can choose orks?


We have the idea and we have the miniatures, but we need your help to release them and make The Mighty Orks team a reality.  All the greens are done, so as soon as we achive the goal and the campaign is funded we will be able to cast and ship the teams. We think that our funding goal is reasonable and we trust that the worldwide Fantasy Football players community will help us to achieve it.
All the miniatures will be casted in high quality resin. This material is lighter than metal and the finish is very good, so we obtain a full detail miniature and the low weight permits us to offer all the backers FREE WORLWIDE SHIPPING.













UPDATE: We have decided to unlock al the Stretch Goals, so now you get a full team composed of 16 players: 4 blitzers, 4 black orks, 4 linemen, 2 throwers, 1 goblin and 1 star player.


We start with a 12 players team but we have prepared a series of goals, and if we can reach them we will finish with a 16 players team, perfect for leagues or tournaments. And what happens if all the goals are achieved and the campaign keeps growing? Don't worry, we have more surprises planned for it!!! You can see bigger pics of the models in the Images Gallery from the campaign.

transform the environment, objects, and even the people around him to create
themed levels and worlds.  Ordinary
objects become weapons, armor, quest items, and even monsters to fight!  Tedious tasks become quests, and your
supervisor becomes a boss you fight to move up to the next floor.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438220307/s976vtrzalcdclnny8aa.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

</p><p>Dorkatorium Games is an independent video game studio in
Reno, Nevada comprised of Dan Bailey, Jake Leveroni, and Zack Cordisco.<span>  We all got started in the game industry
because we are hardcore gamers and want to spend our days creating the games
that we love to play.  We work hard to
stay true to our roots, and love hearing from other gamers, attending
conferences, and playing games as much as we can in our spare time.  Loyalty to the fans and quality games are
Dorkatorium’s #1 priorities, so we refuse to sacrifice our integrity.  All of our games are and will remain
original; no cookie-cutters here!  Every
idea we have is unique, and we will never rehash old ideas just to make a quick
buck.  </span></p>
<p>The team has a combined ten years’ experience in the video
game industry.<span>  Among us, we have shipped
almost 20 titles and have worked in both internal and third-party
development.  We have worked on titles
including <i>XCOM: Enemy Unknown, StarCraft
II, Grand Theft Auto III, Mini Motor Racing, Tap the Frog, Hollow Point,</i>
and more.</span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438218049/cclmjbuepbd4cjyhhug3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p>
</p><p>We are raising funds to finish our game, and get it out to
you!<span>  There are still art assets and
plenty of programming left to create, and our team needs to eat.  100% of the money raised will go directly to
making the game.  The more money we
raise, the better the game will look and the more content we can add.  If we raise enough, we can even hire more
people so that we can add even more content and still get the game out on time,
or even early!</span></p>
<p>Because integrity and fan loyalty are our #1 priorities, we
are self-publishing the game.<span>  This
allows us to make the game how we and our fans want it to be, without having
changes made by someone who is just looking at numbers and doesn’t care about
originality or integrity.  It also allows
us to stay connected to the fans, by getting the players involved in
development.  Backers can actually participate
in development, by contributing ideas and staying tuned in to the happenings
throughout the development process. 
However, that also means we have to pay for everything ourselves,
including feeding the team, computers, software, marketing, and all that fun
stuff.  We have already invested a lot of
our own money and we will continue to do so, but we would really love to get
folks involved so we can make the game as great as it really can be!</span></p>

</p><p>As we said, 100% of the money raised will go directly to
making the game, even if we raise more than our goal!<span>  If that happens, we will be able to add more
content to the game and even start working on expansions.  We have an initial list of stretch goals
below, but as the campaign goes on, we will add more perks and stretch goals as
each milestone is passed.  The more we
raise, the bigger the game gets.  It is
also important that we get the game out when we say we will, so even if the
campaign is a success and we add more content, the stretch goals take into
account the cost of adding more content while still releasing the game on time!</span></p>

</p><p>This is a low risk project, because we will be releasing the
game no matter what.<span>  We have already
invested our personal money to get things started, and should be able to finish
the game.  We are raising money so that
we can get the game done in a reasonable time, add all of the features the
players deserve to see, and make the game function and look tip-top!  Any money we raise will go to making the game
as great as it can be, as well as add new content to the game!</span></p>

<br/></div>","Lords of
the Water Cooler is a 2D adventure RPG, where players can play as two
customizable classes in a world created completely by the characters’
imagination.  The game is currently being
developed for iOS devices.


Players take the role of a typical office employee, bored to
death with his job.  As most of us have,
at one point or another, the character gets so bored he pretends he is in an
adventure RPG when he has to complete tasks at work.  He uses his imagination to literally
transform the environment, objects, and even the people around him to create
themed levels and worlds.  Ordinary
objects become weapons, armor, quest items, and even monsters to fight!  Tedious tasks become quests, and your
supervisor becomes a boss you fight to move up to the next floor.

Two playable classes, Warrior and Mage
Four “floors”, each with its own Challenge Arena, boss
room, and two large dungeon areas to explore, complete quests, kill enemies,
and do all of those great RPG things you love to do!
Customizable skills
Armor and Weapons that change in both appearance and
ability as your character levels up
Replay value – classes level up independently, so you
can play the game through multiple times with a new gameplay experience every
time.




Dorkatorium Games is an independent video game studio in
Reno, Nevada comprised of Dan Bailey, Jake Leveroni, and Zack Cordisco.  We all got started in the game industry
because we are hardcore gamers and want to spend our days creating the games
that we love to play.  We work hard to
stay true to our roots, and love hearing from other gamers, attending
conferences, and playing games as much as we can in our spare time.  Loyalty to the fans and quality games are
Dorkatorium’s #1 priorities, so we refuse to sacrifice our integrity.  All of our games are and will remain
original; no cookie-cutters here!  Every
idea we have is unique, and we will never rehash old ideas just to make a quick
buck.  
The team has a combined ten years’ experience in the video
game industry.  Among us, we have shipped
almost 20 titles and have worked in both internal and third-party
development.  We have worked on titles
including XCOM: Enemy Unknown, StarCraft
II, Grand Theft Auto III, Mini Motor Racing, Tap the Frog, Hollow Point,
and more.


We are raising funds to finish our game, and get it out to
you!  There are still art assets and
plenty of programming left to create, and our team needs to eat.  100% of the money raised will go directly to
making the game.  The more money we
raise, the better the game will look and the more content we can add.  If we raise enough, we can even hire more
people so that we can add even more content and still get the game out on time,
or even early!
Because integrity and fan loyalty are our #1 priorities, we
are self-publishing the game.  This
allows us to make the game how we and our fans want it to be, without having
changes made by someone who is just looking at numbers and doesn’t care about
originality or integrity.  It also allows
us to stay connected to the fans, by getting the players involved in
development.  Backers can actually participate
in development, by contributing ideas and staying tuned in to the happenings
throughout the development process. 
However, that also means we have to pay for everything ourselves,
including feeding the team, computers, software, marketing, and all that fun
stuff.  We have already invested a lot of
our own money and we will continue to do so, but we would really love to get
folks involved so we can make the game as great as it really can be!

As we said, 100% of the money raised will go directly to
making the game, even if we raise more than our goal!  If that happens, we will be able to add more
content to the game and even start working on expansions.  We have an initial list of stretch goals
below, but as the campaign goes on, we will add more perks and stretch goals as
each milestone is passed.  The more we
raise, the bigger the game gets.  It is
also important that we get the game out when we say we will, so even if the
campaign is a success and we add more content, the stretch goals take into
account the cost of adding more content while still releasing the game on time!

This is a low risk project, because we will be releasing the
game no matter what.  We have already
invested our personal money to get things started, and should be able to finish
the game.  We are raising money so that
we can get the game done in a reasonable time, add all of the features the
players deserve to see, and make the game function and look tip-top!  Any money we raise will go to making the game
as great as it can be, as well as add new content to the game!

Thanks for checking out our campaign!  We appreciate your time and any contributions
you made!  Please share this site with
your friends so we can make this game as epic as possible!

as <i>The Walking Dead</i>, <i>The Avengers</i>, <i>Dr. Who</i>, <i>Star

feeding their fandom through shops like we are proposing.  With the advent
of cyber and tabletop gaming and overall geek culture continuing to grow at an
exponential rate, easy and affordable access to a centralized place where you
can get these services is quickly becoming a necessity.

<p>I feel like this is something that not just geeks, but everyone in the southwest
Georgia region, as a community, could use for entertainment and socialization. This would save people money by
giving them a local place to go to instead of having to drive for hours to get
to anything entertaining. It would also give people an inclination to get out
of their houses and meet new people, as well as friends, in a place that is
both welcoming and comfortable. We want people to be able to socialize in a
place that isn't a social network but a network of fellow enthusiasts in a

<p><b>Is there a

<p>Yes. There are many people who are already members of different geek, gamer, and otaku related clubs at
the colleges and in the Albany area in general who would like to see a shop like ours take root and have a place to be able to have group functions at.
They are already driving hours away to shops in Tallahassee, FL and Dothan, AL. We would
be able to supply them with a place that is local and help keep our regional economy

We don't want to just give you the shop you need. We want to give you the shop that you deserve!  We don't want it to be bare-bones starting out! We want to be able to hit the ground at full speed and we need your help to make this the best geek, gamer, and otaku shop around!Funds from this Indiegogo campaign will go towards purchasing things like tables, chairs, display cases, wall decorations, licenses, gaming gear, and much more.Recently, we hosted Epicon, southwest Georgia's first geek convention. It was a huge success thanks to all of you who came out and joined us!  The next step is bringing you a shop that is a little piece of what you experienced there!  Xion will help us in turn make Epicon even bigger and better every year by giving  us a means to raise awareness and grow the geek culture in our area and at the same time bring in funds to support it year-round!Xion will be like a second home for most of the Albany area geek community and we want your help to make it the best it can possibly be from day one! This will be a shop for geeks, gamers, and otakus, by geeks, gamers, and otakus! Our mission is to provide the Southwest Georgia area with a
centralized hub for all things Geek, Gamer, and Otaku, such as:


Trading Card Games (Magic the
Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Pokemon)


Video Games (Call of Duty, Super Smash Brothers,
etc...)


Table Top Games (Dungeons &
Dragons, Warhammer, Shadow Run)


Anime and Manga

Cosplay Supplies
LARPing Supplies
Artisan made wares that you would normally only find at Conventions

Collectibles


And lots more!


Xion will also help to create new jobs and entertainment for
our area. 
As the popularity of movies and television shows such
as The Walking Dead, The Avengers, Dr. Who, Star
Trek, Star Wars, etc… continues to grow, people want to keep
feeding their fandom through shops like we are proposing.  With the advent
of cyber and tabletop gaming and overall geek culture continuing to grow at an
exponential rate, easy and affordable access to a centralized place where you
can get these services is quickly becoming a necessity.


We want to provide a place with activities
that are focused on community socialization and play in a comfortable place.
 People of all ages and backgrounds will come to enjoy the unique and
innovative environment that Xion will provide and will want to come back-- and
bring their friends with them!
We are not just creating repeat customers. Xion will
be growing a fan base of it's own.
We need your help in order to make this, a dream that is
shared by many, a reality! 
We are trying to reach a goal of $20,000.00.
This money will go towards:


Lease on Building

Licenses

Utilities


Interior and Exterior Improvements
like: signage, shelves, counters, displays, paint, decorum, seating, tables, TVs, games, etc...


That sounds like a lot of money, but it is not as much as
you would think! In order to create a place and experience like none
other, we will need it all if not more. 

We don't just want to be a novelty shop or game store that you
walk in and leave immediately after. We want you to have a place to be able to
relax and enjoy all the things that make you a fan of whatever fandom you
might like. Where you can do things like: 


Use the high-speed Wi-Fi internet
for free!


Watch the latest anime! 


Game with your friends around a
table or on a console without worry. 


A safe environment where
people can gather and have fun.


Events such as weekly tournaments and
contests with prizes.

Large in-store events and Mini Cons!
Earn rewards for repeat visitors and
event goers through our Members XP program where you gain experience points
(XP) and Level Up through your participation and purchases giving you
discounts, prizes, and access to special events! There will even be
Achievements to Unlock at Xion! 


Our Indiegogo supporter rewards will include:


Exclusive Indiegogo only swag from
XION!


Jump starts for Member Levels and XP!


In-store
discounts!


An exclusive XION Members Badge with Lanyard with your name on it!


Early Admission to our tournaments the day of grand opening!


Having your name immortalized on our store walls!


Always having a seat with your name on it available to you!


The opportunity to own a piece of XION itself through in-house stocks!



We want you to know that these XION memberships and
rewards will be well worth it. Here's how the XP system will work and
why it is a good idea to get these bonuses while you can by being one of our backers. 
Every time you attend an event or make a purchase in the store, you
will earn XP and will be able to level up after reaching a threshold. As you
level up you will get in-store exclusives like achievements, discounts,
freebies, admission to special events, drawings, tournament entries, and even
in-store credit. 

The level of backing that you choose in the rewards will also be the level that
you will start at when the shop opens, after the campaign is over everyone else
from that point on will start off as a Level 0 member. This is a chance to get a jump
start on earning future rewards once we open. I hope this will encourage you to
become a backer and help us create the paradise for geeks that we all want.





We will have a Wall of Fame in Xion that will include a
special permanent place exclusively to thank those who back us here! This will be dedicated to all of you who help make this paradise become a
reality.


We will also have special guests from across the
geek community at our Grand Opening.  Our first special guest will be announced after we reach the
$10,000 mark and we will continue to announce more at every $5,000 increment after that!



Stretch Goals!If we reach our goal for this Indiegogo, we will have further rewards for everyone. Our first stretch goal will hit just as soon as we break $20,000. The reward will be an in-store mini-con just in time for Halloween! We plan on having special guests, cosplay contests, gaming tournaments, food, and more! The best part is, this event will not cost anyone that comes a single dime! It will be a reward for everyone's hard work and efforts to help make Xion happen. Every single one of our backers will all receive something special at this event as well be recognized for their contributions!Stretch Goals$20,001 // An in-store Mini-Con for Halloween with free admission!$25,000 // ??????Unlocked once $20,001 is reached???????????$30,000 // ????? Unlocked once $25,000 is reached???????????The Impact on our Area
I feel like this is something that not just geeks, but everyone in the southwest
Georgia region, as a community, could use for entertainment and socialization. This would save people money by
giving them a local place to go to instead of having to drive for hours to get
to anything entertaining. It would also give people an inclination to get out
of their houses and meet new people, as well as friends, in a place that is
both welcoming and comfortable. We want people to be able to socialize in a
place that isn't a social network but a network of fellow enthusiasts in a
social environment!It would go beyond just entertainment.
We would also do charitable work in the region by having the
Xion's Cosplayers dress as everyone's favorite superheros
and visit children in local and regional hospitals bringing kids happiness
and hope and also appear at charity events giving back to the community. We will also be hosting charitable tournaments and events to raise funds for local charities as we did with Epicon!
The events and tournaments we host could also bring in many
out-of-town customers that could in turn equal additional customers and
clientele for surrounding businesses in the region.
The risks and challenges involved with starting Xion are:
Will there be
a demand for the services offered by Xion in the city of Albany or the
Southwest GA region?
Yes.  Without driving at the least an 2 hours, and into
another state, the services XION has to offers is not available anywhere else
in our region.
This photo shows a small section of locals that came to Epicon.Will the
popularity of the Geek culture continue to grow, or is it merely a fad? 
As long as comic books and movies are around, there will
always be someone looking to further their fandom. We want to be the ones
meeting that need.We are going to be fostering the growth of E-Sports, LARPing and Table Top competition with official tournaments and leagues that players can join. These will include both single player and team play. We will also be an Official Learning Hub site for anyone wanting to learn how to play any of the games that we are having tournaments for and teach new players how to advance in their skills and become competitive players. 
Is there a
client base already existing in the area?
Yes. There are many people who are already members of different geek, gamer, and otaku related clubs at
the colleges and in the Albany area in general who would like to see a shop like ours take root and have a place to be able to have group functions at.
They are already driving hours away to shops in Tallahassee, FL and Dothan, AL. We would

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Project Skylab 2 - Description</h3>
<p>Project Skylab 2 is going to make Algebra three-dimensional, engaging, and non-isolating. In the game, you are stranded on the surface of Mars due to a catastrophic accident. You will learn how to solve basic to advanced Algebra problems in your pursuit to escape Mars, but danger lurks around every corner. There is an army of cybernetic killer robots hunting for you. Your goal is to shut down the AI computer known as CAL(Cybernetic Assisted Learning) who controls this army of killer robots. You will have to use your arsenal of weapons to defeat CAL. You will also have your trusty rover to guide you across the red planet. The Mars landscape is 4x4 miles, so have fun exploring. The goal of the game is to create a comfortable, relaxing, and fun learning environment for students.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">About Different Game Studio</h3>
<p>My name is Justin Gedeon. I am a 21-year old college student from Murrieta, California who is passionate about changing education in the United States. I am the founder and president of Different Game Studio. I am a math, computer, and science geek who wants to get everyone excited about learning math. I love education! I built this company because I am tired of watching American students continue to score poorly in math. I believe some math teachers should not be teaching math as they overcomplicate the subject for students. I have had two horrible math teachers at the college level, one laughed at me for asking a question on a complicated topic, and the other taught directly from the book, which was extremely difficult. I’ve also had some incredible math professors, who have forever changed my life for the better. Math has been taught the same way for thousands of years, and it’s time for something new to be done. I want my video games to be there for the students who feel hopeless and don’t have a professor that believes in them. I think the cost of private tutoring is far too expensive, so I wanted to create an affordable alternative to help low-income families and even poor college students, who cannot afford private math tutoring. I want to help as many students as I can because I care about people. Anyone can learn anything with the right teacher and with just the right amount of encouragement. I have independently developed and have published two free-to-play educational math video games on the digital distribution platform known as Steam. Both games are in the early stages of development and are free-to-play.  Both games are rough drafts of what my vision for education should look like in the future. Project Skylab is focused around intermediate algebra, whereas Project Skylab 2 is focused around simple fundamental math concepts. All of my efforts are going towards the completion of Project Skylab 2, which is the game featured in this Indiegogo campaign. Understanding simple fundamental math concepts is so vital to understanding intermediate algebra.  This is why all my efforts are going towards Project Skylab 2. My games are nowhere near perfect, but they are lightyears ahead of my competitors. I read all of the user feedback because I genuinely care about building the best educational video game.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why an Indiegogo Campaign?</h3>
<p>Different Game Studio is dedicated to education through gamification. I, Justin Gedeon, am the sole developer and the only employee of Different Game Studio. I want to assemble a team of talented developers to help me complete the development of Project Skylab 2.  I am a self-taught game developer and a computer geek. I have reached the technical limits of what I can accomplish by myself. The framework for the game is already complete and ready to go for when new developers come on staff.  Project Skylab 2 is available now in Early Access on Steam, but it’s far from completion and is in the Alpha phase of development. Both of my games are functional proof of concepts that educational video games can and should be better. I can no longer sit idly by and watch kids continue to struggle in math.

<p>The funds raised from this campaign are going towards building a talented team to reconstruct Project Skylab 2 from the ground up for low-end computer hardware as well as consoles. This optimization challenge is a significant hurdle, but I believe we can overcome it. Maintaining a quality of excellence based upon user feedback is my most important priority. Implementing user feedback can sometimes lead to delays in production, but it’s crucial to building a better user experience. I view competition as my most significant risk, but I already have a big headstart on them. There are not that many educational game studios left in the world, and the ones that still exist, have very little to no market traction.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>User feedback is by far my greatest asset; you the player, by leaving just a single comment on my game can help me learn and improve upon my mistakes. I want to get people excited about learning math, and the only way that’s going to happen is by listening to players.

I am trying to make learning more fun, interactive, and more practical for the real world. And that's all there is to it.</p>

Project Skylab 2 - Description
Project Skylab 2 is going to make Algebra three-dimensional, engaging, and non-isolating. In the game, you are stranded on the surface of Mars due to a catastrophic accident. You will learn how to solve basic to advanced Algebra problems in your pursuit to escape Mars, but danger lurks around every corner. There is an army of cybernetic killer robots hunting for you. Your goal is to shut down the AI computer known as CAL(Cybernetic Assisted Learning) who controls this army of killer robots. You will have to use your arsenal of weapons to defeat CAL. You will also have your trusty rover to guide you across the red planet. The Mars landscape is 4x4 miles, so have fun exploring. The goal of the game is to create a comfortable, relaxing, and fun learning environment for students.
 
About Different Game Studio
My name is Justin Gedeon. I am a 21-year old college student from Murrieta, California who is passionate about changing education in the United States. I am the founder and president of Different Game Studio. I am a math, computer, and science geek who wants to get everyone excited about learning math. I love education! I built this company because I am tired of watching American students continue to score poorly in math. I believe some math teachers should not be teaching math as they overcomplicate the subject for students. I have had two horrible math teachers at the college level, one laughed at me for asking a question on a complicated topic, and the other taught directly from the book, which was extremely difficult. I’ve also had some incredible math professors, who have forever changed my life for the better. Math has been taught the same way for thousands of years, and it’s time for something new to be done. I want my video games to be there for the students who feel hopeless and don’t have a professor that believes in them. I think the cost of private tutoring is far too expensive, so I wanted to create an affordable alternative to help low-income families and even poor college students, who cannot afford private math tutoring. I want to help as many students as I can because I care about people. Anyone can learn anything with the right teacher and with just the right amount of encouragement. I have independently developed and have published two free-to-play educational math video games on the digital distribution platform known as Steam. Both games are in the early stages of development and are free-to-play.  Both games are rough drafts of what my vision for education should look like in the future. Project Skylab is focused around intermediate algebra, whereas Project Skylab 2 is focused around simple fundamental math concepts. All of my efforts are going towards the completion of Project Skylab 2, which is the game featured in this Indiegogo campaign. Understanding simple fundamental math concepts is so vital to understanding intermediate algebra.  This is why all my efforts are going towards Project Skylab 2. My games are nowhere near perfect, but they are lightyears ahead of my competitors. I read all of the user feedback because I genuinely care about building the best educational video game.

Why an Indiegogo Campaign?
Different Game Studio is dedicated to education through gamification. I, Justin Gedeon, am the sole developer and the only employee of Different Game Studio. I want to assemble a team of talented developers to help me complete the development of Project Skylab 2.  I am a self-taught game developer and a computer geek. I have reached the technical limits of what I can accomplish by myself. The framework for the game is already complete and ready to go for when new developers come on staff.  Project Skylab 2 is available now in Early Access on Steam, but it’s far from completion and is in the Alpha phase of development. Both of my games are functional proof of concepts that educational video games can and should be better. I can no longer sit idly by and watch kids continue to struggle in math. Learning any subject should always be fun and interactive. All of the funds raised from this campaign will go directly into the development of Project Skylab 2. The goal for the final game is to have 200-250 math equations with mini-lectures, online multiplayer, and be better optimized for console hardware. The funds will also go towards publishing the game on Xbox One. If you want to learn more about my vision for education through gamification, read the About Us page on my website linked below.

Cruel kings and queens are using this technology to make their castles strong.Now,they are after you and your people to make you, their slaves.Your objective is to save your people,build new castle,build the web,defend your castle and attack others.

When the game starts you will be provided with few people and a small place where you can build your dream castle.you start as a small leader(male/female) and can rise up to an emperor.
Build water lane from nearest river to castle.
To upgrade your castle you will attack other castles , take their resources and make them slaves.Buy attractive things from store to attract more people to join your kingdom.
Start agriculture and use your people to collect wood, stone, food, gold and gems.Store them for future use.
Collect taxes, build defense towers, train your people and prepare them for combat.
This game includes all the obvious things like upgrading army units,weapons,buildings,walls,castle towers,day and night cycle,weather system,inventory system, repairing system,quests,treasure hunts,character customization,rewards,acheivements,stats.
Hunt  fish and sea creatures, feed and grow them into larger beasts which helps protect the castle.
 
For every upgrade you get experience points.increase points, increase your level of leadership.
After you reach certain level, you can start building outposts.

In this game, you can hunt animals/creatures/monsters for food/battle/transportation.
The following are the three examples of hunting types in this game.
1.Traditional Hunting
Use archers to hunt for food.

2.Avatar Hunting
This hunting type is similar(not exact) to that of avatar movie ikrane scene.  
3.Mammoth Hunting
This hunting type is similar to that of 10000 b.c. movie mammoth scene.  
Your units can mount these creatures/monsters/animals and can be used in battle.
My plan is to make the environment more interactive, so that you can implement your own hunting strategy.

Buy engineers to start building the web around the castle.
A web consists of several circles.Each circle is made of several blocks.You can place anything on the block from defense towers to creatures.

Increase the number of  circles in the web to add more defense things.

As the web levitates above the ground,during battle you can use rotator(a type of monster which is shown below) to rotate the circle so that others may not enter.  
Upgrade the web to make it strong and rotate faster.upgrade your towers,army and beasts.
Engineers also build new defense towers and battle equipment,so make sure to upgrade them.

When the battle starts,the outermost circle of the web starts to rotate.  
To enter the web one must kill rotators to stop the rotation of the circle.it takes some time for others to kill the rotators,in the mean time you attack others using catapults, archers, wizards, dragons etc
If the rotators are killed and the rotation stops,then the next outermost circle starts to rotate.
Others enter the web with their army, siege towers and other battle equipment.
  
The following are the few examples of the battle in this game.


 

The following is inspired from 300 movie.  
Army units move through the web into the castle.
You need to kill the king/queen to gain victory.
After reaching certain level, you can attack larger castles and if you win you own that castle Web. 
Castles that are near to the rivers have higher value, so make sure to attack them.

This game includes battle formations.Just like combo attack which is mixture of several single attacks,you can create different formations of units and use that in battle.this takes the game to a new level.

Battles can also take place on battle grounds.game also has turn based strategy battle system used on battle grounds.

Jumpers are creatures with special abilities.they can jump from circle to circle on the web.they can even jump onto a rotating circle and attack rotators.if you upgrade jumpers,they will get the ability to carry other units from circle to circle.

Every unit in the castle web tries to protect the king/queen from enemies.some have less stamina and more combat skills and others have the opposite.
Protector is a creature/monster which has more stamina, skills, abilities than others.protector doesn't care about anything other than protecting you(leader/king/queen).

Hero's are similar to protectors.they have special skills and abilities just like protectors. 
Unlike protectors, they care about every other unit and you.

Boss is more powerful than protectors or hero's.you have to complete many tasks to own a boss.you can have several hero's or protectors but you can have only one boss for each castle web.boss doesn't care about anyone until and unless you are going to die.if you attack other castle webs, you need to kill the boss first and king/queen next to own that castle web.this takes the game to another new level.

Game will have Forest environment.so the models get redesigned based on the environment.



Local/Online.
Alliance.
Localization(most of the languages)
Rankings.
Messages.
Global Market.
Tournaments(gladiator type of games).

Two new environments(island and sky) will be added.
Island/Water environment will have aquatic characters like mermaids and aquatic creatures and monsters.
Island environment will be similar to this movie( how to train your dragon) island image.
 Source 
 
Sky environment means top of the mountain environment,touching the clouds.
Characters,creatures,monsters,animals and castle models are designed based on the environment.

<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Please, help us and share about Boowie &amp; Louie!</b></h1>
</div></div>","Boowie & Louie is a co-op 3D platformer game being developed by LudiSoft Studio. Inspired by games such as Toejam & Earl and Mario. The game features single player, multiplayer, 6 different worlds, magic boxes, 50+ leves to explore, and a lot more.




Bowie & Louie are two clumsy brothers living
with their grandpa in a peaceful village. Once in a calm day, a cute mysterious creature
mysteriously appears turning their lives upside down, making some rare items
magically disappear from their grandpa's antiques store and suddenly
""swallowing"" the brothers. At this point the adventure begins,
unexpected and akward enemies, amazing levels and a lot of tomatoes on the way. How
they got there? Where the mysterious creature came from? To find these answers,
they need to go deep in this adventure. In their favor (or not!) they have these mysterious magic boxes that may contain useful power ups, items or even some
unlucky surprises.



Inspired on the classic Toejam & Earl and
Mario games, Boowie & Louie is a funny 3D co-op platformer game with a
comical context making it perfect to enjoy playing with someone else, no matter
if with family or friends, and no matter how old you are.





6 Different worlds (Subject to increase): The game will feature 6 (or more) different worlds with its own main ""theme"".







More than 50 levels to explore (Subject to increase): There will be at least 8 levels per world.





Secret levels, paths and items: Be aware or you will certainly miss something secret on the way. Some of them easy to find, but some of them very hard.





Double the fun: Is there something better than a couch co-op?







Mutiplayer freedom: Co-op is cool, but sometimes it gets very frustrating if you want to go to one place and your partner to another but you need to stick together because of the camera. Go wherever you want!








Jump: Well, it's a platformer right?






Power-ups: Our heroes will need something to help them on their adventure. Nothing better than power-ups, they are very useful and you may need them to reach secret areas.




Challenges and Puzzles: Expect to face challenges or puzzles which may allow you to access secret places, hidden items or just to continue your adventure.




Magic Boxes: Oh yeah! Big surprises are waiting for you inside these boxes, better you be lucky.






Tomatoes: Tomatoes everywhere, for good or for bad!







Golden Eggs: You will need to find them in order to continue you progress in the game.


Money: You can buy magic boxes, tomatoes and other stuffs with these little golden pieces.



Bosses: These guys are tough, better prepare yourself before facing them and try to find out their weaknesses quickly.
And a lot more!

reward for only 20€! (see Infernal Items section below), includes:- 1 laminated board.- 48 tokens on laminated cardboard, double sided.- 12 peasants, cardboard, with their plastic bases.- 12 cards.- Rulebook, with 20 pages.- Game box.All components are printed in full color.“Infernis” is a project developed by:Fernando Lafuente. Game designer and author of different board games, like Essentia, Racing Dwarfs and Alerya.Vedra Games. A game publisher and organizer of gaming events. Creators of the wargame Colonial Space Wars.Saco de Huesos ediciones. Publisher with over 4 years of experience in book edition, as well as publisher of games linked to the world of literature (The  Labyrinth Collection).These partners are united to develop the present campaign, which has the objective of editing “Infernis”, a board game without dice that combines risk control, anticipation and strategy. With a duration of 30-60 min, in “Infernis” 2 to 4 players take the role of as many witches challenging each other in a cruel game of magic and cunning. Only the witch that manages to keep her unlucky peasants alive will win, preventing them from falling in the eternal flames that surround the cursed island of Infernis.To learn more about “Infernis”, visit this blog:http://gamerandcommander.blogspot.com.es/2014/03/infernis-introduccion-las-reglas-para.html“Infernis” has been presented previously as a prototype in national and international conventions, and enjoyed by gamers in different countries (Spain, France and Germany). Because of the interest generated and by popular demand, it has been decided to start a crowdfunding campaign with the objective of bringing this game to the community. Thanks to the contribution of potential backers during this campaign, we want to achieve the funding to publish a first edition of 1000 copies, which would give many game lovers worldwide access to this interesting and fun board game.This project is not only important because it will bring “Infernis to the community of players and provide them with hours of fun, but also because it offers new and unique rewards that will only be available during the campaign.The three parts involved in this project have edited products in their respective fields with success in the past.

For example, if the funding reached values between 6000€-10000€, it would unlock a bonus for the production of alternative boards, additional cards, components to use in new scenery… The first stretch goal will be announced during the campaign.The whole funding of the project must be provided by the backers, and no charges would be applied in case the minimum required was not reached.The Infernal Items are exclusive rewards you can select, up to a limit stablished by the Infernal Level you choose (See Infernal Levels).1.Infernal Donation (5€).

Diseñador del juego y autor de varios juegos de mesa ya publicados, como Essentia, Racing Dwarfs y Alerya.Vedra Games. Una editorial de juegos y organizadora de eventos lúdicos, creadores del wargame Colonial Space Wars.Saco de huesos ediciones. Editorial con experiencia en proyectos literarios (lleva más de cuatro años funcionando como empresa) y maquetación, así como en juegos relacionados con el mundo de la literatura (Línea Laberinto).Estas tres partes se unieron para desarrollar esta campaña, la cual tiene como objetivo la edición de “Infernis”, un juego de tablero sin dados que aúna control de riesgo, anticipación y estrategia. Con una duración aproximada de entre 30-60 minutos, en “Infernis” de 2 a 4 jugadores encarnan a varias brujas enzarzadas con sus rivales en un juego cruel de habilidad, magia y astucia. Vencerá quien sea capaz de mantener a sus infelices campesinos más tiempo sobre la isla maldita, evitando que éstos perezcan en las llamas eternas que la rodean.Para saber más sobre cómo se juega a “Infernis” puedes visitar el siguiente blog:http://gamerandcommander.blogspot.com.es/2014/03/infernis-introduccion-las-reglas-para.html“Infernis” ya ha sido previamente presentado como prototipo
en convenciones nacionales e internacionales, por lo que ha sido disfrutado por
jugadores de distintos países (España, Francia y Alemania). Debido al interés
que ha despertado y por demanda popular, se ha decidido acudir a esta
plataforma de crowdfunding con el objetivo de llevar el juego al mercado.
Gracias a la contribución de los potenciales colaboradores de esta campaña se
pretende lograr la financiación de una primera edición de 1000 unidades, 
con la que se espera poner al alcance de los amantes de los juegos de mesa de
todo el mundo este interesante y divertido juego.Este proyecto no sólo será
importante por hacer llegar “Infernis” a la comunidad de
jugadores y garantizarles muchas horas de diversión, sino porque ofrecerá
recompensas originales e irrepetibles que sólo podrán adquirirse durante la
campaña.
Las tres partes involucradas en este
proyecto han editado productos para el mercado en sus respectivas áreas con
éxito. Por este motivo su capacidad para gestionar profesionalmente un proyecto
de este tipo está garantizada, y la campaña será importante para reforzar
todavía más la confianza del público hacia ellos. 
El dinero recaudado servirá para
sufragar los gastos de producción del juego: físicos (imprenta, compra de
componentes, empaquetado), intangibles (derechos de autor del diseñador, derechos
de autor de la ilustradora, remuneración de los editores) y logísticos
(envíos). Calculamos que para 1000 unidades producidas de “Infernis”  necesitaremos 4500€, a lo que se suma 500€ en concepto
de comisiones para la plataforma y las empresas que gestionan las transacciones
económicas.
Los colaboradores tendrán a su
disposición una serie de recompensas exclusivas durante la campaña, las cuales
se plantean en forma de Material Infernal:Además de las recompensas está programado ofertar bonos para mejorar calidad de la edición y el número de componentes, los cuales podrían aplicarse a los mecenas si la financiación supera la cantidad mínima para realizar el proyecto. Por ejemplo, alcanzar cifras entre 6000€-10000€ permitiría “desbloquear” la producción de nuevos tableros, tarjetas adicionales, cartas para representar nuevos modos de juego, etc… El primer objetivo desbloqueable será anunciado durante la campaña.La financiación del proyecto deberá ser aportada íntegramente por la contribución de los patrones. En caso de no alcanzar el mínimo necesario no se hará ningún cargo a los colaboradores.

About PRiCERPG
You're not a hero, nor somebody special... this is a story about a regular dude, in a world full of instant gratification and strange events.
To reveal the secrets ""FarAF"", you have to grow emotionally along with our main character.
Or you can do the exact opposite and drown in your own pride and guilt... it is your choice.
While you do that... you can also:

Recruit a rat for your party!
Enter in a bench press competition!
Sell party members on the Black Market!
Win a lot of data in the Casino!
Go to the Tula Disco Building! where you can found a vaporweave zone, a weeaboo zone and a hardbass zone!
Go into space!
Escape from Social network sites and avoid procrastination!
Perform miracles at the church!
Kill a giant black widow!
Get killed by a giant black widow!
Get a giant black widow head!
Go fishing (wow!... really?)
Fly on a plane!
And much more!

 
About me
My name is Alex Zepeda, im from Chile and i have always been a fan of RPG games.
I have played Paper mario, Paper Mario TTYD, Undertale, Darkest Dungeon and Lisa, which is the game that inspired me to create my own game.
Everything in this game was developed by me, except the music and some art, actually im focusing on this project on most of my free time, also, this is me eating a stuffed sandwich.


Story
A random person, a nobody, someone who is nothing special, just by accident, an idea crossed his mind...
After he watched the news, for a brief moment, our main character, had doubt ... but that was enough...
Thanks to this, a  strange man named ""Tommy""  contacts with our MC and  after the message from Tommy, our weird adventure starts by trying to find this ""Contundito"" guy...
 
Characters
Our main character, a nobody. 
Sheddy, the new queen of the lands of FarAF. 
Contundito, the former king of the lands of FarAF. 
Van, son of Contundito.
Elmalo, a gay mercenary. 
Tommy, the strange guy from the computer.

Music

^^^ Click DJ Fank Duck to get the playlist on youtube! ^^^
**The completly sound track will be around ~ 80 songs**


The Fund
I will need around $7.500 US, where will the money go?

To my bloodstream! just the enough to survive while a focus myself on PRiCERPG
To the illustrator! my artistic skills aren't good enough to make detailed art for the game, so i will have to hire someone who can make it for me!
For the music! to make the music even better!
Translations and corrections!, my mother language is spanish, my english is really good, but im not a native english speaker, there will be a lot of grammatical errors that can be corrected.
Production costs, taxes and legal stuff!
Leftovers will be used to make the world of PRiCERPG even better! 

Goal Reach
What if the goal isn't reached?
The project will be finished regardless, but it will take much more time, but thats about it.

Risks
The most significant risk is the game being too edgy with the humour and too edgy with the game in general.
Im really aware of this, so im usually taking advice and considering them a lot.
But i also try to give as much as posible of my own personality into the game, because i really don't want PRiCERPG to become just another dull game nor a copy.

Challenges
My biggest challenge will be marketing and making the pople to get to know about this game.
Im not a super-star from the internet nor anything like that... im just a regular dude with a lot pasion, work ethics and love for this project.
And, because of the nature of PRiCERPG, that could be double edge blade... but im positive about this project and at last, i promise you that this game has A LOT of work and love into it.

<li>The <strong>Nostalgia Knight</strong>: Also known as the <i>Knight of the Past</i>, he is the main protagonist of the game, as well as the player's avatar. No word will get out of his mouth, but he will react in consequence to the events around him.</li>
<li>The <strong>Lord of Progress</strong>: Main antagonist of the game, he wishes for the <i>World</i> to advance to the next stage, after many years of standstill. His motivations are unclear, but one thing is sure: he is driven by the sight of a brand new world.</li>
<li>
<strong>King Kilobyte</strong>: Wise king of the <i>Kilobyte Kingdom</i> and direct superior of the <i>Nostalgia Knight</i>, he wishes for the well-being of his subjects as well as the territory he has under control. He will directly help the Knight by upgrading his arsenal whenever he can.</li>

<strong>Princess Kilobyte</strong>: Daughter of the<i> King Kilobyte</i>, she wished to engage a peace talk with the<i> Lord of Progress</i> before resorting to the Knight's help. However, no sign of life were shwon from her after her departure. Thus, the <i>Nostalgia Knight</i>'s mission has been extended to saving her.</li>
</ul><p>Aside from the main cast, the Nostalgia Knight will encounter diverse enemies throughout his adventure:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Crash</strong>: Inhabitant of the Kilobyte Kingdom who decided to serve under the Lord of Progress. As its name suggests, needlessly crashes onto walls or fall into void.</li>
<li>
<strong>Crashe</strong>: Female variants of Crash, Crashe tend to avoid falling into pits. Besides, they also spit small junk balls when they see an intruder coming towards them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Float</strong>: Usually inoffensive, they decided to rally themselves to the Lord of Progress... but for now, they just enjoy flying around.</li>
<li>
<strong>Soft Lock</strong>: One of the Lord of Progress' most trusted minions. Anyone trying to harm it will have to follow a certain protocol dictated by the chest itself.</li>
<li>
<strong>Laughing Gas</strong>: Acts as a defense system for Soft Lock. They ram into the intruders until they die.</li>

<li>The <strong>Freezer</strong>: freezes an enemy in space for a short period of time before killing it.</li>
<li>The<strong> Grabber</strong>: grabs a tile and allows you to close your distance with it; deals damage if used on enemies.</li>
<li>The <strong>Burner</strong>: throws a bomb, does great damage.</li>
<li>The <strong>Glass Cannon</strong>: destroys everything in sight, but be careful not to get hit while wielding it...</li>

Help the Nostalgia Knight in his quest to defeat the Lord of Progress before the latter reshapes the world to his liking and chaos arises.With your help in funding this campaign, we will be able to finish a proper demo (or even the full game, as a stretch goal.) The demo is planned to feature:

10 Levels (showcasing the first out of many worlds.)

2 different weapons: the Ancient Sword and the Freezer.


1 Boss battle with its own settings.

1 HUB room for weapon upgrading.
A World Map.

1 Save slot.
Secrets...
While the entire game will include:

100+ Levels (in at least ten different worlds.)

6 different weapons for a polyvalent exploration system.

10+ Boss battles with their own settings.

3 HUB rooms for weapon upgrading and secrets purchase.
A World Map.

3 Save slots.
More secrets...
 This adventure features four main characters:
The Nostalgia Knight: Also known as the Knight of the Past, he is the main protagonist of the game, as well as the player's avatar. No word will get out of his mouth, but he will react in consequence to the events around him.
The Lord of Progress: Main antagonist of the game, he wishes for the World to advance to the next stage, after many years of standstill. His motivations are unclear, but one thing is sure: he is driven by the sight of a brand new world.

King Kilobyte: Wise king of the Kilobyte Kingdom and direct superior of the Nostalgia Knight, he wishes for the well-being of his subjects as well as the territory he has under control. He will directly help the Knight by upgrading his arsenal whenever he can.

Princess Kilobyte: Daughter of the King Kilobyte, she wished to engage a peace talk with the Lord of Progress before resorting to the Knight's help. However, no sign of life were shwon from her after her departure. Thus, the Nostalgia Knight's mission has been extended to saving her.
Aside from the main cast, the Nostalgia Knight will encounter diverse enemies throughout his adventure:

Crash: Inhabitant of the Kilobyte Kingdom who decided to serve under the Lord of Progress. As its name suggests, needlessly crashes onto walls or fall into void.

Crashe: Female variants of Crash, Crashe tend to avoid falling into pits. Besides, they also spit small junk balls when they see an intruder coming towards them.

Float: Usually inoffensive, they decided to rally themselves to the Lord of Progress... but for now, they just enjoy flying around.

Soft Lock: One of the Lord of Progress' most trusted minions. Anyone trying to harm it will have to follow a certain protocol dictated by the chest itself.

Laughing Gas: Acts as a defense system for Soft Lock. They ram into the intruders until they die.
 Throughout his adventure, the Knight will acquire new weapons which will help you against powerful foes:
The Ancient Sword: base melee weapon, does average damage.
The Booters: allows you to dash across a short distance, dashing through vulnerable enemies.
The Freezer: freezes an enemy in space for a short period of time before killing it.
The Grabber: grabs a tile and allows you to close your distance with it; deals damage if used on enemies.
The Burner: throws a bomb, does great damage.
The Glass Cannon: destroys everything in sight, but be careful not to get hit while wielding it...
Not only that, an upgrade system will be available for making the game an easier experience to casual players.Of course, you can also decide to stick with only the jumping ability and/or a V1 Ancient Sword, a challenge which would surely please hardcore gamers. By exploring the levels thoroughly, you will surely find secrets. Be they Pixel Pieces, codes, messages, references or whatever; have fun looking for them all.Oh, a Pixel Piece! Of course, you will be given rewards for your contribution:Thank you very much for supporting Nostalgia Knight! You will get your name in the credits as well as a high-resolution Box Art of the game (2048x2048 pixels.)You shall receive a link to the playable demo three days before its official release. As for the full game, you will have the chance to download it one week before its official release.Add to the previous tier a digital release of the OST so you can listen to it when you play Super Mario Bros.Ever felt nostalgic of the old physical guidebooks? Rejoice! One will be made for Nostalgia Knight (albeit digitally, for this tier.)If you can't choose between the music and the book, why not both?Want to have total control over the game? We'll include an USB NES controller to the pack so you can play with yer olde Nintendo controls.Sadly, we cannot use a real cartridge as all the data wouldn't fit on the GameBoy system. However, a replica would still allow the player to feel they own a GB game.WARNING! THIS TIER IS ONLY SIGNIFICANT IF STRETCH GOALS ARE REACHED!If stretch goals are reached, we will release physical copies of the guidebook with extra pages (developer words, extra tips/cheats, etc...)What about leaving your own print on the game? For this tier, you may leave any secret/easter egg/unlockable (as long as it doesn't interfere with gameplay.)You might want to play the game even earlier than one week before its release. If you do, you can always become a beta tester for Nostalgia Knight. If leaving your print doesn't seem enough for you, fret not! With this tier, you will be able to create your own enemy (anything is welcome to be suggested, so don't be afraid.)Still not enough? Then, how about you create your own boss? This is the least we can do for this much of a contribution. As initially mentioned, this campaign has for first goal to fund the game's demo, which means you will see several stretch goals, such as the game being fully funded.Every stretch goal will also unlock more slots for physical guidebooks and fake cartridges.If we reach this €5000 stretch goal, we will officially have enough to fund the full game with a safe enough net. Fake cartridges and physical guidebooks will be created, 50 of each.If we reach €10000, we will add more songs to the list (such as one per boss, and/or alternate themes.) As for the fake cartridges and physical guidebooks, their production will be increased to 100 of each. Our musician will take care of everything regarding sound, from the OST to the SFX (sound effects.)Eadgear works on realizing and bettering every graphical asset. He doesn't only do pixel art, but also has quite a bit to show on his DeviantArt page. We've worked together in the past, and been doing pretty well together.Dorian Delord (hey, it's me!), working on everything else: game and level design, programming, as well as bringing all the theoritical elements to the other team members so they may have less trouble working on that mess. I started to make games for a couple years by passion, but rarely ever got to finish projects.If you have any questions to ask the team, feel free to post them on the game's Twitter page. We have been working for months on Nostalgia Knight, but there came the point where I couldn't pay for any more assets.With the sum gotten from this campaign, we hope to cover all of the major upfront costs that would allow us to pay for the game's graphics and sound work.We are also taking account of Indiegogo taking a share of the raised money, as well as applying the game to Steam and such, allowing for the game to reach a broader audience.The remaining funds will serve as a safety extra to make sure we don't fall short on money for assets. Unsurprisingly, backing this project also comes with risks.The biggest one of them would be to get the physical rewards in time. However, I can guarantee the arrival of every digital backer reward in time, should the game be fully funded.There's also the risk of one of our members getting sick or injured, slowing the project down a bit.The August date sounds pretty close, but the game should be done by then (or at least would the beta tests stade begin.) If anything happens in that regard, you will be warned first thing. If you want to contribute to this funding, whether you have money or not, please spread the word; it's free and only takes a few seconds!Badge by Crowdfunding Community.",28.0,0,"1 Campaign

Note, this is 3d game in which you always draw some things before the others. Additionally you have to draw this cubic battlefield. I think it is difficult to make it better. As for other features.

<p> </p></div>","What is WarpDrive3d?
WarpDrive3d is a first person shooter game that puts you in the midst of a space battle. It is also a fun way to learn about astronomy, especially our solar system.
 
The Story
Megaevil Corp. discovered a new Earth like planet with your help as a deep sapce scout. You quit working for them when you discovered their insidious designs of plundering and polluting the new planet.But you can't just quit Megaevil Corp. They want to silence you for good. Now a renegade, you decide to stop their evil scheme.
You must sail your space ship and not only survive the relentless onslaught of photon bombs and torpedoes, but also destroy enemy ships and the mothership in orbit.It only gets more challenging as you realize you have to replenish your ammunition, oxygen and fuel, and the refueling stations are guarded by surface to air missiles batteries.Explore the planets and moons, fly around asteroids in this 3d space simulation game in your struggle to stop Megaevil Corp.
Educational Tool
Reading about the solar system, looking at pictures of Jupiter, or the Orion constellation, the M17 or the Eagle nebulae is one thing, but to actually sail through space in a simulation is a totally different experience.

The game uses texture maps from NASA.gov of real planets and moons in our solar system to create the objects in the game. 
You will be able to identify the planets in our solar system, their moons, and also some of the landmarks on these planets, like Olympus Mons volcano and Valles Marineris canyons on Mars, the Red Spot on Jupiter.

You will sail around Earth's moon, identify Aitken crater basin, Imbrium crater, and other landmarks.
We are very excited about adding new levels that will allow you to explore not just our solar system, but also other star systems and complete missions there.
You will be learning about pulsars, black holes, and comets in an exciting way.
Who are We?
WarpDrive3d was started by Oosman and LeLe. Between the two of us, we have many years of experience in computer programming and software designing.
 Oosman has developed software for phones, embedded devices, and tractors/combine harvestors that aid driverless operations. He also developed children's PC games as language learning aids.
LeLe is a user experience specialist and has designed man-machine interfaces, websites and apps.
Why this game?
We thought it would be challenging to create an action game that is eductional, addictive and fun to play. 
So we built the game engine, the physics engine, and now we are adding more levels and completing the story line of the game. 
We want to indulge the players into learning astronomy in a fun way. 
 
What We Need & What You Get
We want to deliver the game with:

Multiple levels of increasing difficulty
An array of new weapons
More space ship designs
Improved graphics
Multi-player support, play against your friends
 

 
The funds we get will be used for the development cost of the game, creating advanced 3d models, improving graphics, and optimizing the game engine. 
We have used our resources and time to come this far, your funds will help us launch the finished game.
Schedule
After we get the funding, we estimate 3 months time before we can release the beta version of the game with all the levels. 
The full game is expected to be released after 6 months from date we get the funds.
All the funders will get regular updates on our Indiegogo pages about our progress.
Stretch goal
We want to bring WarpDrive3D to the tablet, so you can play it on your iOS or Android devices.
Spread the Word...
Tell your friends and family about WarpDrive3d game. Feel free to ask us any questions you have about this project. 
Your support and feedback will give us a big boost.

<p>Ira was the only son of a poor farming family, born to a divided society with little to stand on. He was destined to grow up to join his father in the Martian mines, and his ambitions to explore the stars were a distant, lofty dream.</p>
<p>As a child he watched humanity undertake their greatest endeavor, the Holocene project, as it departed from the Solar System to a new star; a place completely unfamiliar and impossibly distant.

<p>But Ira does travel to this star.

The sound of that signal was something Ira knew as a boy, like a voice calling out to him across the void. He is deeply shaken and his memories are blurred, returning in flashes, shedding light on his murky past. Struggling to survive, Ira is cutoff and unable to return home. He travels through the Lithic System aboard the desolate, damaged Holocene II in search of rescue, answers, and above all, hope.</p>

<p>Music will act as a guide as you navigate Ira’s world. Within Ira’s alternative history arises the folk music of those far from home in Martian mines, and the plight of a people left behind by the space faring few. This music will play the interludes of the story, carrying you across the various timelines in surreal transitions across time and space. Inspired by Appalachian mountain music and the blues of the Mississippi delta region, the soundtrack of early rural America is turned on its head when given a surreal treatment. Deep, airy ambiance fills the space between pensive banjo notes, mandolin chords echo into oblivion. The result is a feeling that connects the farms of Earth and the vast expanse of space, a feeling that is alien, yet familiar.</p>

A child reaches for the stars, burdened by circumstance. Folks chained by debt, indentured to the powers at large. Follow along through this alternate 1930's where mankind is thrust to the stars in this journey from backwater slums across the void of space and time.



Ira was the only son of a poor farming family, born to a divided society with little to stand on. He was destined to grow up to join his father in the Martian mines, and his ambitions to explore the stars were a distant, lofty dream.

<p><b>Hitting Our Target.</b> In case you're new to Indiegogo, our campaign works on an all-or-nothing basis. That means we have until December 4th to meet our goal of $39,000. So, if Wednesday the 4th comes and we are only at $38,999 ($1 short of the goal) the project dies. We won't be able to move forward, you won't receive your soon-to-be coveted Zombie Apocalypse Control Kit or be the envy of all your foam dart friends, your money will be returned, and we will all be left with just our dreams (oh and a $15,000 mold for a paper weight). </p>

<p><b>Riding Shotgun.</b> We're not asking for a handout. We want you to be a part of the project! Take a look at the pictures and videos. If you think these guns are as awesome as we do, you can help bring them out of hiding and into production by purchasing one, two, or six :) of them and help us meet our factory minimums. If you like the project but don't feel the need for a gun, there are other fun perks for being a supporter. </p>
<p><b>Pulling Out the Big Guns. </b>This whole project started because we love to play as a family, especially stuff that get us up and moving and away from electronics. So for Christmas a few years ago, we bought some Nerf guns. Our kids loved the concept, but the performance was so disappointing that we created our own guns. Our patent pending design increased the range, speed, and accuracy. Better yet, we got rid of all the springs, gears, and levers that complicate the gun and break easily. Our guns really ""blew"" away the competition! As we played with neighbors and friends, it only took a round or two for them to put down their gun and come looking for any extras we had. We checked into mass production, but it was $15,000 just for the mold! That made it a little unrealistic for us to produce the guns for Christmas, birthday gifts, and neighborhood games. That's where you come in.</p>
<p><b>Get Fired Up! </b>Like we said before, there are lots of fun ways to support the project. You can choose from buying the iTunes hit single ""Shootin' in the Dark,"" to stickers, a t-shirt, or a Zombie Apocalypse Control Kit featuring the only gun really capable of making the head shot necessary to take out a Zombie. </p>

<p></p>
<p>What if you hate Zombies? No problem, there are a million other games you can play with this high performance shooter, limited only by your imagination.</p>
<p>We Won't Blow It (your money, that is). We will use 100% of the pledge amount combined with our own funds, for the mold and to meet the minimum order quantities.</p>
<p><b>Show Me Your Guns. </b>We built a few prototypes and have a patent pending on the very best one.

<h4>Risks and challenges</h4>
<p>Pulling the Trigger  The biggest risk for us on the project was deciding to go for it and produce the mold! We knew we would have to come up with funds for that before we could launch our campaign, and it was a little scary to make the first move. But we have had so much fun with the guns, we decided to jump in with both barrels.</p>
<p>We secured a supplier who has a great working relationship with the factory that is building the mold and producing the guns. If needed, our supplier also has secondary sources.</p>
<p>After the project funds, we'll be having a giant fulfillment party, hiring our children to do menial labor which will help them with funds AND motivation for their future education ;). We also have a fulfillment company standing by in case we are not able to handle everything in a timely way from the home base.</p>
<p>We promise not to leave you ""Shooting in the Dark.""  We'll be communicating all along the way. We'll tell you how production is coming and when we expect the shipment to arrive. We'll also post pictures of our late night fulfillment parties, and comments from satisfied customers (that's you!)</p>
<br/><p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Thanks to everyone for your great support & enthusiasm! This campaign is over, but because of you, we're moving forward and you can order guns here:

AirForce BlowGuns™


AirForce BlowGuns™ may be the most effective foam dart guns ever made! Can shoot 100 feet, are ridiculously fast & intensely accurate.








Check out the speed measured at Jake's Archery!
Hitting Our Target. In case you're new to Indiegogo, our campaign works on an all-or-nothing basis. That means we have until December 4th to meet our goal of $39,000. So, if Wednesday the 4th comes and we are only at $38,999 ($1 short of the goal) the project dies. We won't be able to move forward, you won't receive your soon-to-be coveted Zombie Apocalypse Control Kit or be the envy of all your foam dart friends, your money will be returned, and we will all be left with just our dreams (oh and a $15,000 mold for a paper weight). 



Riding Shotgun. We're not asking for a handout. We want you to be a part of the project! Take a look at the pictures and videos. If you think these guns are as awesome as we do, you can help bring them out of hiding and into production by purchasing one, two, or six :) of them and help us meet our factory minimums. If you like the project but don't feel the need for a gun, there are other fun perks for being a supporter. 
Pulling Out the Big Guns. This whole project started because we love to play as a family, especially stuff that get us up and moving and away from electronics. So for Christmas a few years ago, we bought some Nerf guns. Our kids loved the concept, but the performance was so disappointing that we created our own guns. Our patent pending design increased the range, speed, and accuracy. Better yet, we got rid of all the springs, gears, and levers that complicate the gun and break easily. Our guns really ""blew"" away the competition! As we played with neighbors and friends, it only took a round or two for them to put down their gun and come looking for any extras we had. We checked into mass production, but it was $15,000 just for the mold! That made it a little unrealistic for us to produce the guns for Christmas, birthday gifts, and neighborhood games. That's where you come in.
Get Fired Up! Like we said before, there are lots of fun ways to support the project. You can choose from buying the iTunes hit single ""Shootin' in the Dark,"" to stickers, a t-shirt, or a Zombie Apocalypse Control Kit featuring the only gun really capable of making the head shot necessary to take out a Zombie. 




What if you hate Zombies? No problem, there are a million other games you can play with this high performance shooter, limited only by your imagination.
We Won't Blow It (your money, that is). We will use 100% of the pledge amount combined with our own funds, for the mold and to meet the minimum order quantities.
Show Me Your Guns. We built a few prototypes and have a patent pending on the very best one. After some rigorous testing by friends and relatives, we sent the drawings and prototype to the factory to create a mold. The guns will be produced from ABS plastic (the eco friendly kind) and look similar to the guns used in our videos. 
Darts. We tested a lot of different darts, and have included the one that performed the best. You can also shoot Nerf N-Strike darts in our guns, but we think you'll be much happier with the performance of our darts (and our gun). 

Setting our Sights. Here is the timeline we are working from to make sure we deliver on target.
October: Factory produces mold from drawings. 
November: Mold is finished, testing and tweaks completed. 
December: Final mold approved. Production of guns begins.
January: Guns are shipped. You amaze your friends with the power and accuracy of your new foam dart gun, enjoy interactive play with friends and family, and the tide turns in favor of the humans in Human vs. Zombie games at colleges across the nation.

<p>Please note that this is not a collectable card game to sell random card packs.  The game comes with sufficient cards to play the campaign.  Each expansion to the game comes with a fixed set of new cards along with new 3D models and animations that adds more variety and flavor oriented around certain themes, quests, or locations, like board game expansions.</p>

Death Becomes All comes with procedural generators for villages, towns, people, zombies, and even an open world campaign with multiple endings. A rich new fantasy setting is procedurally generated for every new game.


Below is a 1 minute video of randomly generated villages in the game.  This is work in progress, with more building varieties coming, including special purpose buildings like inns, taverns, forges, temples, etc.  Towns, ruins, caverns, and other quest locations will also be randomly generated in the game.


Much of the flavor and variety of tactical combat comes from the card-based character development system.  Ability cards are a fun way to provide a rich variety of interactions with both the strategic open world game play and the tactical turn-based combat. 

Please note that this is not a collectable card game to sell random card packs.  The game comes with sufficient cards to play the campaign.  Each expansion to the game comes with a fixed set of new cards along with new 3D models and animations that adds more variety and flavor oriented around certain themes, quests, or locations, like board game expansions.


Zombies are not the only threat.  The realm is inhabited by other fantasy monstrosities, living and undead, that jealously guard their treasures and secrets.


Bands of the living roam the cursed land, each to its own purpose.  Are they friend or foe?


Build sustainable sanctuaries to house characters and store supplies.  Assign tasks like healing and crafting to various characters in your sanctuary to further your goals.  Talk to rescued villagers to gather information about the world and plan your next move on the campaign map.


Every new game takes place on a randomly generated campaign map with towns, villages, ruins, temples, forges, castles, caverns, and other adventure areas. Characters choose their own path through the world, discovering places and lore that reveal several different endings from which they can choose to pursue.

Heroes are characters with extraordinary abilities and hard-to-get equipment who can be recruited during each campaign.  Each hero has a personal quest.  Completing the quest will make the hero available as a starting character in all future games.  Hero of the Realm backers will receive the following exclusive heroes.







Hero of the Realm backers will get the following rare or better gear for your extra support of this campaign.



The Digital Strategy Guide is included with the Hero of the Realm package.  It provides helpful hints and strategies for all facets of game play, from the open world strategic campaign to the turn-based tactical combat to character development.  In addition, this guide will include stories and backgrounds on the various characters, factions and monsters in the game along with a full inventory of all ability cards shipped with the game and a plethora of full color artworks.

Beyond benefits though, if a game isn't fun what's the point? <strong><em>So our team of a PhD neuroscientist, a board certified behavioral analyst with PhD (autism/ADHD) and game developers</em></strong> built in an equal amount of fun, making the game as exciting as other games kids already play. </p><p>The top <em><strong>comments from other moms</strong></em> when they learn of our game are, ""It's about time!"" and ""I wish this game had been available when my child was younger.""</p><p><strong><em>How else can you improve you child's attention and planning for $20?</em> </strong>While our $20 perk lets you pre-purchase our game, other brain training games for ADHD cost $1,000 to $2000 plus fees of hundreds of dollars per hour since games can only be played in-office.

Players study specs on available car parts and characters, plan which parts and characters to select, compete for car parts, build and race their car (players control acceleration and braking). Players compete against 3 computer-run non-player characters (NPC) teams while sticking to their time limit and avoiding distractors like our Trickster. Skill is shown on the dashboard, which gives scores determined with propriety methods for calculating player responses for attention, strategy, recall and time per game plus allows the player to compare their recent score to their average score.

Beyond benefits though, if a game isn't fun what's the point? So our team of a PhD neuroscientist, a board certified behavioral analyst with PhD (autism/ADHD) and game developers built in an equal amount of fun, making the game as exciting as other games kids already play. The top comments from other moms when they learn of our game are, ""It's about time!"" and ""I wish this game had been available when my child was younger.""How else can you improve you child's attention and planning for $20? While our $20 perk lets you pre-purchase our game, other brain training games for ADHD cost $1,000 to $2000 plus fees of hundreds of dollars per hour since games can only be played in-office. While we are a tiny startup working hard to get our first product out to you, we believe we are startup with a conscience and a mission to make the world a better place.

<h3>The first offering from indie publisher Oz Kids Games, Cutthroat Pass is an exciting pirate-themed family card game in the tradition of Uno, Gubs and rat-a-tat CAT.</h3>
<h3><img alt=""Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/857890/pictures/full/20130607210749-Facebook_1_.png?1370664475"" src="""" style="""" title=""Our Facebook and Supanova Expo Banner""/></h3>
<h2>So What Makes This Game So Special?</h2>
<h3>Easy to learn and fun to play, Cutthroat Pass is the ideal game to play with family or friends. </h3>
<p>As a parent, primary school teacher and avid gamer I've had many opportunities to observe people's reactions during games and competitive situations. One thing I've noticed is that often a player's enjoyment of a game will lessen when it becomes obvious that they have no chance winning.</p>
<p>One of the key design elements when creating Cutthroat Pass was to make it so that during a round of play there was no indication of how well each player was doing. The winner of each round would always be a complete surprise and every player would feel right up until the last moment that they had a chance to win.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">As you'll see from the video, the combination of chance and strategy allows players of all ages to compete on a level playing field.</h3>
<p>On the night that footage was filmed the youngest player went on to win.</p>
<p>While essentially a collection game whereby players assemble a particular group of cards and relying to some extent upon chance, players are given a certain amount of control over their fate through the strategic use of action cards that can be used to either enhance their own hand or attack another player's.</p>
<p>To add tension to the game and ensure that players must remain focused not only on their own hand but on the actions of every other player, each round ends with a sudden and unexpected lunge for the pirate treasure. As with musical chairs there are always less Jewels than there are players and once one player completes their card collection and secures the first Jewel everyone else has an equal chance to snatch one before their opponents do, thus keeping the hope alive that even if you have a terrible hand you still may gain the treasure.</p>

<p>If we reach target but do not exceed it those cards will have basic colour illustrations of the action they represent e.g The Cannons card will have an illustration of a cannon.</p>

<h2> What Do We Need To Make This Game A Reality?</h2>
<h3>To give this crowdfunding project the best chance of success we are only asking for the bare minimum needed to get the game manufactured and into your hands.</h3>
<p>That said, we want you to have a high quality game so have chosen a highly talented and experienced illustrator and sourced manufacturers of shop quality games. Our intention is to create a game worthy of being sold in any game store in the world, that can hold its own against comparative games already on the market.</p>

<h2>What If We Get More Than We're Asking For?</h2>
<h3>At the moment Cutthroat Pass is still in the design stage. The beauty about not having moved on to manufacturing yet is that we have the opportunity to change and enhance the game in any way that we want.</h3>
<p>If we reach our goal we will be creating for you a professional quality game with all the basic essentials needed for hours of swashbuckling fun. However, if we exceed our goal we'll make that game even better in every way we can think of, more detailed illustrations, score cards, more treasure and even your own miniature Captain action figure to play with.  </p>

<p>The joy of doing something good, of course!</p><p>Nah, I'm just messing with you! You get awesome stuff!</p>
<h3>Postcards!</h3>
<p>I'm not going to lie - I'm not  the best artist who has ever lived. Still, everyone over the $25 level will get to choose a postcard. I'm going to put a personal touch on them, too! If you get the earlybird $25 postcard I'll even draw a cartoon character based on your MMO character!</p>

<h3>Live Funeral Ceremonies!</h3>
<p>You better sit down for this - I did the voice acting for BOTH characters in the video above! I know... Shocker, right? Anyway, using the upcoming FaceRig technology (funded right here on IndieGoGo!) I will perform a live funeral for your character!</p>
<p>Watch this tech demo for FaceRig and then just try to tell me you don't think it would be awesome to have a dragon send your character into the great server in the cloud.

<p>The days of just dropping another quarter into the machine and getting three extra lives are long gone. Every day, millions of us meet, play, talk and become friends in vast virtual worlds.</p>
<p>Massively Multiplayer Online Games are our homes away from home, a vacation spot that we can visit for as little as a few minutes or for hours on end whenever we want. It allows us to expand our imaginations, relax and bond with people from around the world.</p>
<p>Each of us does this through a single point of contact - our characters.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/544049/files/20140429223802-igg-title-2.png?1398836282"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Game players across the globe put a lot of time and effort into developing their in-game identities. Whether it's a custom skin in Minecraft or tweaking every little setting in the character editor for an MMO, we love putting a part of ourselves into each game we play.</p>
<p>Character creation is only the beginning, though. Once we enter our games, we quest for not just the best equipment, but for equipment that suits our character and our personality. Each character we create is an extension of us - and some have deeper personal connections than others.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/544059/files/20140429224718-igg-title-3.png?1398836838"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Eventually our characters will pass from our lives in one way or another. Either the game will shut down, we'll move on to another game, or we'll find ourselves in a different phase of our life.</p>
<p>When a game shuts down thousands of players can have their characters deleted. When you quit a game your character stays behind on the developer's server.</p>
<p>That's where <a href=""http://chartomb.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">charTOMB.com</a> comes in. It's a final resting place for your character. It's a place where you can upload screenshots and links to videos, post a eulogy, and even have a <b>live funeral</b> if you want.</p>
<p>My goal is to allow people to have a rich and immersive environment in which to explore and see other people's characters, to reflect on their digital lives.</p>
<p>There will also be celebrity graves for famous game characters such as Aerith, Gray Fox, even our beloved Companion Cube. These will be places where we can post and share fan art and links to the characters that have touched our lives. </p>
<p>And last, but certainly not least, will be the graves that mark the passing of friends we knew from games who passed in real life. When I first heard the <a href=""http://www.wired.com/2012/09/vilerat/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">story of Sean Smith</a> (AKA Vile rat) it really moved me.

The joy of doing something good, of course!Nah, I'm just messing with you! You get awesome stuff!
Postcards!
I'm not going to lie - I'm not  the best artist who has ever lived. Still, everyone over the $25 level will get to choose a postcard. I'm going to put a personal touch on them, too! If you get the earlybird $25 postcard I'll even draw a cartoon character based on your MMO character!

Tombstones!
There are a couple of levels where you can get a custom 3D printed tombstone for your character. At higher levels these can be made of steel!

Live Funeral Ceremonies!
You better sit down for this - I did the voice acting for BOTH characters in the video above! I know... Shocker, right? Anyway, using the upcoming FaceRig technology (funded right here on IndieGoGo!) I will perform a live funeral for your character!
Watch this tech demo for FaceRig and then just try to tell me you don't think it would be awesome to have a dragon send your character into the great server in the cloud. I dare you.Note: You don't get a copy of FaceRig, just a live funeral ceremony led by me as a FaceRig character. =)

The days of just dropping another quarter into the machine and getting three extra lives are long gone. Every day, millions of us meet, play, talk and become friends in vast virtual worlds.
Massively Multiplayer Online Games are our homes away from home, a vacation spot that we can visit for as little as a few minutes or for hours on end whenever we want. It allows us to expand our imaginations, relax and bond with people from around the world.
Each of us does this through a single point of contact - our characters.

Game players across the globe put a lot of time and effort into developing their in-game identities. Whether it's a custom skin in Minecraft or tweaking every little setting in the character editor for an MMO, we love putting a part of ourselves into each game we play.
Character creation is only the beginning, though. Once we enter our games, we quest for not just the best equipment, but for equipment that suits our character and our personality. Each character we create is an extension of us - and some have deeper personal connections than others.

Eventually our characters will pass from our lives in one way or another. Either the game will shut down, we'll move on to another game, or we'll find ourselves in a different phase of our life.
When a game shuts down thousands of players can have their characters deleted. When you quit a game your character stays behind on the developer's server.
That's where charTOMB.com comes in. It's a final resting place for your character. It's a place where you can upload screenshots and links to videos, post a eulogy, and even have a live funeral if you want.
My goal is to allow people to have a rich and immersive environment in which to explore and see other people's characters, to reflect on their digital lives.
There will also be celebrity graves for famous game characters such as Aerith, Gray Fox, even our beloved Companion Cube. These will be places where we can post and share fan art and links to the characters that have touched our lives. 
And last, but certainly not least, will be the graves that mark the passing of friends we knew from games who passed in real life. When I first heard the story of Sean Smith (AKA Vile rat) it really moved me. Here was an avid member of the EVE Online community, a diplomat in both real life and, to some degree in the game. In an interconnected age, we may not all be able to travel to attend the funerals of online friends who have passed on. That's another reason why I feel there is a need for something like this.

know?
The Fundraising Game
Learn a little - help a lot! Family fun for three
or more. Challenge your knowledge; challenge your friends. Play Go Fish with a
twist. Quick to learn - fun to play!
 
How do you play Go Snag'em?
If you know how to play Go Fish, Go Snag'em is a fun variation on this
popular game. If someone asks you whether or not you have a 2, for example, and
you do, ask the question on the card. If they answer correctly, they snag the
#2 card and make a new pair. If they are incorrect, you snag their #2 card
instead. If you want a real challenge, try to answer without the three possible
answers! It’s easy to learn, a lot of fun to play and the more often you play
the better you will be.
  
How could we use Go Snag'em in the
church?
Aside from your members wanting their own cards to play at home, Go Snag'em can be a fun way for the kids to learn more about the Bible. Each question has
a reference printed at the bottom that can be used to discover where that

</div><p><b>Where
It All Began</b></p>
<p>         Hi gamers my name is Richard.  Let me
tell you a bit about myself, most of my adult life I have been in the IT service
industry.  About 2 years ago a coworker
and I opened a small IT Consulting firm and have been growing it ever since, but what I
love is gaming.  </p>
<p>         The first time I got introduced to
gaming was in 1987, I was 5 at the time, on a visit to my next door neighbor’s
house.  I walked into the living room and
there it was an Atari 2600.  I was
instantly hooked on Frogger and Pitfall. 
Since then I have owned and gamed on most major home consoles and the
PC.  I currently own the 3DS XL, PS4, and
XBOX One along with a gaming PC I upgrade every two years or so.  As you can see I don’t believe in one
platform being superior to another, I game for the experiences no matter what
platform they are on. </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>The
Deal</b></p>
<p>         gBuds will be a member’s only adult PC
gaming community based in the US.  Have you ever logged
into a Minecraft server where you built your base just to find out somebody
came in and destroyed it for no reason?  Ever
played Space Engineers and have somebody crash their ship into your base just
to ruin your day?  How about playing a
shooter where they repeatedly kill you at spawn? 
I envision a place where gamers can come together to game, without the more
negative aspects that plague gaming and the internet as a whole.  </p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Why
become a member?</b></p>
<p><b>·</b><b> </b>
An exclusive member’s only forum with a code of
conduct written with input from the community. 
If you are found breaking one of the rules there will be penalties based

the servers.  I think this is missing in
today’s gaming to forester that sense of community social media just doesn't
cut it.</p>

<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span></span>We set the game
in a post-apocalyptic world. For us, and we hope for you, the grimness and severity of stories told in such a setting inspires and captures the imagination. We feel (and know) that the harsh
and bizarre (and sometimes offbeat) places found in the best works of the genre are a
perfect place to explore what it is to be human, and test long-held concepts of ""humanity"" under extreme conditions, both story and game-wise.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Some of our favorites in this genre are the the Fallout series of games, the Mad Max films and the Matrix Trilogy. We also draw inspiration from classic strategy games like the original UFO: Enemy Unknown, Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri and Star Control 2. Decimation is also influenced by console games that we immensely enjoyed as kids: Konami’s Jackal (known as “Top Gunner” in North America) and SNK’s Great Tank (“Iron Tank” in  North America).<br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With Decimation, we set out to create a world that
captures the same severity and evoke similar feelings as those found in works that
have inspired us. In the end, we want to create a gaming experience
that is both enjoyable and challenging and to have told a satisfying story as
well.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The game started a few years ago as a personal project. In November 2012, I decided to work on the game full time. It has seen steady but slow development until more members of the team were drawn into the project. Progress started picking up as the rest of the team trickled in. They have been kind enough to contribute their time and skills to the game outside of their day jobs and without pay. Since then, we have accomplished much but there’s a lot more work ahead!</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If you have taken the time to watch the video, you can see
our potential and what inspired these guys to come on board. Decimation's game world needs to be further populated. The
particle system and animation needs to be improved in several places. We have
completed about 40% of the planned player, enemy, structural and environmental
art assets and models, leaving about 60% yet to create.  The music and ambient sounds needs scoring
and mastering. We are also in the process of overhauling the HUD and in-game
menus. Several major and minor (but important) gameplay features remain to be
implemented. We are currently somewhere between First Playable and very Early
Alpha stage.</span></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>A: </b>This campaign in particular is to raise funds to complete Decimation's PC version. Back when the project started we decided to use the XNA 4.0 framework and have made a lot of headway on the game's custom engine since then. Prior to launching the campaign, we were considering 2 options to be able to cover Mac and Linux versions of the game. One involved obtaining a license for Unity3D or to port the existing game into Monogame for multi-platform development. Both options would have increased our budget by a significant amount, and would require an extra programmer if we still want to meet our completion deadline of 1 year. If you're a Mac or Linux user, don't count us out yet though. We definitely don't want to close our doors to you, and if there is significant interest in the current project, we can add Mac and Linux coverage as a stretch goal.</span></p>

Base building


Open world exploration


Action-oriented vehicular combat


Tower defense


Resource management


Deep research mechanics

Combat unit customization







You are the leader of a community of survivors who make their home in a remote pre-war military installation. After the old world ended, your people have not ventured far beyond the protection afforded by the mountains surrounding the colony. Not much is known to you about what lies outside the walls of rock that you call home. One thing is certain: The isolation that spared your people from the worst of the cataclysm has become a curse. Technology that has long sustained the colony is giving in to the ravages of time. Food and water are running low.










To succeed, you will have to make good use of what the colony has on hand to brave the vast undiscovered wastes, seeking out resources and lost technology. The myriad denizens of the wasteland will challenge your claim to travel their territories. Succeeding on missions will allow you to obtain key pieces of technology that you need to research from a deep technology tree, bringing your colony out of subsistence and into mastery of the wastes.
Your tactical and strategic skills will be put the test as you make choices on what missions to undertake, which technology to pursue, how to customize your armaments and what command skills to develop. Good decisions in all of these areas will help assure that enemies do not breach the colony’s defenses and that your colony has all it needs to thrive. 










The explorable world map spans 400,000 square miles / 640,000 square kilometers (about twice the size of Texas). Aside from requiring in-game time, travelling through the game world will require fuel and supplies for your units and people. You will need to plan ahead. Choose your unit composition and  missions wisely. You do not want to find yourself stranded in the middle of a vast wasteland populated by raiding parties, maniacal warlords, hostile machines and mutated beasts, out of fuel, food and ammunition…







The main story arc will guide you through the game. Along the way, you can choose to go on a variety of side missions including trade runs, convoy escorts, scavenging for resources and technology, helping certain inhabitants of the wasteland to join your cause, or just good old search and destroy.
You never know who or what is lurking about and will certainly encounter groups, factions or creatures that will not take kindly to your actions. They will seek you out. It will only be a matter of time before they find your colony…





Fortunately, the military base has a few defensive emplacements and combat vehicles that the colony has managed to keep functional over the years. These machines have kept you and your people safe so far, but you can never have too much protection. 



The colony's defensive emplacements and units are customizable. You can dabble with different configurations. New upgrades can be unlocked through research or by acquiring new tech in the wasteland.







Before the war that devastated the planet, the colony was a secret military weapons testing facility. It has seen better days but the technology remains intact (more or less). The world you have to contend with is more treacherous than before, and whatever “advanced” technology the colony possesses may not be enough to deal with what’s out there.





Prior to your predecessor’s passing, you had some experience in combat. Now that you’re in charge, you will need to pick up new skills to succeed as colony steward.
As you gain experience, you can expand your effectiveness by assigning points to 19 unique Commander Skills. Not all of them can be mastered, so you should choose where you assign these points carefully. Being strong in some areas can compensate for weaknesses in other areas. Others skills you may find indispensable.
Commander Skills fall under three main categories:
1. Unit Skills influence the effectiveness of weapons used in combat.
2. Battlefield Skills influence the colony’s broader combat capabilities and heavily influences colony defense.
3. Colony Skills influence colony productivity and morale.





You will have 4 lieutenants/advisers that will help look out for your people. There will be situations where heeding their advice will be in the colony's best interests. In some cases, you might find that you should have trusted your gut instead.

In addition to the main plot, each adviser has a unique story which you can explore depending on the choices that you make, perhaps unlocking previously hidden technology or knowledge of the wasteland in the process.






At the beginning of
the game, your colony will only have a few citizens. Each citizen represents the
population of the colony that can be directed and are capable of working on
various tasks. You can assign citizens to one of the following functional
areas:


Engineering: Building, repairing and upgrading the colony’s Units, Structures, Equipment and Consumable items.


Research: Advancing technology that helps the
colony be more efficient, more successful in defending against the environment,
or more effective in exploration and combat. 


Reconnaissance: Scouting the areas of the game world and uncovering tactical information about wasteland locations and factions. 


Logistics: Collecting, moving and storing colony supplies and
resources.


Combat: Manning defensive or offensive units/structures.


Each citizen that is
assigned to one of these fields contributes to the completion of tasks
associated to that particular field. As you build a stronger presence in the wasteland, the likelihood of newer citizens joining your cause increases.




How effective and
efficient the citizens are will be affected by a variety of factors such as:



Food supply


Living conditions

The state of your main colony structures

Your leadership (Commander Skills)


Victory or defeat in
battle



Fail to balance these
aspects and your people will suffer performance penalties, leave the colony
or die a gruesome death.
Don’t let that happen! Rise to the challenge and lead your colony from decimation to being a force to shape the wasteland!

We set the game
in a post-apocalyptic world. For us, and we hope for you, the grimness and severity of stories told in such a setting inspires and captures the imagination. We feel (and know) that the harsh
and bizarre (and sometimes offbeat) places found in the best works of the genre are a
perfect place to explore what it is to be human, and test long-held concepts of ""humanity"" under extreme conditions, both story and game-wise.
Some of our favorites in this genre are the the Fallout series of games, the Mad Max films and the Matrix Trilogy. We also draw inspiration from classic strategy games like the original UFO: Enemy Unknown, Sid Meier’s Alpha Centauri and Star Control 2. Decimation is also influenced by console games that we immensely enjoyed as kids: Konami’s Jackal (known as “Top Gunner” in North America) and SNK’s Great Tank (“Iron Tank” in  North America).
With Decimation, we set out to create a world that
captures the same severity and evoke similar feelings as those found in works that
have inspired us. In the end, we want to create a gaming experience
that is both enjoyable and challenging and to have told a satisfying story as
well.







The game started a few years ago as a personal project. In November 2012, I decided to work on the game full time. It has seen steady but slow development until more members of the team were drawn into the project. Progress started picking up as the rest of the team trickled in. They have been kind enough to contribute their time and skills to the game outside of their day jobs and without pay. Since then, we have accomplished much but there’s a lot more work ahead!
If you have taken the time to watch the video, you can see
our potential and what inspired these guys to come on board. Decimation's game world needs to be further populated. The
particle system and animation needs to be improved in several places. We have
completed about 40% of the planned player, enemy, structural and environmental
art assets and models, leaving about 60% yet to create.  The music and ambient sounds needs scoring
and mastering. We are also in the process of overhauling the HUD and in-game
menus. Several major and minor (but important) gameplay features remain to be
implemented. We are currently somewhere between First Playable and very Early
Alpha stage.





I cannot question the team’s passion for the project, as they have been pouring in the volunteer hours to develop the game outside of their primary jobs. The reality though, is that without paid positions, project completion will not be a speedy proposition. People need to prioritize endeavors that respect the value of their skills and expertise. 
Your contribution will allow us to:


Transition key members of the team to full-time paid
positions, and compensate part time and contract staff, thereby
accelerating progress. 

Score the game's soundtrack. 



Purchase much needed equipment upgrades to accelerate development and acquire certain software packages that will enhance the game.

Ensure that day-to-day office requirements (general overhead, power, internet) are taken care of. Keep the power on! 





Based on the scope of the project (and with your help to fund it), we plan to to go Beta in about eight months and to release the polished/full game a year from funding (November 2014). This is a carefully deliberated timeline that provides a little allowance for the unforeseen. We would love to get the game to you as quickly as possible without sacrificing quality.
We have chosen fixed funding because we cannot meet the commitment of completing and polishing the game in a year with less. The funding goal is the absolute minimum we will need to bring you a quality game and fulfill the perks for the campaign.



Help us spread the word! Tell your friends and personal network
about the project to help us reach more potential players and funders. Bringing
in more supporters will go a long way towards making Decimation a reality. 



As gamers ourselves, we value
the community that forms around a game. And your referrals are part of that. Which is why we are running a humble,
but important, Referral Contest. We will reward the top 5
people (or organizations) that have spread the word and directed people to the Decimation campaign page. 

At
the end of the campaign (if our initial funding goal is reached), the five people who direct the most traffic to our campaign page will receive the
""Road Warrior"" perk, our
heartfelt gratitude in the form of a personalized thank you letter from the team, and the title “Networking Contributor” in the game's credits.
Moreover, the individual/organization who raises the highest amount of funds for the campaign (calculated as: your referrals' contributions plus your own contribution) will be given the distinct opportunity to design the colony's military emblem. The emblem is colony's link to its military roots and the symbol of its persistence in the wasteland. It will be used and displayed throughout the game: In the opening sequence and on colony structures & units. It will also be printed at the back of the Decimation campaign shirt. This winner will also get the ""Road
Warrior"" perk, our heartfelt gratitude in the form of a personalized thank you
letter from the team, and the title “Creative Contributor” in the
credits.




If you copy the campaign URL (found in the ""Share This Campaign"" box below the pitch video) and paste it into an email or social media update OR if you click on one of the share tools also found in the box below our pitch video (Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, Embed, Email), that will allow you to share the campaign and direct people to the Decimation's Indiegogo campaign page.
As long as you are logged into your Indiegogo account when you use the share tools, sharing will allow us to keep track of how many people are taken to the campaign page via the sharing option(s) that you have used and will be attributed to your Indiegogo account. 
If people you've referred end up contributing to the campaign, your Indiegogo account will be recognized as bringing in that amount to the campaign as well.
If you do not have an Indiegogo account, you can still have your referrals tracked once you've contributed to the campaign. You will be presented with a special URL immediately after completing your contribution that you can copy and share with your network. We would recommend that you create an Indiegogo account prior to sharing though, as it is not that difficult and would ensure that your referral and contribution count is attributed to a single account.

We'd like to thank you for reviewing our campaign page, and for your interest in being part of Decimation's success!
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:
Q: Any chance for a Linux (or Mac) version of the game?
A: This campaign in particular is to raise funds to complete Decimation's PC version. Back when the project started we decided to use the XNA 4.0 framework and have made a lot of headway on the game's custom engine since then. Prior to launching the campaign, we were considering 2 options to be able to cover Mac and Linux versions of the game. One involved obtaining a license for Unity3D or to port the existing game into Monogame for multi-platform development. Both options would have increased our budget by a significant amount, and would require an extra programmer if we still want to meet our completion deadline of 1 year. If you're a Mac or Linux user, don't count us out yet though. We definitely don't want to close our doors to you, and if there is significant interest in the current project, we can add Mac and Linux coverage as a stretch goal.",33.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>Control</b><br/>Skyliner is a third person stealth game where you control the environment. You have access to every aspect of your environment; doors, lights, lasers, surveillance, turrets, androids, transporters, platforms and even entire rooms.<br/>Use your power to alter your surroundings and reach your goal and to distract, trap or kill your enemies.<br/><br/><b>Lighting<br/></b>A unique lighting system will allow you to dynamically control every light. The AI will use this system to determine visibility in real time. When you disable the lights in an area, you will be able to bypass your enemy as they stumble towards the nearest light source switch. Watch out, as any moving light, like transporter headlights or flashlights can still illuminate you and get you caught.<br/><br/><b>Artificial Intelligence<br/></b>The foundation of every stealth game is a good AI system. Skyliner will have a complex AI that will react realistically to every situation. Your enemies will use teamwork to lock you in and take you out.<br/>They will react to your presence when they see or hear you and will react differently to every disturbance. When locked inside a room, they will try to get out by searching for a door lock or call for backup when completely locked in.<br/><br/><b>Know your Enemy</b><br/>Skyliner will have diverse and dangerous enemies, all with different reactions to the player and ways of handling a situation. Besides humanoid enemies, you will also encounter androids that are faster and stronger. Some androids will be able to go through tight spaces such as air ducts.<br/><br/><b>Traps</b><br/>Besides regular enemies, you will also encounter traps such as lasers, mines, surveillance and moving platforms. Use your power to use these to your advantage.<br/><br/><b>Sound</b><br/>The AI will react to every sound they hear. They investigate strange footsteps and will search the area when hearing gunshots.<br/>Sounds will overlap in Skyliner, meaning you can run past a machine that is humming loudly. Strategic use of this system allows you to control a speaker and make it emit a sound to either distract an enemy or to drown out your footsteps.<br/><br/><b>Combat<br/></b>You will be able to defend yourself against enemies by using your only weapon, the Striker 7.<br/>The Striker 7 will be completely customizable in functionality and design. You can place scopes and silencers on it, extended magazines and more.<br/>Because magazines for the Striker 7 will be scarce, you need to preserve ammo as much as possible. Be as accurate as you can.<br/><br/>You can also take out unsuspecting enemies by sneaking up on them and breaking their neck. When the enemy has noticed you, you will not be able to perform any grabs.<br/><br/>Hunter cannot take much damage, so try to avoid combat.<br/><br/><b>Story Driven<br/></b>Skyliner<b> </b>is story driven, non-linear game.<br/>Depending on your actions the story will change and will lead to multiple different endings.<br/>The levels will be open with multiple ways to go through, some paths more dangerous and rewarding than others.<br/><br/>

Development is well underway with the concept and the basics of gameplay all ready.<br/><br/><b>Platforms</b><br/>The game is being developed for Windows, Linux and Mac and will be available DRM free as a standalone download.<br/>A Steam release is also planned after a succesful campaign and Greenlight process.<br/><br/><b>Questions?</b><br/>If you have any questions, feel free to post a

</div></div>","The year is 2049.Zack Hunter wakes up inside a pod, connected to wires and pins.The pod opens and Hunter gets out. He looks at his hands and sees cold metal and circuitry. Slowly realizing what happened to him, he walks towards the terminal near his storage pod. The terminal shows a log and a profile of Hunter.The log states that Hunter has been there for several months, connected to the machine. It shows data about an extraction process that failed.Hunter drops to his knees and looks at his hands. Faint footsteps can be heard coming from the hallway. Someone is coming to collect him.
  

ControlSkyliner is a third person stealth game where you control the environment. You have access to every aspect of your environment; doors, lights, lasers, surveillance, turrets, androids, transporters, platforms and even entire rooms.Use your power to alter your surroundings and reach your goal and to distract, trap or kill your enemies.LightingA unique lighting system will allow you to dynamically control every light. The AI will use this system to determine visibility in real time. When you disable the lights in an area, you will be able to bypass your enemy as they stumble towards the nearest light source switch. Watch out, as any moving light, like transporter headlights or flashlights can still illuminate you and get you caught.Artificial IntelligenceThe foundation of every stealth game is a good AI system. Skyliner will have a complex AI that will react realistically to every situation. Your enemies will use teamwork to lock you in and take you out.They will react to your presence when they see or hear you and will react differently to every disturbance. When locked inside a room, they will try to get out by searching for a door lock or call for backup when completely locked in.Know your EnemySkyliner will have diverse and dangerous enemies, all with different reactions to the player and ways of handling a situation. Besides humanoid enemies, you will also encounter androids that are faster and stronger. Some androids will be able to go through tight spaces such as air ducts.TrapsBesides regular enemies, you will also encounter traps such as lasers, mines, surveillance and moving platforms. Use your power to use these to your advantage.SoundThe AI will react to every sound they hear. They investigate strange footsteps and will search the area when hearing gunshots.Sounds will overlap in Skyliner, meaning you can run past a machine that is humming loudly. Strategic use of this system allows you to control a speaker and make it emit a sound to either distract an enemy or to drown out your footsteps.CombatYou will be able to defend yourself against enemies by using your only weapon, the Striker 7.The Striker 7 will be completely customizable in functionality and design. You can place scopes and silencers on it, extended magazines and more.Because magazines for the Striker 7 will be scarce, you need to preserve ammo as much as possible. Be as accurate as you can.You can also take out unsuspecting enemies by sneaking up on them and breaking their neck. When the enemy has noticed you, you will not be able to perform any grabs.Hunter cannot take much damage, so try to avoid combat.Story DrivenSkyliner is story driven, non-linear game.Depending on your actions the story will change and will lead to multiple different endings.The levels will be open with multiple ways to go through, some paths more dangerous and rewarding than others.
  



About meMy name is Peter Verstappen and I'm the sole developer of Skyliner.Skyliner is an ambitious project that I started working on around late 2012.I wanted to create a 3D stealth game that was not combat oriented and would encourage players to stay out of sight and try to distract and outsmart the enemy with a unique gameplay element, instead of shooting their way out. Development is well underway with the concept and the basics of gameplay all ready.PlatformsThe game is being developed for Windows, Linux and Mac and will be available DRM free as a standalone download.A Steam release is also planned after a succesful campaign and Greenlight process.Questions?If you have any questions, feel free to post a 
comment. I will be updating the campaign as much as possible to keep you
 informed about the progress.
