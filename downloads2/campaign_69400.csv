of the large factories of industrial bread during last years, many retail

healthiest breads made with 100% organic products, naturally leavened with long

</h3>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The bread was made using an millenary method, using only a mixture of flour, water, salt and natural leaven, until the bakers start to utilize a microscopic fungus, called Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Mautner process, Austria 19th century, concretely in 1846), giving rise to mass production of industrial  processes, shortening the fermentation to the detriment of the quality.</span></h4>
<h4>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We produce bread following a method that dates back to thousands of year, to make our daily bread, we first prepare our natural liquid leaven, on the basis of a culture of lactic acid bacteria and wild yeasts contained into it, which we refresh daily adding more flour and more water in order to nourish this culture and thus keep it live; thereafter the ferment taking about eight hours for optimal ripening.</span>

</div></div>","Why 4-Elements? 

The Greeks, along with many other cultures, used an elemental system to explain the nature of life, according to the Greeks; there were four major elements, earth, air, water, and fire which were viewed as more spiritual in nature.

Using the Greek classical elements, people tried to explain the nature of the world around them, many people believed that the elements worked in a way which promoted balance, and that disturbances in this balance were the root cause of things like natural disasters and health problems, for this reason correcting an imbalance of elements was considered critical for well-being.
We such as the ancient Greeks want to maintain the perfect balance of nature, and for that we give the best of ourselves to make our products, preserving the environment and contributing to the health and well-being of people.




Who we are:

We are Silvia Tapia and
Toni Tapia; two young entrepreneurial promoters of this project; we are joined
for the enthusiasm and the love for the art of bakery since it us comes from
heritage.




 


Our Story Begins:


Back in 1984, the
Tapia-Alapont family began in the fascinating art of bakery at the hand of our
parents, uncles and grandparents in Algemesí, a small town in the sunny province of Valencia,
located on the east of Spain at the seashore of The Mediterranean Sea.




Our family learned
from one older marriage, owners of an antique bakery which had a wood fired
brick oven, they taught them the craft of bakers to old-fashioned way, after
them took this bakery business.





Due to the strong growth
of the large factories of industrial bread during last years, many retail
bakeries began to close, In view of this, we had an idea to use the expertise
acquired for our family so that they work with us and together taking the alternative
to large industrial bread factories, promoting the sustainable consumption of
healthiest breads made with 100% organic products, naturally leavened with long
fermentations, handcrafted, non-GMO and chemical-free, what to large bread
factories cannot offer.

Innovative Bakery Concept:


Our idea consist in to train teams of young bakers committed to work to development of organic breads, which can manage bakeries, old restored, as well as of new creation, all forming part of a single cooperative society, do no forget that ""Unity is Strength"".




Each person that's incorporated to work together us, at the same time that receives their training, until to achieve the sufficient expertise to manage autonomously a bakery, included within a single cooperative, which will provide a large number of advantages, how to buy best price, support in the marketing of the products carry out joint marketing campaigns , better administrative management, as well as government aids and grants that receive this type of entities.






First we want open
a pilot bakery* in Valencia (Spain) and after go opening more of a gradual
manner.

Our
intention is to transfer this project model in the near future to the United States,
if it is carried out and consolidated first in Spain with succes; for this we need the
support of American people who share the same ideas and are excited in this
project; then we will can share the experience gained in its implementation
and consolidation.
If all goes as planned, we will be ready to start activity in February 2016.
*Currently we haven't bakery of our property, but we want to rent one shortly.

Know-how:


The bread was made using an millenary method, using only a mixture of flour, water, salt and natural leaven, until the bakers start to utilize a microscopic fungus, called Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Mautner process, Austria 19th century, concretely in 1846), giving rise to mass production of industrial  processes, shortening the fermentation to the detriment of the quality.

We produce bread following a method that dates back to thousands of year, to make our daily bread, we first prepare our natural liquid leaven, on the basis of a culture of lactic acid bacteria and wild yeasts contained into it, which we refresh daily adding more flour and more water in order to nourish this culture and thus keep it live; thereafter the ferment taking about eight hours for optimal ripening.






We elaborated unhurried, investing time that bread needed for to develop aromas and flavors of natural form as well as natural organic compounds that make the bread more digestive, nutritious and healthy.




After kneading we ferment the dough at a temperature conducive to the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria and wild yeasts which is when develop aromas and flavors of bread, after this bulk fermentation, we started with bread making process handmade to confer a texture and a honeycombed crumb that using mechanical methods are not obtained.







Finally after the last fermentation, called proofing, (the final rise of shaped bread dough before baking) we unload the unbaked dough loaves over the stone floor oven for a thicker and crispy crust.







From the first refreshing of the Leaven (Sourdough) to coming out of the oven, our bread takes around 18 hours to be produced.




Values: 
The origin of the raw material





For
the elaboration of our bread, we only use organic ingredients: Flour*, mineral
water, unrefined sea salt and a culture of lactic acid bacteria and wild yeasts
contained in our natural liquid leaven also called Sourdough, Levain or Mother
Dough.







Our
special breads: Rosquilletas (Valencian breadsticks) and rolls we produce with
flour* , mineral water, unrefined sea salt, natural liquid leaven, extra virgin
olive oil, seeds and aromatic Mediterranean herbs, all of these of organic
origin.
*Organic stone ground grain flours (whole and white): Wheat, rye, spelt, 
 kamut and Multigrain. 





Another
Valencian specialty know since the century XVll is La Pataqueta d'Horta (Bread of
the Valencian Orchard) were made by the farmers and baked in small wood
fired brick oven that were next to the “barracas”
(cabin of farmer). 
This bread is similar to the Italian Ciabatta but with
a Lima Bean Shape, characterized by
high water content and honeycomb crumbstructure with irregular open cells.



Naturally Leavened Bread makes a difference
This
type of fermented breads with natural leaven provides great advantages compared
to industrial bread fermented with industrial yeasts produced massively, which
brings high profitability at the expense of quality.


The
first advantage it offers is gastronomic, because the flavor and aroma is
incomparable.
Second:
the industrial yeast causes that bread acquires by the simple formation of gas
(CO2) the texture similar to of a sponge, while the fermentation process with
natural leaven in addition has a modifying effect in the flour breaking
down proteins into amino acids, turning
it into more digestible.
Third:
it is known that certain substances such as phytates *, especially present in
the bran cereals, they unfold thanks to the natural leaven forming compounds much more
healthy.
* The phytic acid or phytates can be mixed with certain minerals and 

  impede or inhibit its absorption. This happens for example with iron 

  (whose deficiency causes anemia) or with copper (which stimulates
  immunity). Many anti-nutrients (which impede the absorption of some 

  nutrients).




Fourth:
The glycemic impact
of Naturally Leavened
Bread is low as compared to commercial yeast,
aiding in ensuring that your blood glucose level remains in line, helping
to guard against various diseases such as diabetes.
Fifth:
the ideal bread, fermented with natural leaven, has a crust
more crunchy, irregular honeycomb and preserved several days without staling.



Sustainable
development
Eco-friendly product:
Maximum
respect for the environment.
Energy consumption: Use
of clean and renewable energy; the energy required to heat the oven is mainly
obtained from solid biomass comes mainly from wood remains of forestry,
forestry and recycling of wood industries, the use of biomass as fuel does not
increase the content of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and, therefore, not
attributed the greenhouse effect; other energy used to a lesser extent is the
electricity for the bread fermentation chamber and some small machines.






Recycling:Fully recyclable packaging, using recycled materials.







Environmental impact:
Practically
null for the proper management of waste, use of renewable and clean
energies, together with a system of filters installed in the chimney of the
oven whose fully developed technology and known operates with very high yields
and, therefore, get withhold percentages very high total of generated
particles.





Transportation: Logistics rational and structured




Strategy:
Importance of Spread the Sales Points
This allows us to develop a network
of elaboration and sale points increasing, where people can purchase your
organic bread freshly baked at an affordable price. 
This product in Spain so far only
found on the shelves of health food stores, already baked and packaged and some
in specialty bakeries widely scattered from each other, both sold at high
prices.


Creating jobs
The young bakers teams trained
by us, in near future they will manage bakeries of new creation, as well as
restored old bakeries, them will forming a network of bakeries that it will
grow by the support of a single cooperative society, that will increase the
jobs of gradually manner.
The Market
The organic food
products market in Spain will grow by 25% by year until 2020, according to Everis*.
Therefore ""we are in the right place at the right time""
Among the main barriers to domestic
growth in the sector are the high price, lack of awareness and the difficulty
of finding organic products outside of specialized shops.




*Everis is a multinational consulting firm
providing business and strategy solutions, application development,
maintenance, and outsourcing services. Established in 1996,everis has averaged 20% annual growth in
revenues and became part of NTT Data in January, 2014.



The main global market is the United
States, which consume organic products worth of 21.038 Millions of €, while
Spain is the seventh European place and tenth worldwide.






The rise in consumption of organic

currently in Spain is acquired at high prices, principally in special organic
stores and very specialized bakeries that are widely dispersed from each other.
We will contribute to people
having easy accessibility and more reasonable prices, at the same time as we
will create jobs of gradually manner.
Risks
& Challenges
The spreading quickness of our products
of bakery will depend on the time that people need for to be aware of the great
benefits that contributes, both in health as a gastronomically, and since then
increase the demand.

We are convinced that this will
happen in a short period of time, because the media have begun to document the
population of the great benefits they bring to the health of organic products.
The most prestigious consulting firms
forecast that deadline for people take aware and consume more products natural
and organic will happen in the short term of five years, with an annual growth
of 25%.

<h3><strong>Software FAQ and specifications</strong></h3>
<p><strong><b>1. How Do I Make Money Using Your Software?</b><br/></strong></p>
<p>It's really simple. Whether you use the software for personal purposes or you have a sales team, you can use your/their accounts and build your network and get in touch with your relevant audience. Once you've built your network you can now start approaching your leads. We give you the tools(the software) and it's up to you how effectively you will use it. If you are not good at sales or marketing, hire a specialist to write you messages and test them out.</p>
<p>The software has been tested on tens of accounts generating instant results and respectively revenue. </p>
<p><strong>2. I have heard that LinkedIn limits the number of messages that could be sent to group members. Is this software capable of overcome that?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! After spending years on research and development, we have found a way which allows you to send unlimited number of messages to any group members. Even if you get “You are no longer authorized to message to this member” message, the software can send message without any problem. So you don’t have to worry about that.</p>
<p>*Hot Tip: Keep the count below 50-100 per day.</p>
<p><strong>3. Does it work on Mac OS</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it works on any OS that supports Google Chrome browser. It is a Google chrome extension ( which is not available on Google Play store).</p>

Compared to all other LinkedIn software available on the market, our software actually generates you money. None of the current software on the web can offer you that!
LinkedIn Autopilot tells you they will increase your LinkedIn Profile rank. So what? If this ranking doesn't bring you money on the table, what's the point of using it on a monthly basis?
Why for LinkedIn?
With over 384,000,000 users LinkedIn is the largest business network in the world. 



More than 80% of the LinkedIn members are considered key decision makers compared to Facebook.

Its publishing platform – Pulse is becoming more and more popular among managers, executives, entrepreneurs, marketers, public speakers, and businesses. The idea of becoming an “Influencer” and getting your post seen by millions of business and recruitment oriented audience becomes more lucrative.Our Linkedin Auto Messaging software has 2 essential functions to fully automated your leads generation needs:

Software FAQ and specifications
1. How Do I Make Money Using Your Software?
It's really simple. Whether you use the software for personal purposes or you have a sales team, you can use your/their accounts and build your network and get in touch with your relevant audience. Once you've built your network you can now start approaching your leads. We give you the tools(the software) and it's up to you how effectively you will use it. If you are not good at sales or marketing, hire a specialist to write you messages and test them out.
The software has been tested on tens of accounts generating instant results and respectively revenue. 
2. I have heard that LinkedIn limits the number of messages that could be sent to group members. Is this software capable of overcome that?
Yes! After spending years on research and development, we have found a way which allows you to send unlimited number of messages to any group members. Even if you get “You are no longer authorized to message to this member” message, the software can send message without any problem. So you don’t have to worry about that.
*Hot Tip: Keep the count below 50-100 per day.
3. Does it work on Mac OS
Yes, it works on any OS that supports Google Chrome browser. It is a Google chrome extension ( which is not available on Google Play store).

<h3>Testimonials </h3>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>“I loved my floral arrangement made with Floral Soil™. The
flowers held up very well for nearly two weeks and required very little water
compared to the green foam. The Floral Soil™ was re-used and we now have various
forms of mint, basil, oregano and English cucumbers growing. Each plant
originated in “Floral Soil™” as either a cutting or seed and was transferred to
larger outdoor planters on my deck. It is a real treat to see plants growing
and thriving in something that would have normally thrown away. ”</p>
<p>- Judy S., Bellingham, WA

</p>
<p><span>“I’m really impressed with Floral Soil’s performance and
flexibility. I had a floral arrangement made for my daughter’s baby shower.
After about 10 days, the old flowers were removed and others added to the same
foam. The second arrangement lasted for another 10-12 days. After the two
arrangements had gone, I took cuttings from my fuschia plant and inserted them
into the foam. Root formation was evident about four days later and now they
are starting to bloom. ”</span></p>

"" A product that can be used and reused for floral design, seed and
cuttings propagation, and then eventual soil enrichment when it is ""used

of chemicals in common consumer products which are assumed to be safe until
proven otherwise. And

<p></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise <b>$30,000</b> to bring this project to life. We'll be able to upgrade our do-it-yourself homemade studio into a professional, well-equipped, screen printing studio on-the-go.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Your donation will allow us to offer a wider range of services more efficiently: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the quantity of printable units per hour </li>
<li>Decreasing wear and tear on valuable equipment </li>
<li>Improving the quality of our art and prints</li>
<li>Advancing efficiency in labor and production for staff</li>
<li>Increasing our capacity for in-house printing capabilities</li>
<li>Expanding our travel range to be able to cover a larger demographic</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Mobile. </b>The most important item we are trying to attain is a step van ($12,000) that we can customize into our mobile studio. The customization will include retrofitting the interior to become our rollin’ lab. It will house a modified printing press, a portable conveyer dryer, a washout sink, built-in clothing racks and shelves to hold the equipment as we move swiftly from one location to another. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>More specifically we need one raceway six-arm press ($950), two Vastex D-100 conveyer dryers ($1,475 each), new display banners ($300) and storage equipment ($700). Our goal is to dispatch up to two teams on any given day to cover the number of requests we receive. This equipment will be run by our second street team who we are currently in the process of training.</p>
<p><i>***The truck will be also tricked out with a fresh new paint job <i>($2000)</i> by none other than DC's finest,<b> <a href=""http://www.chelove.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cita Sadeli CHELOVE</a></b>, <i>and a booming sound system ($800) to keep the party bumpin'.*** </i></i></p>
<div>
<p><b>Print.</b> We are also looking to purchase a Riley Hopkins six-arm two-station press ($1,700). These presses are more industrial, so we can run bigger jobs longer in our print studio. We will need a washout booth ($450) and new table top exposure unit ($395) to ensure the artwork meets our high quality control standards.</p>
<ul>
</ul>
<b>Technology.</b> We would like to upgrade our digital equipment with a new inkjet printer with Accurip software ($999), a Macbook pro ($2000) and a two Surface Pro 4 tablets ($700 each). The inkjet printer will move us into the next phase of our screen printing design capabilities. We will be able to offer all-over printing and four-color process printing. The new digital systems will increase our speed and we'll be able to provide high-quality artwork sooner.<br/><h3><b><b><i><br/><b><i><h2>What You Will Receive in Return<br/>

We are reaching out to our community to help fund the dream! Help bring something fun, new and down right funky to DC. We've got less than 60 days to raise the funds to bring our dream to the 
streets. Think of it like an ice cream truck, only slingin' ink and fresh t-shirt flavor for days. Go go 
go! 
Help Fund DC's 1st Mobile Screen Printing TRUCK!



Live screen printing is a fun way to make art and art education accessible to all communities and people of all ages and skill levels.



Help Us Make This Party-to-Go a Reality
Soul & Ink launched last March and in just seven months, we’ve been booked back-to-back activating all types of events including: National Cherry Blossom Festival, Global Citizen’s Earth Day, University of Maryland’s NextNow Fest and Discovery Wellness Expo.


During this time we discovered that our concept is in demand and learned a lot about how to improve our process. We are ready to take the customer experience to the next level, but now we need your help to expand.
We are self-taught screen printers who started out in our basement using a small one-arm press, hanging t-shirts to dry on a clothesline, but we have the professional design chops and non-stop work ethic to make this dream happen.

How You Can Support Every dollar counts! The perks you will receive for 
your contributions are the sweet rewards listed on the right-hand 
column. Scroll down to peep the design menu to design your own t-shirt! Your contribution plays a critical role in 
bringing The First Fully Equipped Live Screen Printing Studio on Wheels to the DC Area while also supporting a local, minority-owned small business.
Crowdfunding allows you to become involved in our creative venture. 
As a contributor you will receive exclusive updates and can even take 
part in the design process! It also enables us to be debt-free and 
self-employed, while offering a unique art form and experience to the 
community.


About Soul & Ink


Soul
 & Ink provides a fun, interactive art experience for all types of 
events. As the premiere live screen printing business in the DC area, we
 can activate any space with a four-color press, ink, apparel and 
one-of-a-kind imagery. It's our passion to create custom artwork that 
can be shared with anyone, anywhere. 
Soul & Ink is the brainchild of husband and wife award-winning design team, Frankie
 and Sherry Meneses. As advocates of design for social change, they were
 determined to find a way to be involved directly in the community. They
 were inspired to create a mobile screen printing set-up after seeing 
how stoked their friends were at screen printing parties they hosted at 
home. It was an instant hit! 

Participants don’t have to be trained artists to take pride in 
an original piece they help create. Live screen printing takes events to
 the next level, with an undeniable cool factor and an interactive 
experience that leaves crowds buzzing for days.


What We Need to Grow

Our goal is to raise $30,000 to bring this project to life. We'll be able to upgrade our do-it-yourself homemade studio into a professional, well-equipped, screen printing studio on-the-go.

Your donation will allow us to offer a wider range of services more efficiently: 

Increasing the quantity of printable units per hour 
Decreasing wear and tear on valuable equipment 
Improving the quality of our art and prints
Advancing efficiency in labor and production for staff
Increasing our capacity for in-house printing capabilities
Expanding our travel range to be able to cover a larger demographic

Mobile. The most important item we are trying to attain is a step van ($12,000) that we can customize into our mobile studio. The customization will include retrofitting the interior to become our rollin’ lab. It will house a modified printing press, a portable conveyer dryer, a washout sink, built-in clothing racks and shelves to hold the equipment as we move swiftly from one location to another. 

More specifically we need one raceway six-arm press ($950), two Vastex D-100 conveyer dryers ($1,475 each), new display banners ($300) and storage equipment ($700). Our goal is to dispatch up to two teams on any given day to cover the number of requests we receive. This equipment will be run by our second street team who we are currently in the process of training.
***The truck will be also tricked out with a fresh new paint job ($2000) by none other than DC's finest, Cita Sadeli CHELOVE, and a booming sound system ($800) to keep the party bumpin'.*** 

Print. We are also looking to purchase a Riley Hopkins six-arm two-station press ($1,700). These presses are more industrial, so we can run bigger jobs longer in our print studio. We will need a washout booth ($450) and new table top exposure unit ($395) to ensure the artwork meets our high quality control standards.


Technology. We would like to upgrade our digital equipment with a new inkjet printer with Accurip software ($999), a Macbook pro ($2000) and a two Surface Pro 4 tablets ($700 each). The inkjet printer will move us into the next phase of our screen printing design capabilities. We will be able to offer all-over printing and four-color process printing. The new digital systems will increase our speed and we'll be able to provide high-quality artwork sooner.What You Will Receive in Return

</div><h2>Hello,</h2><div>
</div><p>My name

</div><h2>THE STORY</h2><div>
</div><p>Two
years ago I attended a program under the thematic field “Industrial Archeology’’
at the
National and Kapodistrian University of
Athens. This program offered me theoretical and practical knowledge on the
concept, approach and operation of industrial monuments and brought me into
essential contact with Greece's industrial heritage. It also offered me knowledge
about the basic practices and concepts, concerning the management of industrial
heritage as well as the problem of reusing industrial monuments in modern
times.</p><div>
</div><h2>THE IDEA</h2><div>
</div><p>Since
then, I was thinking of how to set up a company that promotes this unknown
tourist aspect of my country. And makes profit, obviously. I definitely wanted
to learn even more. So, I read specialized books, visited related web-sites and
talked with professionals. </p><p>I
contacted with the managers of the industrial monuments and took part in guide
tours. I even contacted with state actors. I collected information from
anywhere I could have access. In this way I was inspired the idea about
industrial tourism in Greece. An alternative tourism that has not developed adequately
in Greece yet. The cultural heritage is exploited as a resource to attract
visitors-tourists and creating tourist flow in an area. An important aspect of
this is the industrial heritage. It attracts significant direct and indirect
revenues throughout the year successfully and improves the image and reputation
of brownfield sites.</p><div>

My name
is Giannis Tompros and I am 44 years old. I’ m from Greece. I’ve
studied history of European culture at the Open University of Greece.
THE STORY
Two
years ago I attended a program under the thematic field “Industrial Archeology’’

concept, approach and operation of industrial monuments and brought me into
essential contact with Greece's industrial heritage. It also offered me knowledge

heritage as well as the problem of reusing industrial monuments in modern

THE IDEA
Since
then, I was thinking of how to set up a company that promotes this unknown
tourist aspect of my country. And makes profit, obviously. I definitely wanted
to learn even more. So, I read specialized books, visited related web-sites and
talked with professionals. I
contacted with the managers of the industrial monuments and took part in guide

THE REASONS WHY…
After I
appreciated the information and analyzed all the data, I proceeded in creating
the business plan and cost calculation.
Unfortunately
the complete absence of personal sources of funding as well as the
impossibility of financing from banks or other sources at this time in Greece
are the reasons why I ask for your support.
ABOUT COST
Your
contributions will help me to cover the initial cost of the business.
This
includes:

Buying
a used coach of 50 seats: I chose to buy it instead for rent it for two
reasons: greater flexibility and disengagement from trade unions and other
interests.
Rents.
Office
equipment, computerization.
Hiring
6 officials: 1 for office, 2 specialized guides, 1 professional driver, 1
accountant, 1 for outdoor works.
Web-site
construction for information and sales of tourist packages.
Promotion
via internet, magazines, newspapers.
Other
expenses such us taxes, insurances, unexpected losses.

MY AIM
I know the difficulties but I will really try to succeed. To succeed in a challenging, competitive but also
thriving and lucrative sector such as
tourism. I have the vision, I have the plan, I miss the most important, the
financial means. 
Thank you for your time.

<p>I opened Yarncadia in June 2015 after being on JSA for 3 years without a single job interview. Sick of being unemployed, I got a small personal loan and took a risk. So far business has been slow but steady (word to the wise - don't open a LYS in summer!) I believe it is a friendly little shop, happy to help where it can, and I already have a few regular customers.</p>
<p>This campaign is to help the shop reach the next level. I've had lots of people come in for goods I don't stock. There are many crafters around and nowhere local to serve their needs. I'd like Yarncadia to fill that gap.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I need</h3> <p>I need £5000 to cover the following costs</p> <ul> <li>Purchase of an Anchor thread display unit to meet the needs of cross-stitchers and embroiderers.</li> <li>Purchase of a Güitermann
sewing thread display for local sewers</li> <li>Initial orders with King Cole and Stylecraft so I can offer more yarn choice to knitters and crocheters</li>
<li>Initial order with Craft Company for fat quarters and sewing kits</li>

</div></div>","About this campaign Please help me expand a local yarn shop into something wonderfully crafty.
I opened Yarncadia in June 2015 after being on JSA for 3 years without a single job interview. Sick of being unemployed, I got a small personal loan and took a risk. So far business has been slow but steady (word to the wise - don't open a LYS in summer!) I believe it is a friendly little shop, happy to help where it can, and I already have a few regular customers.
This campaign is to help the shop reach the next level. I've had lots of people come in for goods I don't stock. There are many crafters around and nowhere local to serve their needs. I'd like Yarncadia to fill that gap.   What I need I need £5000 to cover the following costs  Purchase of an Anchor thread display unit to meet the needs of cross-stitchers and embroiderers. Purchase of a Güitermann
sewing thread display for local sewers Initial orders with King Cole and Stylecraft so I can offer more yarn choice to knitters and crocheters
Initial order with Craft Company for fat quarters and sewing kits
Purchase of crafting books, patterns and magazines
Advertising the business 
This will open the rear section of the shop to the public while offering greater choice. If I don't reach my goal, then any funding raised will go on the above as far as possible.

</div></div>","Who 

We are a group of creators residing in Grand Rapids Michigan from different fields and backgrounds. Or as the antagonist in your favorite 80s movie would put it...Nerds. 







Why (Local Reason)
We recently lost the film incentives in our state leaving an industry full of passionate and invested people at a loss. We want to to take this and make it an opportunity to create our own sustainable industry that impacts, entertains and effects people and our economy in a positive way.  We can create our own solution that doesn't rely on the unstable ground of warring political parties. We can reignite our own opportunities. Michigan has changed the world before. Why not do it again? 


Why (National Reason)

On a national level, there are some even bigger problems. Dramatic increases in everything but the value of the average worker. We want to change that.






What
Snow Monster Studios will serve as a perpetual local economy growing machine. It will house Education, Open Offices, Production Facilities, Equipment, Apartments and Access to Healthy Food. This will give creatives a platform to produce their own and original content.


This model could be used by any industry to ethically bring a new field into an area anywhere in the U.S. that lifts its residents instead of pushing them out.




Our particular focus will be in media, generating movies, animation, youtube content, virtual reality, video games etc. Our environment will allow for individuals to grow their talents, collaborate, and produce there own work. There will also be official Snow Monster Studios projects such as profit sharing movies.



How

The building is designed to be self sustained through resident rent and green energy. The fixed rent will be priced low enough so that a resident can work a part time job leaving more time to develop their craft and career. Included with rent is access to open offices, equipment, facilities and a rooftop green house. 
We will be offering free classes to low income and affordable classes for everyone else. Mixing students and young professionals in our open offices will lead to impromptu mentorships, collaborations and more. 

Profit Sharing Movies!
Profit sharing movies is a way for the entire crew to benefit from the success of a project. It takes a whole team to make a movie happen, yet a few at the top benefit tremendously while the rest of the crew is severely underpaid. In our system, everyone that works on a movie will receive a percentage of the profits scaled to the skill required for their position.  They will still receive their normal pay, but this also allows everyone to benefit from the success of their hard work.


The Impact! YAY!






Local ImpactWe will be growing a new high paying industry from the ground up along with building a larger specialized talent pool through our training. Businesses plant themselves in cities with larger talent pools. 


One of our internal projects, Profit sharing movies, has the potential to make Michigan industry workers the highest paid in the country. 

National ImpactOnce proven successful, this could be modeled by any industry to ethically introduce new fields into local communities all over the country in a way that benefits those communities instead of displacing them. 
We need your help to build it. 
   What We Need & What You Get
We've been quoted at  1.2 million to build, an additional 195K for land and need roughly 173K for equipment. It's a lot, so we have set our goal at 250K to get us started, but many have raise more, and we hope to keep raising beyond our goal through flex funding.
Our first priority will be to get the equipment for training and producing content. From there it will be securing land in a walkable location. Then getting the facilities built.

Land CostWe want to secure a plot of land in a walkable location. The cost of that land is 195K. 



Facilities Cost1.2 Million

Some of our Perks!


























Risks & Challenges
 We understand that this is a new kind of undertaking, but we have a plan. Our system is set up so that half capacity resident rent will cover all the costs of the building. That way beyond the monthly costs, we can have money saved for any future costs we may incur such as repairs. The more we can raise on here, the cheaper we can keep rent. This model also gives us the freedom to work on creative projects and training.

My goal is to bring a new social enterprise to Lancaster, PA and beyond....
Far Far Away Books is a Mobile Bookstore and Social Enterprise. With a heart for children in low income communities, we sell books on book bikes that all economic backgrounds can afford. Accessibility and affordability are often barriers to reading and Far Far Away hopes to lessen that burden by making quality books both accessible and affordable.I am really passionate about Far Far Away because I believe in the power of reading and the life changing experiences that books can provide to children. It is the basis for all education and allthough i grew up in a low income community, I have personally benefited from having a lifelong love of reading.Donating to this cause can change a child's life. Unfortunately, many families in low income communities can not afford to buy and own books for their children. Far Far Away gives them a chance to do so at prices that they can afford.   
What We Need & What You Get The goal for our campaign is to raise $1100. This money will be used for start up costs as well as to help purchase our first book bike. We also have some really cool perks for every donation you make.
 For every $25 donated, one child will be given a book!
For donations of $50 or above, 3 children will receive a book!
For a donation of $100 or above, 10 children will receive a book in your honor!
For donations of $500, your business can have their name sponsored on the side of our book bike!    The Impact Every donation that you give will help us to put more books in the hands of more children who need them. There are so many benefits to an enterprise like this:

Literacy rates and reading proficiency scores are more likely to go up if we are able to help more kids read. Making books accessible on book bikes helps us to keep overhead costs low, to be closer to children in their actual neighborhoods and to show kids that reading can not only be fun but a large part of their lives.

Source: http://www.brobible.com/life/article/13159255-which-brobible-reader-can-build-largest-beer-can-pyramid-10-minute/


Now, the US is #1 at everything in the world. Especially in drinking beer. So in light of the recent victories over German and Japan (sound familiar?) lets lock in another against the Aussies. The problem is simple and so is the solution. Build a larger and better beeramid. 

The beeramid will be constructed on July 18th, in Providence, Rhode Island. If you are in the area, we would love for you to participate in being an American. It will be constructed on the top of a parking garage just south of Brown University's campus.


   Here are the numbers: The US standard can is 4.83 inches tall. To beat 16 feet the beeramid will need 40 layers of cans. But why stop there? Just 1 more beer...
With 50 layers, the beeramid will be 20 feet tall and it will be comprised of 2500 beers. Does America have to stop there? Nope. 
The money raised will be equivalent to the number of cans acquired.
Our goal is to build it as tall as we are funded. More $ = more height. The more impressive it is, the more likely the Guinness World Records will accept the submission proposal.
Can we do it?

If you donate just $1 to the cause, your name will be added to a list of backers that strive to make the US the best country in the world to live in. 

If you think America can't do it then I invite you to leave this beautiful, land of freedom and rethink your actions.







Spread the Word
If you can't contribute, that's fine. But that doesn't mean you can't help. Tell your beer loving friends and spread the word.

trip...but with a twist. I want to stop at various locations and perform
 good deeds for the fandom family. They've given so much to me, and I've
 seen so many people struggle, that I just have to give back.<br/> The 
ideal: travel across the country performing good deeds to as many fandom
 family members as possible. I'd like to hit at least three people. Who 
will I choose? I want to take nominations--you can nominate yourself,
 a friend, or someone you've never met. What will I do? You can choose 
what you want to happen or let me (or should I say, us, since the family
 has overwhelmed me with their desire to help!) decide. Maybe a 
financially-strapped friend has always wanted to go to a convention. 
Maybe a single mother needs a day off. Maybe you know someone who is 
sick but can't afford medicine. No limits to what we hope to do!<br/> The
 alternative: if traveling ends up not being financially possible, I 
want to be able to at least send personalized gifts to everyone who 
needs it. Sometimes, all a person needs is knowing someone cares. This 
idea might include some Supernatural merch, a gift certificate to a 
favorite store, a card from the family...the only qualification is that 
it must be personal and meaningful to them, something that helps with 
their specific problem.<br/> Just so you know, any money raised will go

<h3>Green Tree Project</h3>
<p>As a foster mom in Oklahoma City, I am passionate about family. Green Tree Project is a business that will enhance the magic of family celebrations at Christmas by supplying living, potted trees for people to decorate and use as the cornerstone of their holiday traditions. </p>
<p>In addition to living Christmas tree rental, Green Tree Project will also offer a Grow With Me Tree Subscription. Families can subscribe to a seedling tree and receive that same tree year after year. Our trees grow at a rate of 2 to 3 feet per year, so before long families will have large, mature trees for the same subscription rate. Families will receive postcards and notes from their trees throughout the year in addition to an invitation to our Christmas in July party. </p>
<p>Green Tree Project is an eco-friendly option for Christmas. Beyond that, as a business that is owned and operated by a local foster family, it is a socially conscious option. We will provide free delivery and pick up for any local foster families who rent or subscribe to a Christmas tree. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Campaign Goals (and how we plan to thank you!)</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>We are seeking $10,000 in our Fund the Forest campaign. We will use this funding primarily in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>To secure a brick and mortar location: Right now Green Tree Project is being operated out of our home, but we want to expand and rent trees to as many families, foster families, businesses and churches as possible. </li>
<li>To increase our potted tree forest: We would like to offer more species of trees in more sizes to our deserving clients. </li>
<li>Most importantly, to support foster families: We will rent trees to foster families with no delivery or pick up fees. Foster families tend to be pressed for time and energy, and funds raised will go to support these families by taking a major logistical issue for Christmas off their hands. </li>
</ol>
<p>There are perks to supporting our Fund the Forest campaign! From sending a personalized note to a foster family to naming a tree to free lighting and delivery on tree rentals, we are ready to spoil our supporters! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a dream project for our family. We can't imagine something more meaningful than sharing a joyful, impactful tradition in homes, businesses and churches across the Oklahoma City Metro. We're excited to mail postcards to our clients from their trees year round to increase the sense of wonder and awe for the holidays. Thank you for your support in bringing this dream to life. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>There are some challenges in this business, and we are aware that numerous small businesses fail in their first years. However, we believe people will find this service as magical and helpful as we do. We are committed to this business and prepared to take on any challenge. </p>

</div><p></p><p></p><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>We are Baruti and Denise Tucker, owners of Humanitree House. We launched Humanitree House in 2014, as a COMPLETELY self funded grass roots effort.  We started with no loans, no savings, no investors and we took a risk to bring healthy cold pressed juices and vegan food to an underserved area that lacks these options. Currently, we are the ONLY cold pressed, organic, vegan juice bar in the area.  In addition, we are the ONLY African centered Art Gallery in the Augusta, Georgia area.  Augusta DOES have the Laney Walker Musuem of Black History; however, we are the only independent Art Gallery that features a diversity of African centered art. </p><p>We decided to launch this campaign to reach out to the global community at large to help us stay open. We are looking for 5,000 or more people with $5 to donate to a worthy effort. Because we launched independently, we depend on day to day operations to even open the next day. This doesn't allow for inventory or needed equipment and repairs to remain fully operational. In addition, it doesn't allow for us to provide jobs to our youth in the area that may need it. Currently, we are at a critical place where we have no reserve and are facing the possibility of closing our doors.  <i><b>We appreciate you prayers as well!! </b></i></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><i> </i></b>The kindness of all of you that have </span><b style=""background-color: initial;""><i>ALREADY helped</i></b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> and those that haven't but are willing to help can change this dire situation. Nobody likes having to ask for money; however this is a time where we really need your help. So please...no matter the amount, anything you can contribute, myself, my husband, our family AND the community of Augusta will be truly grateful. </span><br/></p><p>We are asking for <b><i>5,000 people or more with $5  (just $5) </i></b>to help us reach our goal to remain operational.  Your gift will keep a vital resource open in this community. We are already 30% to our original $20,000 goal with the first campaign. </p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>We need $20,000.00. It will help us to replace equipment that is vital to our operation. In addition, expand our reach and community programs to reach a broader audience.</li>
<li>The perks are amazing from JUICE, to Veggie Burgers, to Store Credit, to ART to HUGS.  Our out of town backers will receive a Humanitree House Tshirt for any donation over $20.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, we will use the funds raised to take care of some of the needed resources.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p> It's vital that our businesses stay in our community. Many of them close due to lack of support.  We have a strong support system, however, we need more resources. As you are aware traditional funding, loans and bank financing is not as easily accessible to small businesses as they may be to retail chains. </p><p>Local businesses give a community its flavor. Cities everywhere have similar chain restaurants, grocery and department stores but that juice bar downtown where you have your morning smoothie is one-of-a-kind. The combined presence local businesses will make a city different from every other place in the world. By supporting our business you ensure that uniqueness is preserved as a part of the global as well as the Augusta community.</p><p><b>THE RISKS: </b>We want to remain open. The only RISK is closing because we can't reach our goal or close enough to the goal.  WE have the customer base to keep us operational. BUT we don't have the resources to keep us healthy as a business. We can't continue to risk our family to keep the doors open. </p><p><b><i>THE GREAT RISK we expect is that WE take AUGUSTA by storm, continue a universal space where LOVE, CREATIVITY and HOPE remains!</i></b></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p><ul>
<li>Please share this campaign with those you feel can support or get the word out!  </li>
<li>Send someone down to Humanitree House in Augusta to purchase a juice or smoothie!</li>
</ul><p>Our remaining goal is $ 15,000. Peace &amp; Blessings !</p><p>Thank you for taking your time in reading this and your help is much appreciated.  Much love, peace, and blessing to you all,</p><p></p></div>","Short SummaryWe are Baruti and Denise Tucker, owners of Humanitree House.

We need $20,000.00. It will help us to replace equipment that is vital to our operation. In addition, expand our reach and community programs to reach a broader audience.
The perks are amazing from JUICE, to Veggie Burgers, to Store Credit, to ART to HUGS.  Our out of town backers will receive a Humanitree House Tshirt for any donation over $20.
If we don't reach our goal, we will use the funds raised to take care of some of the needed resources.
The Impact It's vital that our businesses stay in our community. Many of them close due to lack of support.  We have a strong support system, however, we need more resources. As you are aware traditional funding, loans and bank financing is not as easily accessible to small businesses as they may be to retail chains. Local businesses give a community its flavor. Cities everywhere have similar chain restaurants, grocery and department stores but that juice bar downtown where you have your morning smoothie is one-of-a-kind. The combined presence local businesses will make a city different from every other place in the world. By supporting our business you ensure that uniqueness is preserved as a part of the global as well as the Augusta community.THE RISKS: We want to remain open. The only RISK is closing because we can't reach our goal or close enough to the goal.  WE have the customer base to keep us operational. BUT we don't have the resources to keep us healthy as a business. We can't continue to risk our family to keep the doors open. THE GREAT RISK we expect is that WE take AUGUSTA by storm, continue a universal space where LOVE, CREATIVITY and HOPE remains!Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Please share this campaign with those you feel can support or get the word out!  
Send someone down to Humanitree House in Augusta to purchase a juice or smoothie!
Our remaining goal is $ 15,000. Peace & Blessings !Thank you for taking your time in reading this and your help is much appreciated.  Much love, peace, and blessing to you all,",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

</p>
<p><b>OUR WHY:</b></p>
<p>We love coffee.  We want to
build a future for our family here in Fresno.  We would love to bring a community coffee bar here to Fresno, and make it a place where you can gather with friends, come here to get inspired, or just relax in a fun space and drink a really good cup of coffee. </p>
<p>We relocated here to Fresno from the Orange
County, CA area.  After being here for a short time we quickly realized we wanted to set down some roots and make this our home.  But most importantly, Steve and I want to
create something amazing here, and to build a legacy for our son Elik.  Since the
day we dreamed up our little guy, we’ve always promised one another to give Elik the most amazing future and to build him something that he can one day call his own. Rove Wild is that something.</p>
<p>Here's a little about Steve and
I.  Both of our fathers were Marines, stationed on the Tustin Military Base in California.  We were next-door neighbors.  Our moms were friends, our siblings hung out
and played together, and we were teenagers when we started dating.  <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Having moved quite a bit as young kids, and exploring Orange County, Los Angeles, and Tucson, AZ as adults, we bring some great and interesting experiences with us. We both love to travel, seek out new places to eat, and especially like trying new coffee shops.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Combined, Steve and I bring experience working in the food, corporate, and small business worlds.  Steve has experience working for a sandwich chain as a manager and really enjoyed working in the food industry.  He had an opportunity to work part-time for FedEx 20 years ago to make some extra money, and he never left. He's been a courier with FedEx ever since, and also drives for Uber and Lyft during the weekends.   I have years of experience working in the corporate world as an IT buyer and supply chain coordinator, and after my position was outsourced to India I decided to go back to school and get my AA in Fashion Design.  After graduating from the Art Institute of Tucson I focused on working with and supporting smaller businesses.  This is really where I learned the most valuable lessons and information, and this is what I plan to use to help us bring Rove Wild to life.</span></p>
<p>Hit the forward button, and here we are celebrating 13 years of marriage, and we have a very rambunctious toddler keeping us oh-so-very entertained.  How grateful are we!  <br/></p>
<p><b>THE PLAN</b></p>
<p>Our goal is to build a place where
the community can come together, use some free Wi-Fi <i>(because that's a must)</i>, meet with friends, or have a business meeting.  Our roaster is Pachamama Coffee Cooperative, they are the only
coffee company in the USA that is 100% owned and governed by farmers in Peru,
Nicaragua, Guatemala, Mexico, and Ethiopia.  The coffee is absolutely
amazing, and we cannot wait to share it with the Fresno community.</p>
<p>Handcrafted is always better.  To really enjoy all the amazing flavor that
each coffee bean has to offer, we believe you must take a few extra minutes. We
will be serving Pachamama coffee pour over style, brewed cold or hot whatever
you prefer, and the coffee offerings will change seasonally.  Of course we will also offer espresso drinks or whatever coffee drink you want to dream up.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">For those that are not coffee
drinkers we will offer tea and unique in-house sodas.  Our pastries and baked goods will be locally
sourced from local chefs and bakers that will also change seasonally. Supporting local is so important to us!</span></p>

This seemingly regret filled advice is given in what seems like so many parents desperate attempt at hoping that their children will not have to fall into the same 9-5, emotionally (and, so many times, financially) unfulfilling grind of ""working for the man.""<br/><br/>Alas, no matter how many times we hear those same little quips, no matter how many inspirational quotes we read and no matter how hard the tears of their importance and truth fight to break free of the stronghold of our eyes, so many of us put our dreams on hold until we can ""afford"" it...but sometimes that idea of foundation that we cling to seems to crumble at the same time it is being built. You know the story...you save a little and then your car breaks down; you save a little and then your dog gets a face full of porcupine; you save a little and you save a little and you save a little and then, somehow, you are fifty years old and telling your grand children to follow their dreams. <br/><br/>So here I am, a twenty seven year old mother of an amazing fifteen month old boy; a loving and supportive partner to a loving and supporting man; a girl trying to make a living by doing something she truly loves. <br/><br/>I would love to say that I have known for ever what exactly my dream was (and I guess now that I think of it, I kind of always have, but we will get back to that in a moment) but I didn't. A few years ago, I couldn't tell you what I was passionate about, let alone would I have been able to dream up a way to turn -passion- into what I did for a living. I thought I was stuck in the 9-5 world and that's just the way life worked if you didn't pursue higher education, didn't have money or opted out of joining the Peace Corps.  I have gone from job to job with a smile on my face, though<br/> not always in my heart, because I knew that it was what I needed to do. Some days I really loved it, being the eternal optimist that I am, I had found my niche in Customer Service. Something about working with people and having that chance to share a moment of each others lives together and to help bring a little bit of my sunny-side of life outlook into their days really made me happy. It still does make me happy, but when those moments are over and I begin to think about the time and effort I put into creating that experience for someone elses dream, I am left feeling a little bit empty inside. <br/><br/>It was when I realized these feelings that I really started to ponder what -exactly- I wanted to do with my life. It was then that those tears of truth began to bubble under the surface, threatening to escape when I encountered people living their dream. It was then that those tears did escape when I met people taking the risk to do what they believed in. It was then that I began to think about passion. <br/><br/>I read once that a good place to start to gain an understanding about what may or may not be your passion is to return to your childhood. It is in those un-jaded years of our youth that we truly loved without the burden of societies ideas of right and wrong. What was it that I loved as a child?Books, baths and most of all, reading books while taking a bath. While it sounds a little silly, there was seriously nothing I loved more than taking a ridiculously long bath (sometimes re-filling the tub two or three times) and escaping into some fantastical landscape (mostly Hogwarts...okay almost ALWAYS Hogwarts) where I didn't have to worry about the realities of life.<br/><br/>So, when I thought about what I love about being a part of the work force today, the life style that I live and my childhood (and forever) love of a way too long bath, Laughing Fox Botanicals was born. I came to the conclusion that I could make a product that not only encourages people to stop bombarding their body with the ridiculous amounts of dangerous chemicals that are put into today's bath and body products, but more importantly encourages them to SLOW DOWN and take a moment to remember to love yourself.<br/><br/>I want to take this moment to thank you.

<li><h3>Who We Are</h3></li>
</ul> <p>Dorr to Eden is a family hobby farm in Dorr, Michigan. We combine the unique practice of naturopathy and psychodynamic counseling using animals. We are offering a place for children to find healing by reconnecting with animals, nature and themselves. </p>
<ul><li>Equine assisted therapy uses the natural instincts of the horse, a prey animal, to bring awareness to the client's emotions. The horse has a very heightened sense of human emotions because of their need to be conscious of anything that feels unstable in their environment. Their mirror neurons responds to anxiety, depression, or fear that is present and the client. This will then make space for the client to learn ways to reduce their uncomfortable emotions and watch how the horse also relaxes. </li></ul>By following the principals laid out in EAGALA (Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association), Angela and Tracy can explore non-traditional pathways to healing.</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459475822/ANGELA_PROFILE_vyo1eq.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 133.4px;height: 120px;""/></p>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Angela McElroy</strong><span style=""line-height: 21px;""> BSHS,  Doctor Naturopathy- Angela has worked in Infant mental health as a social worker for 10 years.  Angela observed a need for educating parents in holistic health as well as a increase in nature deficiency so she pursued her certification as a doctor of naturopathy and continued her education in herbal studies.  She recognized that when children become diagnosed at a younger age with ADHD, Anxiety, Depression and chronic anger; they become disconnected with society and themselves due to overuse of technology, and lack of outdoor play. Angela's passion is to reconnect children through truer healing and peace of mind.</span>

<p><strong>Tracy Thompson</strong> LPC Child and Family Therapist- believes that childhood can be a time of happiness, joy and excitement. For others it can be a time of disappointment, confusion and pain.  Tracy has been in the mental health field for 10 years and specializes in working with children and families who have discovered that life can be a tough journey. By using animals and nature rather than a traditional office setting children are released to explore healing through non-judgmental playful connection.  Tracy loves to help children learn about how their body is communicating with them through their feelings and helping them to listen and develop tools to help them manage these ""big"" feelings. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;"">Why it Matters</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Offering this space and treatment to kids, who have not had success in the traditional settings, can give parents and children hope that healing is possible.  When children are forced to function in an environment that limits their ability to express themselves they feel the need to protect themselves by shutting down. When they are out in nature and in connection with animals,  they feel comfortable, and free to fully express there true selves.  </span>
</li>
<li>Using animals in healing has been shown to provide a quicker process towards healing. Dorr to Eden will expand that by joining together two modalities to create a space where healing can begin. </li>
<li>When children are facing disconnection in their relationships, trauma, school problems, health issues or other points of conflict, there is limited capacity for them to navigate their world very well. This place will provide them with tools and support to assist them in being able to take steps towards wholeness. </li>
<li>Being outside taps into the relaxing side of the nervous system, and results can be seen in as little as 5 minutes.
  During this outside time anxiety and depression can be relieved and happiness can begin again.</li>
</ul>
<div>When you support Dorr to Eden you support a holistic mindful model of healing and connection. We believe that we are beings created to move towards wholeness and with the right support and tools people are more likely to have healthy lives. Your support allows you to be part of an innovative way for children and families to gain the resources they need to become happy, healthy and whole!</div> </div> <div> </div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><div>
</div><p>The great news is we have the property, animals, education and the passion to make this happen.

</div></div>","Who We Are
 Dorr to Eden is a family hobby farm in Dorr, Michigan. We combine the unique practice of naturopathy and psychodynamic counseling using animals. We are offering a place for children to find healing by reconnecting with animals, nature and themselves. 
Equine assisted therapy uses the natural instincts of the horse, a prey animal, to bring awareness to the client's emotions. The horse has a very heightened sense of human emotions because of their need to be conscious of anything that feels unstable in their environment. Their mirror neurons responds to anxiety, depression, or fear that is present and the client. This will then make space for the client to learn ways to reduce their uncomfortable emotions and watch how the horse also relaxes. By following the principals laid out in EAGALA (Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association), Angela and Tracy can explore non-traditional pathways to healing.
  Angela McElroy BSHS,  Doctor Naturopathy- Angela has worked in Infant mental health as a social worker for 10 years.  Angela observed a need for educating parents in holistic health as well as a increase in nature deficiency so she pursued her certification as a doctor of naturopathy and continued her education in herbal studies.  She recognized that when children become diagnosed at a younger age with ADHD, Anxiety, Depression and chronic anger; they become disconnected with society and themselves due to overuse of technology, and lack of outdoor play. Angela's passion is to reconnect children through truer healing and peace of mind.



Tracy Thompson LPC Child and Family Therapist- believes that childhood can be a time of happiness, joy and excitement. For others it can be a time of disappointment, confusion and pain.  Tracy has been in the mental health field for 10 years and specializes in working with children and families who have discovered that life can be a tough journey. By using animals and nature rather than a traditional office setting children are released to explore healing through non-judgmental playful connection.  Tracy loves to help children learn about how their body is communicating with them through their feelings and helping them to listen and develop tools to help them manage these ""big"" feelings. 
Why it Matters


Offering this space and treatment to kids, who have not had success in the traditional settings, can give parents and children hope that healing is possible.  When children are forced to function in an environment that limits their ability to express themselves they feel the need to protect themselves by shutting down. When they are out in nature and in connection with animals,  they feel comfortable, and free to fully express there true selves.  

Using animals in healing has been shown to provide a quicker process towards healing. Dorr to Eden will expand that by joining together two modalities to create a space where healing can begin. 
When children are facing disconnection in their relationships, trauma, school problems, health issues or other points of conflict, there is limited capacity for them to navigate their world very well. This place will provide them with tools and support to assist them in being able to take steps towards wholeness. 
Being outside taps into the relaxing side of the nervous system, and results can be seen in as little as 5 minutes.
  During this outside time anxiety and depression can be relieved and happiness can begin again.

When you support Dorr to Eden you support a holistic mindful model of healing and connection. We believe that we are beings created to move towards wholeness and with the right support and tools people are more likely to have healthy lives. Your support allows you to be part of an innovative way for children and families to gain the resources they need to become happy, healthy and whole!   What We Need & What You Get
The great news is we have the property, animals, education and the passion to make this happen. Good works are taking root.We are looking for your support to renovate an indoor work space for shelter when weather is bad. As you could see in the clip,  the garage out front is in need of a do- over, by adding this addition it will allow space for the children to participate indoors.  Also privacy fencing is needed around the front  pasture where sessions will be held. This funding will also help with the up front insurance fees for liability for clients and Dorr To Eden. Our timing is limited as the official opening date is September 1st 2016,  we would like to  have a website up and running by the end of June and offer  open houses during the month of August.
We are excited to offer these perks that have a connection to out space here on the farm, from the mindful heart connection to the nature connection. 
Beyond giving, we would love for your help to get the word out to friends and family about this service.  This could look like:
Sharing this page to raise out goal

The Impact Well grounded individuals are a benefit to society as a whole.  Community, schools and parents all benefit when youth are respectful and grounded in nature because they feel physically and mentally whole.  When we encourage youth to love and respect nature and animals it teaches them to love and respect themselves, which will translate to gratitude and love for others. 
More potential out comes would look like...
Lower negative behaviorsDeeper connection to familiesHigher sense of personal responsibilityHigh sense of self awareness and self esteem

</div><p><b>The Project:</b></p>
<p>Our primary purpose is to bring
good cheer to our community through outstanding beer produced in Statesville's
first brewery. We envision 1789 Brewery &amp; Taphouse as a comfortable gathering
spot for all to enjoy delicious, handcrafted beer in a welcoming environment. A
cozy beer garden will be the perfect outdoor setting to enjoy our warm southern
climate.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Beer:</b></p>
<p>With a focus on quality over
quantity, we will use the finest ingredients available to produce an
exceptional product. All of our beer is handcrafted with care and held to the
highest standards. </p>
<p>Flavorful, refreshing, unfiltered
deliciousness created fresh for you to enjoy straight from the source. The
beers in our Signature Collection are classic styles, rooted in European
tradition, crafted with American flair. The line-up includes, but is not
limited to, an American IPA, a Tart Gose or Berliner Wiesse, an English Pale Ale, an Irish Stout, a German
Golden Lager, a Czech Dark Lager, a Belgian Wit, and a Hefeweizen. </p>
<p>We plan to have 6 of our Signature
Collection beers on tap at all times, but we also love experimenting with new
flavors and brewing fun, eccentric beers. A constant rotation of seasonal
specialties, barrel-aged projects, collaborations, and experimental batches of
our own will be among the 20 different choices featured in the 1789 Taphouse.</p>
<p>It is important for us to host a
wide variety of local and international guest taps, so we always have an
appealing beverage available for everyone. Hard cider, kombucha, sparkling soda,
and cold-pressed coffee will also be on hand for gluten-free and alcohol-free
options. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Homebrew Supply:</b></p>
<p>There is a
definite void in the homebrew supply market in our area. Local homebrewers need
access to ingredients and equipment without going out of town, ordering online,
or worrying that the store is closed when they need a last minute item. We plan
to have a small homebrew supply shop connected to the Taphouse to give
homebrewers the option to shop locally.  </p>
<p><b>Community Enrichment:</b></p>
<p>1789 Brewery &amp; Taphouse will be
the first of its kind in historic Statesville.
Our goal is to not only build a successful business for ourselves, but to run
an organization that will benefit our community as a whole. We will play a
fundamental role in the continued revitalization and growth of our city,
bringing in new jobs and attracting other businesses to the area. We look
forward to sponsoring established community events and creating other
civic-minded events of our own. We will also help develop and organize
educational courses for those interested in learning more about beer and the
brewing process. </p>
<p>We would love to see 1789 become a
beer destination and put Statesville on every beer traveler's map. At the
crossroads of I-77 &amp; I-40, Statesville is the perfect pit stop for
travelers heading to and from the popular beer destinations of Asheville,
Raleigh, and Charlotte. Thanks to our beautifully renovated downtown
streetscape, a greenway that rivals any large city, and a dog park project
underway, Statesville has just been named Tree City USA and is an even lovelier
place to work and play.  </p>
<p><b>Community Tap:</b></p>
<p>We plan to give back to our
community by joining forces with local charities and donating all profits from
one specially designated tap, the Community Tap. Every quarter, the winner of
our charity raffle will get to choose their favorite local charity as well as
have a say in the beer that is served from the Community Tap. Profits from the
Community Tap for the next three months will be given to the charity of
choice.   </p>
<p><b>Why 1789?</b></p>
<p>We chose the name 1789 Brewing
Company for its historical significance and unique simplicity. In 1789, the
Iredell County settlement known as Fourth Creek Congregation was officially
renamed Statesville. 1789 is the year the Province of North Carolina became the
12th state to join the Union. North Carolina University, now known as UNC - Chapel
Hill, received its charter in 1789. George Washington's Presidential
inauguration was held on April 30, 1789. We could go on, but that would spoil
the fun, as we plan to use these historical facts in our beer names!  </p>

<p>Wondering what the heck is a fermenter? A
fermenter is a large stainless steel tank where yeast turns wort (water, malt,
and hops) into beer through a process called fermentation. Ales typically take
21 days to ferment, while lagers take even longer. Fermenters are the most
important components of the brewery. The more fermenters, the better, so we can
ferment a good variety of beers at the same time.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462068834/7bbl_Fermenter_rttiz7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges:</b></p><p>Of course there are risks involved when starting any new business venture. Adequate funding is essential to the success of 1789 Brewing Company. Most of the building renovations will be done ourselves, but we will eventually have to hire contractors.

Wondering what the heck is a fermenter? A
fermenter is a large stainless steel tank where yeast turns wort (water, malt,
and hops) into beer through a process called fermentation. Ales typically take
21 days to ferment, while lagers take even longer. Fermenters are the most
important components of the brewery. The more fermenters, the better, so we can
ferment a good variety of beers at the same time.Risks & Challenges:Of course there are risks involved when starting any new business venture. Adequate funding is essential to the success of 1789 Brewing Company. Most of the building renovations will be done ourselves, but we will eventually have to hire contractors. Shipping delays will most likely be an issue. Acquiring the proper licenses will probably involve yards of government red tape. While running a brewery sounds like a lot of fun, it is also very labor intensive. Lucky for us, brewing beer is our passion, so the hard work is a genuine labor of love. We realize we will have to jump through many hoops before our doors open to the public, but we shall overcome! And we welcome you along for the ride.Thank you in advance for your generosity and support. We will keep you updated periodically with our progress. Other Ways You Can Help:We understand if you do not have the monetary means to help. That's OK. There are other ways you can lend a hand in getting this venture off the ground.1. Use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word to your social media circle2. Talk to your friends and family the old-fashioned way3. Follow us on Facebook and Twitter4. Share the craft beer love!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

At a more ambitious level, it creates a virtuous dynamic in which whatever good happens in a section of the city becomes visible and enviable for other parts of the city to emulate. Similarly, whatever bad is reported in a neighborhood becomes known to other neighborhoods to avoid. The result is simple but powerful: a digital platform facilitating awareness of city issues, to drive a virtuous cycle of learn, engage and actuate which makes our cities more livable, serviceable and governable. CITIVIVA aspires to be ""The Front Page of MIAMI community life"".</a></p><p><a href=""#Espa%C3%B1ol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self""> </a></p><p><a href=""#Espa%C3%B1ol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self""> </a></p><p><a href=""#Espa%C3%B1ol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">Accordingly, <strong>CITIVIVA</strong> provides an App through which Miami citizens tell what they like and dislike about living in their city. Better yet, the App allows other people to vote up or down your likes or dislikes about living in Miami as well as posting their comments about them.  This simple but important dynamic results in an engaging atmosphere that enhances the sense of community and belonging among Miami citizens.</a></p><p><a href=""#Espa%C3%B1ol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self""> </a></p><p><a href=""#Espa%C3%B1ol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">But <strong>CITIVIVA</strong> is much more than a simple App to praise or complain. Our App is tied to a cloud platform that stores, organizes and displays all of the issues posted by its members. Thus, anybody who cares about Miami can see the topics or issues of interest to its citizens. They can be community organizations, colleges and universities, the chamber of commerce, local media, service companies and local government officials. And they can use the information to propose innovative solutions, which will enhance the quality of life in the city.</a></p><p><a href=""#Espa%C3%B1ol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self""> </a></p><p><a href=""#Espa%C3%B1ol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">We have already invested our own funds in developing and piloting our Civic Engagement Platform, so that it can be effectively deployed in medium to large American cities.

The money will be used as follows:</a></p><p><a href=""#Espa%C3%B1ol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">Apps development and technology costs:    20%</a></p><p><a href=""#Espa%C3%B1ol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">Marketing and launching costs:                   29%</a></p><p><a href=""#Espa%C3%B1ol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">Awareness towards an engagement culture:         14%</a></p><p><a href=""#Espa%C3%B1ol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">Neighborhood and community workshops:   11%</a></p><p><a href=""#Espa%C3%B1ol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">Administrative and general expenses:                  26%</a></p><p><a href=""#Espa%C3%B1ol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self""> </a></p><p><a href=""#Espa%C3%B1ol"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">For us, the experience gained during our pilot trial at Montevideo provided us with important lessons learned that we intend to use during our deployment in Miami.

</div><p><a name=""Español"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p></div>","Para Español oprima aquí OUR STORY  My name is Angelica Alvaray, as a professional I have gone from being an Engineer with an MBA at Henley Management College in London to becoming a Social Entrepreneur on a mission to develop a wonderful startup: CITIVIVA. We, as people, are ever less engaged in fundamental affairs which affect our quality of living: life is moving faster than ever in a technology driven world and civic engagement drags along like a snail to the detriment of city life for all.  Thus, CITIVIVA was born: to give civic engagement a fighting chance and an opportunity to catch up with the realities of a digital world. At a very basic level, CITIVIVA is an information and awareness social platform, which puts a stop to the pernicious trend of civic disengagement and neglect. At a more ambitious level, it creates a virtuous dynamic in which whatever good happens in a section of the city becomes visible and enviable for other parts of the city to emulate. Similarly, whatever bad is reported in a neighborhood becomes known to other neighborhoods to avoid. The result is simple but powerful: a digital platform facilitating awareness of city issues, to drive a virtuous cycle of learn, engage and actuate which makes our cities more livable, serviceable and governable. CITIVIVA aspires to be ""The Front Page of MIAMI community life"".  Accordingly, CITIVIVA provides an App through which Miami citizens tell what they like and dislike about living in their city. Better yet, the App allows other people to vote up or down your likes or dislikes about living in Miami as well as posting their comments about them.  This simple but important dynamic results in an engaging atmosphere that enhances the sense of community and belonging among Miami citizens. But CITIVIVA is much more than a simple App to praise or complain. Our App is tied to a cloud platform that stores, organizes and displays all of the issues posted by its members. Thus, anybody who cares about Miami can see the topics or issues of interest to its citizens. They can be community organizations, colleges and universities, the chamber of commerce, local media, service companies and local government officials. And they can use the information to propose innovative solutions, which will enhance the quality of life in the city. We have already invested our own funds in developing and piloting our Civic Engagement Platform, so that it can be effectively deployed in medium to large American cities. Our current objective is to prove CITIVIVA viable in Miami as the first American city. For CITIVIVA to be fully deployed in Miami, we need US$ 450.000, a part of which is being funded by us and our Angel Investors. The money will be used as follows:Apps development and technology costs:    20%Marketing and launching costs:                   29%Awareness towards an engagement culture:         14%Neighborhood and community workshops:   11%Administrative and general expenses:                  26% For us, the experience gained during our pilot trial at Montevideo provided us with important lessons learned that we intend to use during our deployment in Miami. The most important one is to recruit, early on, existing citizen organizations and institutions and ""install"" them within the Citizen Social Network, so they can leverage it to better organize and reach their existing constituencies, as well as to grow new ones. Therefore our initial marketing efforts will be totally focused on these targets. The other most important lesson is the use of the mobile apps to enhance user experience. This is already defined and waiting for the funding to commence. As you can see, your contribution is valuable not only for the money you bring, but for the enthusiasm it provides in spreading the message in our communities that now is easier then ever to become engaged in the betterment of our city. CITIVIVA is here for people like you who care about the city we live in.   With your help and participation we can, together, make this happen. After all, our everyday life matters!   

 
 
NUESTRA HISTORIA

 
Mi nombre es Angélica Alvaray. Mi vida profesional me ha llevado de ser ingeniero con un MBA de la escuela de gerencia de negocios del Henley Management College en Londres, a convertirme en una Emprendedora Social dedicada al desarrollo de una iniciativa maravillosa: CITIVIVA.
 
Como personas, estamos cada vez menos envueltos en temas fundamentales que afectan nuestra calidad de vida: nuestra vida se mueve cada vez más rápido en un mundo empujado por la tecnología mientras que la participación ciudadana se mueve a paso de tortuga en detrimento de la calidad de vida de nuestras ciudades.
 
Por esto nace CITIVIVA: para darle a la participación ciudadana un chance de ponerse al día con las realidades de este mundo digital en el que vivimos.
 
A un nivel básico, CITIVIVA es una plataforma social de información y participación ciudadana cuyo objetivo es detener el círculo pernicioso de desidia y abandono cívico. A un nivel más ambicioso, crea una dinámica virtuosa dentro de la cual cualquier cosa buena que suceda en una parte de la ciudad pueda ser visualizable y envidiable para que el resto de la ciudad la emule. Igualmente, cualquier suceso o tendencia negativa en una sección de la ciudad se hace visible al resto de la ciudad para ser combatida o evitada. El resultado es simple pero poderoso: tener disponible al alcance de nuestro dedos una plataforma digital que facilite estar al tanto de los asuntos vitales de la ciudad, auspiciando un círculo virtuoso de informarse, opinar  y actuar que haga nuestra ciudad más vivible, serviciable y gobernable. CITIVIVA aspira a convertirse en ""La portada de la vida ciudadana de MIAMI""
 
 
En consecuencia, CITIVIVA provee una App a través de la cual los ciudadanos de Miami pueden publicar lo que les gusta y no les gusta de su ciudad. Mejor aún, nuestra App le permite a otras personas votar en apoyo o en contra de tu opinion al mismo tiempo que les permite opinar sobre ella. Esta dinámica sencilla pero importante, estimula una atmósfera de participación que realza el sentido de comunidad y de pertenencia entre los ciudadanos del área metropolitana de Miami.
 
Pero CITIVIVA es mucho más que una simple App para aplaudir o protestar. Nuestra App está integrada con una plataforma social en la nube que almacena, organiza y presenta todos los asuntos creados por sus miembros. Así, cualquiera a quién le importe Miami, puede ver los tópicos o asuntos que de interés para sus ciudadanos. Esto aplica organizaciones comunitarias, colleges y universidades, cámara de comercio, medios de información, empresas de servicio y oficiales del gobierno local. Todos pueden utilizar la información disponible para proponer o implementar soluciones innovadoras que realzen la calidad de vida de la cuidad.
 
Los fundadores de esta iniciativa han invertido de sus propios fondos en el desarrollo y pruebas de la plataforma de participación ciudadana, de manera que pueda ser utilizada effectivamente en ciudades norteamericanas medianas y grandes. Nuestro objetivo inmediato es probar la viabilidad de CITIVIVA en Miami como su primera instalación en los Estados Unidos.
 
Para ""instalar"" CITIVIVA en Miami, requerimos de un total de $450,000, parte de los cuales serán provistos por nuestros Inversionistas Ángeles y el resto por ustedes. Los fondos serán empleados de esta manera:
 
Desarrollo y tecnología:                            20%
Mercadeo and lanzamiento:                        29%
Promoción de cultura de participación:        14%
Talleres de educación y promoción:            11%
Gastos administrativos y de ventas:            26%
 
La experiencia que adquirimos durante nuestro piloto en Montevideo nos dejó importantes lecciones que utilizaremos durante nuestra ""instalación"" en Miami. La más importante es incorporar organizaciones civicas así como instituciones para integrarlas dentro de nuestra Red Social Ciudadana y que puedan utilizarla como su ""Sede Digital"" para optimizar su alcance al público al cual de dedican, pero tambien a nuevos públicos. De manera que nuestros esfuerzos iniciales de mercadeo estarán centrados en estos ""targets"". Otra lección importante que aprendimos es diseñar efectivamente nuestras Apps móviles para realzar la experiencia de nuestro usuarios.
 
Como puedes ver, tu contribución (no importa su monto) vale no solo por el aporte financiero que nos provee, sino tambien por la demostración de entusiasmo que representa y nos ayuda a ""correr la voz"" de que ahora es más fácil que nunca influir poitivamente en la vida de nuestra ciudad.

<p> Coming from a family of entrepreneurs, there was no doubt for him on the path to take when the Brewster Club idea came to Julien and him. His experience in finance and accounting acquired throughout his years as a CFO, financial analyst and auditor helps him make sure Brewster Club remains financially viable and has the funds required to get that beer from the brewery to your door.</p>

<p>Ecommerce is nothing new to Julien, neither is entrepreneurship. Indeed, he used to run a web development agency.

<p>If so, we would still be very grateful if you can share our campaign to your friends. A simple share of this campaign to your Facebook wall can go a great way for us!</p>

<h3 style=""font-size: 20px;line-height: 20px;padding:10px 20px;display: inline-block;"">FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Is an Adult Signature Required?</strong></p>
<p>Since you are receiving alcohol, our shipments require an adult signature at delivery, so we usually suggest shipping to a work address or to the home of a relative or friend who is home during the day since the vast majority of shipments will deliver M-F, 8-5 (during working hours).</p>
<p><strong>When will my beer arrive each month?</strong></p>
<p>The purchase will be charged to your credit card within the first week of the month, and the shipment will arrive within 6-10 business days thereafter. For all the Indiegogo backers, you will receive your fist package during the first or second week of January 2017. </p>
<p><strong>Can I select specific beers or beer styles that I want to receive?</strong></p>
<p>Although you cannot choose specific beers or styles that you would like to receive in the monthly package, you will be able to repurchase all of the products that we featured in the previous months as a ''mix &amp; match''.</p>

However, the competition is fierce on the beer market, and microbreweries do need support to get out there. By helping Brewsters all over the country discover your local brewers even from a distance, we help these passionate microbreweries make a dollar they can put towards propelling their craft, creating new recipes and staying in business to keep serving those brews you love.
So, what’s not to like?!
 
OUR TEAM
Alex LaporteCo-founder & CEO

 Coming from a family of entrepreneurs, there was no doubt for him on the path to take when the Brewster Club idea came to Julien and him. His experience in finance and accounting acquired throughout his years as a CFO, financial analyst and auditor helps him make sure Brewster Club remains financially viable and has the funds required to get that beer from the brewery to your door.
Julien PouliotCo-founder & COO

Ecommerce is nothing new to Julien, neither is entrepreneurship. Indeed, he used to run a web development agency. His curiosity and drive were well served, but Julien needed a project that would bring out his passion every day. Trips, discoveries, beers, how can’t he be fully committed to the task?
 
CAN'T BECOME A MEMBER BUT STILL WANT TO HELP?
We know everyone is not yet ready to hop on our all american beer tour. Maybe it is hard for you to get beer delivered to your door (I mean, we can also ship to your office!), or maybe you don't drink beer at all but still respect and support the craft of our brewers.
If so, we would still be very grateful if you can share our campaign to your friends. A simple share of this campaign to your Facebook wall can go a great way for us!
 
FAQ
Is an Adult Signature Required?
Since you are receiving alcohol, our shipments require an adult signature at delivery, so we usually suggest shipping to a work address or to the home of a relative or friend who is home during the day since the vast majority of shipments will deliver M-F, 8-5 (during working hours).
When will my beer arrive each month?
The purchase will be charged to your credit card within the first week of the month, and the shipment will arrive within 6-10 business days thereafter. For all the Indiegogo backers, you will receive your fist package during the first or second week of January 2017. 
Can I select specific beers or beer styles that I want to receive?
Although you cannot choose specific beers or styles that you would like to receive in the monthly package, you will be able to repurchase all of the products that we featured in the previous months as a ''mix & match''.",11.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Pamela decided to take Blueberryjams to Indiegogo for <strong>three reasons</strong> including the ever mysterious element of timing.</p>
<p><strong>1. Blueberryjams is ready to grow! </strong>To do so requires purchasing materials, equipment,  and to spend resources on branding. Crowdfunding allows for this purchasing power as well as a great way to build awareness for and officially launch Blueberryjams.</p>
<p><strong>2. Why 7000$? </strong>In the last year, things have been rocky health wise and friends were kind enough to lend a hand. By turning to IndieGoGo to fundraise and setting the goal at this amount, this allows Pamela to grow the business and use her labour costs to pay back her friends. Setting it at $7000 allows for the growth of Blueberryjams, repaying buds, AND keeping prices affordable.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Growing and launching Blueberryjams is also a way <strong>to equip Pamela</strong> with something solid to turn to in rougher health times and in between work contracts. Instead of simply raising funds to pay back her helping buds, growing Blueberryjams helps Pamela build <strong>the tools to weather stormy times</strong>.</p>
<p>Your contributions and support will help make the following things possible:</p>

<p>Originally from Saguenay Lac St-Jean, where people are referred to colloquially as 'blueberries', <strong>Pamela Fillion,</strong> head squirrel at Blueberryjams, moved to bustling Montreal over a decade ago to pursue her education. Pamela is a disabled queer-femme artist, activist, crafter, keen fermenter, community organizer, and sometimes scholar. She talks quite a bit, finds her own jokes funny, is an avid reader, and enjoys copious amounts of tea. She is roomies with a chatty Siamese cat named Pikachu.</p>
<p>The crux of her work experience revolves around project, program, and organizational development and best practices with an emphasis on skillsharing, education, creativity, and empowerment. At work and beyond, Pamela has a geeky love for archiving and resource building. The kitchen and working with and around food is what Pamela considers her hearth. Blueberryjams is the result of a lively concoction of all of her interests and skills. </p>

<p><strong>Blueberryjams </strong>is a small business or praxis (as Pamela likes to call it). Blueberryjams is a platform where her varied projects find a home and where they interact and intersect. From her arts &amp; culture writing to her crafts and her workshops to radical home economics*, Blueberryjams is a space where Pamela's interests and skills sprout freely and bloom often. </p>

<p>Putting into practice these principles and values while running a small business is why I like to think about Blueberryjams as a praxis or embodying and putting into practice these values throughout operations.</p>
<p>Some of the ways these are put into practice includes making sure that prices are <strong>accessible</strong> and working to dispel some of the greenwashing and attitudes that make these natural health and body products inaccessible.</p>
<p>Another way is through a <strong>collaborative </strong>and not competitive way of operating working together with other makers to co-promote and share best practices. In fact, some perks will include samples from other crafters' work.</p>
<p><strong>Empowerment</strong> is put into action by emphasizing skill sharing, community involvement, and making sure all herbal products have booklets explaining the different elements &amp; properties. This one also starts at home and has been a guiding principle for developing my own skills and the different kinds of projects I undertake and then share with others.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainability</strong> is a running thread amongst the products and choices made with Blueberryjams. Blueberryjams will be branded using a customized stamp using recycled &amp; upcycled cardboard. Paper and glass are favoured over plastic, which is used minimally. Packaging is put together with an effort to diminish waste and in the vein that everything has multiple uses (thus increasing the purchasing power of those buying products). </p>

<p>One of the first projects housed under the moniker Blueberryjams was Pamela's arts &amp; culture journalism and writing. <strong>Over the last 10 years, Pamela has published over 200 articles</strong>, many times a staff writer and content producer, and been involved in several media collectives.</p>
<p>This arts writing is in and of itself a form of community engagement as well as a site where Pamela shares what she learns from conversations with artists about their craft. With a focus on indie bands, social justice, community initiatives, genre film, and local film festivals, Pamela's writing remains a central element of the Blueberryjams project.</p>
<p>At the time of this campaign, with the difficulties faced in the last year forcing energies to be focused on health and trying to making ends meet, Pamela is looking for support/patrons so that she can once again put her energies into writing and, if she dares to dream, refine and elevate this part of her craft to its stage (which she has been planning and dreaming of for a little while now). </p>
<p><strong>Arts &amp; Culture Writing Perk: </strong> You can directly sponsor an article for 40$. In doing so, you will be thanked at the bottom of the article as well as on the updated Blueberryjams website.</p>

<p>Blueberryjams offers a constantly expanding selection of hand made knits. Hats, cowls, scarves, mitts, headbands, blankets!</p>
<p><strong>Knitting Perks: </strong>For the knitting perks, Pamela will have a selection of knits available but can also make customized knits (colours, size, etc) based on Blueberryjams patterns. Don't be shy to get in touch for more information. As well, knits (and other perks available) will be featured throughout the campaign on the Facebook page.</p>
<p><strong>Sewing Perks: </strong>There is one sewn perk available in the Indiegogo perks - The Magic Bag. There will be more available once Blueberryjams gets that sewing machine. &lt;3</p>

<p>One of the fastest growing aspects of Blueberryjams is its Herbalism &amp; Natural Body Products offerings with Pamela diving ever increasingly into this aspect of radical home economics. After several years of learning about, growing, harvesting, and preparing herbs, it seems time to share some of this knowledge with others.</p>
<p>Many of the herbs and plants used in the herbalism perks come from Pamela's personal harvesting and foraging. Other herbs and plants come from sources that Pamela has researched, trusts, and whom have high quality product. As Blueberryjams grows, the emphasis on sourcing herbs &amp; plants locally, carefully, and through community relationships remains a  priority. </p>
<p><strong>Herbal Tea Perks: </strong>There will be over 16 different herbal tea/infusion mixes available to choose from. Descriptions of these mixes will be included in a campaign update and on our Facebook page.</p>

Originally from Saguenay Lac St-Jean, where people are referred to colloquially as 'blueberries', Pamela Fillion, head squirrel at Blueberryjams, moved to bustling Montreal over a decade ago to pursue her education. Pamela is a disabled queer-femme artist, activist, crafter, keen fermenter, community organizer, and sometimes scholar. She talks quite a bit, finds her own jokes funny, is an avid reader, and enjoys copious amounts of tea. She is roomies with a chatty Siamese cat named Pikachu.
The crux of her work experience revolves around project, program, and organizational development and best practices with an emphasis on skillsharing, education, creativity, and empowerment. At work and beyond, Pamela has a geeky love for archiving and resource building. The kitchen and working with and around food is what Pamela considers her hearth. Blueberryjams is the result of a lively concoction of all of her interests and skills.

Blueberryjams is a small business or praxis (as Pamela likes to call it). Blueberryjams is a platform where her varied projects find a home and where they interact and intersect. From her arts & culture writing to her crafts and her workshops to radical home economics*, Blueberryjams is a space where Pamela's interests and skills sprout freely and bloom often.

We had no idea about what would come from the countless hours spent on conceptualizing such a visionary and noble project. </p>
<p>You may be wondering, ""What are we trying to do?"" This is very simple to answer: We are trying to launch a semi-truck into space. After the truck leaves the atmosphere, we intend to have it eject from the rocket, then fall to earth, with our team inside, driving it until we jump out and parachute to safety. The truck will then crash into the ocean. All of this is currently scheduled for early 2018</p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<div>Our team consists of some of the best and brightest individuals on the face of the planets. Our core members include: Davis Thomas, Joseph Erwin, Cole Mazza, Reed Bryant, and Carter Methvin. Not only did these brave souls conceptualize this project, but with exception to Davis Thomas, they will be the fearless astronauts travelling where no one has dared to go before. Additionally, our ground controllers are Austin Warnock and Davis Thomas. Last, but certainly not least, is the man that is making all of this happen: Roady Hollingsworth. If not for the common sense and wisdom of this individual, our project would be nothing more than a bunch of unfocused morons, dreaming about unreasonable space-travel.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>According to our meticulous calculations, we are in need of <b>$14,470,337.34 </b>to complete this project. Now, you may be wondering, ""Why do you think you can do this so inexpensively?"" If we're being honest, we cannot be certain that this will be enough money, but we are pretty sure. To those of you who are skeptical, <a href=""https://www.icloud.com/numbers/0Yzr8yvd9S2bC6e6G0BZoRC8Q#Trailer_Launch_-_Budget"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> is a comprehensive spreadsheet, detailing the expenses.<br/></p>
<p>In return for donating your money to this project you will receive all sorts of gifts and remunerations. We realize that there are so many different projects that you could fund, and we want to make your decision to fund this one worth it. To learn more about all of the neat goodies that you will receive as a result of donating to this project, check out the ""Perks"" section of this campaign.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our fundraising goal, we plan to tackle a slightly smaller project which would be proportionately less awesome, but still basically the awesomest thing to ever happen.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will achieve something never before imagined, inspiring the next generation of dreamers to dream bigger and bolder than ever in the history of mankind.</p>

<h2><strong>Vilka är vi?</strong></h2>
<p>Helena, den Nordiska Valkyrjan, Tetris mästare i organisering lvl 1000 med en passion för holistisk hälsa och nutrition.</p>
<p>Tariq, en Karibisk pirat och kulinär savant, vars perfektion ligger i utsökta och perfekt balanserade smakupplevelser.</p>
<p>Tillsammans startade vi The Soup Company Sweden!</p>
<p>Som titeln beskriver så vill vi samla ihop finans till att få The Soup Company på vägen. Vår avsikt är att få ekologiska och närproducerade alternativ, hälsosamt tillagad “snabbmat” in till städerna, till din dagliga pendling, arbetsplatser, under festivaler och events, serverat året runt från vår FoodTruck, Citroën HY van.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480614710/stsbjepzupi3rxio2je5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>--Fronten</p>

<p>Ditt sponsorskap betyder allt för oss, med din hjälp kan vi sjösätta vår verksamhet och påbörja en resa av entreprenörskap. Med era generösa donationer har vi ett startkapital som grund, där vi kan komplimentera resterande finansiering med ett mindre banklån, eller, i bästa av fallen till och med inte blanda in banken alls!</p>
<p>“Låt maten bli din medicin, och medicin vara din mat” -Hippokrates</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>I detalj</strong></h2>
<p>Vi vill att ni ska vara del av vår genisis. Detta är vad Era sponsringar kommer att gå till:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vår kökslokal behöver rustas upp, lagas och utrustas. Lokalen är gammal och utdaterad, ny el är en nödvändighet, kakel behöver bytas, kylar, frysar, spis och arbetsytor måste in. Att ha lokalen klar ger oss även möjlighet att lite längre fram hjälpa andra nya företagare, i behov av ett livsmedelsgodkänt kök, att starta upp sin verksamhet.</li>
<li>Köpa in stjärnan i företaget, en 60tals Citroën HY van, utrustad med fräsch inredning och ny motor för att klara av alla väder året runt.</li>
<li>Inhandla biologiskt nedbrytbara soppskålar, skedar, servetter och andra serviceartiklar till våra kunder.</li>
<li>Sist men absolut inte minst; gynna våra lokala bönder och producenter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vi vill uppnå 10.000€ i finansiering för att ändra bolagsform och att visa bankerna hur seriösa vi är med vår vision.</p>
<p>Som tack för Er hjälp har vi tagit fram en rad attraktiva gåvopaket som du kan ha glädje av under lång tid. Om du vill så kan du även välja att vara med på lanseringspartyt i januari, då får du även uppleva vad vi kan erbjuda med vår catering verksamhet, utöver de mustiga sopporna vi serverar dagligen, och ha en riktigt rolig kväll med oss i vår färdiga kökslokal!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Den sociala påverkan</strong></h2>
<p>Vilken skillnad gör vi i världen med din hjälp? Och vad bidrar ditt sponsorskap med i det längre loppet?</p>
<p>Otaliga gånger i såväl daglig pendling som på resande fot, har vi fått fia oss i att de mer hälsosamma alternativen helt enkelt inte finns att få tag på. Det erbjuds hamburgare, kaffe, kakor och bakelser, mackor i låga rader och kalla sallader. Med era grymma hjälp kan vi dra vårt strå till stacken och erbjuda pendlare och resenärer god mat som får dig att må bra, i kroppen och i själen!</p>
<ul>
<li>Vi kommer att gynna våra lokala bönder och producenter, vilket i sin tur stärker den totala ekonomin i det lokala område vi verkar.</li>
<li>Vårt syfte är att kunna erbjuda alla vårt goda alternativ till snabbmat; socker och tillsatsfritt, ekologiskt och omfattande allergivänligt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nästa mål är att med samma koncept finnas i flera städer landet igenom, och servera våra värmande och närande soppor med råvaror så lokalt producerat som möjligt.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480614825/rfeg1qj0v0wgxq5uitjy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Risker och utmaningar</strong></h2>
<p>Genom att utmana den vedertagna uppfattningen om vad “snabbmat” är, och ändå lyckats skapa stort intresse i finansiella institutioner, så har vi lyckats övervinna en smärre prövning.</p>
<p>Det konventionella sättet att tillaga både ekologisk och hälsosam proviant involverar tyvärr allt som oftast även kemikalier, tillsatser och utfyllnader för konsistens och att förlänga livslängden på varan. Vi gör tvärt om. Livslängden på vår mat är kort och kommer alltid att vara det, likväl som de hälsosamma egenskaperna inte kommer att riskeras för en viss konsistens. Vi är dock väldigt vana att tänka i andra banor och har blivit påhittiga i att hitta väl fungerande substitut.</p>
<p>Stigmat om att “hälsosam mat” är synonymt med “nötter och sallad” är en annan utmaning vi möter med vårt koncept. Men vi hoppas kunna, med hjälp av våra värmande och mustiga soppor, bredda synen på vad sundhet innebär och visa att det inte bara är sallader som är nyttiga. Med de alternativen vi erbjuder i vår FoodTruck tillgodoser vi Vegansk, Vegetarisk och Allätande kosthållning. Vi är transparenta med våra recept och delar gärna med oss så att ni kan laga samma mat hemma, eller utveckla dem efter egen smak.</p>
<p>Vi erbjuder även våra tjänster mot den öppna samt privata sektorn, till arbetsplatser och evenemang.</p>
<p>Vårt nätverk växer konstant och sträcker sig från nära familj och vänner till bolag och verksamhets kamrater. Med det stora stöd vi har så vet vi att vi kan ta oss an utmaningarna och tackla dem på ett konstruktivt och målmedvetet sätt.</p>
<p>Även om vi inte skulle nå vårt utsatta mål idag, så kommer vi trots det dra visionen i land. Vi tror stenhårt på att vi i Sverige behöver varma, fräscha och hälsosamma alternativ till den dammiga gamla snabbmaten vi får när vi är på språng.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>So what differences are we aiming to make with your help? and what does your help contribute towards?.</p>
<ul>
<li>Countless times we have found ourselves wanting a healthier option whilst we are doing our daily commutes. Only to be faced with the options of burgers, coffee and cake or the cold salad bar in the super markets with its long queues and ""fresh options"".  With your help we want to bring something to the market which gives us that good feeling only healthy nutrious food can give, without the queues or the sugar lapses that traditional fast food provides or as they are commonly known ""food comas"".</li>
<li>We will be bringing food produced by local farmers to your city centres, Helping support the local economies. Which in turn gives back to us, the people who are part of that economy.</li>
<li>Our aim is to gives everyone access to an ecological food option that is allergy , additive and sugar free. Our goal for the future is to provide this by having many kiosks serving from your towns and citys by making a brand that will be synonymous with the points stated above and generating a standard for healthy food options to be provided in your local areas.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have already faced many of our challenges by firstly engageing and opening peoples perceptions to what fast food should be. That combined with presenting these ideals to financial institutes in a way which peaks their interests are many of the hurdles we are trying to overcome.</p>
<p>By showing the benifits of food made from ecological ingredients and cooked in a chemical free way we promote the healthy ""fast food"" option that our main competitors try to create for public consumption, and although they come close with their ""green"" options the mass production levels that they have implemented mean that innevitably the food undergoes some form of additive process to prolong its shelf life. We in turn don't do that, we take whats seasonal, local and fresh and use it as quickly as possible so it can be brought forward for consumption without the neccesity of prolonging the produces life with chemical means.</p>
<p>The stigma is that healthy food means just ""greens and nuts"" or it being solely vegitable, fruit and legume based is another factor we've faced but by providing hearty options and giving people the choices of either vegan, vegitarian or omnivorous we cater to everyone all the while showing that healthy food is more than just salad and greens. Its is a variety that creates the right balance.</p>
<p>Also our transparency in sharing our recipes and ingredient sources gives people the option to try them at home and even better them to their own particular tastes.</p>
<p>Of course there are other risks of, if we don't achieve the desired sales and such business running related risks but by both of us doing business courses and providing our services not just for the public but also towards private sector like events and workplaces. We have and are always building on an extensive network of people from family and friends to alumni of our business associates we believe we are suffiently equiped to face these challenges and approach them with our basis of always keeping to our main aims we will overcome them.</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our entire goal  for funding we will still make this project happen by approaching banks with the most detailled presentation we can make and taking the loans that are necessary to make it happen, such is our devotion to bringing an alternative and healthy food option to people that we are determied to make it work no matter what, so don't be put off if it seems we are not reaching our main goal we will still strive to bring this project forward although it will only take a little more time.</p>

Vilka är vi?
Helena, den Nordiska Valkyrjan, Tetris mästare i organisering lvl 1000 med en passion för holistisk hälsa och nutrition.
Tariq, en Karibisk pirat och kulinär savant, vars perfektion ligger i utsökta och perfekt balanserade smakupplevelser.
Tillsammans startade vi The Soup Company Sweden!
Som titeln beskriver så vill vi samla ihop finans till att få The Soup Company på vägen. Vår avsikt är att få ekologiska och närproducerade alternativ, hälsosamt tillagad “snabbmat” in till städerna, till din dagliga pendling, arbetsplatser, under festivaler och events, serverat året runt från vår FoodTruck, Citroën HY van.
--Fronten
--Bak
Ditt sponsorskap betyder allt för oss, med din hjälp kan vi sjösätta vår verksamhet och påbörja en resa av entreprenörskap. Med era generösa donationer har vi ett startkapital som grund, där vi kan komplimentera resterande finansiering med ett mindre banklån, eller, i bästa av fallen till och med inte blanda in banken alls!
“Låt maten bli din medicin, och medicin vara din mat” -Hippokrates
 
I detalj
Vi vill att ni ska vara del av vår genisis. Detta är vad Era sponsringar kommer att gå till:

Vår kökslokal behöver rustas upp, lagas och utrustas. Lokalen är gammal och utdaterad, ny el är en nödvändighet, kakel behöver bytas, kylar, frysar, spis och arbetsytor måste in. Att ha lokalen klar ger oss även möjlighet att lite längre fram hjälpa andra nya företagare, i behov av ett livsmedelsgodkänt kök, att starta upp sin verksamhet.
Köpa in stjärnan i företaget, en 60tals Citroën HY van, utrustad med fräsch inredning och ny motor för att klara av alla väder året runt.
Inhandla biologiskt nedbrytbara soppskålar, skedar, servetter och andra serviceartiklar till våra kunder.
Sist men absolut inte minst; gynna våra lokala bönder och producenter.

Vi vill uppnå 10.000€ i finansiering för att ändra bolagsform och att visa bankerna hur seriösa vi är med vår vision.
Som tack för Er hjälp har vi tagit fram en rad attraktiva gåvopaket som du kan ha glädje av under lång tid. Om du vill så kan du även välja att vara med på lanseringspartyt i januari, då får du även uppleva vad vi kan erbjuda med vår catering verksamhet, utöver de mustiga sopporna vi serverar dagligen, och ha en riktigt rolig kväll med oss i vår färdiga kökslokal!
 
Den sociala påverkan
Vilken skillnad gör vi i världen med din hjälp? Och vad bidrar ditt sponsorskap med i det längre loppet?
Otaliga gånger i såväl daglig pendling som på resande fot, har vi fått fia oss i att de mer hälsosamma alternativen helt enkelt inte finns att få tag på. Det erbjuds hamburgare, kaffe, kakor och bakelser, mackor i låga rader och kalla sallader. Med era grymma hjälp kan vi dra vårt strå till stacken och erbjuda pendlare och resenärer god mat som får dig att må bra, i kroppen och i själen!

Vi kommer att gynna våra lokala bönder och producenter, vilket i sin tur stärker den totala ekonomin i det lokala område vi verkar.
Vårt syfte är att kunna erbjuda alla vårt goda alternativ till snabbmat; socker och tillsatsfritt, ekologiskt och omfattande allergivänligt.

Nästa mål är att med samma koncept finnas i flera städer landet igenom, och servera våra värmande och närande soppor med råvaror så lokalt producerat som möjligt.

 
Risker och utmaningar
Genom att utmana den vedertagna uppfattningen om vad “snabbmat” är, och ändå lyckats skapa stort intresse i finansiella institutioner, så har vi lyckats övervinna en smärre prövning.
Det konventionella sättet att tillaga både ekologisk och hälsosam proviant involverar tyvärr allt som oftast även kemikalier, tillsatser och utfyllnader för konsistens och att förlänga livslängden på varan. Vi gör tvärt om. Livslängden på vår mat är kort och kommer alltid att vara det, likväl som de hälsosamma egenskaperna inte kommer att riskeras för en viss konsistens. Vi är dock väldigt vana att tänka i andra banor och har blivit påhittiga i att hitta väl fungerande substitut.
Stigmat om att “hälsosam mat” är synonymt med “nötter och sallad” är en annan utmaning vi möter med vårt koncept. Men vi hoppas kunna, med hjälp av våra värmande och mustiga soppor, bredda synen på vad sundhet innebär och visa att det inte bara är sallader som är nyttiga. Med de alternativen vi erbjuder i vår FoodTruck tillgodoser vi Vegansk, Vegetarisk och Allätande kosthållning. Vi är transparenta med våra recept och delar gärna med oss så att ni kan laga samma mat hemma, eller utveckla dem efter egen smak.
Vi erbjuder även våra tjänster mot den öppna samt privata sektorn, till arbetsplatser och evenemang.
Vårt nätverk växer konstant och sträcker sig från nära familj och vänner till bolag och verksamhets kamrater. Med det stora stöd vi har så vet vi att vi kan ta oss an utmaningarna och tackla dem på ett konstruktivt och målmedvetet sätt.
Även om vi inte skulle nå vårt utsatta mål idag, så kommer vi trots det dra visionen i land. Vi tror stenhårt på att vi i Sverige behöver varma, fräscha och hälsosamma alternativ till den dammiga gamla snabbmaten vi får när vi är på språng.
 
Fler sätt du kan hjälpa oss
Oavsett om du har möjlighet att bidraga finansiellt eller ej, så har vi stort behov att sprida ordet vidare. Bara i lilla Linköping bor det 160.000 invånare, om ALLA bidrar med endast 5 svenska kronor, så behöver vi inte längre ta ett banklån!

The Impact
So what differences are we aiming to make with your help? and what does your help contribute towards?.

Countless times we have found ourselves wanting a healthier option whilst we are doing our daily commutes. Only to be faced with the options of burgers, coffee and cake or the cold salad bar in the super markets with its long queues and ""fresh options"".  With your help we want to bring something to the market which gives us that good feeling only healthy nutrious food can give, without the queues or the sugar lapses that traditional fast food provides or as they are commonly known ""food comas"".
We will be bringing food produced by local farmers to your city centres, Helping support the local economies. Which in turn gives back to us, the people who are part of that economy.
Our aim is to gives everyone access to an ecological food option that is allergy , additive and sugar free. Our goal for the future is to provide this by having many kiosks serving from your towns and citys by making a brand that will be synonymous with the points stated above and generating a standard for healthy food options to be provided in your local areas.


Risks & Challenges
We have already faced many of our challenges by firstly engageing and opening peoples perceptions to what fast food should be. That combined with presenting these ideals to financial institutes in a way which peaks their interests are many of the hurdles we are trying to overcome.
By showing the benifits of food made from ecological ingredients and cooked in a chemical free way we promote the healthy ""fast food"" option that our main competitors try to create for public consumption, and although they come close with their ""green"" options the mass production levels that they have implemented mean that innevitably the food undergoes some form of additive process to prolong its shelf life. We in turn don't do that, we take whats seasonal, local and fresh and use it as quickly as possible so it can be brought forward for consumption without the neccesity of prolonging the produces life with chemical means.
The stigma is that healthy food means just ""greens and nuts"" or it being solely vegitable, fruit and legume based is another factor we've faced but by providing hearty options and giving people the choices of either vegan, vegitarian or omnivorous we cater to everyone all the while showing that healthy food is more than just salad and greens. Its is a variety that creates the right balance.
Also our transparency in sharing our recipes and ingredient sources gives people the option to try them at home and even better them to their own particular tastes.
Of course there are other risks of, if we don't achieve the desired sales and such business running related risks but by both of us doing business courses and providing our services not just for the public but also towards private sector like events and workplaces. We have and are always building on an extensive network of people from family and friends to alumni of our business associates we believe we are suffiently equiped to face these challenges and approach them with our basis of always keeping to our main aims we will overcome them.
Even if we don't reach our entire goal  for funding we will still make this project happen by approaching banks with the most detailled presentation we can make and taking the loans that are necessary to make it happen, such is our devotion to bringing an alternative and healthy food option to people that we are determied to make it work no matter what, so don't be put off if it seems we are not reaching our main goal we will still strive to bring this project forward although it will only take a little more time.

<li>Youth would have access to technology, resources, mentorship, opportunities.   Spending time  in the Firehouse, the Prophouse, the Studio, the  Theatre, the ICE Box, The Rooftop   - spaces to go, to be, to learn to earn - creating networks, creating sustainable events.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>Thank you for any contribution which goes to the big picture - but also important is the perks include  art and craft element assisting crafters to earn as suppliers and mentors in the Village.   Every element creates jobs somewhere in the event value chain.   The perks can be customised so just drop us a note if you're looking for anything special or bulk. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're looking to transfer over 35 years of  eventing know-how into a collective vehicle for sustainable social, environmental and economic development solutions .  To inspire event professionals to turn their eventing expertise into catalytic value to strategically grow the economic benefits of the industry and grow extended industries exponentially.  </p>
<p>We believe that it's time for baby boomers, exiting the industry in the near future,  to cut the umbilical cord - to be there when needed - not to be there to tell youth how to do it but to be there if they need coaching, mentorship. resources.   Youth can create jobs through events if we support them.  </p>
<p>We are privileged to be part of and serve on the IFEA - International Festivals &amp; Events Association World Board - and just being part of the global picture and the support from IFEA on our journey to get us stable has been huge.  </p>
<p>We were privileged to have Jean Mc Faddin from New York - an IFEA Hall of Fame legend - share her insight into parades, like the Macy's Parade - she was an absolute inspiration for the young entrepreneurs who are now rearing to go on  our planned Career Carnival Sustainable Development Goal parade   </p>

Sustainable Events for Sustainable Livelihoods.</span></p>
<p>Through the Gauteng TSHEPO 500 000 programme  we've been honoured  to work with an amazing group of  Youth, including the  Raphushana Kagiso Peace Festival team in the Western Corridor of Gauteng - who together have delivered some awesome events and looking forward to the future to replicate the Peace Festivals throughout the Province.</p>
<p>These ICE Youth are a great example of caring, sharing young generation leadership and we are excited to support the youth to make the difference we all want to see.  The real issue is that there are 100,000's of youth in local communities who are unemployed and need workplace experience - so this is our opportunity to <strong>#LetYouthCreateJobs. </strong>  Events create jobs and can contribute greatly towards increased  tourism through events. </p>
<p>The Gauteng Economic Development Tourism Department supported the three day event coordinator challenge as seen on the video and that event was proof of the role that events can play in creating  socially inclusive places and the magic that can happen when youth have access to resources. </p>
<p>Thanks to Chemetrix and Mary's Community Centre  the Socio-Economic Development Programme was a great success for the local community children who were beneficiaries - from guest readers in  Jax's Local Story Exchange, to research in the  Bitco Internet Development Centre, the performances they planned and produced for Mandela Day for their parents, and youth learning to play and teach the Marimba's in the West Rand and at the Skills Village in Joburg. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>So what is the greatest risk...  whatever we raise will produce great results - if we raise less  - then numbers and events will be smaller -  but whatever is invested, we can make work - it will take the programme to the next level.  If we raise more, more events and more local communities participating.    Scalable down or up.   But basically that is it.   The model is in place that no matter what small investment we get, we can make something happen - the buildings are there - the exiting baby boomers are there to assist in skills transfer and mentorship..    If we get great funding it would be catalytic and would make a great handover to the next generation and could go to scale. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whatever way you can help to support the vision would be great.</p>
<p>You could share the campaign - you could share your talents and do skills transfer - physically or virtually.   You could support our enterprise development by investing in customizing any of the perks that you know will create a job for some of the amazing artists and crafters that we have been privileged to work with.  We've put pictures of some of the pieces on the Gallery including some special original art - your investment can impact many lives in the event value chain. </p>
<p>You could share our campaign with the Indiegogo share tools!</p>Thank you for reading this! #LetYouthCreateJobs</div><p> </p></div>","Skills Village is based in Frere Road, in Bez Valley Johannesburg in a network of old and very old buildings and we’re set and ready to let the Youth Create, and we want them to Create  Enterprises that create Jobs – for themselves.

4. Produce a Pilot Social Media Production - unscripted self-contained documentary inspired by The Experience Economy  Work is Theatre & Every Business a Stage (Pine&Gilmore)   : $28,000

It would be great to have 'visiting' industry professionals and youth from other countries supporting the interventions - so let us know if you are coming to South Africa. 
At the Global Entrepreneurs Week in Johannesburg in November 2016 they talked about ""flipping the classroom"" - we need mentors, and experts to be there, working with youth - not lecturing but doing.  Global Entrepreneurs Week to be celebrated at the Village during the 13 - 17 November 2017
Youth would have access to technology, resources, mentorship, opportunities.   Spending time  in the Firehouse, the Prophouse, the Studio, the  Theatre, the ICE Box, The Rooftop   - spaces to go, to be, to learn to earn - creating networks, creating sustainable events.  


What you get
Thank you for any contribution which goes to the big picture - but also important is the perks include  art and craft element assisting crafters to earn as suppliers and mentors in the Village.   Every element creates jobs somewhere in the event value chain.   The perks can be customised so just drop us a note if you're looking for anything special or bulk. 
 
The Impact
We're looking to transfer over 35 years of  eventing know-how into a collective vehicle for sustainable social, environmental and economic development solutions .  To inspire event professionals to turn their eventing expertise into catalytic value to strategically grow the economic benefits of the industry and grow extended industries exponentially.  
We believe that it's time for baby boomers, exiting the industry in the near future,  to cut the umbilical cord - to be there when needed - not to be there to tell youth how to do it but to be there if they need coaching, mentorship. resources.   Youth can create jobs through events if we support them.  
We are privileged to be part of and serve on the IFEA - International Festivals & Events Association World Board - and just being part of the global picture and the support from IFEA on our journey to get us stable has been huge.  
We were privileged to have Jean Mc Faddin from New York - an IFEA Hall of Fame legend - share her insight into parades, like the Macy's Parade - she was an absolute inspiration for the young entrepreneurs who are now rearing to go on  our planned Career Carnival Sustainable Development Goal parade   
The quest for a Professional Certification for Event Management  has been supported by many event professionals - from the amazing EMBOK - Event Management Body of Knowledge team Julia Rutherford Silvers (www.juliasilvers.com)  Philip Mondor, Joe Goldblatt, William O'Toole (www.epms.net) Glenn Bowdin, Matthew Gonsalez, the late Dr. Kathy Nelson, and Janet Landey.   To the awesome Human Resources Canadian Tourism visionaries - Philip Mondor and the team that pioneered the Event Standards and the International Event Qualification Framework (www.emerit.ca)  So, we all have access to  a progression of standard for the professional delivery of safe, secure, social,economic and environmentally responsible events. Sustainable Events for Sustainable Livelihoods.
Through the Gauteng TSHEPO 500 000 programme  we've been honoured  to work with an amazing group of  Youth, including the  Raphushana Kagiso Peace Festival team in the Western Corridor of Gauteng - who together have delivered some awesome events and looking forward to the future to replicate the Peace Festivals throughout the Province.
These ICE Youth are a great example of caring, sharing young generation leadership and we are excited to support the youth to make the difference we all want to see.  The real issue is that there are 100,000's of youth in local communities who are unemployed and need workplace experience - so this is our opportunity to #LetYouthCreateJobs.   Events create jobs and can contribute greatly towards increased  tourism through events. 
The Gauteng Economic Development Tourism Department supported the three day event coordinator challenge as seen on the video and that event was proof of the role that events can play in creating  socially inclusive places and the magic that can happen when youth have access to resources. 
Thanks to Chemetrix and Mary's Community Centre  the Socio-Economic Development Programme was a great success for the local community children who were beneficiaries - from guest readers in  Jax's Local Story Exchange, to research in the  Bitco Internet Development Centre, the performances they planned and produced for Mandela Day for their parents, and youth learning to play and teach the Marimba's in the West Rand and at the Skills Village in Joburg. 

Risks & Challenges
So what is the greatest risk...  whatever we raise will produce great results - if we raise less  - then numbers and events will be smaller -  but whatever is invested, we can make work - it will take the programme to the next level.  If we raise more, more events and more local communities participating.    Scalable down or up.   But basically that is it.   The model is in place that no matter what small investment we get, we can make something happen - the buildings are there - the exiting baby boomers are there to assist in skills transfer and mentorship..    If we get great funding it would be catalytic and would make a great handover to the next generation and could go to scale. 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Whatever way you can help to support the vision would be great.
You could share the campaign - you could share your talents and do skills transfer - physically or virtually.   You could support our enterprise development by investing in customizing any of the perks that you know will create a job for some of the amazing artists and crafters that we have been privileged to work with.  We've put pictures of some of the pieces on the Gallery including some special original art - your investment can impact many lives in the event value chain.

His 3 daughters attend Boiling Springs schools and his entrepreneurial wife April runs their multiple businesses from their office center in the west side of the community.  </p>
<p>Josh’s passion for brewing started like many other home brewers, with the gift of a homebrew kit from his wife.  This hobby brought Josh to the Spartanburg Brew Club where he and Jonathan met and became friends.</p>
<p>Through this friendship the duo have decided to share their passion for craft beer with you, and with this we bring you New Groove Artisan Brewery.</p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Our goal is to provide the Boiling Springs area of Spartanburg with a community gathering place. A spot that you can be proud of and know that you can meet your friends and hang out.  A place that produces exceptional local, fresh beer that will please both recent craft beer converts and experienced beer enthusiasts alike. A bright yet cozy place where everyone feels comfortable and relaxed.</p>
<p>Boiling Springs is a rapidly growing and thriving area that is thirsty for a high quality and flavorful craft beer bar and brewery. Jonathan and Josh are currently constructing the brewery in the 4100 sq ft space at 4078 Hwy 9.  The brewery portion of the planning is taking shape and brewing vessels are paid for and scheduled for delivery.  </p>

<p>Where we need your help is with the taproom space.  We are planning to construct a comfortable and trendy social area that you, your family, and your friends can use to enjoy our hand crafted beers, craft sodas, and guest tap ciders and wine.</p>
<p>This will include tables and chairs for the main area and bar stools for the 22’ bar.  There will be televisions, a comfy lounge for maximum relaxation, a stage for musicians to perform, games to entertain the whole family, and excellent spaces for gatherings of friends or meetings.</p>

<p>We are building a carefully selected size system, designed to allow frequent brewing. This is our plan to ensure a wide variety, but also the highest level in freshness. Our goal is that every time you come in there is something new to try. After all, if the same beer is on every time, how fresh could it be?</p>
<p>We will be serving our beer draft only for the first phase of our plan, but we will offer to go beer sales with a fantastic vessel called the ""Crowler."" A Crowler (Can+Growler) is a 32oz can that is filled and sealed right at the bar. The aluminum Crowler offers benefits over traditional glass growlers, in that the beer is better protected against light and oxygen, two of the main spoilers of fresh beer. It is also recyclable, and doesn't pose the shatter danger of glass - making it ideal for taking up to the street and sharing beer at the lake or pool. When you're done simply toss it in with your other metal for recycling, and purchase a new one on your next visit. No cleaning required, which leads to fresher, better tasting beer! We will still be happy to fill your glass growlers as well, of course. </p>

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>The team behind Bootleg Brew Co. consists of Matt Tilley and Morgan Turner. We met while working together at Newfound Sushi. We've both been working in the restaurant industry across Canada for years and have seen that more and more that people like to know where their food and drink come from. Using the skills we've gained from years behind the line, we've developed beers to compliment food, and seasonal beers to show off the best that Newfoundland has to offer. We're planning to open a 3 bbl microbrewery in Corner Brook, Newfoundland, so that we can produce enough to share our beer all across the island.</p>
<h3>Why we're here</h3>
</div><div><p>We've been working hard over the last few months to source the best equipment and ingredients possible, as well as an existing building that fits our specific needs. We are just looking for that last push to make sure that we are good to get going. Any funds that we receive will go towards our Brewha 3 bbl system and any renovations that we need to meet all of the regulations necessary to produce beer in Newfoundland.</p></div><div>
<h3>Our aim</h3>
<p>While Newfoundland beer is very nostalgic for us, we both grew up drinking Blackhorse (after we turned 19 of course), we've noticed the huge growth of craft beer in the other provinces we've lived in over the last few years. While it's great drinking a beer that's been carefully crafted with love and attention, the community surrounding it is just as important. Working with local chefs, artists and other brewers, we plan to help create a community across Newfoundland to show off the talented people that call this province home.</p>

<h3>Why Support Evelyn's?</h3>
<p>About two years ago, I had some girlfriend's out to Buffalo to shop downtown for a day and then hang out at my house.  Little did I know, this little excursion would set in motion the concept for Evelyn's Wine Bar.  It was a simple question posed by a girlfriend around lunch time -- ""ok, now where can we get some wine and something to eat?""  My answer was that we didn't really have a place like that downtown, we could just go to my house after we were done.  I had wine there.  Her followup comment... ""you should open a wine bar down here.""</p>

About two years ago, I had some girlfriend's out to Buffalo to shop downtown for a day and then hang out at my house.  Little did I know, this little excursion would set in motion the concept for Evelyn's Wine Bar.  It was a simple question posed by a girlfriend around lunch time -- ""ok, now where can we get some wine and something to eat?""  My answer was that we didn't really have a place like that downtown, we could just go to my house after we were done.  I had wine there.  Her followup comment... ""you should open a wine bar down here.""
I knew it was something I'd love to do and I knew Buffalo needed it.  Such a beautiful historic downtown should have a nice bistro/wine bar.  There are always shoppers around.  It is the perfect location --  old brick buildings and sidewalks, a gorgeous lake setting, a movie theatre, cute little boutiques.  Seemed strange it didn't have a wine bar.  It is the perfect place for one.
About a year later, I met the Chamber of Commerce president and asked her why Buffalo didn't have a wine bar?  Is the city tough on ordinances? Is it hard to get a license?  To my surprise her answer was ""no, just no one has done it."" In fact she was sure the city would support something like that and knew the retailers would. And they have.
So, now I'm at the construction stage.  The plans have been approved, the licenses applied for, the building about to start.  I've secured an SBA loan, have applied for leases for the kitchen equipment, and put some personal savings to good use to get us to this point.  But there is just a bit more funding needed and I would be so grateful for your support.

</p><p><b>The People’s Bank of Govanhill</b></p>
<p>is a local currency project in Govanhill, Glasgow
initiated by artist Ailie Rutherford </p>
<p>The aim is to
create a new form of currency in Govanhill, through a series of currency
experiments, workshops and discussion events talking about money; looking at
what’s wrong with our current economic situation and what we can do to change
it. </p>
<p>The People’s
Bank of Govanhill is an action research project, testing out different forms of
local currency in order to find out what works best for the community and
engaging local people in discussion.</p>
<p>The exchange
booth allows you to exchange Govanhill notes for sterling on a
pay-what-you-can-afford basis. Each time the booth operates the notes can be
used as vouchers exchangeable for local goods and services.</p>
<p>The suggested
exchange rate is </p>
<p>1 Govanhill
note : 100<sup>th</sup> of your weekly income. </p>
<p>The first set
of Govanhill notes was designed by <a href=""http://www.ailierutherford.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ailie Rutherford</a> during her residency at the
Govanhill Baths in 2015 </p>
<p>There are now
around 200 of these notes in circulation.</p>
<p><b>What
The People’s Bank of Govanhill needs now</b></p>
<p>We really
need your help to keep this project going, to print some new notes for The
People’s Bank of Govanhill and to allow us to carry on this programme of events
and ultimately to develop a local currency in Govanhill. The project has no
core funding so is entirely reliant on donations and small grants to keep going.</p>
<p>A second set
of notes is being designed by Govanhill based artist <a href=""http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/video/marvin-gaye-chetwynd-studio-visit-tateshots"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marvin Gaye Chetwynd </a>but
we need your support to print them.</p>
<p>If we reach
our target we will also then have enough money to commission one more local
artist to design the third set of notes.</p>
<p>The new notes
will be launched at Govanhill Baths in April, with a series of currency
exchange events to follow.</p>
<p><b>And
What You Get</b></p>
<p>All the notes
are hand screen printed and then signed, dated and editioned.</p>
<p>Everyone who
donates will receive a printed Govanhill note. We ask that you consider our
pay-what-you-can-afford exchange rate and donate what you can afford to help us
realise this next stage of the project.</p>
<p>Once we reach our target, donations of
over £25 will receive a complete set of three limited edition banknotes; signed
and editioned by all three artists.</p>
<p>In order to receive your
printed notes, please give your details when donating. You can then either
collect your notes from the exchange booth at the launch of the new currency in
April, or if you live outside Glasgow please send a stamped self-addressed envelope
to: </p>
<p>The People's Bank of
Govanhill c/o Ailie Rutherford, Studio 4 Glasgow Independent Studios, Trongate
103, Glasgow G1 5HD <br/></p>
<p>You can

</div>","VERSION EN FRANCAIS ICIHello, we are Florence and Thibault !As kids we used to eat super delicious Ballekes (Belgian meatballs) at our grandparent's house and as we grew up we kept good memories of this taste. In 2012, we wanted to follow our passion for food and share our grandmother's traditional recipes. We started a bistro ('t Bolleke) in Brussels serving traditional Belgian cuisine with Ballekes as a speciality. Our customers loved it !Video of 't Bolleke shooted by TV-Brussel in 2014.

Thibault's Grandmother


BALLEKES, A NEW PROJECT 
We all live fast urban lives with less time or no will to cook sp we stop at fast-food restaurants with average quality products. Obviously, there is a real need for better quality food options at democratic prices and cool atmosphere. BALLEKES is an answer to this need.OUR VISION


Create a place where you can enjoy good food at affordable prices


Making sure you enjoy a great Belgian Experience 


Serve you the best Belgian meatballs, fries and Beers







THE CONCEPT 

BALLEKES is a fast-casual restaurant with minimum service like a fast-food but with high quality food. You order at the counter and have the possibility to customize your choice. The interior design is also very important : good materials and cosy atmosphere.



Inspiration (ONLY) for the counter and the cosy atmoshere


MENU 

The menu selection above the counter is very simple: 



 Select your taste: Pork/Beef, Chicken or Bio Veggie 


 Select your style : Belgian sauces, Baguette or Salad 


 Select your sides and extras









We are committed to use local and organic food as much as we can and of course we guarantee 100% taste explosion.








LOCATION 
Chaussée de Charleroi, 174 - 1060 Brussels (OPEN 7/7)

Located at the intersection of many trendy neighbourhoods : Chatelain, Avenue Louise, St-Gilles and Uccle; it's the perfect location to meet up with your friends for a quick bite !

WE NEED YOUR HELP ! 
The place was abandoned for more than 3 years and we had to rebuild everything from scratch.




We have done all the main structural renovations (water, gaz, electricity, walls, ceiling, air conditioning, toilets) and we bought all the professional equipments for the kitchen. But we still need an additional 25.000€ for :



The carpentry : custom-made counters, benches, tables and furniture (similar to inspiration above) so that you can easily order, sit back, relax and enjoy your Ballekes with a fresh Belgian beer.

The lights: so that you can see the meatballs you eat and Instagram your food to your friends.

The floor: renovate the wooden floor which is broken in many places so that you can enjoy the place for many years to come. 




SUSTAINABILITY AND SOCIAL JUSTICE
If we can raise the money, we will work with Klimop for the Carpentry. It's a workshop inside the ""Atelier Groot Eiland"",a non-profit organisation that has the mission to reintegrate long-term unemployed people from disadvantaged neighborhoods of Brussels. In addition to that, they use recycled wood.

""By supporting our crowdfunding you help saving the planet and support poverty reduction at the same time. So cool isn't it?""

PERKS 

Support BALLEKES and get plenty of rewards  that match the value of your contribution. 

Our perks include: 



Your name in our thank you video in front of Manneken Piss


Goodies:  t-shirts, caps, glasses, bottle opener 


Your name on the wall of Baller fame inside our shop to be thanked forever 


Limted Edition Crowdfunder Card that gives you 10% off FOR LIFE


Your name engraved in a table so that it will be yours forever 

Party for all your friends, family and colleagues 

Meatballs for life



Pay attention that shipping cost are applicable if you want us to ship your perks instead of getting it in the shop.



Even if you cannot contribute financially to the project now, you can still support us by making a lot of noise and sharing it with your friends :)


Thank you for joining the Belgian Meatball Revolution.

You are awesome !

<h3>Concept Summary<br/>
</h3><p>The Boomerang Shield concepts has
been crafted for the purpose of saving lives in today’s world, by
revolutionizing traditional law enforcement capabilities to a new,
sophisticated and secure level and completely eliminate any fear or doubts
traditional law enforcers are faced with.</p>
<p>In today’s day and age, a growing
number of countries, nations, ideologies and gangs are involved in war, terror
and civilized disruption. Traditionally , the solution has been served by
adding manpower, force, weapons and resources which rarely achieve a real solution
other than disrupting daily activity for millions of innocent people. </p>
<p>The results are poor; innocent
people die every day, and in cases where law enforcement are lucky to timely
intervene and the subject attacker is confronted and killed, the result is
endless public disarrays over police brutality.</p>
<p>The Boomerang Shield is designed to confront
and eliminate today's dangers and has the capabilities to immediately
neutralize imminent threats with no loss of life. This will tremendously help
law enforcement, local governments, border control and security personnel to
maintain ultimate control of their constituent’s security at the highest level
at all known trouble spots, at all times.</p>
<h3><b>How
does it work??</b></h3>
<p><br/>
The patent pending highly intelligent software will work
seamlessly in conjunction with the cutting edge futuristic hardware with
advanced military precision to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Automatically detect and deter
     violence in everyday life. i.e. in Bus Stations, Train Platforms or even on
     street corners.</li>
<li>Immediately detect an exposed
     weapon of any sort.</li>
<li>Trigger an alarm when detecting
     a concealed weapon, using advanced technology.</li>
<li>Immediately evaluate the danger
     level prior to striking, and in the events of ambiguous happenings trigger
     a live feed to a looped monitoring authority, for direction.</li>
<li>Assist the operator at the
     off-site monitoring authority, to approve the system to eliminate the
     danger by firing a highly accurate Taser cartridge directly on the attacker,
     with a single click.</li>
<li>Capture and submit recordings
     of the event, which shall be automatically generated at the sign of any
     threat, to law enforcement to assist in prosecution.</li>
</ul>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Map high sensitive areas and tweak the system to
automatically discharge and eliminate attackers at first sign of danger.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Work in conjunction with The National Threat Monitor, where
an upgraded threat level will automatically operate the system on a higher
sensitivity basis. </p>
<p>In the automatic triggering mode, the
system will be tuned to differentiate between civilians and law enforcement personnel
and would not act as a disturbance to every day law enforcement activity. It
will only utilize positive assistance. Law enforcement personnel will have the
option to remotely disarm the units in a variety of easy to use methods, each
of which can be programmed to best suit the local requirements.</p>
<h3><b>The
Difference between Life and Death</b></h3>
<p>In its current form, law enforcement first need to be notified when
a threat surfaces; then, be present or waste time rushing to the scene in order
to determine if and how to respond or act; multiply that by hundreds of daily
threats, and that task becomes logistically impossible.</p>
<p>With The Boomerang Shield, law
enforcement suddenly have a helping upper hand, their presence extends to
instantly reach where the shield is, they see what the shield sees on the
second and can either manually operate the shield to neutralize threats, or,
direct the shield to automatically do so. </p>
<p>In the event of a terrorist attack, or even worse, a simultaneous terror attack
where law enforcement does not know where and what to first respond to, and can
definitely not handle all at once; The Boomerang Shield will already be there,
ready prepped and on target to act on a milliseconds notice to neutralize the
threat and save lives!</p>
<h3><b>Where
will The Boomerang Shield be installed?</b></h3>
<p>The Boomerang Shield will come in
many variations to service:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private Residences</li>
<li>Gated communities</li>
<li>Banks and Department Stores</li>
<li>Mobile Security Personnel</li>
<li>Government Agencies</li>
<li>Borders and Checkpoints</li>
<li>Transit</li>
<li>Neutralization of would be
     suicide jumpers</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>What
We Need, to Deliver!</b></h3>
<p>To turn this amazing concept into a
fully functioning working and serving being we would need all the help we can
get from you in order to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Successfully complete the research
     and development of the vital components, processors and software that will
     integrate, run and power the system.</li>
<li>Establish a team of world
     leading programmers with a focus on military defense.</li>
<li>Set-Up the necessary facilities
     and environments to fully test all versions of prototypes in secure
     locations.</li>
<li>Source manufacturers for the
     most viable, durable, materials, components, and protection.</li>
</ul>
<h3><b>The
Impact</b></h3>
<p>Saving lives on a daily basis is a
big deal, but, saving lives on a daily basis while enhancing the lives of
millions is an even bigger deal. Once
The Boomerang Shield will launch successfully, saving numerous lives on a daily
basis will be ""No Major Deal!"" people in today's world would able to
enjoy the freedom and security once again whilst Law Enforcement agencies will
be able to operate up to the highest standards, and be protected, knowing where
and when they need to go to, and that they will always have a friendly

<h3><b>Challenges
&amp; Risks</b></h3>

Life vests that save lives, empower women and reduce waste </b><br/></p><p>Vestability
is a non-profit organisation, created by a team of university students who have
a common goal to reduce the death rate amongst fisherman, empower women and
reduce waste in Sainte Luce, Madagascar. </p>
<p>Sainte Luce is a rural fishing village, with 450
fishermen and their families. Fishing is the main form of employment and the
largest source of income. However fishing is extremely risky: boats are made to a poor standard, produced from
local hollowed tree trunk, and there is no access to safety equipment. The
boats are prone to capsize due to the rough conditions of the Indian Ocean, and
fishermen lack any ability to swim. A<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">s a result, fishermen face a daily risk of
death from drowning.</span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449589056/x9kld6i0pdvvwjyfvhy2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Throughout
Madagascar, households typically rely solely on male income. Cultural
expectations, domestic responsibilities and lack of employment opportunities
restrict women from earning. In Sainte Luce, the majority of families are
living in extreme poverty. Women are traditionally forced to rely on their
husbands’ or fathers’ minimal income. Due to the dangers of fishing, women are
often left widowed.  As such, both single
and widowed women are left particularly vulnerable to poverty. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449590150/iftqypvxp7p69gfqo9fa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>In line with
the 2015 UN Global Goals, Vestability aims to work towards alleviating extreme
poverty, fighting inequality and reducing climate change. Vestability aims to reduce the risk of fishing, whilst offering a source of income for vulnerable women in Sainte Luce. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">To do this, we
will establish a co-operative of 3 local women. The members will work together to
produce life vests made from local waste materials: plastic bottles and rice
sacks. The members will then be able to sell the life vests to local fishermen,
catering for the severe demand for adequate safety equipment.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b>What we need</b></p>
<p>We
are hoping to raise £10,000 to kick-start our project. We will use this money
to: </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Produce and
test life vest prototypes </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Provide
training for our co-operative members</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Provide
information sessions to fishermen on the importance of life vests </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Send a member
of our team to Madagascar to establish and monitor our project</p>
<p><b>Your impact </b></p>
<p>By helping
Vestability, you will be helping transform the lives of families in the Sainte
Luce community. By introducing life vests, we can not only substantially decrease
the risks of drowning for fishermen, but also introduce a reliable source of
income for women. In addition, our co-operative members will learn valuable
skills in product creation, business and sales, and use of recycled materials.
Moreover, the use of recycled materials will prevent environmental degradation
and the dumping of plastics in to the sea. In the long term, we hope to boost
the economy of Sainte Luce, alleviating poverty and improving lives.  </p>

fishermen and their families. Fishing is the main form of employment and the
largest source of income. However fishing is extremely risky: boats are made to a poor standard, produced from
local hollowed tree trunk, and there is no access to safety equipment. The
boats are prone to capsize due to the rough conditions of the Indian Ocean, and
fishermen lack any ability to swim. As a result, fishermen face a daily risk of
death from drowning.
Throughout
Madagascar, households typically rely solely on male income. Cultural
expectations, domestic responsibilities and lack of employment opportunities
restrict women from earning. In Sainte Luce, the majority of families are
living in extreme poverty. Women are traditionally forced to rely on their
husbands’ or fathers’ minimal income. Due to the dangers of fishing, women are
often left widowed.  As such, both single
and widowed women are left particularly vulnerable to poverty. 
In line with
the 2015 UN Global Goals, Vestability aims to work towards alleviating extreme
poverty, fighting inequality and reducing climate change. Vestability aims to reduce the risk of fishing, whilst offering a source of income for vulnerable women in Sainte Luce. To do this, we
will establish a co-operative of 3 local women. The members will work together to
produce life vests made from local waste materials: plastic bottles and rice
sacks. The members will then be able to sell the life vests to local fishermen,
catering for the severe demand for adequate safety equipment.

What we need
We
are hoping to raise £10,000 to kick-start our project. We will use this money
to: 
· 
Produce and
test life vest prototypes 
· 
Provide
training for our co-operative members
· 
Provide
information sessions to fishermen on the importance of life vests 
· 
Send a member
of our team to Madagascar to establish and monitor our project
Your impact 
By helping
Vestability, you will be helping transform the lives of families in the Sainte
Luce community. By introducing life vests, we can not only substantially decrease
the risks of drowning for fishermen, but also introduce a reliable source of
income for women. In addition, our co-operative members will learn valuable
skills in product creation, business and sales, and use of recycled materials.
Moreover, the use of recycled materials will prevent environmental degradation
and the dumping of plastics in to the sea. In the long term, we hope to boost
the economy of Sainte Luce, alleviating poverty and improving lives.

<p>Montana Fresh Shrimp Company is working to grow and sell fresh marine shrimp to a local market. Our intent is to offer, in a sustainable way of growing, one of the highest-protein sea foods that is local, fresh, GMO-free and heavy-metal free, using organic growing methods. We are changing the food supply one ingredient at a time. We believe in the local farmers market slogan ""Know your local farmer""  </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We have a crew of over 12 people working tirelessly on construction, marketing, accounting, social media and website as well as an aquaculture science consultant team and a microbiologist. </span><br/></p>
<p>We have been working diligently on our facility.  Building walls, painting, sealing the floors with a slip-proof water resistant epoxy have turned our facility into a healthy place for the shrimp to grow in a good environment and create a safe place for our shrimp wranglers to work.  <br/></p>
<p>The first two sets of beta tanks are built and lined with a special marine liner.  The beta tanks hold about 8300 gallons of water, per four tank set.  Phase two will include installing fiberglass tanks more than twice that size at about 18000 gallons.</p>
<p>How are we different from other shrimp farming operations? We are working to grow shrimp that have a higher nutrition content than the average shrimp. This is due to our unique method of feeding which includes two types of algae one being spirulina. The algaes make the shrimp higher in omega 3's and keep the water clean. Our method of feeding them also increases their protein content as well as adds astaxanthin. Astaxanthin is a powerful antioxidant that aids in fighting cancer, macular degeneration, fighting dementia, enhanced athletic performance, and fights the aging process.  </p>
<p>We will also have the ability to remove the iodine normally found in shrimp, which will be beneficial for those with some seafood sensitivities and allergies.</p>
<p>We will be donating part of our shrimp harvest to local food banks, and other organizations who help low income and homeless citizens.  We will also be donating a portion of our sales to local organizations to help them in their efforts to help people who need it.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We are already well underway but, we need help with some key items to get the first babies in the tanks. </p>
<ul>
<li>oxygenation bubblers </li>
<li>high quality feed for the shrimp</li>
<li>heaters to keep the shrimp warm during our long Montana winters</li>
<li>plumbing</li>
</ul>
<div>Your contribution will help create a much needed clean food source for the country.  90% of the shrimp we eat come from foreign countries, some having been treated with antibiotics and fed with questionable feed sources. We are working hard to change that and reclaim a healthy, high protein food source for generations to come. We have a dedicated team working tirelessly to get us up and running with our first set of tanks growing shrimp.  We are starting from scratch and need the help of the crowd to succeed in providing a clean food source. </div>
<div>We have some amazing perks for this first phase of our farm. Our team thought hard about what would be the best things to offer our generous contributors. Our first harvest is not until May 2016 so we had to get creative. We hope you love them as much as we do. On top of these perks we are investing in a camera for a live feed of the shrimp farming process that everyone will be able to access 24/7!</div>

The choices (perks) are explained  on the sidebar and hopefully this will make it worthwhile for you.  You can see, some of the thousands of pictures available on the Muskogee Directory Facebook page.   Sizes ranging from 4x6 to 8x10 mailed to your home.  And in many cases poster size prints are available for pictures taken in the last 2 years.Or, you can come to my office and we can have fun creating new pictures for you, using greenscreen technology, to digitally replace the backgrounds. What about businesses?Prints are available for you as well.  There are pictures from hundreds of events, such as grand opening, event sponsors, parades, etc.   Higher donations will eligible for in store pictures, promotional videos, or maybe you want a basic mobile app for your business. If you don't need it, maybe you want to sponsor a local non-profit or maybe a family photo shoot for those that may be less fortunate. And if I want to help further?if you want to help us even more, please consider any of the following:
spread the word - share this campaign with your friends on your social networks or on email, and ask them to give us a hand

you can also, contribute offline as well, money order, cash, checks

<p>Here are 5 health benefits of practicing yoga in an environment that’s heated with Infrared <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Increased Flexibility</strong> – Because Infrared heat is directly warming the muscles, it opens them up allowing for a greater range of flexibility. A study at <a href=""http://www.sunlighten.com/pdfs/auburn-study-111313.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Auburn University</a> compared how far athletes were able to stretch in a training room to how far they were able to stretch in an infrared sauna. Researchers concluded participants were able to stretch as much as three times their normal amount in the infrared environment. This will allow yoga students to open up, melt deep into the poses and gain confidence in their practice.</li>
<li>
<strong>Increased Circulation</strong> – Infrared heat has been shown to stimulate blood flow by opening up the body’s capillaries. This has an incredible affect on the body and offers a variety of benefits. It can help lower blood pressure, oxygenate the organs and rid the body of toxins (read more below).</li>
<li>
<strong>Detoxification</strong> – Simply put, infrared heat will make you sweat, which is a good thing because it is your body’s natural way of flushing toxins. As your body absorbs infrared heat, water molecules begin to vibrate, which causes them to wring out impurities from the cells and expel them into the blood. These impurities will then be released from your body as you sweat, creating a deep, detoxifying cleanse on the cellular level.</li>
<li>
<strong>Weight Loss</strong> – The human body has an impressive temperature regulation system. It wants to stay at a consistent temperature and its willing to work very hard to ensure that happens. As the body heats up, its natural cooling systems kick in, which take energy and burn calories.  Infrared heat also increases metabolism between the blood and tissue, which also burns calories.</li>
<li>
<strong>Pain Relief</strong> – Infrared heat directly penetrates tissue, muscles and joints, allowing them to heal and regenerate. This is accomplished through a combination of the aforementioned increased circulation, oxygenation and detoxification. Infrared radiation incredibly useful for pain relief for both minor injuries and chronic ailments. It’s no surprise then that infrared heat is often the preferred method of  many physical therapists, saunas and yoga studios around the world.</li>

<h3>Hello my name is Angela McMillian</h3>I'm a mother of three, very caring and professionally diligent. I’m a firm believer in “A family that prays together stays together” and that’s why I want to offer my services to your loved ones. I have decades of experience in certified home care, pro-social family unification and community integrated rehabilitation. As a seasoned professional in the healthcare field, I take great pride in providing the utmost caring, reliable and courteous service to my clients, in addition to being the overall point of contact for operations, personnel, and management. My professional experience includes 20 plus years in Healthcare, Associate Degree of Science from UMA and successful completion of requirements for Certified Medical Administrative Assistant with the NHA. <p>As a passionate and responsible caretaker of my mother for over 15 years, I fully understand the creative adversity it takes to overcome the hardships of caring for a parent or loved one. And, as I recall being a novice, I quickly learned when my mom was diagnosed with ""Alzheimers,"" that not only did her healthcare needs changed but her standard of living needed more than just my spare room. She was different and so were her needs, abilities and interests. From that moment on, I vowed and committed to providing my mother with the highest, quality of care I could provide and what I didn’t know I researched, learned and expeditiously implemented; therefore she could enjoy her last moments with her family, friends and community.</p>
<p>As the number of older individuals in society grows, the needs for private assistance is becoming much more important and a community integrated sociological approach is the new standard of care. At this time, I’m seeking start-up and working capital in order to continue to meet the needs of our friends. We would like to expand our services from a mobile service to a residential program. We’ve  identified a location of interest and am requesting an initial investment of $50.000 for the purchase of property.</p>
<p>We’ve taken great interest in the property and fully intend to rehab the space. Currently the property offers a wide main road with plenty of nature and a secure pavement for outings. Fortunately, the property is vacant therefore with your Angel Investment we can commission a rehab team to completely renovate the 25000, square ft. building and re-facade the space to the loving, caring, innovative social environment we envision for our friends. In addition to your service investment for our friends we will be doing our commercial due diligence to our community by offering new job skills, training and employment satisfaction to the community.</p>

We have a dream of seeing entrepreneurs confidently and proudly using their profession to make a lasting impact on the world.  We believe that you can do this in a way that strengthens the business at the same time.  There are many great examples of this already happening, but we believe it can happen on a much bigger scale resulting in transformational results around the world.  We have, no doubt, an ambitious, long-term plan to get there which includes a creating a transformational business, forming a network of likeminded business people, and a establishing foundation to give entrepreneurs starting small and medium transformational businesses the boost that they need to get on their way.
So that’s super overwhelming and big picture-y!  So why don’t we start small?


In order for our big vision to happen, we first need to build a prototype business that displays the transformational potential of businesses that have a deeper purpose than just financial profitability.  With both of us being passionate coffee drinkers and specialty coffee baristas, we just knew that it would be natural make this prototype business a specialty coffee company.  
Along our journey we discovered the name Narrative Coffee Company.  We were so drawn to this name because we have seen time and time again the potential of when two or more narratives connect.  It happens so often that a brief introduction or connection that we originally don't think of meaning much, turns into something much deeper, long-lasting, and life-altering.  And it all starts when your path or your story connects with someone else’s.  ""Stories connecting"" could mean two people meeting for the first time.  It could also mean someone encountering God for the first time in a tangible way that results in them having a deeper purpose for living.  That is what drives us, and we want to use our coffee shop to create the perfect environment for the connection of stories to take place.  
But why not do this alone?  Well the simple answer is, we are far more effective when we work together collaboratively! This is where you come in!
   What We Need & What You Get 
We believe that we are far stronger when we work together!  Over the past two years, we along with our business developer, consultants, and a team of amazing volunteers, have been putting in the hard work of building the business: tasting coffees, networking with other artisans of all types, developing our business model, and experimenting with different concepts.  We are now ready to open our first coffee bar in September 2016, and now all we need is your help to make this happen.  


We are raising a total of $29,500 USD.  These funds will cover the cost for Narrative’s first coffee bar, machines, brewing equipment, initial stock, reserve operating funds, etc.  Basically everything we need to get the first coffee bar launched and running.
As a heartfelt thank you from us, we would like to give you a token of our gratitude for partnering with us to make Narrative a reality.  Each partnership level comes with a corresponding gift straight from Narrative’s line of lifestyle products.   The Impact By contributing to Narrative, you join us in making an impact on multiple spectrums of society. First, you impact the lives of other entrepreneurs.  Through Narrative's coffee bar and the Narrative Network, entrepreneurs can more tangibly understand that they don't have to leave their profession in order to have a profound impact on the world.  Their calling in the business world is honorable and has a powerful transformational impact.Second, you impact  local communities.  As entrepreneurs realize the transformational potential of their businesses and act on that potential, communities are made stronger and more beautiful.  Third, you impact international communities.  As entrepreneurs become effective beacons in their local community, we challenge them to take it a step further by using their business to transform communities in other cultures.  Often, these are communities that are experiencing difficult living conditions and need someone to have a transformational presence among them.  
    Risks & Challenges  
With any business there are huge risks.  We have been working hard over the past 2 years to minimize the risk of failure.  We have done this by conducting thorough research, listening to the needs and desires of those in our community, and through learning from our friends who already own coffee shops.  
In addition to the business risks, there are also risks that come with empowering and equipping other entrepreneurs to transform communities.  Many of our strategies have yet to be tested, although they were created out of intentional and thorough research we conducted.  Narrative’s culture is such that we aim to fail fast and small, learn from those failures, and then adapt our strategy to become more effective.     Other Ways You Can Help In addition to contributing, you can help also Narrative by being an ambassador for our cause in your social circles.  Promote this campaign among your friends and share updates about Narrative as we journey forward. Your prayers are also extremely crucial.  We cannot accomplish our dreams and goals without God working powerfully in and through Narrative.

supports and implements the ideology of open source
software. According to its developers opinion, the ideology advantages
of open source are in the following: 
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<div align=""justify"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">
Developing and
	using open source software - is one of the ways to the true freedom
	of creativity and mutual assistance in the modern human society. 
	</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align=""justify"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">
Open source
	software allows to the wide range of people to use advanced
	information technology in their work, daily activities and
	scientific research, free and absolutely legal, without severe
	restrictions of proprietary software. 
	</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align=""justify"" style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">
Open source
	software provides greater freedom in developing new technologies and
	improving existing ones. 
	</div>
</li>
<li>
<div align=""justify"">
Open source software can be installed without
	any restrictions, used, modified, distributed in all scientific,
	educational institutions, offices, personal computers, in all
	government and commercial organizations and institutions, according
	to the General Public License GNU (GPL), BSD and others. </div>
</li>
</ul>
<div align=""justify"">
Taking into account all this, we believe that in
scientific research it is often more effective to use open source
software. We suppose that it is easier to build and complete open
source software for the needs of the scientific organizations and
individual researchers, rather than to wait for the owners of
proprietary software to offer necessary additional applications. This
agrees well with an open scientific process of software development
and problem solving, where the speed is important in implementing
solutions and the ability to fix something instantly.</div>
<div align=""justify"">
Currently OpenWebGIS  is still an
insufficiently developed and powerful system, and it still requires
some improvement, but however now, in our opinion, it gives to its
users fast and efficient decisions in some challenges faced by them
in the field of GIS technology.</div>

</div></div>","OpenWebGIS is an open source Geographic information system (GIS). OpenWebGIS was
founded in 2014. Over this period of time, thousands of users have
taken the advantages of this system functions. The site and the blog
have tens of thousands of views. All this time the developers team
has done everything at their own expense, providing a completely free
and open access to the system and its source code. Many new functions
were added and App for Android OS was created.

Thanks to everyone who supported morally
OpenWebGIS all this time. 


Now OpenWebGIS needs funds for a qualitative leap
in its development!

This system has been and will always be free and
open, but the time has come when your support is needed in the form
of financial assistance, in order that the system would continue to
exist, evolve and help you in your work and life with new useful
features. By means of funding you give thanks for the work on the
creation of the existing functions and help in the creation of new
ones. Share our plans and be part of the process! Be involved with
other users who believe in us and share our vision!


The new actively developing GIS called OpenWebGIS
supports and implements the ideology of open source
software. According to its developers opinion, the ideology advantages
of open source are in the following: 




Developing and
	using open source software - is one of the ways to the true freedom
	of creativity and mutual assistance in the modern human society. 
	



Open source
	software allows to the wide range of people to use advanced
	information technology in their work, daily activities and
	scientific research, free and absolutely legal, without severe
	restrictions of proprietary software. 
	



Open source
	software provides greater freedom in developing new technologies and
	improving existing ones. 
	



Open source software can be installed without
	any restrictions, used, modified, distributed in all scientific,
	educational institutions, offices, personal computers, in all
	government and commercial organizations and institutions, according
	to the General Public License GNU (GPL), BSD and others. 



Taking into account all this, we believe that in
scientific research it is often more effective to use open source
software. We suppose that it is easier to build and complete open
source software for the needs of the scientific organizations and
individual researchers, rather than to wait for the owners of
proprietary software to offer necessary additional applications. This
agrees well with an open scientific process of software development
and problem solving, where the speed is important in implementing
solutions and the ability to fix something instantly.

Currently OpenWebGIS  is still an
insufficiently developed and powerful system, and it still requires
some improvement, but however now, in our opinion, it gives to its
users fast and efficient decisions in some challenges faced by them
in the field of GIS technology.


Now the OpenWebGIS users can:


Create, export and add layers in many common
geospatial formats (gml, kml, geoJSON, gpx, shapefile, tiff, arcgrid,
csv, osm), make vector layers with points, lines, polygons, add WMS
layers, use WPS, style their own data, share as embedded maps, share as
web pages, customize Interface, use analysis functions, create 2D,
2.5D and 3D maps. In Android App you can use sensors, WiFi statistic
in you mobile device and refer this data to geographic coordinates. The OpenWebGIS
blog and
a 

full
list of articles about OpenWebGIS provide a lot of information
about possibilities and specific features of OpenWebGIS.



OpenWebGIS is gaining recognition and trust of
highly skilled professionals in the field of Geographic information
system. OpenWebGIS is written about and referred to.

</div><div> <p>I began the tiny little shop in the Underground of Old Seattle two years ago - with zero experience in retail, no understanding of sales, and only a vague inkling of business management. </p>
<p>In those two years, my tiny little shop has become a fixture in Pioneer Square, and my products are sold in several other locations.  I create products for a birthing center, pet stores and a local mercantile.  I ship my teas and balms and tinctures all over the world from our - now quite cramped - apothecary.</p>
<p>I took on apprentices to keep up with demand (now there is an apprentice waiting list!) and every one of us contribute in own way to healing the world one person at a time.</p>
<p>And then, in the midst of the blossoming of my dream - gentrification struck, and our building was sold; our lease terminated.  Time to move?  One month! We have to be completely moved by the 31st of May.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">We know our community needs us...</span></p>
</div><div> <p>There is only one place in our corner of the city where someone can come and speak to an herbalist - in person.  Just one place where everything is made by hand, created to order if need be.  </p>
<p>One place where you know that from field to farm to apothecary, everything is real, everything was grown with care, harvested with care, made by hand.  That's us.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">So many clients rely on us and the products we craft. For us, giving up was never an option.</span></p>

<h3>Determination is key...</h3> <p>Right now, our biggest obstacle is finding the best location to rebuild our shop. Pioneer Square - as much as we love it here - has no small storefronts for lease.  So we have chosen to focus on the nearby International District.  Full of funky little spaces, and diverse cultures...</p>
<p>We think we will fit right into the neighborhood - and hope to be welcomed.</p>
<p>Of course, the other obstacle is having the capital to create a space worthy of our dream.  Not just rebuilding our apothecary, but (with room to grow) we can offer classes, books and spices, resources and information and esoterica for the pagan or spiritual community!  Lots of tea to sip and space to read... a true sanctuary in the city, filled with nothing but good things.</p>

I find that I love it.  I have the opportunity to help so many more people than I ever believed possible.  Every day brings new people for me to share my knowledge with.




Hand crafted Herbal Tinctures

We Need A New Home & Space to Grow...
 I began the tiny little shop in the Underground of Old Seattle two years ago - with zero experience in retail, no understanding of sales, and only a vague inkling of business management. 
In those two years, my tiny little shop has become a fixture in Pioneer Square, and my products are sold in several other locations.  I create products for a birthing center, pet stores and a local mercantile.  I ship my teas and balms and tinctures all over the world from our - now quite cramped - apothecary.
I took on apprentices to keep up with demand (now there is an apprentice waiting list!) and every one of us contribute in own way to healing the world one person at a time.
And then, in the midst of the blossoming of my dream - gentrification struck, and our building was sold; our lease terminated.  Time to move?  One month! We have to be completely moved by the 31st of May.
We know our community needs us...
 There is only one place in our corner of the city where someone can come and speak to an herbalist - in person.  Just one place where everything is made by hand, created to order if need be.  
One place where you know that from field to farm to apothecary, everything is real, everything was grown with care, harvested with care, made by hand.  That's us.
So many clients rely on us and the products we craft. For us, giving up was never an option.
    

Determination is key... Right now, our biggest obstacle is finding the best location to rebuild our shop. Pioneer Square - as much as we love it here - has no small storefronts for lease.  So we have chosen to focus on the nearby International District.  Full of funky little spaces, and diverse cultures...
We think we will fit right into the neighborhood - and hope to be welcomed.
Of course, the other obstacle is having the capital to create a space worthy of our dream.  Not just rebuilding our apothecary, but (with room to grow) we can offer classes, books and spices, resources and information and esoterica for the pagan or spiritual community!  Lots of tea to sip and space to read... a true sanctuary in the city, filled with nothing but good things.


    Everyone matters... Please accept our thanks, in advance if you can contribute to this campaign... however we have never been all that focused on money - so even if you cannot contribute with your dollars, we would sincerely appreciate anyone who can spread the word, share this with their circle, or simply send us your good wishes.  
And do come by the new shop, please, so we can thank you in person and offer a cup of tea to warm you.

Please check back for updates...We look forward to finding our new location, and will be sure to update this campaign with that information (and photos!) as soon as it is cemented.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>MÜV Magazine began as a way to create, collect, curate and share 
inspirational stories and experiences, but as we grow we’re hoping to 
tackle something bigger: We’re hoping to help centralize the discussion 
of parkour culture as it pertains to more than just movement, and expand
 the professional opportunities available.</p>
<p>Our discipline is a 
rapidly emerging and evolving subculture, in much the way skateboarding 
and rock climbing were in decades past: Gyms and parks are sprouting up 
all over the world, practitioners are creating their own fashion brands,
 and major events are held and funded by recognized sponsors every year.
 And as the sport enters the mainstream consciousness it becomes 
increasingly clear that an important transformation is underway.</p>
<p>Our
 subculture is still amorphous, and primordial, and in a constant state 
of being defined and redefined. What really is Parkour culture? In many 
ways we simply don’t know yet, and that’s because it’s still being 
invented! It’s an exciting time, but it’s also a tenuous one in which 
our sport runs the risk of being co-opted by outside forces.</p>
<p>At 
MÜV Magazine we believe it’s important that Parkour culture always 
belong to the practitioners. That the great project of defining our 
movement, our culture and our philosophy always belongs to us! And by 
creating a center for that discourse MÜV Magazine is hoping to help 
democratize the discussion as it moves forward. To help our movement and
 culture always reflect the true spirit of the practitioners and 
athletes who are our readers and contributors alike.</p>
<p>And creating 
opportunities to become a contributor is an important part of our plan. 
Until recently, MÜV Magazine has been a one-man operation run by Andrew 
Obenreder, but after hundreds of lonely hours, MÜV Magazine is finally 
expanding! And building a dedicated staff is just one step in our goal 
to create additional careers paths within parkour.</p>
<p>We want to 
expand professional opportunities, fund projects voted on by the 
community, create a space for the discussion of parkour culture, and 
most importantly, we want to make sure your voice is always a part of 
helping define what parkour truly is.</p>
<p>But in order to achieve all 
of these goals we need your help! While future revenue streams will 
allow us to continue growing and providing a good portion of our content
 for free, we need initial funding to get the process underway! MÜV 
Magazine began as a side-project on a shoestring budget, but has turned 
into something much more than that. Please join us in moving forward. 
Help us to create the first parkour culture platform run by the 
community, for the community. Please donate what you can, become a 
subscriber, share with who you know and follow us on social media to 
join the movement!</p>
<p>It all begins somewhere, and we believe it’s here.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We are looking to raise a minimum of $50,000. We've projected that 
between the original magazine platform and our other in-development 
platforms, we will need to invest roughly $150,000. We know it isn't a 
small amount but we know that with the help of the community we can get 
there. 
</p>
<p>So we're asking for a dollar. If everyone within the community, 
everyone who watches parkour videos, and everyone who supports or enjoys
 our movement gave a single  dollar (an amount that most of us throw 
away or take for granted), we could go above and beyond these numbers to
 create something beautiful together. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Donate Or Subscribe?</h3>

<p>If you donate, you will also receive a subscription for your donation
 level. However, this time around, your subscription will be at least

<p></p>
<h3>Our Current State</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>During our biggest period of development, we hit a plateau and this campaign sprung into existence. Although our team of 9 is currently putting in full-time hours into the project, it simply isn't enough to get it where we want it to be. We're all currently working full or part-time jobs that consume the additional time and resources we have that are needed to continue pushing the project forward to the state that the parkour community deserves and needs. <br/></p>
<p>Outside from this, platform development has come to a crawl. While we had enough knowledge to get the platform to where it is, we're not inherently developers and need some outside help. <br/></p>
<p>We're also currently on cloud shared hosting, which has been great to start but  resource-wise is no longer suitable for the platform. But upgrading to something dedicated, powerful, and scale-able costs a lot more money than we have at the moment and time is running out as our current hosting is up on June 18, 2016. <br/></p>

<ul> </ul> </div> </div>","The Magazine 
MÜV Magazine began as a way to create, collect, curate and share 
inspirational stories and experiences, but as we grow we’re hoping to 
tackle something bigger: We’re hoping to help centralize the discussion 
of parkour culture as it pertains to more than just movement, and expand
 the professional opportunities available.
Our discipline is a 
rapidly emerging and evolving subculture, in much the way skateboarding 
and rock climbing were in decades past: Gyms and parks are sprouting up 
all over the world, practitioners are creating their own fashion brands,
 and major events are held and funded by recognized sponsors every year.
 And as the sport enters the mainstream consciousness it becomes 
increasingly clear that an important transformation is underway.
Our
 subculture is still amorphous, and primordial, and in a constant state 
of being defined and redefined. What really is Parkour culture? In many 
ways we simply don’t know yet, and that’s because it’s still being 
invented! It’s an exciting time, but it’s also a tenuous one in which 
our sport runs the risk of being co-opted by outside forces.
At 
MÜV Magazine we believe it’s important that Parkour culture always 
belong to the practitioners. That the great project of defining our 
movement, our culture and our philosophy always belongs to us! And by 
creating a center for that discourse MÜV Magazine is hoping to help 
democratize the discussion as it moves forward. To help our movement and
 culture always reflect the true spirit of the practitioners and 
athletes who are our readers and contributors alike.
And creating 
opportunities to become a contributor is an important part of our plan. 
Until recently, MÜV Magazine has been a one-man operation run by Andrew 
Obenreder, but after hundreds of lonely hours, MÜV Magazine is finally 
expanding! And building a dedicated staff is just one step in our goal 
to create additional careers paths within parkour.
We want to 
expand professional opportunities, fund projects voted on by the 
community, create a space for the discussion of parkour culture, and 
most importantly, we want to make sure your voice is always a part of 
helping define what parkour truly is.
But in order to achieve all 
of these goals we need your help! While future revenue streams will 
allow us to continue growing and providing a good portion of our content
 for free, we need initial funding to get the process underway! MÜV 
Magazine began as a side-project on a shoestring budget, but has turned 
into something much more than that. Please join us in moving forward. 
Help us to create the first parkour culture platform run by the 
community, for the community. Please donate what you can, become a 
subscriber, share with who you know and follow us on social media to 
join the movement!
It all begins somewhere, and we believe it’s here.

   What We Need

We are looking to raise a minimum of $50,000. We've projected that 
between the original magazine platform and our other in-development 
platforms, we will need to invest roughly $150,000. We know it isn't a 
small amount but we know that with the help of the community we can get 
there. 

So we're asking for a dollar. If everyone within the community, 
everyone who watches parkour videos, and everyone who supports or enjoys
 our movement gave a single  dollar (an amount that most of us throw 
away or take for granted), we could go above and beyond these numbers to
 create something beautiful together.

Our Current State

During our biggest period of development, we hit a plateau and this campaign sprung into existence. Although our team of 9 is currently putting in full-time hours into the project, it simply isn't enough to get it where we want it to be. We're all currently working full or part-time jobs that consume the additional time and resources we have that are needed to continue pushing the project forward to the state that the parkour community deserves and needs. 
Outside from this, platform development has come to a crawl. While we had enough knowledge to get the platform to where it is, we're not inherently developers and need some outside help. 
We're also currently on cloud shared hosting, which has been great to start but  resource-wise is no longer suitable for the platform. But upgrading to something dedicated, powerful, and scale-able costs a lot more money than we have at the moment and time is running out as our current hosting is up on June 18, 2016.

Platform Development
What started simply as an online magazine is quickly developing into the
 first and most comprehensive parkour culture platform covering all 
aspects of our movement: the movement, art, music, philosophy, fashion, 
news, the people, the stories and all the other things that make our 
community unique and ours. Platform development currently consists of finalizing magazine website design, developing the MÜV News, Stereomüv, MÜVD, THEWORLDMÜVS platforms;
 as well as translating the entirety of our platform (websites, 
articles, videos) into Spanish, German, Italian and French (with more 
languages to come in the future).


MÜV News is an international news channel dedicated to parkour culture.  


Stereomüv is a streaming music service for while on the move. The service features the largest curated parkour soundtrack collection, music to train to, artists within the parkour community, and the ability to create your own playlist.

THEWORLDMÜVS is a
 social-creation platform that operates on the sharing of ideas and the support
 of the community to bring inspiring projects to life. Created with 
the intention to keeping our movement and growth in the hands of the community.



The Future & Impact You are helping creating a 
centralized place of discussion for parkour culture, the creation and 
curation of inspiring stories, and the development of something that 
truly represents who we are and what we do. 
What started as a simple side-project grew into something of 
unbelievable magnitude. Something much bigger than myself, than the 
people involved or the community. Something that started for fun has 
become something that I now see will help guide parkour into the future. The Money  Other Ways You Can Help
 Not everyone can contribute and we understand, but that doesn't mean you can't help.    Share on social media, ask your grandma, yell from your rooftop, tell your local communities, post it on the forums (do these still exist?), or ask your friendly telemarketer when he calls. The more people that see this, the more money we potentially can raise.

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p><i>A Personal Note from Mr. Cory, CEO:</i></p>
<p>Dear Cookie Clients and People of the World:</p>
<p>I founded my cookie business when I was 5 years old so that I could buy my mom a car. I was sick of taking the bus to go anywhere, especially in the cold and the rain. Plus, she really deserves it.</p>
<p>We sold our cookies in local farmers markets in New Jersey and New York City, and everybody loved them. Then, in September 2014 my story broke on the Ellen Degenes Show, and it was SOOO cool! I was the happiest kid on earth, and my dreams were coming true. Ellen, Ford and Shutterfly gave me a CAR!</p>
<p>I was also selected to be on Masterchef Junior in the beginning of 2015, and that was GREAT! I learned SO MUCH from Chef Ramsey, Chef Bastianich, and Chef Elliot, and all the other kids on the show. After that, my cookie business went through the roof. I had more orders than haris on my head (that's a lot of orders)! I was so excited for the future of Mr. Cory's Cookies!</p>

<br/><p>But then we ran in to some problems. Growing the business and getting cookie dough available for sale online was a lot harder than we ever anticipated. I like to read about successful businesses, and I read from Mr. Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, that bad stuff happens even in the biggest businesses sometimes.</p>
<p>So we are not ready to give up!</p>
<p>We have had some incredible experiences with the media, which has helped a lot of people across the country learn about our cookies. Everyone wants to try them! We just need the funding so we can make our cookie dough and send it out to you all.</p>
<p>I know there are so many people who love Mr. Cory’s Cookies, and you have already helped take my dream this far. I want to thank everyone who keeps sending us emails and writing to us! You are the best! Thank you for believing in me, my mommy and my Cookie Team.</p>

</p><p>Bonjour ! </p>
<p>Merci d'être venu faire un tour sur la page du ‘’projet’’
Indiegogo de La Bette à Cath, lancée et administrée par la fondatrice Catherine Fortin-Dubé. <br/><br/>
<b>Certains d'entre vous en avez entendu parler, certains s'en doutent et pour
d'autres ... SURPRISE!!! </b></p><b>
</b><p>Un de mes
rêves devient réalité après plusieurs années de préparation mentale, de
formation dans le domaine, de réflexion et de planification... <b>J'ouvrirai finalement mon commerce
alimentaire – La Bette à Cath <b>–</b> cet été! Dès la fin
juin, les habitants et visiteurs de
Notre-Dame-du-Portage pourront profiter d'un Café / Bar à
Jus&amp;Smoothies / Fast-food santé en plein cœur du Village. </b>C'est
donc un projet qui alliera saine alimentation et ambiance décontractée
dans un décor champêtre à seulement quelques pas du fleuve. Tous les mets
du comptoir-rapide seront en formule ''prêt-à-manger'' ou ''à emporter'',
avec un nombre limité de places assises à l'intérieur ainsi que
quelques-unes sur le terrain arrière et la terrasse : <u>faisant face
au fleuve et au coucher de soleil dans les montagnes !</u> Cette offre
alimentaire (et cette expérience) unique à Notre-Dame-du-Portage sera
évidemment la bienvenue tant par les locaux que par
les touristes. </p>
<p>Sur cette page, vous pouvez faire une contribution pour aider le projet, en échange d'une ''contre-partie'' : un/des chèques-cadeaux de la valeur de votre choix. Cette
campagne de socio-financement a deux buts spécifiques:</p>
<p>1. Compléter
le financement de mon inventaire de départ afin que je puisse vous offrir tous
les produits au menu dès la première journée d’ouverture. En effet, les
institutions financières ne finançant pas l'inventaire de denrées alimentaires,
il me manque un petit peu de liquidité pour bien démarrer. </p>
<p>2. M'aider
à bâtir mon ''carnet de commande'' afin de pouvoir confirmer à mes autres
investisseurs que la clientèle est belle et bien intéressée et que la
population de Notre-Dame-du-Portage (de Rivière-du-Loup et
des environs) est plus que prête pour ce type de comptoir alimentaire. Vos
achats m'aideront donc <u>en plus</u> à obtenir le reste du financement dont
j'ai besoin afin d’avoir la liquidité nécessaires aux achats d'ouverture..!</p>
<p>C’est d’ailleurs
une des raisons pour laquelle j’ai choisi de lancer une campagne de socio-financement
et de fonctionner par vente de chèques-cadeaux plutôt que par
donation/prêts/crédits. J'ai effectivement besoin de liquidité
pour acheter mon inventaire alimentaire d'ouverture et fournir quelques
garanties à mes fournisseurs et autres, mais je tiens absolument à ce que
vous obteniez votre ''retour sur investissement''. En achetant un/des chèques-cadeaux, c'est seulement comme si vous pré-payiez vos futures
commandes :)<span></span> et vous pourrez choisir ce qui VOUS
conviendra sur le menu lors de vos visites. La balance des chèques-cadeaux sera remboursable - <u>si vous venez acheter un item
au comptoir</u> : c'est-à-dire que si vous n'utilisez pas votre coupon, il
ne vous sera pas remboursé. Par contre, si vous achetez pour 6.00$ avec un
chèque-cadeau, vous recevrez 4.00$ en monnaie. N'hésitez pas à en acheter pour votre famille et amis. Mon
but premier est bien sûr de vous attirer à venir voir, à goûter mes
produits et à tomber en amour avec La Bette à Cath! <br/>-------------------------------<br/>Pour ceux
qui ne me connaissent pas, j'ai grandi à Notre-Dame-du-Portage et
Rivière-du-Loup avant de quitter la ville quelques années pour Québec et
Montréal. J'ai étudié en Techniques de diététiques (DEC Cégep
Limoilou) ainsi qu'en Sciences de l'alimentation (BAC Université McGill). Alors
que j'ai travaillé comme aide-cuisinière et serveuse pendant mes études,

</div>","Bonjour ! 
Merci d'être venu faire un tour sur la page du ‘’projet’’
Indiegogo de La Bette à Cath, lancée et administrée par la fondatrice Catherine Fortin-Dubé. 
Certains d'entre vous en avez entendu parler, certains s'en doutent et pour
d'autres ... SURPRISE!!! 
Un de mes
rêves devient réalité après plusieurs années de préparation mentale, de
formation dans le domaine, de réflexion et de planification... J'ouvrirai finalement mon commerce
alimentaire – La Bette à Cath – cet été! Dès la fin
juin, les habitants et visiteurs de
Notre-Dame-du-Portage pourront profiter d'un Café / Bar à
Jus&Smoothies / Fast-food santé en plein cœur du Village. C'est
donc un projet qui alliera saine alimentation et ambiance décontractée
dans un décor champêtre à seulement quelques pas du fleuve. Tous les mets
du comptoir-rapide seront en formule ''prêt-à-manger'' ou ''à emporter'',
avec un nombre limité de places assises à l'intérieur ainsi que
quelques-unes sur le terrain arrière et la terrasse : faisant face
au fleuve et au coucher de soleil dans les montagnes ! Cette offre
alimentaire (et cette expérience) unique à Notre-Dame-du-Portage sera
évidemment la bienvenue tant par les locaux que par
les touristes. 
Sur cette page, vous pouvez faire une contribution pour aider le projet, en échange d'une ''contre-partie'' : un/des chèques-cadeaux de la valeur de votre choix. Cette
campagne de socio-financement a deux buts spécifiques:
1. Compléter
le financement de mon inventaire de départ afin que je puisse vous offrir tous
les produits au menu dès la première journée d’ouverture. En effet, les
institutions financières ne finançant pas l'inventaire de denrées alimentaires,
il me manque un petit peu de liquidité pour bien démarrer. 
2. M'aider
à bâtir mon ''carnet de commande'' afin de pouvoir confirmer à mes autres
investisseurs que la clientèle est belle et bien intéressée et que la
population de Notre-Dame-du-Portage (de Rivière-du-Loup et
des environs) est plus que prête pour ce type de comptoir alimentaire. Vos
achats m'aideront donc en plus à obtenir le reste du financement dont
j'ai besoin afin d’avoir la liquidité nécessaires aux achats d'ouverture..!
C’est d’ailleurs
une des raisons pour laquelle j’ai choisi de lancer une campagne de socio-financement
et de fonctionner par vente de chèques-cadeaux plutôt que par
donation/prêts/crédits. J'ai effectivement besoin de liquidité
pour acheter mon inventaire alimentaire d'ouverture et fournir quelques
garanties à mes fournisseurs et autres, mais je tiens absolument à ce que
vous obteniez votre ''retour sur investissement''. En achetant un/des chèques-cadeaux, c'est seulement comme si vous pré-payiez vos futures
commandes :) et vous pourrez choisir ce qui VOUS
conviendra sur le menu lors de vos visites. La balance des chèques-cadeaux sera remboursable - si vous venez acheter un item
au comptoir : c'est-à-dire que si vous n'utilisez pas votre coupon, il
ne vous sera pas remboursé. Par contre, si vous achetez pour 6.00$ avec un
chèque-cadeau, vous recevrez 4.00$ en monnaie. N'hésitez pas à en acheter pour votre famille et amis. Mon
but premier est bien sûr de vous attirer à venir voir, à goûter mes
produits et à tomber en amour avec La Bette à Cath! -------------------------------Pour ceux
qui ne me connaissent pas, j'ai grandi à Notre-Dame-du-Portage et
Rivière-du-Loup avant de quitter la ville quelques années pour Québec et
Montréal. J'ai étudié en Techniques de diététiques (DEC Cégep
Limoilou) ainsi qu'en Sciences de l'alimentation (BAC Université McGill). Alors
que j'ai travaillé comme aide-cuisinière et serveuse pendant mes études,
j'ai par la suite acquis de l'expérience professionnelle précieuse en
gestion de service alimentaire, en nutrition communautaire, en
hygiène/salubrité et gestion de la qualité, en recherche & développement
de produits alimentaires ainsi qu'en gestion de projet pour une multinationale. 

-------------------------------Je suis extrêmement confiante et motivée et je
me sens prête pour mener ce beau projet de front, armée de mes plus

</h3> <p>A ragtag group of pirates searches for buried treasure on horseback.  Elves ride unicorns on a Quest to bring magic back to the land.  This isn't your Netflix queue.  This is what you're doing this weekend.</p>
<p>Themed, costumed trail rides bring fantasy to life, allowing regular folks to indulge in their dreams.  The entire experience, from safety lecture to trail ride, is conducted in costume and in character by our performers.  Participants are encouraged to wear their own costumes.</p>
<p>Unicorn &amp; Centaur is a group of Savannah area riders, trainers, tour guides, actors, puppeteers, teachers, and storytellers.  We are passionate about riding, good horsemanship, and all things fantasy and fiction.  <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Saddle Up!<br/>
</h3> <p>To bring fantasy trail rides to the Lowcountry, Unicorn &amp; Centaur needs more costumes and more horses.  Total startup costs in our initial campaign are $5000.</p>
<p>Trail horses:  We are currently seeking two trail horses.  We are open to rescues and owner surrenders, but the horses must be sound with a rider at a walk and trot.  $1000 for each horse, $100 each for trailer fees.</p>
<p>Tack:  Saddles and bridles.  We have quite a stash of tack, but horses almost always need a new saddle, and little extras like girths and bits will be required, depending on what horses we acquire.  $1200 for trail saddles, $300 for trail bridles, and $300 for bits, girths, saddle pads, and stirrups.</p>
<p>Costumes for horses:  Artax, our unicorn, already has his own costumes.  But the new guys will need fancy duds.  Materials for unicorn and pirate costumes for two horses are $300.</p>
<p>Costumes for humans:  Costume pieces will be provided for participants who don't bring their own.  Helmets with costume helmet covers will be worn by all riders while mounted.  Costume boot covers, plus pieces such as sashes, belts, gauntlets, necklaces, and wigs will be provided.  Helmets are $200, costume pieces are $500.</p>
<p>Donations enable you to enjoy perks such as 50% discounts on trail rides and photography sessions, gift certificates for fantasy trail rides, and even special extras like a video thank you from our puppet fairy godmother, or a gift certificate for a private carriage tour of downtown Savannah.<br/></p>
<p>If our campaign goal is not entirely reached, funds raised will first go to acquiring two great trail horses.  Our herd of horses will be the foundation of all that we do.  Partial funding will not deter us from reaching our goal of fantasy trail rides, however, it just might take us longer to get there.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Wait.  Unicorns?<br/>
</h3> <p>We seek not to compete with the local equestrian community, but to enhance and complement it.  If you are a beginner, we are a safe place for you to learn about horses and riding.  If you are a seasoned rider, we offer you a break from trotting endless circles in the arena.  And we have unicorns.<br/></p>
<p>The alpha mare of Unicorn &amp; Centaur's herd is Michelle Padgett, who has spent the last 18 years entertaining Savannah's people.  Her BFA in theatre helped her write plays for local theatre groups such as the Drama Bums, build and write shows for the Puppet People, and perform in the occasional Murder Mystery with the Odd Lot.  <br/></p>
<p>Michelle has been riding since 1974, and since 2003 has devoted her time to caring for and training Savannah's horses, from Norwood Stables in Sandfly to Historic Savannah Carriage tours downtown, where she works as a tour guide.</p>
<p>Unicorn &amp; Centaur is the culmination of all her life's work.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Real Talk<br/>
</h3> <p> What if you threw a party and no one came?  Of course our biggest fear is that there will simply be no interest in this area for our kind of nerdy fun.  The good news is that, even if trail rides aren't booked, the horses will be fed and worked and cared for.  The horses in our herd, their physical and mental well-being, are our topmost priority, and their care is guaranteed regardless of sales or interest in this project.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways to Help<br/>
</h3> <p>If you can't donate money to our campaign, but you got all excited when you saw pictures of a unicorn and you still want to contribute, don't despair!  Here's what else you can do to help us make this happen:</p> <ul> <li>If you are in the Savannah area and have horses or tack to donate, contact us at unicornandcentaur@gmail.com.  We can travel about an hour to examine/pick up.</li>
<li>We are also accepting donations of fabric, trim, and notions.  If you're in our area, we can come pick it up, email unicornandcentaur@gmail.com.  If you are out of area, send pics of your donation, and if it's on our list, we'll reimburse you for shipping charges.<br/>
</li> <li>Share this page to anyone you think would be interested in our project: equestrians, horse lovers, cosplayers, pirates, princesses, and adventurous souls.  <br/>

<h3>'About NYPD Pizzeria</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>NYPD Pizza has been developing the art of the pizza business
since 1996. Our love for pizza started back in New York City in the 1970’s,
where founder and CEO of NYPD Pizza, Paul Russo grew up in a prideful Italian
neighborhood. He was always surrounded by people who appreciated the experience
and flavorful taste of an authentic New York slice. Call it pride, but we
wouldn’t serve it any other way. Since we started franchising, we have
developed a straightforward system which allows our franchisees to go through
training and utilize the elements we created to operate their own
business. </p>
<p>Our commitment and focus has always been to develop our stores to be a turn-key operation for our franchisees and that is exactly what we have created. From our brand strategy manuals, to our POS software system and restaurant policies; all were designed so that the franchisee would never have to reinvent the wheel. Support, training, national distribution alliances, marketing strategies, and guiding principles are all part of the NYPD Pizza franchise package. There have been modifications to menu items along the way as we grow and thrive, we here at NYPD Pizza constantly develop and research what is best for the franchise system as a whole without compromising our core quality product.</p>
<p>From the first year of stepping onto the pizzeria scene in 1996, we have been awarded scores of awards including Best Pizza in Orlando as well as other cities around the United States more than 30 times. NYPD Pizza has been ranked one of the Top 55 fastest growing franchises in Franchise Times Magazine and listed as a Top 200 Pizzeria in PMQ Magazine. With our many years of experience and dedication, we have looking to expanded the NYPD Pizza Team and brand in select regions of the United States. NYPD Pizza is in the pizza business to give the people what they want, and that’s a Authentic New York slice of pizza! We are devoted to superior customer service and will only use the highest quality ingredients available to produce our menu items. </p>
<p>The NYPD Pizzeria Mission:</p>
<p>“To protect and serve only the best authentic New York style pizza in a family friendly neighborhood atmosphere while committing to provide exceptional service to our customers, franchisees and squad members.” </p>

Risks & Challenges-

With any new business there are definite risk.  However the success rate of a franchise restaurant is much higher than an independently owned restaurant.  Another plus is the fact that NY Pizza Patrol has been in existence in Draper, UT since 2010.  We feel confident that the business will continue to grow.  When challenges do occur we will have the support of the franchiser to help guide us through any unexpected challenges.

I first started experimenting with smoothies at the very beginning of this life-long healthy living journey, and <strong>I simply began by eating more consciously and plant-based.</strong> Years later, my love for eating healthy and creating the most perfectly delicious smoothies and smoothie bowls has grown into an artistic hobby of mine that I very much enjoy sharing with others. Creating beautiful smoothie bowls and experimenting with recipes has become my favorite creative outlet. I have several years of knowledge and experience as a vegan chef, with a primary focus on raw vegan food. <strong>I am dedicated to sharing my knowledge, love for healing food, and Foxy Fruit's delicious edible art creations with everyone.</strong></p>
<p>At Foxy Fruit Bowls &amp; Smoothies, all of our ingredients are nutritious, organic, vegan, gluten-free, and local when possible, because I believe those are the qualities that make food REAL --- <strong>food that has the ability to transform lives and heal bodies.</strong> Every recipe is intentionally created using nutrient-dense superfoods that provide your body the opportunity to achieve optimum health. Each bowl is a unique, mindfully decorated piece of art, topped with organic fresh fruit, gluten-free granola, coconut flakes, and more.</p>
<p>Foxy Fruit, as a whole, truly emanates love and passion. We feel that people are becoming more conscious of the food they eat by making more natural, healthy choices. <strong>Foxy Fruit addresses this growing need for clean, nutritious, and trustworthy food options.</strong> Best of all, our smoothie bowls aren't just food, they are an experience. From the colors, to the taste, we turn our food into edible art, providing an incredible presentation, leaving you satisfied from start to finish. We also serve our product in compostable packaging, our recipes are completely plant-based, are free of artificial juices and sweeteners, and we always have many options to choose from, including ever-changing seasonal recipes by incorporating produce grown by local farms in the Phoenix area.</p>
<p>People all over the world love the concept of smoothies and bowls due to their taste, health benefits, convenience, and natural beauty. The team at Foxy Fruit has a passion to provide this healing food to our community. <strong>We are driven to cultivate inspiring and beautiful vibes that you can feel and taste.</strong></p>

<h2>Our Campaign</h2>
<p>This campaign is important to us because it will not only take our business and passion to the next level, but it will give us a permanent platform to be able to serve our edible art with the community on a daily basis. I have been told many, many times that customers wish they could come get a treat from us whenever they would like. <strong>We very much enjoy serving at occasional local events, however, it would be a dream come true to be able to have a successful brick and mortar in the heart of downtown Phoenix where customers could have easy access to our unique, healthy food option whenever they wish!</strong></p>
<p>The magnitude of this project is huge. This is the biggest and most amazing goal I have ever worked towards achieving. We are extremely grateful for this opportunity and will do whatever it takes to make it happen! The shop we are opening is a small 160 square foot renovated shipping container. It's in the most ideal location in downtown, right off 1st St near Roosevelt Row as well as Arizona State University's downtown campus. Our storefront will be in collaboration with several other locally owned food businesses and stores that will reside in the same complex.</p>
<p><strong>The opening of this shop could have the potential to benefit every single person who lives in or visits Phoenix, and will only add to the artistic, creative, and fun feel that the downtown culture already has.</strong> The craze about our deliciously beautiful food is only growing more and more as days go by, so naturally, the demand for our product is growing with it! This location will be the best thing to ever happen to this daughter and mother team, and will be a truly wonderful addition to this great city.</p>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<h3><strong>Our goal here is to receive support on the funding needed for operating expenses once we open our doors.</strong></h3>
<p>We were blessed enough to secure funding for our equipment costs, however, we need to make sure that we are able to pay our rent, bills, employees, taxes, etc in the first few months <i>(the hardest months)</i> of opening our doors. <strong>The goal we have set here is the bare minimum needed to make sure our expenses are paid for for the first month of operations, in addition to my own personal savings.</strong></p>
<h3>***Even if we reach our goal, extra donations will be used towards ongoing working capital as well - so please do not hesitate to help if/when this campaign goal is reached!***</h3>
<p>We have several awesome perks in store for backers. When you contribute to this campaign, you not only help make this goal a reality, but you also become a collaborator with the Foxy Fruit team. <strong>This IS NOT possible without your support, so we want to make sure you know just how grateful we are for your generosity by giving back in the best way we can!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Your contribution is so very valuable. Opening up a location is not cheap and not easy.<strong> We are humbly reaching out for your help so that we can better serve YOU! </strong></p>
<p>We have had crazy success over the past year. From our very first event at the Full Moon Festival in April 2016, we have had the blessing of gaining a major fan base right off the bat. Over the past year, that fan base continues to grow.<strong> Our product definitely speaks for itself!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Opening up a location does pose risks. The honest truth is that the worst thing that could happen is that we don't make enough money and we have to close our doors. </p>
<p><strong>What qualifies me to overcome these hurdles is my dedication, passion, and willingness to work as hard as I need to be successful. Once I set my mind to something, I make it happen - no excuses.</strong> I am a creative problem solver and a go-getter. My mother is also very resourceful and extremely hardworking.

Hello :) My name is Cameo and I am the co-owner and founder of Foxy Fruit Acai Bowls & Smoothies. I run this women owned startup alongside my mother and co-owner, Julie. What we do is serve high-quality smoothies and smoothie bowls out of a pop-up tent in Phoenix, and it is our mission to provide healing food and edible art. Our goal is to be a positive force in the community by serving beautiful bowls to beautiful souls!
I have been a passionate, healthy living advocate for over 4 years. I was completely self-taught until I attended the Southwest Institute of Healing Arts in Tempe, AZ, and became a certified Holistic Nutrition Specialist.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Dr Mark has been a chiropractor in Raleigh North Carolina for 35 years. He has a wide background from working as a EMT, Physician Assistant, and working in the ER all before settling down in Raleigh and becoming a Chiropractor. Dr Mark had a vision to make a difference in the wellness of people. When Dr Mark met Judi she was able to help him find a way to make that difference. She had worked as a massage therapist, and had worked with many chiropractors, but with her background in business, she knew she would be able to help create the vision that Dr Mark had wanted. Having gone to Cornell University for Hospitality Managements, Judi felt that hospitality needed to be extended to the working class that might not have experienced 5 star amenities.  It made her think what is hospitality really all about. It's about having an enjoyable memorable experience and its convenience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We figured a way to help the working class and keep the cost down was to get a bus. This way we would keep the cost of overhead down and be able to extend good health to the working class that might not been able to afford chiropractic care in the past.  However, it is very expensive to outfit a mobile clinic. We have been fortunate enough to purchase our bus, but still need to raise additional funds to get the bus completely serviced, and built out correctly.  We were also able to come up with some great perks, as a reward for your support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The great thing about our bus is that it could travel all over the triangle and help the working class who couldn't afford to go to the chiropractor because they don't have insurance, it would cost them a days pay, or/and they couldn't leave work for an appointment.</p>
<p>We are also working on becoming a B corporation and help the opioid abuse community with every hundred cracks we give we will give an hour back to the opioid abuse community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Fortunately with eliminating the cost of overhead and being stuck at one general location, we really have eliminated the risk and challenges that some might face. Plus we are really able to extend the savings.  </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>That Book Store's Store(y)</h3>
<p>‘Shop Local’ has become the mantra for successful communities. Although books can be bought online, we know that personal recommendations, not projected by an algorithm, provide more value to the consumer. We understand the frustration of the local community in finding a place where book clubs and those in literature communities can meet. As book lovers and life-long readers, we can anticipate what shoppers hope to find in a local independent bookstore.</p>
<p>Southern Hartford county is a place with only one big box store locally. There is no book store this side of the Connecticut river within an 8 mile radius. That's sad! People of southern Hartford county are smart and know that ""reading is fundamental"". They also know how important small businesses are for a state like Connecticut.</p>
<p><strong>That Book Store</strong> <strong>LLC will be a locally, veteran owned and operated bookstore in Southern Hartford County. </strong>That Book Store LLC will be owned and managed by book lovers who have their finger on the pulse of the book industry. We will bring our unique experience in the book industry to owning and managing a place for book enthusiasts to come and get personalized recommendations from book lovers.</p>
<p>I am Karen Opper, a recent transplant from Florida. I love where we live in Connecticut, in one of the oldest towns in the state, Wethersfield.  It's beautiful here and full of history and culture. We enjoy all 4 seasons and live so close to both Boston and New York. <strong>There is one thing our community is missing though, and that is an independent bookstore.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>About the brains behind That Book Store LLC:</strong></h3>
<p>I have been a book lover my whole life. I blog reviews and book related mind vomit over at <a href=""https://kissinbluekaren.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">KissinBlueKaren</a>. I have been blogging since 2010, and blogging books since 2014.</p>
<p>With me in this venture, is my daughter Belle. Belle is a recent high school graduate of Wethersfield High School. She spent one semester in college in Florida before heading home to help me pursue this dream.</p>
<p>Officially here's our story...</p>
<p><strong>Karen Opper</strong> was an Army Combat Medic and served six years as a Sergeant and Squad leader in the 319<sup>th</sup> Medical Detachment. Karen holds an associate degree from Saint Petersburg College. Karen also graduated with honors and earned an award for Academic Excellence from Southeastern College. Karen is a graduate of the Leadership Distinction Program. Karen has run a successful website, primarily reviewing books and discussing book trends, for the past four years along with being employed full-time for the Veteran’s Administration’s VA Hospital as a nurse.</p>
<p><strong>Isabelle Opper</strong> is a recent graduate of Wethersfield High School. She has volunteered in her school’s libraries for over five years. She was the President of Wethersfield High School’s literature magazine and one of the founding members of Gay Straight Alliance. Isabelle has planned and organized numerous events and is experienced networking within the local community.</p>
<p><strong>With your help, we will bring That Book Store LLC to a place centrally located for the towns of Rocky Hill, Wethersfield, Newington, and Southern Hartford, CT. </strong>This part of Connecticut needs an independent bookstore and we want to bring it to them.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What have we done so far?</h3>
<p>I'm so glad you asked! We have been really busy getting things set up to make That Book Store LLC a reality. Here's what we have done so far...</p>
<p><strong>Legal:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Filed That Book Store as an LLC with the state of Connecticut</li>
<li>Paid for a sales and tax permit with the state of Connecticut (effective 6/1/2018)</li>
<li>Obtained a federal tax ID to pay payroll and federal taxes</li>
<li>Purchased the domain for That Book Store</li>
<li>Purchased an SSL for the store website which includes McAfee security for purchases.</li>
<li>Purchased and set up a website for the store <a href=""https://thatbookstore.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thatbookstore.com</a>
</li>
<li>Studying the resources provided by the Small Business Association.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Community:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Started an <a href=""https://mailchi.mp/68b164eecbcd/tbs-signup"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">email campaign</a> for people to subscribe to for details about progress and events.</li>
<li>Went on a local book store “tour” to see exactly what competition look like.</li>
<li>Set up email campaigns on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and That Book Store’s website.</li>
<li>Spoken with local independent bookstore owners about marketing and things to watch out for in commercial leasing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Financial:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Joined <a href=""http://bookweb.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">American Booksellers Association </a>(ABA is a national not-for-profit trade organization that works to help independently owned bookstores grow and succeed)</li>
<li>Utilized all the free educational offerings on ABA’s website along with bookseller-to bookseller forums to learn more about successful bookselling.</li>
<li>Obtained a SCORE mentor, <a href=""http://www.score.org/mentors/john-molish"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">John Molish</a>, who has over 30 years in the bookselling and publishing business.</li>
<li>Partnered with Libro.fm to offer customers audio books that support That Book Store LLC.</li>
<li>Picked a point of sale system (SquareUP) that is affordable and functional.</li>
<li>Set up accounts with a wholesale book distributors Ingram Content and Baker &amp; Taylor.</li>
<li>Opened a business bank account.</li>
<li>Written up a solid business plan.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need, Exactly</h3>
<p>We did the math, and we need about $100,600 to get That Book Store LLC going.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Books and non-book merchandise</strong>: $35,000 Yea, that's a scary number but we are actually being conservative with that number. We do plan on partnering up with some local companies to carry bookish merchandise along with books new and used.</li>
<li>
<strong>Point of Sale System</strong>: $1,100 Once again, we are being conservative and going with a low cost option that provides the support we need to keep track of inventory and accept payments.</li>
<li>
<strong>Furniture/Fixtures and Store Improvements</strong>: $40,000 This is an approximate dollar amount and we are going to do everything we can to keep under budget for this. No store is ready to go right away. It will need paint and flooring. Books need shelves and we also need decorations, and lighting to create the perfect atmosphere for the store.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, we are not asking for the full amount of these costs. I will be contributing no less than $20,000 of my own money and asking a bank for a loan for the remaining balance. Your contribution means we will owe less of a business loan and be able to invest more to make That Book Store LLC the best it can be.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Hartford County houses approximately 895,000 residents. making it the second-most populous county in Connecticut. An independent bookstore is just what this area needs.</p>
<p>Although the Connecticut market appears to be growing smaller, we believe it will be a wake-up call for Connecticut residents to invest in local businesses and shop local. All the research we have done with Booksellers nationwide has shown that local independent book stores are here to stay and can thrive if they have ties and are invested in their local communities. <strong>We live here and shop here and we want to give southern Hartford the opportunity to have their own independent bookstore.</strong></p>

With me in this venture, is my daughter Belle. Belle is a recent high school graduate of Wethersfield High School. She spent one semester in college in Florida before heading home to help me pursue this dream.
Officially here's our story...
Karen Opper was an Army Combat Medic and served six years as a Sergeant and Squad leader in the 319th Medical Detachment. Karen holds an associate degree from Saint Petersburg College. Karen also graduated with honors and earned an award for Academic Excellence from Southeastern College. Karen is a graduate of the Leadership Distinction Program. Karen has run a successful website, primarily reviewing books and discussing book trends, for the past four years along with being employed full-time for the Veteran’s Administration’s VA Hospital as a nurse.
Isabelle Opper is a recent graduate of Wethersfield High School. She has volunteered in her school’s libraries for over five years. She was the President of Wethersfield High School’s literature magazine and one of the founding members of Gay Straight Alliance. Isabelle has planned and organized numerous events and is experienced networking within the local community.
With your help, we will bring That Book Store LLC to a place centrally located for the towns of Rocky Hill, Wethersfield, Newington, and Southern Hartford, CT. This part of Connecticut needs an independent bookstore and we want to bring it to them.
 
What have we done so far?
I'm so glad you asked! We have been really busy getting things set up to make That Book Store LLC a reality. Here's what we have done so far...
Legal:

Filed That Book Store as an LLC with the state of Connecticut
Paid for a sales and tax permit with the state of Connecticut (effective 6/1/2018)
Obtained a federal tax ID to pay payroll and federal taxes
Purchased the domain for That Book Store
Purchased an SSL for the store website which includes McAfee security for purchases.
Purchased and set up a website for the store thatbookstore.com

Studying the resources provided by the Small Business Association.

Community:

Started an email campaign for people to subscribe to for details about progress and events.
Went on a local book store “tour” to see exactly what competition look like.
Set up email campaigns on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and That Book Store’s website.
Spoken with local independent bookstore owners about marketing and things to watch out for in commercial leasing.

Financial:

Joined American Booksellers Association (ABA is a national not-for-profit trade organization that works to help independently owned bookstores grow and succeed)
Utilized all the free educational offerings on ABA’s website along with bookseller-to bookseller forums to learn more about successful bookselling.
Obtained a SCORE mentor, John Molish, who has over 30 years in the bookselling and publishing business.
Partnered with Libro.fm to offer customers audio books that support That Book Store LLC.
Picked a point of sale system (SquareUP) that is affordable and functional.
Set up accounts with a wholesale book distributors Ingram Content and Baker & Taylor.
Opened a business bank account.
Written up a solid business plan.


What We Need, Exactly
We did the math, and we need about $100,600 to get That Book Store LLC going.


Books and non-book merchandise: $35,000 Yea, that's a scary number but we are actually being conservative with that number. We do plan on partnering up with some local companies to carry bookish merchandise along with books new and used.

Point of Sale System: $1,100 Once again, we are being conservative and going with a low cost option that provides the support we need to keep track of inventory and accept payments.

Furniture/Fixtures and Store Improvements: $40,000 This is an approximate dollar amount and we are going to do everything we can to keep under budget for this. No store is ready to go right away. It will need paint and flooring. Books need shelves and we also need decorations, and lighting to create the perfect atmosphere for the store.

Obviously, we are not asking for the full amount of these costs. I will be contributing no less than $20,000 of my own money and asking a bank for a loan for the remaining balance. Your contribution means we will owe less of a business loan and be able to invest more to make That Book Store LLC the best it can be.
 

The Impact
Hartford County houses approximately 895,000 residents. making it the second-most populous county in Connecticut. An independent bookstore is just what this area needs.
Although the Connecticut market appears to be growing smaller, we believe it will be a wake-up call for Connecticut residents to invest in local businesses and shop local. All the research we have done with Booksellers nationwide has shown that local independent book stores are here to stay and can thrive if they have ties and are invested in their local communities. We live here and shop here and we want to give southern Hartford the opportunity to have their own independent bookstore.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Lean Strategy Masters is an on-line training curriculum designed to help business managers who are responsible for developing company strategy ""master"" successful formation of business strategies.</p>
<p>Why care? Did you know that a recent study of corporate failures showed that 80% of the companies’ lost value was due to poor strategy? That results in corporate downsizing, depressed salaries, and no bonuses. Even if the strategy error is not corporation-threatening, it can force employees to be held responsible for business results that aren’t possible. And the problem is, only 7% of companies are any good at strategy formation, according to this study by PriceWaterhouseCoopers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493667247/c6rygfhmvtfclq2r0pje.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Lean Strategy Masters is designed to help remedy the situation. People who enroll in this training program learn how to implement a novel approach for developing company strategy called the Lean Strategic Decision Model (LSDM). Where is the proof that LSDM can help you? Here is a testimonial from one company.</p>

<p>Lean Strategy Masters is affordable for everyone and any sized company.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>In order to produce Lean Strategy Masters we need $15,000.</p>

<p>We have a wide range of Perks from $15 all the way to $15,000, and a wide range of products from copies of my books, t-shirts, and flash drives all the way up to a  custom LSDM  consult to help your company resolve a strategic challenge.</p>
<p>The most important Perk is the Founding Member. For $395, Founding Members are enrolled into the Lean Strategy Masters training program. Founding members also get access to our monthly webinar where they have the opportunity to ask questions, review new cases or see new training material. And, they’ll receive a free ticket to a full-day Fall, 2017 workshop in Chicago. The Perk cost is 10% of this $4,000 value.</p>
<p><strong>Why Crowdfunding</strong></p>
<p>On-line training programs are becoming increasingly popular. During our research on successful ones, we discovered the following recommendation: ""Don’t invest in developing an on-line training program unless you know that people really have a need for it.""</p>
<p>This makes crowdfunding the perfect way to test our concept in the market before we spend the money to develop it. We believe that the time is right for our training program, and we’re hoping this crowdfunding campaign will validate our belief. And since we are offering a really low cost to Founding Members (i.e., people who are willing to fund Lean Strategy Masters before it has been developed) it’s a win-win situation.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>In our video you learned about Marie being confronted with a strategic challenge and not knowing how to address it. This is a true story, though the name has been changed. From my own observations in business and research conducted to write my books I’ve learned that Marie’s experience is not unique.</p>
<p>When we humans encounter a challenge that we don’t know how to address we find it hard to start. We stress out. But once we see a way to move forward, most of us set off to tackle the problem. It is not knowing how, that stops us. The Lean Strategy Masters program is all about providing a cost-effective mechanism to help business people learn how to approach strategic issues.</p>
<p><strong>A Short Training Module Example</strong></p>
<p>Take a look at this video, which is an example of the kind of education module the Lean Strategy Masters will provide. It is a short 5 minute module that represents the real-world businesses cases that will be contained in the Advanced Perspectives section. Most of the other training modules will use the same format and last about 45 minutes.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/BmGYv67b-Q0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div> <p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The training module content is already developed. So no risk there.</p>
<p>Our biggest risk is developing an engaging set of training modules. We’re pretty sure that you’re not really interested in standard college lectures using PowerPoint slides. To help make sure we deliver on this goal, we’ll be enlisting some of our Founding Members to serve as a beta team. We’ll develop the first course or two and preview the course with our beta testers. Then we’ll assemble their feedback and implement their recommendations.</p>
<p>The other risk is funding. If we can’t reach a minimum number of Founding Members, then we’ll need to evaluate whether the need we see really exists. If we reach a minimum number of Founding Members, we’ll self-fund the remaining costs and deliver the Lean Strategy Masters program.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Now we know that not everyone works in a company position where strategic decision-making training is relevant. But you probably know someone who does.</p>
<p>If you can’t contribute you can still help by getting the word out to people you know who may benefit. Lean Strategy Masters would be great training for small company owners and managers, for entrepreneurs and start-ups, and for companies with revenue between $10M - $100M that may not have a strategy department.</p>

<p><strong>Biography</strong></p>
<p>Steve Garchow is the President at Foresight Business Consulting, a Chicago-based strategy and marketing firm. Steve is obsessed with making a difference in the way companies form strategic decisions. He believes any company can significantly improve performance by implementing a defined strategic decision process, including his own proprietary process, the Lean Strategic Decision Model.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493666694/tcbgmrn4xm0vaypj0k6u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Steve started as a market researcher, eventually building his career by assuming greater marketing and general management responsibility. As VP, Global Marketing for a Fortune 300 company. Steve became intimately involved in strategy formation. Then, as the leader of a multidisciplinary task force established to select the next generation portfolio for one of the company’s half a billion dollar franchises, Steve recognized the need to develop a new decision approach. He developed a process to overcome the team’s problems of incomplete issue framing, inadequate decision criteria identification, endless data collection and detrimental group dynamics. Using this structured approach, his team successfully forged the new franchise. After stints as a senior manager of two start-ups, Steve launched his consulting company.</p>
<p>Steve is the author of two books, the most recent achieving international best seller status. Titled “<i>Stratification: How strategic decision processes will create sustainable competitive advantage</i>,” the book explains the barriers to strategic decision-making and techniques that mitigate them. He also contributed a chapter to another book, ""Elite Entrepreneurs"", where he discusses the importance of improving business strategy.</p>
<p>Since developing LSDM, he has presented the model in seminars, successfully implemented LSDM for clients and counts many companies as experienced LSDM advocates. Steve has discussed his strategy views on numerous radio and television broadcasts.</p>

To help make sure we deliver on this goal, we’ll be enlisting some of our Founding Members to serve as a beta team. We’ll develop the first course or two and preview the course with our beta testers. Then we’ll assemble their feedback and implement their recommendations.
The other risk is funding. If we can’t reach a minimum number of Founding Members, then we’ll need to evaluate whether the need we see really exists. If we reach a minimum number of Founding Members, we’ll self-fund the remaining costs and deliver the Lean Strategy Masters program.
Other Ways You Can Help
Now we know that not everyone works in a company position where strategic decision-making training is relevant. But you probably know someone who does.
If you can’t contribute you can still help by getting the word out to people you know who may benefit. Lean Strategy Masters would be great training for small company owners and managers, for entrepreneurs and start-ups, and for companies with revenue between $10M - $100M that may not have a strategy department.
Help us by telling your network about this campaign.
Biography
Steve Garchow is the President at Foresight Business Consulting, a Chicago-based strategy and marketing firm. Steve is obsessed with making a difference in the way companies form strategic decisions. He believes any company can significantly improve performance by implementing a defined strategic decision process, including his own proprietary process, the Lean Strategic Decision Model.

Steve started as a market researcher, eventually building his career by assuming greater marketing and general management responsibility. As VP, Global Marketing for a Fortune 300 company. Steve became intimately involved in strategy formation. Then, as the leader of a multidisciplinary task force established to select the next generation portfolio for one of the company’s half a billion dollar franchises, Steve recognized the need to develop a new decision approach. He developed a process to overcome the team’s problems of incomplete issue framing, inadequate decision criteria identification, endless data collection and detrimental group dynamics. Using this structured approach, his team successfully forged the new franchise. After stints as a senior manager of two start-ups, Steve launched his consulting company.
Steve is the author of two books, the most recent achieving international best seller status. Titled “Stratification: How strategic decision processes will create sustainable competitive advantage,” the book explains the barriers to strategic decision-making and techniques that mitigate them. He also contributed a chapter to another book, ""Elite Entrepreneurs"", where he discusses the importance of improving business strategy.
Since developing LSDM, he has presented the model in seminars, successfully implemented LSDM for clients and counts many companies as experienced LSDM advocates. Steve has discussed his strategy views on numerous radio and television broadcasts.

Steve earned his B.S. in medical technology from Michigan State University and has a M.H.A. in hospital management from the Ohio State University.",6.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>What’s SEVA Space?</h3>
<p>SEVA Space isn’t your ordinary yoga studio. But it serves some extraordinary, ordinary people. The folks who come here aren’t trend-chasers or Instagram influencers. They’re farmers. Teachers. Healthcare practitioners. Veterinarians. Students. Parents. Grandparents. Great-grandparents. (Possibly great-great-grandparents, too.) </p>
<p>SEVA Space is for everyone. We specialize in true, small-town, Winters, CA hospitality — roll out your mat as a first-timer and you’ll be hard-pressed to avoid making new friends. Our shoe cubbies are home to everything from sparkly flip flops to mud-caked cowboy boots. Attend one of our parties, and you might be coerced into trying someone’s homemade carrot cake or petting a baby lamb from the neighboring pasture. </p>
<p>But it takes a village to raise a village up. “Seva” is a Sanskrit word meaning “selfless service” or work performed without any thought of reward or repayment. It’s the guiding principle that directs everything we do. We’re asking for help in continuing this mission and expanding on what we’re already built.</p>
<h3>What are you doing that's so great?</h3>
<p>SEVA Space is an environment for everyone to feel better physically, mentally, and emotionally. We’re not only committed to the yoga practice, but the people who practice the practice.</p>
<p><i>SEVA Space is inclusive</i><br/>Everybody (and every body) is welcome here. All classes are beginner-friendly. Our instructors focus on safety and wellness over athletic achievement. We offer yoga and pilates, but also restorative classes, senior yoga, and meditation. Here, it’s not about the physical image or even the physical pose — it’s about looking inside, building strength, and trusting the teacher within.</p>
<p><i>SEVA Space is financially accessible</i><br/>It’s 2019 in California. Yoga can be expensive. We do our best to make it affordable. We offer a sliding scale payment structure to accommodate a variety of financial situations, as well as discounts for public servants, students, the elderly, and folks enrolled in WIC and CalFresh. No one is ever turned away.</p>
<p><i>SEVA Space is community-driven</i><br/>We put people first. And we hang out outside of class, too — you can find us out at our favorite local haunts or snacking in the studio after hours (yes, you can eat on the floor). We’ve hosted everything from live music concerts, to fundraisers, to pop-up boutiques, to Refuge Recovery meetings, to nutrition workshops. And we’re always open to new ideas.</p>
<h3>And you need help, you say?</h3>
<p>Yep. In our first year or so, we’ve taught yoga to hundreds of students. We’ve boosted people’s courage and confidence (and the occasional bicep or two). Now, we’re asking for help so we can keep doing this work, expand our services, and kickstart our outreach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cover operating expenses (to take care of the space and our instructors)</li>
<li>Add more classes in different time slots (to make it easier to get to class)</li>
<li>Offer more specialty classes (like yoga for kids or prenatal classes)</li>
<li>Host more retreats (to help people forge lasting connections in beautiful places)</li>
<li>Put on more events (like concerts, wellness &amp; lifestyle workshops, community support groups)</li>
<li>Host guest speakers and guest teachers (a little variety never hurt)</li>
<li>Expand our online presence (by developing instructional videos and other content)</li>
</ul>
<p>By contributing here, you’re not only supporting us, but the entire community we support. And we thank you.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>I am a baker and a farmer. It's time to show my daughter that it is possible to create a living with your own two hands. Foundation to roof, seed to loaf. Bucks and Hunterdon counties lack a wood-fired bakery to provide the community with fresh bread made from locally farmed grains. I want to change that. After two years of small scale baking, building a customer base and restaurant orders, it's time to build a bakehouse and an oven. My neighbor and I are teaming up to put the bakery on his farm. He'll grow the grain, it'll be milled right down the road at a historic stone mill we already work with and sold across the street from the farm at a local farm market where my wife works. Because the majority of my ingredients are sourced locally, even the salt, supporting this campaign is directly supporting small local family farms and a local family owned mill as well as area restaurants. This is a direct injection of capital and good local food into the region.</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $12,000. This is all materials cost for the oven and bakehouse. My wife and I are putting everything we've got into this. Buying loaves up front helps offset this cost. If you used to live in the area and have family here, gift them loaves. Gift friends loaves. Traveling musician? Gift yourself loaves, road food is terrible. I'll deliver wherever, whenever. Live far away? Think of it this way: buying bread is a good excuse to get together for a visit, to bring old friends together, to introduce families. If you'll be on the east coast at any point I'll find a way to deliver your bread to you.</p>
<p>For larger donations I will cook you dinner in the oven and deliver it to your door. All the ingredients used in the dinner will be seasonally fresh and sourced from local family farms.</p>
<p>I will build the oven and the bakehouse myself with the help of friends skilled in the necessary trades---production carpentry, masonry and commercial electricity. Any money raised beyond the materials cost will go toward purchasing seed, wheat and rye, for the coming growing season to supply the bakery. It will also go to upgrading existing equipment needed to run a wood-fired bakery: chainsaws, a wood splitter, a commercial mixer, commercial scales, bannetons, speed racks, sheet pans, hotel pans, flour, salt, a water heater, lighting.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>The impact first is for the community. A bakery like this, with locally sourced and milled grains, acts as a way to support multiple family businesses at once. It is a direct contribution to the sustainability of agriculture, milling and farm markets here. The impact for myself and my family is incalculable. It is self-employment, self-sufficiency. It allows me to show to my daughter, by example, what it means to do for yourself, to make and build and create a life with your own hands.</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The market has been tested and a customer base built. A retail market is already secured, beyond bread subscriptions. Restaurant orders are already secured, one is just waiting on my building a bigger oven so I can bake all the table bread. The mill connection has already been made. My neighbor, who will grow the grain, has been farming grains for 60 years. Because there is not another bakery like this in the area, the demand is here and ready. The labor has been assembled and is ready to work. The real risk and challenge is in my ability to sustain the work in the long run, but when, like my family is, you're putting your life savings on the line there is no room for failure or quitting.</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you can't financially support please spread the word, maybe your friends or family would like good bread or a nice wood-fired dinner. Feel free to gift bread to friends or family.</div></div>","Short SummaryI am a baker and a farmer. It's time to show my daughter that it is possible to create a living with your own two hands.

It is beautiful from seed to suit. It is the oldest plant fiber in continuous use by humans. It absorbs moisture better, dries more quickly, and is one of the strongest natural plant fibers in current usage. You have seen the shiny brown seeds as a food, but you will be enchanted by the rest of the plant. Starting with the graceful long stems waving in the field to the ephemeral blue flowers that carpet the ground only hours after blooming. After harvesting the golden-green stalks are laid out to field rett and age. Then flax is baled and stored. When it is ready, further processing - breaking, scutching, and hackling - produces burnished silver hanks that are spun and woven into linen fabric which can be sewn into a classic summer suit. As if it is still alive, linen clothing drapes and flows on your body similarly to how it blows and waves in the field.</p><p> </p><div><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535501303/s2nr6q5iit7ljr8tzpkq.jpg"" src=""""/></div><div><i>Linen in the Normandie region of France; this is our goal for the Pacific Northwest</i></div><p> </p><p>From the time of the early settlers until the 1960’s fiber flax was a dominant crop in Oregon. During this period Oregon developed the only flax industry in the United States. At its peak 18,000 acres of fiber flax were produced and 14 processing plants were in operation in the Willamette Valley. Fibrevolution is ready to devote time and capital to bringing a flax fiber economy back to the Pacific Northwest. After thoroughly researching the successes and setbacks of the Willamette Valley's historic fiber industry, we believe in the economic and environmental viability of linen.</p><p>We are Shannon Welsh and Angela Wartes-Kahl, co-founders of Fibrevolution. We have the skills and experience to bring linen to market. We want organic, sustainably grown and harvested linen fibers. We want to build an economy that values people, work, plants and the land at every step of the process. Over the last three years we have teamed up with farmers, textile professionals, manufacturers, seed breeders and university researchers in our community who are inspired to participate in the revitalization of flax and linen in the Pacific Northwest. We need your help to purchase the specialized harvesting equipment needed to get the flax out of the ground and ready for processing.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535492740/ajgqkkeyxkg8jhskfdvz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>August 2018 Oregon community fiber flax harvest; photo by John Morgan</i></p><h3> </h3><h3>The Community Impact</h3><p>Natural fibers were integral to our past and now are a hope for the future. Aside from being beautiful, flax is a remarkable crop. It is poised to be a niche regional crop excellent for small-scale farms in Oregon as part of their existing crop rotations. It can be over wintered and dry farmed thereby filling a need for marketable winter crops and saving water. In addition, flax is planted at a high seed density which naturally suppresses weeds. Since flax is harvested by pulling stems directly out of the ground, after harvesting the field is clean and ready for planting.  The processing of flax into linen and many other industrial products is also clean with virtually no waste products.

It is the oldest plant fiber in continuous use by humans. It absorbs moisture better, dries more quickly, and is one of the strongest natural plant fibers in current usage. You have seen the shiny brown seeds as a food, but you will be enchanted by the rest of the plant. Starting with the graceful long stems waving in the field to the ephemeral blue flowers that carpet the ground only hours after blooming. After harvesting the golden-green stalks are laid out to field rett and age. Then flax is baled and stored. When it is ready, further processing - breaking, scutching, and hackling - produces burnished silver hanks that are spun and woven into linen fabric which can be sewn into a classic summer suit. As if it is still alive, linen clothing drapes and flows on your body similarly to how it blows and waves in the field. Linen in the Normandie region of France; this is our goal for the Pacific Northwest From the time of the early settlers until the 1960’s fiber flax was a dominant crop in Oregon. During this period Oregon developed the only flax industry in the United States. At its peak 18,000 acres of fiber flax were produced and 14 processing plants were in operation in the Willamette Valley. Fibrevolution is ready to devote time and capital to bringing a flax fiber economy back to the Pacific Northwest. After thoroughly researching the successes and setbacks of the Willamette Valley's historic fiber industry, we believe in the economic and environmental viability of linen.We are Shannon Welsh and Angela Wartes-Kahl, co-founders of Fibrevolution. We have the skills and experience to bring linen to market. We want organic, sustainably grown and harvested linen fibers. We want to build an economy that values people, work, plants and the land at every step of the process. Over the last three years we have teamed up with farmers, textile professionals, manufacturers, seed breeders and university researchers in our community who are inspired to participate in the revitalization of flax and linen in the Pacific Northwest. We need your help to purchase the specialized harvesting equipment needed to get the flax out of the ground and ready for processing. August 2018 Oregon community fiber flax harvest; photo by John Morgan The Community ImpactNatural fibers were integral to our past and now are a hope for the future. Aside from being beautiful, flax is a remarkable crop. It is poised to be a niche regional crop excellent for small-scale farms in Oregon as part of their existing crop rotations. It can be over wintered and dry farmed thereby filling a need for marketable winter crops and saving water. In addition, flax is planted at a high seed density which naturally suppresses weeds. Since flax is harvested by pulling stems directly out of the ground, after harvesting the field is clean and ready for planting.  The processing of flax into linen and many other industrial products is also clean with virtually no waste products. All parts of the plant have multiple uses. It can be made into home furnishings, apparel, building materials, paper, blended with cotton, wool, hemp and synthetics, and used as laminate for surfboard, canoes, bike frames, mopeds and automobile interiors. Its strength lends it to numerous industrial uses. Oregon farmers are always looking for new crops to add to their rotations, climatic changes require us to consider water needs for future farming, the marketplace is clamoring for regional sources for multi-use raw materials to shorten supply chains and reduce pollution. Organic flax farming in Oregon will be part of a growing international movement to employ regenerative, carbon sequestering farming practices, to onshore small-scale processing and manufacturing of high quality consumer goods, and to create circular economies that take to heart the reciprocity between the health and well-being of the land and the people who work it. What We Need Harvesting linen requires specialized equipment not manufactured in North America. We need to import small-scale flax harvesting machinery from Europe to move our project forward.

<p><strong>SHORT VERSION:</strong><br/>In order to support myself as well as my aging parents, I need to expand my mineral and crystals business by buying top quality material from mines and informal diggings deep in the African bush and deserts. I will need to buy a suitable vehicle to get there as well as bring back large quantities of minerals, crystals and gemstones in order to be viable. Not only will this help me support my family but it will also inject some much needed income into very the rural and isolated communities that dig the rocks, stones and crystals out of the ground</p>
<p><strong>LONG VERSION:</strong><br/><strong>The situation:</strong><br/>I have been making a modest living from supplying rocks, minerals and crystals for over 20 years exept for a period of about 4 years where, due to the world financial crisis in the late 2000's, I had to temporarily sell my soul and sanity by getting a job in the corporate world in order to make ends meet. I HATED every moment of it!</p>
<p>As the world financial situation improved, I managed to fire my boss and resume my passion of playing with rocks and stones for a living and I have specialised in Spirit/Cactus Quartz crystals for the last year or so. I get the crystals direct from the diggings in Mpumalanga - South Africa (about 2,5 hours away from my home) and then spend up to 2 weeks or more putting them through an intensive cleaning process before selling them on either through my website (<a href=""http://www.absolutequartzcrystals.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.absolutequartzcrystals.com</a>) or via Ebay (my Ebay store is at <a href=""http://stores.ebay.com/jimmytherockmonster"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://stores.ebay.com/jimmytherockmonster</a>).</p>
<p>Although these are very popular crystals, they aren't very valuable and so I have to sell a LOT of crystals to meet the monthly bills.</p>
<p>All was good for a long while but about 2 years ago circumstances dictated that I needed to financially start supporting my elderly parents, and there have been many months where sales haven't been good enough to support us all, forcing me to rack up ever increasing levels of debt - to the point where I am forced to seriously consider whoring myself out the in the corporate 9-5 world again just to keep food on the table and keep up with my mom's medical bills. <i>The situation is getting very desperate :-(</i></p>
<p>In order to increase my business and keep my soul intact, I need to start getting a wider variety of more valuable stones and crystals from exotic, far away and hard-to-get-to places such as Erongo, Brandberg, Okaruso, the Kalahari manganese fields and many more.</p>
<p>Sure, I could try buying from a wholesaler middleman - but not only would this increase the prices substantially, it would also lower the quality on the material I could supply because the best pieces always sell first and who knows how many other people would have had time to pick through the batches before I get my turn.</p>
<p><i>I need to be able get to the diggings and negotiate directly with the local diggers to get the best prices and quality.</i></p>
<p><strong>What I need:</strong><br/>I will need a decent second hand vehicle that not only can handle the so called ""roads"" through <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474191237/bpmdsov0cixk7zsrodgx.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>the African bush, it will also need to be tough enough to carry at least several hundred kilograms back home from the middle of nowhere and I will also need sufficient seed capital to purchase a decent quantity of <i>high quality, sought after gems, minerals and crystals</i> in order to be viable. It simply won't be worth it to make such a long journey through the bush for just a few handfuls of stones at a time (and no - I don't and won't deal in diamonds. It's a dirty and unethical business!).</p>
<p>Here's where you come in: I have done the sums and in order to carry on here's what I will need.<br/><br/><strong>$2000</strong> - To start. This will take care of a lot of the bills and allow me the breathing room necessary to avoid the dreaded job in a suit.<br/><strong>$10 000</strong> - Halfway. This will buy me a reliable second-hand off-road vehicle and at least allow me to get to the far flung mines.<br/><strong>$20 000 </strong>- Bingo! Let's go buy lots of rocks :-)</p>
<p><strong>What's in it for you?</strong><br/>As with all Indiegogo campaigns, the primary reward is in helping out a fellow human being in a time of need. In this case you will not only be helping me, but you will also be helping my parents and also help a lot of desperately poor, rural people earn an honest living when I go buy the beautiful rocks they work so hard to dig up.</p>

<p>For larger donations still (and I'm only putting this out there in case somebody is crazy enough and generous enough) not only will I give you first pick of everything and give you discounted wholesale prices in perpetuity - I will also create a professional e-commerce enabled website for you, to your specifications, so that <strong>you can have your own profitable rock, mineral and crystal business.</strong></p>

My name is Kalilah and I am a designer that resides in Baltimore, Maryland by ways of Brooklyn, NY and by ways ways of Jamaica, WI. My parents and I migrated to America, when I was at the tender age of 4. I discovered my interest in art and architecture through my godly mom, Aunty Shirley and my 3rd grade teacher, Ms. Cummings. As I evolved and Ms. Warrick and Ms. Lewis (both teachers I love), nurtured my artistic skills, I went off to graduate from Penn State University with a Bachelors of Art and a Masters in Architecture, 2010. Since then I have worked for major architecture and design companies such as Under Armour and CSD to name a few. </p><p>I've always had a love for architecture and design and that has now translated into fashion! In 2015 I launched my tshirt brand, Mess in a bottle. I am an outspoken individual and I frequently spoke my mind. I began to be expressive on my tshirts and PEOPLE LOVED IT; hence, the birth of MESS IN A BOTTLE. Wear your MESSage.</p><p>I am launching this campaign to grow outside my design room; my ideas are bigger than 150sq.ft. and I NEED YOUR HELP! I do EVERY aspect of my business myself. I print the shirts, put labels on each bottle, put a personalized message in each package, ship, market, etc etc, the list goes on. I AM ONE HUMAN (I think), with 2 hands.

My parents and I migrated to America, when I was at the tender age of 4. I discovered my interest in art and architecture through my godly mom, Aunty Shirley and my 3rd grade teacher, Ms. Cummings. As I evolved and Ms. Warrick and Ms. Lewis (both teachers I love), nurtured my artistic skills, I went off to graduate from Penn State University with a Bachelors of Art and a Masters in Architecture, 2010. Since then I have worked for major architecture and design companies such as Under Armour and CSD to name a few. I've always had a love for architecture and design and that has now translated into fashion! In 2015 I launched my tshirt brand, Mess in a bottle. I am an outspoken individual and I frequently spoke my mind. I began to be expressive on my tshirts and PEOPLE LOVED IT; hence, the birth of MESS IN A BOTTLE. Wear your MESSage.I am launching this campaign to grow outside my design room; my ideas are bigger than 150sq.ft. and I NEED YOUR HELP! I do EVERY aspect of my business myself. I print the shirts, put labels on each bottle, put a personalized message in each package, ship, market, etc etc, the list goes on. I AM ONE HUMAN (I think), with 2 hands.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We want to have more store events, donut parties and make more punny products! But we didn’t have enough space… until now!</p>
<p>Hello! I’m Queenie Best and this is the story of queenie’s cards! The company started off as a side hobby with an online store in 2008 (<a href=""http://queeniescards.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">queeniescards.com</a>), and it continued to blossom into my full-time passion in 2014. In 2017, I opened up my first brick and mortar shop but now in 2019, my growing team and expanding products need more room! After 10 months of searching, I finally found my forever shop! Still located at Danforth/Coxwell, just blocks away from my current store, a glorious 1200 square feet space became available and I just signed the lease! It’s quadruple the space which means quadruple the costs.</p>
<h3>Here is where we need your help!</h3>
<p>We have had incredible support from our customers and fans since the beginning, and we continue to rely on this support - current and new - so we can keep growing. In our new space, we will have a studio area for us to design and work on new projects, a bigger storage for inventory and supplies, and the majority of the main floor will be our retail gift shop where we can display more products for you! We are offering exclusive items in our perks to help us fund this new chapter of queenie’s cards. </p>
<p>Our new location will be at 1808 Danforth Ave in Toronto, just steps away from Coxwell station. We are committed to this place for 5 years so we want to make sure we are doing everything we can to stay for even longer!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>Our goal of $15,000 will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving accessibility by providing a ramp for the entrance</li>
<li>Upgrading security (additional surveillance cameras, locks, gates)</li>
<li>Rent (the new lease is almost triple what we currently pay)</li>
<li>Purchasing new equipment and furniture (such as fixtures, lighting, shelving, displays, tables, chairs, computers, point of sales hardware for merchandise and inventory)</li>
<li>Installing a new storefront sign</li>
<li>Migrating our entire website and online store to a new host so we can list more products for our customers worldwide</li>
<li>General improvements such as painting, patching up holes in the walls, cleaning, etc.</li>
<li>Payroll for staffing (many of you have expressed interest in joining our team, so the bigger we grow the more people we need!)</li>
<li>Inventory of our own line of products (we want to create more amazing products for you!) as well as licensed items (if you’d like us to carry more branded goods from Pusheen, Sanrio, tokidoki, and more, we need the means to do so!)</li>
<li>The fun monthly costs such as legal fees, hydro, heat, taxes, maintenance, insurance... it never ends!</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the funds raised will go directly into the new space. It would be absolutely amazing if we have your support, so in return we have created exclusive perks for you!</p>
<h3>Campaign Perks</h3>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We wouldn't be where we are today without our loyal fans and customers. As a small business, it isn't always easy because we are regular targets to break-ins, shoplifting, scams and copyright infringement. Every dollar helps and does not go unnoticed. All of you have shown so much love for us throughout the years, we intend on returning the favour in every way that we can. We want to continue giving back by supporting our fellow local businesses, artists, designers, customers, our new backers, and to continue working with our friends in the neighbourhood and in the industry. We are always open for collaboration opportunities, and with more resources and more room to express our creativity, the possibilities would be endless! I have a young daughter and as cheesy as this sounds, I want her to see that it’s entirely possible to turn a simple pipe dream into reality with the help of friends, family and people you meet through the love of your creations. I want to keep growing my company to positively influence the power of shopping local and what it can do to revitalize neighbourhoods. Bringing communities together - be it through school fairs, local charities or shopping at each others’ businesses - is what we strive for at queenie’s cards. When we expand into this bigger space, there will be more opportunities to fulfill more dreams.</p>

<h2>American rapper/revolutionary/poet, Tupac Amaru Shakur, wrote an autobiographical poem titled,<i> “The Rose that Grew from Concrete”</i> and it reads: </h2> <p><i>“Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in concrete?

<h2>CREATIVE ENTREPRENEURS</h2>
<p>Hi! We’re Evita Colon and Solise White, Co-Owners of A Concrete Rose Bookbar! We are Afro-Latina performing artists with life missions to empower our community. Born and raised in Lancaster, PA, Evita is a creative entrepreneur, consultant, international poet among other multi-hyphenate creative skills and a mom. Solise is a native of Bronx ,NY, creative entrepreneur, choreographer, director and producer. As CEO and CCO of a creative arts agency, <a href=""http://www.speak2mysoul.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Speak to My Soul</i>,</a> we learned there is a lack of spaces for artists of color to feel free to be themselves as they meet and create. Most importantly, there lacked spaces that gave our artists the opportunity to showcase their work. We decided to create a solution and build that space. With Lancaster, PA's strides toward diversity and inclusion and booming art scene, we felt this space is the missing piece needed to include the African American community, our community, into the narrative. <strong>Representation Matters!</strong> What better way to learn about our culture than reading books by black authors? It was a no brainer to create a space like A Concrete Rose Bookbar! We learned black culture, books, performing arts and wine weren’t just something that we found interesting; it was a shared interest of many of our friends and supporters. As excitement grew of this space, we were motivated to make this happen. Thus, further making A Concrete Rose Bookbar another chapter of our story and hopefully, with your help, it will also be a part of yours!</p>

<p><strong><i>A Concrete Rose Bookbar</i></strong> merges the business concepts of a bookstore, wine bar and live entertainment venue under one roof.

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>If you ask me what MADE. is, I’d say it is a place of hope, community, and discovery.<br/><br/><strong>Hope</strong>….. for future businesses coming into Woodbury  <br/><strong>Community</strong>…. not just a place for the community to shop locally and small (thus supporting the areas’ artisans) but MADE. itself is truly a community of artists and artisans, connected by this quality place to work, sell products and services, and collaborate with one another in their efforts to thrive in their respective crafts<br/><strong>Discovery</strong>….. because not only will visitors find some really cool and unique hand crafted items, but they may also discover their aptitude for creating through one of our workshops, and connect with the creative arts community in the process<br/><br/>I’d like to think MADE. is essentially a small business eco-system, in place to support other small artisan businesses. Currently, our space features original artwork and hand crafted items from 50 of our tri-state artist and artisans, and we are steadily welcoming more! And that’s where we need your help, because we are rapidly outgrowing our space!<br/> </p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>MADE. “Popped up” in late 2017, as a “holiday pop-up shop” with the intent to dissolve on February 15, 2018. However, as the community continued to show their support through shopping at MADE. and even spreading the word to friends and family outside of Woodbury, it became more than apparent that MADE. would make Woodbury, NJ its forever business home. <br/><br/>In 9.5 months, we grew from our initial 20 artists (including myself) to 50 artists/artisans offering everything from artisan body care, jewelry, original artwork, home decor, woodwork, tea blends, and so much more. We have also been able to offer our local artisans a place to hosts crafting workshops for the crafting enthusiast and intimate artist talks and exhibits featuring our local artist and their works in our comfy ""craft-mosphere.""  </p>
<h2>Where we are now</h2>
</div><div>
<p>After assessing our growth and our mission, we realized that we needed to expand our headquarters so that we may fully and effectively live out our mission of becoming a sincere local artisan small business eco-system.<br/><br/>MADE. has found a gem of a space, located feet away from our current space on Broad St. <i><strong>(65 N. Broad St.)</strong></i> that we are working with the property owner to occupy.</p>
<p>In this new space, MADE. will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Welcome more local artisans into our retail space, with a cleaner retail design that offers the artists more opportunity to be hands-on in the design and creativity of the the store</li>
<li>Utilize our 2 new workshop rooms to offer simultaneous workshops and parties/meetings/etc without interrupting floor sales, and build relationships with several senior and special needs communities throughout South Jersey, offering them a wheelchair-accessible area with consistent and engaging classes to stimulate their senses. Our artists will also be able to schedule use of these rooms at their convenience, when they want to host their own workshops/events</li>
<li>Offer 2 additional workspace rooms, where artists will be able to use the spaces to take up residency to create their work and then sell their work on the sales floor</li>
<li>Host art exhibits in a separate gallery/event space</li>
<li>Host vendor/craft fairs in our large parking lot, attracting artisans for major holiday/seasonal events</li>
<li>Employ local residents (thus creating employment opportunities in the City of Woodbury), and offer volunteer hours to local high school students who are interested in the Arts and learning how to run a small business</li>
<li><strong>Annnndddddd….. offer another phase of our artisan eco-system:  Include an ESPRESSO BAR that features locally roasted coffee beans, tea blends, and baked goods, all provided by your tri-state artisans!</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>
<br/>Our Goal</h2>
<p>Since  beginning our journey to expand, we have successfully obtained a commitment from one ""angel investor"" in the amount of $10,000, and we are genuinely hoping that our community can help us fulfill the additional $12,000 that it will take to occupy the space. Your contributions will provide us with working capital for advertising, promotion, and most importantly contracting our artists to contribute their touches to furnish the space.<br/><br/><strong>Our goal</strong> is to raise the funds in the next 38 days, and <u>with your support </u>we will be able to have the keys to the property and start to move into the property---right after the holiday season!!</p>
<p><strong>WITH YOUR HELP</strong>... we will be able to transform MADE. into the ultimate tri-state area destination, where locals and visitors alike know they can stop in to purchase 100% handcrafted goods produced exclusively by local artisans, grab an espresso, latte, or red eye with locally roasted beans, attend an event in a unique and stylish space, or take a workshop and learn from our local artists. You will be helping us not only to continue to stimulate our local and ""shop small"" economy in Woodbury, but also provide our local artisans a quality platform to make a living with their artistry and share it with the world.  And of course, for your donation, we have some really cool rewards! Some of our artisans are also featured in the rewards--<strong><i>c<strong>h</strong></i><i><i><strong>eck</strong></i> them out!</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
</div><div>
<p>When looking for a bigger and more efficient space on Broad Street, we came across few available commercial properties that had the appropriate attributes to suit our specific vision. We knew that we wanted to offer certain types of spaces/resources/services to both our customers and our artisans, and the property needed to be able to accommodate all of those individual factors. When we came across 65 N Broad St, we were first struck by the style/charm of the architecture (We later learned that it is actually a historic building, built in 1901 and built by Benjamin Franklin's nephew! The first senator of New Jersey also resided in this home!), and saw that it was in a very accessible location. We were able to meet and speak with the owner about our plans, tour the space, and everything began to fall into place... Currently, we are working with him as he is renovating the building specifically with MADE. and all of the business and artists needs in mind! Custom fit, just for us!</p>
<p>When deciding to relocate our business, our central focus has been keeping the business in the City of Woodbury; most specifically still on Broad St. If we are unable to raise the funds to occupy this space, we are very unsure when or if we will be able to find the space that suits our mission and thus we will not be able to fully live out our mission. Oh... and did we tell you that this space has FREE PARKING!!!?! That's a big deal!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are the first ones who can say that we understand that money is tight. However, you could still help us in these few FREE ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posting our crowd funder on your FB Page once a week for 4 weeks, encouraging others to donate as much as possible. That's only 4x's, but even with that small act, the added exposure to your network may help us achieve our goal!</li>
<li>Sharing our crowd funder on your Instagram page once a week and putting the link to our crowd funder in your IG bio. This allows people from outside of your normal network, who live around the world see that you are in support of us, and they may want to help as well! GO TEAM!!!!</li>

</div></div>","Who we are
If you ask me what MADE. is, I’d say it is a place of hope, community, and discovery.Hope….. for future businesses coming into Woodbury  Community…. not just a place for the community to shop locally and small (thus supporting the areas’ artisans) but MADE. itself is truly a community of artists and artisans, connected by this quality place to work, sell products and services, and collaborate with one another in their efforts to thrive in their respective craftsDiscovery….. because not only will visitors find some really cool and unique hand crafted items, but they may also discover their aptitude for creating through one of our workshops, and connect with the creative arts community in the processI’d like to think MADE. is essentially a small business eco-system, in place to support other small artisan businesses. Currently, our space features original artwork and hand crafted items from 50 of our tri-state artist and artisans, and we are steadily welcoming more! And that’s where we need your help, because we are rapidly outgrowing our space! 
History
MADE. “Popped up” in late 2017, as a “holiday pop-up shop” with the intent to dissolve on February 15, 2018. However, as the community continued to show their support through shopping at MADE. and even spreading the word to friends and family outside of Woodbury, it became more than apparent that MADE. would make Woodbury, NJ its forever business home. In 9.5 months, we grew from our initial 20 artists (including myself) to 50 artists/artisans offering everything from artisan body care, jewelry, original artwork, home decor, woodwork, tea blends, and so much more. We have also been able to offer our local artisans a place to hosts crafting workshops for the crafting enthusiast and intimate artist talks and exhibits featuring our local artist and their works in our comfy ""craft-mosphere.""  
Where we are now

After assessing our growth and our mission, we realized that we needed to expand our headquarters so that we may fully and effectively live out our mission of becoming a sincere local artisan small business eco-system.MADE. has found a gem of a space, located feet away from our current space on Broad St. (65 N. Broad St.) that we are working with the property owner to occupy.
In this new space, MADE. will be able to:

Welcome more local artisans into our retail space, with a cleaner retail design that offers the artists more opportunity to be hands-on in the design and creativity of the the store
Utilize our 2 new workshop rooms to offer simultaneous workshops and parties/meetings/etc without interrupting floor sales, and build relationships with several senior and special needs communities throughout South Jersey, offering them a wheelchair-accessible area with consistent and engaging classes to stimulate their senses. Our artists will also be able to schedule use of these rooms at their convenience, when they want to host their own workshops/events
Offer 2 additional workspace rooms, where artists will be able to use the spaces to take up residency to create their work and then sell their work on the sales floor
Host art exhibits in a separate gallery/event space
Host vendor/craft fairs in our large parking lot, attracting artisans for major holiday/seasonal events
Employ local residents (thus creating employment opportunities in the City of Woodbury), and offer volunteer hours to local high school students who are interested in the Arts and learning how to run a small business
Annnndddddd….. offer another phase of our artisan eco-system:  Include an ESPRESSO BAR that features locally roasted coffee beans, tea blends, and baked goods, all provided by your tri-state artisans!


Our Goal
Since  beginning our journey to expand, we have successfully obtained a commitment from one ""angel investor"" in the amount of $10,000, and we are genuinely hoping that our community can help us fulfill the additional $12,000 that it will take to occupy the space. Your contributions will provide us with working capital for advertising, promotion, and most importantly contracting our artists to contribute their touches to furnish the space.Our goal is to raise the funds in the next 38 days, and with your support we will be able to have the keys to the property and start to move into the property---right after the holiday season!!
WITH YOUR HELP... we will be able to transform MADE. into the ultimate tri-state area destination, where locals and visitors alike know they can stop in to purchase 100% handcrafted goods produced exclusively by local artisans, grab an espresso, latte, or red eye with locally roasted beans, attend an event in a unique and stylish space, or take a workshop and learn from our local artists. You will be helping us not only to continue to stimulate our local and ""shop small"" economy in Woodbury, but also provide our local artisans a quality platform to make a living with their artistry and share it with the world.  And of course, for your donation, we have some really cool rewards! Some of our artisans are also featured in the rewards--check them out!
 
Risks & Challenges

When looking for a bigger and more efficient space on Broad Street, we came across few available commercial properties that had the appropriate attributes to suit our specific vision. We knew that we wanted to offer certain types of spaces/resources/services to both our customers and our artisans, and the property needed to be able to accommodate all of those individual factors. When we came across 65 N Broad St, we were first struck by the style/charm of the architecture (We later learned that it is actually a historic building, built in 1901 and built by Benjamin Franklin's nephew! The first senator of New Jersey also resided in this home!), and saw that it was in a very accessible location. We were able to meet and speak with the owner about our plans, tour the space, and everything began to fall into place... Currently, we are working with him as he is renovating the building specifically with MADE. and all of the business and artists needs in mind! Custom fit, just for us!
When deciding to relocate our business, our central focus has been keeping the business in the City of Woodbury; most specifically still on Broad St. If we are unable to raise the funds to occupy this space, we are very unsure when or if we will be able to find the space that suits our mission and thus we will not be able to fully live out our mission. Oh... and did we tell you that this space has FREE PARKING!!!?! That's a big deal!

Other Ways You Can Help
We are the first ones who can say that we understand that money is tight. However, you could still help us in these few FREE ways:

Posting our crowd funder on your FB Page once a week for 4 weeks, encouraging others to donate as much as possible. That's only 4x's, but even with that small act, the added exposure to your network may help us achieve our goal!
Sharing our crowd funder on your Instagram page once a week and putting the link to our crowd funder in your IG bio. This allows people from outside of your normal network, who live around the world see that you are in support of us, and they may want to help as well! GO TEAM!!!!
If you know of an angel investor who is looking to help a small business succeed (and receive a return on their investment, of course), please please please contact them and share our info.

<h3>Background: </h3>
<p>Hi! I’m Jeanette Macias a self-taught brewer and co-owner of Seeking Kombucha &amp; Seeking Ferments in Seattle, WA, along with my wife Lyz. We make kombucha &amp; other fermented beverages with ingredients that have been locally sourced by Washington Farmers and other small businesses. We make Kombucha, Jun, Ginger Soda, Tumeric Soda, Kefir, Water Kefir, Kvass &amp; Tepache!</p>
<p>For the past year we have been popping up around the city at local farmers markets and at some of your favorite farmers markets,  breweries &amp; cafes! </p>
<p>It has been such an unbelievable journey and increasingly high demand you all have sought after. We've had wonderful opportunities to collaborate with local businesses and farmers throughout Washington such as The Growler Guys, Chucks Hop Shop, Chubby Bunny Farms, Growing Washington, Hayton Farms, and many more.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583265359/o9fo89kenpcyyxdvheze.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>As a minority (Mexican &amp; Filipino) woman LGBTQ+ owned operation, it’s time to move on to bigger things and set up a permanent home, so that we can continue to give back to the community.</p>
<p>Our vision is to open a fermented beverage taphouse with over 30 different taps, where our amazing community can not only come to get their growler filled, but also stay and hang out because we want to have local farmers &amp; small business pop ups with like minded visions. We also plan to host community classes to help our community grow together such as, "" How to start your own Business"", or classes that promote physical &amp; mental growth. We believe in giving back to our amazing community that has helped us become who we are today. We have seen first hand the disparities and the mountains small minority business have to climb in order to get the resources they need, we want to change that. NO...WE WILL CHANGE THAT. We want to help people who want to start a business but just don't know how, by providing support, guidance, and the resources they need to survive and become successful! As we continue to grow we want to be sure to be able to provide the community the resources they need to grow and survive. This is a safe space for the community where you can come grab a drink or some food, ( we want to invite a food truck roundup) study, hangout, learn something, or just take a break.</p>
<p>The outpouring of support thus far has been surreal, and anticipation for a storefront is high as ever. We owe it to all of you to make this Kombucha bar dream come to life. It is overwhelming and scary, it’s a lot to take on, and we never thought we'd be opening a kombucha bar for the community in the middle of a pandemic, and mass movement for justice &amp; peace– but here we are. We think that our previous life skills (Jeanette -Finance Director for an LGBTQ Non Profit &amp; Lyz -Former Store Manager) we have what it takes to run this Kombucha bar and make this dream a reality.</p>
<h3>The Tap House Details:</h3>
<p>We have over 30+ different flavors of kombucha &amp; Jun! So our goal is to have 30 different taps of Kombucha, Jun, Ginger Beer, Tumeric Soda, Water Kefir, Tepache &amp; Cider. </p>
<p>Not only will you be able to get your growler filled with any of these but also have the option to get a cocktail with ANY of our mixes!</p>
<p>Hungry? Well; we will be selling local small business pastries  &amp; goodies including inviting local food trucks and have community food truck roundups!</p>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>Indiegogo funds will be spent on...</p>
<p> Equipment: Kegerators, filtration system, kegs, refrigerated display case, under counter refrigeration, Keg Taps, Oven, Oven Hood, Fermenters...</p>
<p> Renovations: service counter buildout, new seating area, electrical work for all equipment/lighting, security system updates, minor restroom upgrades, paint, fixtures, new signage, ensuring the space has accessibility </p>
<p>All furniture (tables + chairs) and lighting</p>
<p>Labor + materials</p>
<p>If the goal of $50,000 is surpassed (in which case, thank you all so much!), the extra funds will go toward inventory and a start on rent/utilities as we spend some time renovating the space.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We live in a world where we deal with racism and discrimination on a daily, so we want to help make the world a better place by offering a safe space, not only to hang out, but to also come to learn and grow. Society cannot grow as a whole if we are not willing to be the change we want to see in the world. This is our contribution with your help to not only to provide you with some scrumptious booch &amp; food but to support the small businesses around us as well. We can't do this without all of you, and we are extremely grateful for all your support!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Opening a kombucha bar for the very first time and without any experience is incredibly daunting, especially in a rapidly growing city like Seattle. However, we are so confident in the support from the Seeking Kombucha community, that I know that those people will be there for any guidance and support. We also come from a finance and upper management background which will greatly help us on this new venture we are so eagerly ready for.</p>
<p>Seeking Kombucha is here to stay. We are also fortunate to have friends throughout the community in a wide variety of skills that will help us with some of the renovations and marketing strategies to get up and running. Also a lot of it will also be done personally by us to save on labor and costs where ever  possible. Purchasing used equipment will also help us to stay within budget.</p>
<p>It's so much to take on, but this has been our dream and we are in it for the long run. We are committed to learning and growing to make this business successful. We also would love for this endeavor to include all of you, so we will constantly be sharing updates on Instagram (@SeekingKombucha), and asking for opinions, posting polls, etc…This is a community space so we want to be sure we get the community opinion on designs and space! And we know the result will be beautiful because it'll be a team effort.</p>
<p>We cannot wait to complete the vision and share this space with all of you!</p>

We also plan to host community classes to help our community grow together such as, "" How to start your own Business"", or classes that promote physical & mental growth. We believe in giving back to our amazing community that has helped us become who we are today. We have seen first hand the disparities and the mountains small minority business have to climb in order to get the resources they need, we want to change that. NO...WE WILL CHANGE THAT. We want to help people who want to start a business but just don't know how, by providing support, guidance, and the resources they need to survive and become successful! As we continue to grow we want to be sure to be able to provide the community the resources they need to grow and survive. This is a safe space for the community where you can come grab a drink or some food, ( we want to invite a food truck roundup) study, hangout, learn something, or just take a break.
The outpouring of support thus far has been surreal, and anticipation for a storefront is high as ever. We owe it to all of you to make this Kombucha bar dream come to life. It is overwhelming and scary, it’s a lot to take on, and we never thought we'd be opening a kombucha bar for the community in the middle of a pandemic, and mass movement for justice & peace– but here we are. We think that our previous life skills (Jeanette -Finance Director for an LGBTQ Non Profit & Lyz -Former Store Manager) we have what it takes to run this Kombucha bar and make this dream a reality.
The Tap House Details:
We have over 30+ different flavors of kombucha & Jun! So our goal is to have 30 different taps of Kombucha, Jun, Ginger Beer, Tumeric Soda, Water Kefir, Tepache & Cider. 
Not only will you be able to get your growler filled with any of these but also have the option to get a cocktail with ANY of our mixes!
Hungry? Well; we will be selling local small business pastries  & goodies including inviting local food trucks and have community food truck roundups!
What We Need:
Indiegogo funds will be spent on...
 Equipment: Kegerators, filtration system, kegs, refrigerated display case, under counter refrigeration, Keg Taps, Oven, Oven Hood, Fermenters...
 Renovations: service counter buildout, new seating area, electrical work for all equipment/lighting, security system updates, minor restroom upgrades, paint, fixtures, new signage, ensuring the space has accessibility 
All furniture (tables + chairs) and lighting
Labor + materials
If the goal of $50,000 is surpassed (in which case, thank you all so much!), the extra funds will go toward inventory and a start on rent/utilities as we spend some time renovating the space.

The Impact
We live in a world where we deal with racism and discrimination on a daily, so we want to help make the world a better place by offering a safe space, not only to hang out, but to also come to learn and grow. Society cannot grow as a whole if we are not willing to be the change we want to see in the world. This is our contribution with your help to not only to provide you with some scrumptious booch & food but to support the small businesses around us as well. We can't do this without all of you, and we are extremely grateful for all your support!

Risks & Challenges
Opening a kombucha bar for the very first time and without any experience is incredibly daunting, especially in a rapidly growing city like Seattle. However, we are so confident in the support from the Seeking Kombucha community, that I know that those people will be there for any guidance and support. We also come from a finance and upper management background which will greatly help us on this new venture we are so eagerly ready for.
Seeking Kombucha is here to stay. We are also fortunate to have friends throughout the community in a wide variety of skills that will help us with some of the renovations and marketing strategies to get up and running. Also a lot of it will also be done personally by us to save on labor and costs where ever  possible. Purchasing used equipment will also help us to stay within budget.
It's so much to take on, but this has been our dream and we are in it for the long run. We are committed to learning and growing to make this business successful. We also would love for this endeavor to include all of you, so we will constantly be sharing updates on Instagram (@SeekingKombucha), and asking for opinions, posting polls, etc…This is a community space so we want to be sure we get the community opinion on designs and space! And we know the result will be beautiful because it'll be a team effort.
We cannot wait to complete the vision and share this space with all of you!


Other Ways You Can Help
We do understand not everyone can contribute financially so we ask if you can share this with your family and friends!
We can only grow together so any help is much appreciated!

<p><b>OUR STORY</b></p>
<p>Whether you call it kismet or divine intervention, some kind of magical force brought Mystic Dylan, Jessyica Johns, and Brieanne Kelly together. While each of us has had a different journey until now; we all had the shared vision of opening a store in Santa Clarita Valley. Read more about us below.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595307289/cxotsf2jcz37zdzojfh3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>L-R Brieanne Kelly, Dylan Bauer, Jessyica Johns</i></p>
<p><strong>Dylan Bauer</strong></p>
<p>I always had an attraction to mysticism. At 13, I received my first tarot deck from my mother, and was entranced by their esoteric nature and history. I began to study the cards, and soon sought out other forms of divination: runes, tea-leaf reading, scrying boards, pendulums, palmistry, and throwing bones. I sharpened my craft by giving readings to family and friends and built on that foundation by attending classes in the Occult Arts in Los Angeles, New York, and New Orleans. My connection to mysticism and love for knowledge allowed me to study, explore, and dedicate myself to the art of Witchcraft, as well as Hoodoo, Root-work, and Shamanism. I am a practicing Witch and use the craft to assist me in both my personal and professional life.</p>
<p>Being born with Irish, German, and Native American blood, I attribute my spiritual gifts to my many ancestors who walk and work beside me, guiding me on my sacred journey. I’ve worked professionally for 10 years in both retail establishments and entertainment venues, and my varied background has allowed me to help others with phone and in-person sessions, parties, receptions, séances and other events. I consider psychic readings to be a conversation between the client and the tools. I am an oracle in the purest sense; I convey the information shown to me from the beyond to assist you in finding your path of least resistance. ​</p>
<p>Since childhood I’ve always know that Magic existed. I felt a strong connection to nature and knew that there were things amongst us that we couldn’t see with our eyes.  When I was 9 my mother took me into a local shop in Hollywood that changed my life. Not only did it confirm that Magic existed, but that it was also accessible to us. As I studied and delved deeper into my spiritual path, I frequented a lot of similar shops, but none truly resonated with me. As a professional witch and psychic, I’ve worked in numerous New Age, Occult and Witchcraft establishments. I have an understanding of what people look for in terms of product, aesthetic and quality. I have knowledge of the tools required for specific rituals and have friendships with vendors and other practitioners that will allow this shop to succeed. With my knowledge, practice, and connections I plan to make this shop more than just a retail space, but a community and portal to spiritual guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Jessyica Johns</strong></p>
<p>My wish to open a store stems from the deep want of community; a safe, welcoming place to share space with like-minded individuals and learn from them at the same time. I have been in a constant search for just this, and have come across plenty of wonderful shops, and have met amazing people, including very close individuals in my life, but nothing has endured or stayed constant. This is the true spark of my desire to open a shop! We can create this open, ever evolving safe space for others looking for the same sense of community! And my experience working with amazing companies and creators with III Crows Crossroads will allow me to meet to everyone’s needs. And I hope I can lead you to discover some of the wonderful brands and products out there, and some you didn’t even know existed!</p>
<p><strong>Brieanne Kelly</strong></p>
<p>When I was a teenager, I discovered a store in Los Angeles that changed my life. This store felt like the perfect fit for me; I felt like I belonged among the rows and rows of unique, quirky, and odd gifts! From Tiki glasses, esoterica, hard to find art books, and stickers, you name it. But most importantly, I discovered some of my favorite pop-surrealistic artists there. This store planted a seed in the back of mind to one day open a store of my own, and create a special space which I could pour my heart, soul, and creative passions into, and that was all welcoming for others. However, I didn’t water that seed for many, many years, and I took a few alternate professional paths to where I am now. I’ve worked in sales and marketing, retail, customer service, healthcare and the military (most recently where my path was cut short), and I realized, now, more than ever, was the right time to start a new journey. A la, The Olde World Emporium.</p>
<p>Everything happens for a reason, right? The past seven years I have been serving in the CA Air National Guard. However, I was diagnosed with Epilepsy over a year ago which is a disqualifying condition to stay in the service. When I found out I was being discharged, my gut immediately led me back to the thought of opening up my own shop. As of 30 June 2020, I was officially medically retired from service. I learned so much from my time in the military serving in different capacities, and I am eternally grateful for the friendships I forged in service and the experiences I had. I am proud of what I achieved and the skillsets I obtained (never thought I would have a Security+ certification!) and I hope to parlay these skills into our business.</p>
<p>Life is too short, and I need to follow my intuition and try this new journey. It’s important to me to try and create a legacy in my community, and to set an example for my daughter to never stop living her dreams. Regardless of the actual meaning of the song, there are two lines from Ozzy Osbourne’s “I Just Want You” which is my new motto to live by:</p>
<p>There are no impossible dreams</p>
<p>There are no unachievable goals</p>

<p><strong>THE STORE</strong></p>
<p>We're excited to call 23127 Lyons Avenue in Old Town Newhall our new home! We have found the perfect location; one that is conveniently located just a short drive from Los Angeles and the Valley, in addition to a minute’s walk from thriving Historic Downtown Newhall. Now we need <i>your help</i> in making our dream a reality! We envision a place where people can gather together, connect with their local and global Metaphysical/Mysticism community, and find unique, otherworldly goods to fill your home and your sacred spaces. Take a tour with us and imagine the possibilities.</p>
<p>Having a brick and mortar shop means that we can offer a much wider variety of products. We plan to stock a wide selection of handcrafted goods from across the globe, as well as local creatives including books, candles, tarot decks, art, altar supplies, crystals, home décor, and everything you need to create your own spells, rituals, and charms. In addition, we will be offering a variety of different spiritual services such as: tarot, bone throwing, tea leaves, and palmistry. Even better, we will be working on creating a safe space that will be warm and welcoming where you can relax, have refreshments, and be able to take your time browsing our selections steeped in rich history. The Olde World Emporium invites you to step into the past and shed some light on the present through the many spiritual mysteries that linger inside. More than just a store, The Olde World Emporium is the gateway to an adventure of both mind and spirit.</p>
<p>Can it get better? Yes! Working with many different creatives from around the world, we are pleased to offer curated classes, book signings, exclusive subscription boxes, and our patrons will be able to reserve our space for receptions, parties, and film production. What more can you ask for? How about poetry and open mic nights, new release events, seasonal celebrations. What about a rewards system that earns you credit for future purchases every time you buy something? Or are store credits what you seek? We will be offering all this and more!</p>
<p>On top of being a physical location, we will have a full online store that will allow shopping from the convenience of your home or office no matter where you are in the world. Every product we offer in-store will be available online. However, due to the current situation, we will be working diligently to offer unique classes, limited edition bundles, and one of a kind products online so you can feel like part of our community from the comfort of your own home.</p>
<p><strong>WHY BACK US ON INDIEGOGO?</strong></p>
<p>Well, we plan on being a company accessible to the world, not just our local market, so what better place than Indiegogo that gets visitors from around the globe. Plus, we also want to be a source of support for other diverse spiritual communities and practitioners. We pride ourselves on being friendly and knowledgeable in-store and online. We will always be here to answer any questions and point you in the right direction. Customer service will be our highest priority, and we will work hard every day to earn your business. Finally, not only is our goal to help create our small business, but to financially help other businesses by purchasing products from them or helping generate awareness of their products and talents. We proud to share our core values with you.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Our Core Values</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Practicing with Integrity</i></strong> – We make conscious choices when planning, operating, creating classes, and researching product offerings with a genuine and authentic spirit. We aren’t here to sell snake oil; you can trust us for high quality products and ethical services which we use ourselves. We have hand-picked every item in our store from artisans, practitioners, and craftspeople, near and far, who align with our core values.</p>
<p><strong><i>Customer Service</i></strong> – We hold ourselves accountable and to a high standard. The Olde World Emporium is our home away from home, and we will always treat you as a welcomed guest; everyone is honored and valued (online and in-person). Transparency, open and honest communication is a tenet we thrive by. We believe there is a person behind every transaction. If at any time, your experience is less than pleasurable, we will go above and beyond to make it right. We are here to listen.</p>
<p><strong><i>Dedication to Community</i></strong> – This space is dedicated not only to our ancestors, but yours as well. We dedicate this space to those that follow the beat of a different drum. We acknowledge, accept, and welcome you regardless of race, gender, sex, creed, color, or faith. Throughout history, people have been persecuted for their differences; here we wish them to be celebrated. We do not adhere to any specific spiritual dogma, or practice. This space is intended to bring about community, while also embracing our differences. We do NOT tolerate Racism, Bigotry, Homophobia, Transphobia, or support any Political propaganda. Our mission is solely to elevate and educate the mind, body, and spirit</p>
<p><strong><i>We are a Proud Woman owned/Veteran owned/ LGBTQ Business!</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>OUR GOAL</strong></p>
<p>Small businesses around the world are having economic difficulties and need your support now more than ever. We are so thankful for the support of our community, friends, and family. Opening a store definitely takes a village...but that's the fun part! We will need funding to purchase inventory to fill the store, complete the buildout process, and create the perfect immersive space you’ll never forget and will keeping calling you back. By pledging your support, not only are you backing our small business, but you’re supporting artisans across the globe! Below is what your funds will be helping us achieve.</p>
<p>We are looking to raise $30,000 through Indiegogo and with your help we know we can reach this goal!</p>
<p><strong>Our $30k Goal Will Fund: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Materials and labor for buildout and design</li>
<li>Complete two private reading spaces</li>
<li>Purchase the cornerstone pieces of furniture and custom pieces</li>
<li>Create a beautiful and welcoming indoor space with immaculate attention to detail</li>
<li>Help with our beginning inventory</li>
<li>Create an immersive library and apothecary to serve human connection</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan (and are in the process) to do the labor we can to contribute to fixing up the space (such as painting the walls, installing new fixtures, changing outlets), but some will need to be outsourced to professionals.  If we exceed our goal of $30,000 (oh boy, that would be incredible!) we will use the extra funds for the first months of rent and utilities.</p>
<p>The decision to use Indiegogo to raise funds was made after having so many people reach out us and say that they wanted to help. We have chosen special rewards we feel will really be appreciated by the people who support us and our business; because we want you to feel you’re getting something great back in return for your generosity. No contribution is too small. We are sincerely grateful for you all! We can promise you, if we <i>do </i>reach our goal, there will be many more exciting events and projects to come.</p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>Wow, 2020, Huh! This year has pressed the small business community to its limits. Not just in the U.S., but worldwide. This is our greatest challenge. COVID-19 has been an interesting feat thus far, but with persistence, we will learn to navigate the policies and procedures put in place by our local and state governments. We are encouraged by the strength of our community, and we believe that The Olde World Emporium can overcome.</p>
<p>We know the economy is not at its strongest, but we also feel people need escapes from everyday life and practice self-care, and our space will help provide that. Then there's always a risk in opening a brick and mortar store; especially with so many options for shopping online these days. But we believe that customers have a strong desire to connect with their community, touch handmade products from around the globe in person, participate in special curated classes (when safe), receive spiritual readings, and to learn and deepen their strengths in their crafts in-person. We are SO ready and welcome the challenges.</p>
<p>Additionally, another obvious risk is we will not generate revenue to continue to fund this project which will make it more difficult to open our doors to the public. However, with preliminary social media posts, the interest and responses we have received have all been overwhelmingly positive. With the positive reviews we know this business will be able to maintain its value and continue to serve the community for many years to come. With our combined experience in retail, management, and experience already owning small brands, we are confident we have what it takes to make our store and space successful.</p>
<p>Lastly, as with any project we expect it to be easy and on schedule. But there can be unforeseen circumstances that delay shipping such as printing errors, postal mishaps, etc. These events are outside of our control, but we will do our best to overcome any challenge as quickly as possible with as little impact to our pledges as possible. The Olde World Emporium is our legacy and we will do everything necessary to see it manifested and come to fruition.</p>

We will always be here to answer any questions and point you in the right direction. Customer service will be our highest priority, and we will work hard every day to earn your business. Finally, not only is our goal to help create our small business, but to financially help other businesses by purchasing products from them or helping generate awareness of their products and talents. We proud to share our core values with you.
Our Core Values
Practicing with Integrity – We make conscious choices when planning, operating, creating classes, and researching product offerings with a genuine and authentic spirit. We aren’t here to sell snake oil; you can trust us for high quality products and ethical services which we use ourselves. We have hand-picked every item in our store from artisans, practitioners, and craftspeople, near and far, who align with our core values.
Customer Service – We hold ourselves accountable and to a high standard. The Olde World Emporium is our home away from home, and we will always treat you as a welcomed guest; everyone is honored and valued (online and in-person). Transparency, open and honest communication is a tenet we thrive by. We believe there is a person behind every transaction. If at any time, your experience is less than pleasurable, we will go above and beyond to make it right. We are here to listen.
Dedication to Community – This space is dedicated not only to our ancestors, but yours as well. We dedicate this space to those that follow the beat of a different drum. We acknowledge, accept, and welcome you regardless of race, gender, sex, creed, color, or faith. Throughout history, people have been persecuted for their differences; here we wish them to be celebrated. We do not adhere to any specific spiritual dogma, or practice. This space is intended to bring about community, while also embracing our differences. We do NOT tolerate Racism, Bigotry, Homophobia, Transphobia, or support any Political propaganda. Our mission is solely to elevate and educate the mind, body, and spirit

OUR GOAL
Small businesses around the world are having economic difficulties and need your support now more than ever. We are so thankful for the support of our community, friends, and family. Opening a store definitely takes a village...but that's the fun part! We will need funding to purchase inventory to fill the store, complete the buildout process, and create the perfect immersive space you’ll never forget and will keeping calling you back. By pledging your support, not only are you backing our small business, but you’re supporting artisans across the globe! Below is what your funds will be helping us achieve.
We are looking to raise $30,000 through Indiegogo and with your help we know we can reach this goal!
Our $30k Goal Will Fund: 

Materials and labor for buildout and design
Complete two private reading spaces
Purchase the cornerstone pieces of furniture and custom pieces
Create a beautiful and welcoming indoor space with immaculate attention to detail
Help with our beginning inventory
Create an immersive library and apothecary to serve human connection

We plan (and are in the process) to do the labor we can to contribute to fixing up the space (such as painting the walls, installing new fixtures, changing outlets), but some will need to be outsourced to professionals.  If we exceed our goal of $30,000 (oh boy, that would be incredible!) we will use the extra funds for the first months of rent and utilities.
The decision to use Indiegogo to raise funds was made after having so many people reach out us and say that they wanted to help. We have chosen special rewards we feel will really be appreciated by the people who support us and our business; because we want you to feel you’re getting something great back in return for your generosity. No contribution is too small. We are sincerely grateful for you all! We can promise you, if we do reach our goal, there will be many more exciting events and projects to come.
RISKS AND CHALLENGES
Wow, 2020, Huh! This year has pressed the small business community to its limits. Not just in the U.S., but worldwide. This is our greatest challenge. COVID-19 has been an interesting feat thus far, but with persistence, we will learn to navigate the policies and procedures put in place by our local and state governments. We are encouraged by the strength of our community, and we believe that The Olde World Emporium can overcome.
We know the economy is not at its strongest, but we also feel people need escapes from everyday life and practice self-care, and our space will help provide that. Then there's always a risk in opening a brick and mortar store; especially with so many options for shopping online these days. But we believe that customers have a strong desire to connect with their community, touch handmade products from around the globe in person, participate in special curated classes (when safe), receive spiritual readings, and to learn and deepen their strengths in their crafts in-person. We are SO ready and welcome the challenges.
Additionally, another obvious risk is we will not generate revenue to continue to fund this project which will make it more difficult to open our doors to the public. However, with preliminary social media posts, the interest and responses we have received have all been overwhelmingly positive. With the positive reviews we know this business will be able to maintain its value and continue to serve the community for many years to come. With our combined experience in retail, management, and experience already owning small brands, we are confident we have what it takes to make our store and space successful.
Lastly, as with any project we expect it to be easy and on schedule. But there can be unforeseen circumstances that delay shipping such as printing errors, postal mishaps, etc. These events are outside of our control, but we will do our best to overcome any challenge as quickly as possible with as little impact to our pledges as possible. The Olde World Emporium is our legacy and we will do everything necessary to see it manifested and come to fruition.
