<h3><b>What are the Family Jewels?</b></h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Family Jewels is a large-scale sculptural installation inspired by 70’s-style string art that will debut at Burning Man 2015. Glowing with beacon-like brilliance against the night sky, the installation will stand in steady contrast to the piercing, pulsing Playa horizon. </p>
<p>Unlike their monochromatic string-art predecessors, our plugged-in, amped-up, color-saturated gems will pack a visceral punch with glowing facets and miles of brightly colored strands. They will be a polychromatic vision during the day and emerge as glowing angles of colored, dancing light at night. </p>
<p>The centerpiece is the Crown Jewel, a 12’ tall, four-sided faceted structure composed of triangular wooden “fins” resting on a geometric setting. The walls are coated with phosphorescent paint and glow brightly when exposed to UV or very bright light. UV-reactive glowing tubing wraps around and through the sculpture criss-crossing to create a radiating woven web of lacy geometric dimensional patterns. Edges are defined by LED lights that animate, illuminate, colorize and interact with visitors. Lay down face up on our specialized cart that is part Flintstones, part mechanic’s creeper for a fantastic full-color fluorescent view inside the Jewel. </p>
<p>Flanking the Crown Jewel are two 15-foot tall “solitaires” — simple steel frames wrapped with over a mile of day-glow twine that creates an airy web of luminous color in the day and glows brilliantly at night. The solitaires will be lit by black light floods.</p>
<p>Angular shaped seating allows visitors to sit and stare or lean and gaze as they interact and enjoy the jewels.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h3><b><b>Designs and Prototypes</b></b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Jewels have evolved dramatically over the last eight months. Much discussion, exploration, testing of ideas, and many dead ends have brought us to the current designs. While building has begun, we will continue to test materials, and modify and adapt designs to ensure these jewels sparkle as brightly and safely as possible.</p>

</div><div>
<h3><b>How expensive are these Jewels?</b></h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We have the motivation, the tools, and the skilled volunteers to execute our vision. Now we need to purchase the materials—the wood, steel, and LED lighting, the colorful webbing, UV reactive paint, and materials for the cart-and-track system that will whisk adventurous viewers inside the Crown Jewel.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Your generous donations will help us acquire what we need to make these gems a reality. It will also offset some of the cost of transporting and powering the installation. Every dollar that gets donated goes to add a little more sparkle to the Jewels. It’s all about the 5C’s - Color, Cut, Clarity, Carats, and CASH!</p>
<span></span><p></p>
<p>If we reach:</p>
<p>$7000 - we will enhance the LED lights and add more interactivity </p>
<p>$8000 - will result in brighter lights, and additional smaller jewels</p>
<p>$9000 - we will use glow-in-the-dark laminate instead of paint for the Crown Jewel with more clarity and better color. </p>

How expensive are these Jewels? 

We have the motivation, the tools, and the skilled volunteers to execute our vision.

If we reach:
$7000 - we will enhance the LED lights and add more interactivity

Please note: This fundraiser is NOT raising money to be donated to Bernie Sanders or his campaign. Nor will the advertisement be bought on behalf of them.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am an emerging photographic artist and educator based out of the Phoenix, Arizona area. My artistic research explores the human/nature relationship specific to ideas of mortality, human animality, and the psychological manifestation of the anima.</p>
<p>I was invited to the research residency to study the topic of death called <a href=""http://www.artayatana.com/Mortem.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mortem at Ayatana</a> in Canada this Fall. This residency could not be more perfect for my practice! Attending this residency will not only provide insight to my creative endeavors, but enable forward momentum in ongoing and new bodies of work.</p>
<p>The Mortem residency provides housing and meals in addition to daily research activities a few of which are: visiting a taxidermist studio, learning about traditional and new eco-burial processes, studying 17th century Vanitas collection at the National Gallery of Canada, and a demonstration of hypnosis and past-life regression.</p>
<p>The relatively fast timeline means limited opportunities to access funds for my travel,  so  this Studio Sale was designed to help me get there!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<ul>
<li>The residency will cost $1400, and travel will cost at least $600</li>
<li>You can get a unique work of art from one of two bodies of work! </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As an artist who is still early on in my career, it is vital for me to continue the growth of my practice through residencies, especially cross-disciplinary programs like Art Ayatana Artist Research Program.</p>
<p>This experience will challenge me to push my work in new directions, while also allowing me the opportunity to share ideas with like-minded artists and specialists from around the world.</p>
<p>Additionally, through this residency,  my work will be exposed to a greater audience of patrons, artists, educators and gallerists.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With the tight timeline, it will be a challenge  to reach this goal by the October deadline, which is in under two months. So please consider supporting me by contributing as well as sharing this campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Hello!</strong><br/>My name is Nicole, I am a painter living and working in Baltimore. I graduated from Maryland Institute College of Art with a BFA in Drawing in 2013. Since I have dedicated my time to traveling, lifting heavy things, drinking too much coffee, and painting about it all.   <br/><br/>This past year I have been fortunate enough to spend 6 months as an artist and resident at The Wassaic Projects in Wassaic, NY. Beforehand, I spent a month traveling through Europe with my sketchbook - hitting up Berlin, London, Amsterdam, Venice, and Copenhagen. Embarking on this solitary journey opened my eyes to underdeveloped concepts within my work that had been struggling to burst from tiny, planted, bulbs I had only begun to water. I used the time and space provided by the Wassaic Project to explore, experiment, and unearth these ideas...<br/><br/><strong>And I want to do it again! </strong><br/><br/>Starting in August I will be at Vermont Studio Center (VT), Lighthouse Works (NY), and Glogauair (Berlin!). Through this journey I will continue exploring ideas of intimacy &amp; isolation (or the opposite); material and mark-making; indulgence and restriction, as well as learn from new surroundings and the people I will meet. I will make lots of drawings! I will make lots of paintings! I will explore the world! <br/><br/>It'll be great, <i>basically.</i> <br/><br/><strong>But I need your help! </strong><br/><br/>My paintings reflect a desire to be alive. They are a visual recording of the primal, sensual, and sometimes violent need to be with others. Through this campaign I will continue the critical journey my previous travels have only begun to pathe. I will afford the costs of continuing to push, prod, and respond to the tensions I have recently uncovered within my work. Ultimately, I will gain valuable experience in education, experimentation, and the opportunity to challenge themes of self, community, and sociability within my work. <br/><br/>You can find out more about me and my art here: <a href=""http://nicoledyerart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://nicoledyerart.com</a> or <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/steakbagel/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.instagram.com/steakbagel/</a> here! <br/><br/>And more on my residencies here: <br/>Vermont: <a href=""https://vermontstudiocenter.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vermontstudiocenter.org</a><br/>Lighthouse Works: <a href=""https://www.thelighthouseworks.com/apply/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.thelighthouseworks.com/apply/</a><br/>Glogauair: <a href=""https://glogauair.net/residency/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://glogauair.net/residency/</a><br/><br/><br/><strong>Heres what I need: </strong><br/><br/>If this project reaches its goals at minimum it will fund my residency fee for Glogauair in Berlin. I am fortunate enough to be able to attend Vermont Studio Center and Lighthouse fully funded, but Glogauair does not offer scholarship. I feel that the opportunity to live abroad is worth the money and so I want to make it possible. The residency fee for Glogauair is <strong>900E </strong>a month. The residency provides housing, studio, monthly critique, an open studios event for the public, and additional programming is possible. The euro is currently worth $1.12 so my monthly cost would be approximately <strong>$1007.41</strong> per month. To cover the cost of the residency I would need to raise <strong>$3021. </strong><br/><br/>IF all of you amazing people were able to help me raise ABOVE my asking funds they would cover my travel costs via Uhauls (<strong>~$400</strong>), car rentals (<strong>~$250</strong>), flight tickets (<strong>~600</strong>), SUPPLIES (<strong>tooo much $$</strong>), a few snacks along the way (<strong>FEED ME</strong>), my stupid loan bill (<strong>$340</strong>), shipping work back from EU (<strong>who knows!?!</strong>), and any additional traveling open to me (<strong>Paris!</strong>).<br/><br/><br/><strong>But m not gonna expect y'all to throw your hard earned $$ at me for nothing...</strong><br/><br/>Im excited to be offering several PERKS for the funds!

It explains how the money will be used over the next 18 - 24 months. The written story and the links below focus more on why we are passionate about our mission.)<br/><br/>We’re raising money to turn our current Loafi.com website, over the next 18 - 24 months, into an interactive, user-friendly, online marketplace like none other selling visual art.  The website will be coupled with a matching mobile app for purchasing agility.  We want to connect people who like freshly made art with the visual artist in an environment that will help the people who like art choose and purchase what they like confidently and efficiently.  We will take the online art shop one step further than just introducing artwork and genres.  We will help the buyer get to know the artists; develop and track their own personal art preferences; and help introduce them to new artists and genres through analytics. We find our artists through a grassroots effort, most of whom have no internet presence at all, and support them to share their work safely and profitably without a business degree or web management skills.  We sign people up who like art, regular people, who want to own or give something other than commercially generated art.  We have taken our site as far as we can. We require a bit of professional development and design help. We need a push to get to the next level for the artist and those who like art.  We need a cash infusion into our current efforts to get freshly made original visual art back into the “arts and sciences” for everyday people.<br/><br/>Our mission: Loafi.com is dedicated to providing a community where people who like art can purchase unique, original art to own and give, and where artists can get help one-on-one to develop their talent into an economically viable business. Artists create, others appreciate; we nurture this connection and help with most everything else.<br/><br/>So here is the bottom line and the long story.  We know you are busy, so feel free to read one or both.  We have put in a lot of years and hard work into what we are doing and will take it to the next level – with your help over the next 18 - 24 months. <br/><br/>Bottom line - our goals include:<br/><br/>·  Support visual artists to make a living utilizing their talent, starting with, but not limited to “undiscovered” artists, especially women artists<br/><br/>·  Help more people enjoy the societal, emotional and intellectual benefits of original art by making freshly made original visual art readily available and affordable via user-friendly methods<br/><br/>·  Employ people, over time, who need flexible work schedules, flexible work environments, supportive team environments and/or need to build work history while life is happening, i.e. artists, vets, caregivers, stay-at-home parents, retirees, students<br/><br/>We have our 5-year, big picture, business plan and our day-to-day, operational action plans prepared, and started, with methods, processes and techniques in place to support our team, the loafsters, in the field. We are on our way, but we need a financial boost to finish and maintain the interactive, user-friendly, marketplace website and mobile app. We want to be THE online mart for unique, original art. And, we want to get going before a money-laden person and/or organization steals our idea purely for profit … we know, it’s a slightly paranoid statement, but the art world has a lot of money surrounding it and we want to control the win for the artists, the loafsters and everyday people who like art. We’re in it for the long haul, but we really need a boost right now. Any amount will help.<br/><br/><br/>Long Serious Story<br/><br/>The Long Serious Story starts with Mama Loaf. Mama Loaf graduated from high school in 1950 starting an art degree at the University of Minnesota. After repeated pestering from others in her life (a common occurrence for women at that time in history), she switched to a nursing degree and became a Registered Nurse. Educated women were expected to become a teacher, nurse or other “temporary” position until they were married, then stay at home with the children and take care of her husband and the household. Even then, the perspective was ""what respectable person in our society became an artist?"" Certainly, there was no money to be made in such a career that doesn’t really “do” anything.  A “starving artist” was generally the expected outcome. Well, Mama Loaf, as a nurse, ended up raising two children alone following a divorce. After 40 years, she picked up the charcoal again. Few of her early charcoal drawings exist, because of multiple moves and a shortage of space on the moving trucks. At one point, her family’s books were more important than her drawings.  Mama Loaf is our inspiration and the reason for our resolve. After speaking with hundreds of artists over the past 14 years and researching art’s impact on our world, we decided there must be a way to make our idea of a win-win-win work. We are doing just that. But, we need your help to keep on keeping on.<br/><br/>While the well-researched reasons that underlie this mission started with Mama Loaf, the larger picture reasons presented themselves pretty quickly.  Original visual art, itself, is an important aspect of our culture, our heritage, and our history.  The artists, or those who create, are a critical part of our collective past, present and future. Visual artists create art that defines our current state of affairs. No matter who you are, what you do, or where you live, artists are one of us. Owning and giving original art in efforts to support these artists who define us needs (yes, needs) to become an everyday occurrence. Artists supply a product in original art that is a crucial part of our society and deserve to be paid accordingly through the sales of their original art. Women artists especially need a helping hand. In 2012, of the top 500 artists sold by value, 19 were women. That’s 3.8%. In 2012, none of the 100 highest grossing art auction sales included a female artist. In 2012, of the top 86 most highly visited solo art exhibitions in the U.S, 26% were shows by women artists. Program enrollment for a Master of Fine Arts is typically 65 %-75% female, yet 70% of gallery space belongs to art by men. We are here to help women where we can. We are here to help all artists regardless of their training in art. Where <i>are</i> all the women artists, regardless of training? … Women, more times than not, are responsible for child-rearing, elderly parent care and other care-giving roles which remove or delay them from money-making opportunities.  Oftentimes, when the time to move into an increased money-making situation occurs, the timing in life demands that women drop out of their art careers to care-give and/or to get a “steady” job that pays the ever present bills that are often associated with care-giving. Family comes first. We are here to make a difference for these women. While half of our mission is to individually assist all artists in developing their talent into an economically viable business, the other half of our mission is to enhance everyone’s life through original art. Original art is as individually important to owners as it is societally significant. Children and adults of all ages benefit psychologically and intellectually from viewing and experiencing original art.  Our culture, our brain function and our economy are all enhanced when we own original art. We believe an interactive, user-friendly, online marketplace is an important part of supporting our goals.<br/><br/>Our mission, our legacy … your legacy … should you choose to help us, to join us, is dedicated to providing people with unique, original art to own, give and pass down to our next generations while assisting visual artists in developing their talents into an on-going economically viable business.<br/><br/>Artists create … others own and give … artists gain ... we all gain.<br/><br/>We at Loafi.com have developed the necessary methods, processes and techniques to successfully accomplish our goals. We have put them in play, but need a boost for the next steps. We are financially committed, but need additional funding to finish, first and foremost, our interactive, user-friendly website, and matching mobile app. Any amount will help us accomplish this over the next 18 - 24 months.<br/><br/><br/></div>","(The above campaign video focuses on where the money will be spent as we thought it important that you know where your money is going.

</div></div>","SUMMARYHi I’m Patrick Fisher and I’m the creator of Gamut.  Gamut is about healthy lifestyles and creativity, staying active and fit in a variety of ways, and surrounding yourself with others who do the same.  In college, I studied business/economics and philosophy, and found a passion for personal training, music, and art. This mix led to the creation of Gamut and now my new goal of opening The Gamut Compound. We call it The Compound for short.That's where Barrett Colvin comes in.  We met at a local screen printing warehouse and realized we share a passion for art, fitness, good vibes, and super cheesy old hardcore metal! He has been an in-house designer at Neff Headwear since 2011 and he is a freelance designer for many more big hitters including Beloved, Epitaph, and Into The AM.  He also has his own clothing line called The Feed. Barrett wanted more than the typical office work grind and we both have wanted our own spot for a while now.  We talked about collaborating and recently decided to pull the trigger. OUR MISSIONThis campaign is about establishing an environment to create art, hang out, and connect with others, but we need your help to make this dream a reality. The Compound will be a fun workspace to chill, meet people, have art shows, gatherings, movie nights, you name it. The Compound is a place to unlock our unlimited creative potential.Your contributions will mean so much to us. As some of you may know already, I decided a few years back that I would create my own way independent of the status quo. It has given me a huge sense of freedom and confidence. It has been my dream for years to have a place where people can go and feel that way too. The Compound is that place. We can create the best art, talk with each other, bring back that human element and connection here, with no judgment. The Compound is for people who want to learn from one another; for freethinkers and artists at heart. Please consider contributing to this movement and watch it snowball.  We need your help!WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GETWe have a bunch of renovations to do to make the compound look legit! We need funds for couches, projectors, art supplies, electrical work, etc. Anything helps. And straight up, we are giving out amazing gifts of art, apparel, and headwear in exchange for your donations!

In any given workshop, students may be analyzing rap lyrics for various literary devices; writing their own poetry or raps based on prevalent themes in their lives or in Hip Hop culture; researching the history of Hip Hop, especially in Detroit; learning different techniques about the process of writing, drawing, rapping or dancing; and providing critiques and feedback to their peers regarding performance skills. </p>

<p>I've been a <a href=""http://DoniaLilly.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">professional artist</a> since graduating 15 years ago with a degree in Studio Art. I am also the founder &amp; producer of the <a href=""http://KauaiArtTour.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kauai Art Tour</a> ~ Artists Open Studios event. Recently I was invited to be a part of a beautiful book featuring 50 artists from Hawaii entitled ""Aloha Expressionism."" </p>
<p>An exhibition for all of the artists in the book will be mounted at the Hawaii Food &amp; Wine Festival's ""Corks and Forks"" event on Oahu in September with a silent auction benefiting culinary &amp; agricultural charitable organizations in Hawaii. It's the first time art will be featured along with the food &amp; wine at this world renowned festival.</p>
<p>I need to send my art to the exhibit, and since it's framed with expensive museum glass, the safest way to do this would be to take it with me on a plane. In addition to the safety of the art, my being at the event personally will greatly enhance the chances of someone purchasing my work (people love meeting the artist &amp; talking story about the art) either at the event or in the future.</p>

You may even be able to ask a question and get some sort of answer. It may be funny, absurd, magical, and/or eerily relevant.  Of course, remember that this particular psychopomp shifts between 5 main aspects:  a crone, a child, a trickster, an escort, and the aurora borealis.  So you never know who you are going to get, or what kind of message/answer will present itself.  So roll the trickster's magical dice, and partake in the magical potential of this particular transition.   And even if you can't support financially, there are other ways.  Please share this campaign with others who might enjoy interacting with the Psychopomp.  OR: maybe  you have an extra backback, or laptop in excellent condition.  Things like this would also help offset my expenses.Thank you!* A Psychopomp is a shapeshifting traveller who moves in between the worlds, escorting souls in transition from one world to another.** As you may or may not know, I work primarily with the transgender and gender variant community, a community of which I am part.  I believe that the voice that is resonant with your identity is already there - it just needs to be found and liberated.

On the off-chance that we don't, my name is Casandra Johns and I am a new mama and book artist in the Salem/Portland area. Just about two years ago I decided that I wanted to learn to independently produce small-scale publications on subjects that I find interesting and inspiring, from esoteric studies to art and herbalism. About a year ago, I applied to OCAC, th Oregon College of Art and Craft, and was accepted with a generous scholarship into their Book Arts program. I anticipated starting school in the fall of 2014. The spring prior to my first semester though, I realized I was pregnant with the wonderful, beautiful, charming Madrona! School was put on hold. It was well worth it, and if everything goes as planned I will begin school this coming fall. However, I am itching to begin making books!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291104/files/20150312181846-work_station_3.jpg?1426209526"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>I have so many projects
floating around in my crazy brain just waiting for the perfect ingredients and materials to be in the right place at the right
time so that they can come into existence. Sometimes it gets
overwhelming, feeling so inspired but often lacking a sufficient outlet. I
print cards and bind blank books and that's fun, but I want to be
doing <i>so much more</i>. So, while
sitting in my little home with Madrona and staring at all of my
binding supplies the other day, I realized I was incredibly anxious.
Why was I anxious? I couldn't shake it. I realized that it was because
I just need to begin. I just need to go for it! I need to pick the
project that is the most accessible and take the step to BEGIN once
and for all. I priced my supplies and drew a mock-up and started to
get really excited when I remembered the obnoxious fact that, in
order to do anything more than dream and plan, I would need some money...</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p><b>Asking for money is so difficult!</b>
</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p>It's
true. I feel like I'm terrible at it and get so worked up and feel so guilty and
struggle with my sense of worth, my sense of confidence in my
project, but I just have to do it. A friend lent me the excellent
book <u>The Art of Asking</u><span>
by Amanda Palmer, which has been really helpful and inspiring in
gaining the courage to do this.</span></p>
<p><span>So
here I am asking for your money. But what for? How much do I need?
How will I use it? In order to embark on the journey toward my grand
dreams of independent publishing and high-quality bookbinding, I will begin with one project, something small and accessible.
The idea is that, once it is underway, the resources it brings in can
go toward funding another slightly more ambitious project, then
another slightly more ambitious, etc. <br/></span></p><p><span><br/></span>
</p>
<p><span><b>Here are the details...</b></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Any money
you donate will go directly into supplies for printing a small
children's book which</span><span> is something I am </span><i>very</i><span>
enthusiastic about as a new mama, artist, and herbalist. It w</span><span>ill be a short book all about gardening and growing seeds. However,
it won't just be </span><i>about</i><span>
gardening, it will be a DIY kit for the whole family to garden
together! It will include original block-printed images of seven
easy-to-grow herbs coinciding with each color in the rainbow, as well as seed packets of each plant. Families will be
able to start the seeds together and watch them grow! And once the
flowers bloom, the block-printed images are perfect as a template so
that kids can color in the flowers they have been tending. The book
will also include fun project ideas and information about each plant.
An example: </span>
</p>
<p>“<i>Calendula
is a sunny, sticky flower that blooms yellow and orange. The flower
petals are tasty in salad and can be used as medicine! If you get a
scrape or bug bite, try mashing up calendula and applying it gently
to your skin. It will help you feel better and make everything heal
faster. If you are getting a cold, try making a tea from the
beautiful flowers. It will help with swollen, sore throats and stuffy
noses. PROJECT IDEA: When a bunch of your calendula flowers have
bloomed, pluck them off the stocks and set them out on a cookie sheet
to wilt for a day or two. Then, put all the flowers in a canning jar
and cover them with oil. Make sure you shake it around to get out the
air bubbles! Leave your jar in a warm, dry place for two weeks and
shake it every few days. After you've waited, strain out the oil.
Make sure to squish the flowers through something like cheesecloth to
get all the medicine out. Label your jar, and presto! You've made
your very own healing oil! It is good for cuts, scrapes, burns, dry
skin, bug bites, rashes, and so much more!”</i></p><i></i>
<p><span>Not
only will this book be fun and interactive, but it will be beautiful!
The flower images will be block prints and the book hand-bound and
hardback. The spine will be exposed, which means that when you open the book, it's
flexible spine allows it to lay flat to make reading and coloring
easier. Seed packets and instructions will accompany each plant
picture in a fun and handy pocket page. In it's entirety, I envision
creating a lovely, functional piece of art that is accessible and
enjoyable for kids as well as parents.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1291101/files/20150312181622-california-poppy.jpg?1426209382"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p><br/></p><p>Now
you know what I'm doing, but how will I use your dollars? I will put them entirely toward supplies! I sat down and priced out
everything I need to print this book in a run of 35 copies and it
will be between $250 and $300, not including shipping. This includes everything like glue,
paper, bookboard for the covers, waxed linen for binding, ink, blocks
to carve the images on, seed packets, etc. Now, Indigogo allows a minimum goal of
$500 for their campaigns, so any money I receive past my personal
$300 goal will either be used to print a second run of this exact
book if there is demand for it, or go directly into the other publications projects I will be
putting the profits from this book toward. It's important to me that
you understand that this book and any money you may donate is not
just a one-time deal for me. It's like a seed! It is the beginning of
something much bigger that I have been dreaming up for the last two
years, something I am about to invest three years of my life going to
school to study. It is how I eventually would like to support myself, my
daughter, and indirectly, my community.  
</p>
<p><b><br/></b>
</p><p><b>Will
you help me plant the seeds and watch them grow?</b></p>
<p><br/>
</p><p>What
can you expect when you donate? First of all, you can expect to hear
that I have printed and bound a book by (ideally) July 1<sup>st</sup>.
Second, if you make a donation using one of Indigogo's “Perks”
options, I am using this as a venue to pre-order books and prints.
For a $20 donation, I will send you an original block print of one of
the images from the book. For a $35 donation, you have pre-ordered a
book and you will be the first to receive it once they are completed.
For a $50 donation, it's the book and a print for you. If you would
like to donate more and want a book and/or print, I am happy to set
them aside for you. If you would like to donate less, that's great
too. Perhaps you will want to purchase a book once they are
completed, or perhaps you are just happy to help. No matter which way
you go, I'm so grateful!</p>

<p>One of the goals of Galerie Pavlova was to challenge any preconceived notions people may have had about photography from Australia and New Zealand.  <br/></p>
<p>The Spring Salon featured a diverse mix of conceptual, landscape, portrait and classical work of the following Australian &amp; New Zealand photographic artists:</p>

<p>The opening reception of <i>Typologien</i> was well received, bringing together five different photographers who could share their experiences of each project.

<p>We wanted Galerie Pavlova to go beyond the traditional exhibition space; it should also be a window to Australia &amp; New Zealand, a place for cultural exchange where visitors can experience photography in a way they would not otherwise be able to.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the <a href=""http://www.galeriepavlova.com/?p=351"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Typologien</a> group exhibition of Berlin based artists we hosted out first <a href=""http://www.galeriepavlova.com/?p=819"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">artist talk</a> with Zoe Spawton, Conor Clarke and Nadine Hattom. </p>

</div><div>Therefore, in return for supporting our campaign, we would like to provide this unique opportunity for artists working within the medium of photography to have their work viewed by the gallery.</div>
<h4>How does this work?</h4>
<div>Similar to when you submit your work to a competition or to a portfolio review, we would ask that you prepare a selection of your images that you would like to receive feedback for, in addition to:</div>

<h4>Why is this useful?</h4>

We <a href=""http://www.galeriepavlova.com/?p=657"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interviewed</a> him about his included series <i>Safety by Numbers</i> and we spoke about his latest project THE POEMS which is currently on show at <a href=""http://www.photowerkberlin.com/pages/projektraum"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Projektraum | PhotoWerkBerlin</a>. </div><div>THE POEMS is a unique photographic experiment in portraiture, where Boris produces an image that is the product of his subconscious mind interacting with the subconscious of his subject. </div><blockquote>I am trying to get a map of psychological or unconscious, subconscious archetypes that I react to. I have done it for the last two years using Tumblr, intuitively liking images that I respond to, without thinking about it. Every 6 weeks I look at all of my likes and try to analyse, why did I like it? What is the structure and how many similar images did I select before? So I came up with about 30 categories or more and this is a kind of map of the images that I respond to on an intuitive level. When I work with models I send them this list and ask them to select 5 categories that are the most interesting to them. Out of those 5 categories they get 5 images each that I collected from tumblr. Then they need to pick the images that they respond to the most. This creates a cross over between their subconscious and mine and it’s from these images that I start creating the staged photography from. </blockquote><div>For a limited time, it is possible to experience this process first hand, as Boris has kindly donated 3 photo shoots to the campaign.

</div></div>","In brief
Berlin based Galerie Pavlova is calling on your support as it enters its second year of operation with big plans for 2015.Following an intense first year we are planning to maintain this momentum as we further establish Galerie Pavlova as a premier platform for showcasing contemporary photography from Australia & New Zealand within Europe.
After having presented a number of established and emerging photographic artists to a warm reception at our home on Linienstraße, we are now working towards participating in our first Art Fair dedicated to promoting photography.Galerie Pavlova is completely self funded and like many artists we represent, we depend on alternative sources of income (teaching, consulting, lighting design) in order to keep the gallery open. 
It is for this worthy cause that we're reaching out to the greater artistic and photographic community for your support.



The story so far

It has been almost a year since we presented Between Worlds from Polixeni Papapetrou and realised our goal of establishing Berlin's first and only gallery dedicated to presenting contemporary photography from Australia & New Zealand. 
Between Worlds - Polixeni Papapetrou


The first vernissage and grand opening of Galerie Pavlova was complemented with German wine from a small independent winery, and mini-pavlova from which our gallery for Australian & New Zealand contemporary photography takes its name.

  

In the last 12 months we've presented four unique and well received photography exhibitions; hosted an artist talk; conducted a number of interviews; participated in local art tours; collaborated with a number of our neighbourhood galleries; developed our own signature gin; and started a collection of photography books. 
Frühlings Salon (Spring Salon)

Following our first exhibition and coinciding with the 10th annual Berlin Gallery Weekend, the Frühlings Salon (Spring Salon) was a presentation of 20 different photographic artists from Australia & New Zealand. 
    


One of the goals of Galerie Pavlova was to challenge any preconceived notions people may have had about photography from Australia and New Zealand.  
The Spring Salon featured a diverse mix of conceptual, landscape, portrait and classical work of the following Australian & New Zealand photographic artists:



Donna Bailey


Jessie Boylan


David Collins


Michael Corridore


Sharon Danzig


Tara Gilbee


Nadine Hattom


Derek Henderson


Alexander James


Ingvar Kenne


Bronek Kozka


Becky Nunes


Polixeni Papapetrou


Isobel Parker Philip


Clare Rae


Jacob Raupach


Talia Smith


Anita Totha


Lesley Turnbull


Kylie Ruszczynski


Typologien



Typologien was our first group exhibition featuring the work of three Australian, one New Zealand and one German visual artist who are all living and working in Berlin. 
By an interesting coincidence, each of the artists in this show had produced a series which was reminiscent of the German photographic tradition established by August Sander and Bernd & Hilla Becher - typologies.


The five photographers featured in this exhibition were:


Boris Eldagsen - Germany


Conor Clarke - New Zealand


Henry Trumble - Australia


Nadine Hattom - Australia


Zoe Spawton - Australia




  
The opening reception of Typologien was well received, bringing together five different photographers who could share their experiences of each project. The many visitors also gained valuable insight into these works, discovering the amount of time and research dedicated to producing a photographic typology. 


Transcendental: New Australian Abstract Photography



The final exhibition for 2014 was a group exhibition of new Australian abstract photography, under the title Transcendental. This exhibition presented work which challenges both the limits and expectations of the photographic medium.
  

Transcendental presented the works of the following five Australian visual artists, working with photography:

Jacqueline Ball
Michael Corridore
Tara Gilbee
Isobel Parker Philip
Kate Robertson


----------------------------------------
Other milestones throughout the year

We wanted Galerie Pavlova to go beyond the traditional exhibition space; it should also be a window to Australia & New Zealand, a place for cultural exchange where visitors can experience photography in a way they would not otherwise be able to.
Coinciding with the Typologien group exhibition of Berlin based artists we hosted out first artist talk with Zoe Spawton, Conor Clarke and Nadine Hattom. 

  
We also took the opportunity to visit each of the Berlin based artists at their studios or apartments, giving additional insight into their respective projects and photographic work, through a series of portraits and interviews. 


As the gallery is not only a place for showcasing contemporary photography, but also a platform for collaboration and cultural exchange, we have taken the opportunity to work together with some of our favourite neighbourhood galleries.


   Together with the team at Michael Reid Berlin, we designed and produced a small map of the Berlin-Mitte gallery district. For the Spring and Autumn gallery season we have had the pleasure of bringing together the following galleries and institutes:

ifa-Galerie (Institut für Auslandsbeziehungen)


Rasche Ripken


Martin Mertens


Galerie Hiltawsky


Loris


Robert Morat


Galerie für Moderne Fotografie


pavlov's dog


Michael Reid Berlin


janinebeangallery


Podbielski Contemporary


Pinter & Milch


  
Another popular highlight was our collaboration with local gin distiller Alchemist who helped us develop our signature Galerie Pavlova Gin, infused with Australian botanicals and available exclusively through the gallery. 
We have also started a small collection of Australian & New Zealand related photographic publications available for purchase.

Why do we need your support?
Last year we turned to INDIEGOGO to help launch Galerie Pavlova and we'd once again like to call on the community to help us enter our second chapter. 

This year we are planning to take part in the inaugural Photo London Art Fair for contemporary photography. This will be a huge undertaking for the gallery and a very important step in establishing our presence in the European art community. 

Participating in an Art Fair is an enormous investment for a gallery, the upfront costs can be very intimidating and there is no guarantee that work will be sold. In addition to these fees, work will need to be transported from Berlin to London, as well as travel and accommodation costs for our staff to attend. 

Though on a positive note, participation in  Photo London will allow the artists presented by the gallery to reach a very exclusive audience of photography collectors and aficionados, who are devoted to supporting photographic art. 
It is for this reason that we once again call on the wider community to help us achieve this goal. 
What we can do for you
Since opening the gallery we have received many requests from artists, both in person and via email, to review and exhibit their work. In the beginning this was easy for us to manage, however due to the number of requests we now regularly receive, it is unfortunately no longer possible nor feasible for us to accommodate and respond to these enquiries.

   
Therefore, in return for supporting our campaign, we would like to provide this unique opportunity for artists working within the medium of photography to have their work viewed by the gallery.
How does this work?
Similar to when you submit your work to a competition or to a portfolio review, we would ask that you prepare a selection of your images that you would like to receive feedback for, in addition to:


Link to your website or online portfolio


Artists Statement


Biography

Any specific questions that you'd like addressed

Once the above information has been received, we will conduct a preliminary review of the submission, compiling a list of notes and comments about your work.Following this we will arrange an appointment for a 20 minute Skype consultation in which you will have a chance to speak about your work and receive valuable feedback from the gallery.To complete this process will be sending a follow up email with useful links and resources for promoting and improving your work.
Why is this useful?

Over the years, we as artists have all paid to submit our work to portfolio reviews and photography competitions, only to receive a rejection letter in return, with no explanation as to why the work was not accepted. This can be both frustrating and disheartening, not to mention a time consuming and costly exercise. 

To coincide with our campaign, we would like to offer an alternative to this one way submission process; providing valuable feedback to your work and a positive investment in your own artistic practice.

Photo shoot with Visual Artist Boris EldagsenWe first showed the work of Berlin based visual artist Boris Eldagsen in our Typologien group show mid 2014. We interviewed him about his included series Safety by Numbers and we spoke about his latest project THE POEMS which is currently on show at Projektraum | PhotoWerkBerlin. THE POEMS is a unique photographic experiment in portraiture, where Boris produces an image that is the product of his subconscious mind interacting with the subconscious of his subject. I am trying to get a map of psychological or unconscious, subconscious archetypes that I react to. I have done it for the last two years using Tumblr, intuitively liking images that I respond to, without thinking about it. Every 6 weeks I look at all of my likes and try to analyse, why did I like it? What is the structure and how many similar images did I select before? So I came up with about 30 categories or more and this is a kind of map of the images that I respond to on an intuitive level. When I work with models I send them this list and ask them to select 5 categories that are the most interesting to them. Out of those 5 categories they get 5 images each that I collected from tumblr. Then they need to pick the images that they respond to the most. This creates a cross over between their subconscious and mine and it’s from these images that I start creating the staged photography from. For a limited time, it is possible to experience this process first hand, as Boris has kindly donated 3 photo shoots to the campaign. This includes a made-to-measure photo shoot utilising the process outlined above, and a print from the collaboration.Limited edition prints exclusive to the campaignAlso featured as part of Typologien group exhibition of Berlin based photographers, Conor Clarke and Henry Trumble have each donated exclusive limited edition prints of their work to support our campaign. This is a unique opportunity to purchase a work from these emerging photographers who are gaining attention both in Europe and in their respective home countries of New Zealand and Australia. Either piece would make a worthy contribution to an existing collection or make a great initial purchase for anyone looking at collecting photography. 

Melbourne based artist, Kate Robertson, who we will be representing this year at Photo London has also donated the above piece to the campaign. Circle Work 12 (2013) is a photogram, that being an image produced through the photographic process without the use of a camera, produced by hand by the artist in the darkroom. This is a unique silver gelatin print, faithful to the chemistry and history of photography, however leaving no negative or reproduction available. 


First featured in our Frühlings Salon and later in group exhibition Transcendental, Michael Corridore has generously donated the above piece in support of our plans.Untitled 13 (2006) is from the widely celebrated Angry Black Snake, published in Hijacked 2 Australia | Germany, among other significant publications both online and off, this successful body of work also won the 2008 Aperture Portfolio Prize. 
Edition 4 of 13 is produced exclusively at 31,53 x 21cm for the Indiegogo Campaign.

<h2>OUR STORY:</h2> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>The Community Acting Company is a group of nine collaborators dedicated to producing vibrant, truthful, and imaginative works for theatre and film, utilizing the Meisner Technique, as learned at The William Esper Studio.</span></p>
<p>We believe life must be experienced, which is why creating and observing art with the Meisner Technique is so crucial in today’s society. The Technique allows us to connect directly to the core of humanity through the exploration of new cultures and philosophies. Within that connection, we change our views and behavior in life. We become free, curious, and more engaged. It not only changes us but everyone we touch.</p>
<p>For a company like this to succeed, we had to have an environment where we could feel free to invent, play, and make mistakes which is why we created The Community. It is a service organization with almost 300 members that hosts a variety of performance and social opportunities for actors and artists to collaborate and connect with one another, completely free of charge.</p>
<p>The Community empowers and emboldens artists to live happy, courageous, and productive lives.  We firmly believe, it is important to cultivate and encourage an artist’s success and not perpetuate the idea of the “artist’s plight.”  The Community is a support system for creatives to engage and collaborate with one another to produce a higher quality of work.</p>
<p>We are committed to producing works of art that reflect and serve this mission and these values to the public and <i>we have already booked the venue for our first show at The Producer's Club right off of Times Square in NYC!!! We open April 2015. </i></p>To read more about our mission and the impact your contribution will make, please scroll down!<br/>

   Risks & Challenges Hi friends- Jac here, 
If there is anything I have learned over the last 8 months, it's that if the unexpected can happen, it will. As with any new company, we are aware of the many risks and challenges that will inevitably come our way. 
However, The Community Acting Company is different from many others because we began purely as a service organization for our fellows. That has gives us the amazing resource of a support system like no other: a network of nearly 300 artists who provide an awe inspiring range of connections, expertise and skills. 
I believe the culture of service and support that we cultivate makes us uniquely situated to handle any situation that arises. With so many people working on a solution, whenever a problem does arise, I know we will be able to overcome anything that seems to stand in our way.
Words simply aren't enough to express the gratitude we feel for helping us make a dream into reality. We are all so incredibly grateful for your support.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Anne Woodman. I started making jewelry about 5 years ago and have been slowly but surely building a business out of it. Unfortunately, when I decided to turn this craft into a money making business, I was starting with zero capital. So over the years, I've had to: make a sale - get business cards made, make a sale - get look books printed, make a sale - get some displays, (and the forever) make a sale - get more jewelry supplies to make more stuff! I'm really trying to get out there now, and everything costs money! I just spent every last penny on a trade show in Paris (Bonjour! I'm here now) and I realized that the deadline to apply for the Renegade craft fair is Friday at midnight. I've never done the Renegade and I think I would do really well there. I know I would make  lot of sales, meet some great people, grow the business further. So I went to apply online and they want $400 up front! Imagine my dismay, I am spent, literally.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of doing this craft fair without going into debt will mean that I can use the money that is made from this fair to create a ""Fair/Show fund"" that will be used to attend more and more fairs/shows, grow the fund, grow the business (already going global, people) and you can say that you knew me when and not only that, but you had a part in the success!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $400 by midnight Friday March 4th. Then I need $100 to buy a new table to be used at craft fairs and shows (mine recently gave up after 4 years of abuse), and the remaining money will go into the Fair/Show Fund. If I don't reach my goal in such a short time period, or, if Renegade doesn't accept me, the money will start the afore mentioned Fair/Show Fund. If you donate anything, you will be kept updated via email as to which fairs the money is going to. I already have a list of fairs and shows that I would love to participate in this spring and summer and every single one costs something. Also, check out the amazing perks that I am offering!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you know other artisans/crafters that would like to do these kinds of fairs, many times, they will allow you to share space. I prefer not to share with other jewelry designers but handbags, hats, scarves, shoes, flowers, I'm open to pretty much anything else. It's always more fun to do these things with company. </p>
<p>Also, if you know of ant fabulous venues that I should apply for, I am always interested in suggestions! I will travel!</p>

Poetry, art and art films are like bread to the hungry.  They give us the hope and courage to rise to our greatest deeds and act as conscience when we do not rise. We are not only creating a film but a gathering point for conversations that create community to last longer than any art.<br/>
Help us produce <em>“To the Diggers”</em>, the second in a collection of four short art films to be shown in a new kind of exhibition. Based upon a poem Mark Turner wrote in 2006, <em>“To the Diggers”</em> asks whether the sights and sounds of public relations will survive to be dug up by future archeologists.  This is Film 2 of the <strong>FilmGalleryColxn</strong>, four short films merging tangible artwork with digital treatment, spoken word with music and sound effects, all in a motion graphics presentation which inspires you to talk about the philosophical and spiritual aspects of life.<br/>
When the collection of films is completed the premiere of the films will be a pilot event to test the new exhibition idea, the <strong>“film-gallery-café”</strong>.  The projected time of the pilot event is Spring, 2011.  The test event will teach us about opening a permanent venue where art films and the artwork used to make them stimulate significant conversations encouraging people on their journeys toward God.  Until then each finished film will help build the support base which will make the premiere a big success and launch development of the <strong>“film-gallery-café”</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Background on the Artists:</strong><br/>
For some 40 years we, <strong>Mark &amp; Donna Turner</strong>, have inspired people on five continents through our films, theater and teaching.  We founded and still direct <strong>Horizon Gate Productions</strong>, a 30 year old non-profit arts organization (501c)3).  Our career has been dependent upon donations from supporters and in this way we successfully raised a family amid all our art projects and travels.  Lately the economy has taken its toll on donors’ ability to give.  We must broaden our community to include <strong>you and your friends.  Please join in helping spread the word about this campaign</strong> so we can accomplish the next step in our mission to inspire people.</p>
<p><strong>Funds Needed:</strong><br/>
The first 10 people to contribute $10 or more will be listed in the credits of the film as “First Funders”.<br/>
You can help make this art film, <em>“To the Diggers”</em>, by sponsoring the poem, sound effects, music, voice, drawings, motion graphics, or release party. Your contributions will help cover our living expenses for about two months, upgrade computers, purchase art materials and purchase an external hard drive to store all the new digital files.<br/>
All donations are tax deductible and will be administered through Horizon Gate Productions, a 501c)3, non-profit organization.

You can now purchase this book online. Visit my Etsy page for details!You can also get them for free if you're apart of a non-profit organization. Please email minnie@minniephan.com.Thanks!First: I started this campaign will little expectations, but I was completely blown away by the generosity of friends and people around the world. Thank you so much for helping make this project a reality!Second: On November 22nd, 2013 I was awarded a grant of $500 from the California College of the Arts towards this project. I am so happy to announce that once I reach $2,100 here on Indiegogo, my campaign will be complete and all proceeds after printing and shipping costs will be donated to Direct Relief towards helping Typhoon Haiyan victims.Third: Thank you everyone for the incredible support!The book debuted on December 12th and everyone was so thrilled and happy. It was awesome!----------------------------------The painting you see above this text is of my parents at a refugee camp in Hong Kong.23 years ago, my parents became known as 'boat people' and escaped Vietnam in hopes of a brighter future. They were at sea for roughly 30 days before reaching China and then were granted access to America three years later.My name is Minnie Phan and I was born in the San Francisco Bay Area. I grew up in a household where the past was never spoken of, and my desire for a punk rock life style left my relationship with my parents distant and torn. I rebelled against the culture my parents had given me.In the summer of 2013, I won a scholarship to visit
Vietnam for the first time in 15 years. What came from this experience was a new understanding of my parents and the stories they left on the shores of Vietnam. When I returned to America, I illustrated this trip as my senior Illustration thesis at the California College of the Arts. The moment I arrived to Saigon, I was labeled “Việt
Kiều”, a term used by
Vietnamese citizens to refer to Vietnamese people living in other countries. In the United States, I did not feel like an American, and yet in Vietnam, I
was not even a true Vietnamese. But this didn't hold me back. My trip transformed into a
 journey
about my cultural identity and the importance of family. I went 
21 years of my life disliking my own skin. But after this
journey, I was changed. (This is me with my extended family in Hue, Vietnam)But I need help funding the printing of this book
It is thanks to my parents that I am living in the United States and
 am 
able to obtain a college degree. However, my family has always struggled financially, and I've been funding my own 
education from the very beginning. I've written countless scholarship essays, and every summer I work at least 2 jobs to pay my tuition. This book is very special to me.. but also
 very costly. I want to surprise my parents and say thank you, but I do 
not have the heart to burden them with financial need. This project has been a secret for the last 4 months, and I would like to surprise them at my thesis reception.I have roughly a week to get funding for this project
Out of shyness, I was afraid to try an Indiegogo campaign. But I love my parents and my family so much.. I told myself I had to at least try. So in order to print my books on time, I will need to raise the funds within a week. Any amount helps. Even a forward via e-mail is appreciated. My ultimate goal is to also print this book in Vietnamese, so that I can reach my extended family as well.Even if you can't contribute, please get the word out!

Shanta Ambady and I am an artist based out of Detroit, Michigan.
After a few years exploring different avenues of creation (from burlesque,
sideshow and fire performing, to the culinary arts, to painting, and anything
else I could get myself into), I've found that ultimately I'd like to focus my
attention on ceramics and illustration. Until I can find a way to get back into
school, I've been seeking alternative ways of education and now I have a HUGE
opportunity to work alongside two very influential artists – Ayumi Horie and
Andy Brayman -  at a renowned ceramic
arts foundation! Of course, this winter has been a rough one for all of us
(especially in Detroit), so a pothole-induced flat tire here, some soaring
heating bills there, a few doctors visits…and poof! There went the money I was
saving to take this class. </span><br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
<br/>
However, I’m not giving up just yet! I believe in the power of community. Just
as I have donated to causes and charities whenever I could afford to, I am now
asking for help to reach my own goals. This workshop is focused on learning diverse
techniques of making water-slide decals for firing onto ceramic ware -
including silk-screening, laser printing and digital printing. They will also
go over different methods of illustration in Photoshop and Illustrator, which
would be incredibly beneficial to me. I can’t express how excited I would be to
learn more ways to combine my two favorite mediums and open up more
possibilities for my work (not to mention, I would be pretty geeked to meet these two
cutting edge artists!) <br/><br/>
The Archie Bray Foundation itself is a nonprofit organization dedicated to
emerging and established ceramic artists and also listed on the National
Register of Historic Places. This could potentially be another huge stepping
stone in my career, and a much needed boost of inspiration. Any small amount
will get me closer and would be infinitely appreciated. </span></p>

modest estimate is about $2,200 for the trip. This covers tuition for the class
($795), my housing for two weeks which will thankfully include a shuttle bus to

specific dates, I don’t have a lot of flexibility in finding cheaper flights or

</div>","MOTIF
À notre plus grande surprise, nous, les 15 finissants de l'École de danse contemporaine de Montréal sommes invités à reprendre la pièce ""Avant les gens mouraient"", crée par le collectif (La) Horde dans le cadre du Festival Les Denses Journées de la Danse 2015, à Paris les 8 et 9 mai.

VOTRE SOUTIEN 
Nous sollicitons votre aide afin d'obtenir une valeur ajoutée sur notre déplacement vers la ville lumière. Ce projet nous tient tous à cœur et notre mobilisation à le réaliser en est la preuve. Le montant de fonds amassés sera un appui non négligeable même si nous ne parvenons pas à atteindre notre objectif. 

L'IMPACT DU PROJET
C'est un magnifique projet professionnel pré-diplôme qui aura pour but de nous placer dans la plus pure réalité du métier et les conditions de travail d'un interprète professionnel. C'est de plus une première expérience internationale. 
En réalisant ce projet nous allons faire face à plusieurs éléments techniques qui compose la vie d'artiste et lui confère tout son épanouissement. Nous sommes des bourgeons sur le point d'éclore. 
Une très belle opportunité pour conforter nos choix de carrière future.

It really is a once in a lifetime opportunity. When applying for this residency I was hoping to receive the ""one"" full fellowship offered, however that was not meant to be. I am grateful to have been invited to attend and I have been offered a partial fellowship (out of hundreds of applicants). Yippie! Go me!! I just need a little help.

</div>PETT Plant is a true work of art not only inspired by nature, but 
created directly from the natural world! There are no computers, 3D 
printers or anything digital involved in the rendering of the flowers. The Plants
 come directly from nature, to art studio to you via our own proprietary
 Direct-Life-Molding process. Early PETT Plant supporters will be able 
to choose from one of four variations of different species for their 
PETT and receive a free lifecast succulent ring as well. (We will contact you by email to determine which species and which ring you prefer after you make your contribution.)<br/><br/>PETT Plant is not a product from a factory, it is a hand made and produced sculpture that fuses art, science and technology to create a truly interactive experience that is as beautiful as it is mesmerizing!<br/><br/>PETT Plant comes with a custom designed Android app and several pre-programmed light animations you can choose from with your smart phone. In addition, you can adjust the speed at which any animation plays, or simply press the hold button to freeze the sculpture wherever you want. <br/><br/>PETT Plant's illuminated interactive stems are movable and will stay in whatever position you pose them in. It will fit most anywhere, anyhow and with anything and loves the company of living plants. And with the addition of our custom magnetic mounting bracket, it can hang from the ceiling as a chandelier as well.<br/><br/>PETT Plant has a sound responsive mode where the color of each stem modulates like a rainbow graphic equalizer!<br/><br/>PETT Plant also comes pre-programmed with several brainwave entrainment sequences you can use together with any of the light animations. (Brainwave entrainment is the phenomena by which brainwaves synchronize with light and sound waves under the right conditions. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwave_entrainment)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwave_entrainment)</a> In entrainment mode, PETT Plant will pulsate at specific frequencies to help move you into brainwave states conducive to inducing sleep, meditation or increasing alertness. And unlike with entrainment goggles, PETT Plant will allow two or even a whole group of people to synchronize their brain waves together in tandem! WARNING: If you are epileptic or in any other way prone to seizures, entrainment is not for you, as it has been shown that blinking lights can induce seizures in those that are predisposed to having them.<br/><br/>PETT Plant is USB powered. Plug it into any phone charger, your computer, a portable power bank or one of our Powerslugs if you would like to take it somewhere out into the world where the electrons are beyond your control.<br/><br/><p>PETT Plant's brain is the 
Teensy 3.1, an ARM-based, Arduino-compatible microcontroller module. It 
is programmable with the open source Arduino IDE. Brainwave entrainment 
not your thing? Reprogram it to do whatever you want!</p><p><br/></p><b>ABOUT BIOTRONESIS </b><br/>BioTronEsis is a collective of hyper creative, 
tech smart artists and programmers collaborating to create uniquely 
transformative art experiences that fuse nature, art, science and 
technology. Our namesake, the 2014 Burning Man piece BioTronEsis, is a 
giant electroluminescent biopod we created that employs brain wave 
entrainment and binaural beats to help induce group trance experiences. 
It was from the overwhelming response, appreciation and love we 
received with our Biotron in the desert last year, that we now feel 
obliged to share this with the world at large! The PETT Plant is 
the culmination of a 6 month effort to do just that!<br/><br/>This 
campaign will help us to fund that process the rest of the way by 
providing us with the necessary capitol to design and make custom 
printed circuit boards, finish and test the app, as well as supply all 
the materials and other electronics to make our first limited edition 
production run in time for the holiday season.<br/><br/>For your 
pledge of support, we promise you all the fun, beauty, entertainment 
and trance that we have looking at and experiencing our own creations. 
And we guarantee that your one of a kind uniquely original plants and slugs will 
be engaging you and your friends and family for many years to come. <br/><br/>It
 is our hope that by running a successful campaign, the PETT Plant will 
end up being the first in a long series of PETT creatures, PETT Aliens,

initial molds for getting the production line going are complete and 
ready to go! We manufacture the parts ourselves and source most of the 
materials and electronics in the US, so many of the risks normally 
associated with overseas factories and sourcing materials abroad are not
 so much of a concern for our campaign. As well, the Android version of 
our APP is most of the way there. Challenges are concerned with the lack
 of an iOS version in this first production run. It will be our first 
priority to address this concern with an iOS development benchmark goal 
if there is sufficient demand from people. We are counting on 
support from the Indiegogo community to let us know. <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442191392/apfmak2q7vfhv9uupjvt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p></div>","PETT Plant is a true work of art not only inspired by nature, but

 is our hope that by running a successful campaign, the PETT Plant will 
end up being the first in a long series of PETT creatures, PETT Aliens, 
PETT brains, PETT.......................and that world domination will soon be in sight!Other Ways You Can Help................If growing an illumintated bioelectric garden
 is prohibited in your town or area and you just can 't risk the fine, 
please spread the word about our art with your friends and family in person
 and on social media (using the Indiegogo share tools).  Please  convey to 
them personally just how you think they might benefit from the 
transcendental effects of a PETT Plant in their home or office!PETT OPTIONS:
PETT Plant comes with multiple options for the plant species that adorn the end of each stem. (The standard version PETT Plant comes with 6 long repositionable stems and 6 short non repositionable stems.) Since these are limited edition sculptures, not more than 25 will ever be made of any one particular species. As of the time of this launch, available choices are:PETT Plant comes with two different options for the base pod. PETT plant is also available as a Delux version. All PETT Plants come with a 110V wall socket adapter for those times when you don't have a computer, phonecharger or Powerslug to plug into. As well, each PETT Plant shipped will include 1 free lifecast succulent ring of your choice from the options below. PETT ACCESSORIES: OUR PROCESSSUPER PERKSOUR TEAMErick Dunn - Light and Sound Sculptor As an artist, I have been molding and casting living things and incorporating them into sculpture for the last 20 years. Now immersed in the transformative art movement, I have been creating light and sound art that incorporates brain wave entrainment, biofeedback and and various other transformative technologies to listen to and translate biometric data generated by humans into light animations and soundscapes.John Van Strien - Conjurer of the InconceivableJohn has been exploring and creating most of his life, and loves to express his creativity in many ways. Whether it's writing elegant software to create mesmerizing color patterns, banging on hot steel, melting glass in a kiln, or free form dancing. With a background in electronics and software development, he enjoys blending the realms of art and technology, mixing simple low tech materials with the latest in high tech wizardry, to create interactive and immersive experiences for people that push the boundaries of the conceivable. Claudia Meglin - Creativity HarvesterClaudia is a filmmaker, artist, creative leader and innovator. Her calling in life is to aid transformative ideas and generative entrepreneurship world wide by helping people to acquire the creative skills necessary to bring together art, technology and business to consciously design a sustainable and happy future for our world. In the last two decades she has guided film productions and software companies through the digital revolution by instituting cutting edge technologies alongside her principals of compassion for creating happy and productive teams.Howard Tsu - Pattern makerI am a metaphorical bridge between 
production and design, software and hardware, as well as a future 
architect. My passion has been toward the actualization of nuanced 
realities, with the PETT being another form in which the flora can take 
form. I aim to be a part of the creation of a future where the ebb and 
flow of form, energy, and creativity can take place with minimal 
resistance and maximum support.Dan Freeman - Neuro NerdoDan likes brains almost as much as zombies, but his preference is to study them as opposed to eating them. He only comes out at night.SPECIAL THANKS Mitch Altman- Co-founder of Noisebridge hacker spaceMitch is a life long meditater and entrainment guru as well as the inventor of the TV B-Gone and maker of the brain machine entrainment goggles. Mitch travels the world gifting his genius to fellow hackers/makers and his entrainment code is the source for our meditation sequence and the inspiration for the BioTron.Natasha Juliana  - owner and founder workpetalumaRISKS AND CHALLENGES:As of the beginning of this campaign, our working prototype and the 
initial molds for getting the production line going are complete and 
ready to go! We manufacture the parts ourselves and source most of the 
materials and electronics in the US, so many of the risks normally 
associated with overseas factories and sourcing materials abroad are not
 so much of a concern for our campaign. As well, the Android version of 
our APP is most of the way there. Challenges are concerned with the lack
 of an iOS version in this first production run. It will be our first 
priority to address this concern with an iOS development benchmark goal 
if there is sufficient demand from people. We are counting on 
support from the Indiegogo community to let us know.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

cubría todo. Conocí los <b>5 Ritmos</b> en 2009, y me sentí “de vuelta en casa”. Por
fin algo que lo ponía todo en movimiento, a la vez, y encima mediante la danza
libre. ¡Esto era!</p>Llevo 7 años trabajando y profundizando en esta práctica. Desde el primer momento tuve claro que quería ser profesor en 5 Ritmos, y ahora tengo la oportunidad de dar un primer paso más profundo en esta dirección: realizar una formación llamada ""<b></b><a href=""http://www.5rhythms.com/es/5rhythms-sweat-spaceholder-program/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">5Rhythms Sweat SpaceHolder</a><b></b>"" que me permitirá ofrecer esta práctica en mi comunidad, como paso previo a convertirme en profesor certificado y llevarlo a todo el mundo.<p>Puedes conocer más sobre los 5 Ritmos y su creadora, <b>Gabrielle Roth</b>, en su <a href=""http://www.5rhythms.com/es/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">web oficial.</a></p>

<h3>Impacto / Impact</h3> <p>El viaje para ser profesor en 5 Ritmos es largo. Implica atender talleres por todo el mundo. No es algo que consigas en un año, o dos.  Yo llevo siete años bailando. Pero no es sólo el tiempo y la inversión económica. Este camino es un camino de transformación personal, y el trabajo no está sólo en los talleres, sino en tu día a día, que es donde esta práctica muestra todo su poder transformativo y su inspiración creativa.</p>
<p>Los 5 Ritmos son una práctica para cualquiera que quiera iniciar su viaje personal. Están conectados con lo más auténtico de cada persona y buscan una y otra vez sacar eso fuera y expresarlo, vivirlo. Te conectan con la vida, con los demás y contigo mismo. Todo eso a través de la danza y el movimiento... pero mucho más allá. Mi compromiso con esta práctica es llevarla a tantas personas como sea posible.</p>
<p></p>
<p><i>To be a certified 5 Rhyhtms teacher is a long way. It
is not something you get in one or two years. Attending workshops for over the
world. It’s not only time and money inversion; this is a journey of personal
transformation, and the work is not only at workshops. It’s in daily life where
this practice shows all its transformative power and creative inspiration.</i></p>
<p><i>5 Rhythms are a practice for personal growing journey.
They are connected with the more authentic in every person and they express it
in the world. They connect you with life, others and yourself, trough dance and
movement. My commitment with this practice is bring it to as much people as
possible.</i></p>

¡Hola! / Hi! 
Mi nombre es Oscar Iborra. Vivo en Granada (España). Soy psicólogo, trabajo
con grupos y a nivel individual promoviendo el crecimiento personal y
colectivo. También realizo investigación en la Universidad de Granada en áreas
como consciencia, embodiment, sinestesia e ideaestesia y parapsicología.

He transitado varias vías, prácticas y técnicas – con mayor o menor
profundidad: meditación, PNL, trabajo corporal, transpersonal… Pero para mí, ninguna lo
cubría todo. Conocí los 5 Ritmos en 2009, y me sentí “de vuelta en casa”. Por
fin algo que lo ponía todo en movimiento, a la vez, y encima mediante la danza
libre. ¡Esto era!Llevo 7 años trabajando y profundizando en esta práctica. Desde el primer momento tuve claro que quería ser profesor en 5 Ritmos, y ahora tengo la oportunidad de dar un primer paso más profundo en esta dirección: realizar una formación llamada ""5Rhythms Sweat SpaceHolder"" que me permitirá ofrecer esta práctica en mi comunidad, como paso previo a convertirme en profesor certificado y llevarlo a todo el mundo.Puedes conocer más sobre los 5 Ritmos y su creadora, Gabrielle Roth, en su web oficial.
¿Y ahora? Ahora necesito tu ayuda para que me ayudes a cubrir parte de los gastos de todo esto. Llegar a ser profesor de 5 Ritmos es un viaje largo... y no sólo en kilómetros!
Mi name is Oscar Iborra. I live in Granada (Spain) I'm psychologist, working on personal growth with individuals and groups. I'm also a researcher at Granada University; my fields are consciousness, embodiment, synesthesia and parapsychology. I’ve walked by several paths, practices and techniques, greater or
lesser depth, as meditation, NLP, body work, transpersonal psychology… I meet 5Rhythms in 2009, and I
just find myself “at home”. 5Rhythms is a dynamic movement practice developed by Gabrielle Roth. I have been actively dancing
5Rhythms for the last 7 years and am taking it to the next level by joining the 5Rhythms Sweat SpaceHolder Program, which is the first step towards becoming a
certified teacher. 

And now I need YOU to help me cover part of the expenses for this goal within the next month!

    Qué necesito y qué puedo ofrecerte / What I need and what I can give you Estos son los gastos que tengo que afrontar.

Equipo técnico (programa DJ para ordenador y tarjeta de sonido): 200€

To provide you with more information, these are my
expenses:
- SpaceHolder Training: 1400€
Euro

What I can give you in return is this practice itself. The 5 Rhythms. First here in my community (Granada) and then, over the world, as certified teacher in the future. But this is the first step!

(ATTENTION: If you don't want/can't donate using PayPal, please email me: oscariborra@gmail.com. We can find another way)

   
Impacto / Impact El viaje para ser profesor en 5 Ritmos es largo. Implica atender talleres por todo el mundo. No es algo que consigas en un año, o dos.  Yo llevo siete años bailando. Pero no es sólo el tiempo y la inversión económica. Este camino es un camino de transformación personal, y el trabajo no está sólo en los talleres, sino en tu día a día, que es donde esta práctica muestra todo su poder transformativo y su inspiración creativa.
Los 5 Ritmos son una práctica para cualquiera que quiera iniciar su viaje personal. Están conectados con lo más auténtico de cada persona y buscan una y otra vez sacar eso fuera y expresarlo, vivirlo. Te conectan con la vida, con los demás y contigo mismo. Todo eso a través de la danza y el movimiento... pero mucho más allá. Mi compromiso con esta práctica es llevarla a tantas personas como sea posible.

To be a certified 5 Rhyhtms teacher is a long way. It
is not something you get in one or two years. Attending workshops for over the
world. It’s not only time and money inversion; this is a journey of personal
transformation, and the work is not only at workshops. It’s in daily life where
this practice shows all its transformative power and creative inspiration.
5 Rhythms are a practice for personal growing journey.
They are connected with the more authentic in every person and they express it
in the world. They connect you with life, others and yourself, trough dance and
movement. My commitment with this practice is bring it to as much people as
possible.

Riesgos y desafíos / Risks and challenges  ¿Hay mayor riesgo o desafío que la transformación personal? 
En mi caso, un gran riesgo es el económico. Tengo dos hijos. Este proyecto, al igual que los siete años que llevo en esto, suponen un desequilibrio económico y familiar. Por suerte tengo el apoyo de mi familia. Suena bien la idea de viajar a Sausalito, Londres, Berlín, Barcelona, Madrid... sitios a los que he ido siguiendo los 5 Ritmos. Pero también es difícil hacerlo con dos hijos en casa y pensando en si no te habrás pasado con los gastos.
Esta formación me permitirá además, mediante las sesiones que facilite, conseguir un apoyo económico que utilizaré a su vez para continuar en el viaje para ser profesor de 5 Ritmos.

Is there any greater risk or challenge than personal transformation?
For me, a great risk is economic. I have two sons. 5 Rhythms and the longing for become a teacher, represent an economic and family imbalance. Luckily I have the support of my family. It sounds good idea to travel to Sausalito, London, Berlin, Barcelona, Madrid ... places that I have visited following 5 Rhythms. But it is also difficult with two children at home and thinking about if you've passed the bill.
This training will also allow me, by facilitating Sweats, getting financial support that I will use in turn to continue on the journey to become a 5 Rhythms teacher.

<p> This fundraiser is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of our second season must be made payable to Fractured Atlas only and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<h2>Why Help Us?</h2>
<p>We see many different theater companies, or dance companies, or performance art companies in this city, but never have we seen one that encompasses all of them. This company is composed of branches: a theater branch, a dance branch, a new works branch, a musical theater branch, a children's theater branch, and a multimedia branch. When you audition for this company and are invited in, you are a member of all branches. You may do a dance show one year, but then have the opportunity to be a part of a play the next.</p>
<p>    We’ve created a strictly non-union company where all artists come together. A company where a singer, an actor, a designer, a director, and a painter, could work together on a dance piece. By creating a structure where a company has many branches, it allows artists to either expand and grow on what they already love in a safe and nurturing environment OR try something new! Whether it be on your own, or with a mentor in another branch.</p>
<p>It is so important that we support the future of our industry, and that's exactly what this company is geared towards. </p>
<p>The work we are doing is important. It's necessary. It's coming from the voices of tomorrow. The artists of tomorrow. The leaders of tomorrow. The work is honest, it's passionate, it's innovative. We strive to create work that leaves people thinking--work that causes people to reflect on the state of our country and our world.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Where Will This Money Go?</h2>
<p>If we reach our goal of $35,000, we will be able to:</p>
<p>- Put up 4 full Productions: a musical, a play, a dance show, and an original work</p>
<p>- Create a year of Children's Theatre in which we will go into schools throughout New York, performing different works by Aesop and educating children aged 9-11 in the concept of literary devices.</p>
<p>- film our first web series! An original 30 minute per episode, 10 episode season!</p>
<p>- pay our actors, directors, and designers for all productions</p>
<p>- pay our film crew for what is sure to be A LOT of time and energy</p>
<p>- afford decent spaces, get the proper insurance, pay for rights and licensing for all productions,</p>
<p>- create capital for future seasons!</p>
<p>If we aren't able to reach our goal, the money raised will go towards the first shows in our season, and we will have to look at other methods of fundraising to cover the shortfall. We need to be able to offer these artists all the support and tools that they deserve!</p>
<p>In our first season of 3 shows we were able to establish an average of over 100 patrons a production with over $1600 in ticket revenue a production. With more work consistently being made and the community growing, we are confident that these numbers will continue to grow.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>We Won't Give Up!</h2>
<p>Last year, we weren't able to raise the necessary funds and it definitely created many obstacles. Our Producing Artistic Director, Alex Nicholson, definitely had moments where he felt discouraged, where he questioned why he started this, where he considered giving up. But when he looked at all the artists that were counting on him, they were inspired by the work that was being put up. They were excited to be a part of a community that helped them grow instead of knocking them down. It became apparent how necessary it was to keep the work alive, so he worked extra shifts and searched high and low for every penny he could find, and he made it happen. Its one of the great qualities of this company: our members take the work seriously. The work is important and necessary.</p>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute, we understand. But you can definitely still share and spread the word! If we can find 3500 people who can give us 10 dollars, we will reach our goal. 3500 may seem like a lot of people, but it all comes down to how well we can get this word out there! Help us reach this goal in whatever way you can, and we promise you will see the result of your fiscal or social contribution!</p>

<p>Le 5.5 designstudio, déjà multi récompensé, manie l’art du second degré avec générosité.Auteur d’un design accessible, le studio se plait à dérider des pièces de luxe comme des objets de consommation courante pour redessiner un quotidien joyeux, pratique où ses (ré)inventions percutantes s’inscrivent comme des évidences.</p>

<p>Objet culte et générationnel, le Picardie de Duralex était un terrain d’expérimentations idéal pour les jeunes trentenaires du studio.</p>

<p>Prédicateur d’âges improbables et distributeur de gages à la cantine, le petit numéro sous le verre a fait coulé beaucoup d’encre. Numéro de série ? Simplement là pour faire parler petits et grands ? L’origine des « âges » dissimulés sous le verre reste un mystère.</p>

<p>Une chose est certaine, sa recette de fabrication lui confère une résistance sans pareille, qui lui vaut désormais une (très) solide réputation dans le monde entier. La preuve en est que le verre a quasiment l’âge de son « créateur » qui a fêté l’an dernier ses 70 printemps et est toujours fabriqué dans son usine d’origine près d’Orléans. </p>
<p>S'offrir un Duralex c'est s'offrir un objet ludique, esthétique et utile. C'est s'entourer d'objets uniques racontant une histoire !</p>

<p>Pour rendre le design accessible, nous devons co-financer les moules nécessaires à la production des accessoires Duralex sans que cela se répercute sur le prix final des produits. </p>
<p>Ces moules à injection en métal représentent un investissement initial très important.</p>
<p>Le crowdfunding s’est donc imposé à nous comme une évidence car il permet d'absorber une partie de cet investissement et de maintenir ainsi accessible le prix final des produits.</p>
<p>Pendant toute la campagne, pré-commandez vos Duralex préférés à des prix encore plus exclusifs. Alors, n'attendez plus ! Retombez en enfance avec ces objets décalés et offrez-vous un objet de créateur pour pimenter votre quotidien !</p>

<p><strong>Le montant nécessaire au co-financement des moules est de 8000 euros.</strong></p>
<p>Si nous dépassons cet objectif et atteignons 15 000 euros, cela nous permettra de financer 1000 exemplaires supplémentaires à destination des boutiques. Pour vous remercier de votre soutien, <strong>nous offrirons à tous les paniers supérieurs à 40 euros 6 verres Duralex 9cl. </strong></p>
<p>Si nous atteignons 20 000 euros, cela nous permettra de lancer dans un second temps, un troisième accessoires Duralex.<strong> Nous offrirons alors à tous les paniers supérieurs à 70 euros le livre <i>Repas de Famille</i>, aux éditions Phaidon.</strong></p>

<p>The 5.5 designstudio, already a winner of many awards, has a good-natured way of handling irony and humour. Producing affordable design, the studio delights in adding a lighter touch to luxury items as well as everyday consumer goods in order to redesign a cheerful, practical daily life in which its punchy (re)inventions self-evidently belong.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477055565/uyav2zmm2n5tyuzf9v7f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A cult and generational object, the Duralex Picardie was an ideal area of experiment for the studio’s young thirty-somethings.</p>

<p>A declaimer of improbable ages and canteen token dispenser, a great deal of ink has flowed because of the small number under the glass. A serial number? There simply to get young and old talking? The origin of the “ages” hidden under the glass remains a mystery.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477055624/rott8rvwtv8xrlvc7dsx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>One thing is certain - its manufacturing formula gives it unparalleled strength, which has now earned it a (very) solid reputation throughout the world. The proof is that the glass is almost the same age as its “creator” which celebrated its 70th birthday last year and is still made at its original factory near Orléans. </p>

<p>Pour réaliser cet objectif, nous avons minutieusement planifié le calendrier de production et de livraison avec nos fournisseurs et partenaires.</p>
</div>
<p>Nous avons maintenant trois ans d'expérience (!) en conception et fabrication de produits de design contemporain.

<p>Il sera par ailleurs probablement nécessaire d’effectuer quelques ajustements mineurs au produit final.

Tous les ajustements seront décidés dans votre intérêt, celui du consommateur. Nous vous informerons précisément de l’évolution des produits et des raisons des ajustements effectués.</p>
<p>En ce qui concerne les livraisons, l'équipe Designerbox-IPC épaulée de son « efficace » partenaire logistique justifient d’une grande expérience dans la préparation et l'exécution de commandes dans le monde entier, ceci pour permettre de vous envoyer vos contributions dans les temps :)</p>
<p>Malgré une planification minutieuse, un accident en fabrication ou lors de l’expédition peut bien sûr toujours survenir. Ce que nous pouvons vous promettre à 100% est de vous tenir au courant à chaque étape du processus de production en étant totalement transparents sur son avancement !</p>

Vous rencontrez des difficultés pour valider votre panier ? On vous guide pas à pas, juste là !

 

Pour célébrer le 70ème anniversaire de Duralex, les talentueux designers du 5.5 designstudio ont dessiné une série d’accessoires (ré) créatifs et utiles pour habiller le fameux verre Picardie, ex-star des cantines scolaires !Notre première collection de Duralex (composée de 4 produits) a vu le jour sur le salon Maison & Objet en Septembre 2016. L'incroyable accueil que vous lui avez réservé nous a donné des ailes !Vous avez eu envie de voir plus d'objets dans cette collection, nous vous avons écouté et souhaitons aujourd'hui produire deux nouveaux objets que vous avez choisis (Vous avez voté en masse sur tous les réseaux !) :Un presse-agrumes pour faire le plein de vitamines !Un gobelet à emporter pour s'hydrater tout au long de la journée. 

 

Acheter un produit IPC, c'est se faire plaisir mais c'est aussi faire les choses bien !
Au sein de notre équipe jeune et motivée de supermen & women, nous donnons chaque jour le meilleur de nous-même pour vous proposer des produits en accord avec nos valeurs : 
Une vraie proposition design ! Pour faire un pied de nez aux objets de consommation de masse, trop souvent vus et revus. 
    Un savoir-faire fort, technologique et artisanal, pour assurer la qualité du produit. 
       Des matériaux nobles et recyclables pour une consommation plus responsable. 
     Des usines partenaires européennes et à taille humaine !
 

Le 5.5 designstudio, déjà multi récompensé, manie l’art du second degré avec générosité.Auteur d’un design accessible, le studio se plait à dérider des pièces de luxe comme des objets de consommation courante pour redessiner un quotidien joyeux, pratique où ses (ré)inventions percutantes s’inscrivent comme des évidences.

Objet culte et générationnel, le Picardie de Duralex était un terrain d’expérimentations idéal pour les jeunes trentenaires du studio.
 

Prédicateur d’âges improbables et distributeur de gages à la cantine, le petit numéro sous le verre a fait coulé beaucoup d’encre. Numéro de série ? Simplement là pour faire parler petits et grands ? L’origine des « âges » dissimulés sous le verre reste un mystère.

Une chose est certaine, sa recette de fabrication lui confère une résistance sans pareille, qui lui vaut désormais une (très) solide réputation dans le monde entier. La preuve en est que le verre a quasiment l’âge de son « créateur » qui a fêté l’an dernier ses 70 printemps et est toujours fabriqué dans son usine d’origine près d’Orléans. 
S'offrir un Duralex c'est s'offrir un objet ludique, esthétique et utile. C'est s'entourer d'objets uniques racontant une histoire !
 

Pour rendre le design accessible, nous devons co-financer les moules nécessaires à la production des accessoires Duralex sans que cela se répercute sur le prix final des produits. 
Ces moules à injection en métal représentent un investissement initial très important.
Le crowdfunding s’est donc imposé à nous comme une évidence car il permet d'absorber une partie de cet investissement et de maintenir ainsi accessible le prix final des produits.
Pendant toute la campagne, pré-commandez vos Duralex préférés à des prix encore plus exclusifs. Alors, n'attendez plus ! Retombez en enfance avec ces objets décalés et offrez-vous un objet de créateur pour pimenter votre quotidien !

Le montant nécessaire au co-financement des moules est de 8000 euros.
Si nous dépassons cet objectif et atteignons 15 000 euros, cela nous permettra de financer 1000 exemplaires supplémentaires à destination des boutiques. Pour vous remercier de votre soutien, nous offrirons à tous les paniers supérieurs à 40 euros 6 verres Duralex 9cl. 
Si nous atteignons 20 000 euros, cela nous permettra de lancer dans un second temps, un troisième accessoires Duralex. Nous offrirons alors à tous les paniers supérieurs à 70 euros le livre Repas de Famille, aux éditions Phaidon.




Pour prendre part à ce projet, pré-commandez dès maintenant vos Duralex préférés. 
Mais soutenir ce projet c'est aussi en parler autour de vous, le partager sur vos réseaux sociaux... Bref faire du bruit car n'oubliez pas, notre réussite dépend de vous :)

Half-way between a mass produced, standardised and throwaway design and the high quality creativity reserved for the privileged few, Iconic Product Collection (IPC), an optimistic publishing house, is introducing an innovative and welcome third way!


With its collection of unusual and affordable objects, IPC allows everyone to move away from the well-trodden paths of “seen it before” and the “commercial”. For the last 3 years we have been pushing the boundaries of decorative norms by offering historic objects to bring your interiors to life!

In celebration of the 70th anniversary of Duralex, the talented designers of the 5.5 designstudio have designed a series of creative, fun and useful accessories to go with the famous Picardie glass, the former star of school canteens!
Our first Duralex collection (consisting of 4 products) was first seen at the Maison & Objet’s September show. The incredible welcome that you gave it, gave us wings!
You wanted to see more objects in this collection; we listened to you and would now like to produce two new objects that you have chosen (chosen by vote):
A lemon press to keep you topped up with vitamins!

A portable cup to keep you hydrated all day long.


Pre-order your preview Duralex at a privileged price. 
And receive these products – in attractive packaging suitable for a gift or to treat yourself – at home in February to start the year on the right foot!

You can also – during the campaign – enjoy our first collection at a discount price!


The Christmas pack will be sent to you immediately after the end of the campaign! 

  

The 5.5 designstudio, already a winner of many awards, has a good-natured way of handling irony and humour. Producing affordable design, the studio delights in adding a lighter touch to luxury items as well as everyday consumer goods in order to redesign a cheerful, practical daily life in which its punchy (re)inventions self-evidently belong.

A cult and generational object, the Duralex Picardie was an ideal area of experiment for the studio’s young thirty-somethings.
 

A declaimer of improbable ages and canteen token dispenser, a great deal of ink has flowed because of the small number under the glass. A serial number? There simply to get young and old talking? The origin of the “ages” hidden under the glass remains a mystery.

One thing is certain - its manufacturing formula gives it unparalleled strength, which has now earned it a (very) solid reputation throughout the world. The proof is that the glass is almost the same age as its “creator” which celebrated its 70th birthday last year and is still made at its original factory near Orléans. 
Treating yourself to a Duralex is to give yourself something that is fun, attractive and useful. It is to surround yourself with unique objects that tell a story!
 

Purchasing an IPC product is not just giving yourself pleasure but doing things well too!
As members of our young and highly motivated team of supermen & women we give of our best every day in order to offer you products in line with our values: 
A genuine design proposal ! In order to cock a snook at mass produced goods, too often seen again and again. 
  Strong technical and craft knowledge and expertise to ensure a quality product. 
     High quality natural and recyclable materials for more responsible consumption. 
   European partner factories and on a human scale!
 

To make the design affordable, we have to finance the moulds needed for the production of Duralex accessories without impacting on the final price of the products. 
These metal injection moulds entail a very considerable initial investment.
So crowdfunding seemed obvious to us because it makes it possible to absorb part of this investment and thus maintain the final price of the products.


Throughout the campaign, pre-order your favourite Duralex products at even more exclusive prices. So don’t wait any longer! Relive your childhood with these offbeat objects and give yourself a designer object to spice up your life!
 

To participate in this project, pre-order your favourite Duralex any time from now on. 
But supporting this project also means spreading the word, sharing it on social networks... In short, getting people interested, because don’t forget, our success depends on you :)

if we reach more than 500 Shares for the campaign on Facebook, we will send all participants a small surprise to download!

<h3>Pecan Street Festival</h3>
<p>Greetings! My name is Monica Rodriguez. I am a freelance artist and avid smoothie drinker. I have been <strong>drawing</strong> since I was a wee thing and have also been <strong>painting</strong> for a substantial part of my life. Recently, I've dabbled in <strong>handmade jewelry</strong> and crafting accessories... all of which I'd love to display and sell to the public.</p>
<p>This campaign is here to raise money to purchase a booth for the <strong>Pecan Street Festival</strong> in Austin, TX. This large event is held along ATX's <em>famous</em> 6th Street, which is an important art and music hub.</p>

<li>It is the 2nd largest festival overall in Central Texas with an estimated attendance of over 200,000 attendees per show. Features include over 250 vendors, 5 stages, large sponsor displays, children's art workshops, a carnival, interactive sections, a petting zoo, and much more.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>It's the artist-at-large Membership Drive!</strong></p>
<p>artist-at-large is a tumbling social networking community, an arts and cultural travel magazine as well as a creative community for artists, writers, creatives, photographers, gallerists, museum nerds, and cultural travelers. Good for the artist and collector, trip researcher and armchair traveler, you will find a blend of community, conversation, creative portfolios and blogs, travel tales and information, photos of the day, and listings for exhibitions, open studios, workshops, and cultural events from around the world. The stories and information presented on the site are written in a way that are meant to be valuable over a long period of time, like an art or travel magazine that you keep by your desk and flip through when you need information, or just want to daydream, while the community is meant to engage and inspire.</p>
<p><strong>artist-at-large is supported by its community members!</strong></p>
<p>Right now this fundraising campaign will finance the current site upgrade with a membership drive. The upgrade will make it easier to access the site and participate via mobile devices as well.</p>

<p><strong>Hugh, Catrina, Freddy, Kevin </strong>and <strong>Omar </strong>are the founding members of Ada, a Bloomsbury-based collective of professional artists and architectural designers who work together to create spectacles of forward-looking architecture. Ada believe that by combining individuals who are the best in their field from different disciplines, the most aesthetic and intellectually stimulating results can be achieved. Since early 2012 the collective has been working closely with local organisations to produce interactive architectural pieces. Site-specific works have been installed at a number of major local events, including The A Boards at Bloomsbury Fete (2012) and the Icarus project at Bloomsbury Festival (2012).</p>
<p>We're working with composer <strong>Adam Donen.</strong> His last site specific performance piece, <strong>Jokasta: A Puppet Opera</strong>, sold out an 8 day run in London's Abney Park Cemetery. His last album, <strong>Vampires</strong>, a collaboration with Grammy-nominated Robert Harder, was released on the German Songs&amp;Whispers imprint, and has drawn extensive praise both live and on record across Europe. His next piece, <strong>Bernhard</strong>, a (second) collaboration with The Cure's Roger O'Donnell, will be performed in the UK and Germany by the world-renowned Wurtemmburg Chamber Orchestra of Heilbronn this October.</p>
<p><strong>Bedford Square</strong> is right next to Tottenham Court Road, and we’ve been approached to produce the headline piece of the Bloomsbury Summer Fete on the 14<sup>th</sup> of June at 1 in the afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>So what we want to do is...</strong></p>
<h3><strong>We want to fuse architecture with music and performance, and create the first ever dramatic piece (to our knowledge) with a STAGE as lead actor.</strong></h3>
<p>Europa is a musical and dramatic work inspired by the current Euro-crisis, seen through the prism of Brecht’s idea that a stage defines action more than the actors which perform upon it.</p>
<p>With your help, we're going to produce a bunch of apparently separate artworks, and have them 'subsume' the <strong>Europa </strong>piece while it happens. This may sound complex... stay with us here... </p>
<p><strong>We want to fill the square with interactive architecture </strong>– there will be see-saws, slides and tables all of which will be used by around 3000 people that will be drawn to the festival. They'll all be beautiful and functional, but also built very cunningly so that at lunchtime they can take part in the main performance of <strong>Europa</strong>.</p>
<h3><img alt=""The Europa Stage"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.adamdonen.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Europa-stage-2.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></h3>
<h3><strong>How it's going to work</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Europa </strong>will start with an orchestra and choir on a very small stage in the middle of the square. But while the music plays, stagehands and actors will begin to bring these pieces towards the stage and connect them, so that the pieces that were, only moments before, being used as board games and seats, become an expanded stage, and the stage grows to 6 times its original size. These elements will then 'perform' as part of the piece.</p>
<p>The effect of an apparently separate artwork at the same festival ‘subsuming’ and ‘defining’ the musical piece is a perfect echo of the themes Europa explores, taking the piece beyond aural entertainment and into the realms of ‘learning play’, where the audience will find their experience of a work redefined completely by things at first seemingly extraneous to the work.</p>
<p>The ability of objects to define experience is Ada’s interest as architectural designers: with this in mind – we will collaborate on expanding the dramatic aspects of the piece to make use of the objects as performers.</p>
<p>This collaboration will also connect two events occurring concurrently in Bloomsbury: the London Festival of Architecture and Donen’s premiere, and can be judged by the degree to which cross-pollination between these events occurs. It will prove the value of cultural events in the Bloomsbury area and prove that the use of public spaces in Bloomsbury for cultural events is not just viable, but hugely successful.</p>
<p>Most excitingly, it will be a surprising and powerful link of two apparently separate works, and will excite a musical audience about the dramatic possibilities of architecture, and an architectural audience about the interaction with music.</p>
<h3><strong><img alt=""and it will look like this"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.adamdonen.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Europa-stage1.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></strong></h3>
<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>We need to buy fabrics and materials. We need to make costumes for our actors, (both animate and inanimate). We need time to create this structure, and time to rehearse it. It's an ambitious undertaking, and while the Bloomsbury Fete are helping us out, their budget stretches only so far, and not so far as what we want to do with this piece. We’re asking the Arts council for funding, we’re asking sponsors for funding, and most importantly, we’re asking you.</p>
<p>To break it down in more detail:</p>
<p>The total cost of the project (including support provided ‘in kind’) is £18,000.</p>
<p>The Midtown Business Club (‘MBC’), for whom the stage is being provided, are very keen to support this performance and stage as the artistic centrepiece of the Fete. To this end, they have secured confirmed sponsorship in kind from Mace Construction, who will provide materials for all architectural designs free of charge (estimated value of £8,000). <br/><br/> MBC have already provided a workshop space free of charge for construction and combined rehearsals with the musicians and actors, beginning 20 May. They are also providing £1500, with which to hire a basic stage structure. And this is where you come in, and provide the funds necessary to build out this stage to its full potential.</p>
<p><strong>If we raise more than £2,000</strong><strong>, it will go directly to improving the quality of the piece further - paying for more rehearsals, more ornate costumes, and bigger robot drummers (REALLY). We'd love it if this happened. We want to create something magical, and huge.</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""and like this..."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.adamdonen.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Europa-stage3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>What's on offer</strong></h3>
<p>We're expecting that everyone who sees the piece is going to want to remember it, and we have plenty of gifts for all ranges of donations.</p>
<p>These range from Donen's CDs and Europa posters to beautiful riso prints (from A4 to A1), ranging right the way up to OWNING a functional piece of the stage after performance (whether a see-saw, steps or similar) and bound editions of the final Europa score (limited to 8 copies!) signed by all the lead musicians, performers and designers. We're also providing the opportunity for you to see the pieces in action, and visits during rehearsals (during either the first or second week of June).</p>
<p>Above all, though, you'll be able to watch a major piece of public drama, mixing all manner of disciplines, and know that you participated directly in its creation.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p><strong><em>To our knowledge, this is the only piece ever written with an inanimate object as the Lead Actor. It's ridiculously ambitious. And just the sort of thing that Indiegogo was made for. </em></strong></p>
<p>The introduction of the architectural medium would greatly enhance the artistic strength of this commission (and drastically increase the likelihood of repeat performances, and provide wonderful showcase material).</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Not working through major arts organisations (one day we'll have a piece at the Royal Opera House, but we're young, and sadly that'll probably be a while yet), we work on a shoestring, but that string needs lengthening. Any help would be received more gratefully than you can imagine. Whatever way, please spread the word about this. Tweet if that's your thing, Facebook, blog, get in touch, talk to us.</p>
<p>And finally if you're in London, come along, play with the architecture, and watch the show - it's free. 14 June. 1pm.  </p></div>","We're five architectural designers working with a composer, and we've been given a major square in the middle of London for a day.

<h3>Le projet</h3>
<p>Afin de sensibiliser le grand public sur les enjeux mondiaux liés à l’eau, l'artiste Belo créera une image composée de 66 000 verres d'eau de pluie colorée simulant les niveaux d'impuretés trouvées dans l'eau partout sur la planète. Cette œuvre majeure,  de 3 600 pieds carrés représentant un enfant dans le ventre maternel, mettra l’accent sur l’essentialité de l’eau pour tout être vivant, avant même sa naissance. Les buts poursuivis par <em>66 000</em> sont multiples : relever le défi artistique et matériel de la réalisation d’une œuvre de cette envergure et conscientiser la population aux conséquences dramatiques du manque d’accessibilité à l’eau potable.</p>
<p><em>66 000 verres comme autant de souhaits pour un monde où la problématique de l’accessibilité à l’eau potable serait chose du passé.</em></p>
<h3><em><img alt=""Fetus pencil_Foetus crayon"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://kalibrequebec.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Fetus-pencil_Foetus-crayon.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></em></h3>
<h3>L’artiste</h3>
<p>Belo, un artiste multidisciplinaire, a développé une technique unique et complexe, qui confère à ses œuvres un aspect tridimensionnel et texturé invitant au toucher. Il compose l'image en fusionnant au canevas des milliers de pièces de peinture acrylique miniatures. Une fois assemblées, de 300 à 600 heures plus tard, ces pièces nous révèlent le thème principal de l’œuvre en un univers tridimensionnel fascinant.</p>
<p>En 2010, Belo se voit décerner le Grand Prix du Jury au Festival International Montréal en Arts (FIMA). Ses œuvres ont été exposées à Montréal, New York et en Espagne.</p>
<p>De la toile murale, Belo adaptera son procédé à la réalisation d’une image plus grande que nature. Cette mosaïque monumentale conçue grâce à l’accumulation de milliers de contenants identiques emplis d’eau colorée donnera une nouvelle perspective à la profondeur de ses œuvres.</p>
<h3>Le rayonnement</h3>
<p>Compte-tenu de la nature éphémère de cette œuvre performative et du caractère universel de la thématique de l'eau, une documentation et une diffusion grand public est indissociable du projet. Une vidéo d’art, un site Internet immersif, une occupation des réseaux sociaux, un documentaire et une diffusion en galerie sont prévus. Une aide au financement permettra ainsi de rejoindre différents publics sur plusieurs plateformes.</p>
<p>L’œuvre performative est prévue pour septembre 2012 et la vidéo d'art sera dévoilée au grand public via Internet dans le cadre de la Journée mondiale de l’eau, le 22 mars 2013.</p>
<h3>Comment vous pouvez nous aider</h3>
<p>Nous cherchons à combler un manque à gagner de 10 000$ pour boucler un budget d'environ 40 000$.</p>
<p>Dans la phase de planification du projet, nous avons contacté un certain nombre d’entreprises et d’organisations à Montréal afin d’explorer les possibilités de partenariats. Nous avons obtenu l’appui de plusieurs d’entre elles, dont notamment pour l’approvisionnement de quelques verres à café, la location d’un espace de 5 000 pieds carrés, la fourniture d’équipement et la production de la vidéo d’art.</p>
<p>Les fonds amassés serviront à couvrir les dépenses pour :</p>
<p>L’œuvre performative (mosaïque d’eau) :</p>
<ul>
<li>achat de verres à café en carton (les verres seront réutilisés ou recyclés par la suite);</li>
<li>achat de matériel de production;</li>
<li>service de traiteur pour nos généreux bénévoles et notre équipe de production;</li>
<li>frais administratifs.</li>
</ul><p>La vidéo d’art :</p>
<ul>
<li>location d’équipement vidéo et d’éclairage;</li>
<li>développement d’une présence Web pour héberger la vidéo d’art, informer la population des enjeux mondiaux liés à l’eau et présenter la liste des partenaires et commanditaires du projet.</li>
</ul><p>Nous vous présentons 9 manières distinctes de contribuer au projet en achetant un des lots (perks) à la droite de l'écran.</p>
<p><em><strong>66,000 sera la plus importante mosaïque artistique d’eau au monde. Vous pouvez en faire partie et faire la différence!</strong></em></p>
<p>Si nous n’atteignons pas notre objectif, nous procéderons tout de même à la réalisation du projet mais nous ne parviendrons pas à créer l’impact souhaité.</p>
<h3>D’autres façons de nous aider</h3>
<p>Si vous ne pouvez pas contribuer financièrement à notre projet, nous vous invitons tout de même à partager par courriel ou via les médias sociaux le lien de notre campagne afin d’augmenter notre visibilité.</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>To raise awareness among the general public about the global clean water crisis, the artist Belo will create an image composed of 66,000 cups of colored rainwater simulating levels of impurities found in water all over the planet. This major work of 3,600 square feet, representing a fetus in the maternal womb, will emphasize the necessity of water, even before birth, for each living person. The goals of <em>66,000</em> are many: taking up the artistic and material challenges inherent to this monumental production, and informing the public of the dramatic consequences of a lack of drinkable water.</p>

<h3>The Artist</h3>
<p>Belo, a mixed media artist, developed a unique and complex technique, which gives his works a tridimensional and textured appearance inviting the onlooker to touch its surfaces. He composes his image by joining thousands of miniature pieces of acrylic paint to his canvas. Once they are joined, 300 to 600 hours later, these pieces reveal the main theme of the work in a fascinating tridimensional universe.</p>
<p>In 2010, Belo won the Grand Prize of the Jury at the Montreal International Art Festival (FIMA). His works have been seen in Montreal, New York and Spain.</p>
<p>From his wall canvases, Belo will adapt his artistic process to the production of a larger-than-life image. This monumental mosaic will be created from the collection of thousands of identical containers filled with colored water which will give a new deeper perspective to his work.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Considering the fleeting and ephemeral nature of this artistic performance, and the universal water theme having inspired the artist, the documentation and large scale diffusion of this project is crucial. An art video, an immersive Internet site, social media participation, a documentary and a gallery showing are foreseen. Financial aid will allow the work to be experienced by a varied public on many levels.The artistic performance is scheduled to take place in September 2012 and the art video will be presented to the public via Internet on World Water Day (March 22, 2013).</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We have set our campaign goal at an achievable $10,000, a figure that covers one-fourth of our expenses. </p>
<p>In the course of our project planning, we have reached out to a number of companies and organizations in Montreal to explore potential partnerships. One of them has agreed to help us by supplying 1,000 coffee cups, an other by making available a 5,000 square foot space and others by lending the team some equipment and producing the art video.</p>

Le projet
Afin de sensibiliser le grand public sur les enjeux mondiaux liés à l’eau, l'artiste Belo créera une image composée de 66 000 verres d'eau de pluie colorée simulant les niveaux d'impuretés trouvées dans l'eau partout sur la planète. Cette œuvre majeure,  de 3 600 pieds carrés représentant un enfant dans le ventre maternel, mettra l’accent sur l’essentialité de l’eau pour tout être vivant, avant même sa naissance. Les buts poursuivis par 66 000 sont multiples : relever le défi artistique et matériel de la réalisation d’une œuvre de cette envergure et conscientiser la population aux conséquences dramatiques du manque d’accessibilité à l’eau potable.
66 000 verres comme autant de souhaits pour un monde où la problématique de l’accessibilité à l’eau potable serait chose du passé.

L’artiste
Belo, un artiste multidisciplinaire, a développé une technique unique et complexe, qui confère à ses œuvres un aspect tridimensionnel et texturé invitant au toucher. Il compose l'image en fusionnant au canevas des milliers de pièces de peinture acrylique miniatures. Une fois assemblées, de 300 à 600 heures plus tard, ces pièces nous révèlent le thème principal de l’œuvre en un univers tridimensionnel fascinant.
En 2010, Belo se voit décerner le Grand Prix du Jury au Festival International Montréal en Arts (FIMA). Ses œuvres ont été exposées à Montréal, New York et en Espagne.
De la toile murale, Belo adaptera son procédé à la réalisation d’une image plus grande que nature. Cette mosaïque monumentale conçue grâce à l’accumulation de milliers de contenants identiques emplis d’eau colorée donnera une nouvelle perspective à la profondeur de ses œuvres.
Le rayonnement
Compte-tenu de la nature éphémère de cette œuvre performative et du caractère universel de la thématique de l'eau, une documentation et une diffusion grand public est indissociable du projet. Une vidéo d’art, un site Internet immersif, une occupation des réseaux sociaux, un documentaire et une diffusion en galerie sont prévus. Une aide au financement permettra ainsi de rejoindre différents publics sur plusieurs plateformes.
L’œuvre performative est prévue pour septembre 2012 et la vidéo d'art sera dévoilée au grand public via Internet dans le cadre de la Journée mondiale de l’eau, le 22 mars 2013.
Comment vous pouvez nous aider
Nous cherchons à combler un manque à gagner de 10 000$ pour boucler un budget d'environ 40 000$.
Dans la phase de planification du projet, nous avons contacté un certain nombre d’entreprises et d’organisations à Montréal afin d’explorer les possibilités de partenariats. Nous avons obtenu l’appui de plusieurs d’entre elles, dont notamment pour l’approvisionnement de quelques verres à café, la location d’un espace de 5 000 pieds carrés, la fourniture d’équipement et la production de la vidéo d’art.
Les fonds amassés serviront à couvrir les dépenses pour :
L’œuvre performative (mosaïque d’eau) :

achat de verres à café en carton (les verres seront réutilisés ou recyclés par la suite);
achat de matériel de production;
service de traiteur pour nos généreux bénévoles et notre équipe de production;
frais administratifs.
La vidéo d’art :

location d’équipement vidéo et d’éclairage;
développement d’une présence Web pour héberger la vidéo d’art, informer la population des enjeux mondiaux liés à l’eau et présenter la liste des partenaires et commanditaires du projet.
Nous vous présentons 9 manières distinctes de contribuer au projet en achetant un des lots (perks) à la droite de l'écran.
66,000 sera la plus importante mosaïque artistique d’eau au monde. Vous pouvez en faire partie et faire la différence!
Si nous n’atteignons pas notre objectif, nous procéderons tout de même à la réalisation du projet mais nous ne parviendrons pas à créer l’impact souhaité.
D’autres façons de nous aider
Si vous ne pouvez pas contribuer financièrement à notre projet, nous vous invitons tout de même à partager par courriel ou via les médias sociaux le lien de notre campagne afin d’augmenter notre visibilité.

<h2>We're Taking This Show On The Road!</h2>
<p>Last summer, The Fully Functional Cabaret was born. Two years in the making, one year in full-tilt production, this all-trans-woman-produced theatrical work was more than song, dance, and tear-away genitalia. It was a moving, transformative love letter to and from trans womanhood.</p>
<p>We made a work that did more than make art, it really felt like a ground-breaking piece of activism. And it only had a two-day run. So we're bringing it back to life!</p>
<p>Our brilliant cast/creators (Star Amerasu, Ryka Aoki, Annie Danger, Red Durkin, Bryn Kelly, and Shawna Virago) live in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City, so every time we put this work out in the world, we have to fund raise. Additionally, we are making art that respects our casts' stories and that, to us, means we would like to be paid for our efforts. Or at least, not lose money for doing important work.</p>
<p>One quite common experience of trans womanhood is isolation. This is our go at peeling back that veil. Please help us take this show on the road!</p>
<div>
<h3>The Full Breakdown:</h3>
<p>We need $2500 dollars to make this show fly high.</p>
<p>Getting our cast eastward is no easy task. In fact, it's costing us nearly $1600. Sure, we get free peanuts and soda on the way, but the cost is still high.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are renting theater space in NYC ($350). We will be printing programs, T-tickets, and Certificates of Good Personhood ($75 per show X 5+ shows = almost $400). We also need to make shirts and DVDs to sell at our merch table, a significant part of our income/our pay for doing this work.</p>
<p>We are sponsored by a small number of college tour stops and by our merchandise table, but we need this money to complete our budget.</p>
<p>Key to the ethics at this show's heart is respecting the stories of the people involved, and in a world where trans women are seriously economically disadvantaged, that can mean paying them. <strong>Any money we make over our goal goes straight into our performers' pockets.</strong></p>
<h3>Prizes and Thanks!</h3>
<ul>
<li>A donation of $20 gets you glossy photo of the cast!</li>
<li>A donation of $35 garners the a handcrafted, artisanal, local thank you note!</li>
<li>A donation of $75 comes with a CD by Shawna Virago!</li>
<li>A donation of $100 gets you a Fully Functional Cabaret t-shirt in a special Donor Blue!</li>
<li>A donation of $250 will bring you stimulating, philosophical tea time with Annie Danger! Ask her anything! (Skype/gChat if necessary)</li>
<li>A donation of $500 or comes with everything listed above <em>AND</em> a specialty ringtone recorded by the entire cast (mp3 available if necessary)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Supporting The Fully Functional Cabaret supports the radical expansion of what trans allyship, trans community, and queer art can look like. We are looking to feed a number of birds with this bush, not the least of which inlcude: creating more brilliant trans culture, putting the 'T' more firmly back into 'LGBT', challenging meanings of allyhood and spectatorship, healing through group performance, experimenting with utopic performatives, paying trans women (!), and planting a seed that can flourish into a nationally-touring show.</p>
<p>Annie Danger, the facilitator of this project, has a long and committed history to transformative (no pun intended...much) performance that doesn't lose a single ounce of fun and humor for all its earnesty. She has brought the world multiple full-length shows, including <em>It's That Easy! With Terry VanWeen!</em>, a motivational seminar for the revolution, and <em>The Great Church of the Holy Fuck</em>, a queer spiritual service about the power and healing in deeply queer sex and bodylove.</p>

Our Impact:
Want to know how the difference our contribution will make?
The effects of Hurricane Sandy were severe, particularly in New Jersey, New York City, its suburbs, and Long Island. Sandy's impacts included the flooding of the NYC subway system, many suburban communities, and all road tunnels entering Manhattan. Numerous homes and businesses were destroyed by fire, including over 100 homes in Queens alone. Large parts of the city and surrounding areas lost electricity for several days, some even went weeks. Large hospitals were closed and evacuated. At least 53 people died in New York as a result of the storm. Economic losses across New York were estimated to be at least $18 billion.

<h2><strong> WHO WE ARE</strong></h2>
<h3>No, we don’t sell antiques at The Geezer Gallery!  Maybe WE are “antiques”, but we embrace life and we love art. The Geezer Gallery is a “whole new old”, where we look at aging as a natural part of the human life course. We geezers take advantage of the wisdom and experience we’ve accumulated through years well lived. Growing old is not something to be disdained – we can live life to the fullest! Join us as we transform perceptions about old into something new.</h3>

<h3>At The Geezer Gallery, we display beautiful master-level art, and ALL of it is created by artists who are age 60 and above! We continue to have purpose in our lives because people are experiencing our art – and buying it. We artists have not packed away our palettes. We are continuing to be or just now becoming known in the community. We feel good knowing that the sale of our art is helping us continue to earn a living, but THAT’S not all. Sales of our art also help support art programs in senior communities, giving other seniors the opportunity to explore creative artistic expression that fosters personal creativity and enhances social connections. But THAT’S not all. It also helps support art therapy programs as a counseling tool to give seniors who need help a voice through artistic expression.</h3>

<h2>FUNDS NEEDED</h2>
<h3>Our campaign shows you who benefits and how. This is very important to those of us who are passionate about changing the perceptions of aging. Our campaign seeks to raise $15,000 to help support the art therapy programs. We artists are proud to be helping achieve this goal!</h3>
<h3>We hope you can hit the donate button TODAY so that, whatever your age, you can help us help other seniors. If you’re not a senior, think of it as an insurance policy for your future when you’re a senior, dispelling that myth that seniors have no value. This is important to all of us because ultimately it will show that seniors are a vital part of our society.</h3>
<h3>You can also help us get the word out by telling others about The Geezer Gallery and how you’re helping.  Share the stories you see on our video. We seniors can prove that it works. Tell others to visit the site and donate too.</h3>

<p><br/>Hello, <br/><br/>My name is Valentina, I am a young and dedicated digital artist who is passionate about my work. I spend most of my time painting and drawing, despite all the challenges I face in life such as recently discovered arthritis. However, aside of my own passion the feedback coming from people is what motivates me to go forward. I've been trying to expose the public to my work for a few years now and it's been going quite well- my facebook  page is currently at +1700 likes from people around the world. I am planning to get into illustration field so I can contribute to video games and other artistic fields. I would very much like to show more people what I am capable of and display my art in a downtown gallery , but I am limited financially- I pay for my college tuition and other needs by myself and it does not leave me with much to spare towards showing my work.<br/><br/>I am hoping to raise enough money before my 21st birthday on April 19th to rent space in the gallery for late spring and print a few more of my paintings on bigger canvases for display. It isn't cheap but offers good exposure, which would allow me to find solid ground for my future as an artist. It would be a big step for me and only a beginning of a long and exciting journey. I am ambitious and hardworking- I know I can and will go far as an artist, but it's the financial side that needs to be invested in at this point. However, if I do not reach my financial goal, I am planning to print art books of my work and distribute them to the galleries- it would be a smaller scale investment but when you have a dream even a small step towards it counts. <br/><br/>I have earned an award from Humber college for Art competition 2012 and I am doing it again next week. For the category I was competing in , I and two other winners have been selected from over 500 submissions, which really showed me that I am heading in the right direction artistically and skill-wise. <br/>I am hoping to win again this year, so please wish me luck! <br/><br/>Even though I can't offer much back at this moment aside of karma points, I can offer some of the perks in return, please look at them. <br/><br/>First 5 contributors will get a signed print of one of my works yours to choose)  upon completion of my campaign, just don't forget to e-mail me right away at:<br/><a href=""mailto:pestilencegraphics@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pestilencegraphics@gmail.com</a> <br/><br/>If the goal is reached I will update all of you on the date the gallery will feature my work and where it is located, so if you are nearby you can pop by and say hello.

<p>Volunteer Group of Artistic Mindsets (VOGRAM) is a non-governmental organization that brings together young activists interested in improving their local communities and global connectivity with positive trends through cultural exchange and activism. Therefore, particularly we support activities and education related to culture, art and creative work, and the values of civil society with a focus on human rights and sustainable development. We organize professional meetings, youth exchanges, seminars, counseling and other forms of education, as well as cultural events, festivals, debates and open discussions. We gather volunteers, who wish to participate in our activities, inform them about the possibilities of local communities and motivate them to become active members of society.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-frc1/995133_427566894025023_1617274509_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The aim of the project is to promote local and regional, young, unknown artists, musicians and bands, to popularize hip hop culture and educate the public about the scale of cultural impact rap music has, taking criticizing point of view to social problems in modern society.</p>
<p>The project is based on a thorough organization and elaborate work, supplemented by experience of the festival ""HIP-HOP URA"" organized in 2006, 2007, and 2008, financially supported by Forum Syd and Youth Center in Novi Sad. </p>
<p>This is the 4th time the festival will be organized, but this time it will be extended to activities other than music performance. The festival will include following activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Music section includes appearance of well known and unknown rap artists from the region</li>
<li>More than 20 mostly less-known individuals and groups, selected according to the quality and potential of affirmation</li>
<li>Graffiti competition - large format canvases</li>
<li>Dancing competition– All Style teams</li>
<li>Competition in extreme skateboarding</li>
<li>Stands for NGO’s</li>
<li>Open discussion on the topic ""Hip-hop between art and life""</li>
<li>Dance workshops with teachers from Urban Dance Crew Hungary in collaboration with the dance association Groove</li>
</ul><p>The festival will be held at an attractive location - Limanski Park in Novi Sad. Dancing competition, graffiti drawing and skateboarding will be held during the day and will be open to the public, while the music program and the finals in the all styles dance competition will be held in the evening in the club ""Factory” along with the musical part of the festival, and it will be available with a ticket.</p>
<p>Our hope is that this project with a lot of work, love and real friends create a traditional event that will grow into a cultural institution of high traffic and high quality.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/1012229_427566887358357_1510178864_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>""Hip Hop URA"" is the only festival of its kind in the country. It comes as a response to the request of a large number of young people who do not have adequate opportunities to enjoy and create within their subculture.</p>
<p>The target group consists of young people from 14 to 30, who are loyal to the hip-hop subculture and ideology that are willing to travel throughout the country and the region to attend these events. They see festivals and gatherings with people who think alike as an extended family event and they experience freeing of the mind, it is a place where they find understanding and support. It is also a way of finding understanding between conflict nations in the Balkans, by building a sense of togetherness and tolerance by using art as a medium of communication. </p>
<p>In Novi Sad there are about 80,000 young people who live here and study. We are looking forward to host at least 1000 people in the course of daily activities, and an additional 450 who will attend the music part of the festival.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/1004915_427566890691690_1047105770_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We need your support to make Hip Hop URA festival happen this year, and we believe that together we can reach this goal. Your contribution will help us host and accommodate artists from the Balkan region, and make them feel comfortable and creative within the festival surroundings. It will help us acquire all the necessary props for artists and competitors as well as to get appropriate awards for the best performers.</p>
<p>This year the project is supported by the city of Novi Sad with 1300EUR but additional finances are necessary. The total cost of the project is 3200EUR (4235USD).</p>

</div></div>","Volunteer Group of Artistic Mindsets (VOGRAM) is a non-governmental organization that brings together young activists interested in improving their local communities and global connectivity with positive trends through cultural exchange and activism. Therefore, particularly we support activities and education related to culture, art and creative work, and the values of civil society with a focus on human rights and sustainable development. We organize professional meetings, youth exchanges, seminars, counseling and other forms of education, as well as cultural events, festivals, debates and open discussions. We gather volunteers, who wish to participate in our activities, inform them about the possibilities of local communities and motivate them to become active members of society.

The aim of the project is to promote local and regional, young, unknown artists, musicians and bands, to popularize hip hop culture and educate the public about the scale of cultural impact rap music has, taking criticizing point of view to social problems in modern society.
The project is based on a thorough organization and elaborate work, supplemented by experience of the festival ""HIP-HOP URA"" organized in 2006, 2007, and 2008, financially supported by Forum Syd and Youth Center in Novi Sad. 
This is the 4th time the festival will be organized, but this time it will be extended to activities other than music performance. The festival will include following activities:

Music section includes appearance of well known and unknown rap artists from the region
More than 20 mostly less-known individuals and groups, selected according to the quality and potential of affirmation
Graffiti competition - large format canvases
Dancing competition– All Style teams
Competition in extreme skateboarding
Stands for NGO’s
Open discussion on the topic ""Hip-hop between art and life""
Dance workshops with teachers from Urban Dance Crew Hungary in collaboration with the dance association Groove
The festival will be held at an attractive location - Limanski Park in Novi Sad. Dancing competition, graffiti drawing and skateboarding will be held during the day and will be open to the public, while the music program and the finals in the all styles dance competition will be held in the evening in the club ""Factory” along with the musical part of the festival, and it will be available with a ticket.
Our hope is that this project with a lot of work, love and real friends create a traditional event that will grow into a cultural institution of high traffic and high quality.

""Hip Hop URA"" is the only festival of its kind in the country. It comes as a response to the request of a large number of young people who do not have adequate opportunities to enjoy and create within their subculture.
The target group consists of young people from 14 to 30, who are loyal to the hip-hop subculture and ideology that are willing to travel throughout the country and the region to attend these events. They see festivals and gatherings with people who think alike as an extended family event and they experience freeing of the mind, it is a place where they find understanding and support. It is also a way of finding understanding between conflict nations in the Balkans, by building a sense of togetherness and tolerance by using art as a medium of communication. 
In Novi Sad there are about 80,000 young people who live here and study. We are looking forward to host at least 1000 people in the course of daily activities, and an additional 450 who will attend the music part of the festival.

We need your support to make Hip Hop URA festival happen this year, and we believe that together we can reach this goal. Your contribution will help us host and accommodate artists from the Balkan region, and make them feel comfortable and creative within the festival surroundings. It will help us acquire all the necessary props for artists and competitors as well as to get appropriate awards for the best performers.
This year the project is supported by the city of Novi Sad with 1300EUR but additional finances are necessary. The total cost of the project is 3200EUR (4235USD).

<p class=""bold x-large notranslate"">My name is  <a href=""http://www.stefanfalke.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">STEFAN FALKE</a>, I am a German born photographer in Brooklyn, New York. </p>
<h2 class=""bold x-large notranslate"">LA FRONTERA: Artists along the US Mexican Border</h2>
<p class=""bold x-large notranslate"">is my newest project. I started to photograph artists in Tijuana in 2008 because I wanted to show that there is more to the border region than bad news. My first series of photographs inspired me to go further.</p>
<p class=""bold x-large notranslate"">I decided to visit and portray artists along the entire 2000 miles long US-Mexican border because the media reports from the border regions are still almost entirely focusing on violent crime.</p>
<h3><strong>I want to tell another story.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>I am hoping that my LA FRONTERA project will help to put a spotlight on the vibrant cultural life along the border that most people in the US and other countries know very little about.</strong></p>

<p>I went back to Baja California earlier this year to visit and photograph <strong><a href=""http://www.stefanfalke.com/#/personal/La%20Frontera%20new%20portraits/1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">more artists</a> </strong>along the border in <strong>Tijuana, Tecate and Mexicali.</strong></p>
<p>At the same time I was invited to show my work at<strong> La Casa Del Tunel: Art Center</strong> in <strong>Tijuana</strong>, where I also held a 4 day workshop for local photographers.</p>
<p>The exhibition was very well received and publicized in the press. As a result, I became connected to more artists and art institutions. The German embassy in Mexico City published an <a href=""http://www.mexiko.diplo.de/Vertretung/mexiko/es/DZ__00/04__Cultura/Artes/StefanFalkeTijuana__Seite.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">interview</a> with me about the exhibition and my work at the border (in Spanish).</p>
<p>Now I am planning a <strong>3 months trip</strong> to visit again <strong>Tijuana, Tecate, Mexicali, </strong><strong>Nogales, Juarez, Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa, Matamoros</strong> <strong>and smaller towns along the border</strong> to meet artists in their homes and studios. I also want to explore <strong>San Diego, El Paso and Brownsville</strong> <strong>as well as other towns on the US side</strong> where many artists live and work.</p>

<p>I am hoping to go back to the border in early November after working on magazine assignments about the Presidential Elections in the US. The length of my trip along the border ultimately depends on how much money I will have. I am planning for 3 month because of the distances and my experience with the earier visits. It often takes a lot of time to arrange meetings and coordinate travel and visits. I will also photograph landscape and the border fence in many locations.</p>
<p>Luckily the nature of this project allows for separate trips to different regions in case I need to come back to New York to search for more financial support.</p>
<p>My long-term goal is to produce a book about the project similar in scope to my 215-page photo book about a stilt walking school in Trinidad. It was published under the title <a href=""http://www.stefanfalke.com/#/stories/Moko%20Jumbies/1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Moko Jumbies: The Dancing Spirits of Trinidad</strong></a> by <a href=""http://www.pointedleafpress.com/moko-jumbies"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pointed Leaf Press</a> in New York. Photographs from the book were exhibited at <strong>VISA POUR L'IMAGE</strong>, the famous photojournalism festival in Perpignan/France and the story was published in magazines all over the world. (<a href=""http://www.stefanfalke.com/#/published/magazines/13/thumbs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tear sheets</a>)</p>
<p><strong>(The production of a final book is NOT part of this fundraising effort. This campaign is needed to cover the costs to produce the photographs along the border that will eventually become a book. But I will design a spezial edition with images from LA FRONTERA on blurb.com as a gift for my supporters)</strong></p>

<p>I already created a <a href=""http://borderartists.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>blog</strong></a> which will include photos and information about every artist who is part of the project. I will further improve the site when I return from the next trip. </p>
<p><strong>Please also visit and like the project's <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/LaFronteraArtistsAlongTheUsMexicanBorder"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">facebook page</a> !!</strong></p>
<p>Interviews and stories will be written by <strong>Claudia Steinberg</strong>, an internationally published journalist based in New York City. She has participated in previous trips and will join me at different locations during my travels. In addition <strong>I will ask poets, novelists and <strong>journalists</strong> from the various regions along the border to contribute texts about their experiences of life at La Frontera.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>However, at this stage my most urgent concern is to be able to go back and continue to photograph artists along the border.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I financed the first trips myself,</strong> <strong>but now I need your help to continue this project.</strong></p>
<p>Even though I have been awarded a grant (8,000 Euro) from a German foundation (Stiftung Kulturwerk der VG BILD-KUNST)<strong> </strong>I still need more funds for the 3 month trip: 90 days car rental - up to 70 $ per day in Mexico / car insurance in mexico / gas - I expect to drive at least 5000 miles / up to 90 motel nights / add. equipment: Nikon D 800 for video interviews (what I really want: the more expensive Nikon D4) /  microphone for video etc / add. digital storage / min. 2 return flights NY - border /communication / local assistants /  ...)</p>
<p>I will also continue to write proposals for grants from foundations because I can see myself spending much more time working on this project than the initial 3 month. Grant writing and receiving is a slow process. This fundraising campaign will hopefully allow me to continue with the work in November 2012.</p>

<p>Hallo,</p>
<p>mein Name ist <a href=""http://www.stefanfalke.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Stefan Falke</strong></a>, ein deutscher Fotograf in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
<p> Mein neuestes Projekt heißt</p>
<p><strong>LA FRONTERA: Künstler entlang der US - mexikanischen Grenze</strong></p>
<p>Ich fing 2008 an Künstler in Tijuana zu fotografieren, weil ich zeigen wollte, dass es nicht nur schlechte Nachrichten von der Grenze zu berichten gab. Meine <a href=""http://www.stefanfalke.com/#/stories/La%20Frontera/1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">erste Serie</a> von Bildern inspirierte mich dazu, weiter zu gehen.</p>
<p> Ich entschied mich Künstler entlang der gesamten 2000 Meilen langen US-mexikanischen Grenze zu besuchen und zu fotografieren, weil die internationalen Medien aus den Grenzregionen fast immer nur mit dem Schwerpunkt Gewaltverbrechen berichten. </p>
<p>Ich möchte eine andere Geschichte zu erzählen.</p>

<p>Zu Beginn dieses Jahres war ich wieder in Baja California um weitere Künstler in Tijuana, Tecate und Mexicali zu fotografieren.</p>
<p> Zur gleichen Zeit wurde ich eingeladen, meine Arbeit im La Casa Del Tunel zeigen: Art Center in Tijuana zu zeigen, wo ich auch einen 4-tägigen Workshop für lokale Fotografen unterrichtete. </p>
<p>Die Ausstellung wurde sehr gut angenommen und in der mexikanischen Presse veröffentlicht. Dadurch lernte ich weitere Künstler und Kunstinstitutionen kennen.

(PS upfront: My promise, I will go back to the border in late November and continue the project with your contribution, even if I don't reach the financial goal. Still every dolllar counts :-)
 
My name is  STEFAN FALKE, I am a German born photographer in Brooklyn, New York. 
LA FRONTERA: Artists along the US Mexican Border
is my newest project. I started to photograph artists in Tijuana in 2008 because I wanted to show that there is more to the border region than bad news. My first series of photographs inspired me to go further.
I decided to visit and portray artists along the entire 2000 miles long US-Mexican border because the media reports from the border regions are still almost entirely focusing on violent crime.
I want to tell another story.
I am hoping that my LA FRONTERA project will help to put a spotlight on the vibrant cultural life along the border that most people in the US and other countries know very little about.



I went back to Baja California earlier this year to visit and photograph more artists along the border in Tijuana, Tecate and Mexicali.
At the same time I was invited to show my work at La Casa Del Tunel: Art Center in Tijuana, where I also held a 4 day workshop for local photographers.
The exhibition was very well received and publicized in the press. As a result, I became connected to more artists and art institutions. The German embassy in Mexico City published an interview with me about the exhibition and my work at the border (in Spanish).
Now I am planning a 3 months trip to visit again Tijuana, Tecate, Mexicali, Nogales, Juarez, Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa, Matamoros and smaller towns along the border to meet artists in their homes and studios. I also want to explore San Diego, El Paso and Brownsville as well as other towns on the US side where many artists live and work.
 

 

I am hoping to go back to the border in early November after working on magazine assignments about the Presidential Elections in the US. The length of my trip along the border ultimately depends on how much money I will have. I am planning for 3 month because of the distances and my experience with the earier visits. It often takes a lot of time to arrange meetings and coordinate travel and visits. I will also photograph landscape and the border fence in many locations.
Luckily the nature of this project allows for separate trips to different regions in case I need to come back to New York to search for more financial support.
My long-term goal is to produce a book about the project similar in scope to my 215-page photo book about a stilt walking school in Trinidad. It was published under the title Moko Jumbies: The Dancing Spirits of Trinidad by Pointed Leaf Press in New York. Photographs from the book were exhibited at VISA POUR L'IMAGE, the famous photojournalism festival in Perpignan/France and the story was published in magazines all over the world. (tear sheets)
(The production of a final book is NOT part of this fundraising effort. This campaign is needed to cover the costs to produce the photographs along the border that will eventually become a book. But I will design a spezial edition with images from LA FRONTERA on blurb.com as a gift for my supporters)
 
I already created a blog which will include photos and information about every artist who is part of the project. I will further improve the site when I return from the next trip. 
Please also visit and like the project's facebook page !!
Interviews and stories will be written by Claudia Steinberg, an internationally published journalist based in New York City. She has participated in previous trips and will join me at different locations during my travels. In addition I will ask poets, novelists and journalists from the various regions along the border to contribute texts about their experiences of life at La Frontera. 
However, at this stage my most urgent concern is to be able to go back and continue to photograph artists along the border.
I financed the first trips myself, but now I need your help to continue this project.
Even though I have been awarded a grant (8,000 Euro) from a German foundation (Stiftung Kulturwerk der VG BILD-KUNST) I still need more funds for the 3 month trip: 90 days car rental - up to 70 $ per day in Mexico / car insurance in mexico / gas - I expect to drive at least 5000 miles / up to 90 motel nights / add. equipment: Nikon D 800 for video interviews (what I really want: the more expensive Nikon D4) /  microphone for video etc / add. digital storage / min. 2 return flights NY - border /communication / local assistants /  ...)
I will also continue to write proposals for grants from foundations because I can see myself spending much more time working on this project than the initial 3 month. Grant writing and receiving is a slow process. This fundraising campaign will hopefully allow me to continue with the work in November 2012.
Whatever you can contribute to this project will be very much appreciated. And if you just post this video on your facebook page or tell others about it … that would be fantastic !! :-)

Hola,
mi nombre es Stefan FALKE, soy fotógrafo de origen alemán y vivo en Brooklyn, Nueva York.Mi nuevo proyecto se llama LA FRONTERA: Artistas a lo largo de la frontera entre Mexico y EE.UU.Comencé a fotografiar a artistas en Tijuana en 2008 porque quería mostrar que hay más en la frontera que solo malas noticias. Mi primera serie de imágenes me inspiró a ir más allá.Decidí a visitar y retratar a artistas en todas las 2000 millas a lo largo de la frontera  de México con Estados Unidos, ya que los informes de los medios de las regiones fronterizas son todavía casi totalmente centrados en la delincuencia violenta.Quiero contarles una historia diferente.Espero que mi proyecto LA FRONTERA pondrá el foco en la vida cultural vibrante a lo largo de la frontera de la que la mayoría de las personas en los EE.UU. y en otros países saben muy poco.

Volví a la frontera en Baja California a principios de este año para visitar y fotografiar a más artistas en Tijuana,Tecate y Mexicali.
Al mismo tiempo, me invitaron a exponer mi trabajo en La Casa Del Tunel: Art Center en Tijuana, donde también realizé un taller de cuatro días para fotógrafos locales.La exposición fue muy bien recibida y publicada en la prensa. Como resultado, me conecté a aun más artistas e instituciones artísticas. La embajada alemana en la Ciudad de México publicó una entrevista conmigo acerca de la exposición y mi trabajo en la frontera (en español).Me sentí cada vez más animado a continuar mi trabajo de LA FRONTERA.Ahora estoy planeando un viaje de 3 meses para visitar a Tijuana, Tecate, Mexicali, Nogales, Ciudad Juárez, NuevoLaredo, Reynosa, Matamoros y ciudades más pequeñas a lo largo de la frontera para conocer a los artistas en sus casas y sua talleres. También quiero explorar a San Diego, El Paso y Brownsville, así como otras ciudades del lado de EE.UU., donde muchos artistas viven y trabajan.Espero poder volver a la frontera a principios de noviembre después de finalizar algunos  encargos de revistas sobre las elecciones presidenciales en EE.UU.. En última instancia, la duración de mi viaje a lo largo de la frontera depende de la cantidad de dinero que puedo juntar. Estoy planeando para un viaje de 3 meses debido a las distancias que hay que recorrer y a base de mis experiencias en visitas anteriores. Se necesita mucho tiempo para encontrar a los artistas y organizar citas con los artistas.Por suerte, la naturaleza de este proyecto permite tener varios viajes a diferentes regiones en el caso que tengo que volver a Nueva York en busqueda de apoyos financieros adicionales.Mi meta a largo plazo es producir un libro sobre el proyecto similar en volume a mi libro de fotos de 215 páginas sobre la escuela de andar en zancos en Trinidad. Se publicó bajo el título MOKO JUMBIES: Los espíritus danzantes de Trinidad por la editorial Pointed Leaf Press en Nueva York. Fotografías de este libro se exhibieron en VISA POUR L’IMAGE, el famoso festival de fotoperiodismo en Perpignan/Francia y la historia se public en revistas de todo el mundo (Ver hojas individuales de papel).(La producción de un libro definitivo no es parte de este esfuerzo de recaudación de fondos. Esta campaña es necesaria para cubrir los costos de producción de las fotografías a lo largo de la frontera que, con el tiempo, se convertirán en libro. Pero voy a diseñar una edición especial con imágenes de LA FRONTERA  en blurb.com como un regalo para mis aportadores).Ya he creado un blog que incluirá fotos e información sobre cada artista que participa en el proyecto. Incluso mejoraré aun más la página web cuando regreso de mi siguiente viaje.
Por favor, también visite y gusta la página facebook del proyecto!
Las entrevistas y las historias estarán escritas por Claudia Steinberg, una periodista publicada a nivel internacional con sede en Nueva York. Ha participado en viajes anteriores y se juntaráconmigo en diferentes lugares durante mis viajes. Además voy a pedir a poetas, novelistas y periodistas de las diversas regiones a lo largo de la frontera que contribuyeran textos sobre sus experiencias vitales en La Frontera.Sin embargo, en este momento mi preocupación más urgente es poder volver y continuar a fotografiar artistas a lo largo de la frontera.Los primeros viajes he pagado e mi propio bolsillo, sin embargo,  ahora necesito la ayuda de vosotros para continuar con este proyecto.A pesar de que me han concedido una beca (8.000 euros) de una fundación alemana (Stiftung Kulturwerk der VG Bild-Kunst), me faltan aun más fondos para los tres meses,  como por ejemplo gastos de viaje, equipo adicional, varios seguros así como asistentes locales.Lo qué necesito para 3 mes:90 días de alquiler de coch - hasta 70 $ por día en México / seguro de automóvil en México / gasolina – Asumo que voy a recorrer por lo menos unas 5000 millas / 90 noches de motel /Equipo addicional: Nikon D 800 para vídeo (mejor aún: la D4) / micrófono etc / almacenamiento digital addicional/ 2 vuelos de regreso NY - frontera / asistencia local / comunicación (los costes de itinerancia/roaming) / ...)Lo que sea que  usted pueda contribuir a este proyecto será muy apreciado. E incluso si somplemente publica este video en su página de facebook o le dice a otros acerca del proyecto ... eso sería fantástico! :-)

Hallo,
mein Name ist Stefan Falke, ein deutscher Fotograf in Brooklyn, New York.
 Mein neuestes Projekt heißt
LA FRONTERA: Künstler entlang der US - mexikanischen Grenze
Ich fing 2008 an Künstler in Tijuana zu fotografieren, weil ich zeigen wollte, dass es nicht nur schlechte Nachrichten von der Grenze zu berichten gab. Meine erste Serie von Bildern inspirierte mich dazu, weiter zu gehen.
 Ich entschied mich Künstler entlang der gesamten 2000 Meilen langen US-mexikanischen Grenze zu besuchen und zu fotografieren, weil die internationalen Medien aus den Grenzregionen fast immer nur mit dem Schwerpunkt Gewaltverbrechen berichten. 
Ich möchte eine andere Geschichte zu erzählen.
 Ich hoffe mein LA FRONTERA Projekt kann dabei helfen ein Schlaglicht auf das lebendige kulturelle Leben entlang der Grenze zu werfen. Ein Leben von dem die meisten Menschen in den USA und anderen Ländern sehr wenig wissen.
 
 

 
Zu Beginn dieses Jahres war ich wieder in Baja California um weitere Künstler in Tijuana, Tecate und Mexicali zu fotografieren.
 Zur gleichen Zeit wurde ich eingeladen, meine Arbeit im La Casa Del Tunel zeigen: Art Center in Tijuana zu zeigen, wo ich auch einen 4-tägigen Workshop für lokale Fotografen unterrichtete. 
Die Ausstellung wurde sehr gut angenommen und in der mexikanischen Presse veröffentlicht. Dadurch lernte ich weitere Künstler und Kunstinstitutionen kennen. Die deutsche Botschaft in Mexico City veröffentlichte dazu ein Interview mit mir über die Ausstellung und meine Arbeit an der Grenze (in Spanisch).
Jetzt plane ich eine 3 monatige Reise nach Tijuana, Tecate, Mexicali, Nogales, Juarez, Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa, Matamoros und zu kleineren Städten entlang der Grenze um Künstler in ihren Häusern und Studios zu besuchen. Ich möchte auch San Diego, El Paso und Brownsville sowie andere Städte auf der US-Seite, wo viele Künstler leben und arbeiten, erkunden.

Ich hoffe gleich nach den Präsidentschaftswahlen in den USA mit meiner Arbiet fortfahren zu können. Die Länge der Reise entlang der Grenze hängt letztlich davon ab, wie viel Geld ich dafür haben werde. Wegen der grossen Entfernungen plane ich für 3 Monate. Auch braucht es nach den Erfahrungen meiner letzten Reise es oft viel Zeit, um Treffen mit Künstlern zu arrangieren und zu koordinieren. Auch Landschafts und Fotos vom Grenzzaun an verschiedenen Orten nimmt viel Zeit in Anspruch.
Zum Glück ermöglicht dieses Projekts separate Reisen in verschiedene Regionen, für den Fall das ich nach New York zurückkehren müsste um weitere finanzielle Unterstützung zu finden.
Mein langfristiges Ziel ist es ein Buch über das Projekt zu veröffentlichen, ähnlich in Grösse und Umfang meines 215-Seiten Fotobuches über ein Stelzenlauf Schule in Trinidad. Das Buch wurde von Pointed Leaf Press in New York unter dem Titel MOKO JUMBIES: The Dancing Spirits of Trinidad veröffentlicht. Fotografien aus dem Buch wurden auf dem Fotojournalismus-Festival Visa pour l'Image in Perpignan / Frankreich ausgestellt und die Bilder wurde in Magazinen auf der ganzen Welt veröffentlicht. (Siehe Auszüge)
(Die Herstellung eines endgültigen Buch ist nicht Teil dieser Spendenaktion. Diese Spendenkampagne ist nötig, um die Kosten zu decken, die Fotografien entlang der Grenze zu produzieren. Ich werde aber eine Sonder-Edition mit Bildern aus LA FRONTERA auf blurb.com als Geschenk für meine Unterstützer auflegen) 
 Ich habe bereits ein Blog online gestellt auf dem Fotos und Informationen über jeden Künstler, welcher Teil des Projekts ist, enthalten sein wird. Nach der nächsten Reise wird der Blog zu einer Webseite wachsen.

If you couldn't tell, I'm a crafter. I live for the moment when I finish a project and see it come to life in my hands. I want to have fun with my work and share it with the world. And I hope in this project you can see that!

My name is Aaron Alviano and I am a visual artist that specializes in photography, painting and sculpture. I am originally from Guelph, Canada where I studied and received my Bachelors of Fine Art. Since then I have moved to the ""big city"" of Toronto, Canada and have put on several art shows through out southern Ontario. 

My most recent project, ‘Infinite Answers’ is an intricate look at the relationship between the pictorials of Art and Mathematics. Mathematics applies universally recognized symbols to create meaning which transcends all linguistic barriers. In Art, meaning similarly transcends linguistic barriers by the use of pictorials, but the resulting meaning has a subjectivity that is usually considered the polar opposite of Mathematics; except where Mathematics operates in its purest form. ‘Infinite Answers’ sets out to explore the relationship between the logical-pictorial language of Mathematics and the subjective-pictorial language of Fine Art through the creation of randomly generated and ultimately meaningless artistic ‘equations’.

These universally-recognized images have been manipulated graphically for the purpose of this installation so that they can be projected in random sequences and in large format, with the aid of five projectors. Each image forms one fifth of a nonsensical equation; images are generated randomly by each of the five projectors, creating an infinite number of possible equations. Unlike the opposing universal language of Mathematics, each artistic ‘equation’ invites a response in the viewer that is entirely subjective. The purpose is to question the relationship, and diametrical opposition, of the pictorial languages of Mathematics and Art. 

 
‘Infinite Answers’ is flexible in design and can function effectively in both an interior or exterior space. However an interior space would be ideal for it would allow the projections to be accompanied with the painting series, creating a higher visual stimulus and audience interaction. An interior space would also have a higher safety value given that the use of electronics is mandatory.

A date has been set for this show, Saturday September the 29th 2012. This coincides with Nuit Blanche, an all night Art Festival here in Toronto, Canada. My application has been submitted to the festival, and I will keep you posted if I am accepted. Regardless, the city streets will be crowded with art enthusiasts, so I will still have my show on this date. 

A location has been found, and negotiation is currently ongoing for use of the site for this coming September. The space also provides its own projectors and the facility and has ample room for both the paintings and the projections. The venue in question can also accommodate a large crowd, so there would be no concerns of line ups or over crowding.



What your help will do for this project

About 85% of the money being raised for this project will go towards the rental fee of a venue space, use of their equipment and staff for a full 24 hours. 
 
The remainder will go towards painting supplies and equipment needed to put on an amazing show.

At FMLY Fest this December 29 and 30, DUM DUM Zine is doing its second crowd-sourced disposable camera installation! We've launched this campaign in order to raise the money we need in order to buy, install and develop the disposable cameras.
  
  

We
tethered four disposable cameras to DUM DUM signs FYFest this summer, and asked concert-goers to
take snapshots of their experience. This time weâ€™re upgrading to TEN cameras (or more, depending on how much money we make!) spread out over the course of two days of the festival. 

  

At the end of this social experiment, we'll publish all the fantastic footage on the DUM DUM website for festival-goers and DUM DUM readers to click through and enjoy. Check out the original gallery HERE! 





The Impact


Photographers and fans
often spend more time taking photos than actually enjoying festivals. Weâ€™ve
learned that the most genuine way to have a good festival experience is to
interact with itâ€”weâ€™ll handle the photo part so that you guys can have fun! At
the end of the night weâ€™ll collect the cameras and publish the photos on our
website. 



What We Need & What You Get
Unfortunately, nostalgia has its price. Film and development isnâ€™t cheapâ€”we need your help in order to buy, install, and develop the photos from our installation. 

We don't need much: even a simple $5 is almost enough to buy one disposable camera!

From the start, we've built DUM DUM together ourselves. The fine folks over at FMLY Fest are doing it all together and doing it all themselves. It's an honor to be a part of such a wonderful communal movement, and we would really like to make an artistic contribution as DUM DUM to all the FMLY fun. Help bring the community closer together!

All the funds earned from our IndieGoGo campaign will directly fund the purchase, installation and development of the disposable camera project. Any proceeds from the funds will go straight into DUM DUM's next camera project, 27 DUM DAYS: A Disposable Camera Tumblr, launching January 1, 2012.


Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word and ""Share"" this campaign on your Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, and more! 

Come along to FMLY Fest and have some fun while supporting amazing artists!

Tell all your friends to join in on the fun, too!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Why:  To create unique, creative opportunities that motivate students to learn and succeed in school.  Research shows that ""quality instruction in music, dance, theatre and visual art results in a wide array of social and academic benefits for students, including the ability to keep students in school and on track for graduation.""

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Alon Atlanta. I, together with more than 100 artists from all over the southeast, are creating ""Burn to Peace.""  Already, we have begun to have big pARTies in the Atlanta area.  Through art and creativity, we are building a community. The money donated will go to the idea of bringing people throughout the world together through this principle.<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The idea is to show as many people as possible how a positive community can bring people together.  One of our ways of connection is through art and the Burning Man lifestyle, which focuses on the 10 Burning Man principles.  We believe through this way of life, we can find happiness while being surrounded by art.</p>
<p>The 10 Burning Man Principles are:</p>
<p>""<span class=""subhead"">Radical Inclusion</span><br/>Anyone may be a part of Burning Man. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community.</p>
<p><span class=""subhead"">Gifting</span><br/>Burning Man is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.</p>
<p><span class=""subhead"">Decommodification</span><br/>In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.</p>
<p><span class=""subhead"">Radical Self-reliance</span><br/>Burning Man encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources.</p>
<p><span class=""subhead"">Radical Self-expression</span><br/>Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content.  It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient.</p>
<p><span class=""subhead"">Communal Effort</span><br/>Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction.</p>
<p><span class=""subhead"">Civic Responsibility</span><br/>We value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.</p>
<p><span class=""subhead"">Leaving No Trace</span><br/>Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.</p>
<p><span class=""subhead"">Participation</span><br/>Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart.</p>
<p><span class=""subhead"">Immediacy</span><br/>Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture.  We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers.  No idea can substitute for this experience.""</p>

<p>We need $100,000 to create our first burn which will be October 2012 in Israel.  The middle east is a prime example of a place that needs to be brought together and we feel that we can be an insturment in bringing people together.<br/></p>

<p>The Fully Functional Cabaret is about to be born! Two years in the making, one year in full-tilt production, this project is more than song, dance, and inflatable genitalia.</p>
<p>FFC is a theatrical performance by a group of six trans women, three from San Francisco, Two from New York, and one from Los Angeles. We are, at the core of our efforts, working to produce an honest and heartfelt love letter to trans womanhood.</p>
<p>Beyond that, we hope to reach out to our wider communities to say: ""No More Sob Stories!"" Our tales will be told with incandescent aplomb by our deepest selves. The hard parts will never be overcome if we don't reach past victimhood with brighter expectations.</p>
<p>One quite common experience of trans womanhood is isolation. This is our go at peeling back that veil.</p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

</div></div>","Fully Functional!
The Fully Functional Cabaret is about to be born! Two years in the making, one year in full-tilt production, this project is more than song, dance, and inflatable genitalia.
FFC is a theatrical performance by a group of six trans women, three from San Francisco, Two from New York, and one from Los Angeles. We are, at the core of our efforts, working to produce an honest and heartfelt love letter to trans womanhood.
Beyond that, we hope to reach out to our wider communities to say: ""No More Sob Stories!"" Our tales will be told with incandescent aplomb by our deepest selves. The hard parts will never be overcome if we don't reach past victimhood with brighter expectations.
One quite common experience of trans womanhood is isolation. This is our go at peeling back that veil.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi there. My name is Heather Johnson; I’ve been a practicing visual artist for close to 20 years. Late last year I was offered a month-long Artist Residency fellowship at <a href=""http://boxoprojects.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""BoxoPROJECTS"">BoxoHOUSE</a>, a residency program in Joshua Tree, California dedicated to the investigation and development of ideas related to place, community and the environment.  </p>
<p>This is a dream come true for me - part of something I've fantasized of ever since I made the unlikely discovery 6 years ago that despite my small size, I am capable of riding motorcycles. I took it as a sign, and gave notice at my job.</p>
<p><em>This spring, I will ride my motorcycle from my home in northern New Jersey to Joshua Tree, beyond and back, alone.</em> I will make a new collection of art works based on my experiences in Joshua Tree, the Mojave Desert and what I see during this journey...<em>and I will leave a trail of art works at sites around the country, that anyone can encounter, take and keep.</em></p>
<p>To do this, I need your help.</p>

<h3><strong>Me, my work and <em>the frightening and beautiful</em></strong></h3>
<p>Riding a motorcycle feels like flying. Other than a helmet and protective leathers, there are no barriers to isolate you from the wind, passing trees or the road itself.  There is no cinematic lens through which to view the passing landscape - you are a part of the landscape itself.</p>
<p><em>My work is about the relationship between the land, the sky and my own body</em>. I am fascinated with the movement inside an engine as it relates to circulations within the body itself. The repeating, propelling explosions of a combustion engine express a profound statement about creativity – the necessity of destruction in the act of creation.  I make embroideries, using stitches fine enough to give the appearance of pen-and-ink line drawings from a distance.  This repetitive labor is sweetly cyclical, a slow meditation upon the rapid-fire action of the pistons that feed its inspiration.  Layers of information overlap and are woven together to bring about new relationships and meanings as I try to make sense of this enormous universe within which we are spinning continuously.  You can learn more about my work and background via my website at <a href=""http://www.heatherLjohnson.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.heatherLjohnson.com</a>.</p>

<h3>Why do I need money, and where is it going?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Well, it's quite simple. A 10,000 mile road trip is an expensive proposition, no matter how frugal you are.  I will camp, stay with friends and eat from food stands, grocery stores and cheap diners whenever possible. Though my bike sips gas, fuel alone will run around $1000 for the trip and my month-long stay in Joshua Tree.  </p>
<p>My $11,500 goal will cover not only food, accommodations and gas, but motorcycle maintenance, art project-related expenses, and my share of the rent that still must be paid while I'm gone.  There is also some allotted for the unforeseen, such as towing, incident-related bike repairs and 2 months of health insurance that I really hope I don't need.</p>
<p><em>Even the smallest donation will help tremendously!</em></p>
<p>$10 will pay for a tank of gas or lunch somewhere on the road.  $25 will get me a campsite and a bundle of wood for a campfire.  $50 will buy me a room on the inevitable night I get caught in a crazy thunderstorm.  If you wanna get really generous, $500 will pay for the 6000-mile service my bike will need once I get to Joshua Tree!</p>
<h3>What'll you get in return?</h3>
<p>Aside from my deep and permanent gratitude, I've created a few perks I hope you will enjoy.  For a donation of $25, you will get an acknowledgement in my blog and on Facebook, as well as a signed photograph taken on the trip and email updates sent from the road; for $25 more I'll also send you a hand-written postcard from one of the cities or towns I pass through.</p>
<p>For those willing to shell out $125 or more, you'll get everything mentioned plus a signed book packed with images and anecdotes that'll make a great keepsake.   For $250 I will stitch your name by hand to a linen swatch and let it fly out into the landscape forever in your honor... you will of course get a photograph of this.  And if you are one of those rare souls in the position to donate really big sums, there are original works of art in it for you! </p>
<p>Your assistance will help raise the visibility of women motorcyclists in the U.S. and will blur boundaries between the two very distinct worlds of art practice and motorcycle culture. <em> But most importantly, you will be supporting a dream that, to me, signifies the heart and soul of what most work so hard for – freedom -- to roam, to create, to squeeze every drop of meaning out of life.</em></p>

<p>We are all still struggling like hell in this unfortunate economy.  Many of you east-coasters affected by Hurricane Sandy are still coping with the damage it wrought, and will be hurting from that for a long time to come.  Others face challenges I can't begin to fathom that make this campaign seem trivial.  </p>
<p><strong>If helping financially is not an option, I hope you'll help me spread the word!</strong>  </p>

Hi there. My name is Heather Johnson; I’ve been a practicing visual artist for close to 20 years. Late last year I was offered a month-long Artist Residency fellowship at BoxoHOUSE, a residency program in Joshua Tree, California dedicated to the investigation and development of ideas related to place, community and the environment.  
This is a dream come true for me - part of something I've fantasized of ever since I made the unlikely discovery 6 years ago that despite my small size, I am capable of riding motorcycles. I took it as a sign, and gave notice at my job.
This spring, I will ride my motorcycle from my home in northern New Jersey to Joshua Tree, beyond and back, alone. I will make a new collection of art works based on my experiences in Joshua Tree, the Mojave Desert and what I see during this journey...and I will leave a trail of art works at sites around the country, that anyone can encounter, take and keep.
To do this, I need your help.

Me, my work and the frightening and beautiful
Riding a motorcycle feels like flying. Other than a helmet and protective leathers, there are no barriers to isolate you from the wind, passing trees or the road itself.  There is no cinematic lens through which to view the passing landscape - you are a part of the landscape itself.
My work is about the relationship between the land, the sky and my own body. I am fascinated with the movement inside an engine as it relates to circulations within the body itself. The repeating, propelling explosions of a combustion engine express a profound statement about creativity – the necessity of destruction in the act of creation.  I make embroideries, using stitches fine enough to give the appearance of pen-and-ink line drawings from a distance.  This repetitive labor is sweetly cyclical, a slow meditation upon the rapid-fire action of the pistons that feed its inspiration.  Layers of information overlap and are woven together to bring about new relationships and meanings as I try to make sense of this enormous universe within which we are spinning continuously.  You can learn more about my work and background via my website at http://www.heatherLjohnson.com.

<h2>Our Goal: Rehabilitate former child soldiers through painting</h2>
<p>Thousands of young boys were kidnapped, given drugs, and made to fight in a 14-year civil war. They were forced to commit the worst atrocities and war crimes known to man. After the war, they were abandoned and rejected. Their generals disappeared, their families rejected them, and society has driven them out. Now, they are homeless and without skills to create a normal life.</p>
<p><img alt=""Nathan in Liberia"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.sahbu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/IMG_8493_640x427.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Nathan in Liberia""/></p>
<p>It is our goal, our mission, to save these young men. With your help, they can be rescued from the streets, and rehabilitated, through art.  </p>
<p>Painting unlocks their creative intelligence and is the best way for us to better understand what they've experienced. Imagine what their art could reveal about life and the strength of the human spirit! Painting will bring peace and hope to former child soldiers and the money raised will enable more boys to begin healing through art. </p>

<p>After all the rejection they've faced, this is our opportunity to accept them and support them in creating something that is truly valuable. This may be their only opportunity to express themselves appropriately and begin mending the emotional and psychological damage that has been done.</p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $25,000 so we can help more boys abandon their addictions, learn life skills, and heal from their experiences though art. When boys are rescued from the streets, they come to us bruised, scarred, abandoned, neglected, and suffering from addictions. After six months of rehabilitation, they are drug free and have learned to work together. The program gives them the skills necessary to create a normal life for themselves, their families, and the country of Liberia. </p>
<p>The money raised will go directly to providing the former child soldiers clothing, food, shelter, and rehabilitation. These boys are taught to work together, solve problems, speak French, drive automobiles, and heal from the horror they have experienced. The art they create in this program will help them heal, and will also give them a positive creative outlet. </p>

<p>By supporting our cause, you create peace, peace for former child soldiers, women, children, and the country of Liberia. By rescuing the boys from the street, you are creating safety for women and children, and helping the entire country heal. </p>
<p>Backers of our cause have the opportunity to receive some amazing rewards. Some of the rewards include: pictures and stories of the boys, watercolor prints and original art created by the child soldiers, hand-beaded wooden bracelets, hand-carved wooden tribal masks, or even a trip with Sahbu.org to help build schools, collect the art, and rescue more boys. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are over 40,000 former child soldiers in Liberia. With your help, these boys will become responsible fathers, leaders, teachers, and business owners. Right now, thousands of boys are still homeless, living in cemetaries and abandoned buildings, without education or the even the skills necessary to have a normal life. By contributing, you help boys become men - honest, educated men, that want to help their country heal and progress.</p>

</div></div>","My Story
Portable Ensemble is a project for a residency at Proyecto ’ACE in Beunos Aires during June 2012. For the initial proposal, I wanted to engage the public with a set of portable chairs that could be arranged in a variety of locations. The chairs would be transported using a bicycle and a wagon.
To extend the project beyond its initial context, I am interested in making prints using the slats of the chairs. Each person who donates $60 or more to the project will have his or her name carved into one of the seat slats. In exchange, that person will receive a limited edition woodblock print.


The Impact
Through this project, I want to look at the viability of making art during a time of widespread economic recessions and disparities. By allowing people to receive a work via donation, I want to have a more direct connection with my audience. The base donation of $60 roughly covers the cost of making and sending someone a print. So, in order to make the project vital, I need people to sponsor it, not only due to the costs, but so that I have a subject to work with.What I Need & What You Get


The approximate cost of making an edition of three prints is as follows: 

$5 for paper
$1 for ink
$5 for a mailing tube
$35 for postage to mail the print

 
The cost of using IndieGoGo is 4% of the donations if I meet my goal, and 9% if I don't. PayPal charges 3% for transaction fees, so I'm adding 12% to the initial cost of making each print, or roughly $50. 
I have to make sure to cover the cost of each print, as the cost of the residency is already high, and I am not eligible for federal and provincial grants in Canada as a full-time student. So, if there is money left over from each print, it will help cover the cost of the residency. But, I want to avoid using this as a platform to fund my trip, and keep the project focused on the value and viability of making art.Although I come from a background in sculpture, I am excited to have the opportunity to make prints. Carving a woodblock for a print has much of the same appeal as carving wood for a three-dimensional object, but with a two-dimensional result.

<h3></h3>
<h2><b>Why am I doing this?</b></h2>
<p><b>As a part of earning the rank of Eagle Scout, a Boy Scout must organize and complete an original public service project.</b> For several months I struggled to generate ideas. I considered installing benches, building shade structures, landscaping, etc., but I couldn't develop a single idea that I was truly passionate about...that is until now.</p>
<p>As a high school senior, I have been touring colleges nonstop for the past year or so, and I noticed that everyone rides a bike. The faculty have noticed that too. They have also noticed that bicycles break and that most people don't carry tools when they go for a ride. As a result, some universities have installed outdoor bicycle repair stations, providing otherwise helpless students with a handful of essential tools and a pump. </p>
<p>As a recreational cyclist, I have also noticed that the American River Parkway is an awesome place to ride. I eventually came to the conclusion that my project should in some way contribute to this wonderful trail that I too often take for granted. <b>My intention is to install three public bicycle repair stations in high traffic areas along the American River Parkway.</b></p>
<h2><b>What is a public bicycle repair station?</b></h2>
<p>As you might find in a bike shop, this is a stand on which you can place your bicycle in order to perform maintenance and make simple repairs. The only difference is that this stand is meant for public use.</p>
<p>The specific model stand I intend to install is called the Dero Fixit. Its design is simpler than many competitors and, as a result, it appears more durable. The stand itself consists of a vertical steel tube bolted to a concrete pad and two smaller tubes parallel to the ground mounted on top. A cyclist can hang his/her bike from the parallel tubes either by the saddle or the top tube. Several crescent wrenches, tire levers, screwdrivers, and allen keys hang from steel cables inside of the tube and are easily accessible to the user. A durable bicycle pump, compatible with both Presta and Schrader valves, is attached to the side of the stand.</p>
<h2><b>What can you do to help?</b></h2>
<p>As you might expect, these repair stations are not cheap. <b>Each stand costs $940 at minimum</b>, not including shipping, and I also need to pour concrete pads. I originally considered manufacturing the stands on my own, but I concluded that a prefabricated product was superior in terms of durability and product support.</p>
<p><b>At minimum I aim to raise $2000</b>. This will allow me to install two repair stations with basic air pumps. </p>
<p>For each additional $285, I can upgrade one of the pumps to a superior model, reducing maintenance costs and increasing the lifespan of the repair station.</p>
<p><b>Even if you are unable to contribute, you can help me by spreading the word.</b> Tell your family, friends, and fellow users of the American River Parkway. The more people we can get to donate, the more this project will benefit everyone on the bike trail.</p>
<h2><b>Details</b></h2>
<ul>
<li>I plan to install the stands in three high-traffic areas: the Guy West Bridge, William B. Pond, and Sunrise. I will need to pour concrete pads at the Guy West Bridge and William B. Pond. </li>
<li>The stands will be installed in highly visible areas, reducing the risk of vandalism.</li>
</ul>

The stands will be installed in highly visible areas, reducing the risk of vandalism.

from the mountains of rural northern Mexico and the Tarahumara Indians, to homeless
women and mothers at a Los Angeles transitional residence; and from an island
in Bahia, Brazil, that is the center of the African Diaspora for South America,
to the first HIV-AIDS clinic in Los Angeles County for Spanish-speaking
immigrants.</div><div>
<p>In all of my work<b> I use portraiture to illuminate the
spiritual essence of whomever I draw, paint, or photograph</b>; to truly view the eyes as windows into the soul. Time and again I've been blessed to see how the process affects those being portrayed. This holds most true, perhaps, with my <a href=""http://www.jmichaelwalker.com/#!bodies-mapping-time/x0ddr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bodies Mapping Time</a> project of nude photographic portraits of women, whose theme is ""A woman's body is a map of her life's journey."" I work collaboratively with each woman in finding the poses and, perhaps more importantly, in selecting the final images which will represent her. <b>Consistently, women who participate find the process self-empowering, and even transformative in how it affects their self-image and confidence.</b></p>

</div></div>","""The Healing Body Heals the Soul"" 


I’m J Michael Walker, a Los
Angeles-based visual artist, photographer and author. For over thirty years I’ve
crafted images honoring marginalized people and women, particularly women of
color, in works that come from my life experiences and friendships, and speak to the core of my being as a person and artist.My life and art have led me to create,
from the mountains of rural northern Mexico and the Tarahumara Indians, to homeless
women and mothers at a Los Angeles transitional residence; and from an island
in Bahia, Brazil, that is the center of the African Diaspora for South America,
to the first HIV-AIDS clinic in Los Angeles County for Spanish-speaking
immigrants.
In all of my work I use portraiture to illuminate the
spiritual essence of whomever I draw, paint, or photograph; to truly view the eyes as windows into the soul. Time and again I've been blessed to see how the process affects those being portrayed. This holds most true, perhaps, with my Bodies Mapping Time project of nude photographic portraits of women, whose theme is ""A woman's body is a map of her life's journey."" I work collaboratively with each woman in finding the poses and, perhaps more importantly, in selecting the final images which will represent her. Consistently, women who participate find the process self-empowering, and even transformative in how it affects their self-image and confidence.



And now South Africa calls: The small non-profit ArtAIDSArt organization has invited me to come work with and portray
the women it serves at their community center near Cape Town, South Africa – Women impacted by poverty and patriarchy, racism and sexism, and the threats of gender-based violence and HIV-AIDS.


The statistics are extraordinary: South Africa has
one of the world’s highest incidents of HIV-AIDS infection – perhaps 18% of the
adult population – and possibly the highest rate of gender-based violence (45% of women in the Western Cape). Both of these burdens fall
overwhelmingly on the backs of black women and mothers residing in the nation's townships. 

I'm  reaching out in hopes you'll support this project of art, exchange, and change. My first week in South Africa, I will spend time at the eKhaya eKasi community center that ArtAIDSArt operates near Cape Town - to break bread and sit with the women, to listen, to learn, and build trust.

Over the next three weeks, I'll work individually with each woman, in the studio that
ArtAIDSArt provides me, on the west side of Cape Town. I'll prepare some tea for us to share over conversation, then we'll work collaboratively, artist and model, in a protected environment, to capture the spiritual essence residing in each of these resilient
women. Equally important, each woman will have a voice in selecting the images that best represent her.



I hope to learn the stories and create meaningful portraits of the women of the township, and find inspiration for future paintings
and drawings; also I'm committed to pay each woman a living wage for the time she works with me, plus a percentage of any future sales of her image in my art. 


ArtAIDSArt hopes to see healing, self-awareness, and self-confidence flourish among the women who participate, and to draw attention to the important work they undertake in Khayelitsha township, 
But, in this society where
women’s power is unacknowledged and their bodies are devalued; where women bear
most of the burden and all of the blame and shame for HIV-AIDS - even though it is overwhelmingly
passed onto them from male partners/attackers - our deepest goal is that the brave process of posing
for portraits that honor women, in a supportive atmosphere, and of truly BEING SEEN, will further along each woman’s healing, self-empowerment
and self-knowledge, permitting them, in Yoliswa’s poignant words, “to see our
bodies, to know our bodies, to respect our bodies.”

Thank you for your support!  Ubuntu.
   

What I Need for this Project & What You'll Get:
My goal is to raise $3000 for this
project. 
While ArtAIDSArt, on their
shoestring budget, is providing me a studio and place to stay for the 4 weeks
I’ll be in Cape Town (Estimated value $2500+), I’m responsible for all other
costs, including: 
Roundtrip airfare between Los
Angeles and Cape Town; all my meals for four weeks
(August 7 – September 4); local travel and transportation inside South Africa; my art
materials, photographic supplies, etc.; and daily incidentals (local SIM card,
etc).
Additionally, and importantly, I
will be paying each of the women for their time, their taxi fares to and from
my studio, and providing them a meal on the days we work together.

The Impact We Can Make with This Project:


As my friend who works with my sponsoring ArtAIDSArt organization told me, “A
black woman in South Africa is not taught to see our bodies, to know our
bodies, to respect our bodies.” This deficit of vision, knowledge, and
empowerment is part of the trauma sustained through centuries of colonialism,
apartheid, and patriarchal inequality, and the related ongoing challenges of
gender-based violence and HIV-AIDS. 
This is what
ArtAIDSArt addresses in its community work with the women of Khayelitsha

loving, powerful portraits of them, so that they may see themselves afresh –
radiant in their power, strength, and beauty – as they continue to grow and
heal, past these traumas and challenges, into self-empowered and self-confident
leaders of their community. 
I have
exhibited widely, with over 100 group exhibitions in galleries and museums in
the United States and South Korea; and over a dozen solo shows in galleries and
museums in Mexico and the United States. I have fulfilled more than a dozen
public art commissions, grants, fellowships, and artist residencies in the
United States and Brazil. And my work can be found in a number of public
institutions in the United States, Mexico, and Senegal. I am the published

installation with an inverted fire box suspended in a pagoda-like steel
structure, surrounded by a halo of fire dishes. More than 45’ across and 18’
high, the entire piece will create the most mysterious cuddle puddle on the Playa!  Comfortably holding 50 of your fellow Burners, this is a space for people to
gather and participate with the extraordinary beauty of inverted fire.  It takes the scientific principle of inverted fire, where you are capturing
fire that wants to rise.  The fire cannot rise so it must reach, deep
down, for its fuel.  It has to go down and get oxygen and as soon as it
does, it heats up again and rises.  In doing so, it creates this
mesmerizing, caramel, silk sheathed, aurora borealis experience that just is
extraordinary.Something of this size is not created by one person and requires the continued encouragement and support from the larger community. Fortunately our local community has provided an immensely diverse network of people with a wide array of helpful skills, from metal fabricators and architects, to digital experts and a handful of awesome people just excited to get to their hands dirty and help however they can.  We’ve been fortunate to find this great group of people who take joy from contributing to bring this gift to the playa.

<h3><span>POPCAP</span></h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.popcap.cc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">POPCAP</a> is the international prize for contemporary African photography that is awarded annually to photographers whose work is either created on the African continent or deals with a diaspora of an African country.</p>
<h3>RECAP POPCAP - The Anniversary Book</h3>
<p>To celebrate POPCAP’s <a href=""http://www.popcap.cc/popcap-16en#about-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fifth anniversary</a> we will be collating <b>the 25 winning <a href=""http://www.popcap.cc/popcap-16en#winners-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">photographic series of the last five years</a> in the book RECAP POPCAP</b>, and personalities from the African photography scene will discuss the present situation in their field. The content of the book will be translated into five languages.</p>
<p>Each copy of <b>RECAP POPCAP</b> will be handcrafted, the <a href=""http://www.popcap.cc/popcap-16en#previous-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">exhibition banners</a> of years past incorporated into the covers of the books. This way each book will become a <b>unique</b> specimen that will carry with it the soul of the images and exhibition sites of the past five years.</p>
<h3>YOUR SUPPORT</h3>
<p>We need your help <b>now </b>in order to be able to complete these unique, hand-bound pieces! Our <a href=""http://www.recap-popcap.cc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">crowdfunding campaign</a> will go <b>until 31st May</b>. With your help we can reach this goal. We require not just <b>your financial support</b>, but also your <b>engagement as an ambassador for RECAP POPCAP</b>.</p>
<p>Let’s work together to promote a contemporary image of Africa.</p>

<h3><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">What we do</b></h3>
<p>In 2012 Benjamin Füglister brought the <a href=""http://www.popcap.cc/popcap-16en#prize-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">POPCAP prize</a> to life in order to offer a platform for contemporary African photography. Since then POPCAP <a href=""http://www.popcap.cc/popcap-16en#winners-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">winners</a> have been selected annually by an <a href=""http://www.popcap.cc/popcap-16en#the-judges-2016"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">international panel of judges</a>. What began with 160 submissions has grown in a mere five years into a project with 900 applications from 94 different countries and around ten exhibitions annually.</p>
<p>Every year the POPCAP team organises a <a href=""http://www.imageafrique.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">series of exhibitions</a> that take place in public spaces all over the world. This means that the presented photographs and stories reach a lot more people, and visitors are able to build their own image of the many and varied faces of Africa.</p>
<p>Further information about POPCAP can be found on our website <a href=""http://www.popcap.cc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.popcap.cc</a>.</p>

Together with you we wish to recap the events of the last five years and make them available to future generations.

</div><div>
<p>2012 hat Benjamin Füglister den <a href=""http://www.popcap.cc/popcap-16en#prize-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">POPCAP-Preis</a> ins Leben gerufen, um zeitgenössischer afrikanischer Fotografie eine Plattform zu bieten. Seitdem kürt jährlich eine
<a href=""http://www.popcap.cc/popcap-16en#the-judges-2016"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">internationale Jury</a> fünf <a href=""http://www.popcap.cc/popcap-16en#winners-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gewinnerinnen und Gewinner</a> mit dem <a href=""http://www.popcap.cc/popcap-16en#prize-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">POPCAP-Preis</a>. Was mit 160 Einsendungen begann, ist in nur fünf Jahren zu einem Projekt mit
900 Bewerbungen aus 94 Ländern und mit rund zehn Ausstellungen weltweit herangewachsen.</p>
<p>Jedes Jahr wird von einem kleinen Team eine <a href=""http://www.imageafrique.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Reihe von Ausstellungen</a> rund um den Globus organisiert,
die im öffentlichen Raum stattfinden. So kommt eine möglichst große
Öffentlichkeit mit den prämierten Fotografien und den Geschichten in Berührung und jede und
jeder kann sich sein eigenes Bild über die vielseitigen Gesichter Afrikas machen.</p>

die Nachwelt zugänglich machen. Das Buch wird fünfsprachig (Englisch, Französisch, Portugiesisch, Arabisch und Deutsch) verfasst und beinhaltet Arbeiten folgender Künstlerinnen und Künstler:</p>

POPCAP is the international prize for contemporary African photography that is awarded annually to photographers whose work is either created on the African continent or deals with a diaspora of an African country.
RECAP POPCAP - The Anniversary Book
To celebrate POPCAP’s fifth anniversary we will be collating the 25 winning photographic series of the last five years in the book RECAP POPCAP, and personalities from the African photography scene will discuss the present situation in their field. The content of the book will be translated into five languages.
Each copy of RECAP POPCAP will be handcrafted, the exhibition banners of years past incorporated into the covers of the books. This way each book will become a unique specimen that will carry with it the soul of the images and exhibition sites of the past five years.
YOUR SUPPORT
We need your help now in order to be able to complete these unique, hand-bound pieces! Our crowdfunding campaign will go until 31st May. With your help we can reach this goal. We require not just your financial support, but also your engagement as an ambassador for RECAP POPCAP.
Let’s work together to promote a contemporary image of Africa.
TOWARD A MORE CONTEMPORARY VIEW OF AFRICA!
--------------------------------------------
Would you like to know more?
What we do
In 2012 Benjamin Füglister brought the POPCAP prize to life in order to offer a platform for contemporary African photography. Since then POPCAP winners have been selected annually by an international panel of judges. What began with 160 submissions has grown in a mere five years into a project with 900 applications from 94 different countries and around ten exhibitions annually.
Every year the POPCAP team organises a series of exhibitions that take place in public spaces all over the world. This means that the presented photographs and stories reach a lot more people, and visitors are able to build their own image of the many and varied faces of Africa.
Further information about POPCAP can be found on our website www.popcap.cc.
Why another book?
For POPCAP’s fifth anniversary we will be publishing a book that shows a cross-section of the most recent developments in the pulsing, international world of African photography. Together with you we wish to recap the events of the last five years and make them available to future generations. The book will be translated into five languages (English, French, Portuguese, Arabic and German) and will contain works from the following artists:
Julia Runge, Nicolas Henry, Jason Larkin, Sabelo Mlangeni, Thom Pierce, Filipe Branquinho, Zed Nelson, Tahir Carl Karmali, Zied Ben Romdhane, Romaric Tisserand, Joana Choumali, Anoek Steketee, Eefje Blankevoort, Patrick Willocq, Léonard Pongo, Ilan Godfrey, Graeme Williams, Cristina de Middel, Alexia Webster, David Rengel, Álvaro Laiz, Dillon Marsh, Namsa Leuba, Adolphus Opara, Guillaume Bonn, Nabil Boutros, Paolo Patrizi
How much do we need and what will we use it for?
In order to publish the book as planned we require a total of $46,000. We will use this money to cover the following costs:



--------------------------------------------
What you will receive as thanks for your support
We have thought up some unique and lasting perks to say thank you for your support:
\\\\\ As a RECAP POPCAP supporter donating $9 you will receive a digital duck face of a POPCAP artist. We were able to acquire some of the award-winning POPCAP photographers in order to create a duck face series which we are only on offer during this crowdfunding campaign.
\\\\\ As thanks for a donation over $70 you will receive an original signed duckface polaroid from one of the award-winning artists.
\\\\\ You also have the opportunity the get a bag or deckchair produced using original POPCAP exhibition banners.
The winning works of the POPCAP competition are exhibited every year on large-format banners in public spaces in places such as Nigeria, Cape Verde Islands, and Switzerland. After their round-the-world trip these banners are then processed into bags and deckchairs.




\\\\\ We are maintaining the principle of down-cycling for the RECAP POPCAP book. Every copy of the book will be hand-bound and will incorporate the works of the last five years into the cover. Immerse yourself in the recent happenings within the world of contemporary African photography. We want to review the works of the last few years and complement these works with texts from notable authors. In this way we will recap and acknowledge the recent artistic achievements that have occurred on and with the African continent.

Whether you walk through the world with one of our bags or prefer to relax on one of our comfortable deckchairs - perhaps while reading the RECAP POPCAP book - every piece is chic, useful, durable and above all unique!
Each of these perks is a unique item and carries with it the soul of exhibitions past. By purchasing one of these unique items you will become a part of our project and help to make RECAP POPCAP a reality!
\\\\\ There is an exhibition catalogue for every year of POPCAP that presents the winning works of that year and introduces the artists. For $48 you will receive the exhibition catalogues from the years 2013 to 2016.


\\\\\ POPCAP '16 prize winner Julia Runge offers 3 copies of her photobook ""Basterland"" about the Baster people in Namibia. Get your own special copy signed by the artist with a personal dedication. More information about Julia's work www.juliarunge.com.



\\\\\ Every year a series of limited-edition, signed prints are compiled from the POPCAP winning works for EDITION POPCAP. For $490 we will send you the signed print of your choice.  
You can choose your print from our selection here.


\\\\\ Would you like to meet one of the POPCAP winners in person and get in front of their camera? Here you have the chance to partake in an exclusive photoshoot and have your portrait taken by an outstanding photographer. Treat yourself to this unforgettable experience and gift yourself or someone close to you a special picture of you.
Portrait shoots are possible in the following cities: Cape Town, Brussels, Abidjan, Maputo, Johannesburg and Lagos.


\\\\\ During a three-day stay in Basel you can take a look behind the scenes of POPCAP and the Image Afrique exhibition. We would love to have you there with us at the release of RECAP POPCAP and to be able to give you the opportunity to meet the outstanding photographers in person. You would be living centrally located so that you would be within walking distance of all of the sights, museums, exciting bars and restaurants, as well as shopping districts and of course the beautiful banks of the Rhine river.


\\\\\ If you are feeling particularly curious, then perhaps a one-week trip to the LagosPhoto Festival in Nigeria is for you. During one week you will have the opportunity to discover young artists, new photography and the city of Lagos. This prize includes seven nights in a double bedroom in a luxury hotel in Lagos. What a unique experience to attend one of the most important photographic festivals on the African continent!


\\\\\ For $9.000 you will become an exclusive RECAP POPCAP PATRON! The first page of the book will be dedicated to you and you will also receive a signed copy of RECAP POPCAP as well as a signed POPCAP EDITION print. You will also receive an invitation to the book preview in Basel where you will have the opportunity to meet this year’s POPCAP winners.


--------------------------------------------
Your support arrives
In autumn 2016 we will introduce RECAP POPCAP to the public. In order to commence production of the book, we need your involvement now. Our crowdfunding campaign goes until 31st May!
In this way we can...



begin production of RECAP POPCAP just before the crowdfunding campaign ends.


develop the book more extensively and exclusively depending on the support we receive.


gradually pay the wages of all those involved in the project (tailors, bookbinders, designers etc). All those involved are passionate about their work and their involvement should be acknowledged accordingly.


Should we exceed our target amount, the surplus funds will be put back into POPCAP to go toward the promotion of African photography.



--------------------------------------------
Share your enthusiasm
On the one hand we require financial support, but beyond that we wish to network the photographers and ourselves with as many interesting people as possible, so that we can further pursue longterm goals. It’s important that contemporary African photography receives the attention it deserves and that we can offer the artists and their artwork a long-lasting platform.
So please like, share and link our appeal. Talk to your coworkers, parents, grandparents, cousins, siblings, aunties and uncles about supporting this unique and beautiful book. RECAP POPCAP is unique international!

Because photography is a means of expression that is understood worldwide

Willst Du mehr wissen?

Was wir machen

2012 hat Benjamin Füglister den POPCAP-Preis ins Leben gerufen, um zeitgenössischer afrikanischer Fotografie eine Plattform zu bieten. Seitdem kürt jährlich eine
internationale Jury fünf Gewinnerinnen und Gewinner mit dem POPCAP-Preis. Was mit 160 Einsendungen begann, ist in nur fünf Jahren zu einem Projekt mit
900 Bewerbungen aus 94 Ländern und mit rund zehn Ausstellungen weltweit herangewachsen.
Jedes Jahr wird von einem kleinen Team eine Reihe von Ausstellungen rund um den Globus organisiert,
die im öffentlichen Raum stattfinden. So kommt eine möglichst große
Öffentlichkeit mit den prämierten Fotografien und den Geschichten in Berührung und jede und
jeder kann sich sein eigenes Bild über die vielseitigen Gesichter Afrikas machen.
Weitere Informationen zu POPCAP findest du auf unserer Webseite www.popcap.cc.
Warum ein Buch
Zum
fünfjährigen Jubiläum werden wir mit RECAP POPCAP ein Buch veröffentlichen, das
einen Querschnitt durch die jüngsten Entwicklungen des pulsierenden
internationalen Schaffens in der afrikanischen Fotografie zeigt. Zusammen mit Dir werden wir im Buch das Geschehen seit 2012 rekapitulieren und für
die Nachwelt zugänglich machen. Das Buch wird fünfsprachig (Englisch, Französisch, Portugiesisch, Arabisch und Deutsch) verfasst und beinhaltet Arbeiten folgender Künstlerinnen und Künstler:

Julia Runge, Nicolas Henry, Jason Larkin, Sabelo Mlangeni, Thom Pierce, Filipe Branquinho, Zed Nelson, Tahir Carl Karmali, Zied Ben Romdhane, Romaric Tisserand, Joana Choumali, Anoek Steketee, Eefje Blankevoort, Patrick Willocq, Léonard Pongo, Ilan Godfrey, Graeme Williams, Cristina de Middel, Alexia Webster, David Rengel, Álvaro Laiz, Dillon Marsh, Namsa Leuba, Adolphus Opara, Guillaume Bonn, Nabil Boutros, Paolo Patrizi

-Audiences will be able to attend a premiere screening of the poetry films in Coventry; we would also like to tour them across the UK once the project has been completed. There will also be perks - little ways of saying thank you to everyone who chips-in a little bit of money here and there!

Who?

Disappear Here is a project created  by Adam Steiner, an artist who co-founded the Coventry-based not-for-profit publisher, Silhouette Press and Here Comes Everyone magazine, as well as holding various literary events across Coventry, including the Fire & Dust poetry open-mics at The Big Comfy Bookshop (Fargo).
Adam was also involved in delivering a Big Lottery - Awards For All project - to improve access to creative writing and publishing skills with hard-to-reach citizens in Coventry.
Adam will manage Disappear Here and be responsible for working alongside the artists and citizens involved to make the project happen.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>As a Savannah College of Art and Design Masters of Arts Administration degree candidate, I chose to create an event (as my final project) to showcase the exemplary artistic talent that exists in East Tennessee. This segment of the population is often forgotten or lost to the rest of the world. That, however, hasn’t hindered the folks in rural Appalachia from finding their voice through the creation of art. Many have chosen to express their hardships and rich culture through painting, sculpture, photography, and jewelry construction. Often though, they haven’t been provided an outlet to display, discuss, or sell their works.  That is why this exhibition is so significant. This event will give these artists a chance to shine in their own community as many of them, for the first time, will see their works displayed throughout the venue.</p>
<p>Schedule and Location: The event is being held at 506 Buchannan Street in Erwin, Tennessee on February 25th and 26th. Doors will open at 7pm on February 25th and again on February 26th at 11:00am. Please visit the event’s Facebook page for more information. It can be found at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/appalachianartsevent"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/appalachianartsevent</a>.</p>
<p>Need:  The estimated cost of holding this event is $1,665. This includes the cost of the venue and installation materials. I am asking for your support in the amount of $800.00 to ensure the initial costs of the exhibition are met. My hope is that additional funds will be raised through sponsorships and art sales (via 80/20 commission agreement) to offset further expenditures.</p>

<h3>The story: If nothing else, please learn from mine.</h3>
On 3/6/2013 I left work later than usual... worked a little overtime becuase I was feeling really excited about some of my projects and wanted to get a head start. I missed my commuter bus because I left work too late... forcing me to take the 38L line which takes a bit longer (I didn't think anything of this because it's normal for me to take that line home). That night, I was attacked on the bus. I was sitting down in the back of the bus during regular commute hours.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I always keep my phone in my pocket when on the bus because I've known several people to get their wallets, phones, iPads stolen. Some attacks are violent, some aren't. Mine was.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had my purse in my lap as I pulled my phone outta my pocket to change the song I was listening to when someone hit me and grabbed my things (purse &amp; phone). They weren't alone. There were 5 people total who were part of this. They protected the attacker as they jetted off the bus. Instinctually, I ran after them. There was a struggle for my purse, which I got back. One of the group ran off with my phone as I grabbed one of them &amp; yelled at him (that's the only real weapon I had, my words). In that moment, I chose to let him go - I chose not to let it go any further. I didn't want to get into more of a situation than I was already in. I had the most important piece of all of this still with me - myself. I also had my purse which I got back in the struggle.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I called 911 from a nearby store. They let me use their land line for as long as I needed, I even used one of their iPhones to remotely lock and wipe my phone clean of all of my personal information. I used the Find iPhone app - which is automatically on all 4s and 5 phones. When the police came...he said that he takes reports of this type of violence at least twice a day. And what can they do: nothing. NOTHING.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>I did get hurt in all of this - which is part of why I am so tramatized. I also am not a violent person AT ALL - I hate that, seemingly, the only way to protect yourself during a situation like that is to become more violent. And if you're wondering if anyone helped me...during the attack, no one helped me.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, I've decided...I WANT TO TAKE MY TRANSPORTATION INTO MY OWN HANDS:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>and also: </div>
<ul>
<li>I want to give back to places that work toward making the world less violent. (see how I will below)</li>
<li>I'm terrifyied by being on the bus now. Currently, 'm suffering from some PTSD &amp; nightmares from this.</li>
<li>I want to start protecting myself.</li>
<li>I know this fear will fade, but I want to empower myself in a different way.</li>
<li>The violence on the bus is getting worse and the MTA isn't doing anything about it. The police can't help either.</li>
<li>I don't want to drive my car in the city - I'd like to get a scooter that gets me around quickly to my responsibilities and meetings - and safely.</li>
<li>You will help me continue to do the work that I do for others - I volunteer over 20 hours a week to the San Francisco Etsy community. I need the flexiblity that quick transportation - but I don't want to take the bus any longer.</li>
</ul>

</div>
<div>
<h3>Where will this money go?</h3>
<p>Once I've reached $3K goal - this is where they money will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, flowers sent to the store in Union Square that helped me when I felt like I was all alone.</li>
<li>One scooter - likely a 50cc becuase I don't need anything powerful or need/want to be on the freeway on my scooter. But I will get a license if needed. I WILL NOT BE BUYING A NEW ONE - I will be buying a used scooter.</li>
<li>Helmet for extra brain safety</li>
<li>Protective Jacket &amp; gear.</li>
<li>Weather-proof cover for my scooter</li>
<li>pepper spray for future safety</li>
<li>Lessons how how to properly ride my new wheels</li>
<li>registration for my new vehicle</li>
<li>Shipping for all of the items sold through this campaign.</li>
<li>ALL of the rest of the money will be donated to the V-Day charity which protects women in over 81 other countries.</li>
<li>if I don't reach my entire goal...I will be putting whatever I make into a safe place so that I can save for the rest of it on my own. You will still receive your artwork. I will be grateful for even just a $5 donation.</li>
<li>PLUS, you will know that I'm riding around with a HUGE smile on my face with the wind in my hair + you can take rides on the back, too!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What do you get?</h3>
<p>You get what you pay for - artwork by me + shipping is included!! All of these things are things I normally would sell...but I'm trying to raise money QUICK so that i can get on my own scooter wheels around SF quickly (before my 33rd birthday on May 2nd)</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can’t contribute and that's OK! I know you all care so much about me and my safety. Here's other ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please, get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
<li>PLEASE TELL PEOPLE WAYS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lastly - IMPORTANT</h3>
<p>I'm not one to get scared or think that i need to change my own lifestyle in order to protect myself - I'm pretty tough. But in this case...I want to get on the road to a better, safer life for myself quickly (Like ASAP). And the only way to do that is with help from those around me. I work hard as an artist - and I will work TRIPLE time to get all your artwork to those who support me.</p>
<p>Side note: THANK YOU for taking the time to even read this. It is taking everything inside me to even ask for any help at all. I just can't raise this money on my own as quickly as I can do it with your help. I'm being brave in this moment - I'm reaching out to the community that I know loves me so much and wants to see me safe and sound.</p>

<p>Here is my story. I was born in Montreal, Canada. From the age of 12 I knew that wanted to be actor. That I wanted to play.</p>
<p>Life brought me elsewhere, from paperboy to buss-boy, from packer in a grocery store to flight attendant, then graphic designer.</p>
<p>At 30 I realized that I was unhappy. That I had to change my life. That I had to do what I had always dreamed of: acting.</p>
<p>So I left my job as a graphic designer to start a new life. I used all my savings to pay for my training in the private sector. I followed more than 1500 hours of acting-on-camera workshops.</p>
<p>I quickly began to work. In advertising, television and then in cinema.</p>
<p>I have thus been able to earn my life humbly for the last 10 years. I got several parts, I won the best actor award in 2011 at the International Fantasia Festival. I realized my dream to a certain extent.</p>
<p>However, the industry is difficult in Quebec. Productions are becoming rarer, auditions are less frequent. I have seen many of my colleagues drop out of the trade to do something else.</p>
<p>I do not want to give up. I want to continue doing the most amazing job in the world and the next step is the United States.</p>
<p>I want to raise funds to hire a lawyer to help me get my O-1B visa.</p>
<p>We have a lot of talent in Quebec. I think of the directors Jean-Marc Vallée, Denis Villeneuve and Xavier Dolan who make our cinema radiate all over the world. I want to be part of it. I dream big. I want to make it happen.</p>

So I left my job as a graphic designer to start a new life. I used all my savings to pay for my training in the private sector. I followed more than 1500 hours of acting-on-camera workshops.
I quickly began to work. In advertising, television and then in cinema.
I have thus been able to earn my life humbly for the last 10 years. I got several parts, I won the best actor award in 2011 at the International Fantasia Festival. I realized my dream to a certain extent.
However, the industry is difficult in Quebec. Productions are becoming rarer, auditions are less frequent. I have seen many of my colleagues drop out of the trade to do something else.
I do not want to give up. I want to continue doing the most amazing job in the world and the next step is the United States.
I want to raise funds to hire a lawyer to help me get my O-1B visa.
We have a lot of talent in Quebec. I think of the directors Jean-Marc Vallée, Denis Villeneuve and Xavier Dolan who make our cinema radiate all over the world. I want to be part of it. I dream big. I want to make it happen.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>To have this type of experience with friends and colleagues is a critical component of contemporary design education.</strong> In 2012, David Grey, the Chair of the Graphic Design Department at Santa Fe University of Art and Design, organized and lead a 23 day contemplative travel adventure and mindfulness retreat through the Mexican landscapes of Chiapas and the Yucatan Peninsula. With him were six of his strongest graphic design students. Known as Hexagano, these students came from Mexico to study in the US and for two years they warmly embraced the principles of contemplative design. As a result, they were now given the opportunity go back to Mexico with their professor and their expanded perspective and travel through indigenous regions where they've never been. Their intention was to explore a foreign space with the eyes of a contemplative graphic designer and allow this wakefulness and curiosity to fuel a series of graphic design and contemplative art exercises. As a tribe of nomadic designers, they would explore and watch and participate and appreciate. Afterward, they would return to the University and design a contemplative, expressive, design-based, image-making book, called <em>The Importance Of...</em> as a visual response to the entire experience and in essence create a vehicle to share the perspective and fruition of a contemplative graphic designer. </p>

<p><strong>And now, here’s a bit from the book’s introduction essay explaining what it means to approach Graphic Design as Contemplative Art….</strong></p>
<p>“...The sensibility of a mystic is nurtured by exploring graphic design as contemplative art. This practice expands space and provides support for designers to genuinely see the external phenomenal world and its interconnectedness to our thoughts and agendas, our hopes and fears. We break down boundaries of language and culture by connecting one’s primordial wisdom to the essence of design elements and principles, and by doing so, we are able to recognize that the manifestation of one’s creative path is the direct reflection of the mind’s view. Graphic design becomes much more than just an application of visual communication. It becomes a way of seeing. It becomes a way of appreciating. It becomes a way of being. Because of this, we can use the practice of graphic design as a method to develop purer perception. It can help wake us up. Design students observe this unfolding experience while visually and conceptually connecting and separating everything from distilled ideas to extended narratives. By regularly revisiting the question, “What is the criteria for critique?” my students are asked to look closely at how their internal storylines interweave with those of our ever-changing society. These storylines grow in richness and clarity when appreciating the prism of our environment, the wisdom of localized culture, and the energy of a connected community. By taking the time to look inward before projecting outward, students are able to develop a sense of awareness that transforms the conceptual design process into an exploration of freedom. </p>
<p>This is nothing new. It could be considered by some as a return to the spirituality of the Bauhaus or the wakefulness of Black Mountain…. As pedagogical support, students are introduced to breathing meditation. By following one’s breath and observing one’s thoughts, a person begins to settle the mind and synchronize body. Through this practice of mindfulness, one is able to profoundly connect with the spaciousness of intuition and the pointedness of intellect. Discerning awareness and skillful means work in harmony, bringing about a sense of joy while cultivating a sense of taste. When exploring this in the studio, students begin to feel the effects of a settled group creative consciousness. Contemplation, gestation, and creation occur with a greater sense of ease. Community begins to magnetize….” </p>

Our programs are developed for the general public and have special appeal to those interested in art, design, architecture, history, preservation, urban and community planning and development.
Our largest program is the Art Deco Weekend (ADW) Festival. This year is our 38th Anniversary. ADW was started to bring attention to the beautiful Art Deco architecture along Ocean Drive. MDPL provides educational lectures, tours, films, and other programming during ADW to educate people about the Art Deco Historic District, History of Miami Beach, Culture of Miami Beach, and more. With over 300,000 people in attendance and over 85 events, ADW is the largest and longest running festival in Miami Beach, FL.The Impact
This campaign will help us provide free events to the community during Art Deco Weekend as we have done for 38 years. For the 38th Anniversary, we want to make this festival better than ever and we need your help!Along with government and community advocacy, MDPL has made Miami Beach synonymous with education, art and culture. The annual Art Deco Weekend (ADW) draws 300,000 to South Florida every January. MDPL exhibits, lecture and film series, historic tours and education have become regular daily, weekly and seasonal events all year long, mainstays of the global draw Miami Beach boasts. 
What We Need & What You Get
 
Our goal is $20,000. This money will help pay for the educational components of Art Deco Weekend festival, our ongoing advocacy efforts, our annual programming and assist with upcoming exhibits for our new Art Deco Museum.

</h3>Do you love The Colbert Report? Were you devastated when you found out that it was ending soon? Yeah...us too!<br/><br/>We are a group of fans who want to give The Colbert Report staff and crew an amazing send off. If you watch the show regularly you know that the Colbert Nation has always been an active part of the show. So we want to say a huge 'thank you' to Stephen Colbert and everyone involved in the writing and production of the show by creating and gifting 100 custom medals to The Colbert Report in time for the last episode of the show in mid December. The Colbert Report has just under 100 staff and crew.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>So far we have sourced several quotes from medal-makers around the USA for 100 antique gold-colored medals (2.5"" in diameter) with red, white and blue ribbons. The production, shipping and tax costs for 100 custom medals will be approximately $550. <br/></p>
<p>If you donate $100 or more to this project, you will receive your own custom medal as a souvenir! If you donate $50 you will receive a 'Thank You' postcard featuring the final medal design, and will be entered into a lottery to receive any unclaimed medals from the higher perk level.<br/></p>
<p> Extra money raised by this project (up to a total budget of $1000) will go into purchasing larger, better quality medals for the staff and crew, as well as an engraved crystal trophy for Stephen Colbert. If we raise $700 we will upgrade the medals to 3"" versions. If we raise $1000, we will add the crystal trophy to the order. <br/></p>
<p>The crystal trophy will be similar to the one previously gifted to the show by the Colbert Nation for its 5th Anniversary:<br/></p>

The designer of the medal will receive a medal shipped to their door in thanks.<br/><br/>The Colbert Nation Medal Campaign requires a minimum of $550 and will end when it reaches $1000, so get in quickly to be one of the lucky contributors to Colbert Report history!<br/><br/><b>Update: We're over 70% of the way there with less than 24 hours to go!

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>I am Inky (In Kyung Lee), a video and dance artist from South Korea who is currently based in US. I’ve been a traveler my whole life. I was in the air flying from US to Korea in my mother’s womb, and grew up having countless memories of flying, moving, and travelling.</p>
<p>Being abroad and away from home, I used to associate airplanes with flying home. Flying somewhere has always been loaded with emotions and expectations. As the time of being abroad extended, I began to question the definition of home. I realized that home is not a static location, but rather more about people and memories. I could make anywhere my home if I decided to (or did I learn how not to make anywhere home for my convenience?). Slowly, my sense of “being home”, “going home”, or “missing home” blurred. From this place, I furthered my inquiry to true and false nature of my personal memories and history. Are all my memories truthful “fact” or do I make them up and mold them depending on necessities and wishes? What kind of memories makes a regular place special, and how do those memories form? Are they “real?”</p>
<p>Based on these thoughts and inquiries, I plan to produce a video art as I travel through Europe (Portugal – Lisbon &amp; Tondela, Switzerland - Geneva, and Germany – Berlin &amp; Stolzenhagen) to Canada (Vancouver &amp; Montreal), back to the States (Phoenix, AZ). Each of these places has its distinct and strong association with my ideas and memories of home. Throughout the 4 months of summer traveling, I will observe and interact with the people, surroundings, nature, atmosphere, sounds, smells, etc. in each location. I will also focus on filming whenever I am in transit, such as in airports, trains, and buses. I will connect these observations with my realization and analysis of what makes a place “home”, how the memories link from a place to another, and how much of those are factual and/or fabricated in my mind.</p>
<p>In addition to travelling, I will immerse myself into environments that bring out most artistic potential in me. In Portugal, I am participating in an artist residency program. Korean Embassy in Portugal agreed to promote my artistic research while I produce work there, and I am communicating with Korean Embassies in my other destinations. In Germany, I am attending a month long movement workshop with world-renowned guest artists and a small group of international participants. In Canada, I will present my work in World Dance Alliance 2013 Conference, and meet various artists from around the world. These activities help me to stay active as an artist by constantly being in contact with various artists and having mentors throughout my project. Upon my return to the States, I will polish the final video with advice of my mentors here.  </p>
<p>As an artist and individual, I find this project crucial at this stage of my life. I see the potential of it clarifying my path and life so far, therefore guiding me to the next step. However, as an artist and an international student who cannot work (it is illegal) or take out loans, I would not be able to make this trip possible at all without your kind help. This is my big exciting dream at this point, and I humbly ask you to partake in the process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>In order for this trip to happen, I will majorly need help with airfare, other transportation costs, housing, and food. For transportation, I see it being around $3000. Housing and food I am unsure, but I anticipate it to be at least $3300 (if I do not sleep on the streets, train stations, and airports like I did last time!). Therefore, I set my goal for the funding to $6300. If I do not meet my goal for the funding, I will still use whatever amount I receive to make this trip happen in a modified way.</p>
<p>To express my sincere gratitude for your generosity, I will have some gifts for you, such as handwritten postcard, hand drawn &amp; written postcard, link to my final video, and “thank you” credit in my video. In the postcards, you can ask me specific questions if wanted. You can also ask questions that you want answers from a certain or random person/people I meet during the travel, and I will get answers for you.   </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>            If you cannot help in financial way, there are still ways that you can help. I would appreciate any kindness and hospitality throughout my journey, such as providing housing, food, and information about the cities. In addition, I am in a desperate need for a new video camera, because my camera is the most basic model that does not render professional quality video, and it has a very small memory. If any one has a decent video camera to donate or sell at a good price, I would be extremely grateful. Lastly, one of the biggest help will be sharing this campaign with your families and friends. Please help me spread the word and spread my wings to fly!</p>

<p> </p>
<p>프로젝트 요약:</p>
<p>저는 미디아 &amp; 댄스 아티스트로 현재 미국에서 활동 중인 이인경입니다. 살아가면서 저는 언제나 “여행자” 였습니다. 엄마 뱃속에서부터 저는 미국에서 한국으로 날아갔고, 이렇게 자라면서 수도 없는 여행과 이사와 비행의 기억들을 가지게 됐습니다.</p>
<p>집을 떠나 외국 생활을 하면서, 저는 비행기를 볼 때마다 집으로 날아가는 상상을 하곤 했습니다. 어딘가 새로운 곳으로 가는 것은 언제나 저를 많은 감정들과 기대들로 가득 차게 했습니다. 외국 생활의 시간이 길어지면서 저는 집의 정의를 묻기 시작했고, 곧 집은 한정된 장소가 아니라 사람들과 기억들에 대한 것이라는 것을 깨달았습니다. 제가 원한다면 저는 어느 곳이든 저의 집으로 만들 수 있다는 것을 알게 됐습니다 (아니면 저의 편리함을 위해 그 어느 곳도 집으로 만들지 않는 방법을 배우게 된 걸 까요?). 점차, “집에 있는 것”, “집에 가는 것”, 또는 “집에 대한 그리움” 이란 감정들이 흐려지기 시작했습니다. 그러면서 개인적 추억들과 기억들의 진실성과 거짓성에 대한 질문들이 깊어져 갔습니다. 저의 모든 기억들이 진실된 “사실” 들일까요, 아니면 필요와 소망들에 의해서 만들어지고 바뀌어진 것들일까요? 어떠한 기억들이 평범한 장소를 특별하게 만들고, 어떻게 그러한 기억들이 만들어 지는 걸까요? 그 모든 기억들이 “진짜” 일까요?    </p>
<p>이 모든 생각들과 질문들을 기반으로, 저는 유럽과 캐나다를 거쳐 미국으로 돌아오는 과정을 통해 비디오 아트를 만들 계획 입니다 (일정: 포르투갈 – 리스본 &amp;  톤델라, 스위스 – 제네바, 독일 – 베를린 &amp; 스톨즌하겐, 캐나다 – 벤쿠버 &amp; 몬트리올, 미국 – 아리조나). 이 모든 장소들은 집에 연관된 저의 생각과 기억들과 각각 특별한 연관성을 가지고 있습니다. 4 개월간의 여행을 거치며, 각각의 장소에서 사람들, 그 주변 환경, 자연, 분위기, 소리, 냄새, 등등을 관찰 할 것 입니다. 또한, 비행기, 기차, 버스 등 “중간 지점”에 있을 때에 촬영을 하는 것에도 초점을 둘 것입니다. 이 모든 관찰들을 무엇이 장소를 “집”으로 만드는가에 대한 깨달음과 분석에 연결 시키고, 어떻게 한 장소에서 다른 장소로 기억들이 이어지는지, 그리고 얼마나 그러한 기억들과 연결점들이 사실인지 나의 머릿속에서 만들어진 것들인지 자세히 연구 할 것 입니다.</p>
<p>여행을 하는 것에 더해서, 저는 저의 예술적 잠재력을 최대한 불러 일으 킬 수 있는 환경들에 저 자신을 포함 시킬 것 입니다. 포르투갈에서 여러 분야의 예술가들을 초대하여 창조와 협동의 장소를 마련 해 주는 아티스트 레지던시 프로그램에 참여 할 것입니다. 포르투갈에 있는 한국 대사관이 그곳에서 저의 연구를 홍보 해 주기로 했고, 다른 목적지들에 있는 한국 대사관들과도 연락을 하고 있는 과정에 있습니다. 독일에서는 세계적으로 유명한 예술가들을 초청해 전세계 각지에서 초대된 소그룹의 예술가들을 대상으로 진행되는 한달 동안의 워크샵에 참여 할 수 있게 되었습니다. 캐나다에서는 전세계의 다양한 예술가들이 모이는 월드 댄스 얼라이언스 (세계 무용 협회) 2013학회에서 저의 연구를 발표 합니다. 이 모든 활동들은 저를 예술가로서 깨어있을 뿐만 아니라 저의 프로젝트를 돕는 멘토들을 만나는데 큰 도움이 될 것 입니다. 여행을 마치고 미국에 돌아와서는 이곳에서 관계를 쌓아 온 멘토들의 도움을 통해 저의 최종 비디오를 끝마칠 계획 입니다.</p>
<p>예술가로써, 그리고 한 사람으로써, 저는 이 프로젝트가 현재 저의 삶에 매우 중요하다고 생각합니다. 지금까지 저의 삶을 돌아보고, 정리하고, 다음 단계로 이끌어 줄 수 있는 큰 잠재력이 있는 프로젝트 입니다. 하지만 타지에서 일을 해서 돈을 벌 수 도 빚도 낼 수 없는 국제학생과 예술인으로써, 여러분의 친절한 도움이 없이 저는 이 프로젝트를 성공적으로 해 낼 수 없습니다. 이 프로젝트는 현재 저의 가장 크고 기대되는 꿈 중 하나 이기에 여러분들께 이 과정에 함께 참여해 달라고 겸손히 여쭙니다.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> 도움이 필요한 부분:</p>
<p>이 프로젝트를 성공적으로 마치기 위해서는 비행기, 다른 교통수단, 숙박, 그리고 식비에서 주로 도움이 필요 할 것입니다. 교통비는 적어도 $3000, 숙박비는 적어도 $3300 으로 예상합니다 (저번처럼 길거리와 기차역에서 밤에 떠돌지 않는 이상!). 이 금액은 여러가지 다른 필요한 것들을 제외한 기본 금액으로,저의 캠페인 목표를 $6300으로 잡았고, 전 금액이 모아지지 않는다고 해도 저는 5월 초에 첫 목적지로 떠나서 변형된 방법들과 한정된 제정으로 어떻게든 여행을 끝마칠 생각 입니다. (하지만 저는 여전히 저의 사랑하는 가족과 친구들의 도움과 사랑을 매우 믿음직 스러운 동반자로 생각합니다!)</p>
<p>도움을 주신 분들께 감사를 표현하기 위해서 여러가지 작은 선물들을 준비했습니다. 여행을 하며 보내 드릴 손수 작성한 엽서, 손수 만들고 작성한 엽서, 저의 최종 비디오 링크, 그리고 비디오 마지막에 “감사한 이들” 로 이름을 올려 드릴 겁니다. 원하신다면 엽서에 특별한 질문들을 하셔도 좋고, 제가 여행을 하면서 만나는 다른 이들에게 있는 질문을 주셔도 좋습니다.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>도움을 주실 수 있는 다른 방법들:</p>
<p>제정적으로 도움을 주실 수 없는 분들은 다른 방법으로도 도움을 주실 수 있습니다! 저의 여행 기간 중의 크고 작은 모든 따듯한 친절함들은 저에게 큰 의미가 있을 것 입니다. 지낼 곳을 제공해 주시든, 음식을 주시든, 도시에 대해서 정보를 주시든, 따듯한 격려 한 마디를 해 주시든, 모든 도움들이 저에게 정말 크게 다가옵니다. 또한, 저는 현재 절박하게 새로운 비디오 카메라가 필요 합니다. 왜냐하면, 제가 가지고 있는 카메라는 가장 기본 모형의 캠코더라서 메모리도 매우 작지만 전문적인 화질을 창출 해 낼 수가 없습니다. 사용하지 않는 괜찮은 비디오 카메라를 기부하시거나 싼 값에 파시길 원하시는 분이 계시면 정말 감사할 것 입니다. 마지막으로, 이 캠페인을 가족과 친구들에게 퍼뜨리는 것을 도와주시는 게 가장 큰 도움 중 하나가 될 것입니다. 저의 날개를 펼칠 수 있도록 소식을 퍼뜨려 주세요!  </p>
<p>“콘센트, 화장실 수도꼭지, 쨈 통, 또는 공항의 표지판이 그 디자이너가 의도한 것보다 더 많은 것을 우리에게 말해 줄 수 있다; 그것들을 만든 나라들에 대해서 말해 줄 수 있다.”</p>

집을 떠나 외국 생활을 하면서, 저는 비행기를 볼 때마다 집으로 날아가는 상상을 하곤 했습니다. 어딘가 새로운 곳으로 가는 것은 언제나 저를 많은 감정들과 기대들로 가득 차게 했습니다. 외국 생활의 시간이 길어지면서 저는 집의 정의를 묻기 시작했고, 곧 집은 한정된 장소가 아니라 사람들과 기억들에 대한 것이라는 것을 깨달았습니다. 제가 원한다면 저는 어느 곳이든 저의 집으로 만들 수 있다는 것을 알게 됐습니다 (아니면 저의 편리함을 위해 그 어느 곳도 집으로 만들지 않는 방법을 배우게 된 걸 까요?). 점차, “집에 있는 것”, “집에 가는 것”, 또는 “집에 대한 그리움” 이란 감정들이 흐려지기 시작했습니다. 그러면서 개인적 추억들과 기억들의 진실성과 거짓성에 대한 질문들이 깊어져 갔습니다. 저의 모든 기억들이 진실된 “사실” 들일까요, 아니면 필요와 소망들에 의해서 만들어지고 바뀌어진 것들일까요? 어떠한 기억들이 평범한 장소를 특별하게 만들고, 어떻게 그러한 기억들이 만들어 지는 걸까요? 그 모든 기억들이 “진짜” 일까요?    
이 모든 생각들과 질문들을 기반으로, 저는 유럽과 캐나다를 거쳐 미국으로 돌아오는 과정을 통해 비디오 아트를 만들 계획 입니다 (일정: 포르투갈 – 리스본 &  톤델라, 스위스 – 제네바, 독일 – 베를린 & 스톨즌하겐, 캐나다 – 벤쿠버 & 몬트리올, 미국 – 아리조나). 이 모든 장소들은 집에 연관된 저의 생각과 기억들과 각각 특별한 연관성을 가지고 있습니다. 4 개월간의 여행을 거치며, 각각의 장소에서 사람들, 그 주변 환경, 자연, 분위기, 소리, 냄새, 등등을 관찰 할 것 입니다. 또한, 비행기, 기차, 버스 등 “중간 지점”에 있을 때에 촬영을 하는 것에도 초점을 둘 것입니다. 이 모든 관찰들을 무엇이 장소를 “집”으로 만드는가에 대한 깨달음과 분석에 연결 시키고, 어떻게 한 장소에서 다른 장소로 기억들이 이어지는지, 그리고 얼마나 그러한 기억들과 연결점들이 사실인지 나의 머릿속에서 만들어진 것들인지 자세히 연구 할 것 입니다.
여행을 하는 것에 더해서, 저는 저의 예술적 잠재력을 최대한 불러 일으 킬 수 있는 환경들에 저 자신을 포함 시킬 것 입니다. 포르투갈에서 여러 분야의 예술가들을 초대하여 창조와 협동의 장소를 마련 해 주는 아티스트 레지던시 프로그램에 참여 할 것입니다. 포르투갈에 있는 한국 대사관이 그곳에서 저의 연구를 홍보 해 주기로 했고, 다른 목적지들에 있는 한국 대사관들과도 연락을 하고 있는 과정에 있습니다. 독일에서는 세계적으로 유명한 예술가들을 초청해 전세계 각지에서 초대된 소그룹의 예술가들을 대상으로 진행되는 한달 동안의 워크샵에 참여 할 수 있게 되었습니다. 캐나다에서는 전세계의 다양한 예술가들이 모이는 월드 댄스 얼라이언스 (세계 무용 협회) 2013학회에서 저의 연구를 발표 합니다. 이 모든 활동들은 저를 예술가로서 깨어있을 뿐만 아니라 저의 프로젝트를 돕는 멘토들을 만나는데 큰 도움이 될 것 입니다. 여행을 마치고 미국에 돌아와서는 이곳에서 관계를 쌓아 온 멘토들의 도움을 통해 저의 최종 비디오를 끝마칠 계획 입니다.
예술가로써, 그리고 한 사람으로써, 저는 이 프로젝트가 현재 저의 삶에 매우 중요하다고 생각합니다. 지금까지 저의 삶을 돌아보고, 정리하고, 다음 단계로 이끌어 줄 수 있는 큰 잠재력이 있는 프로젝트 입니다. 하지만 타지에서 일을 해서 돈을 벌 수 도 빚도 낼 수 없는 국제학생과 예술인으로써, 여러분의 친절한 도움이 없이 저는 이 프로젝트를 성공적으로 해 낼 수 없습니다. 이 프로젝트는 현재 저의 가장 크고 기대되는 꿈 중 하나 이기에 여러분들께 이 과정에 함께 참여해 달라고 겸손히 여쭙니다.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a project of the heart out of pure love for Leo &amp; Mo, our two seahorses. We are seeking funding for their care and preservation.</p>
<p>Why Leo &amp; Mo? Leo stands for Leopold and Mo for Mozart. These names were given to them by a guest during one of the marvelous weddings held at Schloss Leopoldskron. The names simply stuck.</p>
<p>Ok, now some fun facts:</p>
<ul><li>Leo &amp; Mo were created by their father, theater impresario Max Reinhardt. For those who don't know him, he was an incredible actor and director - perhaps the most famous of the Roaring 1920s. Max not only brought Schloss Leopoldskron back to life with lavish renovations and outstanding artwork, but also made the Schloss a center of inspiring celebrations, enchanting theater performances, and legendary parties (you should have seen Marlene Dietrich sing in the Great Hall!).</li></ul>
<ul><li>Max created Leo &amp; Mo by collaborating with a local craftsman from Salzburg. </li></ul>
<ul><li>The seahorses are almost 100 years old.</li></ul>

<br/>Why do we need you?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>It's pretty simple: with a great Schloss comes great responsibility and maintaining a masterpiece isn’t cheap. We'd like your help with one of the property's most beautiful details, Leo &amp; Mo.</p>
<p>With the generosity of donors funding the renovation of our discus throwers, we are seeking to give Leo &amp; Mo the same attention. From their iconic presence in <i>The Sound of Music </i>to their quiet grandeur today, a gift from you would ensure their legacy, indeed even their survival.</p>
<p>You can help to end their state of deterioration today and make them fit for the next 100 years by donating $10, $50, $100 or more - every Dollar, Euro, Yen or Pound helps!</p>

This is a project of the heart out of pure love for Leo & Mo, our two seahorses. We are seeking funding for their care and preservation.
Why Leo & Mo? Leo stands for Leopold and Mo for Mozart. These names were given to them by a guest during one of the marvelous weddings held at Schloss Leopoldskron. The names simply stuck.
Ok, now some fun facts:
Leo & Mo were created by their father, theater impresario Max Reinhardt. For those who don't know him, he was an incredible actor and director - perhaps the most famous of the Roaring 1920s. Max not only brought Schloss Leopoldskron back to life with lavish renovations and outstanding artwork, but also made the Schloss a center of inspiring celebrations, enchanting theater performances, and legendary parties (you should have seen Marlene Dietrich sing in the Great Hall!).
Max created Leo & Mo by collaborating with a local craftsman from Salzburg. 
The seahorses are almost 100 years old.

Leo & Mo have been guarding the lakeside entrance of the Schloss ever since Max’s tenure. They have observed more happy couples getting married than any other seahorses in the world.
Remember the scene when Maria and the children fall out of the boat and into the lake? If you haven't already watched the video above, you should probably do it right now (no worries, we'll wait...). 



Why do we need you?
 
It's pretty simple: with a great Schloss comes great responsibility and maintaining a masterpiece isn’t cheap. We'd like your help with one of the property's most beautiful details, Leo & Mo.
With the generosity of donors funding the renovation of our discus throwers, we are seeking to give Leo & Mo the same attention. From their iconic presence in The Sound of Music to their quiet grandeur today, a gift from you would ensure their legacy, indeed even their survival.
You can help to end their state of deterioration today and make them fit for the next 100 years by donating $10, $50, $100 or more - every Dollar, Euro, Yen or Pound helps!
 
 


How is it done?
 
A team of specialists will repair and restore the seahorses to their original splendor.
Sand blasting provides the most effective method of cleaning their delicate surfaces without the use of chemicals or risk of damage. Years of atmospheric carbon and grime build-up will be ""blasted"" away. 

Why the Seahorses?
So why the heck are we collecting money for two geriatric seahorses, rather than the really important stuff, like fixing the roof of the Schloss or renovating paintings? Well, there are two simple and honest reasons:

I have always dreamed of sharing my poetry and was about to chicken out (once again) from a great opportunity...until that kick in the pants comment.  Now, I'm going after and checking off some pretty cool items on my buck list: 
Perform poetry in front of actual people
Compete for and win a spot on Detroit's poetry slam team (bonus: become Detroit's 2015 Grand Slam Champion)

Compete in the 2016 Women of the World Poetry Slam
Compete in the 2016 Individual World Poetry Slam

WHAT'S SLAM POETRY (and why do I need to raise money)?  
Slam poetry is competitive performance poetry that allows individuals and/or teams to share their writing in a creative, yet  powerful way.
National competitions have several costs associated with them, especially if a person competes individually and with a team...which I will be doing both:  As a team member of Detroit's 2015 Poetry Slam Team, I am responsible for raising money toward our $5,000 fundraising goal to participate in the 2015 National Poetry Slam.  As an individual, I'm fundraising to ensure my participation in two national competitions next year, the 2016 Women of the World Poetry Slam and 2016 Individual World Poetry Slam.
I've set my fundraising goal at $2,500.00.  Take a gander at my costs for just this year's national slam competition:





Hotel 


$150 per night @6 nights


$750




Flight


DTW to OAK


$557




Registration


$575 per team


$115




Subtotal




$1422







WHAT AM I POLITELY ASKING FOR?

A donation of any amount.  Any donation(s) you provide will be greatly appreciated and go directly toward costs associated with my participation in the 2015 National Poetry Slam (NPS), the 2016 Women of the World Poetry Slam, and the 2016 Individual World Poetry Slam.

A couple questions that may be on your mind:



How will I divide funds among the competitions?  1/3 of monies raised will go toward covering costs for the National Poetry Slam (NPS) competition.  The rest of the money will go toward  the 2016 Women of the World and Individual World Poetry Slams.

if I exceed my goal of $2,500?  Yippee!  First, I'll do a happy dance at turbo speed!  Then, I'll donate those additional funds to the annual Kids-TALK Poetry Slam.  The slam provides a safe space and outlet for youth to speak out for those affected by trauma.
