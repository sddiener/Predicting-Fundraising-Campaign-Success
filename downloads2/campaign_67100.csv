<p>Hi IndieGoGo, we're Andrew Heine and Tony Collins, and we're here to fund low-cost, custom nightlights.</p>
<p>Lighting seems so simple, but whether you're reading at night or walking in the hallway, there never seems to be the perfect set up to help you see what you're doing. That's why we've created lightbox. It can go anywhere, and has multiple options for how it stays on.</p>
<p><strong>What it is</strong></p>
<p>Each light comes with an on/off switch for the LED, and your choice of LED and sensor. The LED options are a 28,500mcd white light for lighting an entire room, and a 5,000mcd red light for keeping night vision. Each of them is diffused to spread light throughout the room. The sensors are an additional way to turn the LED on. The sound sensor responds to noises about as loud as a clap, and the motions sensor works from 3 meters away. Each sensor lights the LED for 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>We need your help</strong></p>
<p>By using simple technology, we've been able to keep our prices low for timers, however, we still need more funding to try out better and cheaper sensors. With your help, we can make a beautiful, functional, and cheap lighting solution for anywhere in your home.</p></div>","The Basics

<p>You might even say that it's a movement! Every you look, people are reading on a device. In cafes, on hammocks, on the subway, even by the sea. Kindles, iPads, Nooks, E-Readers of all stripes are everywhere.</p>
<p>One day, while doing my business and enjoying my Kindle edition of the NY Times, I set my e-reader on the edge of the bathtub and it nearly fell in. This near miss made me realize that I wanted my device to have its own safe spot in my favorite reading spot. So I borrowed my daughter's sewing machine and, several iterations later, came up with the John-E-Reader: a handcrafted e-reader bathroom storage solution. I gave a few early prototypes available to my in-laws for Christmas. I'm pretty sure they were ""delighted"".</p>
<p>I want to make the John-E-Reader in two colors - navy blue and white. There’s two sizes. “Standard” ($23) and “Jumbo” ($27) . Standard works with everything up to 5 and a half inches wide. The jumbo is great for the iPad or other larger tablets.</p>

<p><strong>Some FAQs</strong></p>
<p><em>Hey Chad. This thing seems really easy to make, why should I buy one from you? </em></p>
<p>Your right, it doesn't take Project Runway sewing skills to put together a John-E-Reader.  I borrowed my daughter's sewing machine to make a small batch (including the ones shown here) as Christmas gifts for my in-laws. Also, if you don't have access to a laser cutter, then you can just use a bit of string or ribbon to attach it to the TP bar. If your bathroom is really manly, you can make your own out of leather. To save you the trouble of all those pesky measurements, I'm offering downloadable instructions and plans at the $9 level (for personal use only!). </p>
<p><em>Why $2070? That seems like a pretty random goal.  </em></p>
<p>Thanks for asking and I'm glad you noticed! That takes me to 90 regular size John-E-Readers. That's a threshold for me that makes it a production run worth it. I'll use the money to pay for materials, some sewing help, and, of course, laser cutting the acrylic handles. </p>
<p><em>How come just two colors? Would you consider adding more materials? Like, how about terrycloth?</em></p>
<p>If this project attracts a lot of support, I'm totally open to adding more material choices as stretch goals. But I think its a bit premature to be talking about stretch goals. Terrycloth is certainly a comfy suggestion!</p>
<p><em>So, do you have a background in textile production, design, or fashion? </em></p>
<p>Um, no. My background is in broadcast journalism and video production, but I really enjoy the satisfaction of making tangible things and also happen to be a <a href=""http://www.google.com/patents/USD623241"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">patent-holding</a> inventor.  I have a bunch of fun ideas and hope that this can be the first of many crowdsource-financed projects for me. </p></div>","The E-Reading / Mobile / Tablet Revolution has Gone to the Toilet

One day, he came upon a magical treasure bowl by accident. Ever since then, he has became one of the richest man in China.....


 

 
INTRODUCING HERB & RICH CONNECT.Inspired by the “Treasure Bowl” tale and with the integration of smart technology, “Herb & Rich” is a fun LED lighting, planting and coin-saving system that is specifically designed to bring you joy and fortune.With a metallic lamp base, ""treasure bowl""-like piggy bank at the bottom and bonsai at the top as well as round design that reflects Taichi in the Chinese culture, “Herb & Rich“ is USB-powered and comes with a smart iOS/Android app for you to control the lighting while having fun with its coin-activated fortune cookie game.The touch-triggered LED light provides your plants the light they need while illuminating gold glow inside the treasure bowl when a coin is deposited in the bowl.“Herb & Rich“ is the perfect combination of ancient wisdom and modern technology. Whether you are using it as a Feng-Shiu deco at home, a lucky adornment in the office or a fun tips- collector at the counter of your store, it is definitely going to strike up some conversations. The Design of “Circle” The idea of “Taichi Circle/Cycle” is crucial in Chinese culture. It symbolizes an ecosystem and a sense of completeness, harmony, satisfaction as well as perfection. The concept of everything comes into to a full circle also resonates the philosophy of “what goes around, comes around.”With that in mind, the “Herb & Rich” design embodies “circle” in every possible way. Whether it’s the round treasure bowl or the curvy, arc-shaped aluminum lamp tube, they all mean to bring harmonic balance, fullness and fortune to the household.The aesthetically pleasing, intriguing and modern design totally compliments your modern lifestyle while its perfect size is also great for being an unique deco both at home and in the office. USB InputCombining modern technology, “Herb & Rich“ has a Micro-USB port and can be powered with any USB connectors. Plants & Smart-Controlled LED Lights- Bringing Green to Your EnvironmentLiving in an urban jungle, we all need a little green in our lives from time to time. Green plants do not only provide you with freshener air but also are great for your eyes after a long day at work. Yet, with our busy schedule, sometimes it is just a bit difficult for us to keep track of the beloved greens around us.With “Herb & Rich,” you are able to turn on/off the LED light, set the timer and adjust its brightness in the palms of your hand via our carefully-designed app on your bluetooth-enabled smart phones (iOS and Android compatible). The smart control features allow you to make sure your plants obtain all the light they need to grow and flourish indoor as if they were in an outdoor setting.The best thing is, if you own both the ""Herb & Rich"" and ""Herb & Fish,"" you are also able to control both of them right on your phone. You can sync up to 5 devices with your smart phone.The greener the environment, the more calm and zen your will feel. Treasure-Bowl Piggy Bank With Digital Fortune Cookies— Teaching Your Children Good Saving HabitsIt’s important for us as parents to teach our children how to save money and encourage them to form good money habits at young age. Most children will take these habits into adulthood and they can subsequently affect their financial decisions for the rest of their lives. As a responsible parent, money education is something we cannot ignore and by turning it into something fun yet educational is definitely beneficial for our kids in the long run. This, is where “Herb & Rich” comes in. Tip box“Herb & Rich” is not your regular piggy bank. By inserting the coins, the sensor on the opening slot would send a signal to our cleverly-designed app and a fortune cookie will pop up on your app screen with the well-wished fortunetelling of the day. It is the perfect ice-breaker and tips-collector for your store. HOW IT WORKSHerb&Rich is easy to use and control by a smartphone (iOS/Android supported).Connect:
Base on Bluetooth 4.0 LE  
Install ARKY HOME APP  
Activate the Bluetooth in your smatphone (no need pairing)  
Activate ARKY HOME APP  
Search and connect via the APP 
Control:

</div></div>","CEWi is the door to a new dimension of smart homes. Easily control every appliance in your home from anywhere anytime. Make your life easier. Because it’s fun to have a smart home. Especially if it’s part of a smart world. Imagine a world with no limits, where everything is in your hands and you can control them anywhere, anytime. That’s not just a dream. We could make it a reality, but to do that, we need your help.Why is CEWi different from all the other smart home systems?Developers of other, existing smart home systems attempt to achieve their goal by designing their own devices to go with their solution, ranging from smart garage doors to light bulbs or motorized drapes. They remain the only source of gadgets compatible with their system. This limits the range of available devices and prohibits their makers from lowering their prices.Our philosophy is different. Our vision is to create a platform that can be used universally. CEWi is a platform that can be used by anyone who wants to develop a smart device. This way, anything can become online in an easy and low-cost way. Anything can become part of a huge ecosystem. In the long run, we'd like as many manufacturers to use CEWi as a platform as possible.The user benefits from the CEWi platform as well. They can use same app to pre-heat their oven on the way home that they've just used to switch off the lights at work.

You can turn everything around your home smart in a few minutes, without the need for experts or renovation. The garage door, the sprinkler system and the coffee machine are remotely controllable just as easily as your alarm system or the lamp besides your bed. We provide you an easy solution to integrate your new and existing devices into the CEWi system.

Have you ever forgotten to switch off the lamp in the morning rush? Or forgot to set the timer of the washing machine? That’s not a problem anymore. Just grab your smartphone, log into our app, and do those things with just one tap. You can access your CEWi network from everywhere, because all data is stored in our safe cloud.Your system is always ready. With your preset schedules you can sit back and relax, CEWi does everything for you. Monitor your home anytime, even when you’re away. The possibilities are endless.Our multiplatform smartphone app
Our system is intelligent and extremely safe. You have the ability to precisely set user permissions to control each device. This way, you can set up parental controls to protect your children from messing with dangerous things around the house, or let your friends switch off the lights, but only if they’re in your living room. 
CEWi uses strong encryption so all your data and personal information is safe with us.

With CEWi and your devices you have endless oppportunities. It is up to you to discover all the ways you can benefit from CEWi.
To control everything, you need a remote control and a receiver. These are the central parts of our ecosystem. The remote is our free application on your smartphone, tablet or computer and the receiver is one of our products or just a circuit that manufacturers can easily build into their devices. And the bridge between these two parts is the CEWi cloud. That's our magic.

For BLÜME we believe those risks to be the following:</p><p><strong>1. Manufacturing challenges or delays</strong><br/>To mitigate delays we are targeting nearly a year to deliver BLÜME to ensure that final design tweaks, manufacturer selection, tooling, and initial quality control all occur with plenty of time to ship production-level BLÜME units.

In our case, BLÜME is the culmination of several key software solutions at once, including firmware code to run the device itself, mobile applications for both iOS and Android platforms, and back-end server code that will run in the cloud. The number of different languages and interfaces between components can increase development challenges.</p><p>To mitigate this risk we are taking several approaches. First, we have selected standardized development platforms such as iOS and Android, and have chosen a full-featured connected device platform.

So do we! It might come as a surprise that average dog leashes, especially retractable leashes have caused injury in some cases. How?

It might come as a surprise that average dog leashes, especially retractable leashes have caused injury in some cases. How? Well, the problem with regular leashes is that they are not very visible to those around you. In certain weather and lighting conditions, a regular long leash could become an unexpected tripwire. Action was taken in the past to make leashes safe. Manufacturers started adding reflective materials to leashes. This works to a certain degree, but only when light is shone directly onto it. Joggers, pedestrians, and cyclists don't usually carry around flashlights.  Here is where QimmiQ comes in. With our illuminated dog leash, you will be seen and stay out of harm's way.QimmiQ’s built-in illumination capabilities keep your dog's leash visible in any weather conditions, creating awareness of you and your dog. Anyone around you will see your leash, no matter how far out it is extended.You are now visible from short distance and long distance!Now that they will be able to notice you and your leash, accidents or injuries can be avoided.Our patent-pending technology combines the use of optical fibers and state-of-the-art LED technology which we have combined with clever mechanics within the leash itself to illuminate the extended leash with a simple push of a button.

The new approach is to eat with one hand only - using a fork to tear off a bite before spearing it. We all do it from time to time. Cutting food with an ordinary fork can be a tough task and unnecessarily agonizing. And eating, nested deeply in our sub conscious, is the most intimate and influential process for the human being. That's why it is of great importance that this process is facilitated as much as possible.

We are currently in the process of consolidating ourselves as one of the most socially impactful local companies, and we are looking for partners and partners who wish to join our end.
What We Need

We need  to finance some activities for creating a model of modular home.
The advantages of our construction system are:


Economic acquisition
Safe construction
Environmentally friendly

The Impact

The social impact is going to take place through the transformation of products and services that specifically leave poverty with a better quality of life, accessing the virtuous circle of opportunities for technological innovation, research and knowledge transfer.
Similarly, to the extent that the serial housing model increases along with the sustainability criteria used, it will have a positive impact on the socioeconomic indicators of the region in which the project will be used.

Risks & Challenges
In addition to the problems caused by the housing deficit, the consequences of which are the lack of development in the real estate sector and financing options, among other factors, many communities suffer the effects of a year of climate change that increased temperatures and decreased the frequency of rains. The sustainable housing project deals in an innovative way with various types of problems: the enormous housing deficit, the absence of social integration and a growing concern for the environment.
Sustainable housing can help mitigate those problems.
Other Ways You Can Help
The sustainable housing project we are proposing will be very viable, however, there could be difficulties among multiple stakeholders due to alliances and strategies for obtaining resources.

an alert to your phone when you’ve
got mail. It works from any distance - even if your post box is in another
country.

Get a notification each and every time you receive new mail
-  no matter the distance of your post box.
postybell’s amazing sensor detects new movements inside your postbox and sends
you a notification, so you don't waste any time checking empty boxes.
We are consuming knowledge at an
online pace, in every area of our lives. That is, almost every area. postybell
finally marches post mail (A.K.A snail mail) to the online era, informing you
when you receive letters or packages to your mailbox, wherever you are.

Now, we know attempts have been
made to create a device similar to postybell. Yet, they all relied on Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth technologies, alerting you ONLY if you were located within a short
distance from your mailbox. postybell eliminates the distance barrier, sending
you a real-time cellular alert, no matter where you are (even when you’re
abroad!). 
 HOW IT WORKS

modules:

However to make things even more

After some research I found out that the serial specification of this connector has been published on the web by the iRobot company. It is possible to read out all of the sensor data and control all of the actuators! How cool is that! I thought it would be cool to be able to control the Roomba on my smartphone or tablet. Unfortunately there are no Roomba Wi-Fi adapters for sale. So I decided to build one myself, and here it is.<br/><br/></p>

I think iRobot is the number one brand of robot vacuum cleaners available, they sold more than 5 million cleaning robots all over the world. 
 A while ago I discovered that iRobot had placed a mini-din connector behind a flap. After some research I found out that the serial specification of this connector has been published on the web by the iRobot company. It is possible to read out all of the sensor data and control all of the actuators! How cool is that! I thought it would be cool to be able to control the Roomba on my smartphone or tablet. Unfortunately there are no Roomba Wi-Fi adapters for sale. So I decided to build one myself, and here it is.
I have been getting a lot of mails of interested buyers, so that's why I want to start production of the module. This way developers all over the world can do cool things, more easily, with the iRobot. It is also great for novice users because the module is plug and play. That's where you guys come in, we want to produce a minimum of 100 modules to be able to provide them at a reasonable cost. If we are successful and you are a supporter we try to deliver the modules within 20 weeks. Please watch this movie to see how to connect and use the module:

Pixel Moose is a startup that aims to propose creative solutions for spatial optimisation. We thought of the problem of gift boxes and gift wrappings. How does one maintain the element of surprise of gifting so that the receiver does not know what he or she is receiving? Wrapping a gift up in multiple layers of paper and foam may solve this issue nicely but they give rise to the problem of wastage.
How then can we innovate on this traditional way of packaging a gift?
This is where the Moosebox comes in!
We think Moosebox could be the innovative solution, and with your support, we can make Moosebox a reality.  
Your contributions will allow us to turn Moosebox into a reality and enable the gifting community to have a greener and a more fun experience!

</h1><p><i>..because we love awesome technology...</i></p><h3><b>What is the Nabto-box? Pronounced (nab-toe)<br/></b></h3><p>The Nabto-box takes the ability of peer-to-peer technology (like Skype) and allows you to remotely connect anything from anywhere, yes you read that correctly - ANYWHERE! Also, the ability of VPN to create a virtual network cable spanning long distances across the Internet, mix and stir and put it in a box. Well, that is pretty much it in a nutshell.</p><p>Peer-to-peer technology makes it easy to setup the direct connection, VPN technology makes your PC, smartphone and tablet think they are connected to a remote network. Join the two, put it in a box and you will wield the same power as large scale VPN solutions for accessing company networks. The only difference is that instead of being an advanced and complicated solution it is a seamless and easy solution in a small box, just plug it into your home network and it will deliver remote access to your home network from anywhere.<br/></p><p><b>Always be connected to your home</b>.. Imagine you could establish a remote connection to your home network just as easy
 as you make a call on Skype or sending an email. One simple box located in your home connected to your network allows you to seamlessly create a remote connection and be connected to your home network with just one
 click.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/673773/files/20140625025927-connected-home.png?1403690367"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>Access anything connected</b>.. You can access, readout the status and control your networked thermostats, stream files from your PVR or media server, view the output of your surveillance cameras, 
alarm-system, get files from your NAS 
box or file-server, stop or start your lawn irrigation system, pool control system, even if the devices didn't have an remote connect option installed... the 
possibilities are endless.</p><p><br/></p><p>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/673711/files/20140625021614-nabtobox-rendered2b.png?1403687774"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                             The final product we are aiming at<br/>                                    (we are changing the power socket to USB)<br/><p><br/></p><p><b>Why Nabto-box?</b></p><p>Nabto-box is a retrofit solution for non-remote accessible networked Gizmos. A lot of Gizmos are born with network capabilities (like Ethernet or WIFI) and some newer Gizmos can also be reached remotely with the right remote access APP or software (which btw. is what we normally do), however the vast majority of Gizmos was only designed with local network access in mind, combined with cumbersome remote access. This is not a direct reflection of the vendor, it's because remote P2P access is hard to do.<br/></p><p><b>Increase value of your existing Gizmos</b><br/></p><p>The Nabto-box will extend the functionality and value of your existing networked Gizmos by making them reachable from anywhere, don't you think it is a cliché that you are able to reach out to most of the world via the Internet, but not be able to reach your own home?</p><b>Other usages - Be your own VPN service provider</b><br/>When you connect to the Nabtobox, all traffic will be directed to the box and onto your home network. Therefore if you are surfing the internet your public IP address will be the current IP address of your router.<br/>Occasionally internet services are bound only service customers to a specific IP range of specific geographic locations. Many streaming services for music and movies have only acquired the rights for the material for a certain geographic area. With a connection established to a Nabtobox on your home network to these services the IP address revealed will be the one from your home network.<br/><br/>  <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/638029/files/20140610024830-what-i.png?1402393710"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b><br/>Yes it can be done today; we just make it super easy...</b><br/>Have you ever tried to setup Internet based remote access for Gizmos placed on your home network? If you have you will know that this 
can be an awfully cumbersome, teeth grinding and nail-biting experience, in which you might end up with no result, 
but a lot of waste of your time and hair-loss from extensive pulling.<br/><br/><b>Nobody likes to read thick heavy manuals ...</b><br/><p>Setting up remote access involves reading 
heavy technical manuals on how to configure your router/firewall with stuff 
like Dynamical DNS, Port-forwarding, setting static IP addresses on your 
gizmo, or maybe creating a SSH-VPN tunnel etc. <br/></p><p><b>And sometimes it cannot be done... </b><br/>Or perhaps your Internet Service Provider doesn't even allow 
you to administer your own router and firewall then you are really stuck!</p><p>Here's some examples from the web (sounds easy?):<br/></p><p><a href=""http://www.pcworld.com/article/244314/how_to_forward_ports_on_your_router.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PC-world on how to setup portforwarding</a><br/></p><p><a href=""http://panasonic.net/pcc/support/netwkcam/technic/port_fwrd.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Panasonic on setting up your router for port forwarding</a><br/></p><p><a href=""http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/allow-remote-desktop-connections-from-outside-your-home-network"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Microsoft on setting up portforwarding to allow remote access to Desktop</a></p><p>Even if you successfully are able to get through all of the mumbo-jumbo firewall configuration and got it to work. Are you aware that you just created an open door for the whole internet to access  your Gizmo? A black-hat hacker or script-kiddie with a port scanner and knowledge of a security breach could break into your home and immediately your network is exposed.<br/></p><p>Now if you are an expert, coped with the firewall and you are even so smart that you setup some security measures (or so you think) and got it all right the Nabto-box can still be something for you. If we reach our goal the box not only delivers remote access to your home network, but also remote USB access and we even have an option with interfaces for the hardcore electronic geeks (UART and general I/O) for connecting other non-connected stuff (NB: both virtual P2P USB and UART &amp; I/O are stretch goals).</p><p><br/></p><h2>How and what do I need to do?<br/>
</h2><p>You of course need to get your hands on the box. Then, you will need to connect the power supply and connect the Ethernet port to your router. Voila now the box is on your local network - and after a short installation of software you can connect to it from anywhere.<br/></p><p><b>Let's take a peek at the steps involved - the software</b></p><p>You will need to configure the box when you are at home, so the box knows who you are and only letting you connect. This involves pairing your end-user device (PC or similar) and email with the box. <br/></p><p>This is the steps involved in getting the box up and running:</p><p>      </p><p>           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/676400/files/20140626032651-install.png?1403778411"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                  <br/><br/><p>Explained in more detail:<br/></p><ol>
<li>Install the client software on your PC. The software will automatically discover the box and the box will automatically be able to see that you are connecting from the same local network and will assign you administrator permissions by default. The unique box name (identity) will be remembered by the client software and pair your box and PC (the ID of the box is something like: 4e12.nabtobox.net and this will be remembered by the software)<br/>
</li>
<li>The software will ask you about your email account and a password - don't fret! Behind the scenes: a private and public key will be generated and the public-key is sent to a CA and a certificate will be issued to you with the assigned email you typed. The private key will be protected with the password.</li>
<li>Now go remote. Right click on the Nabto icon in your task-bar and click ""Connect home"" you will in matter of seconds be remote connected directly to your home network. What happens is that your operating system will detect a new virtual network interface installed by the software and all traffic on this network will be directed to the Nabto-box on your home network.<br/>

<br/><br/><br/><h1><b>Technology</b></h1><b>Why not start with our passion...<br/></b><p>The quick and dirty explanation of the concept for tech people: It's a Peer-to-peer VPN and port tunneling solution (which you probably already guessed).</p><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/638071/files/20140610030643-NVPN.png?1402394803"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>A more detailed explanation:</b><p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) interface is installed on your computer and a secure peer-to-peer connection is made from your computer to your Nabto-box on your home network. Your computer will be ""fooled"" into thinking it is directly attached to your home network and you can make the connections to your home Gizmos, as usual. You could also regard it as a very, very, VERY long network cable (just virtual) that is always connected from your computer to your home network.<br/></p><p>Another method is to tunnel the underlying protocol, normally TCP, which is a well-known approach used in solutions like SSH. A P2P (Peer-to-Peer) based TCP tunnel is created from the client-end-user-device to the Gizmo on your home network. This TCP tunnel is normally the port 80 of a Web-server interface. A ""channel"" to the port 80 of the Gizmo is opened on the end-user-device (a port) and when f.x. the browser is communicating with this ""channel"" it is fooled to believe it is communicating with the web-server on the Gizmo.   <br/></p><p>The protocol underneath the VPN is the same type of P2P technology that you experience every day in products like Skype. Basically you use a well-known rendezvous point (a server) on the Internet to get two devices to collaborate and create a direct connection between them. The rendezvous point is just a place to exchange Internet addresses and other information of how the two device can meet up.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/631645/files/20140607040912-3part.png?1402139352"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p>The rendezvous is done fairly quickly and will only transfer limited information between the parties to successfully create the final P2P channel. Once this P2P is established the rendezvous server is not needed and one server can hence be rendezvous point for multiple (not unlimited, but a fairly large number with at least 6 figures depending on the server hardware) clients and boxes.</p><p>You can read more about the basics of peer-to-peer connection establishment here:<br/></p><p><a href=""http://www.brynosaurus.com/pub/net/p2pnat/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.brynosaurus.com/pub/net/p2pnat/</a></p><p>Keep in mind.. our task is to hide all this and make it simple and secure for you. The NAT-traversal described in the above is quite simple; you are able to do different tricks to get a better results.<br/></p><p>Read more on the Nabto software here:<br/></p><a href=""http://nabto.com/#download-list"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>http://nabto.com/#download-list</a><br/><br/>Here you can also play around with the generic device software (Linux, Windows, and different embedded platforms). Notice, this is software for skilled embedded software engineers with an in depth understanding of software and Internet protocols:<br/><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b>What about security</b>?</p><p>If every person on the Internet was able to just create a P2P connection to your box, off course we solved nothing, we just made things worse. A two way authentication system is designed as part of the rendezvous connection protocol; this protocol is based on the same mechanisms inside of the well-known SSL (TLS) protocol. Public key infrastructure is used to establish authentication and establish symmetric keys (AES), which then are used to encrypt the P2P communication channel. <br/></p><p>Only authenticated persons will be able to make the remote connection once created, with the heavy encryption it will then be very secure.<br/></p><p><b>The specific ways to interface the remote connection<br/></b></p><p>There are 4 ways to interface the remote connection. Although it is possible with the hardware this is not all inclusive, if our goals are exceeded it will be included.<br/></p><p><br/></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Virtual network P2P access.</b> A virtual network interface will be created on your client device. When activated it will create a P2P communication channel with the Nabto-box and to your client device with the software running on it, it will resemble the client device connected to your home network. This is not always possible - it requires that the two networks are not in the same IP range to avoid conflict. When two Gizmos are assigned to the same IP address, the one on your home network and the other located on the network you are currently attached to, the software is unable to determine which Gizmo you actually want to talk to. Ways to circumvent this (disabling your local network traffic or advanced NAT techniques) exists, but this is definitely not for the first versions of the software. Another way to accomplish what you want is TCP port tunneling.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><b>TCP port tunneling.</b> A specific communication port on your Gizmo will be forwarded and bound to a port (normally the same) on your client device (PC, smartphone or tablet). When you
 access this port on your local client device a P2P connection will 
automatically be setup to your Gizmo forwarding all traffic back and 
forth.<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>Our long-term goals are identified with the remaining two ways:<br/></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Stretch goal 1: GPIO.</b> Since the NXP LPC1758 SoC (System on Chip) has many general purpose IO's and we want to make a PIN out header on the board and make software for easy accessing both digital and analog interfaces. By doing this, the box can be used to connect to all kinds of electronics and sensors. Here is an example of how you can connect a relay to PIN's on another board we have done: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_OOZYgIYHQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_OOZYgIYHQ</a><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Stretch goal 2: Virtual remote USB.</b> Since the NXP LPC1758 SoC is born with a USB OTG interface it could be possible to access non-connected 
gizmos via USB. Most SoC's are born with a USB interface, so if this options is included similar to the virtual network interface above, you will be able to remotely reach the USB interface via a virtual USB interface on your client device. The only requirement would be that the gizmo would have USB 
interface and you are then able to seamlessly remote access it from 
anywhere. Simply activate the virtual USB interface and tell it to connect to the USB interface on the Nabto-box. Your client device will think it is a local USB port. We have experienced issues with this. Combination of high latency connections (let's say across the Atlantic) and bad USB protocol designs can be a challenge (100ms latency combined with a one byte request/response protocol makes a 10 bytes/second transmission rate). This will only be available for Windows, Linux and Mac.<br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p><br/><p></p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Receive</h3> <p>We have a proof-of-concept prototype currently up and running, both hardware and software. In order to complete this and start production the time and cost to manage these tasks are needed.</p><p></p><p></p>Below, you will find a picture of a prototype of the enclosure of the final product. The box contains sockets for Ethernet, USB and Power sockets. However, on the final product we will do a row of holes with LED-light guides for colored LED's on the PCB that will indicate the status of the device.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/666121/files/20140622053902-prototypeprint.png?1403440742"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                              Makerbot print of early enclosure prototype <br/><br/><br/><h2><b>Specifications</b></h2><b>Software<br/></b>The base station is planned to run in Amazon EC2 services. Been there, done that. TCP tunneling is already part of the basic software. We have a prototype of a P2P-VPN solution, but it will need some adjustments and a lot of testing. Also we have a P2P virtual USB prototype solution,  but this will definitely require some work, why we also will do it as stretch goal. <br/><br/><b>PCB</b><br/>The board will be completed based upon an existing design, with a track record of years of proven stability and tolerance to heat, cold, moisture, and housewives banging with vacuum cleaners. The only portion that will be enhanced is the MCU, and the UART to RS485 level converters and RJ45 sockets (not the Ethernet) etc. will be dropped. It has to be a little more compact, but otherwise it is the same board. The USB socket and connection has to be enabled (you can spot the pin-outs just behind the black RJ45 on the right side). <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/674107/files/20140625064251-PCB.png?1403703771"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><b><br/>The SoC</b><br/>The SoC (system on chip) will be a LPC1758FBD80, ARM cortex M3, 100Mhz, 512kb flash, and 64kb of RAM. Ethernet and USB OTG. A SoC in a LFPQ casing that people (with a very steady hand and a lot of patience) are able to hand solder ""easily"" (as opposed to BGA). With more power for the purpose, a lot more than the current need. We have concluded it would be nice and could come in handy later and all while being cost efficient.<br/><br/>You could ask, why not WIFI? Well, for simplicity reasons and cost-efficiency. To plug a box into a home network (the router or similar) this is something everyone can do. The box doesn't need mobility, as long as it is on the network it doesn't matter where it is physically placed. Ghz signals are also as close to magic and wizardry as you can get (PCB wiring is not just ""wiring"" anymore in the Ghz spectrum, why we would like to stay in the Mhz spectrum).<br/><br/><b>The RTOS and device software</b><br/>The box will run FreeRTOS. This is a very small real time Operating System using very limited resources. The box could probably be done just running a simple scheduler loop, but having a RTOS is nice for all the reasons we currently don't know about. <br/><b><br/>Power supply</b><br/>Our standard supplier of (switching) power supplies needs a MOQ of 1000 pcs. If we cannot get to that, we'll find a replacement from a distributor. We started out with a 3.5x5.5mm power socket on the box. But due to request we are changing it to micro USB power in the process guessing its easier to come by and more standardized.<br/><br/><b>Plastic enclosure<br/></b>This is probably the largest pain. Doing plastic enclosures is difficult. To get the right quality, match the PCB, get the holes to match the sockets on the PCB, draft angles, and with just the right amount of spacing, not too much and not too little. We have experienced sub-suppliers who mirrored the 3D CAD drawings, supplying us with enclosures with everything right, in a mirrored <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg%C3%A4nger_%281969_film%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Doppelgänger world</a>, that is. The first prototype will be done on our own Makerbot Replicator 2, after 2-3 enclosures will be printed on a SLA  machine (or similar).<br/>If you own a 3D printer or have one available, you will be able to print the enclosures, in house. We will upload the drawings when finished.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/676122/files/20140626002042-both-CAD.png?1403767242"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                                              Enclosure done in FreeCAD<br/><br/><br/><h2>What is our plan?</h2><h2></h2><p>This is our plan:<br/></p><ul>
<li>The first early prototype PCB rolls of 10 pcs, will not be public. Hopefully will be right in first shot (since we are reusing an old design with modifications). But we plan a second test-roll and possible third (hope not). We will do this when the campaign is running.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Hardcore tech-backers - Alpha release:</b> First test production run will be 50 pcs available. We want to find people out there who can help test the boards but also test the first software shipments doing peer-to-peer transmissions and obtain results from various types of firewall and internet setups in conjunction with the board. We call this group ""Hardcore tech-backers"". This shipment will be the board alone with appropriate rubber/plastic spacers on the backside, i.e. low <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife_acceptance_factor"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WAF</a>. There will not be any fancy enclosures, but we will release the drawings (both the FreeCAD and STL) so the option to 3D print one would be available. The firmware would be an ALPHA firmware and only include basic functionality like the RTOS, IP stack and remote P2P TCP tunneling firmware when we ship it. But, it will be installed with a Ethernet based bootloader (our own TFTP based one) so you can upgrade it with the new versions of the firmware with any PC. New firmware versions would be continuously released. This initial batch is only for people with a fair amount of technical knowledge (and patience). All of the source code will be included together with instructions on how to compile, flash and debug if you choose to help us. In our software stack you would have the ability to (via the local network) get debug traces from the firmware. When in debugging mode the box will broadcasts all ""trace"" commands from the firmware (which can be gathered by special supplied software). Further, we have a plugin for <a href=""http://www.wireshark.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wireshark</a> so it is simple to follow the network transmissions.  The board will have a status of evaluation kit, so it will not be run through certifications (CE and etc.). To the hardcore techies, the board itself should be valuable as a way to play with FreeRTOS on an Internet connected and well-equipped board. Our goal is to have this completed and shipped by mid-September.<b><br/></b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Beta tester:</b> After the alpha tests, we will need a larger population of beta tester that actually test the board. This batch will be 250 pcs. It will include the first BETA of the production version of the firmware, which would be a more stable release and with more features implemented. This is a batch for people who are used to dealing with technology, but you don't need to be a hardcore C-programmer. At this stage the firmware should work and be error-free in most environments. The user tools would be packaged in neat applications (mostly error free), however we expect that you probably need to flash one or two new firmware versions to get full capabilities. This batch should be fairly ""non-<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_%28electronics%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">brickable</a>""... but no promises. Target date: Late September or early October.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Adventurous</b>:  The next batch will be 500 pcs and will be the final shot at the production firmware (release candidate). It will be delivered with all client software packaged in nice GUI's, firmware that is 99.9% error free and a hardware that is stable. This will be the first batch in a plastic enclosure. Target date: late October.  <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Final product - early bird discount:</b> For people who are early, who love the concept and just want the functionality, which would have been tested by all the backers before them. Only 1000 available. Target ship date: late November.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Final product - retail discount: </b>The final product. The is similar to the early bird, at a discounted retail price and including shipping. Also you would get early access due to the not being available on the market before Q1 2015 (at the earliest). Target date: Middle of December or it might be bundled with the late November shipment. </li>
<li>
<b>Final product - retail price including shipping: </b>The final product. This is similar to the early bird and retail discount. The price is the planned retail price but it including shipping 
as a discount and early access since the product not being available on the market before Q1 2015. Target date: Middle of December or it might 
be bundled with the late November shipment. </li>

Also, we need to setup the cloud infrastructure and surrounding software. We know that even though we have planned this very thoroughly, something will happen, so we have included a buffer.<br/><br/>Our rough budget of our spending:<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/682607/files/20140629123818-budget.png?1404070698"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>1800 backers will definitely not make us rich, we will have to invest all of our time and energy but we just love technology - we can't help it. The rough budget above is actually made on 3000 backers (firmware and software is somewhat fixed cost), so with more backers, there is more money for production.<br/><br/>The source codes and the schematic design of the box will be available, but not as free Open Source, all rights will be reserved. However we will supply you with the option of seeing what the box is running and allow you (if interested) to help us debug and possible even extend functionality and be creative. You will be able to flash it with a clean FreeRTOS and on that you could build your own application.<br/><br/>Why? Well, most of the source code is the Intellectual Property of Nabto and it has required fairly large investment. With this being the case, the software cannot be free, but we try to be as open as possible.<br/><br/><h1>The team and the story<br/>
</h1>The team is actually made of a cross-company team. All of us have worked together on existing projects so it's a well-knitted team of experienced members, all of who are experts in their field.<br/> <br/><b>Nabto</b><br/>We are a small, Danish company started in 2007. We make software for doing peer-to-peer direct remote access to small electronic based devices via the Internet. The software is put into devices like surveillance cameras, alarm systems, air conditioners, heating systems, building controls, sky-lights, industrial controls, solar-inverters, wind turbines, pretty much everything that runs on electricity. We sell this software to vendors, most of them you may be familiar with. We then, help them incorporate our software into their devices and applications, so the end-users of the vendors get better and universal access to the products; this in turn increases the value of the product.<br/><br/>We have been asked numerous times about packaging our product into a box for retro-fitting existing device, gizmos and solutions. Each time we said no thanks, we don't want to do that, too much risk, and it is not our job. What about marketing and how could we reach the market?. Then one customer told us, why don't you launch a crowd-funding project? He explained what that could do for us. So finally we thought, well let's try putting it out there, if the demand is found to be high enough, we will do it. There is nothing stopping us!<br/><b><br/>What's the deal with the funny N?</b>
<br/>The idea of the ""funny"" N is that it represents a bridge, creating a connection from one ""leg"" to the other.<br/> <br/><p>                                       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/668268/files/20140623032312-bridge-A-B.png?1403518992"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                                       Bridge from A to B<br/><br/>Nabto is an abbreviation for ""Network Access Bridge TO"" (like <a href=""mailto:)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mailto:)</a>. Which is essentially what we do. Creating network bridges (remote access) between end-users and devices 
making the end-users able to read-out and gain knowledge about devices 
and control their devices from anywhere. The platform enables universal 
secure remote access to the devices, but you can read more about Nabto

</h2><br/>Team at Nabto that will work on the project:<br/><ul>
<li>Carsten Rhod Gregersen, founder and CEO of Nabto. Overall management of the project.</li>
<li>Ulrik Gammelby, CTO of Nabto. Coordinate software development and technical management, while keeping up with milestones.</li>
<li>Michael Madsen, All-round Developer at Nabto. Software development on cloud infrastructure, firmware, USB and VPN integration.</li>
<li>Martin Rodalsgaard, Developer, primary HTML5 and user-interface design. Apple iOS and Android specialist.</li>

<li>Claus Anders, Developer. Mainly firmware. Key responsibility: Bootloader and production tools.<br/>
</li>
<li>Klaus Bay Madsen, Developer. Basestation and Windows integration.</li>
</ul><p>We will commit more people if necessary.</p><p><br/></p><b>FreeRTOS</b><br/>FreeRTOS is both supplying the RTOS and more specific helping with getting the basics of the board up and running. Richard Barry the founder of FreeRTOS is the primary team member from FreeRTOS.<br/>Read more about <a href=""www.freertos.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FreeRTOS</a><br/><br/><b>Majust<br/></b>Majust is a hardware consultancy company with lots of experience in both creating hardware but also supplying the surrounding software.  The main teammember from Majust is Jakob Justesen doing all the hardware, schematics, PCB wiring, soldering of prototypes, electrical certification etc. His co-founder Søren Madsen will maybe also be assisting with this project.<br/><br/><br/><h2>Shipping</h2><p>We have entities and offices in both Europe (Nabto ApS) and US (Nabto Inc.), the one in Denmark being our Headquarters, the US office primarily handling North American sales. We can ship to both EU and the US without much trouble (with customs).<br/></p><p><b>So the product will be shipped to both EU and US.</b></p><p>If there is significant interest from international backers, we will re-evaluate and possibly add an international option (outside US and EU). To be honest we already have experience with international exporting, so we are aware of the kind of trouble with f.x. customs we can run into, so we know it is not something we should do just for the ""fun"" of it.<br/><br/></p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>The majority of the parts of the solution is already running in our lab.<br/>Supplying remote access on low-cost hardware to our customers is our main business since 2007, so we don't see many risks in getting the technology to work, that is kind of our normal bread and butter. An example of a project done in-house is the Nabduino board.<br/><br/>The simple, remote access evaluation Nabduino board:<br/><a href=""http://nabduino.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://nabduino.com/</a><br/>Which is already selling around the world:<br/><a href=""http://nabduino.com/buy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://nabduino.com/buy</a><br/>(it's a product mainly for embedded tech people..)<br/>So we know what we are doing.<br/><br/><b>What we already have:<br/></b><ul>
<li>Prototype board with power regulation, Ethernet and USB. The basic board has been running the last 2 years for another project, so we are fairly confident of the ""basics"". <br/>
</li>
<li>The basic networking VPN layers on Linux and Microsoft via tuntap - command line.<br/>
</li>
<li>TCP Port tunneling - command-line<br/>
</li>
<li>USB virtual remote via USP-IP project</li>
<li>Enclosure design and printed 3D prototypes</li>
<li>Identified and tested power supplies<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>The basic functionality is up and running, but there is still some way to go before it is packaged into a simple, nice product.</p><br/><br/><b>What needs more work?</b><br/><ul>
<li>Adjust the current board so that it uses the LCP1758, power regulation and the ""environment"" should be fine. Some adjustment of LED, and the PCB needs to be a little smaller for the planned enclosure</li>
<li>Package the command line tools into a nice GUI</li>
<li>Cleanup the VPN code</li>
<li>Obtain a sub-contractor to create a plastic mold for the enclosure with the right dimensions and holes for the USB, power and Ethernet sockets.<br/>
</li>
</ul><br/>We have been doing production runs together, with and for customers as sub-contractors. Production of hardware is a risky business, short supply of components, receiving bad quality parts from sub-suppliers, receiving late shipments, finding alternative parts and getting them, any sudden change in production plans, quality testing and getting certification, the list goes on and on.. but, our team has dealt with this before.<br/><br/>This is not a no-risk operation, by any means, but we have been there and done it before. With the right amount of coffee, hard work and sweat (not to mention pizza, cola and angry wives/girlfriends waiting on us angry with frying pans ""in-hand"" when we get home late at night) we will get there again.<br/><br/><b>Extending the product<br/></b>We have the following ideas beyond stretch-goals:<br/><ul>
<li>
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake-on-LAN"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wake on LAN</a> (remote boot) <br/>
</li>
<li>LUA support so you can program the device<br/>
</li>
<li>WIFI via USB dongles<br/>
</li>
<li>Automatic discovery and integration to certain gizmos. That is if the box sees Gizmo's it knows about, it can do some magic to make easier for integration for the end-user (more than just generic port forwarding or P2PVPN). We will need backer help for this. We would need to know the MAC address range or something similar to discover and identify the Gizmo and what TCP ports to redirect automatically. <br/>

</ul><p><br/></p><h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><p><br/></p><p><b>The hardware price seems high compared to others like Raspberry PI?<br/></b></p><p>This is not just a hardware project, this is a product. Think of this as all-in-one software, enclosure, logistics, etc. We want to deliver a quality product and if the backing doesn't make room for that, we would rather not do the project. We believe the value of the product is high enough to carry the cost and if not, we will just let it be.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Why the NXP part and not X, Y, or Z part?</b><br/>The LCP1758 is a neat MCU/SoC. Lots of power for a fair price. Ethernet and USB (along with a ton of different other I/O options we are not using in this project). We have other projects running on a similar NXP part and it has proven to be very stable and easy to work with. We find GCC support a major requirement. Yes other embedded compilers might be 5-10% better, but having an open tool-chain makes things so much easier, especially when working in a multi-contry and multi-group code project.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Why not a Linux (or Windows Embedded) based box?</b><br/></p><p>We love Linux. We are all fans of Linux, but we need to chose
the right tool for the job. The intention is not to create a 
multipurpose box, though with the right tools it can be modular and 
extendible (LUA). Running Linux would also require a faster processor, more memory, and more complexity. Using our generic hardware abstraction layer we might make the device software able to run on a Linux box, but that would be a very late milestone.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Why FreeRTOS?</b><br/>We have an existing relationship with the founder of FreeRTOS Richard Barry. We have a fairly amount of experience with the RTOS, that's why. Choosing something new would infer risk, and nobody likes risks.</p><p><br/></p><p></p> <p><i>..because we love awesome technology...</i></p><p><br/></p></div>","Simple and secure peer-to-peer remote access to your home network Gizmos - in one-click
..because we love awesome technology...What is the Nabto-box? Pronounced (nab-toe)The Nabto-box takes the ability of peer-to-peer technology (like Skype) and allows you to remotely connect anything from anywhere, yes you read that correctly - ANYWHERE! Also, the ability of VPN to create a virtual network cable spanning long distances across the Internet, mix and stir and put it in a box. Well, that is pretty much it in a nutshell.Peer-to-peer technology makes it easy to setup the direct connection, VPN technology makes your PC, smartphone and tablet think they are connected to a remote network. Join the two, put it in a box and you will wield the same power as large scale VPN solutions for accessing company networks. The only difference is that instead of being an advanced and complicated solution it is a seamless and easy solution in a small box, just plug it into your home network and it will deliver remote access to your home network from anywhere.Always be connected to your home.. Imagine you could establish a remote connection to your home network just as easy
 as you make a call on Skype or sending an email. One simple box located in your home connected to your network allows you to seamlessly create a remote connection and be connected to your home network with just one
 click.Access anything connected.. You can access, readout the status and control your networked thermostats, stream files from your PVR or media server, view the output of your surveillance cameras, 
alarm-system, get files from your NAS 
box or file-server, stop or start your lawn irrigation system, pool control system, even if the devices didn't have an remote connect option installed... the 
possibilities are endless.                                                      The final product we are aiming at                                    (we are changing the power socket to USB)Why Nabto-box?Nabto-box is a retrofit solution for non-remote accessible networked Gizmos. A lot of Gizmos are born with network capabilities (like Ethernet or WIFI) and some newer Gizmos can also be reached remotely with the right remote access APP or software (which btw. is what we normally do), however the vast majority of Gizmos was only designed with local network access in mind, combined with cumbersome remote access. This is not a direct reflection of the vendor, it's because remote P2P access is hard to do.Increase value of your existing GizmosThe Nabto-box will extend the functionality and value of your existing networked Gizmos by making them reachable from anywhere, don't you think it is a cliché that you are able to reach out to most of the world via the Internet, but not be able to reach your own home?Other usages - Be your own VPN service providerWhen you connect to the Nabtobox, all traffic will be directed to the box and onto your home network. Therefore if you are surfing the internet your public IP address will be the current IP address of your router.Occasionally internet services are bound only service customers to a specific IP range of specific geographic locations. Many streaming services for music and movies have only acquired the rights for the material for a certain geographic area. With a connection established to a Nabtobox on your home network to these services the IP address revealed will be the one from your home network.  Yes it can be done today; we just make it super easy...Have you ever tried to setup Internet based remote access for Gizmos placed on your home network? If you have you will know that this 
can be an awfully cumbersome, teeth grinding and nail-biting experience, in which you might end up with no result, 
but a lot of waste of your time and hair-loss from extensive pulling.Nobody likes to read thick heavy manuals ...Setting up remote access involves reading 
heavy technical manuals on how to configure your router/firewall with stuff 
like Dynamical DNS, Port-forwarding, setting static IP addresses on your 
gizmo, or maybe creating a SSH-VPN tunnel etc. And sometimes it cannot be done... Or perhaps your Internet Service Provider doesn't even allow 
you to administer your own router and firewall then you are really stuck!Here's some examples from the web (sounds easy?):PC-world on how to setup portforwardingPanasonic on setting up your router for port forwardingMicrosoft on setting up portforwarding to allow remote access to DesktopEven if you successfully are able to get through all of the mumbo-jumbo firewall configuration and got it to work. Are you aware that you just created an open door for the whole internet to access  your Gizmo? A black-hat hacker or script-kiddie with a port scanner and knowledge of a security breach could break into your home and immediately your network is exposed.Now if you are an expert, coped with the firewall and you are even so smart that you setup some security measures (or so you think) and got it all right the Nabto-box can still be something for you. If we reach our goal the box not only delivers remote access to your home network, but also remote USB access and we even have an option with interfaces for the hardcore electronic geeks (UART and general I/O) for connecting other non-connected stuff (NB: both virtual P2P USB and UART & I/O are stretch goals).How and what do I need to do?
You of course need to get your hands on the box. Then, you will need to connect the power supply and connect the Ethernet port to your router. Voila now the box is on your local network - and after a short installation of software you can connect to it from anywhere.Let's take a peek at the steps involved - the softwareYou will need to configure the box when you are at home, so the box knows who you are and only letting you connect. This involves pairing your end-user device (PC or similar) and email with the box. This is the steps involved in getting the box up and running:                                                   Explained in more detail:
Install the client software on your PC. The software will automatically discover the box and the box will automatically be able to see that you are connecting from the same local network and will assign you administrator permissions by default. The unique box name (identity) will be remembered by the client software and pair your box and PC (the ID of the box is something like: 4e12.nabtobox.net and this will be remembered by the software)

The software will ask you about your email account and a password - don't fret! Behind the scenes: a private and public key will be generated and the public-key is sent to a CA and a certificate will be issued to you with the assigned email you typed. The private key will be protected with the password.
Now go remote. Right click on the Nabto icon in your task-bar and click ""Connect home"" you will in matter of seconds be remote connected directly to your home network. What happens is that your operating system will detect a new virtual network interface installed by the software and all traffic on this network will be directed to the Nabto-box on your home network.

                                       Right click on the Nabto icon and click ""Connect home""Isn't that Connect - Simple and Secure?The Nabto-box ships mainly to Europe (EU and EFTA) and North America .We have offices in both EU and United States, so we are sure we can get boxes to you in these locations. Also EFTA (European Free Trade Association) and countries with free trade agreements should be no problem. Please see http://www.efta.int/ (the free trade map).If you order the ""International Shipping"" option we will promise to put your address on the box, pay for the shipping and deliver it to the mailing service. But you need to handle customs and import restrictions yourself (the box contains strong encryption). We will also promise to help you as much as we can with information etc., but we know from experience that international shipping can be troublesome.Currently planned goal and stretch goals:     So now you’ve got the basics!  This should be all you need to know if you
are interested in owning a Nabto-box or how to operate the product. Keep reading if you want to know more about us as a company,
our plan and how we are able to deliver on our promises.  Some of the text is somewhat technical, we
really try to make it easy to understand, but sometimes we fall short (we are
engineers) so bear with us, or possibly help us help you.
TechnologyWhy not start with our passion...The quick and dirty explanation of the concept for tech people: It's a Peer-to-peer VPN and port tunneling solution (which you probably already guessed).
A more detailed explanation:A Virtual Private Network (VPN) interface is installed on your computer and a secure peer-to-peer connection is made from your computer to your Nabto-box on your home network. Your computer will be ""fooled"" into thinking it is directly attached to your home network and you can make the connections to your home Gizmos, as usual. You could also regard it as a very, very, VERY long network cable (just virtual) that is always connected from your computer to your home network.Another method is to tunnel the underlying protocol, normally TCP, which is a well-known approach used in solutions like SSH. A P2P (Peer-to-Peer) based TCP tunnel is created from the client-end-user-device to the Gizmo on your home network. This TCP tunnel is normally the port 80 of a Web-server interface. A ""channel"" to the port 80 of the Gizmo is opened on the end-user-device (a port) and when f.x. the browser is communicating with this ""channel"" it is fooled to believe it is communicating with the web-server on the Gizmo.   The protocol underneath the VPN is the same type of P2P technology that you experience every day in products like Skype. Basically you use a well-known rendezvous point (a server) on the Internet to get two devices to collaborate and create a direct connection between them. The rendezvous point is just a place to exchange Internet addresses and other information of how the two device can meet up.The rendezvous is done fairly quickly and will only transfer limited information between the parties to successfully create the final P2P channel. Once this P2P is established the rendezvous server is not needed and one server can hence be rendezvous point for multiple (not unlimited, but a fairly large number with at least 6 figures depending on the server hardware) clients and boxes.You can read more about the basics of peer-to-peer connection establishment here:http://www.brynosaurus.com/pub/net/p2pnat/Keep in mind.. our task is to hide all this and make it simple and secure for you. The NAT-traversal described in the above is quite simple; you are able to do different tricks to get a better results.Read more on the Nabto software here:http://nabto.com/#download-listHere you can also play around with the generic device software (Linux, Windows, and different embedded platforms). Notice, this is software for skilled embedded software engineers with an in depth understanding of software and Internet protocols:What about security?If every person on the Internet was able to just create a P2P connection to your box, off course we solved nothing, we just made things worse. A two way authentication system is designed as part of the rendezvous connection protocol; this protocol is based on the same mechanisms inside of the well-known SSL (TLS) protocol. Public key infrastructure is used to establish authentication and establish symmetric keys (AES), which then are used to encrypt the P2P communication channel. Only authenticated persons will be able to make the remote connection once created, with the heavy encryption it will then be very secure.The specific ways to interface the remote connectionThere are 4 ways to interface the remote connection. Although it is possible with the hardware this is not all inclusive, if our goals are exceeded it will be included.

Virtual network P2P access. A virtual network interface will be created on your client device. When activated it will create a P2P communication channel with the Nabto-box and to your client device with the software running on it, it will resemble the client device connected to your home network. This is not always possible - it requires that the two networks are not in the same IP range to avoid conflict. When two Gizmos are assigned to the same IP address, the one on your home network and the other located on the network you are currently attached to, the software is unable to determine which Gizmo you actually want to talk to. Ways to circumvent this (disabling your local network traffic or advanced NAT techniques) exists, but this is definitely not for the first versions of the software. Another way to accomplish what you want is TCP port tunneling.


TCP port tunneling. A specific communication port on your Gizmo will be forwarded and bound to a port (normally the same) on your client device (PC, smartphone or tablet). When you
 access this port on your local client device a P2P connection will 
automatically be setup to your Gizmo forwarding all traffic back and 
forth.

Our long-term goals are identified with the remaining two ways:

Stretch goal 1: GPIO. Since the NXP LPC1758 SoC (System on Chip) has many general purpose IO's and we want to make a PIN out header on the board and make software for easy accessing both digital and analog interfaces. By doing this, the box can be used to connect to all kinds of electronics and sensors. Here is an example of how you can connect a relay to PIN's on another board we have done: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_OOZYgIYHQ


Stretch goal 2: Virtual remote USB. Since the NXP LPC1758 SoC is born with a USB OTG interface it could be possible to access non-connected 
gizmos via USB. Most SoC's are born with a USB interface, so if this options is included similar to the virtual network interface above, you will be able to remotely reach the USB interface via a virtual USB interface on your client device. The only requirement would be that the gizmo would have USB 
interface and you are then able to seamlessly remote access it from 
anywhere. Simply activate the virtual USB interface and tell it to connect to the USB interface on the Nabto-box. Your client device will think it is a local USB port. We have experienced issues with this. Combination of high latency connections (let's say across the Atlantic) and bad USB protocol designs can be a challenge (100ms latency combined with a one byte request/response protocol makes a 10 bytes/second transmission rate). This will only be available for Windows, Linux and Mac.

   What We Need & What You Receive We have a proof-of-concept prototype currently up and running, both hardware and software. In order to complete this and start production the time and cost to manage these tasks are needed.Below, you will find a picture of a prototype of the enclosure of the final product. The box contains sockets for Ethernet, USB and Power sockets. However, on the final product we will do a row of holes with LED-light guides for colored LED's on the PCB that will indicate the status of the device.                              Makerbot print of early enclosure prototype SpecificationsSoftwareThe base station is planned to run in Amazon EC2 services. Been there, done that. TCP tunneling is already part of the basic software. We have a prototype of a P2P-VPN solution, but it will need some adjustments and a lot of testing. Also we have a P2P virtual USB prototype solution,  but this will definitely require some work, why we also will do it as stretch goal. PCBThe board will be completed based upon an existing design, with a track record of years of proven stability and tolerance to heat, cold, moisture, and housewives banging with vacuum cleaners. The only portion that will be enhanced is the MCU, and the UART to RS485 level converters and RJ45 sockets (not the Ethernet) etc. will be dropped. It has to be a little more compact, but otherwise it is the same board. The USB socket and connection has to be enabled (you can spot the pin-outs just behind the black RJ45 on the right side). The SoCThe SoC (system on chip) will be a LPC1758FBD80, ARM cortex M3, 100Mhz, 512kb flash, and 64kb of RAM. Ethernet and USB OTG. A SoC in a LFPQ casing that people (with a very steady hand and a lot of patience) are able to hand solder ""easily"" (as opposed to BGA). With more power for the purpose, a lot more than the current need. We have concluded it would be nice and could come in handy later and all while being cost efficient.You could ask, why not WIFI? Well, for simplicity reasons and cost-efficiency. To plug a box into a home network (the router or similar) this is something everyone can do. The box doesn't need mobility, as long as it is on the network it doesn't matter where it is physically placed. Ghz signals are also as close to magic and wizardry as you can get (PCB wiring is not just ""wiring"" anymore in the Ghz spectrum, why we would like to stay in the Mhz spectrum).The RTOS and device softwareThe box will run FreeRTOS. This is a very small real time Operating System using very limited resources. The box could probably be done just running a simple scheduler loop, but having a RTOS is nice for all the reasons we currently don't know about. Power supplyOur standard supplier of (switching) power supplies needs a MOQ of 1000 pcs. If we cannot get to that, we'll find a replacement from a distributor. We started out with a 3.5x5.5mm power socket on the box. But due to request we are changing it to micro USB power in the process guessing its easier to come by and more standardized.Plastic enclosureThis is probably the largest pain. Doing plastic enclosures is difficult. To get the right quality, match the PCB, get the holes to match the sockets on the PCB, draft angles, and with just the right amount of spacing, not too much and not too little. We have experienced sub-suppliers who mirrored the 3D CAD drawings, supplying us with enclosures with everything right, in a mirrored Doppelgänger world, that is. The first prototype will be done on our own Makerbot Replicator 2, after 2-3 enclosures will be printed on a SLA  machine (or similar).If you own a 3D printer or have one available, you will be able to print the enclosures, in house. We will upload the drawings when finished.                                                              Enclosure done in FreeCADWhat is our plan?This is our plan:
The first early prototype PCB rolls of 10 pcs, will not be public. Hopefully will be right in first shot (since we are reusing an old design with modifications). But we plan a second test-roll and possible third (hope not). We will do this when the campaign is running.


Hardcore tech-backers - Alpha release: First test production run will be 50 pcs available. We want to find people out there who can help test the boards but also test the first software shipments doing peer-to-peer transmissions and obtain results from various types of firewall and internet setups in conjunction with the board. We call this group ""Hardcore tech-backers"". This shipment will be the board alone with appropriate rubber/plastic spacers on the backside, i.e. low WAF. There will not be any fancy enclosures, but we will release the drawings (both the FreeCAD and STL) so the option to 3D print one would be available. The firmware would be an ALPHA firmware and only include basic functionality like the RTOS, IP stack and remote P2P TCP tunneling firmware when we ship it. But, it will be installed with a Ethernet based bootloader (our own TFTP based one) so you can upgrade it with the new versions of the firmware with any PC. New firmware versions would be continuously released. This initial batch is only for people with a fair amount of technical knowledge (and patience). All of the source code will be included together with instructions on how to compile, flash and debug if you choose to help us. In our software stack you would have the ability to (via the local network) get debug traces from the firmware. When in debugging mode the box will broadcasts all ""trace"" commands from the firmware (which can be gathered by special supplied software). Further, we have a plugin for Wireshark so it is simple to follow the network transmissions.  The board will have a status of evaluation kit, so it will not be run through certifications (CE and etc.). To the hardcore techies, the board itself should be valuable as a way to play with FreeRTOS on an Internet connected and well-equipped board. Our goal is to have this completed and shipped by mid-September.


Beta tester: After the alpha tests, we will need a larger population of beta tester that actually test the board. This batch will be 250 pcs. It will include the first BETA of the production version of the firmware, which would be a more stable release and with more features implemented. This is a batch for people who are used to dealing with technology, but you don't need to be a hardcore C-programmer. At this stage the firmware should work and be error-free in most environments. The user tools would be packaged in neat applications (mostly error free), however we expect that you probably need to flash one or two new firmware versions to get full capabilities. This batch should be fairly ""non-brickable""... but no promises. Target date: Late September or early October.


Adventurous:  The next batch will be 500 pcs and will be the final shot at the production firmware (release candidate). It will be delivered with all client software packaged in nice GUI's, firmware that is 99.9% error free and a hardware that is stable. This will be the first batch in a plastic enclosure. Target date: late October.  


Final product - early bird discount: For people who are early, who love the concept and just want the functionality, which would have been tested by all the backers before them. Only 1000 available. Target ship date: late November.


Final product - retail discount: The final product. The is similar to the early bird, at a discounted retail price and including shipping. Also you would get early access due to the not being available on the market before Q1 2015 (at the earliest). Target date: Middle of December or it might be bundled with the late November shipment. 

Final product - retail price including shipping: The final product. This is similar to the early bird and retail discount. The price is the planned retail price but it including shipping 
as a discount and early access since the product not being available on the market before Q1 2015. Target date: Middle of December or it might 
be bundled with the late November shipment. 
                               Our calculations determine we need to get past 1800 (around $75,000) backers to get past the point of the raw costs of hardware design, components, PCB and enclosure design and prototyping, molds for plastic enclosures, plastic enclosure production and the device software development costs, not to forget packaging and logistic costs. Also, we need to setup the cloud infrastructure and surrounding software. We know that even though we have planned this very thoroughly, something will happen, so we have included a buffer.Our rough budget of our spending:1800 backers will definitely not make us rich, we will have to invest all of our time and energy but we just love technology - we can't help it. The rough budget above is actually made on 3000 backers (firmware and software is somewhat fixed cost), so with more backers, there is more money for production.The source codes and the schematic design of the box will be available, but not as free Open Source, all rights will be reserved. However we will supply you with the option of seeing what the box is running and allow you (if interested) to help us debug and possible even extend functionality and be creative. You will be able to flash it with a clean FreeRTOS and on that you could build your own application.Why? Well, most of the source code is the Intellectual Property of Nabto and it has required fairly large investment. With this being the case, the software cannot be free, but we try to be as open as possible.The team and the story
The team is actually made of a cross-company team. All of us have worked together on existing projects so it's a well-knitted team of experienced members, all of who are experts in their field. NabtoWe are a small, Danish company started in 2007. We make software for doing peer-to-peer direct remote access to small electronic based devices via the Internet. The software is put into devices like surveillance cameras, alarm systems, air conditioners, heating systems, building controls, sky-lights, industrial controls, solar-inverters, wind turbines, pretty much everything that runs on electricity. We sell this software to vendors, most of them you may be familiar with. We then, help them incorporate our software into their devices and applications, so the end-users of the vendors get better and universal access to the products; this in turn increases the value of the product.We have been asked numerous times about packaging our product into a box for retro-fitting existing device, gizmos and solutions. Each time we said no thanks, we don't want to do that, too much risk, and it is not our job. What about marketing and how could we reach the market?. Then one customer told us, why don't you launch a crowd-funding project? He explained what that could do for us. So finally we thought, well let's try putting it out there, if the demand is found to be high enough, we will do it. There is nothing stopping us!What's the deal with the funny N?
The idea of the ""funny"" N is that it represents a bridge, creating a connection from one ""leg"" to the other.                                                                                               Bridge from A to BNabto is an abbreviation for ""Network Access Bridge TO"" (like mailto:). Which is essentially what we do. Creating network bridges (remote access) between end-users and devices 
making the end-users able to read-out and gain knowledge about devices 
and control their devices from anywhere. The platform enables universal 
secure remote access to the devices, but you can read more about Nabto 
on out website.The team at Nabto
Team at Nabto that will work on the project:
Carsten Rhod Gregersen, founder and CEO of Nabto. Overall management of the project.
Ulrik Gammelby, CTO of Nabto. Coordinate software development and technical management, while keeping up with milestones.
Michael Madsen, All-round Developer at Nabto. Software development on cloud infrastructure, firmware, USB and VPN integration.
Martin Rodalsgaard, Developer, primary HTML5 and user-interface design. Apple iOS and Android specialist.
Jan Kullebo, Developer. Embedded firmware and board integration, and some user-interface design.
Claus Anders, Developer. Mainly firmware. Key responsibility: Bootloader and production tools.

Klaus Bay Madsen, Developer. Basestation and Windows integration.
We will commit more people if necessary.FreeRTOSFreeRTOS is both supplying the RTOS and more specific helping with getting the basics of the board up and running. Richard Barry the founder of FreeRTOS is the primary team member from FreeRTOS.Read more about FreeRTOSMajustMajust is a hardware consultancy company with lots of experience in both creating hardware but also supplying the surrounding software.  The main teammember from Majust is Jakob Justesen doing all the hardware, schematics, PCB wiring, soldering of prototypes, electrical certification etc. His co-founder Søren Madsen will maybe also be assisting with this project.ShippingWe have entities and offices in both Europe (Nabto ApS) and US (Nabto Inc.), the one in Denmark being our Headquarters, the US office primarily handling North American sales. We can ship to both EU and the US without much trouble (with customs).So the product will be shipped to both EU and US.If there is significant interest from international backers, we will re-evaluate and possibly add an international option (outside US and EU). To be honest we already have experience with international exporting, so we are aware of the kind of trouble with f.x. customs we can run into, so we know it is not something we should do just for the ""fun"" of it.Risks & Challenges  The majority of the parts of the solution is already running in our lab.Supplying remote access on low-cost hardware to our customers is our main business since 2007, so we don't see many risks in getting the technology to work, that is kind of our normal bread and butter. An example of a project done in-house is the Nabduino board.The simple, remote access evaluation Nabduino board:http://nabduino.com/Which is already selling around the world:http://nabduino.com/buy(it's a product mainly for embedded tech people..)So we know what we are doing.What we already have:
Prototype board with power regulation, Ethernet and USB. The basic board has been running the last 2 years for another project, so we are fairly confident of the ""basics"". 

The basic networking VPN layers on Linux and Microsoft via tuntap - command line.

TCP Port tunneling - command-line

USB virtual remote via USP-IP project
Enclosure design and printed 3D prototypes
Identified and tested power supplies

The basic functionality is up and running, but there is still some way to go before it is packaged into a simple, nice product.What needs more work?
Adjust the current board so that it uses the LCP1758, power regulation and the ""environment"" should be fine. Some adjustment of LED, and the PCB needs to be a little smaller for the planned enclosure
Package the command line tools into a nice GUI
Cleanup the VPN code
Obtain a sub-contractor to create a plastic mold for the enclosure with the right dimensions and holes for the USB, power and Ethernet sockets.

We have been doing production runs together, with and for customers as sub-contractors. Production of hardware is a risky business, short supply of components, receiving bad quality parts from sub-suppliers, receiving late shipments, finding alternative parts and getting them, any sudden change in production plans, quality testing and getting certification, the list goes on and on.. but, our team has dealt with this before.This is not a no-risk operation, by any means, but we have been there and done it before. With the right amount of coffee, hard work and sweat (not to mention pizza, cola and angry wives/girlfriends waiting on us angry with frying pans ""in-hand"" when we get home late at night) we will get there again.Extending the productWe have the following ideas beyond stretch-goals:

Wake on LAN (remote boot) 

LUA support so you can program the device

WIFI via USB dongles

Automatic discovery and integration to certain gizmos. That is if the box sees Gizmo's it knows about, it can do some magic to make easier for integration for the end-user (more than just generic port forwarding or P2PVPN). We will need backer help for this. We would need to know the MAC address range or something similar to discover and identify the Gizmo and what TCP ports to redirect automatically. 

  Other Ways You Can Help If you are not able to contribute monetarily, but still wants to help. Help us:
Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. 

Or if you want to contribute with good ideas of what we can put into the firmware. We have chosen a rather large SoC, so we have room to expand.
Are you proficient at coding? Especially people with Linux, Windows, Mac TUN/TAP or USB experience. You are welcome to join us!

Frequently Asked QuestionsThe hardware price seems high compared to others like Raspberry PI?This is not just a hardware project, this is a product. Think of this as all-in-one software, enclosure, logistics, etc. We want to deliver a quality product and if the backing doesn't make room for that, we would rather not do the project. We believe the value of the product is high enough to carry the cost and if not, we will just let it be.Why the NXP part and not X, Y, or Z part?The LCP1758 is a neat MCU/SoC. Lots of power for a fair price. Ethernet and USB (along with a ton of different other I/O options we are not using in this project). We have other projects running on a similar NXP part and it has proven to be very stable and easy to work with. We find GCC support a major requirement. Yes other embedded compilers might be 5-10% better, but having an open tool-chain makes things so much easier, especially when working in a multi-contry and multi-group code project.Why not a Linux (or Windows Embedded) based box?We love Linux. We are all fans of Linux, but we need to chose
the right tool for the job. The intention is not to create a 
multipurpose box, though with the right tools it can be modular and 
extendible (LUA). Running Linux would also require a faster processor, more memory, and more complexity. Using our generic hardware abstraction layer we might make the device software able to run on a Linux box, but that would be a very late milestone.Why FreeRTOS?We have an existing relationship with the founder of FreeRTOS Richard Barry. We have a fairly amount of experience with the RTOS, that's why. Choosing something new would infer risk, and nobody likes risks. ..because we love awesome technology...",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hammock-chair “Kolyhva” is unique Ukrainian product, its roots coming out of Tripoli culture, and has no analogues in the world. “Kolyhva” combines features of both a hammock and a lounge chair.

<p>""Kolyhva” is a result of my efforts on the improvement of hammock design. In such a way that you can make swaying movements due to the partial landing of your body and by using your legs. With your feet on the ground, you would most probably start making such sideway movements without even thinking about it. This is more than likely to make you feel relaxed and comfy.</p>

<br/> </div></div></div>","Hammock-chair “Kolyhva” is unique Ukrainian product, its roots coming out of Tripoli culture, and has no analogues in the world. “Kolyhva” combines features of both a hammock and a lounge chair. Comfortable and easy to use, this hammock-chair is far ahead of all the other existing world alternatives.
 
 

 

 
Wherever you are : on the wild beach, near the pool, at the backyard of your sweet home, having a break at your office, traveling by car or even by yacht - this solution won't leave you indifferent. 

""Kolyhva” is a result of my efforts on the improvement of hammock design. In such a way that you can make swaying movements due to the partial landing of your body and by using your legs. With your feet on the ground, you would most probably start making such sideway movements without even thinking about it. This is more than likely to make you feel relaxed and comfy.

<h1>UNIQUE <em>Light Shows for the</em> holidays </h1>
<p>Even though holiday lighting is a key element of holiday decorating, it has been largely stagnant and unchanged for years. In Home Depot, Target, and Costco, the holiday light sets offered for sale are all standard – similar light string length, fixed colors, same shape packaged in a box –  for years. There has been relatively little innovation in the Holiday Lighting industry as fast food, and the current lighting systems limit the creativity and the joyfulness of most holiday decorators and of their family members.</p>
<p>Living in Silicon Valley, our team has experienced how technology makes our life more convenient and greener. Why not apply our innovations on those traditional holiday lights? We started our project from a whiteboard and brainstormed about how to make every Christmas tree look unique and dynamic in the local communities. After spending a few months of research, experiments, and prototype creations on our new Holiday Light Set, we believe we have reached our expectations that we can now bring our prototype to indiegogo and ask your help to refine and manufacture this fun project. </p>
<p> </p>
<h1>What are the key features? </h1>
<div>
<p><strong><strong>Low Power, Safe, Portable.</strong></strong> After our research and evaluation, we chose the special LED bulbs and strings that minimize the power consumption in our lights, optimized the circuits, and eventually made the new lighting system very low voltage for your portability and safety. Even a portable battery for your smartphone can run the light sets for hours. Our customized Lights consumes only <em>5.5%</em> energy of traditional lights, and <em>30-40%</em> of the regular LED lights with same bulb quantity!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/179/303/9adfa96a511e01f2f337aef24ebddaa6_large.jpg?1348686766"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<strong><strong>Extendable and Stackable.</strong> </strong>If you have a taller tree or bigger wreath, you can order 2 sets and stack them for long length. The water-resistant connectors of our light cables and strands are universal. </div>
<div class=""template asset""> </div>
</div>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/179/224/b91dedb6b3690e9063e4557fbbebc85f_large.jpg?1348684518"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Flexible and Configurable. </strong>We improved the system by enabling plug-n-play of LED strands in different colors and with gadgets. This allows you to flexibly change colors at anytime. If your kids happen to change their mind on their decorations yesterday, simply replace with a different color/shape/sparkling style/order in a few minutes. </p>
<p><strong>More Dynamic E</strong><strong>ffects. </strong>To add more dynamic effects to the lighting system, we have incorporated a 3-channel programmed remote control that governs<strong>on/off, dimming, and blinking</strong> effects as well as adjusts <strong>the speed of animation</strong>. This guarantees you to have your own light show right away after you open the package. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/179/287/0f3db9530f7e748405b08165c721b0de_large.JPG?1348686086"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div> <strong>Interchangeable </strong><strong>Gadgets &amp; </strong><strong>Decorative Covers.</strong> You can never changed a decorative cover on a purchased light, but now you can do so in our lighting project. We make it plug-n-play so your kids can choose the one they like and put it on the tree like any other Christmas ornaments. </div>
<div><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/179/228/a74922ad9bcdca40d69bedc083f3ba34_large.jpg?1348684542"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div>Each child in your family may choose his or her favorite lights &amp; gadgets and attach them to the tree. If they change their minds the next day, no problem. They can simply choose another branch strand or decorative cover and replace them within 30 seconds. With our lights, the holiday decorator can be creative in all aspects of decorating!</div>

<h1>What are included in your rewards? </h1>
<p><strong>Wreath Set </strong><br/>The Wreath Set is a special gift that we tailored as a Thank You Gift for our supporters.

This set has all innovative features throughout our design: free selection/change of light colors, interchangeable decorative covers, stackable strands, low power consumption, and also dynamic.  Here is <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFSEekU8dCA&amp;feature=plcp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a video</a> of how to decorate a wreath with this light set. </p>

<p>We [Joey, Jeff, and Jim] have redesigned FlexiLights countless times over the past 6 months. We are now ready to take FlexiLights into full production. Thats why we need your help. </p>

</div></div>","UNIQUE Light Shows for the holidays 
Even though holiday lighting is a key element of holiday decorating, it has been largely stagnant and unchanged for years. In Home Depot, Target, and Costco, the holiday light sets offered for sale are all standard – similar light string length, fixed colors, same shape packaged in a box –  for years. There has been relatively little innovation in the Holiday Lighting industry as fast food, and the current lighting systems limit the creativity and the joyfulness of most holiday decorators and of their family members.
Living in Silicon Valley, our team has experienced how technology makes our life more convenient and greener. Why not apply our innovations on those traditional holiday lights? We started our project from a whiteboard and brainstormed about how to make every Christmas tree look unique and dynamic in the local communities. After spending a few months of research, experiments, and prototype creations on our new Holiday Light Set, we believe we have reached our expectations that we can now bring our prototype to indiegogo and ask your help to refine and manufacture this fun project. 
 
What are the key features? 

Low Power, Safe, Portable. After our research and evaluation, we chose the special LED bulbs and strings that minimize the power consumption in our lights, optimized the circuits, and eventually made the new lighting system very low voltage for your portability and safety. Even a portable battery for your smartphone can run the light sets for hours. Our customized Lights consumes only 5.5% energy of traditional lights, and 30-40% of the regular LED lights with same bulb quantity!


Extendable and Stackable. If you have a taller tree or bigger wreath, you can order 2 sets and stack them for long length. The water-resistant connectors of our light cables and strands are universal. 
 


 

Flexible and Configurable. We improved the system by enabling plug-n-play of LED strands in different colors and with gadgets. This allows you to flexibly change colors at anytime. If your kids happen to change their mind on their decorations yesterday, simply replace with a different color/shape/sparkling style/order in a few minutes. 
More Dynamic Effects. To add more dynamic effects to the lighting system, we have incorporated a 3-channel programmed remote control that governson/off, dimming, and blinking effects as well as adjusts the speed of animation. This guarantees you to have your own light show right away after you open the package. 


 Interchangeable Gadgets & Decorative Covers. You can never changed a decorative cover on a purchased light, but now you can do so in our lighting project. We make it plug-n-play so your kids can choose the one they like and put it on the tree like any other Christmas ornaments. 

Each child in your family may choose his or her favorite lights & gadgets and attach them to the tree. If they change their minds the next day, no problem. They can simply choose another branch strand or decorative cover and replace them within 30 seconds. With our lights, the holiday decorator can be creative in all aspects of decorating!
 
What are included in your rewards? 
Wreath Set The Wreath Set is a special gift that we tailored as a Thank You Gift for our supporters. Wiring is a big issue for the wreath, especially when you need to open and close the door everyday. We now solve it! The set charges itself during the day and automatically illuminates at night. This set has all innovative features throughout our design: free selection/change of light colors, interchangeable decorative covers, stackable strands, low power consumption, and also dynamic.  Here is a video of how to decorate a wreath with this light set. 
As one of the most valuable benefits of our lighting system, choose your favorite colors in yellow, pink, blue, green, and auto-blinking all-color for each LED strand. We may include more colors if we receive sufficient support from the indiegogo community. Decorative Covers  


Christmas Tree SetThis is one of the most innovative designs for tree decorations. Every family member can join the lighting decoration and share the fun because of the safety (5V low voltage). You can change colors of a branch or move around gadgets at anytime. It's also upgrade-able: over years, add more or change decorative covers like how you add/change traditional ornaments. 
The Premium Tree set supplies abundant lights and gadgets for a 8' tree with heavy thick branches. The Standard Tree set supplies enough of lights and decorations for a shorter tree or a tree been already crowded with other ornaments. The custom 3-channel remote control helps catch every visitor's attention of your unique tree decorations.  

As one of the most valuable benefits of our lighting system, choose your favorite colors in yellow, pink, blue, green, and auto-blinking all-color for each LED strand. We may include more colors if we receive sufficient support from the indiegogo community. Decorative Covers  




 
 

We [Joey, Jeff, and Jim] have redesigned FlexiLights countless times over the past 6 months. We are now ready to take FlexiLights into full production. Thats why we need your help. 
To make sure our backers can enjoy the light shows for the upcoming Christmas and Hanukah seasons, we have simplified the project, while kept most of the innovative designs, to lower the barrier of fund raising.

<p>I am asking for $6,750 to fund this project in order to get my design produced as quickly as possible. With the amount of attention that it has gained, there is no way I would be able to single handedly produce these in a reasonable time frame. The funds include, but are not limited to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost to get these produced.</li>
<li>Cost to get the fabric inspected by safety third parties.</li>
<li>Cost to pack, and warehouse the goods overseas and domestically.</li>
<li>Cost to import goods into the US to be distributed ASAP.</li>
<li>Cost to cover any additional international packages such as the UK that require more funds to get there securely.</li>
<li>Cost for door-to-door delivery, from my forwarder to packing location.</li>
<li>Maybe one pizza while I write the labels out :o)</li>
<li>Lastly, the packaging and shipping to get them to your front door!</li>
</ul><p><strong>Here's a price breakdown!</strong></p>
<p>50% goes to manufacturing (producing, safety checks)</p>
<p>30% goes to importing them (customs, freight shipping, forwarding)</p>
<p>10% goes to supplies and shipping (such as a boxes! tape! postage! yay!)</p>
<p>9% goes towards indigogo processing fees</p>
<p>1% goes to 10 pizzas, sodas, and chips, as bribery to friends that will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate all names/addresses/etc on a shipping label</li>
<li>Print that label, stick it on a box</li>
<li>Put your fluffy goodness in the box</li>
<li>Tape the boxes up </li>
<li>Help deiliver the boxes to UPS the same day its packed</li>
<li>Make sure everything is organized and stuff! :)</li>
<li>Make sure you have an awesome experience</li>
<li>Be very thankful for your awesomeness!</li>
</ul><p>I'd like to clarify that <strong>this is not a flexible funding project,</strong> so either the project makes it or it doesn't. I did not want to flexible fund this as the funds would all directly going towards the project itself, and I didn't want to just run off with unused money that won't go towards the initial goal for its intended purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Raffle Rules &amp; Information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Single $5 Pledge = 1 Raffle ticket</li>
<li>Multiple Raffle Pledges are Allowed</li>
</ul><p>Make sure to share! The more raffle entrees, the more squishy's we can give out! I mean, come on.. who doesn't love the squishies? :D</p>
<p><strong>As some folks have been asking:</strong></p>
<p>For this project, Indiegogo will return your funds to you if the project is not successful. Only if it is successful, will they be fully withdrawn as a permanent method. Please contact me if you have any other questions!</p>

Cost to get these produced.
Cost to get the fabric inspected by safety third parties.
Cost to pack, and warehouse the goods overseas and domestically.
Cost to import goods into the US to be distributed ASAP.
Cost to cover any additional international packages such as the UK that require more funds to get there securely.
Cost for door-to-door delivery, from my forwarder to packing location.
Maybe one pizza while I write the labels out :o)
Lastly, the packaging and shipping to get them to your front door!
Here's a price breakdown!
50% goes to manufacturing (producing, safety checks)
30% goes to importing them (customs, freight shipping, forwarding)
10% goes to supplies and shipping (such as a boxes! tape! postage! yay!)
9% goes towards indigogo processing fees
1% goes to 10 pizzas, sodas, and chips, as bribery to friends that will:

Generate all names/addresses/etc on a shipping label
Print that label, stick it on a box
Put your fluffy goodness in the box
Tape the boxes up 
Help deiliver the boxes to UPS the same day its packed
Make sure everything is organized and stuff! :)
Make sure you have an awesome experience
Be very thankful for your awesomeness!
I'd like to clarify that this is not a flexible funding project, so either the project makes it or it doesn't. I did not want to flexible fund this as the funds would all directly going towards the project itself, and I didn't want to just run off with unused money that won't go towards the initial goal for its intended purposes.
Raffle Rules & Information:

Single $5 Pledge = 1 Raffle ticket
Multiple Raffle Pledges are Allowed
Make sure to share! The more raffle entrees, the more squishy's we can give out! I mean, come on.. who doesn't love the squishies? :D
As some folks have been asking:
For this project, Indiegogo will return your funds to you if the project is not successful. Only if it is successful, will they be fully withdrawn as a permanent method. Please contact me if you have any other questions!
Thank you :)",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Save water and energy</h3>
<p>We are Bridgiot (Your bridge to the Internet of things), a startup company that is part-owned by Stellenbosch University, and supported by MTN through the MTN Mobile Innovation Lab. </p>
<p>We have built a device, called Geasy,  for a research project on electrical water heaters (geysers). Geasy latches onto your existing geyser and provides various features that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Measuring water usage with break downs into events and costs</li>
<li>Measure energy usage and cost</li>
<li>Remote control of the geyser, including schedule and auto-schedule control. </li>
<li>Burst detection and mitigation. </li>
</ul>
<p>We already have over 100 Geasies installed, and are saving on average over R100 ($7) per unit per month just through scheduling. The geysers under our control have a peak load of almost 100 kW in the morning, and measures a combined 700 kWh and 14000 litres per day. </p>
<p>Have a look at <a href=""http://www.geasy.co.za"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.geasy.co.za</a> for more information. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are building this network, to save energy and to create awareness of water consumption. To do this, we want to raise our number of units in the field to over 1000, and in the process, establish the market need for such a device. </p>
<p>We are making available two types of Geasy, of which you can choose:</p>
<ul>
<li>A full-blown water-metering, burst mitigating, energy managing Geasy for R3000, and </li>
<li>A watered-down (excuse the pun) Geasy with only energy management for R2000.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The installation will be for your own cost</strong>, and you will have to arrange your own plumber. It takes between 30 minutes and 90 minutes to install, depending on the difficulty of the existing geyser. It takes even less if you are installing a new geyser anyway.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we get 1000 Geasies installed, we can save a daily total of 4 MWh of energy per day, we can also avoid peak loads of 1 MW every morning (saving Eskom some trouble), and finally save up to 50,000 litres of potable water per day through behavioural changes. As a cherry on top, we will prevent a significant amount of damages that may occur due to bursts. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We already have over 100 units running in houses, most of which have been working for over 6 months. We are still busy with our certification testing, and there is a risk that your insurer will not like you installing an uncertified device in your house. The process to resolution is underway.</p>
<p>Initially we will absorb the data costs for your device, after a year there is a small monthly charge to cover the mobile data used.</p>

be reached.</p><h4>2. Alerts your friends</h4><p>The friends you have listed in the Panica app will be notified when the alarm has been triggered, regardless where they are located. <br/></p><h4><b>3.

It will also give out a high-pitched alarming sound to alert nearby people and hopefully scare away any perpetuators.<br/></p><h4><b>5.

<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Personal security is about feeling safe</h2>There are many personal alarm apps on the market. However, none of them are connected to an online community. Also, you usually have to hold the phone in your hand in order to activate the alarm. This is an action that might not be possible in a number of situations. For example, if you are out running, you might not want to hold the phone in your hand. Not to consider that the phone might go into a sleep mode, which would require you to unlock the phone before calling for help.<br/><br/><p>With Panica we are trying to solve the problems the other alarms on the market have. We have not only made it easy to reach and used in stressful situations but also if the phone with the Panica app or the button/device would break the position of the alarm will still be stored in our servers and pushed out to friends and the online Panica community.</p><p>We aim to build a worldwide community of caring people. Together we can fight crime and help each other in panic situations. You should be able to use Panica regardless if you are at home with your family and friends nearby or if you are traveling abroad. We have decided to give out the Panica app to everyone for free. Even those who do not have the button can still help making the streets safer.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1083092/files/20141209035658-sprangskiss.jpg?1418126218"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>

A combination of a physical button and a free safety app



The button will come in a variety of colors, and eventually shapes, and can be worn in a necklace or bracelet.









Call for help with one click and the community hears you
Imagine people all over the world being able to help each other quickly when someone is in need. Using new technology and combining smart functionality, Panica makes it possible to call for help in many ways, instantly, with only one click. Anyone can download the Panica app for free. Whoever has the app 
installed is a part of the worldwide Panica community and can use the 
essential functions even without the Panica button. By combining sound, 
GPS location and notifications to both friends and the online community,
 you can reach out for help with one click.When activated, Panica:1. Alerts the Panica communityEveryone nearby with
 the Panica app will be notified when the alarm has been triggered. They will both see exactly where the alarm was triggered as well as getting a detailed road map on how to get there. Panica will also give easy access to emergency services if they need to 
be reached.2. Alerts your friendsThe friends you have listed in the Panica app will be notified when the alarm has been triggered, regardless where they are located. 3. Alerts the policeWhen the alarm has been triggered the phone will send a message to the alarm central with your whereabouts. 
4. Starts a highly visible flashing light signal and a high-pitched alarming sound
The app will use the built in flash/lamp in the phone to create a light beacon so people can more easily find the exact position if it is dark. It will also give out a high-pitched alarming sound to alert nearby people and hopefully scare away any perpetuators.5. Starts a recording of the eventSometimes it is good to have an event documented. Panica will start recording the event as soon as the alarm has been set off.
These are a few situations when Panica will come in handy:

The possibilities are here.Now let's use them for our loved ones safety


Personal security is about feeling safeThere are many personal alarm apps on the market. However, none of them are connected to an online community. Also, you usually have to hold the phone in your hand in order to activate the alarm. This is an action that might not be possible in a number of situations. For example, if you are out running, you might not want to hold the phone in your hand. Not to consider that the phone might go into a sleep mode, which would require you to unlock the phone before calling for help.With Panica we are trying to solve the problems the other alarms on the market have. We have not only made it easy to reach and used in stressful situations but also if the phone with the Panica app or the button/device would break the position of the alarm will still be stored in our servers and pushed out to friends and the online Panica community.We aim to build a worldwide community of caring people. Together we can fight crime and help each other in panic situations. You should be able to use Panica regardless if you are at home with your family and friends nearby or if you are traveling abroad. We have decided to give out the Panica app to everyone for free. Even those who do not have the button can still help making the streets safer. 
How Panica works? (for us who like tech stuff)Some of the key functionalities and features:
Possibility to create groups, such as: family members, friends, neighbors etc.
Offers both a loud and silent alarm functionality.
Triggers the alarm functionality by pressing the Panica button or the in-app button.
Send alarm notifications to nearby people in the online community as well as the group of people you have chosen forehand.
Offers a ""safe walk"" functionality that shares your location only with the ones you want to share it with.
Sends a text message with your exact location to someone you have chosen forehand.
Quick access to emergency services for both you and everyone that was notified.
Gives an automatic address lookup where the alarm was triggered.
Gives Instant directions to the exact location where alarm was triggered.
Panica is always ready to send an alarm when the Panica button is pressed, even if the application on the phone is closed.
(Even deeper technical specifications)
Push Notifications to both iOS and Android.
PHP backend

Third party SMS service to alert a contact person directly from the application when alarm is triggered.
Bluetooth LE to communicate with Panica accessories.
Using CoreLocation to show the accurate location for example when the Alarm is triggered or during Safe Walk.
JSON for efficient network communication.
SSL encrypted network traffic.
Keychain to securely store sensitive data.
Using Apple/Google maps to display location and directions.
Using Apple/Google reverse geocoding lookup street name.
Power efficient, using notifications when an event is triggered instead of polling.
Register for Bluetooth event to start the Panica application and take action even if the app is closed.
Ability to Play sound and blink LED during the alarm.
Quick access to telephone for emergency call using URL scheme.
Inside the buttonWe have worked very hard to make Panica look stylish as well as technically working exceptionally well. We have built the product with the newest standards in order to create a device that has a long lasting battery life. The Panica device will work for years with a standard battery, but we wanted it to be used much longer so we made it possible to change the battery as well. When the battery is draining power the app will notify you that it is time to change it.
Panica button is connected with the application using Bluetooth 4.0 to be used as a remote trigger when help is needed. Panica is not just a button, it communicates battery status and distance to your phone using highly integrated single-chip Bluetooth® low energy IC.

<p>At Nine Studios we're committed to giving you the product you want and we have far too many features we wanted to add into our devices. These are some that haven't made the initial cut but if there's any you particularly want to see let us know. We still have time to add these features if there are any you all really care about, especially if we exceed our funding goal. As a company we design smart home products so many of these features are to make Photine frames a wider part of the smart home, connecting with third party devices and services.</p>
<ul>
<li>iTunes Album Art - So the frame can monitor what your iTunes is playing on the computer and can display the currently playing album cover on one of the screens.</li>
<li>Music Visualiser - You may have seen the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPasoAx3z1c"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iTunes music visualiser</a> which displays moving colours and patterns in time with the music your playing. A very attractive display. What if we could get this type of functionality across the multiple displays on a Photine frame?</li>
<li>Online Setup - When you buy your Photine frame on our site what if you could configure what the frame will display before it arrives. Use our web portal to sign into your Facebook account, select the albums/people etc you want to show and then when you receive your frame, log in to the WiFi and off it goes. Great for getting as a present for someone, especially if they are less technically inclined.</li>
<li>Ambient Lighting - Lighting is a powerful emotional factor. Just ask the guys at <a href=""https://www.meethue.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Philips making the Hue colour changing light bulbs</a>. These are smart bulbs that can be controlled from a smart phone. Photine could integrate with these devices so you could set up ambient moods with just 1 button. Turn on the romantic setting and have the light bulbs dim down to a nice red shade whilst Photine starts playing a smooth visualiser motion like the iTunes visualiser mentioned above.</li>
<li>Smart home integration - We are getting more and more affordable smart home products. From WiFi speakers and doorbells to energy management and security. Photine can work with these products to provide extra functionality. Someone rings the WiFi doorbell and Photine displays a video feed of who is at the door.</li>

<p>Everyone has different tastes, different needs, different styles of homes and we know that we can't design a perfect digital photo frame for everyone. This is why we're creating an open hardware community at Nine Studios. Where we give manufacturers, designers, other companies and hobbyists access to our technology and allow them to buy sub assemblies of our products. So they can create their own unique frames using different materials, finishes or layouts. All without needing to know anything about electronics or software development. It can be as easy as making a one off wooden frame in your garage and fitting it to one of our sub assemblies, all the way through to mass production. This means that you as consumers get more choice with a Photine frame that fits in your home and with your own personal aesthetic. Please purchase our open hardware pledge if you are interested in joining this community or email c.jackson@ninestudios.com for more details.</p>

The first multiple screen digital photo frames
""Designed due to the frustration of all the dull, similar looking digital frames which are notoriously a hassle to use and regularly appear in the Christmas least wanted gifts lists. Our photos and memories deserve better as we struggle to find ways to display the ever increasing amount of photos we care about.""






Photine comes in a 1, 3 and 4 screen model. They are the first multiple screen digital photo frames made from Canadian maple with high quality LCD screens. They are a beautiful way to relive those best moments in life.




""The most innovative digital photo frame we've ever seen"" - Shell LiveWIRE UK
""[The] overall idea definitely seems to be impressive and in this digital world where we all are connected one way or the other, this idea can be a great success."" - Technospot.net
""Here we have the chance to re-create those memories, and bring all those photos we take constantly on our phones to life, and do it all while making it look beautiful"" - OxGadgets







Winner of the London Entrepreneurs Challenge (2013)


Winner of the UCL Bright Ideas Award (2013)


Shortlisted for the Shell LiveWIRE Grand Ideas Award (2013)

Shortlisted for the NACUE Varsity Pitch (2013)
Our founder, Charlie Jackson, is currently shortlisted for Britain's Top Real Role Model for his involvement in Nine Studios, the company behind Photine.





Photine frames connect to your WiFi and can download your images from the online services you use like Facebook, Dropbox, your computer libraries and more… Photine frames are smarter than most. With their smart albums they can automatically retrieve and display your latest photos with the most Facebook likes, comments, the ones you and your partner are tagged in and more.





Smart selection, instant, automatic and effortless.




Photine frames are set up via our mobile app or any web browser. Starting out is as simple as: 

Launching the app 
It discovers a new frame to set up 
Sign the frame into your WiFi 
Log into 1 or more online services like Facebook or Dropbox 
Your frame will now display your images.







Our app includes more features like pushing photos from your device to the frames, navigate between photos being displayed or send a photo to someone else's frame. Perfect for long distance couples. You can also have a party mode where you tell the app who is coming over and it will make sure your Photine frame will display pictures where your guests have all been at the same events before.



Digital photo frames catch up with the smart home




Having multiple screens allows Photine frames to do things no one else can do. Like display 1 image cut up over multiple displays or show panoramic images across our gorgeous 3 screen frame.



You could also assign each display of 1 frame to a different family member. So only their photos stream to that frame. Great when the kids have left home.




Feel more connected to your family




Photine frames have a contemporary design with a tiered construction. So some displays are raised above others. This dynamic offers a beautiful yet subtle contrast to the products.




Photine frames have been kept as simple as possible, with only a single domed button to turn the product on and off.







Pick specific albums and pictures to display rather than use smart albums. 
Photine stores the last 1000 images in its memory so you still have plenty of photos to display if your WiFi disconnects. 
Temporarily assign a display to a friend or family member. Great for when they are travelling and you get their holiday images displaying in real time back home. 
Support for: Facebook, Dropbox, iPhoto, Mac OSX, Windows, Flickr, Picasa, Google Drive and Instagram. 
On/off timer. Photine can automatically turn itself on and off according to the time. So you can set it to never display when you're asleep and wake you up with the latest images of your family.
No duplicates. If you have more than 1 Photine frame they can communicate with each other and make sure that the same photo doesn't appear on a different frame around the same time.












At Nine Studios we're committed to giving you the product you want and we have far too many features we wanted to add into our devices. These are some that haven't made the initial cut but if there's any you particularly want to see let us know. We still have time to add these features if there are any you all really care about, especially if we exceed our funding goal.

iTunes Album Art - So the frame can monitor what your iTunes is playing on the computer and can display the currently playing album cover on one of the screens.
Music Visualiser - You may have seen the iTunes music visualiser which displays moving colours and patterns in time with the music your playing. A very attractive display. What if we could get this type of functionality across the multiple displays on a Photine frame?
Online Setup - When you buy your Photine frame on our site what if you could configure what the frame will display before it arrives. Use our web portal to sign into your Facebook account, select the albums/people etc you want to show and then when you receive your frame, log in to the WiFi and off it goes. Great for getting as a present for someone, especially if they are less technically inclined.
Ambient Lighting - Lighting is a powerful emotional factor. Just ask the guys at Philips making the Hue colour changing light bulbs. These are smart bulbs that can be controlled from a smart phone. Photine could integrate with these devices so you could set up ambient moods with just 1 button. Turn on the romantic setting and have the light bulbs dim down to a nice red shade whilst Photine starts playing a smooth visualiser motion like the iTunes visualiser mentioned above.
Smart home integration - We are getting more and more affordable smart home products. From WiFi speakers and doorbells to energy management and security. Photine can work with these products to provide extra functionality. Someone rings the WiFi doorbell and Photine displays a video feed of who is at the door.

Our costs are extremely low; we've won free office space and have extremely low staff costs (as a young company our employees are here because they believe in our project and are rewarded with equity instead of using up the money you are giving us). 
We also have the capability to do it. We have a great team as mentioned above and fully believe in wider collaboration with the community. This is why we're launching our open hardware community. This is a journey we are all taking together, not just our team. We value your support and input as much as our own.


We want to use this Indiegogo campaign as an opportunity to find and accept help and advice for all of you. If you have any ideas, feedback or suggestions please get in contact with us. If you think you can help us make these products better, in a shorter time or even want to join our team as we bring these products to market and develop further smart home products get in touch as well. We're always on the lookout for talented individuals who want to join a high growth design and technology company.

Since I always struggled with chargers and cables lying everywhere, my first requirement for the table was to be able to wirelessly charge phones. Once there was the electricity supply in the table, the possibilities increased significantly.</p><p>The second idea was to display the weather. However, in today's time full of various digital displays everywhere, I wanted a different form of display. One that would not flicker at me annoyingly. After a long search for the right display method, drawing in the sand became the most elegant form that is extremely romantic while it also provides a huge display area that has immense possibilities of use. It displayed the weather, but that covered the potential of this device very minimally.</p><p>Eventually, I began to realize the possibilities.

All of this and more thanks to design, modern technology, and art, all combined into a unique table that brings you a new dimension of smart home and communication combined with relaxation and the experience of uniqueness. Let yourself be absorbed by the smooth movement of a ball in the sand. The ball can draw complex mandala ornaments as well as your own pictures on request. ZEUS Zeus has a beautiful robust design with a simple shelf for storing all your necessities. The most dominant design feature of this table is the base. It is made of two massive steel pieces that make the table slide on the carpet with ease. Zeus is the true god of all tables.Size: 36.4""x22.6""x18.7"" (925x575x475mm)Weight: approx. 110lb (50kg)Category: Premium HELIOS Helios will brighten up your home, just like the god of the Sun. Helios is also a robust table with a shelf and a base made of one welded steel piece which makes the table a really luxurious item.Size: 36.4""x22.6""x18.7"" (925x575x475mm)Weight: approx. 110lb (50kg)Category: Premium ARTEMIS Artemis has a very airy base formed by legs made of steel rods symbolizing three arrows belonging to Artemis, the goddess of the hunt. Its design is very versatile and it fits into almost any home.Size: 36.4""x22.6""x18.7"" (925x575x475mm)Weight: approx. 77lb (35kg)Category: Style KAIROS Kairos is a timeless classic. The base is made of four wooden legs with a slight incline emphasizing its stability. Kairos is the god of time and opportunity, just like this table is the perfect opportunity to make your home beautiful. Size: 36.4""x22.6""x18.7"" (925x575x475mm)Weight: approx. 77lb (35kg)Category: Style TYCHÉTyché has four legs made of steel which give the table a modern look. Tyche is a graceful goddess of fortune who undoubtedly used her power to make the GlyGlo project possible.Size: 36.4""x22.6""x18.7"" (925x575x475mm)Weight: approx. 77lb (35kg)Category: Style  I wanted a table that could charge my phone without having my chargers lying everywhere. I also wanted it to be able to tell me what the weather would be like and display my calendar notifications. All of this, without disturbing the harmony of the room with a large display. Then, I came across kinetic art and realized that this was it!This was the right way to get a table with all the features I wanted while keeping the design modern, smooth, and relaxing. During the development, we added even more smart features to our design. And that is how GlyGlo was created.

 
 I wanted to create a coffee table which would be interesting, useful and fun in terms of design. Since I always struggled with chargers and cables lying everywhere, my first requirement for the table was to be able to wirelessly charge phones. Once there was the electricity supply in the table, the possibilities increased significantly.The second idea was to display the weather. However, in today's time full of various digital displays everywhere, I wanted a different form of display. One that would not flicker at me annoyingly. After a long search for the right display method, drawing in the sand became the most elegant form that is extremely romantic while it also provides a huge display area that has immense possibilities of use. It displayed the weather, but that covered the potential of this device very minimally.Eventually, I began to realize the possibilities. We gradually added more features such as drawing pictures, sending messages, displaying calendar notifications, etc. New features will be gradually added as the community of users grows. The device can be updated online, so the table you get now can only do a few things compared to the device it will become in the future.

<p></p><p>Un jour d'août 2006 Nicolas
Frolin, lassé de perdre son temps à chercher les couvercles de ses boîtes
préférées, invente le concept de Boîte Étanche sans Couvercle. Sept ans et deux
brevets plus tard sort le TWIZZ, la première application de ce concept. Ce mug
étanche et isotherme sans couvercle (le tout premier !) a été inventé à la
Croix-Rousse, à Lyon, et est fabriqué en Savoie (à Belmont-Tramonet). neolid
choisit des fournisseurs et des partenaires de proximité dans un rayon de 150
kilomètres et assure ainsi la qualité et la sûreté de la fabrication française
!</p><p>Pour cette année 2014, neolid a
décidé de s’attaquer à un nouveau projet, celui de la BOX.</p><p><b><i>A little background:
</i></b></p><p><i>It was a day of august 2006 when Nicolas
Frolin, tired of wasting his time searching for the matching lids of his
favorites boxes, invented the Lidless Sealed Box concept. Seven years and two
patents later, the TWIZZ was released, the first real application of the
concept. This lidless, sealed and insulated travel mug (the very first one!)
was invented in Croix Rousse in the city of Lyon and is produced in the nearby
area of Savoie (Belmont-Tramonet). Neolid has chosen local providers and
partners in a surrounding of 150km around Lyon, to ensure the « made in
France » quality and reliability!</i></p><p>
<i>In 2014, Neolid has decided to take on a new project: the BOX.</i><br/></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><b>Qu’est-ce que la BOX ? </b></p><p>Eh bien c’est tout simplement une
lunch box ! Simplement avez-vous dit ?  Pas tout à fait. </p><p>En effet, la Box tout comme son
grand frère le TWIZZ (premier mug étanche sans couvercle), dispose d’un système
de fermeture innovant, sans couvercle, qui lui garantit une étanchéité
parfaite. Elle est dotée d’une membrane en silicone (1, repère sur le visuel)
qui s’ouvre et se referme d’une simple rotation de sa bague (2, repère sur le
visuel), à l’instar d’un diaphragme d’appareil photo. </p><p><b><i>What is the
BOX?</i></b></p><p><i>A simple lunch box is what it’s
all about! Not quite, actually.</i></p><p><i>Indeed the BOX, as its big brother
the TWIZZ (the first lidless sealed travel mug), includes an innovative lidless
closing system which ensures a complete seal. The BOX features a silicon
membrane (marked as 1 on the visual) which opens and closes thanks to a simple
twist of its ring (marked as 2 on the visual), just like the lens of a camera
would.</i></p><p>
</p><p><i>Not only is it sealed, this box is 100%
airtight, which lets you store food in it with no concerns of it going bad.  And thanks to a removable shell which acts as a
protection (marked as 3 on the visual), the BOX is insulated and makes it the perfect
container to enjoy warm and cold meals in any situation.</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/362745/files/20140211035927-BOX_avec_rep_res.jpg?1392119967"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>Pourquoi l’avoir inventée ? </b></p><p>Pour éviter de chercher le
couvercle ou pire, de le perdre. L’idée étant de faciliter la vie de
l’utilisateur en proposant un « couvercle », en l’occurrence une
membrane, directement incorporée à la lunch box. Ainsi, la présence de cette
membrane élimine à la fois toute perte de temps liée à la recherche du
couvercle et tout risque de perte, en assurant étanchéité et isothermie tout au
long de la durée de vie du produit.</p><p><b><i>Why create it ?</i></b></p><p><i>To avoid wasting time looking for the
matching lid or even losing it. The main idea is to facilitate the user’s life
by offering a « lid ». In other words, it is a membrane directly
embedded to the lunch box. Therefore, this special feature eliminates all risk
of searching or losing the appropriate lid and it ensures a perfect seal and
thermal isolation for the entire product shelf life.</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/362746/files/20140211040024-pourquoi_l_avoir_invent_e.jpg?1392120024"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>
<br/></p><p><b>Le concept du sans couvercle </b></p><p>Etonnant de simplicité et
d’ingéniosité, ce système breveté assure fermeture et étanchéité par
l’intermédiaire d’une membrane en torsion. Fixée en haut, sur une bague
amovible mais aussi  en bas, sur le corps
du produit, la membrane se vrille à mesure qu’on tourne la bague, sur le même
principe que la fermeture d’un ballon de baudruche.</p><p>Ce concept signé neolid a
désormais fait ses preuves par la commercialisation du TWIZZ, premier mug
étanche sans couvercle, sorti le 14 juillet 2013 et compte bien perdurer et

Un jour d'août 2006 Nicolas
Frolin, lassé de perdre son temps à chercher les couvercles de ses boîtes
préférées, invente le concept de Boîte Étanche sans Couvercle. Sept ans et deux
brevets plus tard sort le TWIZZ, la première application de ce concept. Ce mug
étanche et isotherme sans couvercle (le tout premier !) a été inventé à la
Croix-Rousse, à Lyon, et est fabriqué en Savoie (à Belmont-Tramonet). neolid
choisit des fournisseurs et des partenaires de proximité dans un rayon de 150
kilomètres et assure ainsi la qualité et la sûreté de la fabrication française
!Pour cette année 2014, neolid a
décidé de s’attaquer à un nouveau projet, celui de la BOX.A little background:
It was a day of august 2006 when Nicolas
Frolin, tired of wasting his time searching for the matching lids of his
favorites boxes, invented the Lidless Sealed Box concept. Seven years and two
patents later, the TWIZZ was released, the first real application of the
concept. This lidless, sealed and insulated travel mug (the very first one!)
was invented in Croix Rousse in the city of Lyon and is produced in the nearby
area of Savoie (Belmont-Tramonet). Neolid has chosen local providers and
partners in a surrounding of 150km around Lyon, to ensure the « made in
France » quality and reliability!
In 2014, Neolid has decided to take on a new project: the BOX.Qu’est-ce que la BOX ? Eh bien c’est tout simplement une
lunch box ! Simplement avez-vous dit ?  Pas tout à fait. En effet, la Box tout comme son
grand frère le TWIZZ (premier mug étanche sans couvercle), dispose d’un système
de fermeture innovant, sans couvercle, qui lui garantit une étanchéité
parfaite. Elle est dotée d’une membrane en silicone (1, repère sur le visuel)
qui s’ouvre et se referme d’une simple rotation de sa bague (2, repère sur le
visuel), à l’instar d’un diaphragme d’appareil photo. What is the
BOX?A simple lunch box is what it’s
all about! Not quite, actually.Indeed the BOX, as its big brother
the TWIZZ (the first lidless sealed travel mug), includes an innovative lidless
closing system which ensures a complete seal. The BOX features a silicon
membrane (marked as 1 on the visual) which opens and closes thanks to a simple
twist of its ring (marked as 2 on the visual), just like the lens of a camera
would.
Not only is it sealed, this box is 100%
airtight, which lets you store food in it with no concerns of it going bad.  And thanks to a removable shell which acts as a
protection (marked as 3 on the visual), the BOX is insulated and makes it the perfect
container to enjoy warm and cold meals in any situation.Pourquoi l’avoir inventée ? Pour éviter de chercher le
couvercle ou pire, de le perdre. L’idée étant de faciliter la vie de
l’utilisateur en proposant un « couvercle », en l’occurrence une
membrane, directement incorporée à la lunch box. Ainsi, la présence de cette
membrane élimine à la fois toute perte de temps liée à la recherche du
couvercle et tout risque de perte, en assurant étanchéité et isothermie tout au
long de la durée de vie du produit.Why create it ?To avoid wasting time looking for the
matching lid or even losing it. The main idea is to facilitate the user’s life
by offering a « lid ». In other words, it is a membrane directly
embedded to the lunch box. Therefore, this special feature eliminates all risk
of searching or losing the appropriate lid and it ensures a perfect seal and
thermal isolation for the entire product shelf life.
Le concept du sans couvercle Etonnant de simplicité et
d’ingéniosité, ce système breveté assure fermeture et étanchéité par
l’intermédiaire d’une membrane en torsion. Fixée en haut, sur une bague
amovible mais aussi  en bas, sur le corps
du produit, la membrane se vrille à mesure qu’on tourne la bague, sur le même
principe que la fermeture d’un ballon de baudruche.Ce concept signé neolid a
désormais fait ses preuves par la commercialisation du TWIZZ, premier mug
étanche sans couvercle, sorti le 14 juillet 2013 et compte bien perdurer et
être décliné à plusieurs types d’utilisations. 
Après la boisson, il est grand
temps de l’étendre à la nourriture…Tel est le grand défi de la BOX. The no lid conceptRemarkably
simple and clever, this patented system ensures closure and a perfect seal via
a twisted membrane. With its upper side attached to a plastic turning ring, and
its lower side attached to the mug itself, the membrane twists as you turn the
ring. This neolid
branded concept has already proven itself with the TWIZZ, released on the market
on July 14th 2013, and looks forward to even more successful uses. Already used for beverages, it is now
time to extend the concept to food… This is the big challenge of the BOX.Voici les modèles actuels du TWIZZ

We would like to add others such as Google Home, HomeKit and Invoke over time but this depends on your funding (see stretch goals).<br/><br/>We are using this campaign to help produce the ZLINK Hub.  Unlike other bloated hubs with multiple protocols we are only supporting two; Z-Wave for home control and WiFi for connection to the cloud, App and Alexa.  We are keeping it simple with the initial focus on in-home voice control of devices such as lighting, thermostats, and locks.  Over time, we will add more devices and a fully featured, Internet-based, remote experience.  Our target cost for the ZLINK Hub is under $20.00. <br/><br/>As ZLINK grows we will expand the system using small inexpensive Hubs and Servers, keeping the system modular and simple, never forcing you to buy more than you need.

We would like to add others such as Google Home, HomeKit and Invoke over time but this depends on your funding (see stretch goals).We are using this campaign to help produce the ZLINK Hub.  Unlike other bloated hubs with multiple protocols we are only supporting two; Z-Wave for home control and WiFi for connection to the cloud, App and Alexa.  We are keeping it simple with the initial focus on in-home voice control of devices such as lighting, thermostats, and locks.  Over time, we will add more devices and a fully featured, Internet-based, remote experience.  Our target cost for the ZLINK Hub is under $20.00. As ZLINK grows we will expand the system using small inexpensive Hubs and Servers, keeping the system modular and simple, never forcing you to buy more than you need. Of course, we will keep everything under one user experience.Because we have been heavily involved in the industry helping others bring products to market we have the know-how to source some of the best, least expensive end devices to complement the ZLINK Hub. We are starting with a few of the most popular; plug-in switch and dimmer and in-wall switch and dimmer and have included these fully featured, proven designs in some starter kits with the ZLINK Hub. We will use some of the campaign funds to help with the certifications and packaging required to bring these deals to you.Who is ZLINK?ZLINK, conceived and executed by industry experts with deep experience in Home Control, Building Management, and Independent Living, exists to bring to market high-value, innovative solutions that complement the existing field of Certified Z-Wave products. ZLINK will create new products when necessary to complete solutions and will bring new technologies and device types to market. To learn more please visit www.zlinkproducts.com What is the ZLINK Hub?ZLINK starts with the ZLINK Smart Home Hub. This super-affordable hub allows you to easily add voice control for devices like lighting, thermostats, door locks.  The heart of ZLINK is a revolutionary low-cost hub that is self-contained, powered by any USB power supply that allows you to voice control your home automation devices via Amazon Echo. Don’t let the compact USB form fool you- this device runs even when your computer is shut down, like any other smart hub. However, the ZLINK platform is expandable and super easy to set up, with no monthly bills!Swivel 180 degrees for flexible installationPlug-In AnywhereUSB 5V power supplyUSB behind TVUSB outletUSB on routerWill the ZLINK Smart Home Hub work with any Amazon Alexa device?Yes, for under $20, the ZLINK Smart Home Hub is meant to be a companion to any Alexa assistant and will give you voice control of your Z-Wave devices with whatever Amazon Echo product you purchase.  The ZLINK hub also works with smartphone apps and has a web application as well. ZLINK is more than just the hub!The ZLINK Smart Home Hub is the center of your smart home.  The ZLINK hub allows your Amazon Alexa to talk to and control your Z-Wave products.  We started with Z-Wave as it is the best home automation technology on the market. As ZLINK grows we will likely add other technologies such as Bluetooth (BLE and Mesh), where needed.  We started with Amazon Alexa as our first Smart Home Assistant but don’t plan to stop there. ZLINK is not just another hub and will expand to be unlike anything else.What is Z-Wave? What makes it the best?The best smart home products use a technology called Z-Wave. It is our choice, as Z-Wave offers over 2100 products from 600 companies. This gives you, the customer, a great selection and lowest price point for a whole host of devices. Z-Wave is safe, secure, robust, and the leading technology for home control products. Who else uses Z-Wave?Z-Wave is used by many of the top home automation and security companies, and more options are being added every day. ADT, AT&T, Verizon, SmartThings, WINK, and Ring Protect, and many more use Z-Wave products for their smart home solutions.What does ZLINK work with?Because it has the interoperability of Z-Wave technology the ZLINK hub will work with most certified Z-Wave devices*.

<br/><p>ROOT is a space-efficient, easy-to-use gardening system that can grow up to 16 vegetables, herbs or flowers. All you need to do is plug in and sync ROOT then add water, plants and nutrients. You’re ready to grow!</p>
<p>Have you ever harvested your own fresh produce before? Perhaps you've tried and were unsuccessful. Maybe you don't believe you have the space or time to grow anything. With ROOT you can now grow seamlessly without having to weed or water.</p>
<p>Nothing can compare to the fresh taste or health benefits of eating straight
from your own garden. ROOT will connect you with your food.</p>
<h3>ROOT allows you to grow in any environment</h3>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1024705/files/20141117193725-Indiegogo_Graphics_Artboard_40_copy.png?1416281845"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p><br/>ROOT contains an automated smart LED lighting and watering system that takes care of your plants for you. ROOT grows hydroponically – without soil. This means faster and more efficient plant growth without the mess. ROOT's sensors are integrated to adjust to lighting in your environment. Your plants will grow in small containers called ROOT Pods that hold your plants' roots in place. Additionally, our app will sync with your ROOT so you receive notifications and alerts when your ROOT needs water or nutrients.</p>

<h4>Syncs with your life</h4>
<p>The app allows you to control the light system - if you go to bed at 9PM, you can program ROOT to sleep with you. Our app also syncs with ROOT's sensors to remind you when water or nutrients are running low.</p>

<p><br/>Our organically grown produce guarantees quality and taste unmatched by what's found in a grocery store. Harvesting straight from the plant provides you the <b>easiest access to the freshest produce</b> Hydroponic growing has traditionally utilized chemically derived substrates and nutrients - but we have all natural solutions. Your produce will provide <b>maximum nutrient content</b>, all within arms reach! Additionally, by growing your own you are reducing your environmental impact.</p>
<h3>Our mission is to connect people to their food sources.</h3>
<p>Everyone needs to eat, and Ohneka Farms believes that <b>access to fresh produce is a fundamental right</b>. We've been working with communities to jump start urban gardens in food deserts where people do not have direct access to organic produce. In particular. We are working with the <b>EVOLVE Foundation</b> to apply our technology to hydroponic gardens in Philadelphia food deserts. </p><p>We want to create sustainable solutions that allow people to grow their own produce, fostering deeper connections with food and bringing families and communities together.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1039998/files/20141123082915-Social_Impact-01.jpg?1416760155"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We want to increase everyone's access to organic produce and attack systemic food issues. A lack of space, light or growing knowledge should not prevent anyone from growing. We created our own solution to organic growing because we were tired of inefficient growing alternatives and poorly designed consumer products.</p>
<h4>Ecology is the design.</h4>
<p>We are implementing a <b>""Cradle to Cradle""</b> approach to our design and manufacturing processes. This means we have committed to using socially-minded, sustainable methods to support waste-free, regenerative systems during all stages of the product lifecycle.</p>

<p><br/>We are creating products that <b>establish lifelong connections</b> between people and their food. From simple pruning to transplanting, ROOT is great for novice and expert gardeners alike. We have worked directly with individuals in the R&amp;D phase to ensure we can meet a user's personal growing needs. </p>
<p>Americans throw away an estimated 64% of produce in this country. This waste plagues every step of the supply chain – from farmers discarding blemished produce to retail stores overstocking product displays to end consumers tossing away uneaten food.</p>

<h4>Our story</h4>
<p>Founders Eric and Brielle met in the Integrated Product Design Masters program at The University of Pennsylvania. The two were both interested in urban agricultural design and decided to join forces to continue their lifelong passion for growing. After school, they built an organic microfarm together where they currently test their organic permaculture growing methodologies. Tired of devising workarounds to inefficient growing systems, they designed their own solution. They have built out an interdisciplinary team whose skill sets and backgrounds entwine technology, biology and art to make ecology the focus of our smart design.</p>

<h3>
<br/>What are the next steps &amp; challenges?</h3>
<p>We have been working on ROOT for more than three years, researching
and developing the technology and performing user testing. We worked with novice and expert gardeners, researchers and physicians to improve our product. Our next step is to
get our prototype ready for production.  Our product is now patent pending, and we have been working with our engineers and manufacturing partners to refine the design for production.</p>

<p><br/><b>Manufacturing: </b></p>
<p>We need to create the tooling to manufacture the body of ROOT. This process is complex and requires both time and money. Complications
could potentially emerge and delay the manufacturing schedule. We are working with experienced partners who can work closely with us through the whole
process. Our goal is to make the best possible product for you and deliver it to you on time.</p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<p><b>What is hydroponic gardening?</b></p>
<p>Hydroponic gardening is a form of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions in water without soil. This ensures that plants receive nutrients directly into their roots. Using a controlled environment, plants receive the proper care that allows them to grow efficiently.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1019713/files/20141116103556-Indiegogo_Graphics_Artboard_8.jpg?1416162956"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p><b>How much power does ROOT consume?</b></p>
<p>ROOT consumes 40 watts of power - the equivalent of just one standard incandescent lightbulb!</p>
<p><b>What is Cradle to Cradle manufacturing?</b></p>
<p>""Cradle to Cradle"" is a term used in product development to describe manufacturing processes that are essentially waste free. This process mimics nature in the sense that all material inputs and outputs are seen as ""nutrients."" The nutrients can be recycled or reused with no loss of quality to the material input. Those nutrients go back into the stream.</p>

</ul>
<p><b>Why are LEDs used?</b></p>
<p>LEDs are more efficient and use less energy than standard grow lights. Traditional growing lights produce light that flows in every direction, wasting light energy and dissipating a large amount of heat. LEDs focus specific wavelengths of lights that can be readily absorbed by plants, minimizing the amount of energy required to supply proper lighting. Fewer resources are used in LED manufacturing, which does not use mercury or lead.</p>

<p><b>Will ROOT come in different colors?</b></p>
<p>We are currently focusing our efforts in manufacturing setup costs and tooling. Therefore, we will initially launch ROOT in an undyed, light grey plastic.</p>
<p><b>Is it safe to consume foods grown in recycled plastic?</b></p>
<p>Yes, recycled Polypropylene plastics are safe for growing your plants. Many conventional farms grow food using this material.

ROOT is a space-efficient, easy-to-use gardening system that can grow up to 16 vegetables, herbs or flowers. All you need to do is plug in and sync ROOT then add water, plants and nutrients. You’re ready to grow!
Have you ever harvested your own fresh produce before? Perhaps you've tried and were unsuccessful. Maybe you don't believe you have the space or time to grow anything. With ROOT you can now grow seamlessly without having to weed or water.
Nothing can compare to the fresh taste or health benefits of eating straight
from your own garden. ROOT will connect you with your food.
ROOT allows you to grow in any environment

ROOT contains an automated smart LED lighting and watering system that takes care of your plants for you. ROOT grows hydroponically – without soil. This means faster and more efficient plant growth without the mess. ROOT's sensors are integrated to adjust to lighting in your environment. Your plants will grow in small containers called ROOT Pods that hold your plants' roots in place. Additionally, our app will sync with your ROOT so you receive notifications and alerts when your ROOT needs water or nutrients.

Syncs with your life
The app allows you to control the light system - if you go to bed at 9PM, you can program ROOT to sleep with you. Our app also syncs with ROOT's sensors to remind you when water or nutrients are running low.


What can I grow?
ROOT will grow a variety of plants, vegetables and herbs.



Lettuce: Watercress, Romaine, Butter, Boston

Leafy Greens: Swiss Chard, Kale, Mustard Greens

Leafy Herbs: Basil, Cilantro, Parsley, Mint

Woody Herbs: Rosemary, Thyme, Oregano

Vine Plants: Cherry & Grape Tomatoes, Small Hot Peppers

Edible Flowers: Chamomile, Wild Flowers 

From our farm to yours
We will be offering ROOT Shares – a seedling subscription service that allows you to jump-start your gardening. These kits will include all your favorite varieties in addition to rare heirloom and organic specialties.

Why grow your own?

Our organically grown produce guarantees quality and taste unmatched by what's found in a grocery store. Harvesting straight from the plant provides you the easiest access to the freshest produce Hydroponic growing has traditionally utilized chemically derived substrates and nutrients - but we have all natural solutions. Your produce will provide maximum nutrient content, all within arms reach! Additionally, by growing your own you are reducing your environmental impact.
Our mission is to connect people to their food sources.
Everyone needs to eat, and Ohneka Farms believes that access to fresh produce is a fundamental right. We've been working with communities to jump start urban gardens in food deserts where people do not have direct access to organic produce. In particular. We are working with the EVOLVE Foundation to apply our technology to hydroponic gardens in Philadelphia food deserts. We want to create sustainable solutions that allow people to grow their own produce, fostering deeper connections with food and bringing families and communities together.
We want to increase everyone's access to organic produce and attack systemic food issues. A lack of space, light or growing knowledge should not prevent anyone from growing. We created our own solution to organic growing because we were tired of inefficient growing alternatives and poorly designed consumer products.
Ecology is the design.
We are implementing a ""Cradle to Cradle"" approach to our design and manufacturing processes. This means we have committed to using socially-minded, sustainable methods to support waste-free, regenerative systems during all stages of the product lifecycle.

Designed with you in mind

We are creating products that establish lifelong connections between people and their food. From simple pruning to transplanting, ROOT is great for novice and expert gardeners alike. We have worked directly with individuals in the R&D phase to ensure we can meet a user's personal growing needs. 
Americans throw away an estimated 64% of produce in this country. This waste plagues every step of the supply chain – from farmers discarding blemished produce to retail stores overstocking product displays to end consumers tossing away uneaten food.

Our story
Founders Eric and Brielle met in the Integrated Product Design Masters program at The University of Pennsylvania. The two were both interested in urban agricultural design and decided to join forces to continue their lifelong passion for growing. After school, they built an organic microfarm together where they currently test their organic permaculture growing methodologies. Tired of devising workarounds to inefficient growing systems, they designed their own solution. They have built out an interdisciplinary team whose skill sets and backgrounds entwine technology, biology and art to make ecology the focus of our smart design.


What are the next steps & challenges?
We have been working on ROOT for more than three years, researching
and developing the technology and performing user testing. We worked with novice and expert gardeners, researchers and physicians to improve our product. Our next step is to
get our prototype ready for production.  Our product is now patent pending, and we have been working with our engineers and manufacturing partners to refine the design for production.

Manufacturing: 
We need to create the tooling to manufacture the body of ROOT. This process is complex and requires both time and money. Complications
could potentially emerge and delay the manufacturing schedule. We are working with experienced partners who can work closely with us through the whole
process. Our goal is to make the best possible product for you and deliver it to you on time.
FAQ
What is hydroponic gardening?
Hydroponic gardening is a form of growing plants using mineral nutrient solutions in water without soil. This ensures that plants receive nutrients directly into their roots. Using a controlled environment, plants receive the proper care that allows them to grow efficiently.

How much power does ROOT consume?
ROOT consumes 40 watts of power - the equivalent of just one standard incandescent lightbulb!
What is Cradle to Cradle manufacturing?
""Cradle to Cradle"" is a term used in product development to describe manufacturing processes that are essentially waste free. This process mimics nature in the sense that all material inputs and outputs are seen as ""nutrients."" The nutrients can be recycled or reused with no loss of quality to the material input. Those nutrients go back into the stream.

<h2>What is a FastFlow Lid?</h2>
<p>The FastFlow Lid is a disposable cup lid for runners that allows them to drink quickly and easily without slowing, choking, or spilling.  Just like the name suggests - it flows fast.</p>

<h2>Why do you need a FastFlow Lid?</h2>
<p>Or maybe we should ask, ""Why wouldn't you want a FastFlow Lid?""  Unless you really like spilling sports drinks on your shirt, up your nose, or in your eyes, you'll absolutely love this new product.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/020/890/716428fb1514a7d25430e7c84b3fa400_large.jpg?1339114905"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The runners that have used the FastFlow Lids rave about them.  Their biggest disappointment is that the lids are not yet provided in all their races.  Many runners said they don't want to run another race without them.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/018/066/e3a077eb0c5e5092ea1179108c2b4527_large.jpg?1338938760"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The FastFlow Lids aren't just useful for running.  They're great for any cold drink on the go - soft drinks, milk shakes, frozen drinks, etc. </p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/018/073/9b132cbc06eec68a56af2324379a204e_large.jpg?1338938813"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<p>The FastFlow Lid is great for people of all ages - from young to old, and everyone in between.  Why?  Because it makes drinking easier, especially when you're on the move.  Consider the following times where this lid would also help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Movie Theaters</li>
<li>Sports Arenas</li>
<li>Fast Food Restaurants</li>
<li>Zoos</li>
<li>Amusement Parks</li>
<li>Cafeterias</li>
</ul><p>FastFlow Lids can easily replace all slotted lids with straws.  This evolution in the disposable cold drink cup lid will reduce waste and lower the cost since straws are no longer needed.  That's better for the environment and it's better for the user because it's just easier to drink with the FastFlow Lid than it is to suck through a straw.  If you don't believe us, just try it with your next smoothie.</p>
<div>
<h2>Help us help you!</h2>
<p>In order to produce the lids at an affordable price, we need to use production tooling that is much larger than the four-cavity tool we have used so far.   With enough help, we'll be able to fulfill orders for larger races, and you can start demanding the FastFlow Lids at all of your upcoming races.</p>

<p>This lid design has a <strong>patent pending</strong>.  Since there really isn't any other lid on the market that works like the FastFlow Lid, you won't be able to get anything like it without us bringing it to you.  But, we'll need your help to get this product into your race(s).  If you will help us get this project off the ground and running, we'll help you enjoy running events a little more by making the task of hydrating enjoyable once again.</p>
<h2>What others are saying about FastFlow Lids</h2>
<p>FastFlow Lids have been very well-received.  Those that have only seen them love the concept.  And those who have used them want to use them in their next race.  Here's just a small sampling of what people are saying:</p>
<ul>
<li>""They were AWESOME!...Can't wait to see them at more races!"" - Meg D.</li>
<li>""This is a great product, and I hope it catches on with more races.  It’s a lot better than crossing the finish line a drooly mess."" - Matt R.</li>
<li>“I’m not even a marathoner, and I want to use this.” - Rex W.</li>
<li>“This would benefit everyone – car trips, parties, sports events, hospitals, etc.” - Susan A.</li>

<h2>Make Your Race Stand Out with FastFlow Lids</h2>
<p>RunTheBluegrass Half Marathon in Lexington, Kentucky (a beautiful course, by the way) was the first organized race to use the FastFlow Lids.  They purchased 3,000 lids, which was enough for two of their eleven hydration stations.</p>
<p>Race organizers of RunTheBluegrass saw such a benefit from providing these lids to their runners that they committed to order more for their next race.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><a href=""http://www.runthebluegrass.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Click the image to visit RunTheBluegrass Half Marathon website""><img alt=""Click the image above to visit RunTheBluegrass Half Marathon website"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/018/096/e23a32ceac29463fa30a9502ddeb6f6f_large.jpg?1338939237"" src="""" style=""""/></a></div>
<p>Be the first race in your state to provide FastFlow Lids to your runners at <strong>every </strong>hydration station.  You'll be glad you did it.</p>
<p>At the race expo before the RunTheBluegrass Half Marathon, we showed hundreds of runners the FastFlow Lids and told them they were ""lids that allowed a runner to drink easily and quickly without slowing or spilling.""  On average, the runners we surveyed were willing to pay $3.40 more for their race fees if the race offered the lids at all hydrations stations.</p>
<p>After the race, we surveyed runners again.  The increase in race fees they were willing to pay went up to $7.40 on average.  So what does this mean?  The customer value clearly exceeds the cost, and the lids will not only pay for themselves, they'll also make your race more desirable.</p>
<h2>FAQ's</h2>
<h3><strong>Are FastFlow Lids recyclable?</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Yes, they are 100% recyclable.  The lids are made from food-grade polystyrene plastic and use recycling number 6.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Why are the FastFlow Lids produced in two different colors?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The white lids are used to indicate water is in the cup, while the black lids indicate that a sports drink is in the cup.  These colors can be seen from a distance, which informs runners well in advance what type of liquid they are getting at the hydration station.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Won't FastFlow Lids just cause more waste?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Our experience has shown that these lids actually cause <strong>less </strong>waste.  Because there are no splashes or spills, runners that typically take multiple cups at hydration stations will now only need to grab one cup.  The runners can hydrate well with one cup since they’re not spilling any of the liquid all over the front of their shirts.  This results in less cups needed at each hydration station, and therefore less water or sports drink that would have otherwise ended up on the road.  Furthermore, the lids can and should be fully recycled.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Are there different styles of lids?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes, there are two different FastFlow Lid designs.  The version featured in this Indiegogo project uses a unique venting system that prevents liquid from splashing in the face of the user.  As shown in a picture above, the vent is located under the rim of the lid.  This venting system is best suited for runners.  The second FastFlow Lid design has a vent through the top of the lid.  This particular design may be better suited for the consumer market.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What cup size does the FastFlow Lid fit?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The FastFlow Lid is designed to fit the Gatorade brand 12 oz. cold cup (made by Solo Cup).  FastFlow Lids should fit any standard 12 oz. paper cold cup, but if you’re not using the 12 oz. Gatorade cup, we suggest that before buying all of your cups you test the fit with the specific cup first.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Won't this take more time for volunteers to put lids on cups at races?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes, it will take just a little more time for hydration station volunteers to put lids on cups, but not much more.  Volunteers want to help and are willing to do more if it benefits the runners.  So, if volunteers start preparing cups and lids just a little earlier, they will be ready to go when the runners arrive.  Alternatively, adding an extra volunteer or two at the station will also do the trick.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Can cups with FastFlow Lids be stacked on top of each other for large races?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Yes, cups with FastFlow Lids can be stacked in several layers with a thin supporting material (such as cardboard or poster board) used between layers.  There is a clip in the video above showing cups and lids stacked on a hydration station table.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>What other benefits do FastFlow Lids offer runners?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>FastFlow Lids reduce congestion at hydration stations because they make the drink handoff quick and easy.  This allows runners to save precious time.  The more congested and slippery a hydration station is, the more likely an accident will occur.  However, FastFlow Lids prevent spills in the handoff and while drinking on the run, and prevent the road from becoming wet and slippery, or even icy.</li>
<li>Another benefit of the FastFlow Lids is that they keep contaminants (bugs, leaves, dirt, etc.) out of the drink before they're handed to the runners.  They also keep hydration station workers’ fingers out of the drink.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Why would I want to incur the cost of having FastFlow Lids in my race?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Runners that have used FastFlow Lids absolutely love them.  In fact, runners are asking for them in other races.  Based on runner survey results, races can raise their fees at least $5 if they communicate that they will provide FastFlow Lids at all their hydration stations.  Providing FastFlow Lids is a great way to attract more runners while also increasing race proceeds.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><strong>Who are the company founders?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Wade Powell</strong> and <strong>Geoff Carlson</strong> are the co-founders of <strong>Cornerstone Innovations, LLC</strong> - a company committed to developing products that make life easier.</li>
<li>
<strong>Wade</strong> has 17 years of product development experience and has worked at various consumer electronics and medical device companies. Wade holds a bachelors degree in mechanical engineering from Utah State University and a masters degree in Engineering Management from Stanford University.</li>
<li>
<strong>Geoff</strong> has 12 years of experience in the consumer electronics industry. Geoff holds bachelors and masters degrees in mechanical engineering from Brigham Young University.</li>
<li>With more than a dozen patents to our name, and others pending, we are passionate about creating value for the customer through innovative, yet elegantly simple, solutions. We both have had a life-long fascination with product development and spend much of our spare time developing products that solve common, everyday problems.</li>

Sports Arenas
Fast Food Restaurants
Zoos
Amusement Parks
Cafeterias
FastFlow Lids can easily replace all slotted lids with straws.  This evolution in the disposable cold drink cup lid will reduce waste and lower the cost since straws are no longer needed.  That's better for the environment and it's better for the user because it's just easier to drink with the FastFlow Lid than it is to suck through a straw.  If you don't believe us, just try it with your next smoothie.

Help us help you!
In order to produce the lids at an affordable price, we need to use production tooling that is much larger than the four-cavity tool we have used so far.   With enough help, we'll be able to fulfill orders for larger races, and you can start demanding the FastFlow Lids at all of your upcoming races.

This lid design has a patent pending.  Since there really isn't any other lid on the market that works like the FastFlow Lid, you won't be able to get anything like it without us bringing it to you.  But, we'll need your help to get this product into your race(s).  If you will help us get this project off the ground and running, we'll help you enjoy running events a little more by making the task of hydrating enjoyable once again.
What others are saying about FastFlow Lids
FastFlow Lids have been very well-received.  Those that have only seen them love the concept.  And those who have used them want to use them in their next race.  Here's just a small sampling of what people are saying:

""They were AWESOME!...Can't wait to see them at more races!"" - Meg D.
""This is a great product, and I hope it catches on with more races.  It’s a lot better than crossing the finish line a drooly mess."" - Matt R.
“I’m not even a marathoner, and I want to use this.” - Rex W.
“This would benefit everyone – car trips, parties, sports events, hospitals, etc.” - Susan A.

The FastFlow Lid product concept was also chosen (by judges and the audience) as the first 2012 winner of the 5across competition, an innovative pitch contest for entrepreneurs.

We're anxious to get this product into your hands so you can experience them for yourself.  This Indiegogo project is your opportunity to make that happen.
Perks
Perks are what we give you when you choose to fund our project.  We are offering two different types of perks.  The first is black and/or white FastFlow Lids.

The second type of perk is the one-of-a-kind decal – “26.21875 - Because it's not a marathon until you conquer the last 99 feet!™”.  Did you know that 26.2 miles is not a complete marathon?  The official distance is 26.2 miles plus 99 feet, which is exactly 26.21875 miles.  Often the last 99 feet is the hardest part of the marathon.  Click on the decal picture below to see Wade conquer his last 99 feet in an attempt to qualify for the Boston Marathon.

We are offering two types of perk categories with the following perk levels:

FastFlow Lids (Estimated Delivery - Dec. 2012)

$15 – 10 white or black lids (or any ratio)
$20 – 10 white & 10 black lids

Thank you for supporting the FastFlow Lid project.  This project would not be possible without you.
Make Your Race Stand Out with FastFlow Lids
RunTheBluegrass Half Marathon in Lexington, Kentucky (a beautiful course, by the way) was the first organized race to use the FastFlow Lids.  They purchased 3,000 lids, which was enough for two of their eleven hydration stations.
Race organizers of RunTheBluegrass saw such a benefit from providing these lids to their runners that they committed to order more for their next race.

Be the first race in your state to provide FastFlow Lids to your runners at every hydration station.  You'll be glad you did it.
At the race expo before the RunTheBluegrass Half Marathon, we showed hundreds of runners the FastFlow Lids and told them they were ""lids that allowed a runner to drink easily and quickly without slowing or spilling.""  On average, the runners we surveyed were willing to pay $3.40 more for their race fees if the race offered the lids at all hydrations stations.
After the race, we surveyed runners again.  The increase in race fees they were willing to pay went up to $7.40 on average.  So what does this mean?  The customer value clearly exceeds the cost, and the lids will not only pay for themselves, they'll also make your race more desirable.
FAQ's
Are FastFlow Lids recyclable?



Yes, they are 100% recyclable.  The lids are made from food-grade polystyrene plastic and use recycling number 6.

Why are the FastFlow Lids produced in two different colors?

The white lids are used to indicate water is in the cup, while the black lids indicate that a sports drink is in the cup.  These colors can be seen from a distance, which informs runners well in advance what type of liquid they are getting at the hydration station.

Won't FastFlow Lids just cause more waste?

Our experience has shown that these lids actually cause less waste.  Because there are no splashes or spills, runners that typically take multiple cups at hydration stations will now only need to grab one cup.  The runners can hydrate well with one cup since they’re not spilling any of the liquid all over the front of their shirts.  This results in less cups needed at each hydration station, and therefore less water or sports drink that would have otherwise ended up on the road.  Furthermore, the lids can and should be fully recycled.

Are there different styles of lids?

Yes, there are two different FastFlow Lid designs.  The version featured in this Indiegogo project uses a unique venting system that prevents liquid from splashing in the face of the user.  As shown in a picture above, the vent is located under the rim of the lid.  This venting system is best suited for runners.  The second FastFlow Lid design has a vent through the top of the lid.  This particular design may be better suited for the consumer market.

What cup size does the FastFlow Lid fit?

The FastFlow Lid is designed to fit the Gatorade brand 12 oz. cold cup (made by Solo Cup).  FastFlow Lids should fit any standard 12 oz. paper cold cup, but if you’re not using the 12 oz. Gatorade cup, we suggest that before buying all of your cups you test the fit with the specific cup first.

Won't this take more time for volunteers to put lids on cups at races?

Yes, it will take just a little more time for hydration station volunteers to put lids on cups, but not much more.  Volunteers want to help and are willing to do more if it benefits the runners.  So, if volunteers start preparing cups and lids just a little earlier, they will be ready to go when the runners arrive.  Alternatively, adding an extra volunteer or two at the station will also do the trick.

Can cups with FastFlow Lids be stacked on top of each other for large races?

Yes, cups with FastFlow Lids can be stacked in several layers with a thin supporting material (such as cardboard or poster board) used between layers.  There is a clip in the video above showing cups and lids stacked on a hydration station table.

What other benefits do FastFlow Lids offer runners?

FastFlow Lids reduce congestion at hydration stations because they make the drink handoff quick and easy.  This allows runners to save precious time.  The more congested and slippery a hydration station is, the more likely an accident will occur.  However, FastFlow Lids prevent spills in the handoff and while drinking on the run, and prevent the road from becoming wet and slippery, or even icy.
Another benefit of the FastFlow Lids is that they keep contaminants (bugs, leaves, dirt, etc.) out of the drink before they're handed to the runners.  They also keep hydration station workers’ fingers out of the drink.

Why would I want to incur the cost of having FastFlow Lids in my race?

Runners that have used FastFlow Lids absolutely love them.  In fact, runners are asking for them in other races.  Based on runner survey results, races can raise their fees at least $5 if they communicate that they will provide FastFlow Lids at all their hydration stations.  Providing FastFlow Lids is a great way to attract more runners while also increasing race proceeds.

<h3>What Makes the Stray No More Pet Barrier Different?</h3>
<p>Our patent-pending design was created by Tammy Ven Dange, the former CEO of an animal shelter in Canberra, Australia.  After seeing thousands of stray animals come through the shelter every year, she knew that there was a problem.  Yet there were few products on the market that were made specifically to help owners keep their pets from escaping their home or yard.</p>
<p>So, she created the Stray No More product line to do this.  Furthermore, she wanted to help the environment at the same time.  Therefore, all of the Stray No More products are made from nearly 100% Australian recycled plastics and manufactured in Australia.</p>
<p>The Stray No More pet barrier is unique in its versatility, expandability and retractability - making this barrier useful for any pet-owner or someone that may have pet visitors regardless of whether you own a home or are renting.</p>

<p>Depending on the layout of your house, simply <strong>measure the space from A to B <u>with</u> the door open</strong>.  Then, give yourself an extra 25 centimeters of panels minimum to ensure that the barrier can stand on its own and isn't reliant on the walls to hold its form and weight.</p>

<p>As a pet owner, you'd appreciate the fact that every animal is different.  Even pets from the same litter have different personalities just like kids.  The pet barrier is meant to act as a deterrent to keep animals from escaping when  a door is opened or to prevent them from entering/exiting a space.</p>
<p>And while it has worked on all the animals we have tested this prototype on so far, it's not to say that it will work with yours if it decides to jump over the barrier or pull it out of the wall.  We just can't make that kind of guarantee. What we have found though is that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Most pets hesitate to jump over something when they cannot see the other side (i.e. our no-peak panels);</li>
<li>The barrier will move if a pet tries to jump on it, and they usually back away when that happens;</li>
<li>Because each panel weights about 1 kilo each, they haven't been able to get under it very easily;</li>
<li>The pet will tend to look at the human when they can't find an exit or see what's on the other side.</li>
<li>If the human leaves quickly, they get bored with the barrier quickly too.</li>

<p><strong>PRODUCT DELIVERY</strong></p>
<p>While our products will be made in Australia, the 6 tonnes of steel moulds will be made in China.  As such, our schedule will be impacted by their long Chinese New Year shut-down period in the January/February 2020 time frame.  With this in mind, we have forecasted a March 2020 delivery schedule for this product.</p>

There were many times when we purchased a beautiful plant and for the first few days we watered it regularly (sometimes we even overdid it ;) However, as the weeks went by we devoted less and less attention to our plant, so it withered away and in the end we threw it away.

We're so excited to have you try out our brand-new celebration box concept. Posted Party is not profitable - so we are offering our boxes at the lowest price we can, while still sourcing all of the contents at lower quantities. We hope to scale to higher volumes in the future as we build out this business - and lower our prices in the process.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Help us bring this advanced innovative, multi-function upgrade of the pooper scooper, to all pet owners who dread using their hands to pick up their pets deposits.</p>
<h2><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></h2>
<p>The latest innovation in pooper scooper design. Pooper scoopers have not evolved over the years and we still use our hands for the most expedient way to collect the deposits, but it is also the most unsanitary and unpleasant way too. With Bleu Paw we took out the unpleasantness and copied how you use your hand to provide a device that replaces your hand. You slide your hand inside a bag &amp; you slide Bleu Paw inside a bag,  but instead of bending down,  you reach down to pickup poop.  In a comfortable posture that puts no stress on your back.</p>
<h3><strong> Time To Upgrade How You Pick Up POOP!</strong></h3>
<p>Nothing ruins a great trip with our pets to the beach, campgrounds or the park until you run out of bags &amp; have to pick up with your hands the unpleasant deposits they leave. One bag with Bleu Paw is all you need just stack all of your dogs  poop for the day into the huge claws and lock them closed until you need to collect more then discard one bag with all of your pets poop together. </p>
<p>Yeah it’s unpleasant, but we have to pick it up.</p>
<p>After picking up countless piles and even having a few bags break my partner and I knew there has to be a better more efficient, sanitary way to pickup pets poop. So we said why not design one with all the features we would expect the perfect pooper scooper to have.</p>
<h2><strong>Meet Bleu Paw XL</strong></h2>

</div></div>","Help us bring this advanced innovative, multi-function upgrade of the pooper scooper, to all pet owners who dread using their hands to pick up their pets deposits.
OVERVIEW
The latest innovation in pooper scooper design. Pooper scoopers have not evolved over the years and we still use our hands for the most expedient way to collect the deposits, but it is also the most unsanitary and unpleasant way too. With Bleu Paw we took out the unpleasantness and copied how you use your hand to provide a device that replaces your hand. You slide your hand inside a bag & you slide Bleu Paw inside a bag,  but instead of bending down,  you reach down to pickup poop.  In a comfortable posture that puts no stress on your back.
 Time To Upgrade How You Pick Up POOP!
Nothing ruins a great trip with our pets to the beach, campgrounds or the park until you run out of bags & have to pick up with your hands the unpleasant deposits they leave. One bag with Bleu Paw is all you need just stack all of your dogs  poop for the day into the huge claws and lock them closed until you need to collect more then discard one bag with all of your pets poop together. 
Yeah it’s unpleasant, but we have to pick it up.
After picking up countless piles and even having a few bags break my partner and I knew there has to be a better more efficient, sanitary way to pickup pets poop. So we said why not design one with all the features we would expect the perfect pooper scooper to have.
Meet Bleu Paw XL


For the last year, we worked on finding materials to make sure it’s a high quality, durable, functioning device packed with all the important features that will make it necessity while walking your dog.
Bulky, Long Pooper Scoopers Are OUT!
They make carrying them impossible and unsanitary. Bleu Paw Changes all that.

<h3>A Short Summary</h3>
<p>Let's face it!  We throw a tremendous amount of perfectly good wood into landfills.  We've all seen it.  Drive by a construction or demolition site, and you can see that there is enough lumber in the dumpster to build a small house!   </p>
<p>""Wood doesn't grow on trees.""</p>
<p>I wrote that slogan to make people think about the fantastic resource we glean from trees.  It's a little tongue in cheek at first glance, but let's take it a step further.  Wood is a finite resource; demand can (and will) outstrip supply, but every single day someone is bulldozing entire old houses into landfills because it's just ""more cost-effective.""  Really? Or is it because people aren't aware of the amazing groups out there that make it their daily goal to ""reduce, reuse and recycle""?  </p>
<p>For me, it began a few years ago when I was removing some baseboard in my basement. In my case, the baseboard was wonderful solid wood that had been perfectly cut and installed long ago.  It had to come off, but when I looked at the custom angled cuts in the corners… I knew I didn't have the skill or equipment to replicate the baseboard, nor did I see a single reason to throw it out, so I numbered the pieces and stored them on my porch for reinstallation after the new floor!  Newsflash: baseboard is generally installed with a ""brad nailer"" which shoots these 15 to 18-gauge staples through the baseboard into the framing.  In my specific case, whoever installed these was ""overzealous"" to say the least, and each baseboard piece I took off was riddled with brads and looked (on the wall facing side) a bit like a porcupine.  I was confident.  I had tools.  Lots of tools.  I had been handed down my Dad's tools.  I collected tools at garage sales for many years.  No problem!  Let me just get out to the garage and… huh?  I looked and looked and brought each possible solution to the porch, where I'd placed the baseboard on sawhorses and flipped them over for a quick brad removal.  I tried every manner of plier.  Tedious, slow, ineffective.  Wow.  This wood is looking unuseable!  No!  I don't have the skill, the time or even the extra dollars!  Then it came to me.  <strong>I'll make my own tool</strong>.  I will design something expressly for the purpose at hand!  Brads need to be gripped with gusto and pulled through the BACK of the board.  Once I gripped these long skinny nails at the base of the board, I’d need to lift and grip at the same time.  Turns out that there had to be a lever and fulcrum.  The jaws had to come together tightly out at the tips and have real gripping power while I rocked back on the “spoon-shaped fulcrum”.  Thank you Archimedes!</p>
<p>Enter the Nail Hunter!  Precise tips for gripping fasteners as thin as staples.  A spoon fulcrum head that rocks and levers out embedded nails.  A rear pulling area for extremely quick pulling of partially buried nails! And additionally, a flat spot behind the rivet to tap with a hammer if you need to dig a little deeper. Let's do this!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What our goal is...</h3>
<p>First and foremost our goal is to put effective tools into the hands of people with a passion for reuse. Our campaign will directly contribute tools to the BMRA.org, a 501(c)3 charity, that is working to help create a world without waste. This charity and your support means that both of you will get a Nail Hunter that is powerfully effective, simple to use, and designed for efficiency. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>The Nail Hunter is a tool for change because it materially reduces the time and effort it takes to ""get your wood back.""  Reusing wood also saves you lots of money and is good karma. Using a tool like the Nail Hunter allows volunteers, deconstruction groups and recyclers to clean used wood for another new purpose!  Responsible deconstruction, demolition, recycling!  A  2 by 4 with a few nails protruding out of it has no business (or purpose!) in the scrap pile. Wood is so amazingly resilient that if you can effectively remove nails with very little residual damage, the lumber can be redeployed back into an entirely different construction project!   Filling landfills with lumber that has served only a single purpose in its life so far is not just absurd, it's a bit arrogant, isn't it?  We know that to change this behavior, a change of mindset is needed.  Respectfully, there are also real TOOLS needed.  Along with education and the mobilization of groups like the BMRA (The Building Materials Reuse Association), BigReuse.org and others… there have to be tools that allow the savings of TIME and MONEY, and that's what the Nail Hunter offers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Risks &amp; Challenge</h3>
<p>It's not easy to design and build a brand new hand tool. We're going to need a forging die created in order to make these unusual pliers. Currently, there is a tendency to use what's already ""in our kitchen drawer"" or toolbox, and that may continue. There are basically two hurdles keeping most new products from becoming widely adopted: you have to let the world know it exists to solve a common problem, and you have to teach the folks how to use it!  Hopefully, the amazing platform we have here will ""close the gap"" quickly and the features of my ""nail pulling pliers"" will become compelling enough for every one of you to make this your favorite new tool.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It is my hope that even if you don't buy a Nail Hunter, you will think about gifting one to one of the amazing organizations that promote the reuse of wood and the responsible deconstruction and recycling of lumber and other construction materials to <strong>save trees and reduce unnecessary waste in our landfills</strong>.  Also, you can use your own powerful social media platforms to get our message out...there's a simple solution to an arduous task...the Nail Hunter!</p>

<h2><strong>Orchid Blade</strong></h2>
<p>Shaving isn't easy.  It's even harder when you can't see what you're doing with a large blade attached to the end of an awkwardly angled handle.  You shouldn't be required to be an expert at yoga just to shave. </p>
<p>The Orchid Blade allows you to have the blade right at your finger tip.  With its flexible handle you are provided with maximum maneuverability.  Add in a premium triple blade razor cartridge and you get a great close shave.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2><strong>Birth of an Idea</strong></h2>
<p>Shaving is something I actually enjoy doing.  There is nothing better than the close shave of a straight razor.  Unfortunately it doesn't work everywhere.  I'm more or less bald so I shave my head to finish off what nature has left.  For that I use my <a href=""http://www.headblade.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HeadBlade®</a>, a razor specifically designed to shave the head.</p>
<p>While in the shower shaving (without a mirror), I noticed the wall of products my wife owns.  I happen to think about how difficult it must be for women to shave.  As I started to shave around my mustache, my finger tip naturally went to the edge of the blade guiding the razor.  That small motion sparked an idea.  I talked to my wife, had a few awkward conversations with her friends, and the Orchid Blade was born.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Advantage</strong></h2>
<p>Most ""Bikini Blades"" are bulky and awkward.  Here is one of the many sites that rank <a href=""http://www.squidoo.com/top-10-best-bikini-razors-and-bikini-trimmers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""bikini razors"".</a>  Orchid Blade is more than just a bikini razor!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Problem #1 - They are just too wide</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/Fqao2kwl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Orchid Blade is half the width of a standard triple blade razor.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Problem #2 - The small ones just look dangerous!</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/CU0cg2q.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Orchid Blade has a premium triple blade disposable cartridge. Typical bikini razors have a single blade permanently attached to the handle.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Problem #3 - The Handle </strong></h3>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/LbPXwhll.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Orchid Blade has a flexible handle that bends with your finger. Simply insert your finger into the two rings with the tip resting on top of the blade. Your finger will naturally guide the blade along all the curves for the perfect shave.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Project Status</strong></h2>
<p>☑ Concept - Originally sketched out on the back of an old medical bill.  From there it went through many iterations to make sure I had the best idea possible.</p>
<p>☑ Research - Talked to a good number of women, scoured the internet, and searched patents.  I also bought a bunch of razors that are on the market today, tore them apart, and learned how they worked.</p>
<p>☑ Design - Took the research and created some 3d Models.  Again, it took multiple iterations to create what I feel to be a great product.</p>
<p>☑ Prototypes - Multiple prototypes were made.  It was very difficult to get one that had some flexibility, but I managed to make something that worked.</p>
<p>☑ Suppliers - This was a bit harder.  The handle was easy, the smaller razor cartridge took some time.  However, I have quotes for tooling and the first small run of parts.</p>
<p>☐ <strong>Money!</strong> - This is where Indiegogo comes in.  With any luck we'll be off to the next step.</p>
<p>☐ Order Tooling - To get the molds made should take around 10 weeks.</p>
<p>After the tooling is made, I will receive a sample run to verify the molds were made correctly.  At that time I'll make any necessary adjustments and get your rewards in the mail!</p>
<p><strong>The Final Step</strong> - Get Orchid Blade into stores nationwide!</p>
<h2><strong><br/> The Money</strong></h2>
<p>The largest amount goes toward tooling; plastic parts require steel molds for injection molding machines. Funding also goes to packaging (designing/obtaining), and to fees required by the US Patent Office (patent protection).</p>
<p>Just know that I have created a dynamic spreadsheet with all the numbers to ensure the $35,000 will get the product into your hands.</p>
<p><em>**Orchid Blade is Patent Pending**</em></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risk</h2>
<p>The majority of the work for this project is complete, now I simply need funding to order tooling and prototypes. While problems do arise from time to time in any project, I'm confident that my industry connections and creative problem solving skills will keep things on track; I've worked in research and development for 8 years and have extensive experience.</p>
<p>I do expect shipping to be quite a task. Getting that much product out of one's home will be challenging, but it should be manageable.</p>
<p>If any issues do arise I'll make sure to keep my backers informed.</p>

<div style=""text-align: left;"">We are delighted to introduce Fotogen: a smart and beautiful lamp for your home.</div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">Think different of the known shapes - it's an endless source of inspiration!  The Fotogen idea is originated from the vintage petroleum lantern, its design being re-thought and reinvented into a simple, minimalistic and sleek lamp. But it is not only about looking good outside, it is also about being smart inside. Fotogen is powerful, smart, adjustable and portable - an evolution of which an old petroleum lamp would be proud. </div>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<b>We want to change the position of the smart lamps. It will not be a useless toy more or be just a nightlight for bedroom. Fotogen is functional bright lantern for everyday use with some really useful features.</b><br/>

</div><div><p></p></div></div>","Hello, Indiegogo!
We are delighted to introduce Fotogen: a smart and beautiful lamp for your home.
Think different of the known shapes - it's an endless source of inspiration!  The Fotogen idea is originated from the vintage petroleum lantern, its design being re-thought and reinvented into a simple, minimalistic and sleek lamp. But it is not only about looking good outside, it is also about being smart inside. Fotogen is powerful, smart, adjustable and portable - an evolution of which an old petroleum lamp would be proud. 

We want to change the position of the smart lamps. It will not be a useless toy more or be just a nightlight for bedroom. Fotogen is functional bright lantern for everyday use with some really useful features.








You'll
appreciate the unusual yet simple design of the lamp and its aluminum
body. Powerful battery enables Fotogen to work without being plugged
to the grid for 5
hours. The lamp is a powerful 600 lm 16M colors with an extra set of
warm white LEDs. Fotogen is bluetooth controled for your convenience.



One app to rule it all 




Turn on by touch


Adjust hue and intensity

Forget about wires! Take Fotogen with you




Get instantly notified about your messanges



Alarm clock in your lantern



Tech specs









 


Fotogen for work. A bright light source on your desk with possibility to adjust light temperature. You can also switch message indication if needed, not to miss something important when your phone is in silent mode.


Fotogen
for home.
Fotogen
will color your place with every hue existing in nature.
Fotogen
has two LED types controlled from app. This allows to customize the
lighting during the day. Whether you are throwing a party or planning
a date Fotogen will be there for you. 

The
lamp has a timer you can set, and it will wake you up in the morning
or will turn on when you come home in the evening.  



Fotogen
out of home.
With
itspowerful
battery Fotogen can be autonomous for as much as 5 hours. Take it to
your picnic in the park and have a convenient light source with you. 










A
team of developers got together in late 2014 to create a new design
product which would not only be smart but also look good. The team
consists of a designer (Lena), an engineer (Alex) and product manager
(Dima). Lena has the experience as a designer in several IT and real
estate companies. Alex was involved in capital projects management in
a big international production company. Dima has founded and is now
running own small hospitality company.

<p><i>Note from the inventor:</i></p>
<p>On a personal note, my dad had a quite devastating stroke and my Grandma needs a caretaker for simple household tasks. I received several heart-felt health and disability-related comments, and this hit a soft spot with me. Living with a disability is difficult for the patient as well as the family, and I believe that this simple device can help. I did this project to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve ""holdability"" of every container worldwide</li>
<li>Scratch my own itch  a universal handle</li>
<li>Reduce hand-related pain</li>
<li>Help people like Tye improve quality of life</li>

<p>We were inspired by the simplicity, and functionality of industrial work lights. With SPOT, we retained the mobility of conventional torches and industrial work lights, as well as the dynamic rotational movement of theatrical stage lights. Stripping them down to their essentials and introduced an element of playfulness to it, bringing you a refreshing design of a functional light.</p>

<h2>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>This is our first crowdfunding campaign and thus we might experience delays in terms of manufacturing completion as well as shipping due to unforeseen circumstances.</p>
<p>We want to deliver only the best to you. As such we ask for your patience and understanding as there may be unforseen delays while we source for only the finest quality of materials and manufacturers.<br/><br/>However rest assured that the team is under close guidance of experienced industry professionals and we will definitely be keeping you updated with our progress via this campaign page, our facebook page (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Spot/361327487313235"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Spot/361327487313235</a>) or emails if required.<br/><br/></p>
<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>How does the light work?</h3>
<p>SPOT's on/off button is integrated into one of the two hinges joining the body and the handle. The button is YELLOW to distinct itself from the other hinge. </p>
<h3>
<br/>What does the light operate on?</h3>
<p>Currently, SPOT runs on 6 1.5V AAA batteries. We understand that this may seem like a hassle but we assure you that upon sufficient funding, we will definitely be sourcing for rechargeable batteries or alternative battery types for greater user convenience.</p>
<h3>
<br/>How do I replace the batteries?</h3>
<p>The batteries are hidden in SPOT's body itself. To replace, simply lift the lid off the case and insert new batteries.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Will the diffuser lid fall off the casing easily?</h3>
<p>No, rest assured that the lid fits onto the casing snugly and is not loose.</p>
<h3>
<br/>How long will the batteries last for?</h3>
<p>With continuous usage, the batteries will power SPOT for up to about 8 hours.</p>
<h3>
<br/>What is the lifespan of the LED?</h3>
<p>LEDs are created to last for a reasonably long time. We only use high quality LEDs in SPOT which are expected to last at least 50,000 hours. If you left it on all day everyday it would last about 5 and a half years.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Why do you have only 2 colours?</h3>
<p>We currently only have 2 colours but depending on the reception of our campaign we will surely consider setting a stretch goal so that we can bring more colours to SPOT.<br/><br/></p>

SPOT - the light with a sweet spot
SPOT is a multi-purpose light that can be hung, hand-held, or simply placed on a surface. It can function as a torch, desk lamp, ambience light, or wall light - use it however and whenever you like!SPOT is adaptable to a variety of situations. The elegant aesthetics of the light allows you to place it anywhere in the comfort of your home without fear of it being obtrusive.
SPOT is made of durable polypropylene (PP) material and is splash resistant. This means that you can even use it in the outdoors without fear of moisture damage.



DESIGN CONCEPTION
We were inspired by the simplicity, and functionality of industrial work lights. With SPOT, we retained the mobility of conventional torches and industrial work lights, as well as the dynamic rotational movement of theatrical stage lights. Stripping them down to their essentials and introduced an element of playfulness to it, bringing you a refreshing design of a functional light.

Currently, we offer SPOT in two colours - cool grey and tangerine.

<p><b>INTRODUCTION.</b></p>
<p>We are a small group of electronics enthusiasts with a lot of experience in automatic control devices and sensors.<br/></p>
<span class=""notranlsate"">In the old days when developing electronics was always possible to find though hole alternatives for nearly all components, now the components are getting smaller and more difficult to solder by hand. All new electronic components are designed to be soldered with solder paste in automatic ovens. The problem is that professional ovens are quite expensive and not thought to be used at home.<br/><br/>So we decided to develop an alternative that could be used at home for small developers or hobbyists.

We are a small group of electronics enthusiasts with a lot of experience in automatic control devices and sensors.
In the old days when developing electronics was always possible to find though hole alternatives for nearly all components, now the components are getting smaller and more difficult to solder by hand. All new electronic components are designed to be soldered with solder paste in automatic ovens. The problem is that professional ovens are quite expensive and not thought to be used at home.So we decided to develop an alternative that could be used at home for small developers or hobbyists. The idea is to transform a simple toaster oven (easy to find for 35$) into a reflow oven.See our video for a simple explanation here.HOW IT WORKS.Domestic toaster ovens are quite simple machines, a resistance or an infrared lamp is connected to the mains and heats up the interior of the oven, a simple mechanical thermostat will cut supply when the target temperature is reached. The problem is that mechanical thermostats can not regulate temperature and heating ramps so the control is not good enough for good solder joints.The ideal temperature curve for soldering electronic components would be something like this.
Our controller monitors the temperature of the oven with a external temperature sensor and regulate the temperature by switching supply several times per second in order to achieve a really accurate temperature regulation. To switch the supply it is necessary to install a Solid State Relay which will be controlled by our controller.The schematic of the connection can be seen below:The regulation works using PWM regulation so it changes the length of pulses to the supply depending on the actual state of the temperature. For calculating the correct PWM output the controller uses a  PID  (Proportional, Integral, Derivative) loop.The whole setup and control of the device is made with a computer connected to the controller by a standard USB cable. This connection will allow us to supervise the soldering status and to change soldering parameters, it will also generate a file with all the temperature measurements made during each soldering. 
If you want to get more information you can visit our webpage and download manuals or the windows controller software Project webpage.WHY ARE WE SETTING UP THIS PROJECT?.Well, the obvious reason was to be able to design pcbs with surface mount components and being able to solder them easily afterwards. Once our first controller was done and we were happy with the result we asked our selves, why don't we simplify the design to make something economic and easy to use for everyone?, and this is how we develop this controller.Now to manufacture it at a reasonable price we need to buy some of the components and the pcbs in big quantities to reduce the price. We have set the limits of the quantities in the perks to allow it. WHAT IS INCLUDED AND WHAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE PERKS.If you take a look to the perks you will see that there are two main differences between them. There are perks that include the controller card, the sensor (standard k type thermocouple) and the plastic box and others that only have the controller card. This is because many electronics enthusiasts have already this K-type thermocouples at home so it is not necessary to supply them with more. The box is optional as it is not needed normally as many of you will probably install the controller card inside the oven. The box is supplied without holes so if you order it you will have to make the holes yourselves, sorry but we don't have a laser cutter and it will take too much time to drill the holes for all of you.One component we don't supply is the solid state relay, this is because it is really easy to find and because we don't know the power of your oven and the mains voltage in your country. It would be difficult to get a good price for you in this component if we supply a different SSR in every shipment.
Anyway, you can find SSRs easily in Farnell, Conrad, RScomponents, Mouser, Digikey or even in ebay. You will have to look for a relay with a control voltage of  5Vdc and able to handle your oven power.Same thing for thermocouples if you what to procure them yourself it is easy in your electronics shop, Farnell, Conrad, Digikey, RScomponents, Mouser or ebay.

<p>Hi my name is Amanda Tyrrell, I am a stay at home Mum, whilst studying.I was in the kitchen one day and my margarine was full of crumbs and vegemite, it looked awful, and I hated it so much. I figured I couldnt be the only one, and after some research, I found I wasnt. It is a pet hate for many people out there, so I went to see a designer (Jason@Invention Steps) who help me out with a solution, and this is what we come up with. I have a prototype, but now I need to get it out there, I need to buy the equipment, make a few adjustments, have some extra designs done, and create the website We have put so much into this and really want it to succeed.</p>

<p>   If you have tried using desk organizers , you have probably felt our frustration . Many aren’t designed to satisfy your needs , and are generally made as a cheap desk accessory .</p>
<h3>   That's why we made the Smart Organizer !</h3>
<p>   We wanted to set a new bar for quality and make something that looks really good on your desk.</p>
<p>   So we’ve spent the last months obsessing over this project to get the perfect balance between design and functionality .</p>
<p>   Through endless tinkering with different types of materials and dimensions we’ve been able to distill what we believe a modern desk organizer should be.</p>
<p><strong>   The Smart Organizer is beautifully designed  from hard wood and it comes with gorgeous wallet/book support ,  pen organizer and a piece of leather or fabric (to keep your stuff) .</strong></p>

<p> </p></div>","If you have tried using desk organizers , you have probably felt our frustration . Many aren’t designed to satisfy your needs , and are generally made as a cheap desk accessory .
   That's why we made the Smart Organizer !
   We wanted to set a new bar for quality and make something that looks really good on your desk.
   So we’ve spent the last months obsessing over this project to get the perfect balance between design and functionality .
   Through endless tinkering with different types of materials and dimensions we’ve been able to distill what we believe a modern desk organizer should be.
   The Smart Organizer is beautifully designed  from hard wood and it comes with gorgeous wallet/book support ,  pen organizer and a piece of leather or fabric (to keep your stuff) .
 
 
 
 
 
   Features  :
 

is neither too large,  nor too small
is neither too broad  nor too narrow
is made from high quality hard wood
let’s you keep all your pens tougether
adapts to the user, not the user having to adapt to it
is minimally designed
will never wear out
the piece of fabric/leather is designed for you to be able to put your sunglasses,phone or whatever you want , without scratching it
isn't  just another useless desk organizer
isn't limited to only one design

   Smart Organizer does all these things and still has a design that is minimal and look’s  amazing!

<p><strong>Our Story….</strong></p>
<p>Robert Potorti owned a small restoration company in southern Indiana. His mother lived in Pennsylvania (near Philadelphia), and she wanted a small heater for her living room. Robert wanted to send her a new combination portable air conditioner-heat pump.  Just so there would be no confusion, he ordered two units (exactly the same make and model); there would be one for his office and one for his mother’s living room. If she had questions, he would be able to answer them remotely from Indiana.</p>
<p>When he used the machine, he was surprised to find out that a substantial amount of condensate water was generated, even in the heat pump mode; worse yet, the water came out at the bottom of the machine (about an inch and a third higher than the floor). He didn’t want his 90 year old mother bending down on the floor with a pie pan, and trying to carry water that would dump rather easily to the kitchen sink. So he went on line to buy something that would solve the problem, but as much as he looked, there was nothing available anywhere.</p>
<p>How could it be that no one made such a device? Why would they have a remote control for the unit, but yet no automatic way of emptying the condensate water? It needed rethinking.</p>
<p>Water would accumulate in the summer and the winter. Even though there is an evaporative system when in the air conditioner mode, water can still accumulate when you least expect it, making the machine somewhat undependable.</p>
<p>It was suggested (by Andrew Selter, Robert’s Lead Manager for the first business) to bring the advances that were created to the marketplace. Robert designed a pumping system that went through numerous changes and testing until production was ready to start. At the same time testing was being done on a kit that would insulate the air exit hose and window opening; it had to insulate well and have an appearance that would be acceptable in someone’s living room. It also had to be as user friendly as possible. Most of all, it could not be prohibitively costly. These were difficult tasks as no company to date had been able to accomplish these objectives.</p>
<p>Surveys showed that people were too often upset at the condensate issue as well as their machine’s lack of ability to adequately cool their living space. Increasing efficiency is one path to better performance as well as savings in electric (mostly during peak demand times).   </p>
<p>To date a patent is pending that will allow a pump system to keep water from freezing in the line during winter months as well as insulating the hose and window in a way that looks acceptable and is as user friendly as possible, yet can work with the vast majority of brands and window sizes (this along with other technical advances are included in the patent application).</p>

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Whirly-Go-Round is a solution for parents of kids who want options for physical play that are more fun than staring at a screen and so well-made, can still be fun for another generation. Made of solid, hand-crafted bamboo, kids love the feeling of control they get from mastering the physical gyrations that propel them around for as long and fast as they want.</p>
<h3><strong>Mission: Funomenal &amp; Sustainable Fun!</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Funomenal Fun</strong> exceeds expectations, creating a sense of wow and awe.</li>
<li>
<strong>Sustainable Fun</strong> lasts for years, the thrill never fades.</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe, when able to play to their hearts' content, children can better discover their God-given gifts.</p>
<h3><strong>Born of family passion</strong></h3>
<p>I'm Chuck Knerr, founder of Spud 'N Rich. I come from a family of toymakers. I named the company in honor of my dad, Rich Knerr, and Spud Melin, they're my heroes! Together they created some of America's most iconic toys. Their little company was a gnat compared to the elephants of Mattel and Hasbro. But a lot of today's grandparents' most cherished memories of childhood involve Hula Hoop, Frisbee or Super Ball. Today's parents likely remember Slip 'N Slide, Trac-Ball or Silly String. My childhood was spent testing toys. The ones that worked and the countless ones that didn't.</p>

<p><strong><i>Chuck Knerr, Selling Slip 'N Slides, Water Wiggle Commercial, and Testing Super Stuff</i></strong></p>
<p>My childhood was fun! Not just because of the toys but my Dad's dedication to making everything fun, especially work. My passion for doing this is from dad's inspiration, and the joy it gives me to see kids having big fun, spinning on a Whirly-Go-Round. My hope is for kids to have the kind of fun I was blessed with growing up. I want every child to have their own ""good old days"" to fondly remember.</p>

<h3><strong>A thrill I never forgot</strong></h3>
<p>The thrill I had spinning on a contraption my Dad brought home when I was 6, is still with me decades later.  It was like a one-person Merry-Go-Round. While just sitting and holding on, if I leaned back, it rotated! And I quickly learned that if I leaned forward at just the right time, it would not only continue to rotate, but pick up speed. I could spin as long and as fast as I wanted.   Funomenal!</p>

<p><strong><i>The original ""contrapation""  I tested when I was 6.</i></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Dad's challenge to me</strong></h3>
<p>It was the most fun product they never made.  When Dad was in his seventies, I asked him why? He said there were just too many problems they couldn't solve. I protested, they should have kept trying and shared my memories of how much fun it was. He challenged me to solve those problems and I bet him I could. That was just like both Spud and Dad- can do!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591069652/tw4sdmlw5uumhnvsr4q8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It goes back to how they started in my grandmother's garage, making hardwood slingshots and selling them by mail order. They pulled themselves up by their own slingshot straps!</p>
<p>Well, Dad took that bet and I'm just sorry it's taken me this long because he and Spud aren't around to enjoy it.</p>
<h3><strong>Eurkea! Bamboo!</strong></h3>
<p>I got serious last year, designing prototypes. I started with wood, then shifted to metal. During Spud and Rich's era, plastic was the future. Today, it's just clutter and ends up in the next garage sale or a landfill. But what was in my heart was to create a toy that would last, an <i>heirloom toy</i>. That's when I discovered <i>bamboo</i>. Bamboo changed everything. It has the strength and durability of steel in gorgeous solid pieces that can be invisibly joined into a beautiful piece of modern-art. Bamboo allowed me to create a product that performs better, looks beautiful in any room and can last long enough to hand down to your children's children.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591069615/v8cnupe61ywqeybyg6ng.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Testing, testing</strong></h3>
<p>Every idea Spud and Rich created, my sisters and I and the Melin girls ""tested"" long before they came to market as a product. So I took the first Whirly-Go-Round next-door to the neighbor girls. It worked! Then I took several prototypes to the Wednesday night children's group at church. One by one, those kids hopped on and started to spin. They lined up and took turns, they invented competitions. Before I knew it, their parents were at the door , it was already time to go.  Time really does fly when you're having fun!  </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h2><strong>Now, it's up to you</strong></h2>
<p>There's one last hurdle to overcome. Will parents and grandparents buy Whirly-Go-Round? When Dad and Spud started in the garage, their answer came when the first mail orders showed up in their post office box. Our answer will come from you; parents and grandparents backing our project on IndieGoGo. </p>
<h3><strong>Please: </strong></h3>
<p>Back this project and banish boredom from your home.</p>
<p>Back this project and give your kids Funomenal Fun to create lasting memories and make these, their very own good-old-days.</p>
<p>Back this project and give yourselves a break from the clutter of plastic toys with one simple, durable toy they'll enjoy for years.</p>
<p>Back this project and give yourselves the gift of beautiful bamboo to grace your home with an intriguing piece of modern art, that is, if the kids ever leave it alone.</p>
<h3><strong>Please Pass the Word</strong></h3>
<p>Even if you don't have kids or grandkids of Whiry-Go-Round age, it's likely that the kid in you looks at this and wonders if they make one for adults? Sadly, no. But please help spread the fun!</p>

<h3><strong>Not Your Grandma's Sit 'N Spin!</strong></h3>
<p>A lot of parents and grandparents fondly recall Playskool's Sit 'N Spin. What makes Whirly-Go-Round, go around is entirely different, it's faster, more fun and a lot more satisfying for kids to master. </p>

<h3><strong>Heirloom Toy</strong></h3>
<p>From the outset, I wanted to make a toy that could last long enough to be handed down to your children's children. Too many toys are cheaply made, the fun wears off and they clutter the house before ending up in a landfill. I designed and constructed Whirly-Go-Round like I was making it for my own family to pass down for generations. I settled on bamboo as the primary material. It's the hardest known wood and the most durable. And what a blessing that's it's so beautiful too!</p>
</div>
<p>To be strong, durable and sustainable Whirly-Go-Round has to be made of solid wood. But instead of killing old-growth trees, we use bamboo, which is actually a type of grass that regrows incredibly fast and can be fashioned into the hardest known wood. It's 2 to 3 times harder than oak! Bamboo is the most sustainable wood source. Bamboo is an ideal material for an heirloom toy.  Your Whirly-Go-Round can last and provide fun for a very long time.</p>

<h3><strong>Physics Fun01</strong></h3>
<p>What makes it go?! It's physics. And it's a great way to introduce them to physical sciences. There's mass, center of gravity, acceleration, gravitational potential energy, and all sorts of aspects they don't care about yet. They just know they want to go! The sense of movement and their bodily adjustments to those movements produce decreases or increases in their acceleration. On the fly, their responses and rapid decision-making constantly improve as they get the ""feel"" of it. Spinning is not only fun, but gives them a real sense of achievement and control over themselves and their environment. But they only know it's Fun!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Whirly-Go-Round represents a paradigm shift in children's play. You will be demonstrating to your child less really is more. Children need more fun, but it doesn't mean they need more and more toys. Fewer toys that provide more fun and last longer deliver more value.</p>
<h3><strong>Whirly-Go-Round is a Change for the Better </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>From the clutter of plastic toys that kids soon tire of and end up in landfills.</li>
<li>From the need to pick up the toys before company arrives.</li>
<li>From passive, electronic entertainment.</li>
<li>Toward physically active and mentally stimulating fun.</li>
</ul>
<div> </div>
<h3><strong>Who took the ""play"" out of playtime?</strong></h3>
<p>After sitting most of the day in school, Couch time/screen time is a growing epidemic. Children spend as much as 40 hours a week glued to digital devices that offer to bring excitement &amp; entertainment to their lives, but often leave them inactive and disengaged with life around them. Content providers have developed savvy algorithms for attracting young eyeballs and feeding children content they like to see; along with advertising.</p>
<h3><strong>Active, Physical Fun</strong></h3>
<p>Whirly-Go-Round requires a child to actively engage body and mind to operate. It's fascinating to watch them as work out how to make it go. You can almost see the signals being sent between the inner-ears, brains and bodies,  feeling the movement and adjusting their center of mass to make it go. The thrill sparks their imaginations. Are they flying? Racing? Going to the moon?</p>
<h3><strong>Spinning</strong></h3>
<p>There is plenty of science behind the positive developmental benefits of spinning for children. And they will get DIZZY. Most children like that feeling (but not adults). That has to do with the fact their their brains are developing and spinning engages both sides of the brain with their bodies and inner-ears helping to enhance their vestibular system, which increases physical coordination, balance, ability to focus, to listen and all sorts of things that can help them develop.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>You will receive a first-edition Whirly-Go-Round</p>
<p>• Solid. hand-crafted bamboo Whirly-Go-Round with Metal First Edition Plate</p>
<p>• Built to last.<br/>• Rubber feet to protect floors and prevent slipping on carpet.<br/>• Recommended for children ages 4-12 years<br/>• Not recommended for adults.</p>
<p>Good thing shipping is included because these beauties weigh 35 POUNDS EACH! (Truly built to last!) Our Whirly-Go-Round will arrive assembled so there is nothing to do but unbox it and play! </p>
<p>There is a minimum order quantity for the bamboo we need to deliver Whirly-Go-Round. We have calculated our pricing to enable us to deliver the minimum quantity. </p>
<p>Each Whirly-Go-Round is made of solid bamboo pieces. Bamboo is the hardest wood on earth and as such, is very dense. That makes it strong and durable but also heavy. We use steel hardware to assemble it with a heavy-duty steel swivel bearing designed for adults.</p>
<p>We're planning on delivering your Whirly-Go-Round in October and November, well in time for Christmas. </p>
<p>We've limited the number of rewards for good reasons. As mentioned, we want to do everything possible to meet delivery in time for Christmas. At the same time, Whirly-Go-Round is hand-crafted and assembled here in Texas. We want to devote the time and careful attention to deliver with the best possible quality. You've heard the terms, ""military-grade,"" ""medical-grade,"" and the like? To us, ""child-grade"" deserves the highest level of care and diligence.</p>

<p>Over the past year we have designed and redesigned about 17 different versions. This try, try again philosophy means we've taken most of the risk on ourselves before bringing it to you for backing. The result; we have successfully produced nine prototypes. This followed a rigorous testing process with children that allowed us to identify further design and performance improvements that we fine-tuned and included in your Whirly-Go-Round.</p>
<p>We have worked diligently to ready this product for IndieGoGo and fulfillment, but here are what we see as the risks and our plan to handle them:<br/><br/>BAMBOO:  We have lined up at least three suppliers who have been able to produce high quality bamboo to our specifications and whose samples we have used and approved. These suppliers have confirmed they are ready to produce and any one of them can supply the amounts we need. We can forsee some risk the Covid virus might return as an issue in China. In the event it does, it would not prevent delivery of orders but could delay them.</p>
<p>Every other component is available in the U.S. Our fabrication, assembly and shipping will all be accomplished in house. That means all those steps are under our control so there is little to no risk of delay on these.<br/><br/>FULFILLMENT: In general, stuff happens that can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, customs clearance or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. We are using the United States Postal Service to bring Whirly-Go-Round to your door.. We’ll keep open and honest communication with you through our process so you know where your product is and when it’s going to get to you.</p>
<p>We have worked hard to prevent any delays in delivering Whirly-Go-Round. We feel our delivery goal is attainable because:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have sourced multiple suppliers and successfully tested their samples for quality and suitability. We have tested samples from four capable suppliers.</li>
<li>There is no shortage of bamboo or hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Please Pass the Word</strong></h3>
<p>Even if you don't have kids or grandkids of Whiry-Go-Round age, it's likely that the kid in you looks at this and wonders if they make one for adults? Sorry, no. But please help spread the fun!</p>

Today, it's just clutter and ends up in the next garage sale or a landfill. But what was in my heart was to create a toy that would last, an heirloom toy. That's when I discovered bamboo. Bamboo changed everything. It has the strength and durability of steel in gorgeous solid pieces that can be invisibly joined into a beautiful piece of modern-art. Bamboo allowed me to create a product that performs better, looks beautiful in any room and can last long enough to hand down to your children's children.

Testing, testing
Every idea Spud and Rich created, my sisters and I and the Melin girls ""tested"" long before they came to market as a product. So I took the first Whirly-Go-Round next-door to the neighbor girls. It worked! Then I took several prototypes to the Wednesday night children's group at church. One by one, those kids hopped on and started to spin. They lined up and took turns, they invented competitions. Before I knew it, their parents were at the door , it was already time to go.  Time really does fly when you're having fun!  

 
Now, it's up to you
There's one last hurdle to overcome. Will parents and grandparents buy Whirly-Go-Round? When Dad and Spud started in the garage, their answer came when the first mail orders showed up in their post office box. Our answer will come from you; parents and grandparents backing our project on IndieGoGo. 
Please: 
Back this project and banish boredom from your home.
Back this project and give your kids Funomenal Fun to create lasting memories and make these, their very own good-old-days.
Back this project and give yourselves a break from the clutter of plastic toys with one simple, durable toy they'll enjoy for years.
Back this project and give yourselves the gift of beautiful bamboo to grace your home with an intriguing piece of modern art, that is, if the kids ever leave it alone.
Please Pass the Word
Even if you don't have kids or grandkids of Whiry-Go-Round age, it's likely that the kid in you looks at this and wonders if they make one for adults? Sadly, no. But please help spread the fun!

Not Your Grandma's Sit 'N Spin!
A lot of parents and grandparents fondly recall Playskool's Sit 'N Spin. What makes Whirly-Go-Round, go around is entirely different, it's faster, more fun and a lot more satisfying for kids to master. 


Heirloom Toy
From the outset, I wanted to make a toy that could last long enough to be handed down to your children's children. Too many toys are cheaply made, the fun wears off and they clutter the house before ending up in a landfill. I designed and constructed Whirly-Go-Round like I was making it for my own family to pass down for generations. I settled on bamboo as the primary material. It's the hardest known wood and the most durable. And what a blessing that's it's so beautiful too!

To be strong, durable and sustainable Whirly-Go-Round has to be made of solid wood. But instead of killing old-growth trees, we use bamboo, which is actually a type of grass that regrows incredibly fast and can be fashioned into the hardest known wood. It's 2 to 3 times harder than oak! Bamboo is the most sustainable wood source. Bamboo is an ideal material for an heirloom toy.  Your Whirly-Go-Round can last and provide fun for a very long time.

These are the First Edition of Whirly-Go-Round, signified by a numbered metal plate. This campaign is the only time these first editions will be offered.

Beautiful in Any Room!

Physics Fun01
What makes it go?! It's physics. And it's a great way to introduce them to physical sciences. There's mass, center of gravity, acceleration, gravitational potential energy, and all sorts of aspects they don't care about yet. They just know they want to go! The sense of movement and their bodily adjustments to those movements produce decreases or increases in their acceleration. On the fly, their responses and rapid decision-making constantly improve as they get the ""feel"" of it. Spinning is not only fun, but gives them a real sense of achievement and control over themselves and their environment. But they only know it's Fun!
 
The Impact
Whirly-Go-Round represents a paradigm shift in children's play. You will be demonstrating to your child less really is more. Children need more fun, but it doesn't mean they need more and more toys. Fewer toys that provide more fun and last longer deliver more value.
Whirly-Go-Round is a Change for the Better 

From the clutter of plastic toys that kids soon tire of and end up in landfills.
From the need to pick up the toys before company arrives.
From passive, electronic entertainment.
Toward physically active and mentally stimulating fun.

 
Who took the ""play"" out of playtime?
After sitting most of the day in school, Couch time/screen time is a growing epidemic. Children spend as much as 40 hours a week glued to digital devices that offer to bring excitement & entertainment to their lives, but often leave them inactive and disengaged with life around them. Content providers have developed savvy algorithms for attracting young eyeballs and feeding children content they like to see; along with advertising.
Active, Physical Fun
Whirly-Go-Round requires a child to actively engage body and mind to operate. It's fascinating to watch them as work out how to make it go. You can almost see the signals being sent between the inner-ears, brains and bodies,  feeling the movement and adjusting their center of mass to make it go. The thrill sparks their imaginations. Are they flying? Racing? Going to the moon?
Spinning
There is plenty of science behind the positive developmental benefits of spinning for children. And they will get DIZZY. Most children like that feeling (but not adults). That has to do with the fact their their brains are developing and spinning engages both sides of the brain with their bodies and inner-ears helping to enhance their vestibular system, which increases physical coordination, balance, ability to focus, to listen and all sorts of things that can help them develop.

What We Need & What You Get
You will receive a first-edition Whirly-Go-Round
• Solid. hand-crafted bamboo Whirly-Go-Round with Metal First Edition Plate
• Built to last.• Rubber feet to protect floors and prevent slipping on carpet.• Recommended for children ages 4-12 years• Not recommended for adults.
Good thing shipping is included because these beauties weigh 35 POUNDS EACH! (Truly built to last!) Our Whirly-Go-Round will arrive assembled so there is nothing to do but unbox it and play! 
There is a minimum order quantity for the bamboo we need to deliver Whirly-Go-Round. We have calculated our pricing to enable us to deliver the minimum quantity. 
Each Whirly-Go-Round is made of solid bamboo pieces. Bamboo is the hardest wood on earth and as such, is very dense. That makes it strong and durable but also heavy. We use steel hardware to assemble it with a heavy-duty steel swivel bearing designed for adults.
We're planning on delivering your Whirly-Go-Round in October and November, well in time for Christmas. 
We've limited the number of rewards for good reasons. As mentioned, we want to do everything possible to meet delivery in time for Christmas. At the same time, Whirly-Go-Round is hand-crafted and assembled here in Texas. We want to devote the time and careful attention to deliver with the best possible quality. You've heard the terms, ""military-grade,"" ""medical-grade,"" and the like? To us, ""child-grade"" deserves the highest level of care and diligence.
 
Timeline



Risks & Challenges
Over the past year we have designed and redesigned about 17 different versions. This try, try again philosophy means we've taken most of the risk on ourselves before bringing it to you for backing. The result; we have successfully produced nine prototypes. This followed a rigorous testing process with children that allowed us to identify further design and performance improvements that we fine-tuned and included in your Whirly-Go-Round.
We have worked diligently to ready this product for IndieGoGo and fulfillment, but here are what we see as the risks and our plan to handle them:BAMBOO:  We have lined up at least three suppliers who have been able to produce high quality bamboo to our specifications and whose samples we have used and approved. These suppliers have confirmed they are ready to produce and any one of them can supply the amounts we need. We can forsee some risk the Covid virus might return as an issue in China. In the event it does, it would not prevent delivery of orders but could delay them.
Every other component is available in the U.S. Our fabrication, assembly and shipping will all be accomplished in house. That means all those steps are under our control so there is little to no risk of delay on these.FULFILLMENT: In general, stuff happens that can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, customs clearance or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. We are using the United States Postal Service to bring Whirly-Go-Round to your door.. We’ll keep open and honest communication with you through our process so you know where your product is and when it’s going to get to you.
We have worked hard to prevent any delays in delivering Whirly-Go-Round. We feel our delivery goal is attainable because:

We have sourced multiple suppliers and successfully tested their samples for quality and suitability. We have tested samples from four capable suppliers.
There is no shortage of bamboo or hardware.

 
Please Pass the Word

<p><strong>In Only 2 Steps</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Attach Levitate Hanger set to the back of your picture.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Push your picture onto the wall.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> (optional): Rotate as needed. Or just for fun ;)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We asked people if they hang pictures on their walls. Obviously, some said yes and some said no.</p>
<p><i><strong>Levitate:</strong> Why not?</i></p>
<p><i><strong>The People:</strong> Honestly? Pure laziness.</i></p>
<p><i>Can you guess what we replied with?</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Levitate: </strong>Perfect!</i></p>
<p>One of the main reasons people are not hanging pictures on their walls is laziness.  It's not something to be ashamed of if you are too lazy to hang you pictures.  We get it.  We have so many other priorities in life, so we say ""we'll hang these pictures some other time"", but we never do.</p>
<p>Being lazy about hanging pictures is not because we are lazy people, it's because of what it takes to hang them: taking measurements, finding our tool kits, drilling/hammering into the wall, leveling, needing the help of others, cleaning afterwards etc.</p>
<p><strong>Introducing Levitate Hanger!</strong></p>
<p>Now, you can finally hang your pictures in 10 seconds or less!</p>
<p>With Levitate Hanger you follow only two steps: attaching one part of the hanger on the picture and attaching the other part of the hanger on the wall. A third step is optional - rotate as needed.</p>
<p>No more measuring, using tools, finding help, leveling or cleaning.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564470484/pbnjxsqbywur6zrv9sok.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>One of the things you can't do with other picture hangers is hang other stuff, like tablets, phones, small cameras, decorative plates etc.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564470506/puvse2q2p3sf7pfknwpu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Levitate Hanger is today's quickest and most versatile solution for hanging your pictures. Thanks to Levitate Hanger, you can hang pictures in just 10 seconds AND have it perfectly leveled on your wall. </p>
<p>No more nails, picture wire, measuring and pencil marks. You can even easily rotate between portrait and landscape orientations.</p>
<p>Levitate Hanger is mess-free and reusable. If you ever want to move or take down a picture, pull the adhesives downwards to release the hanger from the wall. It will not damage your wall or the hanger and you'll be able to reuse Levitate Hanger over and over.</p>
<p>Its unique design makes easy to use and enables you to hang more than pictures. Hang your tablets, smart phones, smart home devices, etc. too.</p>
<p>Back our project now to help us revolutionize how we hang pictures, and experience first-hand how Levitate Hanger can make this part of your life much easier and more creative.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564470547/utuur92xoj4aueyauiov.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We designed Levitate Hanger to solve what most picture hangers lack.  This made Levitate Hanger the most versatile hanger out there.</p>
<h3> 1. Hang any picture, tablet or phone in 10 seconds or less</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564470612/igjysh34djnaz3ks0ftw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>2. Rotating 360 degrees and stops at any desired angle</h3>
<p>Levitate Hanger is the only picture hanger out there that lets you rotate your pictures 360 degrees.  What is it good for? Tilting your picture left or right, post hanging, is important for not needing to use any leveling tools.  We could have stopped there, but we didn't want to limit YOUR creativity.  What if you have art works that can hang horizontally and vertically?  Heck, what if you have abstract images that can be presented upside down, downside up, left side right etc?</p>
<p>Creativity is one of the most important traits we have, and we at Levitate Hanger definitely don't want to limit that.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564470630/jucbgqw4hog0loxfhsyx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>3. Change pictures without replacing all hangers</h3>
<p>If you ever used other picture hanger systems, you probably know, in order to put up a different size picture you had to replace the hanger on the wall or replace the hanging system if they are both on the wall and on the picture.  Other than making you waste precious time and money it also added trash to our environment.</p>
<p>With Levitate Hanger you can change pictures to any size you want.  Replacement is done in matter of seconds, and you create far less trash than before!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564470659/cujorftu9sacwbsqed7f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>4. One size fits all</h3>
<p>We design for the future. After this campaign we're planning on manufacturing different sizes of Levitate Hangers.  With that in mind, we don't want you to waste money on a whole new system and create more waste.  Instead, you'll be able to purchase different sizes of the Slider, while using the same holder.</p>
<p>Why different sizes of the Slider? If you want to hang smaller things like lightweight pictures, phones.  It will save you money and help our planet stay cleaner.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564470686/po0zbyodrnrclwhlowib.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>5. Hangs more than only pictures</h3>
<p>Remember creativity?  Why hang only pictures Levitate Hanger allows you to hang almost anything with a flat surface?</p>
<p>With Levitate Hanger, you can hang your tablet and set it free.  We know tablets are very powerful when they are in different orientation.  The ability to rotate your tablet 360 degrees lets your tablet unleash its real purpose.</p>
<p>Why stop at tablets? Hang your smart phone too.  Hang it in your car, on the kitchen cabinet, on the wall near your bed, your screen's mount, your refrigerator, your desk, your mirror, your car's window.  Wherever you want!</p>
<h3>6. Leaves damage-free walls</h3>
<p>Another reason Levitate Hanger was created is to leave your walls free of damage.  Drilling and hammering into your walls ruins and weakens them and if you do that a lot, you'll get to a point where you have no more space to put nails and screws in. Besides, ""Swiss cheese walls"" are not fun to look at and they are not fun to fix when the time comes.</p>
<p>This feature eliminates risks of hitting wiring, pipes etc and there's no need to locate a wall stud.  These are common problems when using nails and hooks. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564470712/ozszenvrltgfbvnhpqkp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>7. Reusable (because we love this planet!)</h3>
<p>When created Levitate Hanger decided we don't want anyone to ever through it away and make unnecessary trash.  Making it a reusable hanger was the ultimate solution.  If one day you don't want/need to use it anymore, you can just hand it out or sell it.</p>
<p>If you wish to move your picture from one side of the wall to another, there's no need to throw it away and purchase a new Levitate Hanger.  You simply replace the adhesives, attach the Slider on the picture and the Holder on the wall. Done!</p>
<h3>8. Can hold up to 20lbs</h3>
<p>Size doesn't matter. Weight does. Your pictures, tablets etc can be as large as they can get, but if they weigh 20lbs or less you can hang them with Levitate Hanger.</p>
<h3>9. Pictures are ""floating""/""levitating""</h3>
<p>rather than flush on the wall or with an angle.  This gives room for some extra creativity when it comes to interior design.  More on that in the near future.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564470731/i3vswkh1oazonrjkztlt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564470750/pfre4x8qpgjqtfd75gso.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By making Levitate Hanger rotate 360 degrees we eliminate the need for leveling before and/or after you hang the picture and by making Levitate Hanger hold up to 20lbs without any nails, screws etc we eliminate all measuring.  You simply push the picture onto your desired spot on the wall.  No need to measure distance from the floor, ceiling, sides etc.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564470770/uq3j9yyhms6oxn3aqam2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Should you really use it? We'll let you to decide if you want to hang your pictures (or tablets) with little to no effort. </p>
<h2>Why Was Levitate Hanger Born?</h2>
<p>As a landscape and fine art photographer I print many of the photographs I capture and usually have them framed or mounted on acrylic, metal, foam board etc and when it's time to hang those photos on the wall I procrastinate. A lot!</p>
<p>I knew I needed to get my tool kit that included tape measure, level, hammer, nails, hooks, wires, screws and anchors.  Not to mention the cleaning that had to come after.  To ditch the tool kit I looked for other solutions.  The solutions I found were OK, but OK is not good enough!  I was able to hang some photos with adhesives only, but I had to have someone tell me if the picture is straight while I was slowly pushing it on the wall because once it was up I couldn't make any adjustments.</p>
<p>If I didn't have any help I had to balance a level on the picture while slowly pushing it on the wall.  Sometimes it fell, sometimes it didn't.  One thing is for sure. It was ANNOYING!</p>
<p>As per hooks and nails, I had to measure the distance between the wire, the picture and the wall.  After finally hanging it, the picture was at an angle, sticking out of the wall at the top.  Sometimes the hook/nail was visible above the picture which is not such a beautiful sight.</p>
<p>There had to be something better!  Well... there wasn't.</p>
<p>Since I come from the design world I started sketching up potential solutions.  Suddenly it came to me, the simplest thing no one thought about (for some strange reason).  Make it tilt AFTER I hang the picture.  Easier said than done.  </p>
<p>Everything in the design had to work in perfect harmony.  The shape, the functionality, the size.  Everything.  After a few good designs that already worked (theoretically) I got the final design I was happy with and sent it to my brother so he could model it in a 3D software and print a prototype.</p>
<p>Guess what? It was working better than I expected.  Hence the reason you're reading about this kickstarter campaign.</p>

If you ever used other picture hanger systems, you probably know, in order to put up a different size picture you had to replace the hanger on the wall or replace the hanging system if they are both on the wall and on the picture.  Other than making you waste precious time and money it also added trash to our environment.
With Levitate Hanger you can change pictures to any size you want.  Replacement is done in matter of seconds, and you create far less trash than before!

4. One size fits all
We design for the future. After this campaign we're planning on manufacturing different sizes of Levitate Hangers.  With that in mind, we don't want you to waste money on a whole new system and create more waste.  Instead, you'll be able to purchase different sizes of the Slider, while using the same holder.
Why different sizes of the Slider? If you want to hang smaller things like lightweight pictures, phones.  It will save you money and help our planet stay cleaner.

5. Hangs more than only pictures
Remember creativity?  Why hang only pictures Levitate Hanger allows you to hang almost anything with a flat surface?
With Levitate Hanger, you can hang your tablet and set it free.  We know tablets are very powerful when they are in different orientation.  The ability to rotate your tablet 360 degrees lets your tablet unleash its real purpose.
Why stop at tablets? Hang your smart phone too.  Hang it in your car, on the kitchen cabinet, on the wall near your bed, your screen's mount, your refrigerator, your desk, your mirror, your car's window.  Wherever you want!
6. Leaves damage-free walls
Another reason Levitate Hanger was created is to leave your walls free of damage.  Drilling and hammering into your walls ruins and weakens them and if you do that a lot, you'll get to a point where you have no more space to put nails and screws in. Besides, ""Swiss cheese walls"" are not fun to look at and they are not fun to fix when the time comes.
This feature eliminates risks of hitting wiring, pipes etc and there's no need to locate a wall stud.  These are common problems when using nails and hooks. 

7. Reusable (because we love this planet!)
When created Levitate Hanger decided we don't want anyone to ever through it away and make unnecessary trash.  Making it a reusable hanger was the ultimate solution.  If one day you don't want/need to use it anymore, you can just hand it out or sell it.
If you wish to move your picture from one side of the wall to another, there's no need to throw it away and purchase a new Levitate Hanger.  You simply replace the adhesives, attach the Slider on the picture and the Holder on the wall. Done!
8. Can hold up to 20lbs
Size doesn't matter. Weight does. Your pictures, tablets etc can be as large as they can get, but if they weigh 20lbs or less you can hang them with Levitate Hanger.
9. Pictures are ""floating""/""levitating""
rather than flush on the wall or with an angle.  This gives room for some extra creativity when it comes to interior design.  More on that in the near future.


By making Levitate Hanger rotate 360 degrees we eliminate the need for leveling before and/or after you hang the picture and by making Levitate Hanger hold up to 20lbs without any nails, screws etc we eliminate all measuring.  You simply push the picture onto your desired spot on the wall.  No need to measure distance from the floor, ceiling, sides etc.  

Should you really use it? We'll let you to decide if you want to hang your pictures (or tablets) with little to no effort. 
Why Was Levitate Hanger Born?
As a landscape and fine art photographer I print many of the photographs I capture and usually have them framed or mounted on acrylic, metal, foam board etc and when it's time to hang those photos on the wall I procrastinate. A lot!
I knew I needed to get my tool kit that included tape measure, level, hammer, nails, hooks, wires, screws and anchors.  Not to mention the cleaning that had to come after.  To ditch the tool kit I looked for other solutions.  The solutions I found were OK, but OK is not good enough!  I was able to hang some photos with adhesives only, but I had to have someone tell me if the picture is straight while I was slowly pushing it on the wall because once it was up I couldn't make any adjustments.
If I didn't have any help I had to balance a level on the picture while slowly pushing it on the wall.  Sometimes it fell, sometimes it didn't.  One thing is for sure. It was ANNOYING!
As per hooks and nails, I had to measure the distance between the wire, the picture and the wall.  After finally hanging it, the picture was at an angle, sticking out of the wall at the top.  Sometimes the hook/nail was visible above the picture which is not such a beautiful sight.
There had to be something better!  Well... there wasn't.
Since I come from the design world I started sketching up potential solutions.  Suddenly it came to me, the simplest thing no one thought about (for some strange reason).  Make it tilt AFTER I hang the picture.  Easier said than done.  
Everything in the design had to work in perfect harmony.  The shape, the functionality, the size.  Everything.  After a few good designs that already worked (theoretically) I got the final design I was happy with and sent it to my brother so he could model it in a 3D software and print a prototype.
Guess what? It was working better than I expected.  Hence the reason you're reading about this kickstarter campaign.

        brightup ermöglicht das automatisieren, steuern und personalisieren der Beleuchtung Zuhause. Es ist ohne jeglichen Aufwand zu installieren und bietet kontextbasierte Automatisierung, d.h. es nutzt alle verfügbaren Informationen, wie Sonnen Auf- und Untergangszeiten und Ihren Standort, um die Beleuchtung entsprechend anzupassen. Mit dem brightup App ist es sehr einfach und für jeden möglich dieses Verhalten nach Ihren Wünschen einzustellen.
    

        Verbinden Sie einfach Ihre bestehende Lampe mit einem brightup Gerät und stellen Sie den Alarm mit dem Smartphone ein. brightup weckt Sie sanft zur gewünschten Zeit durch langsames Heraufdimmen Ihrer Lampen.
    

        Stecken Sie Ihren Fernseher in einen brightup Stecker. Wenn Sie den Fernseher nun anschalten, bemerkt dieser einen Anstieg im Energieverbrauch. Die Zentraleinheit nutz diese Information und aktiviert die voreingestellte Fernsehbeleuchtung.
    

        Mit brightup können Sie Ihre Lampen mit verschiedenen Helligkeiten zu Szenarien gruppieren. Diese können anschließend abgespeichert und jederzeit über die App mit einem Klick wieder aktiviert werden.
    

        brightup's cleverer Algorithmus integriert Wetterinformationen und weiß, wann es draußen dunkel ist. Wenn Sie zu dieser Zeit nicht zu Hause sind, schaltet brightup in zufälliger Abfolge Lampen an.
    

        brightup bietet kontextbasierte Automatisierung ohne jeglichen Installationsaufwand. Alle anderen Systeme dieser Preiskategorie bieten lediglich Fernsteuerung über das Smartphone, was bedeutet, dass Sie dieses jedes Mal herausholen müssen, um das Licht anzumachen.
    

        brightup geht einen Schritt weiter und bietet echte Automatisierung!
    










        Wir vier haben eine doppelten Masterabschluss in Ingenieurwesen und Management. Seit 2012 arbeiten wir an dem Konzept von brightup und haben seit dem ein großartiges Team aus Software- und Hardware Entwicklern und Produkt- und Grafikdesignern aufgebaut.
    

        Wir haben die Entwicklung der Prototypen der Hardware und der Apps abgeschlossen und brauchen nun Ihre Hilfe, um brightup Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen. Mit dem gesammelten Geld können wir die Kosten für die Spritzgussformen und die Fertigstellung der Apps bezahlen.
    

Seien Sie dabei und machen Sie es möglich!


        Produktion: Um die Risiken während der Produktion zu minimieren, haben wir von Anfang an mit möglichen Partern zusammengearbeitet, um alle Schritte, Mengen und Kosten genau absehen zu können.
    

        Lieferkette: Die Lieferzeiten für alle Komponenten wurden mehrfach überprüft und mehrere Lieferanten ausgewählt.
    

        Hardware & Software Integration: Von Anfang an haben wir durch direkte Abstimmung dafür gesorgt, das Risiko für die gleichzeitige Entwicklung von Hardware und Software zu reduzieren.
    


Werden die Stecker in den USA funktionieren?
            Nein. Die aktuelle Version mit Stecker-Typ CEE7/7 „Schuko“ funktioniert in den meisten Ländern Europas.
        

Welche Glühlampen können gedimmt werden?
            Die brightup Stecker und der Unterputz-Dimmer können normale Glühbirnen und Halogen-Lampen bis zu 300 W dimmen. Neuere LED-Lampen und Energiesparlampen können auch an das System angeschlossen und oft auch gedimmt werden. Hierbei kommt es aber im Einzelfall auf die Lampe an.
        

In welchen Ländern Europas funktioniert der Stecker?
            Der brightup Stecker funktioniert in den meisten europäischen Ländern außer Zypern, Dänemark, Italien, Irland, Malta, Schweiz und Vereintes Königreich. Schreib uns, wenn Du nicht sicher bist ob das brightup System in Deinem Land funktioniert.
        

Fallen monatliche Nutzungsgebühren an?
            Unsere Indiegogo-Besteller bekommen komplett freien Zugang für unsere App und die Cloud.
        

Wie sicher ist das System?
            Das System ist so sicher wie das Online-Banking von Deiner Bank. Unsere Technologien sind auf dem neusten Stand der Technik und benutzen SSL und OAuth 2.0, um die Sicherheit des Systems rundum zu gewährleisten.
        

English Version:






Eclipse bundle: Our brightup central unit and smart plug are now available in shiny black. The Eclipse bundle includes a central unit and three plugs for 249€. This offer is available only on indiegogo.
    



        brightup is connected hardware that allows you to automate, customize and remote control your lights at home.
        It comes with zero effort installation and context-aware automation. It uses all available information like the position of the sun and your location to create the best lighting in your home. With the brightup app, it is very easy to set automation rules. The most common ones are already pre-defined for you!
    

        Just connect your existing lamp to a brightup device and set an alarm in your smartphone. brightup will wake you up gently at the set wake up time by gradually dimming up the connected lamps.
    

        Connect your TV to a brightup plug. When you now turn on your TV, the brightup plug notices the increase in electrical consumption. The central unit uses this information to trigger your pre-set TV light scenario.
    

        With brightup you can group your lamps with different brightness levels to light scenarios. Save your scenarios and activate it with the app when needed with just one touch.
    

        brightup's clever algorithm integrates weather information and knows when it is dark outside. If you're not home at this time, brightup turns on your lamps in a random way.
    

        brightup is unique due to its zero installation effort and the context-aware automation. All other systems in this price range only offer a smartphone-based remote control for your lamps, which means you have to take out your phone every time you want to switch on a lamp.
    

        brightup goes beyond that and offers real automation!
    










        The four of us have a double degree masters in Management and Engineering. We have been working on the concept of brightup since 2012 and built up an amazing team of software and hardware developers along with product & graphic designers.
    

        We developed the prototypes of the hardware and the apps. With your support we can bring brightup to life. The money we raise through the campaign will be used for tooling and finalising the apps.
    

Join us to make this happen!


        Manufacturing: To minimize the risk in Manufacturing, we collaborated early with potential manufacturing partners and this helped us establish the time, cost and volumes required for production.
    

        Supply Chain/Sourcing: Lead times for every individual element in the bill of materials has been verified and wherever possible dual suppliers have been identified.
    

        Hardware & Software integration: We paid close attention to this risk from the beginning and from our current state of development are confident that this risk is minimal.

<p>Notifon is a wireless Internet of Things device. It uses ZigBee to communicate. ZigBee is a low powered technology, made for the IoT world. The transmit power is 15 times lower than the WiFi for the same range.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 10px; font-size: 24px; font-family: HelveticaNeue-UltraLight, Helvetica, Arial; color: #dd4813;"">Battery life</p>
<p>Don't even think about it. The battery in each Node will last between two to five years depending on your usage. Once depleted, the battery used in Notifon is a commonly found in any convenience or electronics store (type CR2032).</p>
<p>Our first prototype has been working since february 2013 even though it transmits more than 20 notifications per day!</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 10px; font-size: 24px; font-family: HelveticaNeue-UltraLight, Helvetica, Arial; color: #dd4813;"">Extendable</p>
<p>You can connect up to 14 Nodes with one Hub. Just put the battery in and it's ready to use.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: 10px; font-size: 24px; font-family: HelveticaNeue-UltraLight, Helvetica, Arial; color: #dd4813;"">Power consumption</p>
<p>The power consumption of the Hub is less than 0.2W, that's about $0.20 per year :-)</p>

Notifon is a push-notification device that connects you to your home and office wherever you are.
Notifon sends you instant alerts on your SmartPhone, Email, Twitter, or even Karotz when a real life event occurs at your home or office.
Use cases
Garage door

Mailbox
Switch button
Water leak detector

Other use cases...

Know when your kids are back home by putting Notifon on your entry door.
Get notified when somebody rings at your doorbell.
Build a cool Twittering toaster like @mytoaster.
Set up a Notifying Cat Door for your cat! (cc @PepitoTheCat)
Tell your customers when your store is open or closed by sending a tweet.
Know when someone opens the fridge, your safe or the guns cabinet.
Use it as a cheap alarm system for your rented flat.
In fact, Notifon is universal. Your imagination is the limit!
What do notifications look like?
Here is what a notification looks like on an iPhone, a WindowsPhone, an Android Phone, an iPad and a Karotz. Text-to-Speech function is available for Android Phones and Karotz.



Safari Push Notification on MacOSX Mavericks:

Notification on Windows 8:

Notification on a Pebble SmartWatch:

Other kinds of notifications:

Email.
Twitter.
Custom HTTP GET/POST request.
Many more to come...

Notifon and Web Camera
If you own an Internet Web Camera, you can attach real time pictures to your Email and Tweet notifications.
The Cloud
Two years ago we launched PushingBox, a cloud service where you can manage your notifications. You can configure each real life event to trigger multiple actions such as Push+Tweet+Email. All this in real time!
PushingBox is already used by thousands of registered users who have their own triggering hardware. We have sent millions of notifications since 2012.
What does Notifon looks like?
Notifon is smart, small and beautiful. With a curved white glossy design, Notifon is the kind of technology you don't want to hide.
Notifon comes with one Hub and one or more Node(s). The Hub is an internet-connected gateway that communicates wirelessly with the Nodes(s), and passes on the notifications to the Cloud.
Tech Specs
Dimensions
Wireless technology
Notifon is a wireless Internet of Things device. It uses ZigBee to communicate. ZigBee is a low powered technology, made for the IoT world. The transmit power is 15 times lower than the WiFi for the same range.
Battery life
Don't even think about it. The battery in each Node will last between two to five years depending on your usage. Once depleted, the battery used in Notifon is a commonly found in any convenience or electronics store (type CR2032).
Our first prototype has been working since february 2013 even though it transmits more than 20 notifications per day!
Extendable
You can connect up to 14 Nodes with one Hub. Just put the battery in and it's ready to use.
Power consumption
The power consumption of the Hub is less than 0.2W, that's about $0.20 per year :-)
Sensors
Notifon is universal. You can use any sensor that has two states, such as a switch, a push button, a magnetic door switch, a relay... Notifon allows you to predefine a set of actions for each state.
Simplicity
Simplicity is key! We worked very hard to design and build a product so simple that anyone who knows how to create a Facebook account should be able to set up Notifon.
Essentially, this is all you need to do:

Plug the power and Ethernet cable to the Hub.
Register the Node into the Cloud by entering his serial number (called the DeviceID).
Add action(s) into each Scenario, such as : Send to my phone ""The door is open"".
Place the Node on the object you want to transform into a notifying object.
Perks for Indiegogo contributors
Where we are in development?
We already have the working prototype, final enclosure, Cloud service and we're now focused on:

Final board review.
Customizations options on PushingBox.
Hiring talented individuals to join the team.
We will soon begin the process of:

Producing a small batch of PCB.
Designing the supply chain process.
Tooling.
Materials procurement.
Designing the packaging.
Launching the production with your help!
Risks and challenges
Launching a mass production from a prototype is a huge challenge, and we are well aware of it.
We are already making dozens of prototypes that have been tested by our beta testers and our first prototype has been working well since february 2013. 
We have contacts for mass PCB production, enclosures and the plastic injection molds are ready to be built. 
To simplify the production, we will be doing the programming and shipping in-house.
We are using a ZigBee Module that is FCC, IC, ETSI, CE, RoHS certified.
Because of that we'll save months of work and thousands of dollars on certification fees.
The cloud has been working for two years and has successfully sent millions of notifications to subscribing users.
All we need now is your support!

With an efficient design in the consumption of water. And considerably saving the use of paper roll and money.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>INTRODUCING THE BUSHWICK SMART HOME COLLECTION</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Bushwick Smart Home Collection</strong> from the innovative Brooklyn-based chandelier studio  <strong><a href=""http://www.michaelmchaledesigns.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Michael McHale Designs</a></strong> is a set of gorgeous lights and lamps for your tech-enabled interior.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>All these lights feature a simple yet striking set of frames and a double wall of crystal to create a centerpiece which is simple yet luxurious. Each works beautifully as a conventional light.</p>
<p>But they are designed to become, at your option, the center of your smart home. They are designed to house your <strong>Amazon Alexa Echo Dot</strong> or <strong>Google Home Mini</strong> (not included). Install your smart device inside of your Bushwick Light and you've hidden all those wires, plugs and boxes associated with smart home tech inside a gorgeous piece of high-end lighting design; You've also positioned those microphones and speakers exactly where audio professionals recommend: <i><strong>in the middle of the room</strong></i>  while enhancing rather than compromising your interior aesthetics.</p>
<p>When you install your smart home device into the light along with smart bulbs from companies such as <strong>Philips Hue</strong>, <strong>LIFX</strong>, or <strong>Cree</strong> the magic starts to happen. Now, your Bushwick Smart Home Light can turn off and on at the sound of your voice, change colors, or, at your command, pulsate with your music. The double-wall of pure crystal heightens the effects and colors of the smart bulbs and turns the LED signals on the smart device itself into a satisfying refracted flourish of light and color.</p>
<p>All Bushwick Smart Home Lights are designed to be future-proof: they will be able to carry whatever new home tech comes down the pike, including the rumored Apple Mini Home Pod. We can even adapt any Bushwick fixture to become a <strong>Powered over Ethernet</strong> (or <strong>""PoE""</strong>) device -- the first PoE decorative lighting solution out there (ask us about it). This is all cutting-edge stuff.</p>
<p>While we normally work with expensive, high quality gem-cut crystal, for this campaign we are offering all Bushwick Collection lights in K9 Borosilicate Crown Crystal, a more affordable option which will make Bushwick Collection lights available to more people.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who We Are</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Michael McHale Designs</strong> was founded in <strong>2007</strong> with the idea that contemporary decorative lighting needed new ideas. We wanted to push the envelope as to what lighting could do both  aesthetically and functionally. We were at the vanguard of the industrial-chic trend in lighting -- making chandeliers, lamps, sconces, and pendants from rough-hewn gas pipes and fittings which were then drenched in high-quality glamorous crystal to create a complex studies in materials, structure, and contrast.</p>

<p><strong> Call to Action.  </strong>Would you please help our cause by purchasing a book and sending it to the Department of Corrections and prison Wardens nationwide? </p>
<p>We need you and all interested in supporting, approving, and implementing a change to allow inmates to make money selling their art to pay their restitution, child support, and other societal debts.  At the same time, the program Art for Redemption would also allow inmates to have dollars to stay in touch with family and friends; the potential to build savings for when they are released supports the significant goal of reducing recidivism.  </p>
<p>We have worked with Executive Director Dean Williams her win Colorado to put those changes in place. He is writing the fwd of the book and a letter addressed to these individuals on why he has made those changes here in Colorado, hoping to get others to do the same. </p>
<p>Our coffee table book is what we believe will be the best way to showcase the art and the words of this program and opportunity.  The American criminal justice system holds almost 2.3 million people in 1,833 state prisons, 110 federal prisons.  It’s too many people, a crumbling old model of justice, and our Prison System must reform. (Mass Incarceration: The Whole Pie 2020 | Prison Policy Initiativehttps://<a href=""http://www.prisonpolicy.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.prisonpolicy.org</a> › reports › pie2020)</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<ul><li>Art for Redemption is a network of individuals seeking to connect and bridge friends, families, Prison Administrators, and other interested parties to create pathways of success from the “inside out” through art production.  The organization was founded by a formerly incarcerated individual who believed there was a way to celebrate the artistic talent “inside” and to encourage financial accountability of art producing inmates through the potential sale of their works towards paying restitution, child support, commissary, phone calls, J-Pay fees (institutional email), and even potentially be savings to support reintegration once released.  Colorado approved vendor status for Art for Redemption to support achieving these goals.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Our campaign is to build awareness and financial support to produce our coffee table book featuring Works of Art from the incarcerated, letters from Prison Administrators regarding this initiative’s breakthrough opportunity.  These efforts and outcomes directly support family members in their challenges regarding the stigma and hardship they experience when loved ones are incarcerated.  It also supports reduced recidivism by supporting pathways of success and growth through the experience in the justice system. We are looking to broaden and strengthen our network through financial support. We believe this effort is critical to prison reform and social justice.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>Your contribution will be a part of transforming pathways through the justice system and support prison reform.  By expanding and broadening awareness and support, we can support those who can learn from their mistakes and participate in our civil society as a part of the greater community.  We hope you will join us.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>NEED</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$25,000 will produce the book into a printable file. This includes all the layout, editorial writing, etc...  </li>
<li>$25,000 for operational funds for the company. This will get us more robust Print On Demand (POD) and NFT platforms and funds to communicate with the artist, social media marketing, etc... </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><b>PATHWAYS (PURCHASES) YOU CAN TAKE TO HELP US REACH OUR GOAL:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>$500 - book with an original artwork that is showcased in the book (50 Available)</li>
<li>$165 - Buy a book send a book to a warden or DOC head (2000 Available)</li>
<li>$170 - Buy a book send a book to an artist/(or family member) that is in the book (includes shipping) (100 Available)</li>
<li>$80 Book with shipping (100 Available)</li>
<li>$30 AFR T-shirt </li>
<li>$25 - Mural Print w/ Augmented Reality (AR) tech </li>
</ul>
<p>What if we don’t meet our goal?  If we don't reach our entire goal - the book will scale down from 100 artists to the number that we can produce with funds raised</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Breaking through the stigmas, preconceived ideas about what it means when someone has been incarcerated.  Incarceration is a big, scary, large encompassing word.  Prison triggers broad ranges of imagination about what it is like.  Breaking down stigmas and uncovering potential opportunities to diminish incarceration by reducing recidivism.  </p>
<p>The personal and human impact is that this effort opens up the conversation around how incarceration impacts the individual and the community, family, and friends.  This project aims to provide a sense of possibility and something to work on, something to share.  It is an opportunity to help people stay in touch, maintain, and potentially build a support system that is deeply needed when released. </p>
<p>Revenue earned by the Artists from the sales of their works would:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restitution payment for victims </li>
<li>Child support - if there is </li>
<li>Build some financial independence while serving time to reduce the further drain on the family eco-system </li>
</ul>
<p>Founder, Buck Adams, has a track record of bringing concepts to fruition with previous ventures, Veterans to Farmers, circle fresh farms, and other endeavors.  In each case, the commitment to new models and service to the community has met needs and demands.   </p>
<ul><li>But for building trust in relationships through hardships like experiencing prison, anyone could find themselves alone.  Buck Adams’ desire to share lessons from his experience in prison to support others navigating their experience has been built from his gratefulness to his friends and family.  All involved learn, heal and hope for a better future ahead.  We are grateful for the support that will come from this campaign.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Not everyone likes people who have been to prison.  Some feel that they deserve whatever comes to them due to their infractions.  We hope that through the art and conversations of the artists' diverse backgrounds, we could open people’s minds to be open to potential ways to support successful reintegration and participation in community good.  There are few incarcerated people who do not seek a second chance.  We hope this effort will support those who have learned from their mistakes and want to be a part of the community at large as contributors. </p>
<ul>
<li>Art for Redemption has built support of individuals inside and outside of Prison.  Administrators in the Prison system believe this project to be a pathway worth supporting.</li>
<li>We will continue to be open to dialogue, criticism, learning, sharing, and transparency.  These are the building blocks for any kind of trust.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Would you please share with your friends and networks?  We are relying on our supporters to share what we are doing.  </li>

<p> </p>
<p>THANK YOU</p>
</div></div>","Call to Action.  Would you please help our cause by purchasing a book and sending it to the Department of Corrections and prison Wardens nationwide? 
We need you and all interested in supporting, approving, and implementing a change to allow inmates to make money selling their art to pay their restitution, child support, and other societal debts.  At the same time, the program Art for Redemption would also allow inmates to have dollars to stay in touch with family and friends; the potential to build savings for when they are released supports the significant goal of reducing recidivism.  
We have worked with Executive Director Dean Williams her win Colorado to put those changes in place. He is writing the fwd of the book and a letter addressed to these individuals on why he has made those changes here in Colorado, hoping to get others to do the same. 
Our coffee table book is what we believe will be the best way to showcase the art and the words of this program and opportunity.  The American criminal justice system holds almost 2.3 million people in 1,833 state prisons, 110 federal prisons.  It’s too many people, a crumbling old model of justice, and our Prison System must reform. (Mass Incarceration: The Whole Pie 2020 | Prison Policy Initiativehttps://www.prisonpolicy.org › reports › pie2020)
 
Summary
Art for Redemption is a network of individuals seeking to connect and bridge friends, families, Prison Administrators, and other interested parties to create pathways of success from the “inside out” through art production.  The organization was founded by a formerly incarcerated individual who believed there was a way to celebrate the artistic talent “inside” and to encourage financial accountability of art producing inmates through the potential sale of their works towards paying restitution, child support, commissary, phone calls, J-Pay fees (institutional email), and even potentially be savings to support reintegration once released.  Colorado approved vendor status for Art for Redemption to support achieving these goals.
 
Our campaign is to build awareness and financial support to produce our coffee table book featuring Works of Art from the incarcerated, letters from Prison Administrators regarding this initiative’s breakthrough opportunity.  These efforts and outcomes directly support family members in their challenges regarding the stigma and hardship they experience when loved ones are incarcerated.  It also supports reduced recidivism by supporting pathways of success and growth through the experience in the justice system. We are looking to broaden and strengthen our network through financial support. We believe this effort is critical to prison reform and social justice.
 
Your contribution will be a part of transforming pathways through the justice system and support prison reform.  By expanding and broadening awareness and support, we can support those who can learn from their mistakes and participate in our civil society as a part of the greater community.  We hope you will join us.

 
What We Need & What You Get
NEED

$25,000 will produce the book into a printable file. This includes all the layout, editorial writing, etc...  
$25,000 for operational funds for the company. This will get us more robust Print On Demand (POD) and NFT platforms and funds to communicate with the artist, social media marketing, etc... 

 
PATHWAYS (PURCHASES) YOU CAN TAKE TO HELP US REACH OUR GOAL:

$500 - book with an original artwork that is showcased in the book (50 Available)
$165 - Buy a book send a book to a warden or DOC head (2000 Available)
$170 - Buy a book send a book to an artist/(or family member) that is in the book (includes shipping) (100 Available)
$80 Book with shipping (100 Available)
$30 AFR T-shirt 
$25 - Mural Print w/ Augmented Reality (AR) tech 

What if we don’t meet our goal?  If we don't reach our entire goal - the book will scale down from 100 artists to the number that we can produce with funds raised

The Impact
Breaking through the stigmas, preconceived ideas about what it means when someone has been incarcerated.  Incarceration is a big, scary, large encompassing word.  Prison triggers broad ranges of imagination about what it is like.  Breaking down stigmas and uncovering potential opportunities to diminish incarceration by reducing recidivism.  
The personal and human impact is that this effort opens up the conversation around how incarceration impacts the individual and the community, family, and friends.  This project aims to provide a sense of possibility and something to work on, something to share.  It is an opportunity to help people stay in touch, maintain, and potentially build a support system that is deeply needed when released. 
Revenue earned by the Artists from the sales of their works would:

Restitution payment for victims 
Child support - if there is 
Build some financial independence while serving time to reduce the further drain on the family eco-system 

Founder, Buck Adams, has a track record of bringing concepts to fruition with previous ventures, Veterans to Farmers, circle fresh farms, and other endeavors.  In each case, the commitment to new models and service to the community has met needs and demands.   
But for building trust in relationships through hardships like experiencing prison, anyone could find themselves alone.  Buck Adams’ desire to share lessons from his experience in prison to support others navigating their experience has been built from his gratefulness to his friends and family.  All involved learn, heal and hope for a better future ahead.  We are grateful for the support that will come from this campaign.
 

Risks & Challenges
Not everyone likes people who have been to prison.  Some feel that they deserve whatever comes to them due to their infractions.  We hope that through the art and conversations of the artists' diverse backgrounds, we could open people’s minds to be open to potential ways to support successful reintegration and participation in community good.  There are few incarcerated people who do not seek a second chance.  We hope this effort will support those who have learned from their mistakes and want to be a part of the community at large as contributors. 

Art for Redemption has built support of individuals inside and outside of Prison.  Administrators in the Prison system believe this project to be a pathway worth supporting.
We will continue to be open to dialogue, criticism, learning, sharing, and transparency.  These are the building blocks for any kind of trust.

 

Other Ways You Can Help

Would you please share with your friends and networks?  We are relying on our supporters to share what we are doing.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Jordan Shao, and I am fundraising for a group of left behind Afghan interpreters and their families. These interpreters served honorably side by side with American forces while the United States were involved in Afghanistan. As everyone knows, we have passed the deadline of August 31st to pull all troops out. The last plane to leave Afghanistan has left. That means those allies that were left behind are left for dead and to fend for themselves. We have a moral obligation to help our allies and save them from Taliban executions. I am a Marine veteran who served in Afghanistan in 2009 and met my interpreter ""Wali"" while I was there. I was with Wali 24/7. I was assigned as his escort to everywhere he went. Interpreters embedded with American units were required to have an escort at all times.</p>
<p>My efforts started when I saw many big cities in Afghanistan were falling into the hands of the Taliban and Kabul were in great danger. After two weeks of trying to get his family on a flight to evacuate, we failed to do so due to the chaotic situation at the Kabul airport. Wali's family narrowly escaped death when the suicide bomber detonated the bomb at Abbey Gate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are we going to do to get these Afghan interpreters and family to safety:</strong></p>
<p>The funds raised will be used to pay for their transportation, housing, food, medical, visa application fees, and all other expenses needed to get them to safety. We are actively planning the route to a neighboring country so that they can continue to work on their application for visas or refugee status. Our target is $30,000 for a total for 30 Afghans consisted mostly of women and children. This is a dangerous path and we need to do whatever we can for these people to get them to safety. $10,000 is the estimated cost to get them to safety and $20,000 is the estimate to help resettle the families to the US or another country (administrative fees, expenses while waiting for approval, and flight costs)</p>
<p>During the two weeks of trying to get Wali's family into a flight, I have came across other Afghans that are at risk and I decided to help them along with trying to help Wali's family. I met Tamseella and Omar during this time and learned about their story and struggle to survive. I will tell their story along with Wali's story.</p>

<p><strong>Wali's story:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wali's family of 5 (Mother, 1 sister, 3 brothers) is still stuck in Kabul without a home, money or food of their own. They are hiding in Kabul with a family friend and are desperately trying to flee. All efforts to get them on the plane was unsuccessful and was beaten by Taliban fighters. Two of his brothers are still missing since the fall of Kabul and we don't know if they are dead or alive. We have communication with his mother, 1 brother, and 1 sister.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Omar's Story:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Omar served with American special forces from 2010 to 2012 as an interpreter. He went on missions with American soldiers on every occasion and routinely gets into fire fights and risk his life to save Americans. Everyone who served with him in Afghanistan will say that he is a honorable man and view him as a brother. When his employment with the contracting company that employed him lost the contract and left Afghanistan, he was left without documentations to prove his employment. Therefore, he has hit a wall on his application because he did not receive an HR letter confirming his employment with the American company. It is now 8 years since the company terminated his employment and still can not get his visa which he qualifies for. As a result of the Taliban take over, he is now in life threatening danger. If the Taliban finds him, he will be certainly executed in a terrible way. He is trying to escape with his cousin's wife and 2 kids that he is looking after.</p>

<p><strong>Tamseella's Story:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tamseella reached out to me on Facebook pleading for me to save her life and leave Afghanistan. Tamseella is a highly educated Afghan woman in her early 30's. She received a BA in business from a Afghanistan University and a MBA from an Indian University in 2020. After receiving her MBA, she returned to Afghanistan hoping to build her beloved country's economy. She was employed by the Department of Economic Development at the Presidential Palace in Kabul, directly for the President of Afghanistan. She worked for the Afghanistan government until Kabul fell to the Taliban. Tamseella had experience working with economic development projects funded by US government, a bank manager for Azizi bank, and a news channel in Kabul. Tamseella is among the most vulnerable group under Taliban rule; female, educated, and single. The fate that she if she stays in Afghanistan is rape, slavery, and forced marriage to a Taliban fighter. Tamseella is an avid reader with many New York Times best sellers such as ""Michelle Obama"" and ""Steve Jobs"" biography. She hopes to one day be able to live with dignity and freedom with the ability to follow her passion and heart.</p>

Those who worked with Azizi will normally say that he is a man of honor and can be relied on to be at the thick of battle. Z will not hesitate to come to his friends and allies aid in or out of combat. Azizi is currently in the process of the SIV process but have not received approval. Z is married with 7 children, with the oldest at 16 years and youngest at 4 years old.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Men's Magazine</h3>
<p>This is a magazine about Men. Unlike most other magazines, our focus will be on the needs of Men versus our need to make a profit or to appease advertisers. Our magazine is made by those of us who care.</p>
<p>This project is being headed up by Chris ""mad_cat"" Votey and Catherine McClain. Both have done work in the Men's Movement, including the Lovely Ladies of Men's Issues Calendar, which mad_cat co-created with Modern Medusa, and Catherine modeled for. They desire to do more for men which led to the creation of this magazine in hopes to get the information out in the world about the human rights crisis surrounding issues Men have to deal with, including False Rape Culture, Male Genital Mutilation, Forced Envelopment (males forced to penetrate), Family Court Bias, and overall Empathy Gap.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617468132/zbohjfzuqbkbe39zfdq4.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We want to a take moment to state very clearly, this isn't an anti-woman magazine. Much like the Lovely Ladies calendar, this will feature the participation of women (as well Men) and it is our hope that it can help bridge the gender divide.</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to be able to produce at minimum two magazines that is packed full of information related to male struggles but includes book reviews, fiction, humor, and images of people who support this movement. It is our desire for this to be an exposé of Male Culture with ongoing publications each and every year. If this campaign reaches its initial goal, we will be able to produce two small magazines. However, if we reach our first stretch goal, issue #2 will be larger than issue #1.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617468406/rolas0loswzrnexzedeq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The importance of this project is to create, in essence, a time capsule. This magazine will reflect the world attitudes towards men, both of mainstream and those within the Movement. In the past we have done calendars, which was successful. However, the problem in doing the calendars is that they tend to keep value for the year they represent. A magazine has the benefit of being timeless, which gives reason for people to get issues when they're release and possibly order back issues for any they missed.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us get the first two issues released. It is our hope that there is interest in the magazine so that each issue released will pay for the next one that come after. This may only be a two issue release, but we hope that all of you will find great value in this project for men, that you want to buy later editions so we can give men a representation in a innovative way.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $500, which is enough to get issue #1 printed, buy envelopes, and to get postage to send everything out. It is our hope that in reaching this goal that over time we'll get enough to release a second issue and possibly more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Stretch goals</strong></p>
<p><strong>COMPLETED </strong>$750 - <u>Second magazine</u> - Issue #2 we want to make bigger and better than the first, with more articles, features, and models. This is the reason why we need more money to produce it as well as needing more to ship it.</p>
<p><strong>$1200</strong> - <u>Special Edition</u> - This will be a special version of the magazine that will feature issue #0, #1, and #2, together. This may also have additional content as well. If we reach this goal, this issue will be released in June of 2021.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>How Funds Will Be Used</strong></p>
<p>Starting off, our intended goal is to produce issue #1 and issue #2. As we learned from doing the calendars, there is a lot of overhead when it comes to production and shipping. If for any reason we do not get our intended goal, we will use whatever funds we get to do issue #1 and honor those who donated.</p>
<p>Because we're a smaller independent company, our magazines are more expensive compared to other larger companies that can give more content. We hope one day to be in a position to match them, but starting off, we need to charge more due to overhead and the potential to make more magazines beyond the initial two.</p>
<p>One of the key difference between us and many other magazines, is that we are not dependent on our advertisers. Advertisers are how magazines are able to make their issues affordable for the consumer, which means that if an advertiser wants to cut off funding for space in the magazine, the magazine will do what they can to keep the business, which can mean a sacrifice of integrity. Our magazine will make use of advertisers who will need to pay for space, but we won't be dependent on their contributions, so should an advertiser wish to pull out due to content we create, it is our goal that the content comes first.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal is to make this an ongoing project. Whether we do this once a quarter or once a month, we would love to have a magazine that truly represents men's issues and celebrates masculinity. With that, (eventually) we would want to hire a small staff to make producing a magazine easier.</p>

<p>The first magazine we'll release will be more of a demo of what our magazines will look like. This will be released in time for Fathers' Day &amp; Fourth of July. This will include an article of the <strong>reunion of a father and son</strong>, a brief on <strong>construction safety</strong>, a <strong>centerfold</strong> of co-creator Catherine (who will also be the <strong>cover model</strong>), a discussion of how the media focuses on <strong>single mothers for Fathers' Day</strong>, and lastly some <strong>gift ideas for Fathers' Day</strong>.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>We all know males in our lives, whether it is our children, fathers, uncles, brothers, husbands, nephews, or even friends. To really bring up issues males face in our world today, unfortunately, falls on deaf ears. There is more concern for what happens to females than it does to males. We firmly believe everyone deserves to be heard and we shouldn't lazily label a whole group because it is convenient, however, because so many take the easy way out, men are invisible.</p>
<p>The importance of this magazine is that we cannot compete in the gender arena as the Feminists can, who can sway the audience for simply being a woman. In the interest of men, we have to find unique ways to get the message out there. In the past, we did the Lovely Ladies calendars, to not only get issues known, but to show that so many women support this movement. Now we want to take this to the next level by producing a magazine that can give further insights into what men are dealing with.</p>

This is a magazine about Men. Unlike most other magazines, our focus will be on the needs of Men versus our need to make a profit or to appease advertisers. Our magazine is made by those of us who care.
This project is being headed up by Chris ""mad_cat"" Votey and Catherine McClain. Both have done work in the Men's Movement, including the Lovely Ladies of Men's Issues Calendar, which mad_cat co-created with Modern Medusa, and Catherine modeled for. They desire to do more for men which led to the creation of this magazine in hopes to get the information out in the world about the human rights crisis surrounding issues Men have to deal with, including False Rape Culture, Male Genital Mutilation, Forced Envelopment (males forced to penetrate), Family Court Bias, and overall Empathy Gap.

We want to a take moment to state very clearly, this isn't an anti-woman magazine. Much like the Lovely Ladies calendar, this will feature the participation of women (as well Men) and it is our hope that it can help bridge the gender divide.
The goal of this campaign is to be able to produce at minimum two magazines that is packed full of information related to male struggles but includes book reviews, fiction, humor, and images of people who support this movement. It is our desire for this to be an exposé of Male Culture with ongoing publications each and every year. If this campaign reaches its initial goal, we will be able to produce two small magazines. However, if we reach our first stretch goal, issue #2 will be larger than issue #1.

The importance of this project is to create, in essence, a time capsule. This magazine will reflect the world attitudes towards men, both of mainstream and those within the Movement. In the past we have done calendars, which was successful. However, the problem in doing the calendars is that they tend to keep value for the year they represent. A magazine has the benefit of being timeless, which gives reason for people to get issues when they're release and possibly order back issues for any they missed.
Your contribution will help us get the first two issues released. It is our hope that there is interest in the magazine so that each issue released will pay for the next one that come after. This may only be a two issue release, but we hope that all of you will find great value in this project for men, that you want to buy later editions so we can give men a representation in a innovative way.
 

What We Need & What You Get
We are seeking $500, which is enough to get issue #1 printed, buy envelopes, and to get postage to send everything out. It is our hope that in reaching this goal that over time we'll get enough to release a second issue and possibly more.
 
Stretch goals
COMPLETED $750 - Second magazine - Issue #2 we want to make bigger and better than the first, with more articles, features, and models. This is the reason why we need more money to produce it as well as needing more to ship it.

Many of these bills end up becoming the laws that govern our daily lives as U.S. citizens
Yet, many of us have little insight into what legislation is actually being proposed by Congress, the content and implications of that legislation and how our elected politicians are voting on our behalf to enact such legislation
Additionally, corporate lobbying efforts and outsized funding from wealthy political donors and special interest groups has increasingly drowned-out the voices of the vast majority of the American electorate when it comes to passing legislation
  CivX is an easy-to-use mobile app that offers an intuitive, interactive and fun way to discover legislation in Congress, become an informed citizen and make your voice heard  Through its platform, CivX aims to create a community where we can all become engaged and empowered citizens as well as de facto lobbyists for the causes and issues that impact our everyday lives  
CivX curates trending legislation related to pertinent issues in the news cycle and also showcases other unique, interesting and surprisingly bizarre bills that hit the Congressional docket
Curated legislation on CivX includes custom summaries and, in selected instances, original CivX video content that presents the key facts, positions and circumstances of each bill in an objective, non-partisan and entertaining manner
All legislation is presented in a card-like format with digestible, summary details presented on the front and more fulsome information presented on the back, including a feature that allows users to seamlessly access the full text docketed in Congress
Users have access to the full library of docketed legislation in Congress (organized across 100+ categories) with the ability to filter bills by category or utilize the search function to look up specific bills
Users can create a unique profile and set push notifications to track progress as the legislation moves through Congress - seamlessly stay informed
    CivX offers a unique, entertaining and engaging way to become an informed citizen!  
CivX cards are pushed to users in a carousel-like manner
Interface allows users to seamlessly swipe-right to Support or swipe-left to Oppose any particular piece of legislation
Users can keep track of all positions taken, reference legislation details and even alter positions if there has been a change of heart
   
CivX can be integrated with Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn accounts, allowing users to share bills on their social media news feeds
Feature is a powerful tool for users to seamlessly promote bills of interest across their social media networks to drive awareness for legislation related to social, economic, health and other pressing societal issues and causes
  Finally, a platform to make important legislation GO VIRAL!  
If you feel very strongly about a particular bill, CivX allows you to take a step further with its unique and innovative system for making political contributions
CivX has created a first-of-its-kind platform for users to signal what legislation they strongly support or oppose through actual monetary contributions
 

 

Unlike traditional political contributions, which are made directly to individual candidates, the goal of CivX Contributions is to reward lawmaking ACTION taken by elected members of Congress that aligns with YOUR personal views on issues
The beta version of CivX Contributions is anticipated to be launched in January 2021. Please visit our website for a detailed tutorial on how CivX Contributions will work (here)
Finally, a way to crowdfund legislation and the causes behind it!
  
As an extension of the app, the CivX website is intended to become a public destination for useful and insightful information related to federal legislation
We will be publishing CivX Stats, which include informative and digestible statistics related to legislation currently before Congress (view our beta version of CivX Stats here)
In the future, we intend to share summary-level information related to user activity on the CivX app (e.g., most-supported bills, most-opposed bills, most shared bills, bills with largest contribution pools, etc.)
In addition, users of the CivX app will be able to log into their accounts on the website to view more detailed information related to their own usage, engagement and relative activity within the CivX community
We envision continually releasing new features that complement the existing community and core functionality of the app
Such features could include expanded video content and legislation detail, politician “score cards” showing Congressional voting and committee activity compared against CivX community voting and featured politician view points on selected legislation
In the future, we envision expanding the platform to the state and municipal levels, further extending connectivity and civic discourse within the U.S.
  
Our founding team is comprised of six passionate professionals with diverse backgrounds and highly-complementary experience, spanning energy, finance, media/entertainment, marketing and tech
We are located across the country and share a deep recognition of the current disconnectedness and growing apathy present amongst the majority of the electorate
Our goal with CivX is to provide citizens with a fun, informative and non-partisan community that will serve to expand participation in civic discourse, provide transparency and give people a meaningful voice again
To learn more about the team, please visit the CivX team page on our website (here)
  
To date, the founding team has invested significant time and effort to successfully develop and launch an initial version of the app that includes curated content, custom videos, back-end data analytics, company website and social media presence
Funding to date, which has been modest, has been entirely self-financed by the founding team members. However, this is only the beginning and we still have more work to do in order to make our vision a reality
Our goal is to raise $50,000 through this Indiegogo campaign to accelerate the growth of the CivX platform
Funding will be used to cover costs associated with: development (e.g., app upgrades, new app features, website), content creation, generating brand awareness and general overhead costs (e.g., accounting, legal, web hosting)
We are seeking early adopters within the Indiegogo community to contribute towards our development and also become advocates for CivX

<p>Minnesota NORML lost our funding this summer which led me to lay off staff and cease being paid myself. With a family to provide for, I sought work elsewhere while continuing to work for MN NORML on a part-time basis where I focused exclusively on developing new revenue streams. I formed a partnership with an experienced professional political fundraiser to launch a political telefundraising operation, which began calling Minnesota NORML members a month ago seeking donations and volunteer commitments. We are very hopeful that this will lead to the financial stabilization of our cannabis legalization advocacy organization. During the first month, with a very small team on the phones, we raised a little money and more than $20,000 in donation pledges.

The inner cover is made of metal (galvanized steel), precoated with a long life antibacterial plastic film. This last generation film is particularly useful in the presence of environmental conditions that favor the proliferation of bacteria, fungi and algae, and helps maintaining hygiene in environments where regular cleaning cannot be guaranteed.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Cocoon is powered by two batteries:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">A traditional battery for power consuming equipment (internal lighting, air extraction fan, etc.)</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">A lithium polymer battery to power the digital services (process units, microcontrollers, sensors)</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Recharging will be provided by two systems:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">a photovoltaic panel located on the top</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">electrical outlet in the collection centers for mobile cocoons or connection to the mains for fixed cocoons (the latter option is not yet available in the prototype).</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Recharging is controlled by means of an appropriate electronic system.</p>
<h3>The Control System</h3>
<p><strong>The Local System</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">A well-protected central processing unit (CPU) controls the GPS tracking functions, monitoring of environmental parameters, a vital functions monitor, and active requests for help.<br/>The CPU can perform logical operations to evaluate risk situations connected to critical combinations of values supplied by sensors installed in the Cocoon.<br/>The following sensors are currently provided:</p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">GPS</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Indoor and outdoor temperature</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">CO2</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Smoke</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Overthrow (tilt)</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Acceleration</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">A further development can be to equip the homeless with wearable sensors: the system will check the vital parameters of the occupant (mainly pulse rate and body temperature monitor) and, in critical situations, will automatically call for help via 4G.</p>
<p><strong>Remote Control Center</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The signals generated by the various cocoons get to an operating control center manned by staff / volunteers, who are able to control the position of all the ""Cocoon"" units through a ""google map"" tracking.<br/>The central logic system will trigger a ""health alert"" or ""security alarm” call on the basis of the data provided by one or more sensors according to predefined rules.<br/>When the position, the name of the occupant and the critical parameters detected by the sensors are known, it will be possible to alert the health assistance or the security services.</p>

<h3>The Social Project to make the homeless feel better!</h3>
</div></div>","The Social Project to help homeless feel better!Cocoon - How did the idea of this Social Project
 
That's why !
The homeless are people always at risk of exposure to environmental factors, especially during the winter when cold temperatures and bad weather hit harder.

In cities sprouting cardboard boxes, mattresses and other makeshift shelters often ineffective.

The entire community becomes guilty of those silent disappearances of homeless gathered in the morning why not have made it through the night.

Cocoon stems from the desire of a group of friends to tackle the emergency that homeless people are forced to face in the cold winter months.
Cocoon is a solution designed to provide dedicated shelter to protect the homeless from bad weather and cold. 
HOMELESSNESS IS A SOCIAL CONDITION
 ""If you think it can't happen to you, think again” 
 
Cocoon - How does this Social Project



 
Here's the  solution
COCOON is the evolution of a market cart designed to move easily in urban environments. COCOON is not a simple cart but a real survival shell. Thanks to the technology, the homeless  will be sheltered from frost and bad weather, safe in case of illness and protected in case of aggression due to social intolerance.

Every year the number of homeless people found dead due to the exposure to weather agents is impressive, the count of those who suffer from temporary impairment, permanent and sometimes fatal health status is even higher; those who survive, however, will suffer for a cruel personal situation. with high costs for the public health services,

Cocoon is the revolutionary concept of a push vehicle for homeless people who cannot find place in public shelters (often overcrowded) from the risk of freezing and/or contracting diseases, especially in the cold nights.
This survival shell can be either mounted on a cart for individual use or on fixed supports.

Thanks to the technological protection of the shell, the occupant will be safe in case of illness and secure in case of offense due to social intolerance. Each unit contains a “black box” with GPS, call buttons and status sensors, sensitive to risk conditions, in continuous 3G connection with a central station which can activate the local police for immediate help.
Concept & Facilities
Cocoon is different from any tent, caravan, container or any other shelter existing on the market not only for its highly technological materials but also for the next generation digital technologies used.The prototype is designed to be thermally and electrically self-contained, to eliminate to need for connection to electric outlets and heating systems. All these features make the Cocoon a reliable tool that can be safely handled by the homeless for a long time, overcoming a cause of mental illness: the lack of a safe shelter.

Our Timeline & Goals


 


 Technical Specifications
Structure

While designing the frame we had to consider contrasting requirements, such as the size of the cart vs. different sizes of people, weight vs. mobility in urban areas and resistance, difficult access vs. old age and/or health problems of the occupants, thermal and acoustic insulation vs. construction costs.
The Frame - The Fixed & The Mobile Part
The shape has been intentionally kept flat and square because:

It makes the construction process easier;
It reduces the need for dedicated production lines and molds; 
It makes possible to use materials which are commonly available on the market in flat sheets

with a significant reduction in materials and production costs.
For the prototype it was selected a tubular square iron profile with 5 mm (0,98”) and 20 mm (0,79”) cross sections. The weight is considered acceptable.If, however, the use of the final prototype should require a significant reduction of weight, the frame will be produced in aluminum, with a consequent increase in costs of materials and processes.        Two views of the fixed part structure and the frame in its maximum extension:

The habitability is achieved by means of a telescopic structure that extends on the front of the fixed part, designed for a man height up to 190 cm (6’3”) in the lying position. Taller people can also get in but cannotextend their legs completely. The structure of a normal cocoon will safely support up to 264 lb people.
The Cart & The Fixed Support
Cocoon is a survival cell which has been developed to meet the needs of most metropolitan areas. It is the evolution of a market cart, designed to move easily in urban environments: 
pneumatic wheels sized to overcome curbs and sidewalks, manual dynamic brake and parking brake.             
The option of a static support has been subsequently introduced following the suggestion of a major municipality to quickly create a ""low-cost village"" meant to accommodate masses of refugees. In comparison to other emergency solutions, the cost of cocoons is very competitive (eg. container homes). We have therefore designed quick standard couplings which can adapt to the supports of different environments such as continental climates, northern climates, rural areas, hilly lands, wetlands.
The Passenger Cell
It is the warm shelter of the system. Both fixed and extensible parts have been designed with a multi-layer coating to guarantee maximum comfort and protection.

The goal is to maintain internal temperatures by limiting the dispersion of the occupant's body heat while maintaining a thermal balance between the heat produced by the metabolic processes and the heat transferred to the outside, principally through the aeration of the Cocoon (convection / exchange), but also through conduction and radiation. The materials used are readily available:

Low-Density Polystyrene (Charged with Graphite for colder areas)

Plywood
Kraft Paper
Foam with Closed Cells

Pet film coated with a metallic reflecting agent, making it metallized polyethylene terephthalate (MPET), usually gold or silver in color, which reflects up to 97% of radiated heat (the same material used for emergency blankets).
Here a side is a prototype of the insulating layer.

The support with antibacterial plastic film has been tested and certified. It has also been certified as non-flammable.
The Interior
Its function is to provide occupant’s comfort. The cocoon has an internal dense PVC slatted base, which is also treated with antibacterial paint. The base will bend to allow the opening and closing of the cocoon at the swivel points and compensates the inner 2 layers created by the telescopic opening mechanism. The comfort is ensured by a roll-up mat.
 The Air Exchange System
The Cocoon’s ventilation is ensured by an air exchange grid. Fresh air passes through a passive heat exchanger for preheating; the heat is transferred from the exhaust air. A micro fan activated by a sensor helps air flow when convection is insufficient.
In the image, an aluminum film in the heat exchanger separates the outgoing warm exhausted air flow and the entering fresh air. The undulation and roughness of the material help respectively to increase the exchange surface and to create swirling flows, thus slowing down and mixing individual air masses.
The Energy
The Cocoon is powered by two batteries:

A traditional battery for power consuming equipment (internal lighting, air extraction fan, etc.)
A lithium polymer battery to power the digital services (process units, microcontrollers, sensors)

Recharging will be provided by two systems:

a photovoltaic panel located on the top
electrical outlet in the collection centers for mobile cocoons or connection to the mains for fixed cocoons (the latter option is not yet available in the prototype).

Recharging is controlled by means of an appropriate electronic system.
The Control System
The Local System
A well-protected central processing unit (CPU) controls the GPS tracking functions, monitoring of environmental parameters, a vital functions monitor, and active requests for help.The CPU can perform logical operations to evaluate risk situations connected to critical combinations of values supplied by sensors installed in the Cocoon.The following sensors are currently provided:

GPS
Indoor and outdoor temperature
CO2
Smoke
Overthrow (tilt)
Acceleration

A further development can be to equip the homeless with wearable sensors: the system will check the vital parameters of the occupant (mainly pulse rate and body temperature monitor) and, in critical situations, will automatically call for help via 4G.
Remote Control Center
The signals generated by the various cocoons get to an operating control center manned by staff / volunteers, who are able to control the position of all the ""Cocoon"" units through a ""google map"" tracking.The central logic system will trigger a ""health alert"" or ""security alarm” call on the basis of the data provided by one or more sensors according to predefined rules.When the position, the name of the occupant and the critical parameters detected by the sensors are known, it will be possible to alert the health assistance or the security services.

Moreover, we believe that it's based exclusively on the ideological opposition to the ideas of FALIŠ and its goal is a gradual diminishing of the programme's quality till its abolition.The only way for Festival in order to continue its work is to turn to its friends, supporters and to those who share its opinions. We address all those who believe  that there is an alternative to the predatory capitalism and that the better world is possible in spite of all the opposition of establishment backed up by major financial management.</i></p><p><i>The Festival of Alternative and Leftism in Šibenik is the only politically distinctive and by its very name, a clearly ideologically set festival among very few similar in Southeastern Europe.</i></p><p><i>FALIŠ lasts from the first Wednesday till the first Saturday in September  and it's being held in the open public spaces. The programmes are free for all the visitors and interaction with the audience is highly encouraged.</i></p><p><i>FALIŠ is the only conspicuous Leftist event that insists on the dialogue between the modern Leftism and the Church, more precisely, the Churches in Croatia and its surrounding areas, as well as on dialogue among the religious communities.</i></p><p><i>FALIŠ is the only place where a clear distinction between antifascism and the resistance movement in former Yugoslavia is persistently accentuated, as well as a clear critique of the authoritarian regime established after the WWII.</i></p><p><i>FALIŠ hosted Catalan Sister Teresa Forcades and her very first lecture in Southeastern Europe.</i></p><p><i>At FALIŠ, the first public debate between the Catholic Franciscan Drago Bojić and the Ortodox  Father Nikodim Kosović was held.</i></p><p><i>At FALIŠ, few months before the German premiere itself, Tariq Ali talked about his reading of Don Quixote and Cervantes on which contemporary dramatic text staged in Germany was based.</i></p><p><i>At FALIŠ, for the very first time the Croatian philosopher Boris Buden held his lecture under the title ""Do you speak European?"".</i></p><p><i>At FALIŠ we hosted the only presentation of Paul Mason's book in former Yugoslavia, ""Postcapitalism: guide to our future"" and the lecture of the same title held by the author himself.</i></p><p><i>At FALIŠ, Ms Renata Avila, one of the Wikileaks lawyers, talked about the Julian Assange's case and the Internet surveillance for the first time in Croatia.</i></p><p><i>At FALIŠ, the unique  collection of the images and pictures of the Beat Generation artists       (Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti, Burroughs, Bukovski..) was presented. It was a certain follow up of their activistic, antimilitant, libertarian orientation  as well as their inclination for sexual emancipation and exchange of ideas.</i></p><p><i>The minimal number of visitors of some FALIŠ programmes is about 300 people which is approximately one percent of Šibenik's population while certain programmes are held in Split, Zadar, Knin, Zagreb and even Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Slovenia.</i></p><p><i>FALIŠ is the event about which all the relevant media on the territory of the former Yugoslavia have thoroughly reported. For instance, the visit of Sister Teresa Forcades, the Leftist nun from Catalonia was followed by over 30 Internet portals and newspapers and her interview was broadcasted at the prime time on the national TV programme ( the HRT).</i></p><p><i>In the first four years of its existence nearly 50 programmes were held;  besides different lectures, debates, interviews, retrospectives and  film premieres (""Yes Man are indignant"" and ""Fascism ltd"" ), 20 books of Croatian and foreign writers were presented at FALIŠ, three concerts were held as well as four performances and three installations dedicated to the destruction of the industry in Croatia and the antifascism and its position in the contemporary society. In addition, the Croatian premiere of the theatre production “Democracy“ by Zijah Sokolović was held at Fališ.    </i></p><p><i>FALIŠ manages to put in use the terms like leftism and socialism as well as their symbols again in a way which implies the acceptance of different political opinions as legitimate ones, while the questioning of the basic civilizational values like the antifascism is rejected because that line of discussion is in itself essentially anticivilizational.</i></p><p><i>Maybe the ideal society doesn't exist but we think that every free society, socially well balanced, peaceful and tolerant, is worth trying. Our goal is to promote those values through all the segments of the Festival from lectures to all kinds of cultural programmes.</i></p><p><i>We consider equally important our dedication to the promotion of the rights of minorities and LGBT persons' rights as well as insisting on the sexual and social equality in the public life of any society.</i></p><p><i>Considering the Festival an idea and not only a public event, the participants remain connected to the Festival in various ways, as later editors, programme directors, counselors etc. Some of them are: director Angela Richter (Germany), theologian and nun Teresa Forcades (Spain), philosopher Boris Buden (Croatia/Germany), writer and activist Tariq Ali (Great Britain), film director Aris Chatzistefanou (Greece), writer Andrej Nikolaidis (Montenegro), journalist and diplomat Zlatko Dizdarević (Bosnia and Herzegovina), activist and former professional football player Ivan Ergić (Serbia)...</i></p><p><i>The FALIŠ association is funded exclusively by donations the spending of which is transparent and management reports are publicly available.</i></p><p><i>If you feel that such a festival deserves your support and if you believe that its existence helps the spreading of better, more just, socially balanced society, your donations to FALIŠ can be sent directly to our Association bank account, via money order or by Internet banking.

Zbrojimo li i odbijenih 10.000, četiri FALIŠ-a, a prema procjeni Ministarstva, vrijede ukupno 75.000 kuna.Za samo jedan, peti, prijatelji festivala iz Hrvatske, Sjedinjenih Država, Njemačke, Srbije, Malezije, Španjolske, Italije, Nizozemske, Švicarske, Slovenije, Norveške, Austrije, Francuske, Češke, Danske, Bosne i Hercegovine, Mađarske, Belgije, Crne Gore i Švedske, donirali su 78.000 kuna u novcu, ali i ponudili pomoć u različitim uslugama neophodnim za organiziranje FALIŠ-a!Svima njima, ali i prijateljskim medijima koji su pomogli oglašavanju naše kampanje, možemo, prije svega, reći iskreno i veliko FALA, te obećati bogat programski sadržaj na Maloj loži u Šibeniku, od 6. do 9. rujna, gdje će središnja festivalska tema biti „100 godina Oktobarske revolucije“.Također, svi koji žele nastaviti pomagati FALIŠ, mogu to i dalje činiti uplatama na žiro račun:Udruga FALIŠ, Nikole Tesle 1, 22000 Šibenik, IBAN:  HR3324110061120009120 / SWIFT: JADRHR2X; Jadranska banka dd Šibenik; Ante Starčevića 4 22000 Šibenik; Opis plaćanja: Donacija za neprofitnu udrugu Fališ; Poziv na broj primatelja: HR02  2017.Fala!Organizatori Festivala alternative i ljevice Šibenik                                                                NEMOJ DA FALIŠNakon četiri godine postojanja Festivala alternative i ljevice Šibenik (FALIŠ), Ministarstvo kulture Republike Hrvatske odlučilo mu je znatno smanjiti financijsku potporu, čime je ugroženo održavanje petog FALIŠ-a, čija je središnja tema ""100 godina Oktobarske revolucije"", a podtema ""500 godina reformacije Crkve"".Umanjenu potporu Ministarstva odlučili smo odbiti, jer smatramo da se temelji isključivo na ideološkom protivljenju idejama FALIŠ-a te da za cilj ima postupno rušenje kvalitete programa i minoriziranje do ukinuća Festivala. Jedini način da FALIŠ nastavi postojati je da zamoli donacije prijatelja, istomišljenika i svih koji vjeruju da alternativa predatorskom kapitalizmu postoji te da je bolji svijet ipak moguć, ma koliko mu se protivio establišment podržan krupnim kapitalom.Festival alternative i ljevice Šibenik (FALIŠ) politički je profiliran i jasno, imenom, ideološki određen Festival, kakvih je malo u jugoistočnoj Europi.FALIŠ traje od prve srijede do subote, u rujnu, održava se na javnom prostoru gradskog foruma, svi programi su besplatni i potiču komunikaciju s publikom.FALIŠ je jedini lijevo profilirani događaj koji potencira dijalog suvremene ljevice i religijskih zajednica, točnije crkava u, prije svega, Hrvatskoj, ali i na širem području, kao i dijalog među njihovim predstavnicima.FALIŠ je mjesto na kojem se pravi jasna razlika između antifašizma i pokreta otpora u bivšoj Jugoslaviji te autoritarnog režima uspostavljenog nakon Drugog svjetskog rata.Na FALIŠ-u je, prvi put u jugoistočnoj Europi, predavanje održala časna sestra Teresa Forcades.Na FALIŠ-u je, prvi put u Hrvatskoj, u javnom prostoru održana debata između katoličkog i pravoslavnog svećenika – fra Drage Bojića i oca Nikodima Kosovića.Na FALIŠ-u je, nekoliko mjeseci prije premijere predstave u Njemačkoj, Tariq Ali govorio o svom čitanju Don Quijotea i Cervantesa, na čemu se temeljio dramski tekst postavljen u Njemačkoj.Prvo predavanje na otvorenom prostoru FALIŠ-a održao je filozof Boris Buden, i to na temu „Govorite li europski?“.Jedino predstavljanje knjige „Postkapitalizam: vodič za našu budućnost“ u bivšoj Jugoslaviji i predavanje o toj temi Paul Mason održao je na FALIŠ-u.Na FALIŠ-u je o slučaju Juliana Assangea i nadzoru interneta prvi put u Hrvatskoj govorila članica odvjetničkog tima WikiLeaksa Renata Avila.FALIŠ je pokazao jedinstvenu kolekciju slika i crteža beatnika (Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti, Burroughs, Bukovski…) te se time nastavio na njihovu aktivističku, antimilitantnu, slobodarsku, seksualno emancipatornu i idejnim razmjenama sklonu orijentaciju.Minimalan broj posjetitelja pojedinih programa FALIŠ-a je oko 300 ljudi, što je oko 1 % stanovnika Šibenika, a neke programe prati publika iz Splita, Zadra, Knina, Zagreba, ali i BiH, Srbije, Slovenije...FALIŠ je događaj o kojem su izvještavali svi relevantni mediji na prostoru bivše Jugoslavije pa je tako gostovanje Terese Forcades, časne sestre ljevičarke iz Katalonije, popratilo više od 30 portala i novina, a intervju s njom emitiran je u prime-timeu hrvatske javne televizije (HRT).Tijekom četiri godine Festivala održano je oko 50 različitih programa: osim predavanja, debata, javnih intervjua, retrospektiva i premijernih prikazivanja filmova – „Yes Man su revoltirani“ i „Fašizam d.o.o.“ – na FALIŠ-u je predstavljeno 20-ak knjiga domaćih i stranih autora, održana su tri koncerta, producirana četiri performancea i instalacija posvećena deindustrijalizaciji Hrvatske, ali i antifašizmu i njegovu položaju u suvremenom društvu. Na FALIŠ-u je održana i hrvatska premijera kazališne predstave „Demokracija“ Zijaha A. Sokolovića.FALIŠ termine poput ljevice i socijalizma, kao i njihove simbole, vraća u javnu upotrebu tako što podrazumijeva prihvaćanje različitih političkih mišljenja kao legitimnih, dok propitivanje temeljnih vrijednosti poput antifašizma odbacuje, jer takav revizionizam smatra anticivilizacijskim činom.Možda idealno društvo ne postoji, ali smatramo da je svako slobodno, socijalno uravnoteženo, mirno i tolerantno vrijedno napora. Cilj nam je te vrijednosti promovirati kroz sve festivalske segmente, od predavanja do kulturnih programa.Jednako važnim smatramo zalaganje za borbu i promociju manjinskih prava i prava LGBT-osoba, inzistiranje na rodnoj i socijalnoj ravnopravnosti u javnom životu.Smatrajući FALIŠ idejom, a ne samo javnim događajem, sudionici programa ostaju vezani uz Festival na različite načine, kao kasniji urednici, voditelji programa, savjetnici... Neki od njih su: redateljica Angela Richter (Njemačka), teologinja i časna sestra Teresa Forcades (Španjolska), filozof Boris Buden (Hrvatska/Njemačka), pisac i aktivist Tariq Ali (Velika Britanija), redatelj Aris Chatzistefanou (Grčka), pisac Andrej Nikolaidis (Crna Gora), novinar i diplomat Zlatko Dizdarević (BiH), aktivist i bivši profesionalni nogometaš Ivan Ergić (Srbija)...Udruga FALIŠ financira se isključivo donacijama čije je trošenje transparentno, a izvješća o poslovanju Udruge javno su dostupna.Ako smatrate da ovakav festival vrijedi Vaše podrške i vjerujete da njegovo postojanje pomaže širenju ideja boljeg, pravednijeg, socijalno uravnoteženog, slobodnog društva, podržite ga putem ove stranice ili izravno, uplatom na žiro-račun naše udruge, putem opće uplatnice ili internetskog bankarstva. Podaci su dostupni OVDJE. Mi ćemo Vam se zahvaliti službeno, materijalno i programski, nadajući se i Vašem dolasku na FALIŠ. Na još jedno mjesto za još jednu borbu.Hvala.I, nemoj da fališ!                                                              Don't FAIL!When the Croatian Ministry of Culture decided to cut significantly the financial support for FALIŠ, the Festival of Alternative and Leftism in Šibenik, after only four years of its existence, it compromised its fifth edition whose main theme is dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the October revolution along with 500 years of the Church Reformation as an additional topic.We decided to reject  the decreased financial support of the Ministry as it doesn't allow us to cover at least partially the boarding expenses of the Festival's participants. Moreover, we believe that it's based exclusively on the ideological opposition to the ideas of FALIŠ and its goal is a gradual diminishing of the programme's quality till its abolition.The only way for Festival in order to continue its work is to turn to its friends, supporters and to those who share its opinions. We address all those who believe  that there is an alternative to the predatory capitalism and that the better world is possible in spite of all the opposition of establishment backed up by major financial management.The Festival of Alternative and Leftism in Šibenik is the only politically distinctive and by its very name, a clearly ideologically set festival among very few similar in Southeastern Europe.FALIŠ lasts from the first Wednesday till the first Saturday in September  and it's being held in the open public spaces. The programmes are free for all the visitors and interaction with the audience is highly encouraged.FALIŠ is the only conspicuous Leftist event that insists on the dialogue between the modern Leftism and the Church, more precisely, the Churches in Croatia and its surrounding areas, as well as on dialogue among the religious communities.FALIŠ is the only place where a clear distinction between antifascism and the resistance movement in former Yugoslavia is persistently accentuated, as well as a clear critique of the authoritarian regime established after the WWII.FALIŠ hosted Catalan Sister Teresa Forcades and her very first lecture in Southeastern Europe.At FALIŠ, the first public debate between the Catholic Franciscan Drago Bojić and the Ortodox  Father Nikodim Kosović was held.At FALIŠ, few months before the German premiere itself, Tariq Ali talked about his reading of Don Quixote and Cervantes on which contemporary dramatic text staged in Germany was based.At FALIŠ, for the very first time the Croatian philosopher Boris Buden held his lecture under the title ""Do you speak European?"".At FALIŠ we hosted the only presentation of Paul Mason's book in former Yugoslavia, ""Postcapitalism: guide to our future"" and the lecture of the same title held by the author himself.At FALIŠ, Ms Renata Avila, one of the Wikileaks lawyers, talked about the Julian Assange's case and the Internet surveillance for the first time in Croatia.At FALIŠ, the unique  collection of the images and pictures of the Beat Generation artists       (Ginsberg, Ferlinghetti, Burroughs, Bukovski..) was presented. It was a certain follow up of their activistic, antimilitant, libertarian orientation  as well as their inclination for sexual emancipation and exchange of ideas.The minimal number of visitors of some FALIŠ programmes is about 300 people which is approximately one percent of Šibenik's population while certain programmes are held in Split, Zadar, Knin, Zagreb and even Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Slovenia.FALIŠ is the event about which all the relevant media on the territory of the former Yugoslavia have thoroughly reported. For instance, the visit of Sister Teresa Forcades, the Leftist nun from Catalonia was followed by over 30 Internet portals and newspapers and her interview was broadcasted at the prime time on the national TV programme ( the HRT).In the first four years of its existence nearly 50 programmes were held;  besides different lectures, debates, interviews, retrospectives and  film premieres (""Yes Man are indignant"" and ""Fascism ltd"" ), 20 books of Croatian and foreign writers were presented at FALIŠ, three concerts were held as well as four performances and three installations dedicated to the destruction of the industry in Croatia and the antifascism and its position in the contemporary society. In addition, the Croatian premiere of the theatre production “Democracy“ by Zijah Sokolović was held at Fališ.    FALIŠ manages to put in use the terms like leftism and socialism as well as their symbols again in a way which implies the acceptance of different political opinions as legitimate ones, while the questioning of the basic civilizational values like the antifascism is rejected because that line of discussion is in itself essentially anticivilizational.Maybe the ideal society doesn't exist but we think that every free society, socially well balanced, peaceful and tolerant, is worth trying. Our goal is to promote those values through all the segments of the Festival from lectures to all kinds of cultural programmes.We consider equally important our dedication to the promotion of the rights of minorities and LGBT persons' rights as well as insisting on the sexual and social equality in the public life of any society.Considering the Festival an idea and not only a public event, the participants remain connected to the Festival in various ways, as later editors, programme directors, counselors etc. Some of them are: director Angela Richter (Germany), theologian and nun Teresa Forcades (Spain), philosopher Boris Buden (Croatia/Germany), writer and activist Tariq Ali (Great Britain), film director Aris Chatzistefanou (Greece), writer Andrej Nikolaidis (Montenegro), journalist and diplomat Zlatko Dizdarević (Bosnia and Herzegovina), activist and former professional football player Ivan Ergić (Serbia)...The FALIŠ association is funded exclusively by donations the spending of which is transparent and management reports are publicly available.If you feel that such a festival deserves your support and if you believe that its existence helps the spreading of better, more just, socially balanced society, your donations to FALIŠ can be sent directly to our Association bank account, via money order or by Internet banking.

<p>The city of Akron and all people in authority hate our tents.</p>
<p>They tell us they are not fit for human habitation. They tell us they don't fit into the neighborhood. They tell us that these people shouldn't be living in tents.</p>
<p>I have always agreed with that. American citizens whose families have lived here for generations should definitely NOT be living in tents.</p>

85 Kent Place, Akron Ohio
It may not look like much at the moment. But symbolically it is a HUGE milestone for us.
I have learned so much in the last couple years working with these incredible people who happen to be homeless at the moment. I've worked with them through an incredibly cold winter when they were staying in tents that looked like this:

Winter of 2017 - 2018, Akron Ohio
We currently have about 45 people living in our tent city.
The city of Akron and all people in authority hate our tents.
They tell us they are not fit for human habitation. They tell us they don't fit into the neighborhood. They tell us that these people shouldn't be living in tents.
I have always agreed with that. American citizens whose families have lived here for generations should definitely NOT be living in tents.
But the reality of the situation is that they are.
Over these last two years I have seen first hand unbelievable living conditions. 
Families living in drug houses because they can't afford to go anywhere else.
Men and women living on porches of abandoned and nearly falling down houses.
Countless people that live outdoors with not so much as a tarp to keep the rain off of them.
The underbelly of America is dark, sad and tragic.
On top of that, living on the streets and in the woods is highly dangerous. 
You are all but guaranteed to get all your possessions stolen the first couple nights you spend on the street. New homeless people are easy marks for thieves and predators.
Young men and women are often raped and prostituted.
Everyone I've ever met who has spent time on the street has at least been physically threatened and very often beat up... just because.
So yes, I hate that Americans are living in tents. But our tent city is WORLDS better than living on the street.
We have security and security cameras. We have laundry and showers. We have computers. We have clothing. We have food. 
We have everything you need to get stable so you can work on your mental health, your addictions and getting into housing.
But I can also tell you that getting into housing is an endless maze of paperwork, meetings, emailing and calling.
Housing providers will tell me that the homeless need to ""want"" a house. By that they mean they have to jump through countless hoops and wait for who knows how long.
The Akron Metropolitan Housing Authority has a 3 year waiting list with 20,000 people on that list.
What are you supposed to do for 3 years?
Today is a huge opportunity for us. WE BOUGHT OUR VERY FIRST HOUSE!
This house is directly behind our day center and tent city. So the residents of our house will be able to easily have access to our facility.
We also have maintenance and repairs to do to the house.  This is where YOU come in. 
We really, truly need your help with this home.
Your help will allow us to own this house outright. And it will also let us make the repairs that are needed to the house.
It is in desperate need of a paint job.
It needs screens for the windows.
It needs walls to be put up.
But all the bones of the house are good. The roof is good. The basement is dry. The furnace works. All the utilities work. 
By partnering with private citizens like you we don't have all the constraints of the federal government. That way we are able to quickly and efficiently move people into our house.
The key to breaking down the barriers of housing the homeless of America is YOU.
We truly need you.
