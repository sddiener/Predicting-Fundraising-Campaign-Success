<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Lore:</b></p>
<p>Settled in a world of war the Heroes of exorath will define glory and victory to there allies and enemies. The god Exorath, friend of all 4 races, once created an island so big that it could contain all the races. But peace didn't last. It only took a few misunderstandings once the races wanted to expand their land rule over the other races. But Exorath knew this was going to happen, and he already planned on how to minimize the damage of this war: He broke 4 parts of the main island creating places for the races to live on! Now the races live in peace on their own islands but the war continues in the chaotic main island.</p>
<p><b>Races,Classes and Skills: </b></p>
<p>There will be 4 main races with each a bonus in something: Elves(movement speed),Orcs(attack damage), Humans (health) and Dwarves (Skill speed).<br/>When the heroes chose a race they get the option to become an archer, a warrior or a mage (more classes will be coming). These classes all have their own abilities (about 9 each) and their own bonusses! So that means your players basic stats will be based on your race and your class.</p>
<p><b>Leveling: </b></p>
<p>Like in any mmorpg Leveling is a main aspect of the game, it will become progressively harder and but will give big rewards: You can spend skill points that you get from leveling in the skilltree to unlock new skills or upgrade old ones, This will allow peaple to make their own builds! By leveling up your stats also increase:your plain health, base attack damage... Levels are also required to equip certain gear, enter certain dungeons and do certain quests</p>
<p><b>Dynamic events: </b> </p>
<p>We will implement dynamic events into quests,dungeons and boss fights. What this means is that it wont be just running from a to b, killing these mobs, fighting that mob... No, In dungeons walls can collapse or mobs can dig into the dungeon, there will be quests where you have to light certain outposts to notice the ally's that enemies are on there way!<br/>Dynamic events will be a really complicated system but we will open a forum for suggestions etc.</p>
<p><b>Transportation:</b> </p>
<p>Our members will be able to transport trough islands and other stuff by using our orc helicopters, balloons and ships! There will also be scroll teleportation (these scrolls will teleport you to towns and randomly drop by mobs</p>
<p><b>Mobs: </b></p>
<p>There will be 4 Types of mobs: Normals, Champions, Uniques and bosses:<br/>Normals: These mobs are the most common and are rather easy to kill. They dont have special attacks and have low chanse of dropping good gear.</p>
<p>Champions: We want champions to spawn in small groups and be harder to kill then normals, they also deal more damage. The drop chanses are alot higher to get unique and magic drops.</p>
<p>Uniques: These mobs will spawn solo that means no other mobs around and they are sort of small bosses. They are really strong but rewards are high. Can you sustain their strong and unique sets of abilities?</p>
<p>Bosses: The bosses will spawn in a boss chamber in dungeons or quest arenas. These arenas will include dynamic events like The boss destroying stuff in it, blocking the entrance and deploying certain aoe blocks where if you walk close they explode or slow you down.</p>
<p><b>Items:</b></p>
<p>The items will be split up in 5 categories: Common, Unique, Magic, Rare and Legendary.<br/>These categories represent how much identify buffs they will get(identifying will cost the player some money and time to do, we are not sure how we are gonna do this to make it the most enjoyable for the players so make sure to tell us what you would want out of this).<br/><br/>All of our items will have random stats but are limited to a max and min stat, for example: Sword of the fallen knight will drop by mobs of lvl7 and has 10-25dmg</p>
<p><b>Why you should support the server:</b></p>
<p>We really need the money for our servers so they can be dedicated and have the best stats possible, we also need money to hire art designers, coders, and website developers! We here at Heroes Of Exorath would really appreciate it if you would give a pound or two to our project. Every bit counts!</p>
<p><b>Alpha and Beta access:</b></p>
<p>As soon as we have something that is worth showing we will setup a server for the members who have the alpha reward. Our closed beta will only be going live in 1-2 months. I hope you will enjoy them!</p>
<p><b>You can also help us with:</b> </p>
<p>-Helping us code plugins<br/>-Helping us build the world<br/>-Helping us host the server<br/>-Helping with the site development</p>

</div><h3><span>Welcome to DruCon 2016!</span></h3><p>Chances are if you're here, you've already heard about us. But just in case you haven't…</p><h3>Background</h3><p>Once upon a time, there was a St. Louis-based podcast called Fear the Boot. Along with putting out a consistently high-quality podcast, Fear the Boot fostered a massive online community. This community grew so large and varied that the hosts of Fear the Boot decided to throw an annual gaming convention, lovingly called Fear the Con. Fear the Con came back again and again, eight years in a row! And then the hosts of Fear the Boot decided to take a well deserved rest, and decided to postpone Fear the Con 9 for a year.</p><p>But the community that had grown up around Fear the Boot wanted more! Instead of demanding more from the hosts, however, several members of that community took it upon themselves to run their OWN convention, right around the same time as Fear the Con, but with its own flavor and personality. Thus, DruCon was born!</p><p>DruCon is really a labor of love. We decided we can't go a whole 730 days without seeing our Fear the Boot family, so we are putting this together so we don't have to!</p><h3>What We Plan to Do</h3><p>Didn’t you read the last section? We’re putting on a convention! We’ve named it DruCon in honor of the Drury Inn, our home away from home in Maryland Heights. True, the convention won’t be at that particular Drury Inn (see our Facebook page for more details), but the Drury we’ll be at is larger, with plenty of meeting rooms and no pesky drive at the end of the night. It’ll be two days of gaming, morning until evening, with the same folks you know and love from Fear the Cons past.</p><br/><p>Which folks? Well, there’s your erstwhile organizers, Adam (more Alpha than Chad), Bob (runs ScoobyThulhu), and Derek (Mr. Fear the Charity). There’s YOU, the community. Veteran artist and designer Ruben Smith-Zempel will be designing a poster and t-shirt for the event. And Fear the Con regular Mikey Mason will be there to BLOW OUR MINDS.</p><h3>What We Need and Why We Are Crowdfunding To Get It</h3><p>The fact of the matter is, using the meeting rooms at the Drury is not free. By the same token, we understand that the hotel is not free on YOUR end. So no matter how much we raise, the convention is happening, and we'll make up the difference, but we would rather not have to.</p><p>We ask that you donate only what you think you can reasonably afford. Do not break the bank, just put in what you can! If we get more than we need, we will put the overages right back into the convention! More money raised means stretch goals, more gaming room, saving for a gaming convention next year, etc.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><font size=""4""><b>The story so far...</b></font></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><font size=""3"">Hi! Weâ€™re Starchaser Studios, a small group of game making enthusiasts spread across both the EU and the US. For us, what started out as a a simple hobby has gradually evolved into a full grown passion.</font></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><font size=""3"">In a nutshell, after some early experiments, we decided that our dream of making professional games should come to life. <span style=""line-height: 115%;"">Although
we already had full time jobs, a </span>team consisting of a game designer, a programmer and a project manager gathered. In other words, back in June 2011, three friends decided to break the routine. They were soon joined by others, such as an enthusiastic financial manager, a 2D artist and a 3D modeler.</font></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><font size=""3"">Although the core development team has been constant for the past few months, we also have a fair number of collaborators who contribute depending on their spare time, commitment and skills. Because of our community driven nature, we believe that itâ€™s mainly the community that should benefit from games developed this way. Therefore, our first release will be completely FREE for everyone: no paid features, no commercials, just clean, simple fun.</font></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><font size=""3""><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.starchaserstudios.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Starchaser_White_Small.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></font></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><font size=""3"">However, this new passion has been taking a lot of our time and funds. While we did manage to acquire some of the needed software and pay a part of our collaborators, we still need to acquire a couple of more licenses and additional materials. But...weâ€™ll talk about that later. For the moment, allow us to present our first creation.</font></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 12pt;""><font size=""4""><b>We've got Uplift!</b></font></p>

</div></div>","The story so far...
Hi! Weâ€™re Starchaser Studios, a small group of game making enthusiasts spread across both the EU and the US. For us, what started out as a a simple hobby has gradually evolved into a full grown passion.
In a nutshell, after some early experiments, we decided that our dream of making professional games should come to life. Although
we already had full time jobs, a team consisting of a game designer, a programmer and a project manager gathered. In other words, back in June 2011, three friends decided to break the routine. They were soon joined by others, such as an enthusiastic financial manager, a 2D artist and a 3D modeler.
Although the core development team has been constant for the past few months, we also have a fair number of collaborators who contribute depending on their spare time, commitment and skills. Because of our community driven nature, we believe that itâ€™s mainly the community that should benefit from games developed this way. Therefore, our first release will be completely FREE for everyone: no paid features, no commercials, just clean, simple fun.

However, this new passion has been taking a lot of our time and funds. While we did manage to acquire some of the needed software and pay a part of our collaborators, we still need to acquire a couple of more licenses and additional materials. But...weâ€™ll talk about that later. For the moment, allow us to present our first creation.
We've got Uplift!
For the moment, we're busy working on our first title. Uplift is a fantasy themed game for both iOS and Android, with a pinch of steampunk flavour. At its roots, Uplift is a combination between a platformer and a puzzle game, although weâ€™d like to believe the game created its own path.
The game follows the adventures of professor Flugen, renowned zeppelin specialist, his nephew Zack and his pet robot. Desperate to help their home city, one of the many floating cities of their world, the three embark on a quest to find the precious heltrogen gas. Obviously, this scarce resource does not grow on trees, but lays hidden deep within a savage mountain range. A small airship, a difficult task and dangers lurking around each corner. Guess who the main pilot is going to be?
You may notice our story is not the hardcore steampunk novel some might expect. Donâ€™t worry, our extensive Lore Book will more than make up for it. Based on hybrid mechanics, our game tries to find a balance between easy to understand controls and spontaneous challenges. No complicated schemes, no crippling bugs and no unfinished levels.
While the graphics and mechanics have evolved since our first video, so did the expectations. You may find more screenshots and information on our web-site: www.starchaserstudios.com

Our desired launch date would be the 1st quarter of 2012 (Q1 2012). The game will initially be launched on Android and soon after, depending on the raised funds, on the iOS. Other platforms will follow, if the game is successful. No matter what platform you will choose to play it on, the bottom line is that you will receive a FREE, quality title.
What will the money be used for?
As weâ€™ve said earlier, weâ€™ve already managed to get a small team to work together, so we wonâ€™t ask for any money to accomplish any programming or creative tasks. This is our job, and we will give our best to accomplish it. 
Weâ€™ve also paid our bills on web activities and the additional tools we use on the game. As a primary tool however, weâ€™re using the world famous Unity. This is why, we still need money for professional licenses which will not only help us finish our first game, but will also help us develop future titles:


When it comes to licenses, they donâ€™t make any special offers for dreamers. A Unity Pro along with an Android Pro license would be perfect in order to properly integrate some of the more advanced features weâ€™ve prepared for you. Most of custom shaders and custom features canâ€™t be truly appreciated in the current version of the game, since the free version of Unity will not render them properly. According to the Unity website, each of these items are priced at around $1500.
Obviously, the next logical step would be the iOS Pro package priced at $1500.


But letâ€™s not get carried away by numbers here. We donâ€™t really want to sound greedy, so weâ€™ll just wrap things up to a few basic thresholds:


$2900 for the basic licenses (we will support all additional taxes and the price difference)
$4400 to speed up the iOS release (wishful thinking, we know)


Honestly, weâ€™ll be more than happy if we manage to reach our first threshold, so just pitch in, if you feel like it. If you canâ€™t, donâ€™t worry. Youâ€™ll help by just spreading the word!
The rewards will be given in the second half of the campaign or at the end. The reason is we want the beta test keys to be a nice addition to your rewards, rather than a way of just previewing the product.

If you help us go beyond that, none of your donations will be wasted. Your money will be carefully invested in founding a dream and making sure the mobile game world will be richer by at least a quality title.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

This wargame is set in the same science fantasy setting as my novels.  It's currently a promotional website.By June 7, 2014, I want to implement:
A proper guest demo mode, to allow trying out the game without a proper account.  The first scenario in each of the three examples should be playable on or before June 7, 2014. 
Two of these scenarios are space combat; one is intantry combat.  The game is turn-based with planned moves.
A minimal ""base command management"" screen.
The non-playable factions need cameo pictures.  The site itself needs a proper HTML design.  Final-release artwork will not be attempted.

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Jordan Hart, I am the founder of PurpleHatch Games. PurpleHatch Games is an independent studio in North-West England. This is my first commercial game although I have worked on 2 games previously. I am a programmer and work in C#, C++ and Java.</p>
<h3>What is the Game About?</h3>
<p>Twist is a 3D platformer following the story of a nano-biological experiment named 'Twist'. The gameplay follows him infiltrating various organisations to steal intel wanted by the government. The story is a loose parody of pop culture spy films with lashigns of dry humour.</p>
<p>Where Twist is different is in its gameplay mechanics. The player has the ability to controls the player's rotation as well as jumping. This makes for an intriguing cross between Bit Trip Runner and Fez, both are games that I admire very much.</p>
<h3>When will it be Released?</h3>
<p>The game is slated for a release in late October. This will just be an Alpha release followed by several updated releases before the final build goes public. IndieGoGo contributors will gain access to every single one of those releases.</p>

<p>“Traders of Valhalla” is an adventure for brave Vikings daring to seek fortune in distant lands, but their treasure is in danger on the high seas. Each band of Vikings hails forth from Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and the Isles to trade for riches as far east as Kiev and west as the New World.</p>
<p>Using strategy and cunning, each Viking thang (lord) moves his band of Vikings from one emporium (trade city) to another emporium, collecting different sorts of wealth to complete trade sets. All of their movements are under the control of the Tools of the Norns, who can be fickle...</p>
<p><strong>Goal</strong></p>
<p>Each Viking Thang leads a band of Viking men via ship via four different trade routes to various famous medieval emporia (trade cities), collecting different sorts of wealth from the trade items of each city. Extra points are awarded for complete sets of all items, as well as sets of trade route good (I.e. the New World set has rich commodities such as fur, seals, ivory, timber, and victuals). When the last land is collected, the game ends and the Viking band with the most points wins.</p>
<p><strong>What is in the box?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1 Viking map game board</li>
<li>4 sets of 3 (12) Viking Thangs (lords)</li>
<li>Tools of the Norns (dice)</li>
<li>Replica Viking coin</li>
<li>12 silver Viking torcs</li>

<p><strong>Playing the Game</strong></p>
<p>The oldest player begins. He declares which nation his Viking band is from (chosen from Norway, the Isles, Denmark, or Sweden). Thereafter, the Vikings take turns in clockwise order. In the first round, the Viking players each place one of their men on the board as described below:</p>
<p>The first Viking player, having chosen Norway, takes the Tools of the Norns and feeds them to the dragonhead prow to see his fortune in movement: (the dice show 2 and 3). He selects one of his men, moves him through his own home port in Norway, Trondheim (the seat of the king's power), two spaces toward Bergen. As Norway, in history, his ally would have been the Isles so he chooses to have his second Viking man enter at the port of the Isle of Man, the King’s seat of the Isles, and move to Dublin, flip the token there and take a slave.</p>
<p>The second Viking player chooses the Isles and becomes his ally in history, though they can act as allies in game (if four players) or not act allies, the ports will remain open entry for start sequence (what happens during game play is up to players). Sweden and Denmark are allies: Sweden with a home port at Uppsala and Denmark at Jelling.</p>
<p>The game now continues and all following turns are played as follows: The Viking player feeds the Tools of the Norns to the dragonhead prow to devise his fortune in movement. He can then move 2 of his 3 men each turn, possibly taking trade goods, trading, or raiding as described below.</p>
<p><strong>TURNS</strong></p>
<p>Each Vikings turn consists of 2-4 phases.</p>
<p><strong>1. Movement</strong></p>
<p>The Viking takes the Tools of the Norns and feeds it through the dragonhead prow to devise his fortune in movement (he rolls 2 dice). He uses one tool to show him how much he is allotted to move one of his Viking band along the trade routes, and the other tool to move another man. If the man ends his movement in an emporium, the Viking may collect a trade good. The rules below govern movement.</p>
<p><strong>2. Obtaining Trade Goods</strong></p>
<p>Sailing the trade routes, the Viking players gather trade goods of common, rare, and exceptional value at far flung emporia.</p>
<p>Trade Goods: (Prime, Rare, Common)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478826328/c4jsw4iaoyocp1l1g9jx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;""><strong>Using Tokens</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:.25in;"">Tokens are all designed differently and many are used at different times of game play.

<p><strong>Trade or Raid</strong></p>
<p>This action will probably come up mid-game for trading and raiding towards the very end. (Advice!)

<p>The game ends immediately when a Viking player settles (takes) the last land unit.</p>
<p>A full set of all trade items is worth 25 points.

<p>Nous venons d'ajouter une nouvelle fonctionnalité au rangement en nid d'abeille : il est désormais possible de sortir les tokens un à un !</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FNyLFSIPTexQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DNyLFSIPTexQ&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FNyLFSIPTexQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>Devenez pionnier en participant au financement de la première génération de tokens en relief compatibles avec X Wing  ! <br/></p>
<p>S'appuyant sur la technologie d'impression 3D, ces tokens bénéficient à la fois d'une esthétique léchée encore plus immersive et aussi d'une forme qui facilite leur rangement !</p>
<p><b>Le Format Starter</b> !</p>

<p></p>
<p>- 10 tokens SHIELD
</p>
<p>- 10 tokens LOCK (pairs de A à E)<br/></p>
<p>- 5  tokens EVADE</p>
<p>- 5 tokens FOCUS</p>
<p>- 5 tokens STRESS</p>
<p><b>Les Blisters**</b> !</p>

<i>* Ceci n'est pas le packaging final (il manque encore la cartonnette produit dans chaque blister)</i><br/>Ce sont les joueurs qui choisissent leur blister. Chacun d'entre eux contient 8 tokens. Un premier choix:<br/>8 EVADE<br/>8 LOCKS (F/F, G/G, H/H, I/I)<br/>8 STRESS<br/>8 FOCUS<br/>8 SHIELDS<br/><br/>Selon les niveaux d'objectif atteints sur ce financement participatif, il sera possible de débloquer de nouveaux blisters, dont le design sera aussi soumis à la communauté!<br/><br/><b>DE NOUVEAUX TOKENS A DEBLOQUER:</b><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1156611/files/20150118041641-GoZuZoneCampaign.png?1421583401"" src="""" style=""width: 526.508px; height: 321px;""/></p>Le Packaging: il contient les membres de la communauté ayant participé à certaines face du développement du produit (discussion sur le starter de base, remarque sur l'esthétique du produit, test des tokens...). <p><br/></p>
<p><b>Gozu Zone, un concepteur et fabricant d'accessoires de jeux ayant déjà fait ses preuves.</b></p>
<p>Grâce à son utilisation des avantages de l'impression 3D, Gozu zone est le plus local et innovant des fabricants d'accessoires pour les jeux ! Nous en avons démontré la preuve avec la création et la <a href=""http://gozu.zone/?product=asteroids"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fabrication du set d'astéroïdes compatible X Wing qui cartonne dans les boutiques de jeux</a> ! Cela nous a permis d'acquérir une première solide expérience du travail avec les boutiques de jeux et de la maîtrise de notre production.</p>
<b>Une participation efficace de la communauté autour des tokens 3D !<br/></b><p>Les membres de la communauté ont pu donner leur avis sur la composition du starter de base, afin d'avoir un consensus sur une répartition équilibrée de tokens. Les joueurs ont aussi présenté des innovations et évolutions possibles pour les améliorer.<br/></p>
<p><b>Un financement participatif pour passer à la vitesse supérieure! </b><br/></p>
<p>Nous faisons appel au financement participatif pour ce projet afin de déverrouiller nos capacités de production, aujourd'hui limitées, à avancer nos dépenses de packaging, qui sont importantes et à faire plus parler de nous, et à faciliter notre installation dans de nouveaux locaux qui nous permettront de répondre aux besoins des joueurs!<br/></p>
<p><b>Un projet qui aura d'importantes répercussions sur le monde de jeu</b><br/></p>
<p>Ces tokens marquent un tournant dans le gameplay des joueurs: il est maintenant possible de développer toute une gamme de pièces avec des formes plus complexes et s'adressant aux besoins spécifiques des joueurs (immersivité des pièces, pièces plus faciles à saisir, à ranger, à identifier sur le tapis de jeu...)<br/></p>
</div><b>Des boutiques partenaires</b> <b>qui nous soutiennent</b> <b>!</b><br/><br/>De nombreuses boutiques se prêtent au jeu de ce financement participatif !

<h3>Risques et défis</h3>
<p><b>Une production déjà éprouvée et prête à tourner !<br/></b></p>
<p>Les risques de retard peuvent être entraînés par la réalisation du packaging final, la livraison de nouvelles machines et leur préparation et l'installation d'une nouvelle ligne de production.</p>
<p>S'agissant du premier point, nous avons déjà l'habitude de travailler avec des prestataires locaux assez réactifs qui devraient pouvoir réagir en quelques jours. Les machines devraient être livrées dans le temps car la période de clôture du financement participatif correspond à un nouveau réassort. Enfin, la plupart des tokens ont déjà été profilés et testés pour notre nouvelle ligne de production.<br/></p>

Dans tous les cas, si un retard se produit, nous garderons 
l'ordre de priorité de livraison (LEVE-TÔT + boutiques) et celui-ci 
devrait être raisonnable, compte tenu de notre expérience déjà accumulée
 sur une petite série.<b><br/><br/>Comment nous aider!</b>
<p>Faites passer le mot auprès de votre communauté ! Les organisateurs de tournoi d'X Wing pourront se voir offrir un blister de shields à offrir en prix à leurs joueurs.<br/></p>
<p><i>* Les tokens 3D de Gozu Zone ont été créé pour être compatible avec le jeu de plateau X Wing, édité par Edge en France. Gozu Zone n'est pas affilié avec Edge et ils ne cautionnent pas nos produits.</i><br/>** <i>Ceci n'est pas le packaging final des blisters : nous allons ajouter une cartonnette mentionnant le nom du produit et ajoutant les informations légales demandées.</i><br/></p>

Une nouvelle génération de tokens 3D compatibles avec X Wing* est née !

** MISE A JOUR 1 ** 21/01/15
Nous venons d'ajouter une nouvelle fonctionnalité au rangement en nid d'abeille : il est désormais possible de sortir les tokens un à un !

Devenez pionnier en participant au financement de la première génération de tokens en relief compatibles avec X Wing  ! 
S'appuyant sur la technologie d'impression 3D, ces tokens bénéficient à la fois d'une esthétique léchée encore plus immersive et aussi d'une forme qui facilite leur rangement !
Le Format Starter !

Il contient les 35 tokens de base discutés avec la communauté + 1 rangement en forme de nid d'abeille, soit :

- 10 tokens SHIELD

- 10 tokens LOCK (pairs de A à E)
- 5  tokens EVADE
- 5 tokens FOCUS
- 5 tokens STRESS
Les Blisters** !


* Ceci n'est pas le packaging final (il manque encore la cartonnette produit dans chaque blister)Ce sont les joueurs qui choisissent leur blister. Chacun d'entre eux contient 8 tokens. Un premier choix:8 EVADE8 LOCKS (F/F, G/G, H/H, I/I)8 STRESS8 FOCUS8 SHIELDSSelon les niveaux d'objectif atteints sur ce financement participatif, il sera possible de débloquer de nouveaux blisters, dont le design sera aussi soumis à la communauté!DE NOUVEAUX TOKENS A DEBLOQUER:Le Packaging: il contient les membres de la communauté ayant participé à certaines face du développement du produit (discussion sur le starter de base, remarque sur l'esthétique du produit, test des tokens...). 
Gozu Zone, un concepteur et fabricant d'accessoires de jeux ayant déjà fait ses preuves.
Grâce à son utilisation des avantages de l'impression 3D, Gozu zone est le plus local et innovant des fabricants d'accessoires pour les jeux ! Nous en avons démontré la preuve avec la création et la fabrication du set d'astéroïdes compatible X Wing qui cartonne dans les boutiques de jeux ! Cela nous a permis d'acquérir une première solide expérience du travail avec les boutiques de jeux et de la maîtrise de notre production.
Une participation efficace de la communauté autour des tokens 3D !Les membres de la communauté ont pu donner leur avis sur la composition du starter de base, afin d'avoir un consensus sur une répartition équilibrée de tokens. Les joueurs ont aussi présenté des innovations et évolutions possibles pour les améliorer.
Un financement participatif pour passer à la vitesse supérieure! 
Nous faisons appel au financement participatif pour ce projet afin de déverrouiller nos capacités de production, aujourd'hui limitées, à avancer nos dépenses de packaging, qui sont importantes et à faire plus parler de nous, et à faciliter notre installation dans de nouveaux locaux qui nous permettront de répondre aux besoins des joueurs!
Un projet qui aura d'importantes répercussions sur le monde de jeu
Ces tokens marquent un tournant dans le gameplay des joueurs: il est maintenant possible de développer toute une gamme de pièces avec des formes plus complexes et s'adressant aux besoins spécifiques des joueurs (immersivité des pièces, pièces plus faciles à saisir, à ranger, à identifier sur le tapis de jeu...)
Des boutiques partenaires qui nous soutiennent !De nombreuses boutiques se prêtent au jeu de ce financement participatif ! Les joueurs qui passent commande en boutique économiseront sur les frais de port et seront livrés en même temps que les lots ""lève-tôt"" !Vous pourrez aussi regarder et toucher le token Shield qui se trouve sur le support du teaser !Si vous souhaitez que votre boutique se joigne à ce financement participatif, n'hésitez pas à nous écrire afin que nous puissions la contacter !Liste non définitive et susceptible d'évoluer pendant la campagneLes autres boutiques dans lesquelles vous pouvez venir examiner un échantillon de token !GRENOBLE:HobbyshopLILLE:Hobby MaxRocamboleLYON:Descartes LyonUkronium 1828MARSEILLE:Role GamesMETZ:Petit PeupleVERSAILLES:Appel du dé
Risques et défis
Une production déjà éprouvée et prête à tourner !
Les risques de retard peuvent être entraînés par la réalisation du packaging final, la livraison de nouvelles machines et leur préparation et l'installation d'une nouvelle ligne de production.
S'agissant du premier point, nous avons déjà l'habitude de travailler avec des prestataires locaux assez réactifs qui devraient pouvoir réagir en quelques jours. Les machines devraient être livrées dans le temps car la période de clôture du financement participatif correspond à un nouveau réassort. Enfin, la plupart des tokens ont déjà été profilés et testés pour notre nouvelle ligne de production.

Dans tous les cas, si un retard se produit, nous garderons 
l'ordre de priorité de livraison (LEVE-TÔT + boutiques) et celui-ci 
devrait être raisonnable, compte tenu de notre expérience déjà accumulée
 sur une petite série.Comment nous aider!
Faites passer le mot auprès de votre communauté ! Les organisateurs de tournoi d'X Wing pourront se voir offrir un blister de shields à offrir en prix à leurs joueurs.
* Les tokens 3D de Gozu Zone ont été créé pour être compatible avec le jeu de plateau X Wing, édité par Edge en France. Gozu Zone n'est pas affilié avec Edge et ils ne cautionnent pas nos produits.** Ceci n'est pas le packaging final des blisters : nous allons ajouter une cartonnette mentionnant le nom du produit et ajoutant les informations légales demandées.

<p>First of
all, we’d like to introduce ourselves. Yes, we’re 7D Studio but, more than
that, we’re people with dreams, we’re a family literally. One of our greatest
passions in life has to do with videogames. Back in time, when we were kids, we
used to play different games for hours. Once, our youngest brother, amused by
the powerful game console at that time, the PSX 1, said while we were playing

<p><b><i>About Monkey in Space Project...</i></b></p>
<p>The game we’re

Project. </i>This is a 3D game with state-of-the-art mobile graphics designed for
iOS and Android operating systems. However, we’re planning to release a special

<p>To finish
this videogame in particular (<i>Monkey in

First of
all, we’d like to introduce ourselves. Yes, we’re 7D Studio but, more than
that, we’re people with dreams, we’re a family literally. One of our greatest
passions in life has to do with videogames. Back in time, when we were kids, we
used to play different games for hours. Once, our youngest brother, amused by
the powerful game console at that time, the PSX 1, said while we were playing
Metal Gear Solid: “when I grow up, I’ll create my own games”. We didn’t stop
laughing. In fact, those were big words. Although we never believed, it finally
happened.

Project: Gorgon is currently in the alpha stage of development and with every update that we roll out we move closer to launching on Stream Early Access. Once we launch on Steam Early Access we will have officially moved from the alpha stage of development to early beta.</p><p>Last year we ran a successful Kickstarter Campaign which allowed players from around the world show their interest in Project: Gorgon. Since that time, we’ve made significant progress in setting a solid foundation for Project: Gorgon. We’ve designed, developed and implemented three new zones along with an entirely unique new player experience. We have implemented dozens of new skills and have added a large number of new items. We’ve added a new animal-friendly town for those players who wish to play one of our unique animal experiences. We’ve completely overhauled our power system and equipment bonuses. We completely rewrote our camera system. We’ve made significant changes to the quest system, added NPCS, guilds, guild missions, player vendors, dispensers, work orders, drowning and a lot of other features. In addition, we’ve recently introduced the Knife skill which is a precursor to the Fairy race and we are currently in the process of a complete GUI overhaul! There are countless other changes, but this should give you a solid understanding of the progress we are making since our initial Kickstarter campaign.</p><p>We’ve decided to run an Indiegogo Campaign for multiple reasons and in order to be transparent we wanted to share those with everyone. Since our Kickstarter Campaign, we’ve had people from around the world interested in supporting Project: Gorgon but the Kickstarter Campaign only accepted credit card payments. There has always been a high level of interest from those who would like to contribute via PayPal, but until now that hasn’t been an option. Indiegogo will allow interested parties to donate to Project: Gorgon using either a credit or PayPal so it opens that additional avenue of support to players who missed out on the opportunity the first time around. Additionally, Project: Gorgon is currently pre-revenue and since our last Kickstarter Campaign ended we have had no incoming revenue but we continue to incur development costs including server costs, contracted development help, contracted artists, and other costs related to the overall development of Project: Gorgon. Finally, this campaign will allow us to raise additional funds which will be used to implement upon existing, planned, and “wish list” game features.</p><p>We are extremely grateful for those who are able to donate to Project: Gorgon, but if you are unable to financially support us at this time it would be extremely valuable if you were able to post about Project: Gorgon on third party websites. Alternatively, mentioning Project: Gorgon on your social media pages is a great way to spread the word.

<h1><strong>THE OLD SCHOOL MMO RPG RETURNS</strong></h1>
<p>Do you remember Ultima Online, early days of Everquest 1 or other games from that era?</p>
<p>Do you remember the days when MMO Role-Playing Games were actually about RPG, deep immersion in the game world and a community of like minded players?</p>
<p>We teamed up to create a new old-school MMO RPG which brings all that back.</p>
<p>World of Midgard is a multi-platform, old-school 3D MMO RPG core game, the kind you used to enjoy in the past, now about to be brought to your Mac &amp; PC and mobile devices (Android, iOS).</p>
<p>All players will play on the same servers.</p>
<p>How many times you wished to be able to take your PC or Mac game with you? </p>
<p>Well now you are about to be able to.</p>

<p>Because of long apple approval times iOS beta version has still old user interface. We plan to have Linux beta version next month.</p>

THE OLD SCHOOL MMO RPG RETURNS
Do you remember Ultima Online, early days of Everquest 1 or other games from that era?
Do you remember the days when MMO Role-Playing Games were actually about RPG, deep immersion in the game world and a community of like minded players?
We teamed up to create a new old-school MMO RPG which brings all that back.
World of Midgard is a multi-platform, old-school 3D MMO RPG core game, the kind you used to enjoy in the past, now about to be brought to your Mac & PC and mobile devices (Android, iOS).
All players will play on the same servers.
How many times you wished to be able to take your PC or Mac game with you? 
Well now you are about to be able to.
Click here to download beta version of the game for Mac & PC, Android & iOS 
Because of long apple approval times iOS beta version has still old user interface. We plan to have Linux beta version next month.

name is John Caballero, I work as a full time tutor, private consultant, and
all of my time otherwise goes into my company and this project.  Welcome! 
To the Apocalypse Survival Guide Project!</p>
<p>This project started almost two years ago during the night
of Hurricane Sandy.  I laid in bed
frustrated because I had no power, no food, and no way to reach any of my loved
ones.  I was in a position where I
couldn’t help myself, or other people. 
The only thing I could really do was use my phone.  That realization is what gave me the idea for
the project.  I immediately designed and
started creating an app to help people plan for and get through disasters.  At the time a lot of people were freaking out
about the Mayan prophecies and 2012.  So…
I decided to use that to help get more attention.  Once I did that I quickly added Zombies
simply for the entertainment value.  I
knew a big issue I had from the start is that people don’t like to plan for
disasters.  They like to say “oh it’ll
never happen to me”.  Or worse yet, they
just plead ignorance because they would rather not think about it.  I figured I could use something entertaining
like zombies to get people interested while still giving them the tools to make
a real plan and actually be prepared. 
Kind of like tricking people into helping themselves.  That’s been the main thought process behind
everything we’ve done.  Let me take your
through the steps.</p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Step 1:  The ASG App</span></h1>
<p>So here’s where the whole process starts, the Apocalypse
Survival Guide app.  Currently we only
have it out for iOS (hopefully you can help with that), and after almost 2
years of work it finally has full functionality.  We’ve divided all disasters you can plan for
by using eight different apocalypses.  We
know that the word apocalypse can come off as very fictional and silly, but
this app is filled with nothing but facts. 
I spent over a month on each apocalypse creating the most factual,
concise, what you should know description for each one.  Each apocalypse also has tips of what you
should do before, during and after disaster strikes.  Along with all this useful information is a
GPS that helps you find resources based on different categories specific for
the apocalypse you’re looking at.  You
can save these locations and they get stored into the app.  If you lose internet for some strange reason,
not to worry!  All of these addresses can
be seen offline so you can still use them. 
Remember, the idea for the app started the night of Hurricane Sandy, so
it’s meant to be as applicable as possible. 
Along with the GPS there are different kits you can fill out, the
ability to add friends, see their plans, and of course make your own
plans.  The purpose of the app is so that
you can make a plan for yourself in case of any disaster.  Even if you plan with other people, family,
friends, whoever, you never know what’s actually going to happen, and heaven
forbid you’re all alone, this plan is for you. 
Don’t worry though, if you choose to leave your plans public, or visible
to your friends, you can all see each other’s plans.  Even if you all lose internet and can’t
communicate with each other, you can still see everyone’s plan and find out
what they are planning to do.</p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Step 2:  The Facebook
App</h1>
<p>I forgot to mention one thing about the app.  Each Apocalypse has a unique analyzer that
gives you your chance of surviving alone. 
It asks questions about where you’re from, what you know, what you can
do, and what you’re willing to do.  It’s
actually really fun to do.  After the
analyzer tells you your chances, your score is uploaded to the Facebook
app.  This took a lot of time and work
also, but this part of the process is meant to be a bridge between the ASG app
and the ASG website.  With the Facebook
App you can see your scores, as well as the scores of all your friends.  You can all compare, brag, make fun, and
overall just see where everyone stands. 
You can also see everyone’s plans, group plans, and how prepared they
are.  The app will suggest people from
your friends list that you should make a plan with, based on their scores and
how prepared they are.  The Facebook app
is all about getting people into the mind set of planning together.  </p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Step 3:  The ASG
Website</h1>
<p>Finally, we come to the heart of the project.  The website is filled with all kinds of
really cool, helpful, fun and applicable things.  You should definitely check it out when you
get the chance!  By far the most
important thing in the website is the group plans.  Like I mentioned before, one of the biggest
obstacles for this project is the fact that people don’t like to plan for
disasters.  We designed and created a way
for people to sit down, and without any forethought can just make an entire
plan from start to end.  Without any
prior planning any person can create a plan for as many people as they want
(friends, class, family, etc) that has rendezvous points, policies, supplies,
and can assign everyone a role.  Roles
are a revolutionary idea we had that we feel is really going to help people get
into this.  What would you be?  A hunter? 
A scavenger?  A scout, cook,
ambassador, farmer, zoo keeper, etc.  The
roles help people define where you fit, and it makes sure that everyone can
contribute to the group with the best of their abilities.  </p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">What’s Going On Now</h1>
<p>We’ve spent the better of two years working on these
different steps to make the whole process as easy to use as possible.  It’s been a lot of work but it’s definitely
worth it.  I already had someone message
me because after a small disaster, she was able to use the app to get gas and
help her out.  That in itself already
makes this entire project worth it.  We
have a huge marketing plan but before we could move forward with that we wanted
to make sure the pieces were all done and the functionality part of the project
was complete.  The marketing plan was
hard to come up with.  When you have a
product or service you’re supposed to choose a main demographic and target
them.  Our biggest issue was that this
project can and is meant to help everyone. 
Therefore after a lot of thought we had to stick with everyone as our
demographic.  Because of that we decided
to create a web series with every demographic, designed to help us reach as
many demographics as possible.  We’ve
been to a few conventions but that was mostly to collect data and find out how
to make things more user friendly.  Right
now we’re planning to go to NYCC 2014 with the main focus of showing off the completed
project and to get help with the web series. 
We need help to get to that point.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What’s Next and How You Can Help</h2>
<p>Hopefully you have a full grasp of how we got here, why we
got here, and what we’re trying to do. 
We have a lot of social medias, (that you should all check out!) as well
as contests, blogs, newspapers, etc. 
I’ve been funding this all myself up to this point, the app, facebook,
website, conventions, marketing.. all of it. 
I’ve been working three jobs just to make this happen.  I can’t tell you how happy I am to finally be
at this stage and be able to tell you all this. 
Unfortunately this is where I could use some serious help.  First of all, I need to make sure all of the
functionality of the project is complete: the app, website, fb app, and
everything else connected to this project. 
That is first and foremost.  If
you guys help enough I’ll be able to start the Android version of this app and
hopefully get it done before NYCC 2014. 
Secondly is NYCC itself.  I was
there last year with a few people and we got very positive reviews.  I was not there to make a buck however and it
ended up hurting my wallet quite a bit. 
Took me like two months to recover from that.  This year we have double the space, more
equipment and we plan on doing a lot more. 
Last year we had amazing makeup artists paint people up into really
gruesome zombies.  Some of those people
were chained up and helped us terrorize passersby.  This year the makeup artists are coming back
and we not only plan on stepping up the makeup, but we will also be locking our
newly made zombies into cages for everyone to see.  It’s going to be a lot of fun.  We will also have a couple of the web series
actors in full apocalyptic costume as well as a couple other surprises.  The more funding we can get for this the
better.  The booth is expensive enough,
as well as the supplies needed. Any additional funding will go into all of the marketing
material that we need to bring.  Finally,
we have the web series.  This indiegogo
campaign is more about the project and how important it is.  We will be creating another crowdfunding
campaign during October to show people during the convention.  The web series has a professional composer
helping us with the soundtrack, amazing make up, very talented costume designers
and a crazy good script.  We’re really
pulling out all the stops for this since we need it to get as much attention as
possible (to get as much attention as possible to the project).  That said, we are filming some background
stuff to show during NYCC before we get the funding needed to shoot the rest of
the web series.  Any extra funds we get
from you guys will go to helping the success of this campaign and helping us
film, create, and shoot whatever we need for it (including the very expensive
trailer we need to make).  </p><p><br/></p><p>Directly where the funding will go:</p><p>1.  Finishing the functionality of the project ($15,000):  Finishing the iOS app, the ASG website, the FB app, Group Plans, and anything else needed for the whole process to work.  </p><p>2.  NYCC 2014 ($15,000):  Paying for the booth, make up, cage, props, renting a huge monitor, flyers, booklets, t-shirts, etc.</p><p>3. Trailer ($10,000):  Even though this is 3rd, this is a big one.  We are making a trailer for the ASG Web Series (main marketing tool) that has to be done by NYCC.  We have original costumes, a lot of actors, a lot of props, an original music score, and a bunch of other stuff going into this series.  The more funding we get for the trailer, the better we'll look at NYCC, and the more support we can get for the web series.  </p><p>Extra funding will be dedicated to:</p><p>1.  Android ($10,000):  Making the Android version of the app and integrating it with the rest of the project.</p><p>2.  Marketing ($5,000):  Getting enough marketing material for NYCC 2014 (We always run out of supplies with the amount of volume we consistently get).</p><p>3.  Filming ($$$$):  A film budget can be endless, the more money you have, the better props, make up, clothing, cameras, etc.  If everything else has been dealt with and we get extra revenue.  Meaning that functionality and NYCC have been paid and decked out to their full extreme (which would be crazy awesome), then that extra revenue will go into making the trailer and webseries as amazing as possible.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">The End?</h1>
<p>That was a lot.  But,
we wanted to make sure you guys knew where we were and where we were coming
from.  Any help we can get would be
greatly appreciated.  One last thing I
forgot to mention.  It’s about the
website and the group plans.  We are
making something called the Apocalypse Survival Notebooks.  Basically, we take your group plans and make
a book out of them.  The book will have
whatever cover you want, an index, group plans, individual plans, everyone’s
emergency contact info, pictures and addresses you’ve saved, and critical
information about the roles you have selected to be in your plans.  Overall, it’s the ultimate disaster plan,
catered specifically for you. They’ve been really hard to manufacture since
they are made individually, but they are the end of a long, productive
process.  We’re hoping they catch on and
people get them, not just for the entertainment value, but also because of how
cool and helpful they can really be.  We
are including them in the rewards and will be using you guys to help us make
sure they work and can be made like we want them too.  If at any point any of you guys have any
questions, comments, thoughts, or whatever else about the project, feel free to
hit us up.  All of our social medias are
below.  We really appreciate it.  Have a good day!</p><p></p></div>","Hey Indiegogo!  My

pulling out all the stops for this since we need it to get as much attention as
possible (to get as much attention as possible to the project).  That said, we are filming some background
stuff to show during NYCC before we get the funding needed to shoot the rest of
the web series.  Any extra funds we get
from you guys will go to helping the success of this campaign and helping us
film, create, and shoot whatever we need for it (including the very expensive
trailer we need to make).  Directly where the funding will go:1.  Finishing the functionality of the project ($15,000):  Finishing the iOS app, the ASG website, the FB app, Group Plans, and anything else needed for the whole process to work.  2.  NYCC 2014 ($15,000):  Paying for the booth, make up, cage, props, renting a huge monitor, flyers, booklets, t-shirts, etc.3. Trailer ($10,000):  Even though this is 3rd, this is a big one.  We are making a trailer for the ASG Web Series (main marketing tool) that has to be done by NYCC.  We have original costumes, a lot of actors, a lot of props, an original music score, and a bunch of other stuff going into this series.  The more funding we get for the trailer, the better we'll look at NYCC, and the more support we can get for the web series.  Extra funding will be dedicated to:1.  Android ($10,000):  Making the Android version of the app and integrating it with the rest of the project.2.  Marketing ($5,000):  Getting enough marketing material for NYCC 2014 (We always run out of supplies with the amount of volume we consistently get).3.  Filming ($$$$):  A film budget can be endless, the more money you have, the better props, make up, clothing, cameras, etc.  If everything else has been dealt with and we get extra revenue.  Meaning that functionality and NYCC have been paid and decked out to their full extreme (which would be crazy awesome), then that extra revenue will go into making the trailer and webseries as amazing as possible.
The End?
That was a lot.  But,
we wanted to make sure you guys knew where we were and where we were coming
from.  Any help we can get would be
greatly appreciated.  One last thing I
forgot to mention.  It’s about the
website and the group plans.  We are
making something called the Apocalypse Survival Notebooks.  Basically, we take your group plans and make
a book out of them.  The book will have
whatever cover you want, an index, group plans, individual plans, everyone’s
emergency contact info, pictures and addresses you’ve saved, and critical
information about the roles you have selected to be in your plans.  Overall, it’s the ultimate disaster plan,
catered specifically for you. They’ve been really hard to manufacture since
they are made individually, but they are the end of a long, productive
process.  We’re hoping they catch on and
people get them, not just for the entertainment value, but also because of how
cool and helpful they can really be.  We
are including them in the rewards and will be using you guys to help us make
sure they work and can be made like we want them too.  If at any point any of you guys have any
questions, comments, thoughts, or whatever else about the project, feel free to
hit us up.  All of our social medias are
below.  We really appreciate it.  Have a good day!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>There's a War in the Shadows...</h3>
<p>The world of<strong> Contagion</strong> is a dark and terrifying place. On the surface it is no different than the world you and I live in. Most people go on about their lives never realizing the terrors that walk among them.<br/>Despite humanity’s vast ignorance, the horrors are there. Angels and demons make war in the shadows. Hellspawn serve their demonic masters. Clergy and Slayers rise from the human flock to protect their brethren and work God's will.</p>
<p>There's a war in the shadows. Choose a side.</p>
<p><strong>Contagion</strong> is a modern horror/ urban fantasy game that I began publishing back in 2004. Using the Open Game License system, my partners and I created a world of wonder and horror in which players could make fantastic characters and tell unique stories of dark adventure.</p>
<p>Though I had been enjoying the hobby of tabletop gaming for over a decade at the time, I had not had any game design experience when I began work on <strong>Contagion</strong>. I chose the OGL system to work with, in part due to its massive popularity, but also because it was a tested and developed system that would not require an immense overhaoul on my part. I, along with my partners Darius McCaskkey and Toy Cesar, did make some changes in order to make the system fit the vision we had for the <strong>Contagion</strong> setting, but we left the core rules of the OGL system largely intact.</p>
<p>Now, nearly a decade later, I feel it is time to revisit the core rules of the <strong>Contagion</strong> roleplaying game and create a new, better edition. Over the last ten years, I've refined my craft in the field of game design, having put together thousands of pages worth of supplemental material for Contagion as well as creating additional game worlds for other products. When I created <strong>Contagion</strong> I crafted a world and made it conform to a game system. With <strong>Contagion Second Edition</strong> I intend to rebuild the game system to better reflect the world of <strong>Contagion</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Contagion Second Edition</strong> will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Revisit and refine playable races to ensure game balance while preserving the unique modern horror and urban fantasy elements of <strong>Contagion</strong>.</li>
<li>Reconstruct the concepts of character class and occupation to streamline character advancement and place more control of character development in the player's hands.</li>
<li>Improve and expand upon the magic system.</li>
<li>Incorporate old and new supplemental material in additon to the core system all under one cover.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The finished <strong>Contagion Second Edition</strong> book will be a massive undertaking. I anticipate the book to be somewhere in the 400-600 page range when it is completed. System development, layout and proofreading for a tome of this size will be a time-consuming process. I will also need to compile art and generate new fiction to accompany the rules updates. In light of all of those things I have set a basic fundraising goal of $500 which will pay for the proofreading, typesetting and development time as well as getting some new art and covering the cost of a printed proof. But the $500 goal is only the beginning. I have a ton of additional ideas I'd like to see happen with <strong>Contagion Second Edition</strong>. To reflect this I am announcing some additional benchmark goals in the hopes that you can help me push the world of <strong>Contagion</strong> to new heights in 2013!</p>
<p>Our goals are:</p>
<ul>
<li>$500 - Basic Goal: I will generate the <strong>Contagion Second Edition</strong> corebook with updated setting and system information. The book will be available in .pdf, softcover and hardcover black and white print editions. Helping us reach this goal will give you access to these new books as well as some of our classic <strong>Contagion</strong> products. All .pdfs and print products will be provided through <a href=""http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DriveThruRPG</a>.</li>
<li>$1000 - Tier 1 Advanced Goal: Rather than Black and White versions of <strong>Contagion Second Edition</strong>, all print copies will be in full color.</li>
<li>$1250 - Tier 2 Advanced Goal: in addition to the <strong>Contagion Second Edition</strong> corebook, we will produce a 22-page .pdf file of an issue of the <em>Global News Inquisitor,</em> the supermarket tabloid that offers a glimpse behind the scenes in the world of <strong>Contagion</strong>. This .pdf will be distributed to all contributors at the $5 level or higher in addition to their other perks. This .pdf will be completed by July of 2013.</li>
<li>$1500 - Tier 3 Advanced Goal: <a href=""http://www.aegisstudios.com/film"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Plastic Age Productions</a> will produce a short film (of a running time of 5-10 minutes) set in the world of <strong>Contagion</strong> which will be distributed digitally for free, exlusively to backers at the $30 level or above. The film will be completed by August of 2013.</li>
<li>$2000 - Tier 4 Advanced Goal: If we reach this level of funding, we will distribute the short film digitally, for free to all backers at the $5 level or above.</li>
<li>$2500 - Tier 5 Advanced Goal: If we reach this level of funding, we will generate a new short fiction anthology set in the world of Contagion, which will be provided free in .pdf format to all backers at a level of $5 or more. This will be delivered by December 2013. We will also open up the short film to all backers.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ten years ago my partners and I took the leap into game development and self-publishing. We all made huge sacrifices of time to try and build a new world we could share with an audience , a world where people could tell stories with their friends and have a great time. Now, ten years later, I intend to refine the ideas set forth in the original <strong>Contagion</strong> books and take the experience for the player to the next level. Your contribution and support can help make that happen!</p>
Over the past decade <strong>Contagion</strong> has received critical acclaim, been certified as a Copper Best Seller at DriveThruRPG.com and spawned over twenty supplemental products. I believe with the ideas I have for <strong>Contagion Second Edition</strong> this will prove to be only the beginning. <br/><br/>You can learn more about <strong>Contagion</strong> by visiting <a href=""http://rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/11944/Contagion"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/11944/Contagion</a>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that times are rough and you may not be in a position to help financially. We also get that modern horror or urban fantasy gaming just might not be your thing. However, it may very well be someone you know's thing, and sharing a link is free, so there are still several ways that you could lend us a hand:</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle for independent productions of any kind is simply getting the word out. Without access to advertising dollars, our reach is limited to word-of -mouth. With social media YOU can be of immense help by simply sharing the link to this project and telling your friends about it. Ask them to do the same!</p>
Please use the Indiegogo share tools, post links on your Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and all of your social media sites.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Visit the Contagion RPG Facebook page <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/ContagionRpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.facebook.com/ContagionRpg</a> Like it and tell your friends to do the same. <br/><br/>Thank you so much for your help and support!<br/><br/>NOTE: All international (Outside the U.S.) backers PLEASE include an additional $10 to your contribution for print products to offset shipping costs.</div></div>","There's a War in the Shadows...

Revisit and refine playable races to ensure game balance while preserving the unique modern horror and urban fantasy elements of Contagion.
Reconstruct the concepts of character class and occupation to streamline character advancement and place more control of character development in the player's hands.
Improve and expand upon the magic system.
Incorporate old and new supplemental material in additon to the core system all under one cover.



What We Need & What You Get
The finished Contagion Second Edition book will be a massive undertaking. I anticipate the book to be somewhere in the 400-600 page range when it is completed. System development, layout and proofreading for a tome of this size will be a time-consuming process. I will also need to compile art and generate new fiction to accompany the rules updates. In light of all of those things I have set a basic fundraising goal of $500 which will pay for the proofreading, typesetting and development time as well as getting some new art and covering the cost of a printed proof. But the $500 goal is only the beginning. I have a ton of additional ideas I'd like to see happen with Contagion Second Edition. To reflect this I am announcing some additional benchmark goals in the hopes that you can help me push the world of Contagion to new heights in 2013!
Our goals are:

$500 - Basic Goal: I will generate the Contagion Second Edition corebook with updated setting and system information. The book will be available in .pdf, softcover and hardcover black and white print editions. Helping us reach this goal will give you access to these new books as well as some of our classic Contagion products. All .pdfs and print products will be provided through DriveThruRPG.
$1000 - Tier 1 Advanced Goal: Rather than Black and White versions of Contagion Second Edition, all print copies will be in full color.
$1250 - Tier 2 Advanced Goal: in addition to the Contagion Second Edition corebook, we will produce a 22-page .pdf file of an issue of the Global News Inquisitor, the supermarket tabloid that offers a glimpse behind the scenes in the world of Contagion. This .pdf will be distributed to all contributors at the $5 level or higher in addition to their other perks. This .pdf will be completed by July of 2013.
$1500 - Tier 3 Advanced Goal: Plastic Age Productions will produce a short film (of a running time of 5-10 minutes) set in the world of Contagion which will be distributed digitally for free, exlusively to backers at the $30 level or above. The film will be completed by August of 2013.
$2000 - Tier 4 Advanced Goal: If we reach this level of funding, we will distribute the short film digitally, for free to all backers at the $5 level or above.
$2500 - Tier 5 Advanced Goal: If we reach this level of funding, we will generate a new short fiction anthology set in the world of Contagion, which will be provided free in .pdf format to all backers at a level of $5 or more. This will be delivered by December 2013. We will also open up the short film to all backers.



The Impact
Ten years ago my partners and I took the leap into game development and self-publishing. We all made huge sacrifices of time to try and build a new world we could share with an audience , a world where people could tell stories with their friends and have a great time. Now, ten years later, I intend to refine the ideas set forth in the original Contagion books and take the experience for the player to the next level. Your contribution and support can help make that happen!
Over the past decade Contagion has received critical acclaim, been certified as a Copper Best Seller at DriveThruRPG.com and spawned over twenty supplemental products. I believe with the ideas I have for Contagion Second Edition this will prove to be only the beginning. You can learn more about Contagion by visiting rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product/11944/Contagion


Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that times are rough and you may not be in a position to help financially. We also get that modern horror or urban fantasy gaming just might not be your thing. However, it may very well be someone you know's thing, and sharing a link is free, so there are still several ways that you could lend us a hand:
The biggest obstacle for independent productions of any kind is simply getting the word out. Without access to advertising dollars, our reach is limited to word-of -mouth. With social media YOU can be of immense help by simply sharing the link to this project and telling your friends about it. Ask them to do the same!
Please use the Indiegogo share tools, post links on your Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus and all of your social media sites.

As a result, different level structures arise.Yet both characters have different abilities, with which both can enter their own specific areas.While the first character brings the luck to the residents by the cleaning of chimneys, the second character brings it in form of gifts.Although it is possible to finish the game with only one character, but if you want to explore the whole world you have to use the characteristics of both characters.   The chimney sweep can reach higher places with his ladder, and with his cleaning tool he can clear out clogged chimneys and more. This makes it possible for him or the second character to enter hidden areas or even otherwise locked houses.SantaClaus can slip with magic through narrow tubes, can run light as a feather on the clouds and fly with his Christmas sleigh above the cities. Through this combination there is a lot to explore in the big cities. This allows to play the levels several times and finding secret places.These various cities can be reached via a world map, which one uncover more and more.   About me I am since 1994 in the games industry and worked at games like “Albion”, “The Settlers”, “Knights And Merchants”, as well as some jump and run platformers as “SantaClaus in Trouble” and “RossoRabbit”.Career Website: http://www.chimneyluck.eu/career.htmBut classic jump and runs are no longer in demand by the publishers, either there are huge graphical bombs or simple casual games.Therefore, I decide myself to venture to one.I hope you will allow me to achieve this with your help.FAQ

<p>Hi My name is Jerry Butler,</p>
<p>I've recently been asked ""when are you going to promote your inventions?"" So I got to thinking to myself, self what are you waiting on? Get moving Now! So I decided to reach out to this wonderful universe seeking for  help in making my dreams become a reality. </p>
<p>Back in 2004 I came up with this concept of a board game that would have peopled on the edge of their chair. It's fun and exciting to play. The name of the game is ""THE PIT"".  As I watched my family and friends play ""The Pit"", we saw that it needed a twist. So we decide to add crazy, and fun cards to the game. After a long night of creating cards, designs, layouts, etc... we notice that All families should have this game. However I never moved forward with the project.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2013, I put together a Vision Board with all the things I wanted to accomplish this year and guess what's on the board. That's right ""The Pit"". You see this game is not only for me, it will bring families back together from all over the globe for one more night of fun. There is nothing like sitting down with your family playing a good old board game.</p>
<p>Think of the magnitude your contributions who mean and helping me  achieve this goal. Not only me but, the jobs created in making the game board come to life.</p>
<p><strong><span>What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></strong></p>
<p>I am looking to raise <strong>$850</strong> or more to get  this game into production. I spoke with a graphic design company that's willing to help do the layout of this game. Good News: The company is here locate and has a track record of producing good quality content! That's a plus for us. I can be there any given time to make proper adjustments if needed as I watch ""The Pit"" come to life. The design company also mention they could help me find a company to produce the symbols for the game. Are you excited? YES, I am!</p>
<p>Once you have made a small donation, please let me know so I can personally thank you. Your voice will be heard all over the Net.<em><br/></em></p>
<p><strong><span>The Impact</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Not only will this board game create a fun family atmosphere but, it will teach the younger children's how to budget their money. Just imagine how many families would play this game if they had the one. What if you had a chance to seek contributions would you? How many times have you donated or just gave to charities or even a homeless person on the street? How did it make you feel? This is ground breaking so be the first to become part of it. After working the same job for over 20+ years, you think I would know when it's time to make a change.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<p>Please spread the word to your friends and family. You never know who's willing to give, and they may be in need. However, if you know you have that extra $1,$5,$10 or more laying around just Give. It's better to give then receive. It will return to you. So give from the heart and be blessed.</p>
<p>You can use this same system (Indiegogo) to run a similar campaign for any need.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>

</div></div>","Hi! We are a Colombian company focused in the interactive creation, we develop software for mobiles and right now we are in to game development. Fuchiball is a project that we started six months ago, when we were still students, and it has been really challenging since we don't have all the equipment that we need to fully acomplish the goal, we only have one device to emulate and test the game; but that have been enough to put the game in the Android market.                                                                                                            Check it!It has been in the market the last three weeks and we have receive a really good qualification and we are climbing the TOPs categories; but we need your help; We want to publish the game in the Apple market too.With your collaboration we will be able to afford all the costs that implies to develop for Apple: 
1 Mac to compile the app
1 apple device to do the emulations and tests
1 publisher account. 
As simple as it sound, thats all we need.Lets talk about the Game!From the marvelous tropical beaches of the Atlantic coast Kicke has arrived!, an amazing character with great talent, willing to show his own dad his great potential with Fuchi ability.   The gameplay takes place on the beach, where the player must help Kicke keep your record and make the necessary tricks to beat your friends. During the game, the player will encounter challenges and difficulties involved in maintaining the fuchi in the air, once it touches the sand, the game is lost. One of the difficulties is the movement control of the fuchi, factors such as wind, hit point on the fuchi and irregularity of tissue can cause unexpected behaviors which will measure your reflexes and agility to avoid losing the game. During the game, will appear starfishes, which come through the fascinating sound generated by kicks in the fuchi.                         Players must demonstrate their ability in handling the fuchi, and this requires making a move while the fuchi is in the air. Just as there are these stars, which help increase the score, there are characters that influence the score while playing; There are coconuts, octopus, fish balloons and sea urchins. Each has a different behavior and it alter the fuchi.                          Note: All power ups and dangers act for 5 seconds, once this time has passed, the fuchi and the environment returns to normal state. The fuchi is controlled by taps on the screen, but these should be directly in the fuchi, preventing it from falling and giving it direction. Tilt the phone will also help in the direction of the fuchi.               There are also tricks, these tricks are performed gestures on the screen, while the fuchi is in the air, and it must be done quickly before it falls.Cool: You must make a ""C"" while the fuchi is in the air, and you get 3 points. Fresh: You must make a letter ""O"" as the fuchi is in the air, and you'll get 5 points. Zager: You must make a letter ""Z"" as the fuchi is in the air, and you get 10 points. Fuchiball is storing your score to establish a record and place you in the top, so you can see what position you are and how close are your friends to you, or how much you lack to become number one.                                                                                     Try it! it'll be fun!

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.8999999761581421px;""><b>Biometric Enabled</b>- One feature that separates Super from your traditional bank card is that Super has a fingerprint sensor built into the actual card. As a safety measure, Super will only be able to make transactions once the owner's fingerprint is swiped and verified. In order to verify fingerprint, the card owner will swipe their finger once at the top of the card. Following the fingerprint's approval a green light will flash, indicating the Super is unlocked for 5 seconds and able to commit transactions.</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">                                       <p>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/372843/files/20140215230515-crowdfun.jpg?1392534315"" src="""" style=""width: 505.1951219512195px; height: 231px;""/></p></span>

In order to make transfers, the cardholder will use a mobile app that accompanies the card to first pair the Super and the mobile phone, (similar to pairing bluetooth but with higher security </span>measures<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">). After pairing the Super with the phone, the user will then select which account of theirs they would like to use for the transfer. Next, the user will input the amount they wish to transfer. Once the transfer details are input into the mobile app, the user will simply swipe their fingerprint on their Super to verify the transfer, and touch it with the Super they are transferring to. 5 seconds later, as quick as a hand shake, money transfer complete. No more making a stop to the ATM. No more writing checks, or waiting 3 to 4 days for bank transfers. With Super, pay or get paid, without the delay.</span><br/>

When you receive your Super, using the mobile app that accompanies the card, you will have the ability to link any of your financial accounts to your Super. This card will then be able to act as the primary card for your bank account anywhere that accepts traditional cards, including any pay pass, quick pay, or tap to pay terminals.<b> </b></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In summary, Super can stand as any of your bank cards, any of your credit cards and for the first time ever, with this new form of technology, it can stand as your physical money.</span>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Can Super only be used when you have a mobile phone? What if your battery dies? </span></h3>
<p></p><ul><li>
<span style=""font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">You will need a phone for the initial pairing process between the mobile application and your Super. Once this process is completed, a phone will only be required to input transfer information and to choose which account you would like Super to pay with. In the absence of your mobile phone, Super will still be able to transmit traditional transactions along with verifying for your approved fingerprint. However, it will only be able to stand as the last selected bank account until it gets back to the phone it is paired with.</span><br/>

<p></p><p></p></div>","Say Goodbye to Identity Theft, Bank Theft and Credit 
Card Attacks Forever. The Future of Money is here.We are Super. A newly formed microelectronics company located in Houston,Tx. You can visit us at www.SteelMoney.com for more information on our product.
  ""In the year 2013 more than 40 million people were victims of credit card information and identity theft, resulting in over $10 billion lost."" 

       You hear about computer crime in the news every day; Identity theft,  hackers raiding retail stores and stealing millions of customers’ credit card numbers or personal information and other scary news.  In response to this obvious issue that has affected so many American lives, we have created a technological solution to a seemingly unstoppable problem; the Super Steel MoneyCard (patent-pending).The world's first Biometric enabled, Microchip equipped Debit Card, that can work with anyone's bank account. 
What does this mean?
Biometric Enabled- One feature that separates Super from your traditional bank card is that Super has a fingerprint sensor built into the actual card. As a safety measure, Super will only be able to make transactions once the owner's fingerprint is swiped and verified. In order to verify fingerprint, the card owner will swipe their finger once at the top of the card. Following the fingerprint's approval a green light will flash, indicating the Super is unlocked for 5 seconds and able to commit transactions.                                         

Microchip Equipped-  Super is one of the first smart cards integrated with a new form of microchip that gives it the ability to connect with mobile phones, and instantly transfer money between cardholders. In order to make transfers, the cardholder will use a mobile app that accompanies the card to first pair the Super and the mobile phone, (similar to pairing bluetooth but with higher security measures). After pairing the Super with the phone, the user will then select which account of theirs they would like to use for the transfer. Next, the user will input the amount they wish to transfer. Once the transfer details are input into the mobile app, the user will simply swipe their fingerprint on their Super to verify the transfer, and touch it with the Super they are transferring to. 5 seconds later, as quick as a hand shake, money transfer complete. No more making a stop to the ATM. No more writing checks, or waiting 3 to 4 days for bank transfers. With Super, pay or get paid, without the delay.
                                
Debit/Credit Card- The reason why we say ""Debit/Credit Card"" is because Super is a universal mode of payment. When you receive your Super, using the mobile app that accompanies the card, you will have the ability to link any of your financial accounts to your Super. This card will then be able to act as the primary card for your bank account anywhere that accepts traditional cards, including any pay pass, quick pay, or tap to pay terminals. In summary, Super can stand as any of your bank cards, any of your credit cards and for the first time ever, with this new form of technology, it can stand as your physical money.
*Made of Stainless Steel    Frequently Asked Questions
Can Super only be used when you have a mobile phone? What if your battery dies? 

You will need a phone for the initial pairing process between the mobile application and your Super. Once this process is completed, a phone will only be required to input transfer information and to choose which account you would like Super to pay with. In the absence of your mobile phone, Super will still be able to transmit traditional transactions along with verifying for your approved fingerprint. However, it will only be able to stand as the last selected bank account until it gets back to the phone it is paired with.

What if I lose my phone, will I still be able to access my Super?

If the unfortunate situation of phone loss occurs,  Super will still be able to transmit traditional transactions along with verifying for your approved fingerprint. However, it will stand as the last selected bank account until you login to your online account and choose a different account and/or pair your card with your new device. In order to pair the new device you will be required to submit a request in your online account. You will then be contacted via email with instructions on how to get your replacement phone connected with your Super.

Is there a usage fee, or some type of interest I have to pay each time I use this card?

No, we do not take any percentage of any transaction. Once you purchase your Super it is fully yours, interest free. Hope you enjoy!

When will I receive my Super? 

Our goal is to have the first shipment sent out to our customers that pre-ordered by December of this year. Right in time to make to this holiday season a memorable one.

Is my phone compatible with Super?

Super is compatible with a range of cell phones already equipped with the software necessary to communicate with Super, primarily Android phones. If you do not have an Android, not to worry. We understand this technology is relatively new and not everyone would have a device equipped with this microchip. Each order will come with a pin sized chipped token that fits into the standard sized headphone port. With this token all phones will have the ability to pair with Super, and take part in all of its' super abilities. 

How will I use Super at a restaurant or a bar?  
We have programmed Super with a restaurant mode option that is initiated by swiping your finger 3 times on the finger sensor. Once in restaurant mode your card will be unlocked for 1 transaction. After the card is swiped one time, the card will automatically lock until the card owner's finger is swiped. What do we need?

Right now, as many companies in their beginning stages we do not have the neccesary funds to purchase the equipment needed to mass produce our first product, nor a place to call home that adequately accommodates the size of the equipment. With your help we can take Super from being a single prototype to being used worldwide!

What will you get?


25% off Super ($75) - For being apart of our startup, anyone that contributes $75 will automatically receive a Super at that discounted rate. ($100 retail) This payment also guarantees you will receive 1 of the first 10,000 Supers, which are only available to pre-ordering customers

We have met together one year ago with vision to
make a game which can become     revolutionary in the world of browser
games and provides new possibilities in cooperation of players, a lot
of fun and also provides a lot of competitive events. All right in
your webbrowser on all of your devices. We are finishing a developping process right now, all our friends, family are very
satisfied with a  game. We would like to fund our project beacuse of
starting fees for a game, servers, etc. are so expensive and we
are  student without money  for that.
Our guarantee for your money is a
perfect game, which we would like to introduce to you below.

Thank you.                      ABOUT GAME League of Clans is browser game which takes place in the medieval age, where you can play with one of three nations:  Vikings   tions Saracens  CrusadersEvery  nation have a different
economy, army and also graphics. The game will be the right in your
webbrowser and is based on a building your own town, conquering enemy
towns or creating new towns, stealing resources from enemies, trading,
and so much more. In your town you can upgrade buildings that are
already built or build new buildings. Increasing level of a building
always gives you more and more benefits. Each of the 18 buildings gives you specific advantages.You can also train troops in your town
and with them you can attack other towns, stealing resources etc. For
building and training troops you need a resources. There are 3 basic
resources in the game:   Wood    Stone     IronAlso in the every town
you have a quarries or mines, where the resources are coming from, etc. All this things and more you can do at the worlds with length about 30 days and you really won´t get bored.IN THE GAME             Map         (Vikings town)         (Saracens town)       (part of forest)          (part of desert)    (part of forest with stones)Map is the main coordination tool
in the game, you will see there all of towns in the world, you can
navigate yourself right there, you can see the distances of other
player´s  towns.  Map also creates enviroment for giving orders to
your army, merchars. Simply, it´s the source of some basic game
information.   Rebels                                                                 It´s something like NPC in the game, players see
them on the map, they can steal them resources, conquer their
villages and so on. They won´t attack real players but they have
some homeguards.              Monarch                                                                       In the game will be the Monarch. Every
player will have his own Monarch. We can say that it represents you
in game. Rank of the Monarch follows from the player´s current
skills. When you have a good ranked Monarch, the game becomes easier
for you...Logically, you can afford more things and your word on the
world is louder.                                                                                                    Cities                                                                      Cities will be added to the game in a certain
phase. In the middle of map is the ""Promised Land"". Players
must conquer this huge city and hold it for 24hours, then the world
will be closed and winners announced. Around the ""Promised Land"", there are another two types of cities, and it´s the
""Emperor´s"" and ""King´s""cities. They are
avalaible in the game 10 days sooner than the ""Promised Land""
and they are much bigger, richer and more useful than classic towns.
What is more, when the world ends, owners of Emperor´s and King´s cities are rewarded too. However these cities, should be owned by
player, with biggest rank of the Monarch as it´s possible, because
with a Monarch with small rank, it won´t be used as well as with big
rank.Buildings                                  (Vikings barracks)              (Vikings barrelhouse)                                     (Vikings farm)                   (Vikings market)                                                                                  (Vikings special barracks)               (Vikings stable)                                     (Vikings storage)                  (Vikings workshop)                           (Saracens barracks)           (Saracens barrelhouse)                                      (Saracens market)            (Saracens smith)                             (Saracens special barracks)          (Saracens stable)                                            (Saracens wall)               (Saracens church)                                 more....There
are 18 buildings with a different use. For example in the ""Town
Hall""you can upgrade all buildings, in the Barracks you can
train your infantry, in the Market you can exchange your
resources.... In your town u´ll find also Palace, Church, Tavern,
Smith, and more... Troops         (Vikings troops)Every
nation have a different number of troops, with different strength,
speed, hauls and so on. However, there are the special troops, which
you are choosing before start of new world. On every world you can
choose two of a many special units, which have different strenght,
attributes and different usage. Special units picked before server
usually show tactics or your role within the team. We will be
constatntly working on developing new special units, which u can buy
in game store for virtual money or for real money.                                                                              NATIONS                              Vikings                                                            Nation with powerful
army but lower economy. Vikings are usually used for offensive and
stealing tactics, defeating enemy towns etc. On the other hand, Vikings have less capacity of farm, so they can´t have huge army.  Saracens     Strong economy nation, they have great market and capacity
of troops, capacity of Stock etc. It has a fast troops, but at the
same that troops are the weakest. Anyway their power is in numbers of
army.   Crusaders                                                              Balanced nation, used usualy by the people who like
balanced economy with army. Anyway Crusaders rely on the strength of
its defense forces.          WORLD TYPES AND ABOUT CLANS               Clan                                                                      In the game portal, there is a
possibility to create your own clan, or just join an exist one.
Capacity of players is unlimited. Players are playing for clan in the Clan Worlds where is a cooperation with a clanmates necessary. They
are getting a points for clan and moving clan upper and upper in the
rank. Classic World                                                              Is a type of a world where the player is not
fixed by his clan. Every player can show his individual skill in this
world but what is more, new players (but also veterans) can meet
other people in game and form new relationships. Players are also
gaining points in global rank. In Classic world there is no clan but players can create small communities called Orders. Order is not
fixed by game portal like clan, it´s capacity is 30 playes and may
include different nations. Clan world                                                             The game starts on portal
where the clan leader create list of 10 players participating in
world. Players must represent thier clan right there. In the begining
of the world computer allots a nation to the clan so every player on
list has a same nation. Player who is playing in the clan world can´t
leave clan during this time. He must wait until the clan world ends.                                                                                                                                          World length                                                              At the begining of the game players are devided on the
map. Before the start, player can choose a part of the map where they want to play. In the clan world, clan leader devides players on the map, and choose if the players will be in the nearness, or not, in these parts of map:    1. Border with first nation2. Inland                                                                  3. Border with
second nation                                                4. Border with cities                                             There will be 12 cities = 3 Emperor´s (1 for each
nation) and 9 King´s cities (3 for each nation). Cities will be
avalaible in 15th day from the start of the world. Total world length
is about 30 days. In 25th day the ""Promised Land""become avalaible. Clan which succeed to conquer and hold it for 24 hours
will be announced as a winner of the world.After the end of the world                                                 Stats will
be saved in the profile of clan and profiles of players (possition, points and for best players we have prepaired cool badges). Points
will be devided among the players added to the global ranking.PORTAL                              Portal works as a center of a
game, you will find there for example:forum,  chat, news,
instructions... There are also ranks, world stats, clan section and much more things wich guarantee you a lot of fun.(PC version)Responsive design portal   Game website and whole game is designed responsive. You can play it on all your devices, all resolutions of screens and all screen aspect ratios.(Tablet version)                                                                                                                                      (Mobile version)Because we are students, which are
working on the game beside a school, in our free time. Any our
incomes can´t cover all of fees, which we need to run the game. We
need a lot of money to run it. Because of
that, we came here on indiegogo. We know that on this page people
helped plenty of great projects, which was given a chance to start.
So, we would be extremly happy, when you´d give that chance also to
us, and we promise, that our  game won´t dissapoint you.

Thank you.                              Absolutely in no case we don´t want to
use your money to fill our wallets. We do it for free, and we do it
with pleasure. What is more, we want to do something big and thats
our motivation.We decided that we need classic goal 3000 USD. It´s
very hard to run the game without that.   This goal we want to use for: THE SERVERS   Servers, on which will the
game run. For the quality and game fluency, we need quality servers
which aren´t cheap. With these money we want cover period when the
game will be lossy. We hope it won´t take a long time.       ADVERTISEMENT    Without an ads, it will be harder. We need to gain more players, so
another part of money will be used for advertisement.                                                                 FEES                                    Fees
connected to start of the game (fee for GBTC etc.).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               In a case that our basic goal will be funded, we have two more which aren´t so   important but we will really happy for them. It would push us much further.    Goal 8500 USD.OWN COMPANY   It´s our big dream,
because we want to have in the future an own company which creates
interesting web content, full of fun and informations. It´d push us
again forward and help us to create much better conditions for a
running game.                                                                                                                                                    If the second goal will be funded, we
have the last. We don´t believe to it a lot, but we want to give you
an information, what would happen with the money if we would recieve
more money.Goal 8500+ USD. EQUIPMENT     When we would have a
company, we would use the money for a better  technics and finally our
game would gain more quality. For example in graphic, because we
would buy new sofware etc. P.S.    Every dollar will be useful. With
every dollar we will push game at higher qualitative level.       Together,
for your satisfaction. Thank you.This screenshots are just for imagine, the game will be run firstly in english language version. And the date of open is after finnish this funding. It´s in the July 2014.The main screen of the game at Viking´s view.Not completed screen of Viking´s army.Screenshot of map only with Viking´s towns.Screen of Viking troop ""Raider"".View of the Sarancen´s town.View of the Viking´s town.View of the Crusader´s town.Thank you.",108.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Even this isn't the end, I will continue to expand and evolve the game. It's definitely not a one shot project. Everything will evolve one-by-one. That's the point where you, players, will come into play. I want to keep on listening to your voices, to criticism and pleas about what you want or don't want in the game.

Even if you have the required skills, setting up and configuring the required soft- and hardware can be a tedious process. With this project we are trying to simplify things: The RetroEngine Sigma is the device designed to make retro gaming accessible to the rest of us.  An homage to the classic systems of the nineties, our palm-size retro-style console has an ultra-powerful silicon core (four, actually) with the perfect specs to deliver one of the most kick-ass retro gaming experiences. The first time you plug it in, our installer will inject everything you need into the system to start gaming or use the Kodi Media Center Software, right away. You can even write a novel or do your taxes with it! What can I play?The Sigma will ship with 15 preinstalled, branded games that are playable out of the box. We will reveal the individual titles over the course of the campaign. In addition, our Plug’n Play installer gives you the choice to download, configure and install additional emulators from public sources and repositories, controlled by your smartphone or tablet. This is as easy as selecting the option during the initial setup of the system and will allow you to play thousands of additional ROM’s(**) that can be easily installed onto the system with a web-browser or by using the provided Micro SD adapter. Your smartphone will also be usable as a keyboard and even as an additional game controller. The following gaming systems can be enabled: Connectivity Direct connect to modern TVs via HDMI  Two front surface function buttons: User definable function.Two Player Ports accept any USB controller…...

In addition, we offer a Bluetooth dongle for the expansion port with some perks (also available individually at a later time). That means you’re good to go with most Bluetooth gamepads, for example those used with the PlayStation 3.Retro BT controllers!How long can I play?As long as you can stay awake. We ship the system with an AC Adaptor. And there is more:By adding a wireless keyboard and mouse (you can also just use your smartphone), your console becomes the perfect living room computer.

<p><strong>Real Wallachian Games</strong> proudly presents <strong>I am Vlad - Prince of Wallachia. </strong>An epic board game about the real life of Vlad the Impaler, about the habits, mysteries and actual facts from Wallachia and Transylvania.</p>
<p><em>In the year of the Lord 1456, while Wallachia and Transylvania were being haunted by bloody wars, waterways and landways were little known and very tangled; therefore, one could not travel easily and without risks and those that were able to get to one part of the world stayed there till death found them. </em></p>
<p><em>In those dark times, a large and bloody empire was rising in south Asia, which was ruled by sultans and whose only purpose was to conquer the world. This empire had crushed the eastern kingdoms and had extended its power over their capitals and over the peoples in the Balkans. </em></p>
<p><em>Many power thirsty princes had occupied the wallachian throne, the only power who was able to stop the unholy threat. One of these was different from the others - Prince Vlad Tepes (the Impaler) - who is known nowadays as ""Dracu"". To stop the endless battles, the struggles over the power and to impose against his enemies, the Prince used his merciless punishment – the famous ""impalement"", with the help of wallachian mistical creatures.</em></p>
<p>The participants must destroy hostile units, try to defeat as many neutral units as possible (werewolves, ottoman troops), thus winning gold rewards that will buy them items, magic battle cards and outpost buildings.  With the help of the methods of attack, the skills and the tacit alliances, the strategies of placing their troops and the outposts, by using daylight or being sheltered by the night, one player shall claim the throne and the Ruler of Wallachia shall be enthroned, after confronting the other claimers.</p>

<div>The <strong>I Am Vlad - Prince of Wallachia</strong> board game allows each player to control a Vlad hero as well as an Archer and a Wallachian Knight, in order to become the Ruler of Wallachia. But the path to glory and power is not easy, as each player has to face many dangers and to eliminate all his opponents trough great battles.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The hundreds of playcards, tokens, figures, outpost buildings and the astonishing map design make <strong>I Am Vlad - Prince of Wallachia</strong> the best action-roleplaying game. Below we will briefly present some of these components, features and modes of interaction between players.</div>

<div>Gameplay takes place on the <strong>Game Map</strong> and on the <strong>Underworld Map</strong>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Game Map</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong><img alt=""Main Map"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://realwallachiangames.com/games/indiegogo/main_map.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Main Map""/></strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Game Map is the board where all the interactions between players (including battles, movement and tactical positioning of units or outposts) will take place. This map has plenty of places and areas with different meanings, where players can perform actions that can and will affect their strategy and chances of winning. The most important area from the Game Map is represented by the fortress (occupied and guarded by ottomans), but players will also find churches, taverns, wild areas with dangerous werewolfes. So everyone has plenty of choices at any time: bells can be tolled, new items, cards or potions can be bought using gold coins, curses can be placed, just to name a few.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Underworld Map<br/></strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""The Underworld"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://realwallachiangames.com/games/indiegogo/underworld.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 10px;"" title=""The Underworld""/></div>
<div>The Underworld is the area where Archers and Wallachian Knights enter once they die in battle, but only if the player still has resurrection tokens. Once such a unit enters the Underworld, it must follow a path and at it's end the player can resurrect it at his own church.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On the same board with the Underworld the players will find 2 dials: Time Dial and Dial with Neutral Units' Life.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>There are 2 types of battles in <strong>I Am Vlad - Prince of Wallachia</strong>, against enemy units and against neutral units.
<p><strong>Battles between enemy units </strong>- consist in using a single Battle Card, Magic Card or Impale for each of your units involved in the battle, against the selected enemy unit (the game gives you the possibility to attack with all your 3 units, one enemy unit, if it is in their attack range). The winner will be rewarded for each enemy unit killed (1 Crown for Vlad and 3 Gold Coins for each Archer or Wallachian Knight).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""Battle between enemy units"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://realwallachiangames.com/games/indiegogo/atac_arcas.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Battle between enemy units""/></p>
<p><strong>Battles between player's units and neutral units</strong> - will take place only in the combat areas located near this neutral units. This time, you can use any number of cards for each attacking unit (they still have to respect the day/night time) until the enemy is dead. The neutral unit will respond after every card with it's own attack, shown by the 8 sided die. If the neutral unit dies in battle, you will also be rewarded with 3 Gold Coins (in case of werewolfes) or with 1 Gold Coin and 1 Flag (which will be placed on the appropriate symbol of that gate) in case of fortress guards.</p>

<div style=""text-align: center;"">© 2012 Real Wallachian Games. All rights reserved.</div></div>","Real Wallachian Games proudly presents I am Vlad - Prince of Wallachia. An epic board game about the real life of Vlad the Impaler, about the habits, mysteries and actual facts from Wallachia and Transylvania.
In the year of the Lord 1456, while Wallachia and Transylvania were being haunted by bloody wars, waterways and landways were little known and very tangled; therefore, one could not travel easily and without risks and those that were able to get to one part of the world stayed there till death found them. 
In those dark times, a large and bloody empire was rising in south Asia, which was ruled by sultans and whose only purpose was to conquer the world. This empire had crushed the eastern kingdoms and had extended its power over their capitals and over the peoples in the Balkans. 
Many power thirsty princes had occupied the wallachian throne, the only power who was able to stop the unholy threat. One of these was different from the others - Prince Vlad Tepes (the Impaler) - who is known nowadays as ""Dracu"". To stop the endless battles, the struggles over the power and to impose against his enemies, the Prince used his merciless punishment – the famous ""impalement"", with the help of wallachian mistical creatures.
The participants must destroy hostile units, try to defeat as many neutral units as possible (werewolves, ottoman troops), thus winning gold rewards that will buy them items, magic battle cards and outpost buildings.  With the help of the methods of attack, the skills and the tacit alliances, the strategies of placing their troops and the outposts, by using daylight or being sheltered by the night, one player shall claim the throne and the Ruler of Wallachia shall be enthroned, after confronting the other claimers.

 

 
Our goal is to raise $8000. Your contribution will promote this legendary board game worldwide.

But the path to glory and power is not easy, as each player has to face many dangers and to eliminate all his opponents trough great battles.
 
The hundreds of playcards, tokens, figures, outpost buildings and the astonishing map design make I Am Vlad - Prince of Wallachia the best action-roleplaying game. Below we will briefly present some of these components, features and modes of interaction between players.
 

 


 

4 highly detailed, 60 mm, Vlad the Impaler plastic miniatures


4 highly detailed, 55 mm, Wallachian Knight plastic miniatures


4 highly detailed, 62 mm, Archer plastic miniatures


4 highly detailed, 70 mm, Outpost plastic miniatures



 

 
Gameplay takes place on the Game Map and on the Underworld Map.
 
Game Map
 

 
The Game Map is the board where all the interactions between players (including battles, movement and tactical positioning of units or outposts) will take place. This map has plenty of places and areas with different meanings, where players can perform actions that can and will affect their strategy and chances of winning. The most important area from the Game Map is represented by the fortress (occupied and guarded by ottomans), but players will also find churches, taverns, wild areas with dangerous werewolfes. So everyone has plenty of choices at any time: bells can be tolled, new items, cards or potions can be bought using gold coins, curses can be placed, just to name a few.
 
Underworld Map
 

The Underworld is the area where Archers and Wallachian Knights enter once they die in battle, but only if the player still has resurrection tokens. Once such a unit enters the Underworld, it must follow a path and at it's end the player can resurrect it at his own church.
 
On the same board with the Underworld the players will find 2 dials: Time Dial and Dial with Neutral Units' Life.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
The game has 3 types of cards: Battle Cards, Magic Cards and Akathist Cards (all together are 134 cards).Battle Cards are specialised on each type of unit (Vlad, Archer or Wallachian Knight) and can be either night cards or day cards. Every unit have a different pack of battle cards:
 
Vlad the Impaler - 36 battle cards
 

 
Archer - 36 battle cards
 

 
Wallachian Knight - 36 battle cards
 

 

Magic Cards - 14 cards - can only be used with Vlad in battles and will be purchased from any tavern (using gold coins).
 

 

Akathist Cards - 12 cards - can be bought from any church and can affect one or more players (including the player who buys it) with good or bad effects for a fix period of time.
 

 
Trough all these cards, players will discover abilities, characters and creatures, weapons and armors specific Romanian territories (Wallachia and Transylvania) at that time. 

 
Different tokens can also be used to represent different actions and items like gold coins, impales, resurrections, healing potions, a church bell, a curse and so on.
 

 

 

 

 
There are 2 types of battles in I Am Vlad - Prince of Wallachia, against enemy units and against neutral units.
Battles between enemy units - consist in using a single Battle Card, Magic Card or Impale for each of your units involved in the battle, against the selected enemy unit (the game gives you the possibility to attack with all your 3 units, one enemy unit, if it is in their attack range). The winner will be rewarded for each enemy unit killed (1 Crown for Vlad and 3 Gold Coins for each Archer or Wallachian Knight).

Battles between player's units and neutral units - will take place only in the combat areas located near this neutral units. This time, you can use any number of cards for each attacking unit (they still have to respect the day/night time) until the enemy is dead. The neutral unit will respond after every card with it's own attack, shown by the 8 sided die. If the neutral unit dies in battle, you will also be rewarded with 3 Gold Coins (in case of werewolfes) or with 1 Gold Coin and 1 Flag (which will be placed on the appropriate symbol of that gate) in case of fortress guards.

<p>G<strong>reetings! Welcome to the Vales of Ithilien IndieGoGo Campaign Page!</strong></p>
<p>Allow me to introduce myself. My real name is Steve Foster. Most people know me as Timmourne Darkwater. Timmourne is a fictional character I have been playing in various Live Action Role Playing Games for 20+ years.</p>
<p>I am using this crowd funding platform to build my dream campsite in Pennsylvania. Take a moment to hear what I envision.</p>
<p>I would like to construct, run, and maintain a campsite tailored specifically to Fantasy and Medieval style campers, reenactors, foam combat groups, LARPs, SCAdians, Rennies, etc! A place where we can all go and enjoy the site without all of the mundane distractions so common to campsites these days!</p>
<p>That is the basic gist of things. If I have your attention and you would like to know more, please continue reading as I go into more detail.</p>
<p>W<strong>hat I am Trying to Create</strong></p>
<p>I have been involved in Gaming since I was very young. I have always enjoyed Fantasy and Medieval settings the most. I have been involved with Foam Combat games for 20+ years now. My oldest child now takes the field as well. We have developed a passion for these games and want everyone to have a place to enjoy them.</p>
<p>I want to build a campsite that is very friendly to all forms of Live Action Gaming. A place where we can gather and battle without worrying about mundane intrusions into our temporary fantasy worlds. A place for LARPers to fully immerse themselves into their characters and not worry about the locals walking around the campsite drinking beer in t-shirts. A place where SCAdians can camp in period tents and not be next to a trailer. A place to hold a Ren Faire one week, then Boffer events the next. A place where Realms and Chapters can host large meetings and councils in a room not used for Bingo that same week. A place for the local SCA chapter to hold demos and practices and not be hidden behind a school or shopping mall.</p>
<p>I plan on building a site that incorporates the best of both worlds. Modern ammenities hidden behind a beautiful facade of realistic looking fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>Why I am the one to do this</strong></p>
<p>I am the owner of Foster Property Management, LLC in the mundane world. I renovate and run rental properties in the Greater Johstown PA area. I have a ton of experience in running a business, renovating old delapitated buildings, managing properties, maintaining grounds, and dealing with groups of diverse people. After nearly 10 years getting that business flowing smoothly, I decided to persue my dreams.</p>
<p>I have a varied realtionship with many different groups that can benefit from a site like this. I am a unit leader in Dagorhir (The Rangers of Ithilien), I am a Realm Admin for Maethodoron (Dagorhir Chapter), a am a Leathersmith (Darkwater Arms and Armor), I am the current manager of Britannia Faire (a medieval style campsite in Ohio), I am an avid volunteer for all the games and societies I get involved with (Medic, Herald, Feast Prep), and I am a camper myself.</p>
<p>I have been going to different campsites all over the country for the last 20+ years, and there are always things that bother me. The biggest being the mundane population standing around gawking. The second would have to be that many events are now hosted a RV/Trailer campsites. I personally would like to get back to the way I remember the first events, much more primitive camping without cars/RVs/Trailers/Mundanes everywhere. But I have to admit that as I get older, having running water, flushing toilets, and a shower is very nice to have around!</p>
<p><strong>What this Campaign is supposed to achieve</strong></p>
<p>This initial Funding project is to acquire the location and the basic supplies to get started. I would love to do this on my own, but unfortunately, life has thrown me some curves and I am looking for people to help me achieve this dream. If we can raise enough to acquire a suitable location, things begin to develop quickly after that. I have the energy and desire to build this wonderful property. The funding will provide the capital to purchase a suitable site, install basic infrastructure for our comfort, and get the ball rolling!</p>
<p>Having enough land to satisfy the needs of the site, being close enough to major highways and decent sized towns to satisfy campers needs, and geographically centering between larger populations of demographics are the biggest concerns I have faced. Having researched the Real Estate market in my immediate area, I have found several locations that will suit the purpose quite well.</p>
<p><strong>I am currently exploring three indivdual sites:</strong></p>
<p>Site 1 - Cambria County PA - Near Ebensburg - 100+ acres of an old Christmas tree farm. The site sits right off of a major highway with easy access to town. There is a Walmart 10 minutes away, as well as grocery stores and all the things modern people need. There is already Electric service to the site. The site is mostly flat, but is also partially wooded.</p>
<p>Site 2 - Fulton County PA - Near the MD border off of route 70. Site is 100+ acres and full wooded at this time. Terrain requires a bit more work, but is closer to the Metro areas of DC/Baltimore.

Welcome to the Vales of Ithilien IndieGoGo Campaign Page!
Allow me to introduce myself. My real name is Steve Foster. Most people know me as Timmourne Darkwater. Timmourne is a fictional character I have been playing in various Live Action Role Playing Games for 20+ years.
I am using this crowd funding platform to build my dream campsite in Pennsylvania. Take a moment to hear what I envision.
I would like to construct, run, and maintain a campsite tailored specifically to Fantasy and Medieval style campers, reenactors, foam combat groups, LARPs, SCAdians, Rennies, etc! A place where we can all go and enjoy the site without all of the mundane distractions so common to campsites these days!
That is the basic gist of things. If I have your attention and you would like to know more, please continue reading as I go into more detail.
What I am Trying to Create
I have been involved in Gaming since I was very young. I have always enjoyed Fantasy and Medieval settings the most. I have been involved with Foam Combat games for 20+ years now. My oldest child now takes the field as well. We have developed a passion for these games and want everyone to have a place to enjoy them.
I want to build a campsite that is very friendly to all forms of Live Action Gaming. A place where we can gather and battle without worrying about mundane intrusions into our temporary fantasy worlds. A place for LARPers to fully immerse themselves into their characters and not worry about the locals walking around the campsite drinking beer in t-shirts. A place where SCAdians can camp in period tents and not be next to a trailer. A place to hold a Ren Faire one week, then Boffer events the next. A place where Realms and Chapters can host large meetings and councils in a room not used for Bingo that same week. A place for the local SCA chapter to hold demos and practices and not be hidden behind a school or shopping mall.
I plan on building a site that incorporates the best of both worlds. Modern ammenities hidden behind a beautiful facade of realistic looking fantasy.
Why I am the one to do this
I am the owner of Foster Property Management, LLC in the mundane world. I renovate and run rental properties in the Greater Johstown PA area. I have a ton of experience in running a business, renovating old delapitated buildings, managing properties, maintaining grounds, and dealing with groups of diverse people. After nearly 10 years getting that business flowing smoothly, I decided to persue my dreams.
I have a varied realtionship with many different groups that can benefit from a site like this. I am a unit leader in Dagorhir (The Rangers of Ithilien), I am a Realm Admin for Maethodoron (Dagorhir Chapter), a am a Leathersmith (Darkwater Arms and Armor), I am the current manager of Britannia Faire (a medieval style campsite in Ohio), I am an avid volunteer for all the games and societies I get involved with (Medic, Herald, Feast Prep), and I am a camper myself.
I have been going to different campsites all over the country for the last 20+ years, and there are always things that bother me. The biggest being the mundane population standing around gawking. The second would have to be that many events are now hosted a RV/Trailer campsites. I personally would like to get back to the way I remember the first events, much more primitive camping without cars/RVs/Trailers/Mundanes everywhere. But I have to admit that as I get older, having running water, flushing toilets, and a shower is very nice to have around!
What this Campaign is supposed to achieve
This initial Funding project is to acquire the location and the basic supplies to get started. I would love to do this on my own, but unfortunately, life has thrown me some curves and I am looking for people to help me achieve this dream. If we can raise enough to acquire a suitable location, things begin to develop quickly after that. I have the energy and desire to build this wonderful property. The funding will provide the capital to purchase a suitable site, install basic infrastructure for our comfort, and get the ball rolling!
Having enough land to satisfy the needs of the site, being close enough to major highways and decent sized towns to satisfy campers needs, and geographically centering between larger populations of demographics are the biggest concerns I have faced. Having researched the Real Estate market in my immediate area, I have found several locations that will suit the purpose quite well.
I am currently exploring three indivdual sites:
Site 1 - Cambria County PA - Near Ebensburg - 100+ acres of an old Christmas tree farm. The site sits right off of a major highway with easy access to town. There is a Walmart 10 minutes away, as well as grocery stores and all the things modern people need. There is already Electric service to the site. The site is mostly flat, but is also partially wooded.
Site 2 - Fulton County PA - Near the MD border off of route 70. Site is 100+ acres and full wooded at this time. Terrain requires a bit more work, but is closer to the Metro areas of DC/Baltimore. This site is a bit removed from a major town with a Walmart etc. Site has yet to be perked for water/septic and has no power at this time.
Site 3 - Bedford County PA - 53 Acres of undeveloped land 20 minutes south of Bedford PA. This site was recommended by a local real estate agent and has not been site surveyed at all. The pics the agent provided are promising though and I will check it out later this week.
Site #1 is my preferred site, but much will depend on the timing and market upon completion of funding campaigns. Site #1 is also much closer to my family residence as well as local companies I will need to utilize for construction.
The scope of the fundraising is daunting to say the least!
The intial invesment of funds will go towards acquiring the land itself, building basic infrastructure, and getting the site to a state it can be easily utilized by many different groups. I will use the funds to get the property going, then I will use my own funds and financing to continue the operastions. I have excellent contacts with a local bank in the region that is willing to help so long as a basic beginning level is achieved.
Site maintenance will be handled by myself and my family year round. As much as I appreciate volunteers and the amazing work they can do, I cannot rely on them to keep a project of this magnitude running. I have formed some close relationships with contractors, builders, and tradesmen over the years in my property management business and will draw on their companies to do what is needed in a quick professional manner.
Once we are up and running, the major sources of income to maintain the site feasibility is the ""Per Head"" fee charged for camping, Camp Store Sales, and facility rental for special buildings and events. I have always liked the idea and practice of a ""Pay per Attendance"" model to allow the smaller organizations to utilize some of the same perks as the bigger groups.
Being directly involved with the site also allows me special time and energy to deal with specific desires of each individual organization. I know groups like the SCA need completely different things than a Vampire LARP, and I can tailor to each in kind.

<p>Flirt Planet is a ground-breaking new social dating video game where you can learn valuable socializing skills that will genuinely help you when it comes to interacting and dating in the <strong>real world</strong>.  It is truly a ""Social Game"" as opposed to a mere ""Social Network Game"".  It is the first game ever created with an aim to improve real world relationships.  We bridge two industries -- online dating and video games -- and provide valuable social skills for players so you can become better at forming meaningful relationships.  The Test Version of the game is <a href=""http://bit.ly/WXA1nx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Flirt Planet Test Version"">live now on Facebook</a> and will soon be available on iPhones, Androids, iPads and other tablets.  </p>
<p>Together with video game veteran Brian Colin of Game Refuge we’re developing Flirt Planet for you.  It's a game for people.  For people who want to be more social.  </p>

<p>Simply log on through Facebook Connect, build your very own avatar, then create and maintain relationships with other player-created Avatars and Artificial Intelligence computer-controlled characters.  These interactions can take place in multiple forms -- both via text and also through digitally animated body language.  In Flirt Planet, with your avatar, you interact with others who you find attractive, and learn how to better flirt and date within the game environment.</p>
<p>In addition, you can introduce compatible friends, take online crushes on virtual dates, and practice dating and flirting skills in these scenarios.  The skills you acquire in Flirt Planet serve as your foundations for building meaningful relationships in the real world.  So Flirt Planet is not only fun and engaging, it also has real value.</p>

<p>We're free-to-play.  We believe trying out something new should be free.  We believe meeting new people should be free.  We believe you should be able to play a good game from start to finish for free.  And, in order to deserve your praise, we believe that it is our job to engage and surprise you with immersive game experiences staged by our premium content.  It is more difficult to be successful in a free-to-play environment than in the traditional retail one.  But, let’s be frank, free-to-play is now a necessity, especially for smartphones and tablets.  And Facebook games have always been free-to-play.  But we need to break away from the negative perception of the current monetization practices of some free-to-play games.  So, in Flirt Planet we won’t push you to ""feed your chicken"" late at night, nor will we force you to invite your friends in order to progress.  We strive to motivate and reward you fairly.</p>

<p>Flirt Planet is more than just a video game:  it is a community created for those of you who want to make a difference in the world.  In Flirt Planet, you can contribute to solving real world problems.  You can donate directly to important causes and foundations, recommend causes to other players, and publicly support those causes that are most important to you.  We will have a donations channel from you (the player) to celebrities’ foundations, via the Celebrity Charity Auction. </p>

<p>We started developing Flirt Planet on Unity 3D in October 2011 and are now ready to unveil the game.  With our industry veteran, Brian Colin (Game Refuge Inc.), we designed and built a deeply immersive game.  Our highly talented and admirable 30-person team, based in Downers Grove, IL has developed the highly elaborate 3D environments, über cute avatars, a massive clothing and accessories store and written over 80,000 lines of dialogue. </p>
<p><span>At TrulySocial we believe in ongoing recruitment of talented individuals. So, if through this crowdfunding campaign we spot someone who impresses us by collaborating with us in game design or development, we may consider him or her for future vacancies.</span></p>

<p>Because you -- the crowd -- have a voice, Flirt Planet will be a lot better for you -- the players.  We can start listening to you early on and involve you directly in the development of the new features we have lined up for you.  </p>
<p>The additional funding allows us to maintain a higher level of ongoing development in the game, than we would be able to have if we were to wait for momentum to build after release. </p>
<p>It takes research and prototyping time to develop good game dynamics.  With Unity we have the right technology, our team has the right talent and most importantly, we have faith. Nonetheless, we need the big bucks to take Flirt Planet to the Next Level and self-publish. </p>

<p>Our dating service will offer you an amazing user experience for FREE!</p>
<p>The Dating Service we designed is utterly unique and highly effective, as there's real science behind the match-making.  Our Matching Sauce is a holistic approach to compatibility, so that you can choose how you want to find your matches.  We are ready to challenge the services offered by rivals Match.com, OKCupid and eHarmony.</p>
<p>You may use your game avatars and communicate anonymously, and only give out your direct contact details when you feel comfortable using your real identity.  You play with a screen name, and have the option of only using your avatar pic in the dating area.  You may send and receive Flirt Mail for free through SMS and email via your favorite devices, without disclosing personal contact details to your Flirt Planet connections.</p>
<p>Flirt Planet is well-controlled for appropriate playing and dating activities.  The game is open to players 13+.  However, 13-17 year olds may only play the ""core game.”  Players 18+ may play the game and also have access to the dating service. Here, you get to communicate with one another only once consent is established between the two users, so you won't get spammed or swamped with unwanted messages.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>2. YOUR VIRTUAL BOYFRIEND &amp; GIRLFRIEND</strong></h3>
<p>You get a virtual character attracted to you, exchange details, take him or her on online dates, and even take it further.  You will be able to interact and practice flirting and dating within our environment, with absolutely zero pressure and zero risks.  You will have to remember birthdays, send gifts, respond to messages, deal with mood swings and the unpredictable.  There will be make ups and break ups.  We want you to be prepared for anything!</p>
<p>All of this content heavily relies on the creative writing skills of our scriptwriters.  We want to be able to keep coming up with fresh and amazing story lines for our ""conversational engine"" and add to our vast repertoire of dialogues. </p>

<p><strong>Hi there!  It’s Seb again.  </strong></p>
<p>Before you decide whether this project is for you, there’s something else I wanted to mention to you:  why Flirt Planet?  How did this start?</p>
<p>Well, I convinced the team to make this video game with me because I fell in love with a story.  The story concerned a group of socially awkward men, many of whom had been rejected as unfit for social events.  Underdogs really.  Who, nonetheless, had turned themselves into one of the most alluring and desirable group of bachelors.  How did they do it?  What was their secret?  Well, they called it ""Game"".<br/><br/> But the idea for Flirt Planet came well before I had a good reason to make it -- before I had a story to fall in love with.  It began, really, with an innocent question:  why is it that our presence in the digital world can obstruct the creation of new relationships in the physical world, or even ruin our existing relationships?  Also, the gap between the skilled and the unskilled in social contexts was far greater than I imagined, and widening rapidly, as we started living out more and more of our lives in the online world.  Just think about the silent ""hang outs"" we have and how much time we spend locked into our phones while we're in fact meant to be talking with the friends in our presence.<br/><br/><strong>Why am I telling you this?</strong></p>
<p>Because, while Flirt Planet is a fun game it also is an attempt to reverse this unsocial trend, and help us put the human back into socializing.  You know, help us get out there and make relationships for real! <br/><br/></p>
<p><img alt=""Lets Be"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1290.photobucket.com/albums/b525/Seb_Coman/LetsBe_zps6027e832.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Lets Be""/> </p>
<p>I have been passionate about designing video games since an early age.  When I recently realized the need for a social dating video game, I transformed my life-long passion into a full-time mission to help millions of people acquire social skills for free (in a virtual environment) that you may apply in your real life relationships.</p>
<p>So, with this, I invite you to become part of our journey and make a lasting impact!  There is a clear need for casual games to become more personal and less “formulaic”.  Similarly, there is a clear need for online dating sites to help you improve your social skills, rather than just giving you list of strangers to filter through.  Our goal is to change the landscape by being creative!</p>
<p>With your contributions we will introduce a good measure of creativity into casual games and online dating.  From our roots will we grow the second generation of casual games, because we are all about value for the player.  Be part of the shift!  Only action changes the world.  Take action.  It's not for me...  do it for you.  Do it for all of us!</p>

<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Q: What do the Aliens have to do with all of this?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Great question!  Here is the storyline:</p>
<p>You assume the role of one of a trio of Aliens from another world who have come to Earth to harness and harvest the most sought-after force in the universe: …the powerful, positive Energy that is generated by a Living Organism’s Volatile Emotions (aka “LOVE”).</p>
<p>Then, you are cast in the role of an outsider to Human culture who must learn to effectively engage, socialize, and interact with Humans in a manner that forms strong interpersonal relationships, since it is your goal to harvest as much of this valuable, positive Energy as possible.</p>
<p>To begin, we interactively depict your comical transformation from a “little green man” into a human male or female.  The Avatar creation process allows us to learn about your preferences in a funny, hands-on, non-threatening way, and sets up the rest of the game in a way that would let us present insights into the human condition in an entertaining manner.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What platforms will Flirt Planet be on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> It will be on iPhones, iPads, Android phones, tablets and social networks.  Our Test Version is live now on our <a href=""http://bit.ly/WXA1nx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Flirt Planet App"">Facebook App</a>.</p>
<p>Soon, we will be able to port Flirt Planet to tablets, on both iOS and Android. We will do that anyway once we have our polished version ready for porting. Estimate: June 2012.  For phones we'll need to develop a shrunken down version of the game and the fully functional dating service first.  We can then port that to your phones also. Our stretch goal for “Mobile Version” will cover the resources needed to do this. Estimate: June/July 2012. </p>
<p><strong> Q: Will I be able to date people on here?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Yes!  Once we've completed the dating service Flirt Planet will be the world's first social dating game. <strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> Q: What happens if you go over the funding goal?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>That's great news, as we'll be able to start funding the ""Stretch Goals""!<strong><br/><br/> Q: How will sizing work for the t-shirts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>If your perk includes a merchandise pack then please ensure that you indicate your style (womens or mens) and your size (S/M/L/XL) in shipping information/additional info when making your contribution.<strong><br/><br/> Q: What if I forgot to contribute the additional $15 for international shipping?</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>A: </strong></strong>As an international funder of perks between $70 and $325 you can settle the $15 with us via paypal.  Please contact: press@flirtplanet3d.com</p></div>","Do you want social interactions to become more meaningful?  Yes?!  Then, let’s do something about it ...
Social networking environments, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, help you become more “connected” online.  But, many of these countless connections are not meaningful, right?  Flirt Planet is an innovative gaming solution to the modern day dilemma of countless online connections, but few real life bonds.  Our game genuinely helps you form fruitful bonds in the real world.

But wait, what are ""H.U.G.S.""?  (we'll reveal at the end...)
 
Do you want casual games and online dating sites to change for the better?   Yes?!  Then, read on ...
We are an independent games studio.  We are not taking money from publishers because we don’t want publishers to mess with our game.  Flirt Planet will be a lot better for players because of the crowdfunding.  In the next few months, we'll be able to release a LOT more features.  Now, we invite YOU to get involved and help us decide!
While the big games studios argue over copyrights and free-to-play, or not, we're getting things done.  We keep it simple: we will make great new and fun games that the fans want!  No publishers.  We are just an independent studio in direct contact with the fans.  That's how it should be!

Do you want to be part of the shift and revolutionize the games and online dating industries?  Yes?!  Then, Join Our Tribe!

 

Flirt Planet is a ground-breaking new social dating video game where you can learn valuable socializing skills that will genuinely help you when it comes to interacting and dating in the real world.  It is truly a ""Social Game"" as opposed to a mere ""Social Network Game"".  It is the first game ever created with an aim to improve real world relationships.  We bridge two industries -- online dating and video games -- and provide valuable social skills for players so you can become better at forming meaningful relationships.  The Test Version of the game is live now on Facebook and will soon be available on iPhones, Androids, iPads and other tablets.  
Together with video game veteran Brian Colin of Game Refuge we’re developing Flirt Planet for you.  It's a game for people.  For people who want to be more social.  

Simply log on through Facebook Connect, build your very own avatar, then create and maintain relationships with other player-created Avatars and Artificial Intelligence computer-controlled characters.  These interactions can take place in multiple forms -- both via text and also through digitally animated body language.  In Flirt Planet, with your avatar, you interact with others who you find attractive, and learn how to better flirt and date within the game environment.
In addition, you can introduce compatible friends, take online crushes on virtual dates, and practice dating and flirting skills in these scenarios.  The skills you acquire in Flirt Planet serve as your foundations for building meaningful relationships in the real world.  So Flirt Planet is not only fun and engaging, it also has real value.
 

We're free-to-play.  We believe trying out something new should be free.  We believe meeting new people should be free.  We believe you should be able to play a good game from start to finish for free.  And, in order to deserve your praise, we believe that it is our job to engage and surprise you with immersive game experiences staged by our premium content.  It is more difficult to be successful in a free-to-play environment than in the traditional retail one.  But, let’s be frank, free-to-play is now a necessity, especially for smartphones and tablets.  And Facebook games have always been free-to-play.  But we need to break away from the negative perception of the current monetization practices of some free-to-play games.  So, in Flirt Planet we won’t push you to ""feed your chicken"" late at night, nor will we force you to invite your friends in order to progress.  We strive to motivate and reward you fairly.
 

Flirt Planet is more than just a video game:  it is a community created for those of you who want to make a difference in the world.  In Flirt Planet, you can contribute to solving real world problems.  You can donate directly to important causes and foundations, recommend causes to other players, and publicly support those causes that are most important to you.  We will have a donations channel from you (the player) to celebrities’ foundations, via the Celebrity Charity Auction. 
We've already started developing characters to date via the Celebrity Charity Auction, such as this little fella: 

 

We started developing Flirt Planet on Unity 3D in October 2011 and are now ready to unveil the game.  With our industry veteran, Brian Colin (Game Refuge Inc.), we designed and built a deeply immersive game.  Our highly talented and admirable 30-person team, based in Downers Grove, IL has developed the highly elaborate 3D environments, über cute avatars, a massive clothing and accessories store and written over 80,000 lines of dialogue. 
At TrulySocial we believe in ongoing recruitment of talented individuals. So, if through this crowdfunding campaign we spot someone who impresses us by collaborating with us in game design or development, we may consider him or her for future vacancies.
Here is a little peak into the Behind the Scenes at the Flirt Planet Development Studio:

 

Because you -- the crowd -- have a voice, Flirt Planet will be a lot better for you -- the players.  We can start listening to you early on and involve you directly in the development of the new features we have lined up for you.  
The additional funding allows us to maintain a higher level of ongoing development in the game, than we would be able to have if we were to wait for momentum to build after release. 
It takes research and prototyping time to develop good game dynamics.  With Unity we have the right technology, our team has the right talent and most importantly, we have faith. Nonetheless, we need the big bucks to take Flirt Planet to the Next Level and self-publish. 
Here is how we have mapped out Our Journey: 


The best part of our campaign is:  we have already built a working game, so with us, you're not risking that we won't end up developing it.  Plus, we'll be able to deliver your perks soon after the campaign closes.  With us you don't have to wait a year until we've made the game!  It's live now on Facebook, so go play test it and let us know what you think! 
 

1. A STATE-OF-THE-ART DATING SERVICE FOR YOU
Our dating service will offer you an amazing user experience for FREE!
The Dating Service we designed is utterly unique and highly effective, as there's real science behind the match-making.  Our Matching Sauce is a holistic approach to compatibility, so that you can choose how you want to find your matches.  We are ready to challenge the services offered by rivals Match.com, OKCupid and eHarmony.
You may use your game avatars and communicate anonymously, and only give out your direct contact details when you feel comfortable using your real identity.  You play with a screen name, and have the option of only using your avatar pic in the dating area.  You may send and receive Flirt Mail for free through SMS and email via your favorite devices, without disclosing personal contact details to your Flirt Planet connections.
Flirt Planet is well-controlled for appropriate playing and dating activities.  The game is open to players 13+.  However, 13-17 year olds may only play the ""core game.”  Players 18+ may play the game and also have access to the dating service. Here, you get to communicate with one another only once consent is established between the two users, so you won't get spammed or swamped with unwanted messages.
 
2. YOUR VIRTUAL BOYFRIEND & GIRLFRIEND
You get a virtual character attracted to you, exchange details, take him or her on online dates, and even take it further.  You will be able to interact and practice flirting and dating within our environment, with absolutely zero pressure and zero risks.  You will have to remember birthdays, send gifts, respond to messages, deal with mood swings and the unpredictable.  There will be make ups and break ups.  We want you to be prepared for anything!
All of this content heavily relies on the creative writing skills of our scriptwriters.  We want to be able to keep coming up with fresh and amazing story lines for our ""conversational engine"" and add to our vast repertoire of dialogues. 
 

Let's be realistic, our low funding goal is only a drop in the ocean.  It costs significantly more to take Flirt Planet to the Next Level.  So, if / once we exceed our target funding goal here are the Stretch Goals we are looking to fund with your contributions.  Note that these are not mere ideas.  We've started design and even development on some of them! 
STRETCH GOALS


Gifting among players:  share, trade and collect fun and whacky themed gifts with one another.

Mobile Version:  game design tweaked for mobile phones. We need to build an App so that you can play on-the-go.  We re-design some features so that it fits on the small screen.  It will have the full dating service.

The VIP Dating Club:  it will be a premium invite-only area for engaged users of the Dating Service.  Its membership fee keeps out “window shoppers”.

Celebrity Charity Auction:  we will make a Social Impact.  With your help and that of celebrities we can donate to charitable causes directly and at scale.  You bid for virtual dates with celebrity characters, your bid goes to charity and you enter prize draws.

More Exotic Travel Locations:  you can use the travel agent to reach far away destinations and go on exotic dates!

Ultimate Cars:  the best way to get noticed!  We add ultimate cars to our standard collection with decals and bling for you to customize your own cars.  An ideal date location!

Worldwide Connectivity:  a full cross-platform, all-devices, multi-national game experience with players from all over the world! You will be able to interact with many more and more diverse players and meet them in real life via the dating service.

FAQ
Q: What do the Aliens have to do with all of this?
A: Great question!  Here is the storyline:
You assume the role of one of a trio of Aliens from another world who have come to Earth to harness and harvest the most sought-after force in the universe: …the powerful, positive Energy that is generated by a Living Organism’s Volatile Emotions (aka “LOVE”).
Then, you are cast in the role of an outsider to Human culture who must learn to effectively engage, socialize, and interact with Humans in a manner that forms strong interpersonal relationships, since it is your goal to harvest as much of this valuable, positive Energy as possible.
To begin, we interactively depict your comical transformation from a “little green man” into a human male or female.  The Avatar creation process allows us to learn about your preferences in a funny, hands-on, non-threatening way, and sets up the rest of the game in a way that would let us present insights into the human condition in an entertaining manner.
Q: What platforms will Flirt Planet be on?

<p>Karacore ApS is the small company behind Oxron (<a href=""http://www.oxron.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.oxron.com</a>). The company is located in Denmark and was founded and funded by two friends Kasper Holm and Rasmus Nielsen. Kasper Holm is the game developer (which includes practically all aspects of the game). The game graphics have been designed by the talented artist and freelancer Rasmus Jensen and several people have volunteered to help out over time. Usually in exchange for similar rewards as the perks listed here (not quite alike, as these are unique to this campaign). See <a href=""http://www.karacore.dk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.karacore.dk</a></p>
<p>The game is developed in ASP.NET (C# and MSSQL) and works on virtually every platform as long as there is a browser available. The game is designed for a browser window on normal PCs. Mobile play is possible, though zooming is often needed on smaller screens. Tablet play works quite ok.</p>
<p>The game is being developed in the spare time as all people involved have other jobs to attend to on a daily basis.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why funding?</strong></h2>
<p>Oxron is funded by the two founders of the company behind the game. All money has been taken out of personal savings. So far the game has gotten good feedback and a lot of players have actually played the beta, server 1 and server 2. The problem is that this has gotten a bit too expensive to continue on the same path as not enough players have been joining up. Some income is coming in, but not enough to support continuing development. </p>
<p>So funding is basically needed to improve the awareness of the game. Oxron is a good game according to a lot of the previous players of the game and there are a major group of players enjoying these types of games.</p>
<p>Now, the problem is this: They don’t know about Oxron… yet =) </p>
<p>With the previous servers some funding has been put into advertising and public awareness. The strategy for making new servers wasn’t too good though, creating stale periods where there wasn’t any sense in joining a well-developed server or the game was completely on a hold due to improvements. </p>
<p>The strategy is to have the funds support a plan where new servers start with 2-3 months intervals and improvements to the game happens on new servers, while the old ones still run and of course receive bug updates. This should help slain players give it another go or friends of players trying it out on a server, where they won’t be 3-4 months behind from the start. </p>
<p>This strategy requires more funding for advertising and promotion as new servers must be filled within 2-3 months’ time. With time, enough players should start playing and a reasonable income should be possible to fund the next servers starting.</p>
<p>If it all goes well, some improvements might need to be considered on the hardware front, but of course this a problem that would be received with arms wide open ;-) </p>
<p>Oxron is not a bug filled game. It has had its beta and two server rounds of approximately 170 days each and it is working really well. With the upcoming server 3, dungeons and glory points are introduced, making the game even better. Please help introduce this game to a wider audience and let it show it has some punch even compared to the big budget games in the genre.</p>

<h2><strong>Perks - how they work</strong></h2>
<p>--- <strong>Update 30. april:</strong> All titles and achievements will work on all future servers and are no longer bound to a certain number of uses --- </p>
<p>When donating, you’ll receive so called coupon codes by mail. These can be redeemed once you have entered the game.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>Idea behind the game</strong></h2>
<p>The main idea is to create a balanced strategy game with a gameplay that is better than the current games in the same genre and to constantly improve it to give it a unique feel when playing. This is often not done enough, even though some games get a bigger audience. Lack of improvement to other games really triggered the start to Oxron with a wish to create a good game and constantly improve it. </p>
<p>Inspiration for the game comes from a wide array of games ranging from Civilization, WoW, Settlers to the browser based ones like Greepolis, Travian and so on. </p>
<p>Competing with the graphics and audio of large game companies is near impossible though, but nice wrapping doesn’t always contain games you get hooked on and keep playing. Good gameplay comes with good content and especially with strategy games; you want to have lots of options in the game that makes sense. </p>
<p>Oxron is meant to have different ways to improve in the game. There must never be just one or two ways to do things in order to become a strong and influential player. This is constantly being taken into consideration when adding new content to the game. </p>
<p>In a time where new games (especially via Facebook) have made some gamers lose their will to fight so to speak and only play easy games, where they “can’t go wrong” or loose and often only do lots of repetitive tasks without much consideration, Oxron is a game that does require an effort and does require some thinking. Taking just a little time to get to know the game, should quickly reveal a gameplay that is easy, but a game where the choices are hard. You can’t have it all, so what to choose and when. </p>
<p>Making money on the game… Free-to-play is the only model that works if you want a wider audience. Lots of good games exist using this model, but there is a big difference how it is implemented. The Chinese way, where you can pay-to-win is not and will never be an option with Oxron. Instead you should be able to do well without paying a single $ or €. </p>
<p>Then why pay anything? Well, most of the advantages ease out the gameplay making you do more without being at the computer so much and having an improved interface. To many people these features will be handy and useful. You can see them at <a href=""http://help.oxron.com/moonstones.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://help.oxron.com/moonstones.aspx</a>. </p>
<p>Everyone gets to try out the features in the game for free, so there is no secret to them. There will of course always be some other small advantages to paying as well, but focus is on to not let it be huge strategic advantages. I.e. You can never pay to have a higher resource income or to create troops instantaneously.</p>
<p>All in all the philosophy of the game is to have a well-balanced strategy game, which is constantly improved and to give people a game that makes sense and not making it into a “we’re all winners” game. Yes, you can actually loose and be knocked back to the starting point even way before the end game starts, if you don’t get your defense up and running ;-)</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>In short, what is Oxron?</strong></h2>
<p>Oxron is a real-time browser based real-time strategy game, which runs in practically any modern browser. It falls in the category of text-based games, which means it is a normal webpage consisting of text and images. See official site <a href=""http://www.oxron.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.oxron.com</a> as well. </p>
<p>The game is never on a break and every account can be affected, even if users are not logged into the game. </p>
<p>The story goes that an unknown disaster has devastated the land Akronia and ruined almost everything. As one of the survivors, you (as a player) are put in charge of rebuilding your town and eventually your own kingdom so to speak.</p>
<p>In time, you will expand and found more towns (some turn to even larger cities), research new things to improve, train troops, forge alliances, wage war against both NPC and human controlled areas and eventually battle for control of the devastating weapon, Oxron. </p>
<p>Building, researching, training of troops etc. will finish over a period of time and thus making this a real-time strategy game. </p>
<p>What sets this game apart from Travian, Grepolis, Evony etc. in our opinion, is the great amount of strategy elements in the game. There is not one correct way to do things and the game is constantly being balanced to keep it that way. The development also focusses on player feedback and makes an effort to constantly improve the game to the players’ liking. </p>
<p>The multiplayer part is letting people join up in clans, who can be ruled as a dictatorship, council rule or full-fledged democracy. Oxron has a well working forum for players and clans and in-game clan chat, which makes you feel you’re part of multiplayer game. Players and clans are automatically created in the forum at signup and creation. </p>
<p>The game gets its income from in-game purchases of moonstones. These moonstones won’t provide players with huge strategic advantages over those not paying to play. They merely make the gameplay easier with lots of really nice features, once you get used to them. </p>
<p>You can’t pay to be number one, but you can pay to make things less time consuming for yourself basically. These are important and are always important criterions, when adding new features to the various package advantages in-game. See them here: <a href=""http://help.oxron.com/moonstones.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://help.oxron.com/moonstones.aspx</a>. </p>
<p>The game runs for several months (typically 5-7, but can be longer) per server and finishes off with an endgame that is won by a single clan. Usually this endgame is quite a thrill to be a part of and a nice finish to a game that you’ve been a part of for some time. It can best be described as a domination game, where each clan needs to hold as many Oxron towers in the world over a period of time in order to win. </p>

Karacore ApS is the small company behind Oxron (www.oxron.com). The company is located in Denmark and was founded and funded by two friends Kasper Holm and Rasmus Nielsen. Kasper Holm is the game developer (which includes practically all aspects of the game). The game graphics have been designed by the talented artist and freelancer Rasmus Jensen and several people have volunteered to help out over time. Usually in exchange for similar rewards as the perks listed here (not quite alike, as these are unique to this campaign). See www.karacore.dk
The game is developed in ASP.NET (C# and MSSQL) and works on virtually every platform as long as there is a browser available. The game is designed for a browser window on normal PCs. Mobile play is possible, though zooming is often needed on smaller screens. Tablet play works quite ok.
The game is being developed in the spare time as all people involved have other jobs to attend to on a daily basis.
 
Why funding?
Oxron is funded by the two founders of the company behind the game. All money has been taken out of personal savings. So far the game has gotten good feedback and a lot of players have actually played the beta, server 1 and server 2. The problem is that this has gotten a bit too expensive to continue on the same path as not enough players have been joining up. Some income is coming in, but not enough to support continuing development. 
So funding is basically needed to improve the awareness of the game. Oxron is a good game according to a lot of the previous players of the game and there are a major group of players enjoying these types of games.
Now, the problem is this: They don’t know about Oxron… yet =) 
With the previous servers some funding has been put into advertising and public awareness. The strategy for making new servers wasn’t too good though, creating stale periods where there wasn’t any sense in joining a well-developed server or the game was completely on a hold due to improvements. 
The strategy is to have the funds support a plan where new servers start with 2-3 months intervals and improvements to the game happens on new servers, while the old ones still run and of course receive bug updates. This should help slain players give it another go or friends of players trying it out on a server, where they won’t be 3-4 months behind from the start. 
This strategy requires more funding for advertising and promotion as new servers must be filled within 2-3 months’ time. With time, enough players should start playing and a reasonable income should be possible to fund the next servers starting.
If it all goes well, some improvements might need to be considered on the hardware front, but of course this a problem that would be received with arms wide open ;-) 
Oxron is not a bug filled game. It has had its beta and two server rounds of approximately 170 days each and it is working really well. With the upcoming server 3, dungeons and glory points are introduced, making the game even better. Please help introduce this game to a wider audience and let it show it has some punch even compared to the big budget games in the genre.

</h2>
<div>Hello. I am Trent Gamblin, Founder of Nooskewl in Canmore, Alberta. We are the developers of several games. One of those games is Monster RPG 2. In 2012, we had an Indiegogo campaign to open source Monster RPG 2 and it was successful. You can currently download the source code from <a href=""http://www.nooskewl.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nooskewl.ca</a>.</div>
<div>Fast forward to 2014. We recently finished development of a new game called Crystal Picnic. You can buy the game from various sources right now. Today I'm here to pitch the idea of open sourcing Crystal Picnic just like we did with Monster RPG 2!</div>
<div>Open source games are a great learning tool. They also ensure that no matter what happens in the computer world, the game will always be able to run on the latest systems. On top of that, the licensing terms we will implement will make it possible for anyone who wants to make their own games based on Crystal Picnic and sell them or give them away for free.</div>
<div>One of the great things about this campaign is that we're letting you, our supporters, give direction on new features to add to the engine for everyone to use. Please read on if this interests you, and thank you for reading!</div> <h2><span style=""line-height: 30px;""><b></b></span></h2>
</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/909392/files/20141006173628-2.png?1412642188"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
<p>We're looking to reach a modest goal of $1,500 Canadian dollars with this campaign. The money will be divided two ways:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Perks</li>
<li>Paying for artwork that has already been made for the game</li>
</ul>
<div>The game is finished and out there to play, but I'm looking to gain some extra funding to pay for the artwork that I commissioned out of pocket. This includes:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Graphics</li>
<li>Sound and music</li>
<li>Story</li>
</ul>
<div>All of these assets will be available for everyone in the world to use in commercial and non-commercial works. The source code will also be made public. Everything will be under a liberal license that says you can use any license you want (GPL, BSD, Commercial, etc)! All we ask is that you don't use the name ""Crystal Picnic"" or the names of the main characters, Egbert and Frogbert, in your creations.</div>
<div>
The license to be used for everything released is <a href=""http://pastebin.com/aJjRLE4b"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">listed here</a>.</div>
<div>
<a href=""http://pastebin.com/t1x6N0wx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Some example code (the Whack a Skunk minigame)</a><br/>
</div>
<div>At the lower levels, the perks are for credits in the game and copies of our games from our website (<a href=""http://www.nooskewl.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">nooskewl.ca</a>). Upwards from there you can get beta access to our next game, Crystal Picnic t-shirts (black or navy), custom features hand-coded by me and added to the to-be-open-sourced engine, and at the highest tier, a swaggy Crystal Picnic hoodie (blue for men and purple for women, not available anywhere else)!</div>

<div>
<p>Your contributions will mean a lot to me. I spent 4 years and an unfathomable amount of money making Crystal Picnic. 100% of the profits will be used to pay debts, which in turn helps me get started on our next game (beta access available as a perk)!</p>
<p>On top of the benefit I get, everyone in the world who has an interest in games and open source benefits! People will be free to compile the game themselves and learn from it and adapt it for their own uses.

</div></div>","Hello. I am Trent Gamblin, Founder of Nooskewl in Canmore, Alberta. We are the developers of several games. One of those games is Monster RPG 2. In 2012, we had an Indiegogo campaign to open source Monster RPG 2 and it was successful. You can currently download the source code from nooskewl.ca.
Fast forward to 2014. We recently finished development of a new game called Crystal Picnic. You can buy the game from various sources right now. Today I'm here to pitch the idea of open sourcing Crystal Picnic just like we did with Monster RPG 2!
Open source games are a great learning tool. They also ensure that no matter what happens in the computer world, the game will always be able to run on the latest systems. On top of that, the licensing terms we will implement will make it possible for anyone who wants to make their own games based on Crystal Picnic and sell them or give them away for free.
One of the great things about this campaign is that we're letting you, our supporters, give direction on new features to add to the engine for everyone to use. Please read on if this interests you, and thank you for reading! 

We're looking to reach a modest goal of $1,500 Canadian dollars with this campaign. The money will be divided two ways:


Perks
Paying for artwork that has already been made for the game

The game is finished and out there to play, but I'm looking to gain some extra funding to pay for the artwork that I commissioned out of pocket. This includes:


Graphics
Sound and music
Story

All of these assets will be available for everyone in the world to use in commercial and non-commercial works. The source code will also be made public. Everything will be under a liberal license that says you can use any license you want (GPL, BSD, Commercial, etc)! All we ask is that you don't use the name ""Crystal Picnic"" or the names of the main characters, Egbert and Frogbert, in your creations.

The license to be used for everything released is listed here.

Some example code (the Whack a Skunk minigame)

At the lower levels, the perks are for credits in the game and copies of our games from our website (nooskewl.ca). Upwards from there you can get beta access to our next game, Crystal Picnic t-shirts (black or navy), custom features hand-coded by me and added to the to-be-open-sourced engine, and at the highest tier, a swaggy Crystal Picnic hoodie (blue for men and purple for women, not available anywhere else)!









Your contributions will mean a lot to me. I spent 4 years and an unfathomable amount of money making Crystal Picnic. 100% of the profits will be used to pay debts, which in turn helps me get started on our next game (beta access available as a perk)!
On top of the benefit I get, everyone in the world who has an interest in games and open source benefits! People will be free to compile the game themselves and learn from it and adapt it for their own uses. I personally look forward to seeing derivatives and unique games spawn from the Crystal Picnic engine!
The stretch goals will be great for everyone too, if reached.


If the campaign reaches $2,000, we will make Crystal Picnic free to download for a day from our website and iTunes.
If we reach $3,000 in funding, we'll port the game to Windows Phone! This is very important. Crystal Picnic uses Allegro 5, an open source game development library, and we'll be porting it as well as the game to Windows Phone. This makes the campaign interesting for all Allegro users.

<h2>In the New Galactic Authority, things are not going well.</h2>
<h3>With the alien Ke'Rel illegally colonising more of the Outer Arm planets, pirates disrupting interplanetary shipping and an unknown plague placing more ships under quarantine, the situation is running grim indeed.</h3>
<h3>Then the singing started.</h3>
<p><strong>A single voice over the Hypercom, it started as a lone signal picked up by a tramp freighter near the Galactic Hub; it was immediately dismissed as signal failure or an elaborate hoax. Increasing reports came in from other regions until finally the StarLiner Penumbra docked on Triton, all hands on board reported hearing an alien choir singing within their minds. </strong><br/><br/><strong> ‘What did they sing?’ asked one investigator.</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘Find us’.  They replied.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Triangulating the Penumbra’s course, researchers found the telepathic signal and traced it to a small planet in Orion’s Spur near the Perseus Arm. As the singing became almost unbearable, they found a small stone marker in a cave on the planet’s surface. When they picked it up, the singing abruptly stopped, to be replaced by a single, quiet voice once more calling from the far side of the Galaxy.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The marker was just a chunk of silicon with a few esoteric carvings but obviously of hidden monumental importance. </strong><strong>What was clear though was the marker was incomplete; whoever left this wanted them found and completed. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Once word of the signals and the markers was leaked however, every owner-operator, merchantman and pirate set out across the cosmos hoping to find the markers and solve the mystery; what secret did the markers lead to?</strong></p>
<h3>Clearly the markers pointed to something-</h3>
<h2>- something ancient, advanced and awakening...</h2>

<h3><strong>The Artifact is a game for 2-5 players where betraying your friends and stealing from them is as important as discovering resources and exploring the cosmos.<br/><br/>The Artifact uses an innovative map dynamic which means every game is unique and different.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Set in the far-future and featuring startling artwork, over 100 cards, exotic locations and constantly evolving play, The Artifact is a game like no other.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Win by strategy, tactics or blind luck!</strong></h3>

<h3>Hi!</h3>
<h3><strong>We're The Artifact Project and we hope you can help us.</strong></h3>
<h3><img alt=""Game Card 1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/927376/pictures/full/20130713051314-Alien_Repository.png?1373717596"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Alien Repository""/></h3>
<p><strong>We are a group of students, designers and gamers from Ireland.  We've been avid science fiction fans, gamers and paper gamers for many years and we'd like your help to bring our project to life.</strong></p>
<p>A few years ago, we came up with the idea for 'The Artifact'; a hybrid card and board game based around science fiction and space exploration where the cards become the gaming field for the players. </p>
<p>Players race and fight to collect four Artifact Markers hidden around the board.  These are needed to start the race to the Artifact and for one player to be declared the winner!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><img alt=""Game Card 2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/927382/pictures/full/20130713051629-Baby_Singularity.png?1373717792"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px;"" title=""Baby Singularity""/></h3>
<p>What makes The Artifact special is that every game is unique.  As players lay their locations down, the universe they explore evolves and changes and presents new challenges to the players.</p>
<p>The Artifact originally began as a 70 card prototype set; the set contained a deck and dice and contained art from google images just to fill the space. </p>
<p>It has now developed into a 100 card set with our own unique artwork, dice, counters and playing pieces, with more cards being developed to be expansions to the game if the first set is successful. </p>

<h3>The Artifact has many unique twists and turns.  Each and every card offers opportunities and disadvantages for the players.  Among the many features of the game are:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3> <strong>Straight Out of the Box!</strong>
</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The Artifact can be played by anyone!  The rules are straightforward and very easy to learn - its the cards that direct the course of the game!  The Artifact can be customised for a quick game or a long campaign.  Whether you're an absolute beginner or a seasoned gaming veteran, everyone has fun!<img alt=""Box"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/928116/pictures/full/20130713170252-Final_Box_Mockup.png?1373760176"" src="""" style="""" title=""Game Box""/><strong><br/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>  Unique Map Dynamics</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Each location contains direction markers that allow players to explore the galaxy they create.  Their movement is both restricted and helped by how the board is generated. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">You'll discover how amazingly satisfying it is to trap a leading player inside a Black Hole for a couple of turns!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><img alt=""Map Example"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/927712/pictures/full/20130713112810-map_example.png?1373740099"" src="""" style="""" title=""Map Example""/></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Distinctive Card Mechanics</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Each card in The Artifact dictates the rules of play.  While there is a rule book to deal with the general rules of the game, the surprises, victories and reversals of fortune arrive when players make their collective universe grow!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><img alt=""Player Guide"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/927702/pictures/full/20130713111520-Player_Guide_Sample.png?1373739323"" src="""" style="""" title=""Player Guide""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3> Unique, Distinct Player Factions</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p class=""font_8"" style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The Artifact contains 8 factions to choose from.  Each faction follows a clear ideology with their own special abilities.  From the mundane to the exotic, each one adds flavour and depth to the game.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h3>Colourful, Original Artwork </h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Each cards design, layout and background art has been a labour of love and frustration!  To create original art for each individual card in The Artifact, hundreds of hours of work has gone into each piece of digital art to tailor it to fit the style necassary for the game's science fiction appeal.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h3>Flavour!</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Most of the cards in The Artifact contain flavour text ranging from the profound to the ridiculous - all in keeping with the games asthetics!</p>

</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Easy to Play - Hard to Master!</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The Artifact is a game of quick tactics and long-term strategy.  The goal of the game is to find Artifact Markers and to stop your friends from doing the same.  This can be achieved by numerous methods and sneaky card play! </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">You can box, trap, foil or just downright steal from the other players!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Complete Game Set</h3>

<p>The Artifact is a labour of love and we have tried to be as self-sufficienct as possible.  To prove our case, everything you see has been designed and created by us;  from the cards, the box design, to the player pieces (except the dice!) we played to our strengths in every part of the development.  At a certain point however, outside help is needed and very welcome! </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The ultimate goal for The Artifact is for it to be played by as many people as possible.  Its an enjoyable, fun, addictive, high quality game but for a low price. </p>
<p>The cost of games today has risen sharply and we believe The Artifact should buck this trend. </p>
<p>We hope to retail The Artifact for around €25 - 30 or even less if the production costs can be kept down, with later expansions costing half that figure.  The philosophy behind the game and the project is to create more add-ons and expansions to the game, making it as open and as versatile as possible and to get the news of the game out to make it as accessible and affordable to all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For The Artifact to become a reality, funding is needed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3> Print out as many sets as the funding will allow. </h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The printing is the major expense in production, so the more we can afford to print, the cheaper each set will cost so we hope to create as many as possible to keep the overall final cost of the game down. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Create the pieces, counters and dice.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">There are model pieces for the players but these need to be injection moulded and this can be expensive for small production runs. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Dice and counters for the game have been sourced and this is just a small cost but it all adds up!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Production</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The Artifact box has been designed to look smart, elegant and fit all the pieces neatly and tidily away.  Its been well designed and can be printed locally and constructed by ourselves.  However the initial print run will be costly as well as the card stock needed for the boxes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>Marketing</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The game will be sold through two main sources, The Artifact Website:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><a href=""http://platinumflux.wix.com/the-artifact"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://platinumflux.wix.com/the-artifact</a></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">and from as many outlets as can be gathered.  Ireland has highly dedicated groups of gamers and suppliers but unfortunately it tends to be a small market.  Sample game sets will be sent across Ireland, the U.K and the U.S to garner support and at around €10 to send each set, this will be expensive to accomplish without your help.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<p>Even if we don't reach our funding goal, anything we do receive will enable us to create a number of complete games, certainly enough to fulfill our perks obligations and hopefully a few more for retail. </p>
<p>We have no doubt that the game will be popular, it will just take us a little longer to market it!</p>
<p>What you will help us achieve is the production of The Artifact as a finished, playable, marketable product that is as comprehensive and enjoyable as any game on the market today.  We have poured our heart, soul, energy and every spare minute into making The Artifact a game to be proud of.</p>

<h3>The Future</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>The Next Expansion<br/></strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><strong>- A 50 card expansion to The Artifact.  We wanted to add depth to the game by introducing a exploration dynamic.  Once a player lands, a further dimension opens up involving the players hunt for the Markers on the planet's surface.  Think of it as a game within the game!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong>Customizable Player Pack</strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><strong>- A 24 card expansion that enables players to adapt their game with specialised cards.</strong></p>

<h3>Getting The Artifact out to the world is our primary goal!</h3>
</div></span></div>","In the New Galactic Authority, things are not going well.
With the alien Ke'Rel illegally colonising more of the Outer Arm planets, pirates disrupting interplanetary shipping and an unknown plague placing more ships under quarantine, the situation is running grim indeed.
Then the singing started.
A single voice over the Hypercom, it started as a lone signal picked up by a tramp freighter near the Galactic Hub; it was immediately dismissed as signal failure or an elaborate hoax. Increasing reports came in from other regions until finally the StarLiner Penumbra docked on Triton, all hands on board reported hearing an alien choir singing within their minds.  ‘What did they sing?’ asked one investigator.
‘Find us’.  They replied.
Triangulating the Penumbra’s course, researchers found the telepathic signal and traced it to a small planet in Orion’s Spur near the Perseus Arm. As the singing became almost unbearable, they found a small stone marker in a cave on the planet’s surface. When they picked it up, the singing abruptly stopped, to be replaced by a single, quiet voice once more calling from the far side of the Galaxy.
The marker was just a chunk of silicon with a few esoteric carvings but obviously of hidden monumental importance. What was clear though was the marker was incomplete; whoever left this wanted them found and completed. 
Once word of the signals and the markers was leaked however, every owner-operator, merchantman and pirate set out across the cosmos hoping to find the markers and solve the mystery; what secret did the markers lead to?
Clearly the markers pointed to something-
- something ancient, advanced and awakening...

The Artifact is a game for 2-5 players where betraying your friends and stealing from them is as important as discovering resources and exploring the cosmos.The Artifact uses an innovative map dynamic which means every game is unique and different.
Set in the far-future and featuring startling artwork, over 100 cards, exotic locations and constantly evolving play, The Artifact is a game like no other.
Win by strategy, tactics or blind luck!

_______________________________________________

Hi!
We're The Artifact Project and we hope you can help us.

We are a group of students, designers and gamers from Ireland.  We've been avid science fiction fans, gamers and paper gamers for many years and we'd like your help to bring our project to life.
A few years ago, we came up with the idea for 'The Artifact'; a hybrid card and board game based around science fiction and space exploration where the cards become the gaming field for the players. 
Players race and fight to collect four Artifact Markers hidden around the board.  These are needed to start the race to the Artifact and for one player to be declared the winner!
 
 

What makes The Artifact special is that every game is unique.  As players lay their locations down, the universe they explore evolves and changes and presents new challenges to the players.
The Artifact originally began as a 70 card prototype set; the set contained a deck and dice and contained art from google images just to fill the space. 
It has now developed into a 100 card set with our own unique artwork, dice, counters and playing pieces, with more cards being developed to be expansions to the game if the first set is successful. 
 
 
_______________________________________________

The Artifact has many unique twists and turns.  Each and every card offers opportunities and disadvantages for the players.  Among the many features of the game are:


 Straight Out of the Box!



The Artifact can be played by anyone!  The rules are straightforward and very easy to learn - its the cards that direct the course of the game!  The Artifact can be customised for a quick game or a long campaign.  Whether you're an absolute beginner or a seasoned gaming veteran, everyone has fun!


  Unique Map Dynamics



Each location contains direction markers that allow players to explore the galaxy they create.  Their movement is both restricted and helped by how the board is generated. 
You'll discover how amazingly satisfying it is to trap a leading player inside a Black Hole for a couple of turns!

 


Distinctive Card Mechanics


Each card in The Artifact dictates the rules of play.  While there is a rule book to deal with the general rules of the game, the surprises, victories and reversals of fortune arrive when players make their collective universe grow!



 Unique, Distinct Player Factions


The Artifact contains 8 factions to choose from.  Each faction follows a clear ideology with their own special abilities.  From the mundane to the exotic, each one adds flavour and depth to the game.



Colourful, Original Artwork 


Each cards design, layout and background art has been a labour of love and frustration!  To create original art for each individual card in The Artifact, hundreds of hours of work has gone into each piece of digital art to tailor it to fit the style necassary for the game's science fiction appeal.



Flavour!


Most of the cards in The Artifact contain flavour text ranging from the profound to the ridiculous - all in keeping with the games asthetics!





Easy to Play - Hard to Master!


The Artifact is a game of quick tactics and long-term strategy.  The goal of the game is to find Artifact Markers and to stop your friends from doing the same.  This can be achieved by numerous methods and sneaky card play! 
You can box, trap, foil or just downright steal from the other players!


Complete Game Set


Each set of The Artifact contains:

100 unique cards.
8 Unique player Cards
2 6-sided dice and one 4 sided dice.
1 Rulebook.
8 Custom made playing pieces.
Fuel Counters
20 Artifact Markers
1 Artifact

_______________________________________________

The Artifact is a labour of love and we have tried to be as self-sufficienct as possible.  To prove our case, everything you see has been designed and created by us;  from the cards, the box design, to the player pieces (except the dice!) we played to our strengths in every part of the development.  At a certain point however, outside help is needed and very welcome! 


The ultimate goal for The Artifact is for it to be played by as many people as possible.  Its an enjoyable, fun, addictive, high quality game but for a low price. 
The cost of games today has risen sharply and we believe The Artifact should buck this trend. 
We hope to retail The Artifact for around €25 - 30 or even less if the production costs can be kept down, with later expansions costing half that figure.  The philosophy behind the game and the project is to create more add-ons and expansions to the game, making it as open and as versatile as possible and to get the news of the game out to make it as accessible and affordable to all.
 
For The Artifact to become a reality, funding is needed to:


 Print out as many sets as the funding will allow. 


The printing is the major expense in production, so the more we can afford to print, the cheaper each set will cost so we hope to create as many as possible to keep the overall final cost of the game down. 


Create the pieces, counters and dice.


There are model pieces for the players but these need to be injection moulded and this can be expensive for small production runs. 
Dice and counters for the game have been sourced and this is just a small cost but it all adds up!


Production


The Artifact box has been designed to look smart, elegant and fit all the pieces neatly and tidily away.  Its been well designed and can be printed locally and constructed by ourselves.  However the initial print run will be costly as well as the card stock needed for the boxes.


Marketing


The game will be sold through two main sources, The Artifact Website:
http://platinumflux.wix.com/the-artifact
and from as many outlets as can be gathered.  Ireland has highly dedicated groups of gamers and suppliers but unfortunately it tends to be a small market.  Sample game sets will be sent across Ireland, the U.K and the U.S to garner support and at around €10 to send each set, this will be expensive to accomplish without your help.

 
Even if we don't reach our funding goal, anything we do receive will enable us to create a number of complete games, certainly enough to fulfill our perks obligations and hopefully a few more for retail. 
We have no doubt that the game will be popular, it will just take us a little longer to market it!
What you will help us achieve is the production of The Artifact as a finished, playable, marketable product that is as comprehensive and enjoyable as any game on the market today.  We have poured our heart, soul, energy and every spare minute into making The Artifact a game to be proud of.

</div>
<div>
<p>In search for the Ultimate Power, a <strong>Dark Lord and his wretched army</strong> are ravaging a once peaceful land, destroying villages and leaving no good soul alive. To put a stop to this carnage, <strong>the warrior named Haggis must wield again his already bloodstained blade and chase down the Dark Lord</strong>. Odallus is the story of Haggis’ pursue in the format of a <strong>dark fantasy classic game</strong>.</p>
<p>Odallus is a NES inspired exploration game with lots of action. It will be divided in stages, but there is no one-way-only in Odallus and levels have many paths, including to other levels. However, all paths in Odallus are <strong>infested by dangers and demons</strong> to which Haggis must be always watchful. </p>
<h3>We expect to release Odallus in mid 2014.</h3>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://keyo.me/Indiegogo/8bit.gif"" src="""" style=""font-size: 1.5em;""/></p>
</div>
<p>Yes, Odallus focus on exploration but don't expect to only look for the best paths on Odallus.</p>

<h3>8Bit Art</h3>
<div>
<p>We have been working with pixel art for quite a while on JoyMasher's games and one of our favorite pixel art styles ever is NES 8bit. We have tried this style before on Oniken and Major Maox, but it never felt so right as in Odallus.</p>
<p>We used <strong>NES original color palette</strong> in all in-game graphics and most game's art and communication. Also, most of Odallus graphics respect NES' limitations for color and size of each image. Despite all these self imposed restrictions, we are confident Odallus recreates a antique and macabre atmosphere, something as<strong> Brave Heart and Highlander meets Evil Dead</strong>. Or just a <strong>Celtic 8bit game of Berserk</strong>. Our main inspiration for this sort of environment was <strong>Demon's Crest</strong>.</p>

<h3>Odallus' Pace</h3>
<p>We have been describing Odallus as an <strong><em>action exploration</em></strong> game and we really mean it. <em>Action</em> is important in all of our games, and in Odallus this is present with a lot of different enemies and mechanics; there is always something to be done. However, if you played out previous game Oniken you may be expecting the frenetic kind of action we did on that game and, I assure you, that is not our intention with Odallus! <strong>Odallus is about a more Castlevania and Ghosts'n Goblins</strong> like action than a Contra and Oniken one.</p>
<p><em>Exploration</em> will be present in each stage on Odallus. Stage progression will be linear as in most classic Castlevanias, but stages themselves will have <strong>multiple paths</strong>. In addition to this, Haggis will find <strong>new gear and upgrades</strong> along his way, which may result in opening new ways in previous stages. </p>

<h3>About the Demo</h3>
<p>Odallus' demo do not depict any level in particular and level design on it won't be used in the game. Instead, we built the demo willing to show you <strong>a bit  of everything</strong> you can expect in Odallus. The style of the level design, with many paths to be discovery, is one of the main aspects we wanted to demonstrate. Enemies, mechanics and upgrades are exactly like they will be in the game, except that there will be more of all of them (perhaps not in the same stage, but in the game altogether). </p>
<p>The demo is short, expect to finish it in about 30~50 minutes, so we end up not adding a save feature to it. Odallus will sure have saves and check points, we just didn't add them to the demo because we felt there was more important things to concentrate at doing in it. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://joymasher.com/odallus/images/line.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Platforms and technology</h3>
<p>We use Multimedia Fusion 2, and so, Odallus is Windows native. On Oniken, we were able to make MAC and Linux versions, but this requires some time which we prefer to take pos-Windows launch. However, depending on the turnout of this campaign, we may be able to invite other developers to help us on that!</p>

<div>
<p>As a young indie studio, while we are 100% independent creatively we are not fully independent financially. That's why all of us have day jobs, to keep paying the bills. It's a though routine but it pays off with pretty cool games. </p>
<p>However, we need in Odallus some things that no one in JoyMasher can do properly and we decided to hire two very talented people to do it. The first thing is the <strong>soundtrack</strong> and we found just the perfect person to reproduce those vibrant tones of the 8bit era compositions. His name is Tiago Santos and he had previously made some songs for Oniken too. He composes under the N-Freq Studio.</p>
<p>The other job we need to be done is <strong>video making</strong>. In Oniken, our dear friend <a href=""http://camelo.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gabriel Camelo</a> created <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixCI4JXUuUE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this amazing trailer</a> and we hope he can continue making awesome trailers for our retro games.</p>
<p>Altogether, Camelo and Santos' work sums up to roughly <strong>$5,000</strong>, which is the exact value of this pledge. If this pledge is successful and even some extra money is brought together, it will be fully reinvested on Odallus. We have a list of features that we would <em>love </em>to see in the game but that we had to cross in early development due to time and money restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>However, if enough people believe in Odallus, some or all of these features can be brought back!</strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://joymasher.com/odallus/images/line.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><span>Why Flexible Campaign</span></h3>
<p><span>We chose a flexible campaign because, funded or not funded, we will make Odallus and any contribuition will help us. Like, help a lot.</span></p>
<p><span> This campaign is meant to help us pay Camelo and Santos <em>while</em> they are working and not only after the game is released, to aid our developing process and make the game <em>even better</em>. If you still have any doubts, fell free to email us at hello [at] joymasher.com!</span></p>

<p><strong>Marco Galvão</strong> — Creating computer games since he was 8, Marco is now studying to be a Computational Mathematician, but without droping the passion for game design and programming. His boost drink for a long night of productivity is Coke for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Danilo Dias</strong> — Videogames are, pretty much, one of the biggest parts of Danilo’s life.

<p><strong>Thais Weiller </strong>— Graduated as a journalist, Thaís pretty soon realized she wasn’t cut out for it. So she decided to study game design and started a master on the subject. She fell so much about it that she began designing games herself for some Brazilian game companies.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</div>
</div></div>","From the makers of Oniken:
A 8bit Action Exploration Platformer that takes place in a Dark Fantasy world.
Don't believe me? Play the demo! 








In search for the Ultimate Power, a Dark Lord and his wretched army are ravaging a once peaceful land, destroying villages and leaving no good soul alive. To put a stop to this carnage, the warrior named Haggis must wield again his already bloodstained blade and chase down the Dark Lord. Odallus is the story of Haggis’ pursue in the format of a dark fantasy classic game.
Odallus is a NES inspired exploration game with lots of action. It will be divided in stages, but there is no one-way-only in Odallus and levels have many paths, including to other levels. However, all paths in Odallus are infested by dangers and demons to which Haggis must be always watchful. 
We expect to release Odallus in mid 2014.


Yes, Odallus focus on exploration but don't expect to only look for the best paths on Odallus.




8Bit Art

We have been working with pixel art for quite a while on JoyMasher's games and one of our favorite pixel art styles ever is NES 8bit. We have tried this style before on Oniken and Major Maox, but it never felt so right as in Odallus.
We used NES original color palette in all in-game graphics and most game's art and communication. Also, most of Odallus graphics respect NES' limitations for color and size of each image. Despite all these self imposed restrictions, we are confident Odallus recreates a antique and macabre atmosphere, something as Brave Heart and Highlander meets Evil Dead. Or just a Celtic 8bit game of Berserk. Our main inspiration for this sort of environment was Demon's Crest.




 


Odallus' Pace
We have been describing Odallus as an action exploration game and we really mean it. Action is important in all of our games, and in Odallus this is present with a lot of different enemies and mechanics; there is always something to be done. However, if you played out previous game Oniken you may be expecting the frenetic kind of action we did on that game and, I assure you, that is not our intention with Odallus! Odallus is about a more Castlevania and Ghosts'n Goblins like action than a Contra and Oniken one.
Exploration will be present in each stage on Odallus. Stage progression will be linear as in most classic Castlevanias, but stages themselves will have multiple paths. In addition to this, Haggis will find new gear and upgrades along his way, which may result in opening new ways in previous stages. 



If you like good ol' exploration games, Odallus is for you!


Non-linear levels


Sharp controls


Five different areas


Rad 8-bit graphics


Filled with hordes of demons


Thrilling atmosphere


Huge bosses





About the Demo
Odallus' demo do not depict any level in particular and level design on it won't be used in the game. Instead, we built the demo willing to show you a bit  of everything you can expect in Odallus. The style of the level design, with many paths to be discovery, is one of the main aspects we wanted to demonstrate. Enemies, mechanics and upgrades are exactly like they will be in the game, except that there will be more of all of them (perhaps not in the same stage, but in the game altogether). 
The demo is short, expect to finish it in about 30~50 minutes, so we end up not adding a save feature to it. Odallus will sure have saves and check points, we just didn't add them to the demo because we felt there was more important things to concentrate at doing in it. 

Platforms and technology
We use Multimedia Fusion 2, and so, Odallus is Windows native. On Oniken, we were able to make MAC and Linux versions, but this requires some time which we prefer to take pos-Windows launch. However, depending on the turnout of this campaign, we may be able to invite other developers to help us on that!

Minimum System Requirements
1.6GHZ Processor /512 MB RAM /60 MB free hard disk space /DirectX 9 compatible VGA /Windows XP
Estimated launch: Mid 2014



As a young indie studio, while we are 100% independent creatively we are not fully independent financially. That's why all of us have day jobs, to keep paying the bills. It's a though routine but it pays off with pretty cool games. 
However, we need in Odallus some things that no one in JoyMasher can do properly and we decided to hire two very talented people to do it. The first thing is the soundtrack and we found just the perfect person to reproduce those vibrant tones of the 8bit era compositions. His name is Tiago Santos and he had previously made some songs for Oniken too. He composes under the N-Freq Studio.
The other job we need to be done is video making. In Oniken, our dear friend Gabriel Camelo created this amazing trailer and we hope he can continue making awesome trailers for our retro games.
Altogether, Camelo and Santos' work sums up to roughly $5,000, which is the exact value of this pledge. If this pledge is successful and even some extra money is brought together, it will be fully reinvested on Odallus. We have a list of features that we would love to see in the game but that we had to cross in early development due to time and money restrictions.
However, if enough people believe in Odallus, some or all of these features can be brought back!

Why Flexible Campaign
We chose a flexible campaign because, funded or not funded, we will make Odallus and any contribuition will help us. Like, help a lot.
 This campaign is meant to help us pay Camelo and Santos while they are working and not only after the game is released, to aid our developing process and make the game even better. If you still have any doubts, fell free to email us at hello [at] joymasher.com!

<p lang=""en""><strong><em>Beyond raising the funds for this project, there is a reason much closer to our hearts at Xeni Games for why we've decided to launch this campaign.</em></strong></p>
<p lang=""en""><span>As the Lead Creative Director at Xeni Games I desire to help people <em><strong>expand their imagination</strong></em>, and <em><strong>discover</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>beauty of creativity</strong></em>. </span></p>
<p lang=""en""><span>As someone who has always been involved in creative fields, there is nothing that I enjoy more than exploring my mind and the minds of others. </span>Tabletop roleplaying games have always been a great source for sharing that same feeling with others.</p>
<p lang=""en""><span>I wanted to create a framework that was robust enough to provide a great base for gameplay even for those who are experienced players, but simple enough to allow players new to tabletop RPGs to join in without becoming overwhelmed by hundreds of pages of rules and content that they aren't familiar with or do not have the time to become involved in.</span></p>
<h3><img alt=""The Iternus System"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/HHJNS.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Iternus System""/></h3>
<p lang=""en""><span><span>The resulting product was <strong>The Iternus System</strong>. A framework built to encourage players to use their imagination, as well as assisting them in unlocking the innate creativity within us all.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>The Iternus System</strong> is built to stand out amongst the crowd by offering many intuitive yet easily managed mechanics to players and Game Masters:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Scalable Game Complexity</strong> - <strong>The Iternus System</strong> framework is robust enough to provide an entertaining session for experienced tabletop gamers, yet flexible enough to allow those new to tabletop gaming to ease into the ebb and flow of a campaign without being overwhelmed by too many unfamiliar mechanics. Scaling is handled by offering a range of different sets of mechanics. For example, if you want to run a campaign that is simplistic and only takes advantage of the barebones framework <em>(simplistic determination of your health points, damage dealt while attacking NPCs, and discovering what's in your environment)</em> that <strong>The Iternus System</strong> provides, we explain how to set up a game of this style. This set is generally suited for games that want to focus heavily around storytelling, or want to introduce new players to tabletop gaming. However, if you want to run a campaign that is more advanced where characters have detailed armor / weapon stats, attacking requires rolling for initiative depending on the situation you are in, and Tactics Mode has a statistic for each unit or a range of statistics that need to be compared for battles, we also provide that set in the framework book.</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Template System -</strong> Built into the core of <strong>The Iternus System</strong> and its accompanying campaigns, the Template System not only allows but encourages expansion upon the base content provided. The template system is structured so that players can create their own additions that seamlessly plug into the 'canon' mythos.</p>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Highly Customizable Skill Tree Structure</strong> - For those interested in an easily set up and easily run gaming session, creating your character's skill tree out of the preset content provided will be the best choice. For those interested in having a much more in-depth experience, we offer the ability to create your own skills and determine how they grow with your character.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Universal Character Persistence</strong> - With <strong>The Iternus System</strong>, players are not required to lock their characters down to a single campaign. Gaming Universes (such as <strong>Aetherium</strong>) are built to house all of the content for all future campaigns to be run within it. This allows player characters to persist, rather than having to create a new character to play a new campaign. The option to create new characters is always available, but for people who wish to keep using their characters after the completion of a campaign they can continue to do so.  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Unique Magic Framework</strong> - <strong>The Iternus System</strong> comes with two separate magic frameworks that can either be used in conjunction with each other or used separately as the sole frameworks for magic in a campaign. The first framework is the <strong>Fantasy Magic</strong> framework, and is based off of mechanics most people are familiar with, such as your character having a pool of mana and skills draw off of that pool of mana which regenerates over time and grows with your character. The second framework is the <strong>Realistic Magic</strong> framework that works quite differently than most mechanics people are used to. With the Realistic Magic framework, if you are a magically inclined user you are required to harvest your resources from the environment directly. The resources that are harvested can be stored within the character's body, or a receptacle designed to hold a finite amount of <strong><em>Magic Units</em></strong>, which all resources are converted into based on a dice roll. Depending on the actions you wish to perform and how you wish to perform them will determine how your Magic Units are depleted. The Realistic Magic framework allows for magic to be implemented into campaigns of any genre without being unnecessarily disruptive, and adds a new dimension to the environment.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Streamlined Economic Framework -</strong> Encourages players of all experience levels to venture into the busy world of being an entrepreneur.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Karma - </strong>Be rewarded for positive actions, or receive negative karma for disruptive and antagonistic actions. Karma affects the way the environment reacts to each player. Several players in the same area could experience different results based on their karma, opening up new possibilities for actions. Players with a negative karma play style may focus on preying on those with a positive karma play style to reap the rewards they discover out in the vast universe due to their mostly positive actions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Tactics Mode -</strong> Tactics Mode allows players to seamlessly switch from their player character to controlling a squadron of units or even an entire army depending on the campaign at hand. Inspired by Real Time Strategy gaming, Tactics Mode allows players to interact with the world at hand on a much grander scale. Which side will win? How will you manage your units? Will an unsuspecting third party take advantage of two warring races distracting each other and attack both sides of the battlefield and end up victorious? Engage Tactics Mode and unlock your potential. </li>

At the end of this campaign we will start to add all of the ranks and thank you mentions to our website and books.
We will be shipping out our perks internationally, so don't hesitate to claim a perk even if you don't live in North America. We are also very willing to take suggestions if none of the perks available catch your interest.
Aetherium will feature art by the amazing artist Heavenwill. You can find his portfolio here.
I'm pleased to announce that our artist, Long ""Heavenwill"" Pham has just completed some T Shirt designs for The Iternus System and Aetherium funders! More details about how to get one of these sweet shirts coming soon!



 

Beyond raising the funds for this project, there is a reason much closer to our hearts at Xeni Games for why we've decided to launch this campaign.
As the Lead Creative Director at Xeni Games I desire to help people expand their imagination, and discover the beauty of creativity. 
As someone who has always been involved in creative fields, there is nothing that I enjoy more than exploring my mind and the minds of others. Tabletop roleplaying games have always been a great source for sharing that same feeling with others.
I wanted to create a framework that was robust enough to provide a great base for gameplay even for those who are experienced players, but simple enough to allow players new to tabletop RPGs to join in without becoming overwhelmed by hundreds of pages of rules and content that they aren't familiar with or do not have the time to become involved in.

The resulting product was The Iternus System. A framework built to encourage players to use their imagination, as well as assisting them in unlocking the innate creativity within us all.
The Iternus System is built to stand out amongst the crowd by offering many intuitive yet easily managed mechanics to players and Game Masters:


Scalable Game Complexity - The Iternus System framework is robust enough to provide an entertaining session for experienced tabletop gamers, yet flexible enough to allow those new to tabletop gaming to ease into the ebb and flow of a campaign without being overwhelmed by too many unfamiliar mechanics. Scaling is handled by offering a range of different sets of mechanics. For example, if you want to run a campaign that is simplistic and only takes advantage of the barebones framework (simplistic determination of your health points, damage dealt while attacking NPCs, and discovering what's in your environment) that The Iternus System provides, we explain how to set up a game of this style. This set is generally suited for games that want to focus heavily around storytelling, or want to introduce new players to tabletop gaming. However, if you want to run a campaign that is more advanced where characters have detailed armor / weapon stats, attacking requires rolling for initiative depending on the situation you are in, and Tactics Mode has a statistic for each unit or a range of statistics that need to be compared for battles, we also provide that set in the framework book.

Template System - Built into the core of The Iternus System and its accompanying campaigns, the Template System not only allows but encourages expansion upon the base content provided. The template system is structured so that players can create their own additions that seamlessly plug into the 'canon' mythos.


Highly Customizable Skill Tree Structure - For those interested in an easily set up and easily run gaming session, creating your character's skill tree out of the preset content provided will be the best choice. For those interested in having a much more in-depth experience, we offer the ability to create your own skills and determine how they grow with your character.



Universal Character Persistence - With The Iternus System, players are not required to lock their characters down to a single campaign. Gaming Universes (such as Aetherium) are built to house all of the content for all future campaigns to be run within it. This allows player characters to persist, rather than having to create a new character to play a new campaign. The option to create new characters is always available, but for people who wish to keep using their characters after the completion of a campaign they can continue to do so.  



Unique Magic Framework - The Iternus System comes with two separate magic frameworks that can either be used in conjunction with each other or used separately as the sole frameworks for magic in a campaign. The first framework is the Fantasy Magic framework, and is based off of mechanics most people are familiar with, such as your character having a pool of mana and skills draw off of that pool of mana which regenerates over time and grows with your character. The second framework is the Realistic Magic framework that works quite differently than most mechanics people are used to. With the Realistic Magic framework, if you are a magically inclined user you are required to harvest your resources from the environment directly. The resources that are harvested can be stored within the character's body, or a receptacle designed to hold a finite amount of Magic Units, which all resources are converted into based on a dice roll. Depending on the actions you wish to perform and how you wish to perform them will determine how your Magic Units are depleted. The Realistic Magic framework allows for magic to be implemented into campaigns of any genre without being unnecessarily disruptive, and adds a new dimension to the environment.



Streamlined Economic Framework - Encourages players of all experience levels to venture into the busy world of being an entrepreneur.



Karma - Be rewarded for positive actions, or receive negative karma for disruptive and antagonistic actions. Karma affects the way the environment reacts to each player. Several players in the same area could experience different results based on their karma, opening up new possibilities for actions. Players with a negative karma play style may focus on preying on those with a positive karma play style to reap the rewards they discover out in the vast universe due to their mostly positive actions.



Tactics Mode - Tactics Mode allows players to seamlessly switch from their player character to controlling a squadron of units or even an entire army depending on the campaign at hand. Inspired by Real Time Strategy gaming, Tactics Mode allows players to interact with the world at hand on a much grander scale. Which side will win? How will you manage your units? Will an unsuspecting third party take advantage of two warring races distracting each other and attack both sides of the battlefield and end up victorious? Engage Tactics Mode and unlock your potential.

Aetherium showcases the wide range of possibilities that The Iternus System provides for an entertaining gaming session. 
Built off of The Iternus System framework, Aetherium is an entire gaming universe. The initial content released with Aetherium will cover the basic details of the universe, such as the galaxies, the species that live within those galaxies, and will include several scenarios to start your own campaigns with.
Our dream is to continue releasing unique content for the Aetherium universe after we have this first edition released to the public. You can expect to see campaigns focused around specific species in Aetherium, specific planets or cities within Aetherium, and much more.
Aetherium is a space opera themed universe.

Explore the vast reaches of space. 
Venture through the four galaxies of known sentient space. 
Encounter mysterious and unusual space anomalies. 
Play as or interact with over 15 species included with the base universe. 

Don't want to play as any of the provided races?
With the Template System you can create your own playable or additional NPC races!
You can also create: 

Anomalies 
Vehicles 
Whole galaxies brimming with life and activity!

Want to become a space-faring entrepreneur? With the economic model provided by The Iternus System you can:


Create your own corporation 
Take out a loan to help with the startup.

The money raised through this campaign will go directly towards producing, developing and publishing The Iternus System and Aetherium. A majority of the funds raised will be invested in hiring artists, the printing costs for the perks we are offering our funders, and any other projected related expenses that may arise. 
We have big dreams, and we hope to convey them to you through our final product.
By funding this campaign you will be playing a significant role in the birth of a company that wishes to foster creativity and imagination in people all over the world.
Should we reach our goal, any additional money raised will go towards hiring additional artists, unlocking our stretch goals, and to the author.

<h3>Why this campaign?</h3>
<p>After 4+ years of development, we run out of money. We did everything that we could but now it is up to you. If you want to play a finished game then please support us.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the development of this game must be paused.</p>
<h3>About game</h3>
<p>Game website: <a href=""http://www.murnatan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.murnatan.com</a><br/>Game forum: <a href=""http://forum.murnatan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">forum.murnatan.com</a></p>
<p>Murnatan is online team multiplayer 3D FPS combined with RTS. In short: the team of aliens fighting against the team of humans. </p>
<p>But it is not just shooting for score. If you will camp and kill millions of enemies then you will still lose. You have to destroy enemy spawns and then kill all enemies. But they can build new spawns and not only spawns but many other things.</p>
<p>Each team is totally different. Humans using long-range weapons and they can buy better weapons in Armoury (that is also buildable structure). But Aliens using melee attacks, traps, debuffs, poisons, they can evolve to better aliens and some of them can walk on walls and ceilings.</p>
<p>For more information visit the Steam page (<a href=""http://store.steampowered.com/app/634070/Murnatan/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">download link</a>) or just try the game.</p>
<p>BTW, try to sniff and taunt with different aliens to provoke humans.</p>

<h3>About author</h3>
<p>I love games. I played them on Arcade Machines, C64, Amiga 600, Amiga 1200, PSX, PC, and PS4. And one time I discovered the game with name Tremulous. Action multiplayer game with aliens vs humans. There players building bases during the game. Amazing thing. I created maps, developed modified server, created three server mods and we become a bunch of good players with many unforgettable stories in the game (hi!). </p>
<p>But Tremulous died. Old engine, no maintenance... There was no similar game and I decided to resurrect it. To create the complete game from scratch with the new engine but with the same gameplay. </p>
<p>I got the small team together and we started. We created some ideas, concepts and went to Kickstarter. Of course, we failed - no product, unknown team, almost no community. But I stated even before that if Kickstarter will fail then development will still continue somewhat.</p>
<p>I got a job. The team was working on Murnatan and I was working in a different job and at evening I continued working on Murnatan too. I spent all my salary to our team. But it is not possible to do this all time (4+ years) and now I can't continue like that. So our last chance how to finish this game is this campaign. </p>
<p>We are in similar situation like on Kickstarter before. But there are two differences. First, we already have the working product, Murnatan game. Second, this time if this campaign will not succeed then development will not continue. </p>
<p>Now it is really up to you. If you want to have finished game, please support us and tell about it everywhere. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<p>Well, we need only money. All that time it was only about one damned thing and that is money. With enough money, we would have finished the game after 2 years of development.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520454915/mksrfui0teymxbdlc8kb.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What needs to be done</h3>
<p>Mostly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Admin system (Admin accounts, Server owners, Moderators, Ability to block accounts, etc.)</li>
<li>In-Game shop</li>
<li>Mod support</li>
<li>Capella section</li>
<li>More maps</li>
<li>Theme maps (Story maps)</li>
<li>Overhauled UI</li>
<li>Variable building system</li>
<li>Achievements</li>
<li>Trade cards</li>
<li>Complete server administration</li>
<li>Various game mods</li>
<li>and more...</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>Some rewards will be delivered later - coupons to in-game shop, skins or credit records in a book because the store and the book are not yet finished.</p>
<h3>VIP status</h3>
<p>Later you will be able to buy limited VIP status from the in-game shop and it will be time-limited. VIP will unlock your full game and other things (kick prevention from non-VIPs, possible to play on servers only for VIP etc.). </p>
<p>The current version of the game is not limited at all, but that can change later.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; challenges</h3>
<p>There is only one risk. If we don't get the requested money = the game will remain in the current state.</p>
<p>There are no other risks.</p>
<p>Challenges? Yes, there are some challenges because of Unreal Engine 4 - that engine can create many challenges like hearing sounds through walls or weapons clipping into walls but that is a small problem compared to everything else.</p>

Why this campaign?
After 4+ years of development, we run out of money. We did everything that we could but now it is up to you. If you want to play a finished game then please support us.
Otherwise, the development of this game must be paused.
About game
Game website: www.murnatan.comGame forum: forum.murnatan.com
Murnatan is online team multiplayer 3D FPS combined with RTS. In short: the team of aliens fighting against the team of humans. 
But it is not just shooting for score. If you will camp and kill millions of enemies then you will still lose. You have to destroy enemy spawns and then kill all enemies. But they can build new spawns and not only spawns but many other things.
Each team is totally different. Humans using long-range weapons and they can buy better weapons in Armoury (that is also buildable structure). But Aliens using melee attacks, traps, debuffs, poisons, they can evolve to better aliens and some of them can walk on walls and ceilings.
For more information visit the Steam page (download link) or just try the game.
BTW, try to sniff and taunt with different aliens to provoke humans.

About author
I love games. I played them on Arcade Machines, C64, Amiga 600, Amiga 1200, PSX, PC, and PS4. And one time I discovered the game with name Tremulous. Action multiplayer game with aliens vs humans. There players building bases during the game. Amazing thing. I created maps, developed modified server, created three server mods and we become a bunch of good players with many unforgettable stories in the game (hi!). 
But Tremulous died. Old engine, no maintenance... There was no similar game and I decided to resurrect it. To create the complete game from scratch with the new engine but with the same gameplay. 
I got the small team together and we started. We created some ideas, concepts and went to Kickstarter. Of course, we failed - no product, unknown team, almost no community. But I stated even before that if Kickstarter will fail then development will still continue somewhat.
I got a job. The team was working on Murnatan and I was working in a different job and at evening I continued working on Murnatan too. I spent all my salary to our team. But it is not possible to do this all time (4+ years) and now I can't continue like that. So our last chance how to finish this game is this campaign. 
We are in similar situation like on Kickstarter before. But there are two differences. First, we already have the working product, Murnatan game. Second, this time if this campaign will not succeed then development will not continue. 
Now it is really up to you. If you want to have finished game, please support us and tell about it everywhere. 


What we need
Well, we need only money. All that time it was only about one damned thing and that is money. With enough money, we would have finished the game after 2 years of development.


What needs to be done
Mostly:

Admin system (Admin accounts, Server owners, Moderators, Ability to block accounts, etc.)
In-Game shop
Mod support
Capella section
More maps
Theme maps (Story maps)
Overhauled UI
Variable building system
Achievements
Trade cards
Complete server administration
Various game mods
and more...

Rewards
Some rewards will be delivered later - coupons to in-game shop, skins or credit records in a book because the store and the book are not yet finished.
VIP status
Later you will be able to buy limited VIP status from the in-game shop and it will be time-limited. VIP will unlock your full game and other things (kick prevention from non-VIPs, possible to play on servers only for VIP etc.). 
The current version of the game is not limited at all, but that can change later.
Risks & challenges
There is only one risk. If we don't get the requested money = the game will remain in the current state.
There are no other risks.
Challenges? Yes, there are some challenges because of Unreal Engine 4 - that engine can create many challenges like hearing sounds through walls or weapons clipping into walls but that is a small problem compared to everything else.


Other ways you can help

<h3>Here's What I'm Asking For</h3>
<p>I'm making a video game called ""The United Space of America."" It's about an alternate version of the US being blown off of the Earth by an alien force and the President of the United States putting it back together by fighting the aliens with a cannon mounted on his shoulder. I'm well underway in my production and have just released demos on STEAM and itch.io platforms, but I need a couple of instruments and a piece of equipment to finish the music.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm Mark. I'm a budding video game developer and seasoned musician. I'm passionate about gaming and the culture around it. One day, a friend of mine asked, ""If you were to make your own game, what would it be?"" I answered in full detail without missing a beat. This is something I've always wanted to do, but I didn't know anything about coding or game design (still learning.) At that moment, I decided to teach myself and a year later, here I am.</li>
<li>This campaign is an attempt to get a modest amount of funding to purchase my own guitar, bass and audio interface. </li>
<li>I know what you're thinking, ""But Mark, if you're such a seasoned musician, why don't you already have those things?"" That is a good question. Over the years, I've started to wane on my direction as an artist. I knew that I loved making music, but couldn't find motivation to make new music, so I sold my guitars. I still have an audio interface, but it's very old and on the fritz. When I started making USoA, my fire to create music was hotter than ever! I wanted to make music for video games. That's what I've always wanted, but now I know that I want to make games, too! Unfortunately, due to recent circumstances, I'm not in a financial position to purchase these things on my own. I'm very fortunate to have friends that let me borrow their equipment, but I'd love to have my own, again. I want nothing more than to make this and many other games and a big part of that is having the ability to compose and perform the music for this and future projects. If you think you can help, I'd like to make it worth your while in my own way.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>I'm Looking for a Guitar, a Bass and an Audio Interface.</h3>
<p>Here's the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>I need $350 for a guitar, $250 for a bass and $100 for an audio interface (though the last part is the least important.)</li>
<li>As a thanks for helping me out, I have a variety of donation incentives ranging from a mention in the credits of USoA, a personalized picture of me, shirtless on a bed writing in my diary, to becoming a character in game complete with a pixelated version of yourself.</li>
<li>If $250 or less is reached, that will go toward a purchase of a bass. If $600 or less is reached, I will purchase a guitar and bass. If raise the full $700, I'll acquire all three. If anything beyond that goal is reached, that will appreciate the value of the equipment I choose to purchase.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>I Really Appreciate Anything You Can Do</h3>
<ul>
<li>Making this game has changed my life. I have a new drive in me that I haven't felt in a very long time.</li>
<li>I'll admit, I've never finished a game before, but this is my first one, and we're doing pretty well, so far. We're getting very close to being at 100% complete.</li>
<li>If you'd get a kick out of being a part of an official video game being released on a reputable platform that's about America getting blowed off the Earth and a fictional President based on yours truly putting it back together, you're in the right place.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>I'm going to be honest with you, I think there's little doubt that I'll finish this game, but the quality of the end product is at stake.</p>
<ul>
<li>The worst case scenario is how long it takes to complete the game and the donation incentives. It might be a while.</li>
<li>That being said, I'm not asking for that much, so I don't anticipate many donations, so keeping up shouldn't be a problem. The game itself is months away from completion.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>If You Can't Donate</h3>
<p>Here's some ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just interact with  me on social media. Spread the word about USoA and my campaign.</li>
<li>If you're a STEAM user, write a review for The United SPACE of America. Follow me on twitter, add the Fractured Earth page on FB. Anything you can do would be very appreciated!</li>

Nyarlahotep as Snoop Dogg would have powers of subterfuge, stealing opponent cards, when damaged heavily could cause madness in an enemy card causing that card to attack his/her allies.

As an example, Tupac, drawing from the messianic power pool, would start with abilities to increase positive power of other cards, heal hitpoints, amplify abilities and such, the more damage taken the closer he would come to ability to call God's wrath causing mass insta-kills of opponent's cards or resurrection or invincibility. Nyarlahotep as Snoop Dogg would have powers of subterfuge, stealing opponent cards, when damaged heavily could cause madness in an enemy card causing that card to attack his/her allies. GZA would have technology powers, killer robots etc., the possibilities are only as limited as the imagination of the creators.Now, take those possibilities and give them to the people. A card designer, where users can create their own custom artwork for each character, choose their own abilities, select the associated faiths/mythologies, and the cards that get the most upvotes are selected for official decks and balanced by either a panel or some kind of AI.Turn all of this into a game playable from cellphones and you can add music from each character on play or card 'turn'. People can select their decks based on their favorite artists and have rap battles alongside play. And with drill-down info there could be bios and history for each character.now a stupid cartoon from our sponsors...

</div> <p></p>Eerie Games is a small studio made up of a handful of passionate developers, artists and programmers, from various parts of the world. Though not physically established or corporately funded, our love for video games and creative ambitions have brought us together through the internet to do what we've always dreamed. Currently, we have one other game released of Steam (Red Goblin: Cursed Forest). With some new artistic talents and renewed drive, we are working on our next title; Vanaheim Tales.<br/><br/><ul><li>What we want with our efforts is to deliver a nostalgic but worthwhile gaming experience. One inspired by the games of old but with fresh, new innovation. A game that's as fun for us to develop as it is for you to play it.<br/>
</li></ul><br/><ul><li>If you do so choose to aid us in our efforts, you'll get a few things in return. First off; our gratitude! As real people spotted all about the world, we appreciate every little bit of investment and encouragement, monetary or otherwise. Every team member is essentially working for free at the moment and it will remain our passion project. Until sales begin and revenue is generated, we have no money in our pockets.</li></ul><ul><li>And, you know, some perks. Those are right over, to the right. Check 'em out!<br/>

Though working for free, we are also motivated by our zeal for developing. Basically, the game happens whether we're funded or not. So why help?<br/><br/><ul><li>Developers are real people! Every member is working daily on new art, features and narrative and game design. We carry on because we're confident our efforts and motivations will show through to the final project in a game obviously made with love.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Exclusive perks and content! Of course we can't just accept your aid for a thank you and chest full of warm fuzzy feelings. In exchange for your donations, depending on amount, you can get anything from specifically requested content to a digital, or even one of five physically produced copies of of the game.

<p>A JRPG full of tons of throwbacks to everything that inspired our loyalty to the genre in the first place- with a few of own twists thrown in. A story that promises to draw you in with political intrigue and a thought-provoking pitch at the concepts of religious and scientific warfare; a clash between a secretive alchemist and the angels he's found to be keeping a dark secret..<br/></p> <ul> <li>10-20 Hrs of game play.</li> <li>8 playable characters to join your party.</li>
<li>A unique Alchemy mechanic that gives you..</li>
<li>
<i>Hundreds</i> of different items to collect. From potions and equipment to alchemy recipes, materials and more.</li>
<li>A story open to influence. With several diverging paths to choose from, your choice matters in what the experience unfolding before you ends up being.</li>
<li>3 Different endings. </li>
</ul>
<div><b>Unique Features</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Alchemy system</b>:In the universe of Vanaheim, magic is an art and a science forbidden by those known as Angels- locked and kept from humans, in prevention of its violent and catastrophic abuse. Whatever their intentions, however, those known as Demons have come to humanity with the forbidden knowledge to teach them and spread alchemical instruction through tomes and scattered recipes. In Vanaheim Tales, there is no ""Mana"" or ""MP"" stat- all magical spells, or Alchemies, are cast by means of gathered ingredients and materials. This encourages the player to plan ahead and collect strategically for the enemies and environments they choose to explore.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>No random encounters:</b> There are no random battles in Vanaheim tales, every monster can be seen walking or patrolling on the maps. Tired of combat, in a rush, or unprepared for an enemy? Tuck and roll! Dash and dodge! Evading the enemy is often a possibility with enough speed, dexterity or creativity.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Skill System:</b> Alchemy of course isn't the only field of expertise available to the player- other such skills, requiring Skill Points (SP), are also acquirable for a slightly more traditional RPG experience. Using a sword, a staff, a pole-arm, shield, or even bare handed - skills can be trained from meager defenses and attacks to powerful tools against customizable enemy types.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Along with all the regular systems like Elemental effectiveness, Status effects, Leveling and Exploring; you get a <b>Teleport System</b>, this way you don't need to spend hours walking to reach the next town or dungeon. </li>

Though not physically established or corporately funded, our love for video games and creative ambitions have brought us together through the internet to do what we've always dreamed. Currently, we have one other game released of Steam (Red Goblin: Cursed Forest). With some new artistic talents and renewed drive, we are working on our next title; Vanaheim Tales.What we want with our efforts is to deliver a nostalgic but worthwhile gaming experience. One inspired by the games of old but with fresh, new innovation. A game that's as fun for us to develop as it is for you to play it.

Unique Features



Alchemy system:In the universe of Vanaheim, magic is an art and a science forbidden by those known as Angels- locked and kept from humans, in prevention of its violent and catastrophic abuse. Whatever their intentions, however, those known as Demons have come to humanity with the forbidden knowledge to teach them and spread alchemical instruction through tomes and scattered recipes. In Vanaheim Tales, there is no ""Mana"" or ""MP"" stat- all magical spells, or Alchemies, are cast by means of gathered ingredients and materials. This encourages the player to plan ahead and collect strategically for the enemies and environments they choose to explore.



No random encounters: There are no random battles in Vanaheim tales, every monster can be seen walking or patrolling on the maps. Tired of combat, in a rush, or unprepared for an enemy? Tuck and roll! Dash and dodge! Evading the enemy is often a possibility with enough speed, dexterity or creativity.



Skill System: Alchemy of course isn't the only field of expertise available to the player- other such skills, requiring Skill Points (SP), are also acquirable for a slightly more traditional RPG experience. Using a sword, a staff, a pole-arm, shield, or even bare handed - skills can be trained from meager defenses and attacks to powerful tools against customizable enemy types.


Along with all the regular systems like Elemental effectiveness, Status effects, Leveling and Exploring; you get a Teleport System, this way you don't need to spend hours walking to reach the next town or dungeon. 



Main CharactersLeo Sylphide


 Protagonist; one of many Alchemists, or those that pact with Demons in exchange for the heaven-kept secrets of his art and science. Through the course of the story, Leo attempts to realize his ambitions of the creation of a Homonculus, a dream that leads him to a maelstrom of nightmares beyond his imagining. Soon to face the conquering of his nation by an enemy army, a traitorous King willing to sacrifice his own people and slowly uncovering the selfish conspiracy of the Angels and Demons playing the race of humanity for their own gain.

Alial van Droft: The Demon that formed a covenant with Leo. Trapped in the realm of humans against her will long ago in the ancient war with Angels, she desires to unseal her wings and their magic and return to the underworld- but needs the aid of a human alchemist and their capability for Alchemy. Though first begrudging, the necessity of their mutual cooperation has softened her view of Leo and made him one of few humans she would admit to being fond of.




A mysterious woman with secrets so various and great in number that even she sometimes forgets the truth. More or less adopted by Leo on one of his ventures, her past is slowly follows her back and her true identity and nature comes to the forefront of Alial's and Leo's efforts.







Depending on the amount of donations received from backers, more of our plans for the game can be produced and faster. Here's the layout- from bare-minumum to the deluxe works.



At the minimum of $3000 USD, we can work a continuous production of the game with the following features:

We will put up whatever balance is needed.  It may take us a little longer but you'll get your copy of the Pick3 Dominator!This project was started by a 30 year Wall Street veteran with a financial analysis background, a Russian professor of math, and an experienced VBnet programer.We have been studying the lotteries for years, identifying trends and patterns for most lotteries.Our passed experience with the lottery is the highly popular LotterySlayer program  ( http://lotteryslayer.com ) which is the most detailed statistical analysis program available and suitable for all lottery games,  Pick 3,4,5, Lotto, PowerBall and MegaMillions.  Pick3 Dominator is our first program to actually chose the winning numbers for you.If you just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help:
We all know someone who plays the lottery, get the word out to them.

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Manaverse.com - The technology that Magic: the Gathering is missing</span></p></span><p>Manaverse.com is a social network dedicated to the needs of the Magic: the Gathering community of players and business owners alike. Designed to address several missing aspects of one of the world's most popular games, we want Manaverse.com to become the #1 online asset for Magic players and stores.</p><p>Magic is an exceptional game, 21 years strong and still growing. Outside the game itself however, Magic has fallen behind. As tournament attendance increases and the game's popularity continues to rise, the cracks in the architecture around Magic have become more and more glaring. We believe that Magic can become even greater if the systems around it also continue to evolve. Which is where Manaverse.com comes in.</p><p>From a player's perspective Manaverse.com will: </p><ol>
<li><p>Be a place to connect with players in your local area as well as around the world. </p></li>
<li><p>Offer access to the schedules and information of any LGS (Local Game Store) in your area or anywhere in an intuitive and friendly manner. No more digging through an outdated webpage to find basic info.</p></li>
<li><p>Showcase your achievements and share your story.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep you up to date on the current news and tournaments in the Magic community.</p></li>
<li><p>Offer easy access to the coverage of tournaments and events from anywhere.</p></li>
<li><p>Be a content creation platform. More details below.</p></li>
<li><p>Be free to access. </p></li>
</ol><p>From a business owner's perspective Manaverse.com will:</p><ol>
<li><p>Be a platform to promote your store to highly qualified customers.</p></li>
<li><p>Allow your business to appear in Codex. See below.</p></li>
<li><p>Simplify your social media marketing efforts by automatically pushing your posts on Manaverse.com to other social platforms like Facebook and Twitter.</p></li>
<li><p>Be an easy way to stay connected with your customers and to manage your contact list.</p></li>
<li><p>Offer access to demographic information about the player base as well as more Magic specific info like what format players prefer in your area.</p></li>
<li><p>Offer access to Victory, an end to end system for hosting, organizing, running, and covering tournaments. More details down below.</p></li>

</ol><h3>Our goals for Manaverse.com</h3><p>Our goals for this project are to validate interest and generate buy in from the community to make this site a reality. By contributing to this project you will be directly supporting the creation of the website while also getting some sweet perks at the same time. Specifically, all money pledged will go towards paying for the development and coding of the site as well as producing the branded merchandise.</p><h3>What you will help create and what problems we will solve</h3><p><b>Have you ever wanted to write about Magic, make a video, or record a podcast but don't have a platform to share it?</b> Manaverse.com is a platform where anyone can create content and get published online while simultaneously earning money for their efforts as the quality of the content grows. Manaverse will be a place to build and grow an audience for sharing your experiences and talents that has no gatekeepers, and no one to tell you that your stuff isn't good enough. Validation comes from the community itself. If your content isn't great, no big deal. Use Manaverse’s free resources and tips to improve, and then keep producing and keep getting better at the craft. Soon your audience and your subscribers will grow and you can be topping the charts and earning cash for your content. In addition to Manaverse paying for content, a built in tip jar will make it easy for content creators to be supported directly by their fans and subscribers. <b>Play Magic. Create Content. Get Paid.</b></p><p><b><i>Victory</i>. A new tournament experience.</b> <i>Victory </i>is Manaverse.com's own proprietary application which combines the software used to run and organize tournaments with an online public event page that can be viewed from any account on the network. This instance will enable any store to create coverage of their events and be the location for players to find pairings and standings during a tournament.</p><p><i>Victory </i>will virtually eliminate the need for endless print outs each round or for someone to yell out the names of each pairing. As part of the project, Manaverse.com will be developed and made available as an application for iPhone, Android and Blackberry devices enabling players with Manaverse accounts to receive push notifications to their phones when their pairings are posted. This will allow events to run smoother and faster which is rapidly becoming a bottleneck for larger tournaments.</p><p>Imagine the next Grand Prix where 2000+ players don't have to crowd around a handful of printouts to see which table they were playing at. Also, at the same Grand Prix, imagine being able to check the results in real time while streaming video coverage on the same page and chatting with other players who are also viewing the same event. This is our vision. Game changer.</p><p>As part of an end-to-end solution for organizing tournaments, <i>Victory </i>will also allow stores to receive payment via paypal or credit card when a player preregisters for an event. This will simplify the process of registering players the day of, while also giving the tournament  organizer a better understanding of the turnout they can expect.</p><p><b><i>Codex.</i></b></p><p><b>Have you ever struggled to find information about events in your area? How about simple info like what days your favourite LGS is open?</b> <i>Codex</i> is an intuitive map interface that displays all game stores that are registered with Manaverse.com within a certain radius of the user. It is also a database of information for each business with their name, address, contact info, and weekly schedule. As well as upcoming/current events and their details: price of admission, format, location, prizes, etc. <i>Codex </i>will be an easy and convenient way for players to learn more about the community they play in as well as when they travel for events out of their local area. The more stores that register their information on <i>Codex</i>, the more valuable the software will become for both the businesses and the players that use it.</p><p><i>Codex </i>goes both ways and is just as useful for the stores that are part of the system. By adding your business information to <i>Codex</i>, you are making it easier for your store to be reached by your customers while also cutting down on answering the same mundane questions over and over again.</p><p><i>Codex </i>is more than a map however, it's also a universal event calendar. When an LGS creates their schedule of events on Manaverse.com they are automatically published on <i>Codex </i>and are then displayed on the <i>Codex </i>calendar of each player profile following that store. Each kind of event will have its own unique styling so that people viewing the calendar can see at a glance where and when a local Modern tournament is being held versus an upcoming PTQ or Grand Prix. <i>Codex </i>will intelligently display events and stores to players based on their geographic location and can be customized and filtered to display on different scales and distances. </p><p>Want to find out where and when every PTQ within 500km is being held over the next 4 months? No problem, input your criteria and you can start planning. <i>Codex </i>and <i>Victory </i>are fully integrated. A player will be able to register and pay for an event ahead of time, and then once that's done they can see who else has decided to attend the same tournament. If the event involves travelling, this information can be used to arrange car pooling with local players thus saving the players involved money.</p><p>Larger, more regional tournaments like a PTQ or WMCQ will be featured prominently on the landing page when a player logs in to the site. The landing page will be an excellent place for businesses to promote tournaments and events to local players as well as reach players outside of their region. </p><p></p><h3>Our appeal to you</h3><p>We are not affiliated with Wizards of the Coast and this project is in no way supported by them. We are merely avid players of Magic: the Gathering and former game store owners and want to see it continue to grow and prosper.</p><p>A little about me: I have worn many hats when it comes to Magic. I've played the game since 5th Edition starting with a casual interest and developing all the way up to the competitive scene. I've organized and run multiple tournaments for my local area and understand how difficult it can be to manage events for the Magic community. I have owned and operated a local game store with two friends where Magic was our primary business. Player, tournament organizer, business owner, all this adds up to a wider perspective on the needs of the Magic community which is how the idea for Manaverse came to be.</p><p>As a game that has lead to many friendships and experiences, Magic has been an important part of my life. I feel that in order for Magic to continue to grow and to reach another generation the structures and systems around it need to evolve. I believe that Manaverse.com is the technology that will take Magic into the future.</p><p>As stated above, this campaign is to gauge interest and generate buy in for Manaverse.com with all the funds pledged going towards developing the network and producing the merchandise. This project isn't the only source of funds however. The Manaverse team is fully dedicated to bringing the resources needed to make the network a success. Whether that be time, money, energy, or expertise. What we need is you, the person reading this, to pledge your support and help make our vision a reality.</p><p>We need you to get excited about Magic and about Manaverse. We need you to sport our t-shirts and hoodies. We need you to tell your friends to contribute to the campaign. We need you to spread the word to your local game store and to get them interested in signing up. We need you to share it on Facebook and Twitter using the built in tools on Indiegogo.</p><p>If you're reading this as a fellow Magic player and you think that Manaverse.com sounds pretty cool, we hope you will pledge your support to help bring it to fruition. In exchange for your pledge you will get some excellent merchandise and help spread the word about how Manaverse.com is going to revolutionize the way we play Magic.</p><p>If you're a business owner or a future business owner, we hope this description of what we want to accomplish has convinced you that Manaverse.com can change the way Magic is played and marketed for the better.

See description for more detail about Legendary status for businesses.</p><h3>What does a premium membership get me?</h3><p></p><p><span>Anyone can set up a profile on Manaverse.com for free but stores have the option of upgrading their profile to a premium membership which gives them access to features that aren’t automatically available. For the price of $30/month or $300/year when the site goes live, premium members get access to extended customer relationship management tools, extra visibility on Codex and the front page, become a part of an exclusive store owner forum, and learn effective strategies for growing their business. In addition to that each premium member is awarded $30 in ad credit each month and earns $5 in credit each time they sign up a new player under their store’s unique referral link.</span></p><p>Knowing what your customers want is a great way to know what to sell whether it’s board games, standard format singles, or modern tournaments. The CRM tools are a way for stores to manage the information of their customers and communicate with them as well as access demographic information that can give them insights into what the local community likes. This can help stores know what to provide. It is also a good way to build an email list for use with email campaigns outside of the Manaverse network.</p><p>Premium member’s events posted on Codex are placed more prominently on the homepage of players that follow that store making them more likely to be noticed and interacted with. For larger events this is important in drawing a larger turnout.</p><p>An important aspect of growing a business is learning from others who have been there and accomplished what you are trying to achieve. Every store owner has stories of success and failure they can share that can help other store owners build their own business and avoid common mistakes. By becoming a premium member, store owners gain access to an exclusive group forum where they can share what has worked for them and what hasn’t.

We've had a designer create a few mock ups of what the beta version of Manaverse.com will look like. Below we have a sample newsfeed with a few fictional and not so fictional names and places added in.


Down below is a hypothetical version of Codex, where finding info on game stores anywhere is as easy as clicking on their map location.
And thirdly, we have a sample event page. This is an example of a live tournament being broadcast using Victory from the perspective of a visiting user.

Manaverse.com - The technology that Magic: the Gathering is missingManaverse.com is a social network dedicated to the needs of the Magic: the Gathering community of players and business owners alike. Designed to address several missing aspects of one of the world's most popular games, we want Manaverse.com to become the #1 online asset for Magic players and stores.Magic is an exceptional game, 21 years strong and still growing. Outside the game itself however, Magic has fallen behind. As tournament attendance increases and the game's popularity continues to rise, the cracks in the architecture around Magic have become more and more glaring. We believe that Magic can become even greater if the systems around it also continue to evolve. Which is where Manaverse.com comes in.From a player's perspective Manaverse.com will: 
Be a place to connect with players in your local area as well as around the world. 
Offer access to the schedules and information of any LGS (Local Game Store) in your area or anywhere in an intuitive and friendly manner. No more digging through an outdated webpage to find basic info.
Showcase your achievements and share your story.
Keep you up to date on the current news and tournaments in the Magic community.
Offer easy access to the coverage of tournaments and events from anywhere.
Be a content creation platform. More details below.
Be free to access. 
From a business owner's perspective Manaverse.com will:
Be a platform to promote your store to highly qualified customers.
Allow your business to appear in Codex. See below.
Simplify your social media marketing efforts by automatically pushing your posts on Manaverse.com to other social platforms like Facebook and Twitter.
Be an easy way to stay connected with your customers and to manage your contact list.
Offer access to demographic information about the player base as well as more Magic specific info like what format players prefer in your area.
Offer access to Victory, an end to end system for hosting, organizing, running, and covering tournaments. More details down below.
Simplify and streamline the Magic: the Gathering side of your business.
Have two kinds of memberships, one free and one paid with access to premium features.
Our goals for Manaverse.comOur goals for this project are to validate interest and generate buy in from the community to make this site a reality. By contributing to this project you will be directly supporting the creation of the website while also getting some sweet perks at the same time. Specifically, all money pledged will go towards paying for the development and coding of the site as well as producing the branded merchandise.What you will help create and what problems we will solveHave you ever wanted to write about Magic, make a video, or record a podcast but don't have a platform to share it? Manaverse.com is a platform where anyone can create content and get published online while simultaneously earning money for their efforts as the quality of the content grows. Manaverse will be a place to build and grow an audience for sharing your experiences and talents that has no gatekeepers, and no one to tell you that your stuff isn't good enough. Validation comes from the community itself. If your content isn't great, no big deal. Use Manaverse’s free resources and tips to improve, and then keep producing and keep getting better at the craft. Soon your audience and your subscribers will grow and you can be topping the charts and earning cash for your content. In addition to Manaverse paying for content, a built in tip jar will make it easy for content creators to be supported directly by their fans and subscribers. Play Magic. Create Content. Get Paid.Victory. A new tournament experience. Victory is Manaverse.com's own proprietary application which combines the software used to run and organize tournaments with an online public event page that can be viewed from any account on the network. This instance will enable any store to create coverage of their events and be the location for players to find pairings and standings during a tournament.Victory will virtually eliminate the need for endless print outs each round or for someone to yell out the names of each pairing. As part of the project, Manaverse.com will be developed and made available as an application for iPhone, Android and Blackberry devices enabling players with Manaverse accounts to receive push notifications to their phones when their pairings are posted. This will allow events to run smoother and faster which is rapidly becoming a bottleneck for larger tournaments.Imagine the next Grand Prix where 2000+ players don't have to crowd around a handful of printouts to see which table they were playing at. Also, at the same Grand Prix, imagine being able to check the results in real time while streaming video coverage on the same page and chatting with other players who are also viewing the same event. This is our vision. Game changer.As part of an end-to-end solution for organizing tournaments, Victory will also allow stores to receive payment via paypal or credit card when a player preregisters for an event. This will simplify the process of registering players the day of, while also giving the tournament  organizer a better understanding of the turnout they can expect.Codex.Have you ever struggled to find information about events in your area? How about simple info like what days your favourite LGS is open? Codex is an intuitive map interface that displays all game stores that are registered with Manaverse.com within a certain radius of the user. It is also a database of information for each business with their name, address, contact info, and weekly schedule. As well as upcoming/current events and their details: price of admission, format, location, prizes, etc. Codex will be an easy and convenient way for players to learn more about the community they play in as well as when they travel for events out of their local area. The more stores that register their information on Codex, the more valuable the software will become for both the businesses and the players that use it.Codex goes both ways and is just as useful for the stores that are part of the system. By adding your business information to Codex, you are making it easier for your store to be reached by your customers while also cutting down on answering the same mundane questions over and over again.Codex is more than a map however, it's also a universal event calendar. When an LGS creates their schedule of events on Manaverse.com they are automatically published on Codex and are then displayed on the Codex calendar of each player profile following that store. Each kind of event will have its own unique styling so that people viewing the calendar can see at a glance where and when a local Modern tournament is being held versus an upcoming PTQ or Grand Prix. Codex will intelligently display events and stores to players based on their geographic location and can be customized and filtered to display on different scales and distances. Want to find out where and when every PTQ within 500km is being held over the next 4 months? No problem, input your criteria and you can start planning. Codex and Victory are fully integrated. A player will be able to register and pay for an event ahead of time, and then once that's done they can see who else has decided to attend the same tournament. If the event involves travelling, this information can be used to arrange car pooling with local players thus saving the players involved money.Larger, more regional tournaments like a PTQ or WMCQ will be featured prominently on the landing page when a player logs in to the site. The landing page will be an excellent place for businesses to promote tournaments and events to local players as well as reach players outside of their region. Our appeal to youWe are not affiliated with Wizards of the Coast and this project is in no way supported by them. We are merely avid players of Magic: the Gathering and former game store owners and want to see it continue to grow and prosper.A little about me: I have worn many hats when it comes to Magic. I've played the game since 5th Edition starting with a casual interest and developing all the way up to the competitive scene. I've organized and run multiple tournaments for my local area and understand how difficult it can be to manage events for the Magic community. I have owned and operated a local game store with two friends where Magic was our primary business. Player, tournament organizer, business owner, all this adds up to a wider perspective on the needs of the Magic community which is how the idea for Manaverse came to be.As a game that has lead to many friendships and experiences, Magic has been an important part of my life. I feel that in order for Magic to continue to grow and to reach another generation the structures and systems around it need to evolve. I believe that Manaverse.com is the technology that will take Magic into the future.As stated above, this campaign is to gauge interest and generate buy in for Manaverse.com with all the funds pledged going towards developing the network and producing the merchandise. This project isn't the only source of funds however. The Manaverse team is fully dedicated to bringing the resources needed to make the network a success.

For the price of $30/month or $300/year when the site goes live, premium members get access to extended customer relationship management tools, extra visibility on Codex and the front page, become a part of an exclusive store owner forum, and learn effective strategies for growing their business. In addition to that each premium member is awarded $30 in ad credit each month and earns $5 in credit each time they sign up a new player under their store’s unique referral link.Knowing what your customers want is a great way to know what to sell whether it’s board games, standard format singles, or modern tournaments. The CRM tools are a way for stores to manage the information of their customers and communicate with them as well as access demographic information that can give them insights into what the local community likes. This can help stores know what to provide. It is also a good way to build an email list for use with email campaigns outside of the Manaverse network.Premium member’s events posted on Codex are placed more prominently on the homepage of players that follow that store making them more likely to be noticed and interacted with. For larger events this is important in drawing a larger turnout.An important aspect of growing a business is learning from others who have been there and accomplished what you are trying to achieve. Every store owner has stories of success and failure they can share that can help other store owners build their own business and avoid common mistakes. By becoming a premium member, store owners gain access to an exclusive group forum where they can share what has worked for them and what hasn’t. Cooperation and sharing is essential to growing the Magic community as a whole. By helping other entrepreneurs build their game stores up, the entire Magic community benefits and grows together. The resources found here can help new and experienced store owners become more successful and prosperous than they could isolated on their own. Everyone needs to learn how to run a successful business before they can have one, premium members get access to all the tools and help they need to shorten the learning curve and succeed.Become a Legend.

 Wildlife Survival : Safari Edition 






We want to bring you an exciting game that allows you to roam freely, yet you can complete mini quests to gain bonuses if you wish or even enter a ""Animal team death match"", Capture the tree/water hole"" ""King of the jungle/Savannah"", Catch the prey timed races and much more all through out the sandbox style gaming environment! This is not a pay2win game, old and new players can both survive! If you want to support this game click here now.

          Here are a few key features :
  Massive Animal MMORPG with mini games and optional quests
Choose your animal (unlock more animals as you play) Hunt and stalk your prey, eat other animals, drink and graze while you use up your environments resources and food source and replenish them.
Night and Day Cycles with Weather that affects your animal in many ways
Fatigue from overeating  and food diet prevents most spawn kills and creates a challenging and well balanced game for newbie and veteran players
Stealth Mode for Big Cats
Sleep to gain stamina and increase your health
Animals can Climb, Swim, Run and Leap to navigate their way around their environment to ambush or avoid other animals
Join a group of the same type of animal and communicate to survive attacks



               The Game Plan
    We will be releasing our game on steam greenlight and donating our $100 with
  the hope that it will be well received by the public. However we will not be placing      our game ""on sale"" to ""cash in"" on fans with an unfinished product. We have more    respect for our game and our fanbase and gaming community than that. That is why we are offering the game here at a discounted rate for those who believe in 

our project and want to aid in it's launch. We are excited to see just how far it can go and we truly hope you are too. Thank you for all your the support with our project.

  

      SUPPORT THIS GAME ON INDIEGOGO TO UNLOCK HIDDEN ANIMALS              


  
     WILL IT BE AVAILABLE ON OTHER CONSOLES?
                 We are going to do everything we can to make Wildlife Survival

                 available on all consoles and make it available to all supporters
           at a discounted rate.  Please help us reach our stretch goals below by

           sharing our link on your Facebook,Twitter and Instagram. Thank you! 





                     What We Do With The Funding
We will be using 80% to pay the creators, the coders, the animators and the advertisement on Facebook and Youtube for the game. It is hard work to make a multiplayer online game of this size, so we need your support! So please don't forget to look at what perks we have to offer. Thank you for making our job a little easier.



            WHAT WE DO FOR FANS & CHARITY

10% of the funds and our profit will be given away in our sweepstakes and we will donate the other 10% to help both the endangered animals and people suffering from illness in America and Africa! This is so important so please help us reach our stretch goals. We know you want to help make our world a better place, together we can!

                THE CHEETAH

                 
The fastest land animal in the world, The cheetah's slender, long-legged body is built for speed. Cheetahs are tan in color with black spots all over their bodies. They can also be distinguished from other big cats by their smaller size, spotted coats, small heads, ears and distinctive ""tear stripes"" that stretch from the corner of the eye to the side of the nose.

                                                                              THE LION                 
Lions consume a wide variety of prey, from wildebeest, impala, zebra, giraffe, buffalo and wild hogs to sometimes rhinoceros and hippopotamus. They will also feed on smaller animals such as hares, birds and reptiles. Lions are also known to attack elephants when food is scarce.
     

CROCODILE DEATH ROLL :

   




                
                   WHY WE ARE CROWDFUNDING
We feel that most game companies that do not get a successful launch will not have the kind of fanbase needed to make a steady flow of new releases and patches. Also, we want to offer the chance for both casual gamers and hardcore gamers, a middle ground for an early release and get important feedback from our players.
All of our funders will get all of our future editions and games at a huge discount
to show our appreciation for all of their contributions and helping us succeed!

different Italian and International realities.</p>

the International School of Comics and, in 2014, we added a new service of 3D
sculpture including both the making of and the production of digital artworks!
All of these could be possible thanks to the sculpting experience gained from
several years of work and to the tridimensional sculpting needed for all the
details on the final model.</p>

once you go beyond the basic level, the
more people get involved, the more advanced the options get. The beauty of
crowdfunding projects is that you can go for the safe option of a basic pledge
(our first levels) which gets you a guaranteed set of stuff, provided the
project reaches its minimum funding level.</p>
<p>In our case, this minimum level sits at € 3,000.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can invest a bit more money (with a higher level) and reap the benefits when more people become involved and the
project really takes off. Once certain funding levels are reached (see below),
the return for your initial pledge grows, even though you don’t you have pay
any additional money.</p>
<p>These benefits can include additional models, parts or
substitute parts for the characters, such as better weapons, strongest creature,
sidekick characters or other miscellaneous stuff. </p>
<p>Not all extra goals give you automatic bonuses,
though, some release additional pledging/update options. These can be available
for all pledge levels or just for specific ones, please see below for details.<br/><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/760991/files/20140802033014-RiskandDisclaim.jpg?1406975414"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This is a low-risk campaign, as the majority of the stuff is produced by Greebo Games and will be produced, if we get founded, sooner or later!

Well, some miniatures are
intended as a once-off special on this campaign. And once that is over, they
will not be available from our online store. In fact, some of these sets will
only be available as part of this or future Indiegogo campaigns or at
conventions. The best way to secure your miniature(s) is to pledge the amount
for what you’d like, spread the word among your mates so they get in on it as
well and the project reaches not only its minimum funding level but also some
stretch goals. Once this campaign is over, there’s no secure way to get one of
these models!. </p>

in detail: You tell us what kind of miniature you would like, provided it is a
rat man in shape, roughly human-sized
and fits one of the Hand of death role. We will provide concept sketches with
your likeness or the likeness desired by you. The character will become part of
the team. This means that we will also be giving it a name based on your own or
based on your suggestions. Please keep in mind that the character will have to
fit into the Fantasy world, please don't ask us a Mac5 pilot.</p>
<p>In addition to
your place in gaming history, you will also receive the original of the
character and one Silver (925) model
from it. Of course, the production rights, copyright of the sculpt and any
commercial licence in any way, shape or form shall remain with Greebo Games. So
you're not allowed to make copies of it. You won't have to, mind, because we
will also be supplying you with 10 metal casts of your miniature, which should
be enough to be getting on with for all sorts of gaming-related purposes.</p>

Death your Japanese style Rats
Our goal
is to create a full Japanese style Rats team for Fantasy Football.
Welcome to the Greebo Games
Rats funding campaign! Greebo Games is a well known Italian manufacturer of miniatures, born
for fantasy football. Recently we have started  to produce board games and
different types of fantasy sports game, other than collaborations with
different Italian and International realities.
It is already several years that we create board games, form sculptor with
the International School of Comics and, in 2014, we added a new service of 3D
sculpture including both the making of and the production of digital artworks!
All of these could be possible thanks to the sculpting experience gained from
several years of work and to the tridimensional sculpting needed for all the
details on the final model.
Greebo Games is a factory who keeps an eye both on past and future, giving
you the best product TODAY!Contacts:indiegogo@greebo-games.comFacebookwww.greebo.itTwitterSome examples of the 3D Print ServiceThe project: this year Greebo Games is celebrating the ultimate
technology, 3D sculpture! What’s better to show off our new techniques than
create a whole new team? Everything produced by Greebo Games!
A well projected Japanese Rats Team ready for the pitch right after our
known Waag Saabhi, the Nippo Goblin Team that we launched on our last campaign.
We would like to give you all the necessary to play and have fun with this new
team such as a specific pitch to play on, several markers, Star Players and
coaching staff! Every character will be a discovery and a wonderful sight for
your eyes. The attention to details made from our Senior Character Designer will show you exactly what will be our
finished work, who will born only with YOUR HELP. But we won’t stop here! We
have had a lot of requests for our Tartalar models for Tutatis, so now you have
the chance to get them in a bigger size, perfect for Fantasy Football! Armed
Turtles, Robots, Chimeras, everybody ready to go on a pitch. Is this all? NO!
You fill find even some more miniatures, available ONLY during conventions and
campaigns!
Just one more thing: do not forget to HAVE FUN
following our new Hand of Death campaign!Some examples of painted models by Alessio Cisbani aka WolfbaneAssassins:Bushido's Clan:Throwers:The Rats:Lots of heads to customise your models*: Rat-Oni ( Big Guy )The Hero:Fetz Big Guy hero:The Pitch: if we will unlock this, it will be a rolled up version Prone and Stunned Marker for Oni-Rat:3D projects, printed and casted models for Prone and Stunned Rat-oni markTeam Marker:Block Dices: Custom block dice for the Hand of Death, available as add on  Dice perk The Extras:Tartalar: do you remember the Tutatis' turtle team? Lots of people have been asking us to rework on them in 27 mm scale instead of 10 mm, and here they are!Wartart: We have prepared multy head and multy weapon, so you can arm your Tartalar as you prefer, chose from lots of different weapon and create your own personal team composition! Bow, Sword, Kunay, naked head, band on eyes, bandana, lots of different ways to create your Tartalar! Here are some examplesHere you can see the final result after a 3D print, casted in white metal , primered and inked to show you every details.Wartart :Iron fang is a completely customizable model !Mecha Tartalar (Big Guy)From our last Campaign, the Hand of Death's best friends Waag Saabi Goblin  (Painted by Chiafele ""Axia"" Giuseppe):The EXLUSIVE Bonzo Goblin, available ONLY during campaigns and some festivals:Special WeaponsClan Goblins:Elite Goblins:Ninjas:Oni-Trolls (Big Guys):Dragon Coach and markers:Geisha:*all model where needed will come with one random head. Of course, once you go beyond the basic level, the
more people get involved, the more advanced the options get. The beauty of
crowdfunding projects is that you can go for the safe option of a basic pledge
(our first levels) which gets you a guaranteed set of stuff, provided the
project reaches its minimum funding level.
In our case, this minimum level sits at € 3,000.
Alternatively, you can invest a bit more money (with a higher level) and reap the benefits when more people become involved and the
project really takes off. Once certain funding levels are reached (see below),
the return for your initial pledge grows, even though you don’t you have pay
any additional money.
These benefits can include additional models, parts or
substitute parts for the characters, such as better weapons, strongest creature,
sidekick characters or other miscellaneous stuff. 
Not all extra goals give you automatic bonuses,
though, some release additional pledging/update options. These can be available
for all pledge levels or just for specific ones, please see below for details.This is a low-risk campaign, as the majority of the stuff is produced by Greebo Games and will be produced, if we get founded, sooner or later! The only exception to this is regarding the Tartalar models as they were commissioned to another company. Some of these models can get delayed, changed or deleted. If this occurs, we will be glad to refund you the money you have spent to claim them, or we will convert the amount of money in whatever you want from our catalog.So what happens once the campaign is over? Well, some miniatures are
intended as a once-off special on this campaign. And once that is over, they
will not be available from our online store. In fact, some of these sets will
only be available as part of this or future Indiegogo campaigns or at
conventions. The best way to secure your miniature(s) is to pledge the amount
for what you’d like, spread the word among your mates so they get in on it as
well and the project reaches not only its minimum funding level but also some
stretch goals. Once this campaign is over, there’s no secure way to get one of
these models!.

liable to customs duties outside the European Union.The following

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>Vichitra Games is founded by Rohit Kulkarni in July 2015. 'Vichitra' is a Sanskrit word and the meaning of Vichitra is distinct or out of the box. As the name suggests, the objective of Vichitra Games is to create different games and entertain wide variety of users.</p>
<p>Till today, Vichitra Games has developed few small games of different categories just to get familiar with whole process about gaming world.</p>
<p>A brief about our last games-</p>
<p><strong>Romi and Road Juliet </strong>- It is  a Vichitra (out of the box) game where you will see a Romi running to save his life from a Juliet who is attacking him with her love. The contradiction in game makes it more funny where broken heart indicates life and a full heart received from Juliet ends one life.</p>
<p><strong>Mystery Numbers </strong>- It is a puzzle where you need to solve a magic square which ends in equal sum of all rows, columns and diagonals. This magic square was invented by Great Mathematician Ramanujan. The developer Rohit decoded this logic and developed an unique and addictive puzzle based upon it.</p>
<p>(At the moment Our competition is not with other Game developers who have already developed a lot better games than we did, we are competing with ourselves and making sure that our new game is better than our previous one)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The purpose of our campaign here is to collect funds for our biggest upcoming project 'Mrityu - a terrifying maze'. It is a 3D thriller game. It is dream project of Vichitra game. As we are team of 8 members (4 developers, 2 quality analyst, 1 graphic designer and 1 manager), fully aspired to put our dream project into reality and eager to see audience response for our tremendous and creative efforts.</p>
<p>We are looking for 20,000$ which will be used in paying salaries of our team members, purchasing resources such as graphic assets, music, sound effects etc.</p>
<p>If we get more than our expectation then we will use it to purchase required tools such as pro version of unity, 3D model making tools etc.</p>
<p>Also, all our efforts will be in vain if we fail to advertise our game and unable to reach all users and game lovers. We've learned that its very difficult to sustain without marketing. So honestly speaking, We will also use the funds for marketing of our game.</p>
<p>If we couldn't get our targeted amount then we have decided our priorities as follows:</p>
<p>1. Complete the development with available resources (If we couldn't reach our target)</p>
<p>2. Get more quality resources. (If we are close to our target)</p>
<p>3. Release the game within decided time lines (March last week or April first week of 2017) (If we reach the target)</p>
<p>4. Purchase tools required for game development (If we cross our target)</p>
<p>5. Spend more on marketing (If we cross our target)</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Everyone who contributes in our campaign will get promo codes of all our previous games so that you can play it without the trouble of advertisements along with the promo code of Mrityu once it is live in the stores.</p>
<p>You will get other benefits as per your contribution. Please check the Perks section for details. We are offering promo codes of our previous games to every one who contributes, but there is a limit to generate number of promo codes per app. Once this limit is crossed we can make the paid app free for certain period for our contributors.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution is very important to us, since this project means a lot to our team and therefore we decided to use this platform. We've learned the basics of game development process without expecting anything by releasing our first few games, and now we believe that we can develop much better games if we get enough support. With every new project we will learn new things and we will improve ourselves in the next project.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we could not reach our target then there is a risk of not able to release the game in given time lines.</p>
<p>Funding is the challenge, we need to overcome this challenge by trying to earn from our other services which may impact the 'Mrityu' project time lines. Even though our priority is 'Mrityu', we can not run away from the bitter truth of required fundings !</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know everyone can not contribute to every project, but money is not the only thing with which you can help us. You can still download our games which are available in the stores. You can follow us on facebook, twiiter, youtube etc. Share it with your friends.</p>
<p>It will increase our motivation !</p>

Everyone who contributes in our campaign will get promo codes of all our previous games so that you can play it without the trouble of advertisements along with the promo code of Mrityu once it is live in the stores.
You will get other benefits as per your contribution. Please check the Perks section for details. We are offering promo codes of our previous games to every one who contributes, but there is a limit to generate number of promo codes per app. Once this limit is crossed we can make the paid app free for certain period for our contributors.

The Impact
Your contribution is very important to us, since this project means a lot to our team and therefore we decided to use this platform. We've learned the basics of game development process without expecting anything by releasing our first few games, and now we believe that we can develop much better games if we get enough support. With every new project we will learn new things and we will improve ourselves in the next project.
 

Risks & Challenges
If we could not reach our target then there is a risk of not able to release the game in given time lines.
Funding is the challenge, we need to overcome this challenge by trying to earn from our other services which may impact the 'Mrityu' project time lines. Even though our priority is 'Mrityu', we can not run away from the bitter truth of required fundings !

Other Ways You Can Help
We know everyone can not contribute to every project, but money is not the only thing with which you can help us. You can still download our games which are available in the stores. You can follow us on facebook, twiiter, youtube etc. Share it with your friends.
It will increase our motivation !",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Pop Rockz World is an iOS multiplayer game that simulates the music entertainment industry.</p>
<p><img alt=""Pop Rockz World "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.swagsoft.com/indiegogo/prw/prw-screen.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""This is where your road to stardom begins!""/></p>
<p>Players start off virtually unknown in Pop Rockz World but with talent, hard work and a bucketful of luck, you will slowly climb your way up the fame ladder. Along the long ardous road to stardom, you will have to bask in parks and take on gigs in pubs. When you finally gain some fanship, you will be invited to perform at TV shows and grand stadiums to sell-out crowds. With fame comes money, and you can gradually afford snazzier threads, buy pretty instruments, drive fancy cars and stay in swanky apartments.</p>
<p>And on the path to fame and glory, you must continually pick up new skills to improve your performances, release singles to increase your star power and pit yourself against other players in the Pop Rockz Arena to prove who’s better than who!</p>
<p><span>But once you become a star—if ever you do— will you continue to bask in your glory with millions of wild, screaming fans or will you sink back down to oblivion? If that happens, tough luck -- that’s life in the Pop Rockz World! </span></p>

<p>It's not truly the music industry without performances. In fact, it's the lifeblood of the industry itself, where new talents get discovered and super stars exalt to god-like status on stage. Players start their performances from the humble park and gradually unlock more venues.</p>

<p>Players can produce and release music singles to boost their popularity and gain fans. We designed this such that the Player will go through a production process not unlike the real thing - from music production to song writing through to sound engineering and marketing the single.</p>
<p>What's more, after the release of a single, the Player will have a chance of winning an award, gaining loads of fans and even receiving a contract from a major record label to produce an album!</p>
<p><strong>Music School</strong></p>

<p><strong>What We Need the Money For</strong></p>
<p>As you can see from the screenshots, we are well into production and we are looking to launch the game within 2012.</p>
<p>We are looking to raise $25,000 for the following -</p>
<p>Marketing - Marketing an iOS game is become increasingly more difficult and expensive. Most of the top spots in the iTunes store are dominated by big companies like Game Loft and Electronic Arts who simply have the bucks to fling into marketing. However, we are smart marketers and we know how to attract eyeballs with a fraction of the budget they have. Our previous game - <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lamebo-vs.-zombies/id426401349?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lamebo VS. Zombies</a> - was marketed on a shoestring budget but shot up to the Top 20 most downloaded in the US market and several other stores. We are marketing whizs who really know how to market our game. But low budget doesn't mean no budget. We still need a reasonable amount of marketing dollars to give Pop Rockz World the initial push it needs to get noticed and go viral. Please help us give the big boys a run for their money by supporting us.</p>

<p>Creating More Content and Features - One of the best ways to reward our Players, keep our Players coming back and to attract new Players is to continually roll out new content and improving our features. We have a list of addon content such as clothing, instruments, cars and more to roll out and we just need the funds to produce them.</p>
<p>Music - As music is a very important component in this music themed game, we would like to license great music to insert into the game. </p>
<p>Game Testing - We would like to hire professional game testers to test our game to see if the balancing is well done, so that our Players have a good experience playing our game.</p>
<p>Our priority would be marketing the game to get some traction. If we do not reach our entire funding goal, we will dedicate 70% of the funds towards marketing and the rest towards game testing and balancing. We will then reinvest part of our profits into developing more content and licensing better music.</p>

is a 2D top-down view action game developed by the indipendent Orichalcum Games. Your objective is to survive a terrible sickness in an unknown maze and find an explanation for
your imprisonment.The story
The story is very simple, in the beginning at least.
You find yourself imprisoned in an unknown dungeon: you don't know where you
are, why you are there nor who put you in. Your only goal seems to be finding
an exit but soon you will discover other humans populate the dark maze,
clueless as much as you; some will be helpful, some will fight against you.
Everyone you encounter got sick, and dangerous. Finding your way will not be easy at all.

<p><b>Q: </b>How ASO is safer than other email and cloud clients?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A: </b>Traditional email and Cloud
providers like uses their own server in a place full of random people.  The chances are extremely high of your
important files falling into somebody else’s hands. With AirSpaceOne you have
your own private server that all your emails are sent to that is in the privacy
of your own home or office only offering the people you want to have access to
it. </p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Do I need to continuously run
my server to get emails? If so, what happens if the power goes out?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A:</b> Yes, you need to continuously
run your server to get emails. The server should be connected to a power source
at all times in an uninterrupted way. But do not worry, AirSpaceOne servers
have a built in lithium battery that won’t let the servers experience any down
time due to power shortages. The lithium built in battery allows up to 8 hours
of video play back. </p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Is there any monthly or
reoccurring fees?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A:</b> Our email and cloud service is
absolutely free. There is only a one time purchase cost for your own private
AirSpaceOne server, and you can choose different plans listed in the “Perks
Section”. </p>
<p><b><b>Q:</b></b> Can AirSpaceOne have multiple
accounts set up on one single server?</p>
<p><b><b>A: </b></b>Yes, You can set up to 5 accounts
per server.(We are working to add more accounts)</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Why do we need funds?</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>A:</b> On Average we have to invest
50+ hours per week to get the project completed before December 2013. Funding
helps ensure that we reach our deadline as well as making any enhancements
possible.  Also, funding helps with
marketing expenses to promote the product and ensure the first set of

</blockquote><h3>The beginning of the end</h3><p>The Town is out there, silent. The Priest, The Mayor, The Doctor and seven others citizens had met to congratulate the Butcher, for he is going to marry the fairest lady of them all. Then the storm came and they decided to stay for the night. </p><p>In the morning they found out they were the only inhabitants of their Town. </p><p>Something happened. Something bad, and it was up to them to find out what it was...and how they could come out of it alive. It was not going to be easy.</p><p></p><p>Time to regroup, time to start making choices…</p><p><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What kind of game is this?</span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In Lost Town you can try to find answers to the many mysteries  lying around while trying to keep alive as many survivors as possible. The game is inspired by TV shows like </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Lost</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The walking Dead, Jericho </i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and the masterful Neil Gaiman narrative. Also, the game tries to capture the mood of some very touching music pieces like Pixies’ </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Where is my mind</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">, Gary Jules’ </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Mad World</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> and Dead Island trailer song </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Breathe Me</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> by Sia.</span><br/></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p>It’s a survival story, with moments of action, moments of horror and moments of psychological tension.

There will be many. <i>Many</i>.

There will be a minimum of 30 locations, more if stretch goals are met. </span><br/></p><p>Each location will contain hazards, dangers, tools and a little piece of truth hidden somewhere in it.

Each character will also have different stats, helping them in some choices, hindering in others. </p><p>Every single character will open special choices in determined locations, so you can never know what will happen to the character you are leading in the place you are going.</p><p>Finally, there will be some special characters only available if some conditions are met...</p><p><i>Now, a big smile all of you...</i></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/487080/files/20140406010141-Personaggi2.jpg?1396771301"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 480px;""/></p><br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>Single and Multi player</h3><p>Lost Town will be playable both as a single player or as a multi player experience.</p><p>In multi player mode, you will be able to play with up to other 3 players for a total of up to 4 players. Each day, each player will choose a character and explore one location. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Each night, the group will make together choices about what is happening. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Each player needs one copy of the game, but you can pick the <i><b>""Party of Four!"" </b></i>or <b><i>""Party of Four Deluxe!""</i></b> perks to get 4 copies of the game for your group of friends. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">You will be free to play with specific friends or with strangers, and you will be able to invite your friends to play the game with you. You will also be able to play with IA companions if none is available for the pacing you desire.</span></p><p>In single player, the scheme is the same but you will make night choices alone. The experience of gaming will be unhindered by playing alone, it will just be different.</p><p>The game accounts for how many players there are and reacts accordingly.</p><p>In no case you will be able to see who is choosing which character, but you will know which characters have been chosen. You will not know even if you play with friends: we think it will be far more immersive that way, keeping everybody guessing similar to what happens, from a mood perspective, in <i>Dark Souls</i> games. For the same reason, no messaging system will be implemented. </p><p>Yes, you can phone or text your friend if you want. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">But you shouldn't and your karma will be strained. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The multi player component will thus have two aspects: first, your story will be influenced by the choices the other players take and what they find in the Town, second your story will go in the direction you and the other players decide with the night choices while evaluating the evidence you found in your locations' exploring.</span></p><p>The locations, instead, will be individually explored so you don't have to wait for anyone in making your choices at your own pace.</p><i>The Graveyard: are you sure you want to be there alone?</i><p><i></i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/437830/files/20140316144050-Cimitero.jpg?1395006050"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">What does asynchronous mean?</span><br/>
</h3><p></p><p>It means that the group will be able to proceed in the game at the pace they set. There will be the possibility to decide how long each game day will last, so every player will know how much time they have to explore their own location.</p><p>Basically, it's how long the Night voting moment will wait for all players to have finished their choices.</p><p>When the time will has expired, the game will make the remaining choices for the late players, so nobody is left behind.</p><p>For instance, say you set the duration at one real time day. Player 1 ends his exploration at noon, player 2 in the afternoon, player 3 in the evening. Player 4 has not ended his exploration at night because he had to stay at work overnight. </p><p>As the group decided they are fine with waiting for one day maximum, the game engine will make choices for Player 4 so voting can happen at night. The same will happen if someone does not vote in the chosen timeframe.</p><p>As each group will be free to set a comfortable day duration, you'll be able to go as quick or slow as you feel like.</p><p>Of course, if you are playing alone, none of this matters.</p><p><i>Look at The Bodyguard: does he look like someone who's going to wait forever?</i></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/487092/files/20140406015107-WP-LOSTTOWN-BODYGUARD.jpg?1396774267"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The paper version</h3><p></p>Lost Town was born as a party game, this is why we decided to make a multi player game instead of a solo one. The paper game will be a product for you to enjoy with a group of friends. It will be similar, but far simpler, to a role playing game where up to eight players drive the story, and one master-mind plays <i>against </i>them, leading the story in the fair but undoubtedly brutal direction the players chose… <p></p><p>The game engine will be similar to the one used in the App, based on a simple mechanic of action resolution through a combination of character stats, character assets, random draws from a standard 54 card deck and some tactical choice: each player has some ace up his sleeve, so to speak. </p><p>The party game will be available both as PDF and as paper product, as well as in various e-book formats. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The paper form will not be a game book: it will be the party game, both in paper and e-book form.  </span></p><p>It will be made up by two booklets: a player’s guide including the characters and their stat cards and a Narrator guide including a detailed <i>how to play</i> guide, all the locations and special rules and scoring system. </p><p>The paper game will require a couple months more than the App one, as we want to focus on the digital version first.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/437318/files/20140316101943-LOGO_con_pagine.png?1394990383"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>What do I get for backing this game now?</h3><p>Your help in funding this game is vital to us so we want to reward it appropriately.</p><p></p><p><b><i>First, value</i></b>: at all reward (or perk) levels above the first one you will get the full App experience and all of the characters which we’ll ever implement in the game: in the retail version on the digital stores 6 characters will be part of the initial package, while others will be sold separately. You'll get instead 11 minimum including a special one, effectively getting the full game at least 40% cheaper than the comparable value on the stores. Yes, the basic game will cost (a bit) less in the stores, but everybody will need to buy additional characters one by one. Also, no special character for them. The App will be in Android or IOS format, more on other formats below.</p><p><b><i>Second</i></b><b><i>, exclusive</i></b>: you will get one very special character exclusive to Indiegogo backers: The Specialist. He's tough, he's armed and he knows what he's doing. This special character is not part of the starting group of survivors, but you will get access to his locations to try and recruit him in your group. <b>This character will not be available out of this Indiegogo campaign and possibly further crowdfunding campaigns</b>, if ever there will be more, which at the moment isn't planned.</p><p><b><i>Third</i></b><b><i>, respect</i></b>: you will have the possibility to ask for a complete explanation of the “true” ending just by sending us an email: we will send the answer back to you starting one month after publication of the game on the first store. We consider extremely important that all of the happenings in the Lost Town have a solid explanation and we don’t want you to miss it in case you don’t have the time to find it out by gaming. Which is of course what we suggest… but you are the boss here and you deserve answers, if you so desire.</p><p><b><i>Fourth, more value</i></b>: depending on the reward level you choose you will also get a series of other valuables, such as the paper game to live the Lost Town experience at the gaming table with your friends, or the original soundtrack or customized Lost Town deck for playing the paper game… or all of it together! For the ones that really want to invest in our game, there's plenty of choices to impact on some of the game elements, too, or to get away with some personalized reward.</p><p><b><i>Last but not least, you will help bringing this game to life, knowing that you supported the creation of something new and, we really believe, special.</i></b></p><p><i>The Specialist in all his glory:</i></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/496649/files/20140409135154-WP-LOSTTOWN-Specialist-RED.jpg?1397076714"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2></h2><p><i>Here you can find a summary of the Perks you can get in this campaign:</i></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/507962/files/20140414134227-PERKS_tabella.jpg?1397508147"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><h2>Why we need your support</h2><p></p><p></p><p>Lost Town is a pure indie game. We’re self-funding the development, art, writing, and promotion from our own pockets. It’s a big work for a small group of people, some of which full time employed. </p><p>The goal amount we ask is about 50% of what we need to fully develop the game, but we'll put in the rest ourselves if need be.</p><p>Our ambition is to fund an independent entertainment studio to bring to life the many peculiar ideas we developed in our years as storytellers and gamers (more of that in our bios). As abused as it may sounds, this is a labor of love, and crowdfunding is our way to prove that it can be done, that our stories deserve a public. </p><p>We want Lost Town to be the best debut we can obtain, and that’s where your support will be invaluable to help pay for professional editing, software and hardware needs, art, licenses, testing, production values and of course your perks! </p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>This sounds quite complex!</h3><p>That is because, to our knowledge, such a game has never been done before. The structure of the game is indeed complex but it will be very easy to navigate.</p><p>You will be able to read through the story like in a traditional game book, making choices, facing hazards, trying to survive. The staggering amount of different hidden variables is such that replay value will be very high, higher than in any game book you may ever have read: it's a promise.</p><p><i>The Train Station: it's quite complex, but you won't perceive it initially:</i></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/496614/files/20140409133755-Stazione_ferroviaria.jpg?1397075875"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Kicking it Forward!</h3><p></p><p>Lost Town adheres to the Kicking It Forward system. Yes, we can use this on Indiegogo, we got approval both from InXile and from Indiegogo. To explain it with the words from the legendary Brian Fargo, the inventor: <i>""Once a project in this program has become profitable, the creator is going to spend this 5% profit, which is their own money, on whatever (crowdfunding) projects they want to support... Ultimately, this is an honor system.""</i></p>Well, we think it's a great idea, we are men of honor, we choose to do this. We'll tell what we'll sponsor this way.

The beginning of the endThe Town is out there, silent. The Priest, The Mayor, The Doctor and seven others citizens had met to congratulate the Butcher, for he is going to marry the fairest lady of them all. Then the storm came and they decided to stay for the night. In the morning they found out they were the only inhabitants of their Town. Something happened. Something bad, and it was up to them to find out what it was...and how they could come out of it alive. It was not going to be easy.Time to regroup, time to start making choices…What kind of game is this?In Lost Town you can try to find answers to the many mysteries  lying around while trying to keep alive as many survivors as possible. The game is inspired by TV shows like Lost, The walking Dead, Jericho and the masterful Neil Gaiman narrative. Also, the game tries to capture the mood of some very touching music pieces like Pixies’ Where is my mind, Gary Jules’ Mad World and Dead Island trailer song Breathe Me by Sia.It’s a survival story, with moments of action, moments of horror and moments of psychological tension. At the end of a desperate week the resulting story will be yours, and yours alone. It will all depend on the choices you and your team made, the locations you explored and the dangers you faced.At endgame, you will be able to compare with other players worldwide to see how far from the truth you have gone.The first version of the characters' sheet:Weekisode of the week: Episode 1, The SurvivorIn order to promote our creative project, we prepared a series of micro episodes to offer some quick brush strokes, an idea of the personality of some of the survivors before the crisis.We’ll propose to you one of the characters each week until the end of the Indiegogo campaign. You are free to share it anyway you like, actually you are encouraged to do so. At the end of week 2 we'll send out a survey to give you, the first backers, the possibility to choose the final Weekisode character: be an early backer so you can make your vote count!We hope you will like the idea and the mood of our small stories inside the main story, please keep in mind these are made to give you a taste of the mood of the Town: the final game, as described in this very page, will be a game book, not a movie or a comic book. Let the story begin, starting with our first character...GameplayYou will choose one out of many characters and you will decide if you want to play alone or with up to three other friends… or strangers. The game is divided in seven long days, each day marked by some major happening. Each day is a turn of variable duration, up to the players to decide at the beginning of each game.During the days, each player will go out and explore one of more than 30 locations of the Town in which the characters will discover terrifying truths about the Town, themselves and the world they live in. Exploration is done via reading parts of the story and deciding what to do when different possibilities are available. There will be many. Many. Characters will have different personal stories, different peculiar special abilities and different stats to overcome the difficulties they will encounter.Each evening (again, game time) the party will gather at their shelter and each player will see a synthesis of what happened to the others. It will be then time to decide what is really happening, coming one step closer to the inevitable end... well, one of them. Group decisions will happen via voting different possibilities, which in turn will depend on what the characters found out during their explorations.By now you know we like choices: there will be 21 endings in the game, some good, some bad, one only the true one. And no, we don't think it's something you guessed already!The Priest is one of the (10 to 16 ) characters you can choose:What does SANDBOX mean?It means that you will be free to choose which location to explore from the map of the town freely, scrolling the map and deciding where your character is going.Some locations will be available only for certain characters, while others may become explorable only under specific circumstances, but most of them will be available since the beginning of the game.The locations will play an important role in the story, as they are the places where each player will be able to play individually and make individual choices. There will be a minimum of 30 locations, more if stretch goals are met. Each location will contain hazards, dangers, tools and a little piece of truth hidden somewhere in it. Somewhere deep.Here you can find a shot of our map, it will be fully zoomable and scrollable:A matter of character(s)Even if you will be able to play with a maximum of other 3 players you will be able to choose between at least ten iconic characters, more if stretch goals are met, each with individual stories and special locations available only when they are in the team.You will be allowed to change characters each game day or if your character dies: the character failed, the body count increases, the story moves on… until they all die, or some of them succeed in reaching the final day and facing the ending the group deserved.Each character has its own public story, a more personal story revealed only when the character is chosen and some shady secret to be found in the Town. They will also have a special and very peculiar ability, for instance The Priest thanks to his Guidance from Above will be able to go back one choice once per day. Each character will also have different stats, helping them in some choices, hindering in others. Every single character will open special choices in determined locations, so you can never know what will happen to the character you are leading in the place you are going.Finally, there will be some special characters only available if some conditions are met...Now, a big smile all of you...Single and Multi playerLost Town will be playable both as a single player or as a multi player experience.In multi player mode, you will be able to play with up to other 3 players for a total of up to 4 players. Each day, each player will choose a character and explore one location. Each night, the group will make together choices about what is happening. Each player needs one copy of the game, but you can pick the ""Party of Four!"" or ""Party of Four Deluxe!"" perks to get 4 copies of the game for your group of friends. You will be free to play with specific friends or with strangers, and you will be able to invite your friends to play the game with you. You will also be able to play with IA companions if none is available for the pacing you desire.In single player, the scheme is the same but you will make night choices alone. The experience of gaming will be unhindered by playing alone, it will just be different.The game accounts for how many players there are and reacts accordingly.In no case you will be able to see who is choosing which character, but you will know which characters have been chosen. You will not know even if you play with friends: we think it will be far more immersive that way, keeping everybody guessing similar to what happens, from a mood perspective, in Dark Souls games. For the same reason, no messaging system will be implemented. Yes, you can phone or text your friend if you want. But you shouldn't and your karma will be strained. The multi player component will thus have two aspects: first, your story will be influenced by the choices the other players take and what they find in the Town, second your story will go in the direction you and the other players decide with the night choices while evaluating the evidence you found in your locations' exploring.The locations, instead, will be individually explored so you don't have to wait for anyone in making your choices at your own pace.The Graveyard: are you sure you want to be there alone?
What does asynchronous mean?
It means that the group will be able to proceed in the game at the pace they set. There will be the possibility to decide how long each game day will last, so every player will know how much time they have to explore their own location.Basically, it's how long the Night voting moment will wait for all players to have finished their choices.When the time will has expired, the game will make the remaining choices for the late players, so nobody is left behind.For instance, say you set the duration at one real time day. Player 1 ends his exploration at noon, player 2 in the afternoon, player 3 in the evening. Player 4 has not ended his exploration at night because he had to stay at work overnight. As the group decided they are fine with waiting for one day maximum, the game engine will make choices for Player 4 so voting can happen at night. The same will happen if someone does not vote in the chosen timeframe.As each group will be free to set a comfortable day duration, you'll be able to go as quick or slow as you feel like.Of course, if you are playing alone, none of this matters.Look at The Bodyguard: does he look like someone who's going to wait forever?The paper versionLost Town was born as a party game, this is why we decided to make a multi player game instead of a solo one. The paper game will be a product for you to enjoy with a group of friends. It will be similar, but far simpler, to a role playing game where up to eight players drive the story, and one master-mind plays against them, leading the story in the fair but undoubtedly brutal direction the players chose… The game engine will be similar to the one used in the App, based on a simple mechanic of action resolution through a combination of character stats, character assets, random draws from a standard 54 card deck and some tactical choice: each player has some ace up his sleeve, so to speak. The party game will be available both as PDF and as paper product, as well as in various e-book formats. The paper form will not be a game book: it will be the party game, both in paper and e-book form.  It will be made up by two booklets: a player’s guide including the characters and their stat cards and a Narrator guide including a detailed how to play guide, all the locations and special rules and scoring system. The paper game will require a couple months more than the App one, as we want to focus on the digital version first.What do I get for backing this game now?Your help in funding this game is vital to us so we want to reward it appropriately.First, value: at all reward (or perk) levels above the first one you will get the full App experience and all of the characters which we’ll ever implement in the game: in the retail version on the digital stores 6 characters will be part of the initial package, while others will be sold separately. You'll get instead 11 minimum including a special one, effectively getting the full game at least 40% cheaper than the comparable value on the stores. Yes, the basic game will cost (a bit) less in the stores, but everybody will need to buy additional characters one by one. Also, no special character for them. The App will be in Android or IOS format, more on other formats below.Second, exclusive: you will get one very special character exclusive to Indiegogo backers: The Specialist. He's tough, he's armed and he knows what he's doing. This special character is not part of the starting group of survivors, but you will get access to his locations to try and recruit him in your group. This character will not be available out of this Indiegogo campaign and possibly further crowdfunding campaigns, if ever there will be more, which at the moment isn't planned.Third, respect: you will have the possibility to ask for a complete explanation of the “true” ending just by sending us an email: we will send the answer back to you starting one month after publication of the game on the first store. We consider extremely important that all of the happenings in the Lost Town have a solid explanation and we don’t want you to miss it in case you don’t have the time to find it out by gaming. Which is of course what we suggest… but you are the boss here and you deserve answers, if you so desire.Fourth, more value: depending on the reward level you choose you will also get a series of other valuables, such as the paper game to live the Lost Town experience at the gaming table with your friends, or the original soundtrack or customized Lost Town deck for playing the paper game… or all of it together! For the ones that really want to invest in our game, there's plenty of choices to impact on some of the game elements, too, or to get away with some personalized reward.Last but not least, you will help bringing this game to life, knowing that you supported the creation of something new and, we really believe, special.The Specialist in all his glory:Here you can find a summary of the Perks you can get in this campaign:Why we need your supportLost Town is a pure indie game. We’re self-funding the development, art, writing, and promotion from our own pockets. It’s a big work for a small group of people, some of which full time employed. The goal amount we ask is about 50% of what we need to fully develop the game, but we'll put in the rest ourselves if need be.Our ambition is to fund an independent entertainment studio to bring to life the many peculiar ideas we developed in our years as storytellers and gamers (more of that in our bios). As abused as it may sounds, this is a labor of love, and crowdfunding is our way to prove that it can be done, that our stories deserve a public. We want Lost Town to be the best debut we can obtain, and that’s where your support will be invaluable to help pay for professional editing, software and hardware needs, art, licenses, testing, production values and of course your perks! This sounds quite complex!That is because, to our knowledge, such a game has never been done before. The structure of the game is indeed complex but it will be very easy to navigate.You will be able to read through the story like in a traditional game book, making choices, facing hazards, trying to survive. The staggering amount of different hidden variables is such that replay value will be very high, higher than in any game book you may ever have read: it's a promise.The Train Station: it's quite complex, but you won't perceive it initially:Kicking it Forward!Lost Town adheres to the Kicking It Forward system. Yes, we can use this on Indiegogo, we got approval both from InXile and from Indiegogo. To explain it with the words from the legendary Brian Fargo, the inventor: ""Once a project in this program has become profitable, the creator is going to spend this 5% profit, which is their own money, on whatever (crowdfunding) projects they want to support... Ultimately, this is an honor system.""Well, we think it's a great idea, we are men of honor, we choose to do this. We'll tell what we'll sponsor this way. Once again, this will happen only after the game is profitable and on the stores.                                                                                              LanguagesLost Town will be available in English and Italian. We'd really like to add Spanish language but we'll only do so if the related stretch goal is reached: we want the final version to be professionally proofread and edited, and while we speak Spanish fluently we cannot commit to the cost of the quality check you deserve with the base funding goal. Spread the word, share the campaign and help us make it in Spanish too!TabletsOf course! The game will be optimized for tablet gaming too, obvious to us but better to spell it out clearly.Will I be able to play the game on IOS, PC or AMAZON FIREs (TV and Tablets)?The game will be developed first for standard Android (all recent versions, actual and future).As the ecosystem is very similar, and as Amazon is making things easy for developers, we'll also develop the game for Kindle Fire, Fire HD and Fire TV (yes!).Finally, the game will also be developed for IOS, but please remember that the versions will be developed in sequence, Android first, Amazon second and IOS third, we estimate a couple months per conversion.The version you are reserving here on Indiegogo is the ""standard Android"" one or the IOS one, your choice: at the moment, these are the systems which we should be able to distribute to international backers. Yes, we know there have been issues with IOS distribution before for crowdfunded projects but we made our questions and we are confident we can do it.If it will be possible at the time of game completion, we WILL allow backers to choose Amazon also, but this is not a promise as it will depend on Amazon policies.Anyway, the game will be well worth the pain, we promise.The Mechanic will help us distribute the game. Stretch GoalsIf we exceed our funding goal we will aim higher: for any stretch goal reached, we will add something special to Lost Town for everybody to enjoy. Share this page, let words fly about the game and you will benefit from a better game yourself!Also, we'll include some stretch goal not related to money but to Facebook shares as these are a potent way to spread the news.                                          Let's start with a free oneand here we go with the first addition to your basic party...another one joins the party......a new very special character...                                                       ...getting Latin...       ...and there will be more if these are reached...Add-OnIf you like the Lost Town universe, you may want to get some extra goodies independently from your Perk level. If you so choose, just add the amount here below to choose your add-on and we'll provide it for you, but remember to add a note in the donation so we know what you want:5 € - 7 $ - 4 £  for becoming a decisionmaker: we'll ask for your opinion when we are unsure about something, we estimate a total of 4 surveys minimum;20 € - 28 $ - 17 £ for the special playing cards deck customized for the Lost Town paper party game (but any standard deck will do, don't worry, it's for collectors).

Risks and challengesThis is an ambitious project. It’s the first time, in our honest knowledge, that an App game book includes multi player elements so central to the story, together with a complex sandbox story. The main challenges we see is timing: that is why we ask for community support in order to speed thing up by outsourcing non vital parts of the project, and of course the fact that being a first time, risks are present: that is why we are putting all of our energies in making this game the best it can be.There are safe areas in the Town, like the group's shelterYour ideasOf course we welcome your suggestions on Lost Town but please don't propose them if you are going to claim rights in them: be aware that if we use them you won't be able to claim that you own bits of the game.

<li><div align=""left"">I am a graduate of game design and environment art (Masters), and after being in various jobs and projects for a while, I am ready to create something of my own.</div></li> <li>I have worked on my game ""Modulated"" for a long time as a side project while I studied and worked. But it has reached a point where I need to work at it as a full job to complete it, and that means covering living expenses.</li>
<li>If I can get the funding needed, I will see to it that the game gets all the attention it needs and gets developed quickly and efficiently.<br/>
</li>
<li>Without <i>your</i> help, this game will probably never be finished and be forgotten, a new indie development business in a country which sorely needs more love for the art of video games will never get established. <br/>
</li>
<li>It is about so much more than just the game.</li>

 Modulated is a Mech Combat simulator.<br/>It's a game where you put together your own mech, and try it out against other mechs.<br/>The game focuses a lot on planned tactical and strategic movement rather than neccesarily twitch reflexes.<br/><br/>It is currently being developed for PC using the Unreal Development kit, but I am willing to look at spreading the game for more platforms should the game be successful and the platform be viable after the game has been released.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/824741/files/20140831130119-DDL.jpg?1409515279"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>The goals of the game are as follows:<br/><ul>
<li>Customization. Not only will you be able to customize over 18 different parts of your mech, you will also be able to customize its paintjob to create your unique style.</li>
<li>Arena. Herein lies the core game, bring your creation to various arenas to fight for different prizes.<br/>
</li>
<li>Rivals. Mechs will have recognizable names, tactics and setups, each having different ways to be defeated. You will remember who destroyed your mech last time, and be ready for revenge.<br/>
</li>
<li>Tournaments. Join large tournaments ending in a single duel against the top mech, for greater and unique rewards.<br/>
</li>
<li>Rankings. As you work your way up, compare your statistics and fighting prowess to the other mech pilots in the game.<br/>
</li>
<li>Challenges. As your name gets more known, pilots will start challenging you to duels where you will fight for parts of each other's mechs.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now these are the base goals of the game, there are a lot more features that I would love to implement and that the game has been designed to support.<br/>These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research tree. Develop your own parts by researching and crafting from scraps gained from your defeated opponents.<br/>
</li>
<li>Exploration, explore the world, scavenge for unique parts and fight bandit mechs and ancient, collossus mechs roaming the world. Trade with and fight for various factions.<br/>
</li>
<li>Multiplayer support: Test your design against your friends!</li>
<li>And more..!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><i>However, </i>these features will take of funding (or rather, time) to implement, and will only be doable as stretch goals, or should the game be financially successful after it's release.</p>
<p>Yes, that's right, I wish to continue to add to the game and improve it after it's ""done"".<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>You can find a <i><b>very, </b></i>early alpha at <a href=""http://www.desura.com/games/modulated"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Desura! </a></p>Please keep in mind that it is a mere skeleton of the game, with no progress, a lot of placeholder art, and lots of bugs.<br/>

When you are working on something full time, regardless of how little expenses the project itself has, there are expenses to cover.<br/><ul>
<li>First of all, living costs. Most of the funding will go to cover living costs during the development period, however, I will be living very cheaply, and the funds will only cover cheap, basic food, shelter and power, in order to maximize the potential of the funds, and so that you don't feel I am spending the money on myself.<br/>Think of it as funds for development time.<br/>
</li>
<li>Safety net. There will always be unexpected expenses and opportunities, a little extra of the fund goes to this.<br/>
</li>
<li>Extras. And at last there is a bit dedicated to things like covering the perks, some occasional outsourcing to things I cannot cover myself, like voiceover and music, and help that may speed up the process.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>If the complete goal isn't reached, the game will get developed as far as the funds go, the game will then be released as an early access version for sale (perks will still be valid!), and the game will continue to be developed as long as sales and support cover continued development.<br/>

</div></div>","(I apologize in advance for the terrible commentary in the two videos, I am a developer, not a voiceactor or commentator) 
 
Hi, my name is Magnus Ekeli.
I am a graduate of game design and environment art (Masters), and after being in various jobs and projects for a while, I am ready to create something of my own. I have worked on my game ""Modulated"" for a long time as a side project while I studied and worked. But it has reached a point where I need to work at it as a full job to complete it, and that means covering living expenses.
If I can get the funding needed, I will see to it that the game gets all the attention it needs and gets developed quickly and efficiently.

Without your help, this game will probably never be finished and be forgotten, a new indie development business in a country which sorely needs more love for the art of video games will never get established. 

It is about so much more than just the game.

If you have any questions or just want to talk, join our Facebook Group.
Thank you for your time so far! :D



 Modulated is a Mech Combat simulator.It's a game where you put together your own mech, and try it out against other mechs.The game focuses a lot on planned tactical and strategic movement rather than neccesarily twitch reflexes.It is currently being developed for PC using the Unreal Development kit, but I am willing to look at spreading the game for more platforms should the game be successful and the platform be viable after the game has been released.
The goals of the game are as follows:
Customization. Not only will you be able to customize over 18 different parts of your mech, you will also be able to customize its paintjob to create your unique style.
Arena. Herein lies the core game, bring your creation to various arenas to fight for different prizes.

Rivals. Mechs will have recognizable names, tactics and setups, each having different ways to be defeated. You will remember who destroyed your mech last time, and be ready for revenge.

Tournaments. Join large tournaments ending in a single duel against the top mech, for greater and unique rewards.

Rankings. As you work your way up, compare your statistics and fighting prowess to the other mech pilots in the game.

Challenges. As your name gets more known, pilots will start challenging you to duels where you will fight for parts of each other's mechs.


Now these are the base goals of the game, there are a lot more features that I would love to implement and that the game has been designed to support.These are:

Research tree. Develop your own parts by researching and crafting from scraps gained from your defeated opponents.

Exploration, explore the world, scavenge for unique parts and fight bandit mechs and ancient, collossus mechs roaming the world. Trade with and fight for various factions.

Multiplayer support: Test your design against your friends!
And more..!


However, these features will take of funding (or rather, time) to implement, and will only be doable as stretch goals, or should the game be financially successful after it's release.
Yes, that's right, I wish to continue to add to the game and improve it after it's ""done"".

You can find a very, early alpha at Desura! Please keep in mind that it is a mere skeleton of the game, with no progress, a lot of placeholder art, and lots of bugs.
 

Check out the gallery for more screenshots and a trailer!

When you are working on something full time, regardless of how little expenses the project itself has, there are expenses to cover.
First of all, living costs. Most of the funding will go to cover living costs during the development period, however, I will be living very cheaply, and the funds will only cover cheap, basic food, shelter and power, in order to maximize the potential of the funds, and so that you don't feel I am spending the money on myself.Think of it as funds for development time.

Safety net. There will always be unexpected expenses and opportunities, a little extra of the fund goes to this.

Extras. And at last there is a bit dedicated to things like covering the perks, some occasional outsourcing to things I cannot cover myself, like voiceover and music, and help that may speed up the process.




If the complete goal isn't reached, the game will get developed as far as the funds go, the game will then be released as an early access version for sale (perks will still be valid!), and the game will continue to be developed as long as sales and support cover continued development.
 
  




I am an indie game designer and environment artist who graduated with a masters degree not to long ago.
I have done several smaller projects before (nothing big or commercial), and I have seen, experienced and learned what people do wrong and what to avoid, I am finally ready to create my own proper game.



I understand that to you, this is probably ""just another indie game"". But to me, getting through this successfully means a lot. 
I will finally be able to fullfill my dreams of becoming an indie game developer and create my own games. 
 I will be able to establish a proper indie game company that can expand over time and give opportunities to others like me for jobs in the future.
This is what I burn for, what I want to do, and nothing compares to this.I will give the game and indie game company my full attention, gladly!




  It is always risky to develop something with a small team, let alone on your own.You need to be able to cover all areas of development, which is very difficult and time consuming for one person, but doable if you start small and have the experience neccessary. 
While my education is within the general setup of a game and it's visuals, I do have quite a bit of experience with games programming, as I have been programming a lot on my previous projects. I have been able to put my game together efficiently without too many issues so far.
 I have however, very little experience with sound design. But I do aim for high quality sounds and music. I believe I have managed to cover the sounds of the game pretty well, but I will need funding for proper soundtracks.
Another problem is time evaluation, when you are many people working on the same project, time lost by an individual get mitigated by the whole team. When you are stuck and alone, any time spent on solving issues is time 100% lost. This means that work that was meant to take 1 day can quickly take 3 days to a week. I currently plan on releasing the first version of the game some time during the summer 2015. But should the game not be complete, I will start selling it as an early access version, and keep developing until it is complete.

</div><div> <p>We hope that there will be players for Return to Midway, but we feel like the kind of game we want to run is not a game for ten people. We decided that we'd only run the game to a group of more than thirty people. Our target for this campaign is thirty players times the cost of a ticket - if we end up hitting the target with less people due to other perks, that's fine too.

<p>What you get is an evening's entertainment. Your support for Return to Midway goes entirely into the game - we've never been about making a profit.

Team Midway have been responsible for hundreds of hours of gaming entertainment as individuals, and for twenty-eight separate games as a team, ranging from four-hour episodes to forty-eight hour epics. We're already in touch with our site, who are fully in agreement with our plans and who will provide insurance for us.  </div><div>But without you - yes, you! - it's not going to happen. Red Barn's a big enough site when it's pitch black, and we've seen small groups get swallowed up by it before now. That's why we're setting minimum numbers. If we don't get them, we won't run the game and we'll be very sad.</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Short of more than half of the team getting hit by a bus we can't think of anything that stands in the way of doing this, bar you - our audience - not wanting us to.

<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>If we manage to raise more than the money we need to run this game it will go straight back into running the game - if and when we meet our goal we'll announce what happens if we just get a teeny bit further. Stay tuned for updates!</p>

We're already in touch with our site, who are fully in agreement with our plans and who will provide insurance for us.  But without you - yes, you! - it's not going to happen. Red Barn's a big enough site when it's pitch black, and we've seen small groups get swallowed up by it before now. That's why we're setting minimum numbers. If we don't get them, we won't run the game and we'll be very sad.  
Risks & Challenges Short of more than half of the team getting hit by a bus we can't think of anything that stands in the way of doing this, bar you - our audience - not wanting us to. Our rules are already written and have been tested over a lot of games. We have the complete support of our site partner. Rather than spend time putting rules together and chasing a site we'd like to spend the time we have in development of the best experience we can.

Stretch Goals
If we manage to raise more than the money we need to run this game it will go straight back into running the game - if and when we meet our goal we'll announce what happens if we just get a teeny bit further. Stay tuned for updates!

    I Can't Go - How Else Can I Help? That's a terrible shame - we'll miss you! If you want to help us out, though, spread the word about the game as far and wide as you can! We'll be doing the same but we'll take all the help we can get.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

Eventually we would like to make this pretty robust and have ranks per game mode but this is a start!</p><h3>Player Stats</h3><p>A big goal of ours is to implement ranked play down the road. We have started by providing a rank and player stats however they are only used for bragging rights at the moment</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458942577/cpu43pmu1y7yoyxgae3h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><em>(As you can see my character stats in the Editor are pretty bad at the moment)</em></p><h3>Soundtrack</h3><p>Michael has compiled all the songs he wrote for the game into the soundtrack and we're looking at 37 original songs with over 2 hours of music! The soundtrack will be available on itunes from Michael (link coming later) if you didn't pick up a deluxe junker perk in time.</p><h3>VOIP upgraded</h3><p>We have completely upgraded the in game Voip system. The game will use your Vive mic to let you communicate with other players, the grip button is push to talk.</p><h3><strong>Lots of Polish</strong></h3><p>We have made a major push for some final polish to the game, updating textures, lighting, adding special effects to many things. All ships now have special effects like so:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458942934/uzvncirmjhagdnnojdxn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Character clothing color is now selectable to differentiate yourself while we work on getting additional character models implemented. Recoil animations have been updated to work at 90fps (they don't look shaky anymore!).  We have implemented the final Steam Achievements, trading cards, etc. as well!</p><h3>Hover Junkers is no longer listed as Early Access on Steam</h3><p>Some of you may have noticed Hover Junkers is no longer listed as Early Access on steam. We feel we have reached version 1.0 with Multiplayer and are ready to release! We still fully plan to support the game with frequent updates post launch including Singleplayer, additional modes, more weapons, more characters, more ships, and more weirdness.</p><h2>Thank you all for backing and making this campaign successful, we can't wait to see you all in VR!</h2><p></p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<div>
<h2>SETTLERS MONUMENT</h2>
<p>For all of you awesome backers out there, here are some screenshots of the in game Settlers Monument memorial where your name will be listed for all players to see!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457734519/wkmvnezro5ntuj6tkrhw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You will have a chance to set the name you want on it after the campaign is over. Don't worry it doesn't have to be the name you chose when backing, it can be set when we send out the surveys.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457734587/otrsy7if42bxd1nuctz1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>(These are example names pulled from the campaign already, if you're on here and are wanting a different name up there, don't worry you will get a chance to send the correct name in!!!).  </p>
<p>Each name shows up pretty huge and are very readable in the headset so don't worry about anyone missing it!</p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457734825/ja3u8frs7h6zkjatgebm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The monument can be found in the multiplayer map: New Eden, as well as at the end of the single player campaign when it is available after launch.  </p>
<h3>Now for the number one most requested thing: </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457735002/emtyjyl1yrqwnbcswkkt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This weapon will NOT be available in traditional team deathmatch or free for all, we don't want everyone to feel the need to always be hiding on your ship as you fly around. So this weapon will be saved for when we begin playing with additional modes after launch (There would potentially be a sniper specific game mode), also it will be available for hunting in single player.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457735236/lywbijnl9jkjloqpqv2x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>it heats up when fired too.</p>
<p>and before you even ask, yes the scope works:</p>

<h1><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Hover Junkers</span></h1>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;line-height: 24px;"">In August of 2014 we at Stress Level Zero took a trip up to Valve HQ and were introduced to their VR room and Room-Scale VR. We were in awe of the tech and only wanted to design for such a system.  Unfortunately at the time they couldn't foresee such tech being ready for the home until 2018 or later. Fast forward to March of 2015.  The HTC Vive is announced as a consumer version of the Valve VR Room-Scale experience.  </span><span style=""font-size: 18px;line-height: 24px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Twenty minutes later we had formulated the initial idea for Hover Junkers:  </span></p>
<p><i style=""font-size: 18px;line-height: 24px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">""What do we have to work with?""............""A Room""    </i><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;line-height: 24px;""><i>""If only rooms could move""......................""They could hover?""  </i></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;line-height: 24px;""><i>""Guns?""......................................................""Obviously""  </i></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;line-height: 24px;"">  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;line-height: 24px;"">So here we are almost a full year later and the game is nearing completion. VR is absolutely without any doubt the coolest thing we have ever had a chance to create for and couldn't be more excited about the coming consumer launch. We can't wait for all of you to get your hands on the hardware and join us in VR for a technological revolution of near unparalleled potential!</span></p>

<p>Hover Junkers is a multiplayer focused flying platform shooting game built from the ground up exclusively for VR WITH TRACKED CONTROLS ONLY. Choose your ship based on your room scale play area, enter into multiplayer combat areas to claim scrap/loot, and have shootouts against enemy player junkers. Using scrap as defenses against incoming fire, you can physically dodge, hide, and shoot from behind the cover of your ship's defenses.</p>

</h4>
<p>We have been developing Hover Junkers since March 2015, and are now on the final stretch for release.  After receiving many requests for pre-orders and ways for the community to support the game, the best way for us to answer is by providing a limited run campaign here on IndieGoGo. We want to provide the community with special limited rewards for taking such an interest in the project!<br/></p>

<p>The game is coming out regardless of the result of this campaign. We are now down to the final crunch and only need to iron out some last bugs.

<p>The Single Player campaign pays homage to the survival story genre made popular by the classic 'Oregon Trail'.  Players choose a profession which allots them with a number of credits to spend on goods/resources/trinkets with which they will need to smuggle across the world along with several NPC characters… assuming they survive the trip!</p>

</div></div>","Keys Keys Keys (Also a belated ""WE DID IT!"")
Release keys will begin going out right now. Expect an email sometime today or early next week with your steam code for the game. The game unlocks April 5th at noon PST.  Soundtrack and Development scrapbook keys will be sent separately to the Deluxe Junker backers and up later next week.Here are some of the things we have been working on around the clock for launch:Twitch ChatTwitch chat is now visible in game and you can set it to any twitch.tv chat channel you want, so all you streamers out there can see whats going on in your chat while you play.LeaderboardsWe have implemented a leaderboard so you can see where you rank in game now. Eventually we would like to make this pretty robust and have ranks per game mode but this is a start!Player StatsA big goal of ours is to implement ranked play down the road. We have started by providing a rank and player stats however they are only used for bragging rights at the moment(As you can see my character stats in the Editor are pretty bad at the moment)SoundtrackMichael has compiled all the songs he wrote for the game into the soundtrack and we're looking at 37 original songs with over 2 hours of music! The soundtrack will be available on itunes from Michael (link coming later) if you didn't pick up a deluxe junker perk in time.VOIP upgradedWe have completely upgraded the in game Voip system. The game will use your Vive mic to let you communicate with other players, the grip button is push to talk.Lots of PolishWe have made a major push for some final polish to the game, updating textures, lighting, adding special effects to many things. All ships now have special effects like so:Character clothing color is now selectable to differentiate yourself while we work on getting additional character models implemented. Recoil animations have been updated to work at 90fps (they don't look shaky anymore!).  We have implemented the final Steam Achievements, trading cards, etc. as well!Hover Junkers is no longer listed as Early Access on SteamSome of you may have noticed Hover Junkers is no longer listed as Early Access on steam. We feel we have reached version 1.0 with Multiplayer and are ready to release! We still fully plan to support the game with frequent updates post launch including Singleplayer, additional modes, more weapons, more characters, more ships, and more weirdness.Thank you all for backing and making this campaign successful, we can't wait to see you all in VR!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SETTLERS MONUMENT
For all of you awesome backers out there, here are some screenshots of the in game Settlers Monument memorial where your name will be listed for all players to see!

You will have a chance to set the name you want on it after the campaign is over. Don't worry it doesn't have to be the name you chose when backing, it can be set when we send out the surveys.

(These are example names pulled from the campaign already, if you're on here and are wanting a different name up there, don't worry you will get a chance to send the correct name in!!!).  
Each name shows up pretty huge and are very readable in the headset so don't worry about anyone missing it!
 
The monument can be found in the multiplayer map: New Eden, as well as at the end of the single player campaign when it is available after launch.  
Now for the number one most requested thing: 

This weapon will NOT be available in traditional team deathmatch or free for all, we don't want everyone to feel the need to always be hiding on your ship as you fly around. So this weapon will be saved for when we begin playing with additional modes after launch (There would potentially be a sniper specific game mode), also it will be available for hunting in single player.

it heats up when fired too.
and before you even ask, yes the scope works:

Thank you to all the backers who have shown your appreciation by backing the campaign. We can't wait for you all to get your VR hardware and hop in game for some crazy gunfights!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hover Junkers
In August of 2014 we at Stress Level Zero took a trip up to Valve HQ and were introduced to their VR room and Room-Scale VR. We were in awe of the tech and only wanted to design for such a system.  Unfortunately at the time they couldn't foresee such tech being ready for the home until 2018 or later. Fast forward to March of 2015.  The HTC Vive is announced as a consumer version of the Valve VR Room-Scale experience.  Twenty minutes later we had formulated the initial idea for Hover Junkers:  
""What do we have to work with?""............""A Room""    
""If only rooms could move""......................""They could hover?""  
""Guns?""......................................................""Obviously""  
  
So here we are almost a full year later and the game is nearing completion. VR is absolutely without any doubt the coolest thing we have ever had a chance to create for and couldn't be more excited about the coming consumer launch. We can't wait for all of you to get your hands on the hardware and join us in VR for a technological revolution of near unparalleled potential!




What is Hover Junkers?  Virtual Reality Multiplayer Shooter
Hover Junkers is a multiplayer focused flying platform shooting game built from the ground up exclusively for VR WITH TRACKED CONTROLS ONLY. Choose your ship based on your room scale play area, enter into multiplayer combat areas to claim scrap/loot, and have shootouts against enemy player junkers. Using scrap as defenses against incoming fire, you can physically dodge, hide, and shoot from behind the cover of your ship's defenses.



Why do an IndieGoGo?  Rewarding the Community of Fans

We have been developing Hover Junkers since March 2015, and are now on the final stretch for release.  After receiving many requests for pre-orders and ways for the community to support the game, the best way for us to answer is by providing a limited run campaign here on IndieGoGo. We want to provide the community with special limited rewards for taking such an interest in the project!





Well what happens if the goal isn't met?  The game releases regardless.

The game is coming out regardless of the result of this campaign. We are now down to the final crunch and only need to iron out some last bugs. No matter what, Hover Junkers will be released with the launch of the HTC Vive in April. The purpose for this campaign is to reward supporters who want to get involved early!




When will Hover Junkers be released?  April for the Vive Launch

Hover Junkers is slated to release right along side the HTC Vive in April and will provide early VR adopters with exciting multiplayer VR combat as well as an exciting single player player adventure. When the Oculus Touch releases in Q3-4, Touch players will be able to join in the action as well! You will receive your Steam key shortly after this campaign ends.






Check out this early multiplayer video!





Choose your character, grab your ship, pick a map, and start hunting for junk. Using loot found in lost shipping containers, you fortify your junker in preparation for shootouts with other junk hunters.


More info on Characters, Weapons, and Ships to come!



Single Player


The Single Player campaign pays homage to the survival story genre made popular by the classic 'Oregon Trail'.  Players choose a profession which allots them with a number of credits to spend on goods/resources/trinkets with which they will need to smuggle across the world along with several NPC characters… assuming they survive the trip!

<p><img alt=""Short short story of Manorhouse Workshop"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.alien.it/public/mhw-indie/title-the-story-so-far.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;"" title=""The Story So Far""/></p>
<p style=""font-size: 14px;"">Hi everyone, my name’s Lorenzo Marchetto, founder of Manorhouse Workshop, which deals with 28-35mm Wargames’ and modelism kit making since more than 13 years.</p>
<p>Our main activity is the production of buildings, sceneray elements, and modular gaming tables for tridimensional wargames and static modelism.</p>
<p>During our years of activity, we did work wiht a lot of national and international societies of this sector, providing them with dioramas, models, and other works. Those societies inclues <strong>Games Workshop</strong>, <strong>Rackham</strong>, <strong>Italeri</strong>, <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong>, without forgetting editors’ houses like <strong>Hachette</strong> and <strong>Hobby&amp;Work</strong>, or TV channels like <strong>Disney Channel</strong> and <strong>RAI</strong>.</p>
<p>When working with privates collectionists or players, we did give birth to historical or fantasy’s reproductions, like Helm’s Deep of the Lord of the Rings, Falkenstein Castle in Corinthia or the Templar Castle of Almuruol in Portugal.</p>
<p><img alt=""Some old work for collectors - wargamers"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.alien.it/public/mhw-indie/lavori-old.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Some old work for collectors - wargamers""/></p>
<p>Our passion even made us create <strong>Mindstalkers</strong>, a 3D Skirmish Wargame in 35mm, which received a Nomination for the ""Best of Show"" at the prestigious Italian Fair of Lucca Games, finishing as 1<sup>st</sup> in 3D Wargames category.</p>
<p>Our experience, throughout the years allowed us to project and continuously build a range of modular scenary kits that can thus be combined to create multiple and infinite results, be it for outside or inside scopes, while having an extreme sturdiness yet keeping perfect realism, as you can see (<strong>to see hundreds of examples of our works, <a href=""http://manorhouseworkshopmindstalkers.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">come visit our Blog</a></strong>!).</p>
<p><img alt=""Some other samples of our work"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.alien.it/public/mhw-indie/sample-photos.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Some other samples of our work""/></p>
<p>It is our wish to keep bettering ourselves, by continue to create new products with new state of the art materials and priting techniques, like we’ve been constantly doing during our long history.<br/> </p>

<p></p><hr/><p>This new series of kit, <strong>while increasing the modular possibilities</strong> of modelism and <strong>the level of details -</strong> and giving you a fresh new design - <strong>will be fully compatible with all of our existing products.</strong></p>
<p>This new series of kits will also be produced with an increased industrial policy: the material will be high quality polyreuthane resin, and the production will be done using the latest vacuum and printing technologies, with new generation silicons molds which highly lower down miscasts... and this will mean lower kit prices too!</p>
<p>This innovation will allows us to <strong>print the models both sides</strong>, while still keeping all doors and windows open to keep all gaming options open. <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>

Our decision to transition from an artisanal production to a new semi industrial one, and to direct client sales allows us to use the Indiegogo platform to its fullest, since it brings us into contact with you, our potential customers.<p></p>
<p>To bring it to life, <strong>we need you</strong>. We need your pledge so that we can have ""the numbers"" to lower production costs, and to gain better delivery costs for all. Indeed, you will be the one to decide if this project is worthy of success. And you will be the one to benefit from all the advantages, discounts and rewards.</p>
<p>By reaching our Indiegogo goal we will be able to start the production, and it will allow you to <strong>gain great gifts and rewards</strong>, while <strong>economizing on the final price</strong>... and if the project will rise and pass objectives and objectives, <strong>more and more prices and adds-on will be open</strong> to you!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/276962/files/20131224043650-stretch-goal.jpg?1387888610"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/252310/files/20131209234022-updated.jpg?1386661222"" src="""" style=""width: 572.814px; height: 119px;""/></p><p></p><h1><a href=""http://manorhouseworkshopmindstalkers.wordpress.com/2014/01/28/update-23-activated-great-tournament/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Update 24 – Activated Great tournament</a></h1><p><strong>Hello to all.</strong><br/><strong>Activated Also the perk dedicated to the <a href=""http://igg.me/at/indiemanorhouse/x/3077600"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Grand Tournament.</a></strong><br/><strong>(Soon we will post the item pictures)</strong></p>

of June we ready to be shipped Watermill, all the houses and the

Today we present a tutorial on how to paint the house in wood and stone. Good vision. Lorenzo

Of course, the pieces will be private  of the sprue that you see at the base of the piece before being boxed and shipped.
To you it will remain just a little cleanup work to remove any residue due to the separation.
LorenzoThe water mill ready for printing.Hello to all. This is a technical update. We want to show the various stages of processing of our models. This is certainly the most boring but also the most important in the whole process of Print.

to regenerate in a short time and always with the highest precision the 
silicones worn out...Stay tuned. LorenzoNew update: Great TournamentHello to all.After a certain amount of time devoted to the bureaucratic side

charges will be reduced and we will mail them as regular registered 
recorded mail or priority mail, at a significantly lower price then the 
heavier kits.

Lorenzo




Hi everyone, my name’s Lorenzo Marchetto, founder of Manorhouse Workshop, which deals with 28-35mm Wargames’ and modelism kit making since more than 13 years.
Our main activity is the production of buildings, sceneray elements, and modular gaming tables for tridimensional wargames and static modelism.
During our years of activity, we did work wiht a lot of national and international societies of this sector, providing them with dioramas, models, and other works. Those societies inclues Games Workshop, Rackham, Italeri, Wizards of the Coast, without forgetting editors’ houses like Hachette and Hobby&Work, or TV channels like Disney Channel and RAI.
When working with privates collectionists or players, we did give birth to historical or fantasy’s reproductions, like Helm’s Deep of the Lord of the Rings, Falkenstein Castle in Corinthia or the Templar Castle of Almuruol in Portugal.

Our passion even made us create Mindstalkers, a 3D Skirmish Wargame in 35mm, which received a Nomination for the ""Best of Show"" at the prestigious Italian Fair of Lucca Games, finishing as 1st in 3D Wargames category.
Our experience, throughout the years allowed us to project and continuously build a range of modular scenary kits that can thus be combined to create multiple and infinite results, be it for outside or inside scopes, while having an extreme sturdiness yet keeping perfect realism, as you can see (to see hundreds of examples of our works, come visit our Blog!).

It is our wish to keep bettering ourselves, by continue to create new products with new state of the art materials and priting techniques, like we’ve been constantly doing during our long history. 

Update 21 – Now all the buildings are activated…
…And  you can create all of this!But also all this.
This new series of kit, while increasing the modular possibilities of modelism and the level of details - and giving you a fresh new design - will be fully compatible with all of our existing products.
This new series of kits will also be produced with an increased industrial policy: the material will be high quality polyreuthane resin, and the production will be done using the latest vacuum and printing technologies, with new generation silicons molds which highly lower down miscasts... and this will mean lower kit prices too!
This innovation will allows us to print the models both sides, while still keeping all doors and windows open to keep all gaming options open. 
Whi IndiegogoThis Manorhouse Workshop project is very big and complex, and requires a hefty investment. Our decision to transition from an artisanal production to a new semi industrial one, and to direct client sales allows us to use the Indiegogo platform to its fullest, since it brings us into contact with you, our potential customers.
To bring it to life, we need you. We need your pledge so that we can have ""the numbers"" to lower production costs, and to gain better delivery costs for all. Indeed, you will be the one to decide if this project is worthy of success. And you will be the one to benefit from all the advantages, discounts and rewards.
By reaching our Indiegogo goal we will be able to start the production, and it will allow you to gain great gifts and rewards, while economizing on the final price... and if the project will rise and pass objectives and objectives, more and more prices and adds-on will be open to you!Update 24 – Activated Great tournamentHello to all.Activated Also the perk dedicated to the Grand Tournament.(Soon we will post the item pictures)

<div><b>WHO ARE THE TEMPEST TWO?</b></div>
<div></div>James Whittle &amp; Tom Caulfield are two regular 25 year olds attempting to achieve something extraordinary. Together they make up The Tempest Two, one of around 20 teams aiming to row the Atlantic Ocean in December 2015. The challenge ahead is widely regarded as the hardest-race-on-earth, and would seemingly only be attempted by the toughest, most seasoned athletes this planet has to offer, the rugged expedition-hardened individuals that only seem to exist in fiction and film. However, like in any tale of adventure, there is often an underdog.<br/><br/>Watch our second film below, Follow us on Facebook, Twitter &amp; Instagram.<br/>@thetempesttwo | The Tempest Two<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F115808082&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F115808082&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F502069106_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/>

</div>
<div>
<p>The Tempest Two will be taking part in the 2015 Talisker Whiskey Challenge, a 3000 mile rowing race from La Gomera in the Canary Islands, to the Caribbean island of Antigua. The gruelling voyage is widely known as the toughest-race-on-earth, and is guaranteed to push participants to their absolute limits both mentally and physically.</p>
<p>The pair aim to join an elite group of 500 who have completed the crossing, a far smaller number than Everest Summiteers and North Pole Expeditionists.</p>
</div>

<p></p>
<p>Once the race begins, James and Tom will row 24 hours a day in shifts of 2 hours-on, 2 hours-off for up to 60 days straight.</p>
<p>Alongside the punishing physical regime, the boys will face some very sizable obstacles in order to reach their destination. Unfortunately, the Atlantic isn't an environment renown for 'Plain Sailing', and the threat of hurricane strength storms and swells in excess of 50 foot are a likely adversary. </p>
<p>Sharks and Whales are also an innate fear that could become a reality, the majority of crossings to date have had close shaves with curious predators, with one boat being repeatedly rammed by a hungry shark and others escaping the unassuming power of a tail-fin by a whisker.</p>
<p>The crossing itself could last over 2 months, but the journey has already begun. For the next 365 days, the boys will try their best to prepare themselves for the task, and gain as much knowledge from others to build their confidence and know-how heading into the race. Having no rowing experience whatsoever places an even greater emphasis on preparation, and becoming comfortable and able on-the-sea.</p>
</div>
<div><b>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</b></div>
<div>In order for the dream to become a reality, the Tempest Two must raise an initial £120,000 to reach the start line. This cost covers everything from building a sea-ready boat, to the food packs that will give them energy they need to reach Antigua. </div>
<div>Once the initial money is raised, then the true magic happens, as every penny will be split between the pairs chosen charities; Make-A-Wish Foundation &amp; Brain Tumour Research. </div>

One hundred years ago, the continents of Faylien and Dakk’rund were in the midst of a global conflict. In a last ditch effort, the forces of Faylien proposed an end-all solution to the Dakk’rian invasion: destroy its selactic source, the vessel containing the sum of the continents magical energies.
Although the Dakk’rians were repelled and the war was brought to an end, there were some irreversible damages to the Dakk’rian continent due to the destruction of the selactic source. The people stopped aging. The environment began to rot. Lush trees and forests became gray brush and dusty barren valleys. 
 
The Dakk'rians never forgot the humiliation and pain they suffered due to Faylien's daring and reckless strategy. Even though it took one hundred years, they were finally ready to bring about their revenge. Peaceful days in Faylien are coming to an abrupt end, and it is up to you as Mage and his friends to end the enemy invasion and take back your home!

Whim Independent Studios is a new independent game development company formed in late 2012 by Grover Wimberly IV, Matthew Estrada, and Paul Vela. 
Our aim is to create fun games of many different genres in order to appeal to a wide variety of audiences. Along with Selatria, the development studio is working on an upcoming mobile game coded in ActionScript3 and another action game which is currently in the conceptual stages.

Up until this point, we have been developing Selatria for free with with relatively limited resources. We would use your support to completely fulfill the game’s vision. This includes commissioning artists, sound designers, composers, and game designers and programmers to make sure the development of Selatria can see completion. We would like to use the development funds to make the current assets consistent with each other. 
 
After evaluating startup costs and commissioning the team, we have deduced that in order to complete the main story in our project, we would need at least $5000 for the fundraising campaign. We also have ideas for stretch goals if we can gather enough support! 
 
Not everyone can donate, we know times are tough. But if you like what we are doing, please, tell your friends and family. Anything you can do helps: watch our trailers, ""like"" us on Facebook, ""like"" this campaign, gives us a shoutout on Google+, hashtag Selatria, whatever helps spread the word.

Selatria (Sel’-ə-tri”-ə) is the collective name of the free-flowing magical energy that flows throughout the world. The essence is released freely through openings called Selactic Sources, and those who can feel/sense the essence are allowed to harness its power and use magic.
 
 
 
Selatria can be found in many forms. In a solid rocky state, it can be obtained in the form of active or dormant Selactite. It can also be found in a misty state, which supplies rich magical energy to those who can sense it.
 
 
 
 
 

 
Like previously stated, it is developed using RPG Maker VX. We have also heavily modified theTankentai battle system framework, giving the characters more presence during combat.
 
 
 
 
 

 
Team Attack Battle System – A spin on the traditional turn-based battle system that allows compatible party members to chain extra attacks off of team members’ special abilities known as “Triggers”.

<h3>Human Nature</h3>
<p>A meteorite crashed into earth, releasing a strange airborn mutagen that affects simple lifeforms, creating huge mutated insects and plant life. Regular life has been disrupted and life has turned into survival of the fittest.</p>
<p>Besides making sure you get enough nutrients and supplies, you have to fight off mutated creatures and figure out if other people (players) can be trusted. Human nature, can you control it?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Survive in a 256km2 or 159.07 square miles area in any way you want!</strong></h3>
<p>All the areas have been designed with several playing styles or combinations of them in mind. For example, you can get into a city in numerous ways. You can sneak through the woodlands to the outskirts of the city, hide behind cars, obstacles and plants or you could simply walk up the road with your weapon ready or even jump from rooftop to rooftop!</p>
<p><strong>Some of the things you can do:</strong></p>
<p>Play ""loner' style or in groups or any combination.</p>
<p>Trade with other players, help other players, rob or kill them. But remember, they might fight back!</p>
<p>Forage for food, water and supplies in the forest or cities, hunt  insects for food or simply get it from another player.</p>
<p>Explore several cities, industrial zones, woodlands and even a military base!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Some features of the game:</strong></p>
<p>A well balanced weapons system with realistic damage.</p>
<p>A day and night system</p>
<p>Numerous mutated insects in all shapes and sizes that want a piece of you.</p>
<p>""Safe zones"" that are safe from mutated insects (not other players). Some of these zones can be defended by one player and some can only be defended by a bigger group of players. This is done to give loners and groups both a fair chance.</p>
<p>Food and water system, you will need to eat and drink or suffer the consequences. You can't run dehydrated and your aim gets shaky without enough food. Without nutrients you will die.</p>
<p>There are no lives or respawns. Once you die it's over, you lose all your stuff you had to fight so hard for. You will have to start over.</p>

<h2>So what is this about?</h2>
<p>This is about a realistic online multiplayer game that i have been wanting to make for a very long time. Recently i found some free time and i have started to create my dream game in my free time. The world map is about 90% done, except for little details (grass, random clutter and world dressing) that will be implemented after you, the supporter, have play tested the alpha game and found it good enough to go into beta stage.</p>
<h3><strong>Help me create an online game experience that has never been seen before and be part of it!</strong></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What have i done so far?</h3>
<p>I am creating the game world- 90% done (check the gallery!)</p>
<p>I am modeling  the mutated insects- 30% done (check the gallery!)</p>
<p>I have designed the weapon system.</p>
<p>I am doing the sound design- 60% done</p>
<p>I have done the weapon concept art.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What will i use the money for?</h2>
<p>It will only be used to get the game ready for alpha testing by you. I do not want to spend money on perks that could be used to develop the game, hence why all the perks are in-game only. I set the 20000 goal because i believe it is realistic and should be achievable. Yes it is a low amount and i would be thrilled if it went way over that 20000, but i am prepared to do a lot of bootstrapping. Any funds raised will help cut down development time and with enough i could even implement more features. The game will be available for PC and MAC, with more funding we could get it on consoles too.</p>
<h3>I will use the money for:</h3>
<ul>
<li>3d engine license</li>
<li>professional dynamic lighting</li>
<li>an animator to make the creatures come alive</li>
<li>a 3d modeler to model the weapons and misc. objects</li>
<li>a programmer to make sure everythings runs smooth and gets implemented perfectly</li>
<li>a server for the supporters / alpha and beta testers</li>
<li>a better machine to run the creation tools on to speed up the workflow</li>
<li>more funds means cutting down development time and more implemented features</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<p>I know not every has money to just give away, but even if you don't you can still help me a lot! Spread the world about this game and this campain to raise money. Share it on twitter, facebook, your website / blog or any other type of outlet you have, it will help me so much. THANK YOU!</p>

<p>Shantek Studios has been developing self published and third party games and applications for both Windows Phone and Windows 8 for the last 2 years. Over this time our biggest game Wheel of Wealth has seen great success, with the game currently being in the top 1% of the Windows Phone marketplace.</p>
<p>We have had a huge demand for our games to be available on other platforms, including iPad, iPhone and Android. As we are currently only equiped for Windows Phone And Windows 8 development, this project will allow us to broaden out our platforms we publish to, and to publish further games to these other platforms moving forward.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Existing app</h3>
<p>Wheel of Wealth is a turn based game that allows up to 3 players from all around the world to compete in solving the puzzles. The current game available on the Windows platforms also has a solo play mode &amp; a pass and play mode available, and is free for all players ad-supported with the option to remove ad's with an in-app purchase.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our plans with funding</h3>
<p><strong>If we raise under 50% ($20,000-)</strong></p>
<p>Development will progress at a slower pace with less resources available, with development beginning initially on iOS first. The game will be to a similar spec as the existing Windows Phone version, adapted to the iOS platform to feel native.</p>
<p><strong>If we raise over 75% of the target ($30,000+)</strong></p>
<p>We will direct more resources in to the project with faster development time and Android will then be an included platform after the iOS version finishes development. The games will be to a similar spec as the existing Windows Phone &amp; Windows 8 version. At 75%, all platforms published to will include a real-time live multiplayer mode for cross platform real-time play!</p>
<p><strong>If we raise over 100% of the target ($40,000+)</strong></p>
<p>The game will be re-developed to use the unity engine allowing us to develop the existing game in to a much richer 3d experience for the user. This will include a total rewrite of the game with a large investment in the visual design. at 100%+ we will publish to all unity platforms, including BlackBerry. As above, this will also include the real-time play across platforms as well as the turn based and solo modes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Please note: </strong></p>
<p>If it hit's 75% this will then also include the Android version. However under 50% will mean the iOS version will be just turn based multiplayer initially (and not a unity based project). </p>
<p>Reaching 100% of our target goal will allow us to bring on an additional developer to speed up the development process dramatically. If the project is to receive under 50%, we will be doing out best to get the iOS version under development with the resources available based on the funds raised.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As we are very limited on resources for platforms outside of our current portfolio, the funding will allow us to bring the game to as many platforms as possible, and to offer a much larger user-base for all our players. </p>
<p>Should we not reach our 100% goal, funds will be distributed in a way that will best allow us to develop the iOS version as soon as practical.</p>
<p>Be sure to check out the perks to the right to get on board with your support and be rewarded!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't contribute personally? Never fear, you can still help. Be sure to spread the word as much as possible!

Over this time our biggest game Wheel of Wealth has seen great success, with the game currently being in the top 1% of the Windows Phone marketplace.
We have had a huge demand for our games to be available on other platforms, including iPad, iPhone and Android. As we are currently only equiped for Windows Phone And Windows 8 development, this project will allow us to broaden out our platforms we publish to, and to publish further games to these other platforms moving forward.
 
Existing app
Wheel of Wealth is a turn based game that allows up to 3 players from all around the world to compete in solving the puzzles. The current game available on the Windows platforms also has a solo play mode & a pass and play mode available, and is free for all players ad-supported with the option to remove ad's with an in-app purchase.
 
Our plans with funding
If we raise under 50% ($20,000-)
Development will progress at a slower pace with less resources available, with development beginning initially on iOS first. The game will be to a similar spec as the existing Windows Phone version, adapted to the iOS platform to feel native.
If we raise over 75% of the target ($30,000+)
We will direct more resources in to the project with faster development time and Android will then be an included platform after the iOS version finishes development. The games will be to a similar spec as the existing Windows Phone & Windows 8 version. At 75%, all platforms published to will include a real-time live multiplayer mode for cross platform real-time play!
If we raise over 100% of the target ($40,000+)
The game will be re-developed to use the unity engine allowing us to develop the existing game in to a much richer 3d experience for the user. This will include a total rewrite of the game with a large investment in the visual design. at 100%+ we will publish to all unity platforms, including BlackBerry. As above, this will also include the real-time play across platforms as well as the turn based and solo modes.
 
Please note: 
If it hit's 75% this will then also include the Android version. However under 50% will mean the iOS version will be just turn based multiplayer initially (and not a unity based project). 
Reaching 100% of our target goal will allow us to bring on an additional developer to speed up the development process dramatically. If the project is to receive under 50%, we will be doing out best to get the iOS version under development with the resources available based on the funds raised.
 
What We Need & What You Get
As we are very limited on resources for platforms outside of our current portfolio, the funding will allow us to bring the game to as many platforms as possible, and to offer a much larger user-base for all our players. 
Should we not reach our 100% goal, funds will be distributed in a way that will best allow us to develop the iOS version as soon as practical.
Be sure to check out the perks to the right to get on board with your support and be rewarded!
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Can't contribute personally? Never fear, you can still help. Be sure to spread the word as much as possible! Are you an existing Windows Phone or Windows 8 player of Wheel of Wealth and want to be able to play ANY of your friends? Spread the word to help raise awareness of this funding project!

<h2 dir=""ltr"">Our Vision</h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">In Lords of Xulima, we have set out to make a challenging, turn-based RPG in the vein of the old school classics. We're making a game filled with character development, puzzles and often difficult strategic combat. Our goal is to create an immersive environment and a challenging combat system; how you choose to play it will be entirely up to you.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Lords of Xulima is an isometric, turn-based, single-player, 2D role-playing game. It is set on a mythical lost continent called Xulima, where the world makers lived in ancient times. The game features a vast, challenging world where you will lead Gaulen the Explorer and five of his companions on an epic journey filled with the struggles of Gods and Men.</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""> <img alt=""Lords of Xulima - Castle of Nabros"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.lordsofxulima.com/wp-content/uploads/Lords-Of-Xulima-2013-05-05-09-01-27-05.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Lords of Xulima - Castle of Nabros""/>
</h2>
<h2 dir=""ltr"">Inspiration</h2>
<p dir=""ltr"">We draw our gameplay inspiration from the old school classics. We do enjoy some of the amenities and graphics of today’s RPGs, but too often they lack the depth and challenge of the games of the past. Our goal is to capture the complexity of past RPGs and deliver them in a modern game. The elements of RPGs that we find most intriguing are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<strong>An epic story:</strong> We love stories that are original and not afraid of being fully immersed in a fantasy world.  It’s an element that seems to be missing from games recently with the exception of some Japanese productions. Lords of Xulima tells just one part of an expansive mythology that chronicles the world from its creation until its ultimate end. We have no intention of being limited to themes like “political conspiracies” or “faction struggles”.</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<strong>A game system that rewards intelligence</strong><b>, imagination, and strategy:</b> We believe a good game should depend on these skills, instead of relying on the player's reflexes, or ability to hit a complicated combinations of buttons in a few milliseconds.</li>
<li dir=""ltr"">
<strong>A challenging environment:</strong> Yes, we love challenges.  We love feeling small and vulnerable in a vast, dangerous world.  We want our “stupid” actions to have negative consequences, and we want our accomplishments to feel like our own, because we've earned them. We don’t want to feel like success in a game is simply the result of a programmed script or tutorial that wants to convince us that we are heroes.  When you succeed in Lords of Xulima, it will be because you have played carefully, fought hard and earned your victory.</li>
</ul>

<p></p>
<p>Legends tell us that when the <b>earth</b> was young and void of life, the nine<b> Xulnari</b>, known as Gods by the men of old, took form and descended to the land. In the beginning the earth had only one great continent, <b>Rodina</b>. Over the grand ocean of Mirovia, the <b>Xulnari</b> raised a new continent where they would dwell and they called it<b> Xulima</b>, which means ‘Home of the Xulnari’.</p>
<p>From there, they began their grand work to create life to inhabit the great continent of <b>Rodina</b>. There were many attempts, over many years, but each new form of life was kept confined on Xulima, because none was deemed worthy to inherit the land of Rodina.</p>
<p>Finally, humans were created and the <b>Lords of Xulima</b>, proud of their work, sent them to Rodina. There the humans settled and created many kingdoms and cultures. With the passage of years, the remote continent of Xulima was largely forgotten by the humans, who only mentioned it in their oldest legends.</p>
<p>Time passed, and the kingdoms of the humans grew large and powerful; soon they also became proud and ambitious. Conflicts broke out between the great kingdoms and the continent was plunged into war, dragging every village and community into devastating strife that showed no signs of ending.</p>
<p>It is told that the Lords of Xulima, grieved by the conflict, wanted to intercede. However, not all were in agreement. A new war erupted, this one between the nine Lords themselves. Soon they left the world in order to move their conflict beyond the stars in an attempt to protect the land from their wrath.</p>
<p>But they did not abandon mankind entirely. <b>Golot</b>, the master of dreams, chose a herald among men to end the conflict that devastated Rodina. This Herald was <b>Gaulen</b> the Explorer. Guided by the dreams of Golot, Gaulen sailed east, crossing the great sea of Mirovia to reach the land of legend.</p>
<p><b>Gaulen and his group will be the first humans from the grand continent to walk on the sacred lands of Xulima.</b></p>

A 2D, turn-based Role-Playing Game with the depth and challenge of old-school classics and a modern, intuitive interface. 

Available in English and Spanish for PC, MAC & Linux.








Our Vision
In Lords of Xulima, we have set out to make a challenging, turn-based RPG in the vein of the old school classics. We're making a game filled with character development, puzzles and often difficult strategic combat. Our goal is to create an immersive environment and a challenging combat system; how you choose to play it will be entirely up to you.
Lords of Xulima is an isometric, turn-based, single-player, 2D role-playing game. It is set on a mythical lost continent called Xulima, where the world makers lived in ancient times. The game features a vast, challenging world where you will lead Gaulen the Explorer and five of his companions on an epic journey filled with the struggles of Gods and Men.
 

Inspiration
We draw our gameplay inspiration from the old school classics. We do enjoy some of the amenities and graphics of today’s RPGs, but too often they lack the depth and challenge of the games of the past. Our goal is to capture the complexity of past RPGs and deliver them in a modern game. The elements of RPGs that we find most intriguing are the following:


An epic story: We love stories that are original and not afraid of being fully immersed in a fantasy world.  It’s an element that seems to be missing from games recently with the exception of some Japanese productions. Lords of Xulima tells just one part of an expansive mythology that chronicles the world from its creation until its ultimate end. We have no intention of being limited to themes like “political conspiracies” or “faction struggles”.

A game system that rewards intelligence, imagination, and strategy: We believe a good game should depend on these skills, instead of relying on the player's reflexes, or ability to hit a complicated combinations of buttons in a few milliseconds.

A challenging environment: Yes, we love challenges.  We love feeling small and vulnerable in a vast, dangerous world.  We want our “stupid” actions to have negative consequences, and we want our accomplishments to feel like our own, because we've earned them. We don’t want to feel like success in a game is simply the result of a programmed script or tutorial that wants to convince us that we are heroes.  When you succeed in Lords of Xulima, it will be because you have played carefully, fought hard and earned your victory.

 



More than 60 hours of true role playing experience.
Create your party with up to six characters, choosing between 9 classes and more than 100 unique skills.
Strategic turn-based combat in first person view: Battle more than 100 enemies with unique skills and powers.
A vast continent to explore, with different environments and climates: You are free to go anywhere you want from the beginning of the game, but take care; the lands of Xulima are extremely dangerous.
More than 30 dungeons: Castles, towers and temples await for you to discover their secrets.
The depth and challenge of old school RPG classics, but with a modern, intuitive interface.  
Enchanting hand-drawn 2D graphics for landscapes and maps, mixed with 3D, pre-rendered models to bring smooth animations for characters and creatures.
Available for Windows, MAC and Linux.
Languages: English, Spanish.

 

 


Legends tell us that when the earth was young and void of life, the nine Xulnari, known as Gods by the men of old, took form and descended to the land. In the beginning the earth had only one great continent, Rodina. Over the grand ocean of Mirovia, the Xulnari raised a new continent where they would dwell and they called it Xulima, which means ‘Home of the Xulnari’.
From there, they began their grand work to create life to inhabit the great continent of Rodina. There were many attempts, over many years, but each new form of life was kept confined on Xulima, because none was deemed worthy to inherit the land of Rodina.
Finally, humans were created and the Lords of Xulima, proud of their work, sent them to Rodina. There the humans settled and created many kingdoms and cultures. With the passage of years, the remote continent of Xulima was largely forgotten by the humans, who only mentioned it in their oldest legends.
Time passed, and the kingdoms of the humans grew large and powerful; soon they also became proud and ambitious. Conflicts broke out between the great kingdoms and the continent was plunged into war, dragging every village and community into devastating strife that showed no signs of ending.
It is told that the Lords of Xulima, grieved by the conflict, wanted to intercede. However, not all were in agreement. A new war erupted, this one between the nine Lords themselves. Soon they left the world in order to move their conflict beyond the stars in an attempt to protect the land from their wrath.
But they did not abandon mankind entirely. Golot, the master of dreams, chose a herald among men to end the conflict that devastated Rodina. This Herald was Gaulen the Explorer. Guided by the dreams of Golot, Gaulen sailed east, crossing the great sea of Mirovia to reach the land of legend.
Gaulen and his group will be the first humans from the grand continent to walk on the sacred lands of Xulima.

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wuthrer.net/DKH_indiegogo/Ljoi98Dakla.gif"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></div>","Don’t Kill Her is a very peculiar game and
I’m dying to share its secrets with you in great detail.
Unfortunately I can’t, She won’t allow it.According to Her, the story is of no importance as you have already heard the tale in some form or fashion. Nevermind! The truth lies elsewhere, which is specifically where She yearns to lead you.This is where the fun begins, where She and I reach a common ground. No spoilers! Don't Kill Her is a delicate game. In order live its experience to the fullest one must tread lightly.Ok to be fair I‘ll admit that She’s also secretly looking forward to seeing you frown.You alone will be able to answer this tricky question… She is the master of this world into which you are invited, this is all you need to know in the beginning.Whether it be woods carved in the memories of olden days or great steppes shaped by the darkness above, the areas you are about to explore are the fruit of Her very own creation.A world conceived especially for you, it’s sole purpose being for you to find answers to the questions it raises.That’s ok, don’t worry. The important thing here is that Don’t Kill Her isn’t your typical kind of game. Its deviant aesthetics, storytelling, gameplay and music, all of these peculiar elements fit into a great design …  The true challenge lies in unraveling the mystery surrounding the game itself. If nevertheless, you find yourself assailed by terrible doubts, check out the source of inspiration below. The .gif of a bird of ill omen expiating. 










 






































Estimated delivery of physical rewards : June 2016

I have been working on Don’t Kill Her since more than two years now, struggling to balance the time required for developing this project and the financial survival of my human condition. But now the time has come to move up a gear. I believe that the most difficult part is over and I want to be able to dedicate myself fully to the game in its final stages.  Part of the funds will allow to cover my modest income but not only! Indeed even if this is kind of a solo project, I’m lucky enough to be able to count on the valuable contribution of other passionate artists.


Siddhartha Barnhoorn, inspired composer and multi-talented musician. The unbelievable array of instruments found in his quiver give life to the most exquisite sounds. See for yourself on soundcloud!

Julien Matthey is a seasoned sound designer with super muscular eardrums.  Always on the lookout for new sound effects, his will to capture the most original and whimsical sounds is a more than valuable asset for Don't Kill Her. With Julien, this whacky world has met its creative match.

Lara Ausensi lent us Her voice.  I hope this highly qualified singer and her enchanting lyricism won’t carry Her scars.

And last but not least me, Wuthrer, the twisted brain behind Don’t Kill Her (and Her obviously, constantly looking over my shoulder).
