<h3>The Pitch

</h3><h3></h3><p><b>The Three Kings of Ybor </b>is
 an intense thriller that shows how three young outlaws grow into the 
stuff of legends comparable to Jesse James and John Dillinger. However,  instead 
of slinging guns they're slinging blades and they're the best the 
world has to offer.<br/></p><p>Unlike
 most authors whose studies focused solely on English Literature, I have 
graduated with a degree in film making. This is just one of the factors that gives me an edge over my competition. I know how producers and filmmakers think because I went to a film school. Right now there is an untapped market 
open for an epic new organized crime saga with an element of 
vigilantism. <br/></p><p>Picture a more structured and influential organized crime alliance from ""The Dark Knight"" and the futuristic law enforcement tactics of ""Ghost in the Shell"" and you're coming close to it. The Three Kings of Ybor stories involves the heavy usage of advanced computer technology, cyber security tactics, cybernetic prosthetics and black market performance enhancers.<br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/927954/files/20141013162739-Ghost-in-the-Shell-620x350.jpg?1413242859"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/925141/files/20141012202616-christian-bale-dark-knight-production-stills.jpg?1413170776"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

</p><b></b>In the year 2206, after the United States becomes the American Empire and the northern hemisphere has frozen over due to nuclear warfare, the city of Tampa Bay plays host to the most powerful criminal organization in the world. The man widely believed to be the Godfather is <b>Isaac Pierce</b>, the billionaire CEO of a highly respected conglomerate. The first detective who came close to proving his alleged involvement was <b>Eliza Christie's</b> father. <br/><br/><p>Eliza is a little bit different from pious heroines like <b>Katniss of ""The Hunger Games"" </b>or <b>Beatrice Prior of ""Divergent.""</b> Eliza Christie's not helpless or lost trying to find herself and save the world. She has always been a tyrannical leader of the pack ever since
grade school, imposing her will on others and going overboard when it comes to
retaliation. Eliza tries to do the right thing...but sometimes the right thing can get in the way of revenge.</p>

that changed her life forever. Her father, an honest
detective and a rare breed from a corrupt department, sat with his back against
the trophy case. In his dying breath he kept mumbling the name of the young killer standing before him with a blood
soaked katana in hand. That name was <b>Braden
Pierce, </b>the Godfather’s favorite nephew. <br/><br/>This was the night that set the ""Three Kings of Ybor"" in motion. <br/><p></p>

<h1>How You Can Help</h1>
<p>
</p>
<p>You can help by donating as much as you like and can afford to help me
raise $6,000. ALSO!!! If you're not financially able to help, but believe in this project as much as I do,<b> I encourage you to share the link to this page to your friends, family and anyone you know who's in a position to donate. </b>To me, that's just as valuable. <br/></p>
<p>The funds raised through this Crowdfunding project will go to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>First
     edition print runs of both hardcover and paperback books</li>
<li>Legal
     and copyright fees</li>
<li>E-book
     and Kindle formatting</li>
<li>Digital
     and physical distribution</li>
<li>Design
     costs</li>
<li>Strategic
     marketing</li>
<li>Production
     of audiobook (if stretch goal of $10,000 is raised)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>By Strategic
Marketing, </b>I plan to advertise with Goodreads, Google Adsense, PR Web,
Twitter, Linkedin and Facebook. </p>
<p>I plan to attack printing two ways. The first is with
Createspace, which is a print on demand service in which I’ve already paid for
10 ISBNs needed to publishing. While I submit seven volumes to Createspace, I
plan to release the complete set, all seven volumes as one book to Infinity
Publishing.  </p>
<p><b>With Infinity
Publishing,</b> there’s a package priced at $1,675 that would release the
complete novel and include extended
global distribution to more than 50,000 book retailers through distribution
partners Baker &amp; Taylor, Ingram, Audible, iTunes and 31 online
retailers; editorial consultation with an experienced book editor; marketing
consultation with a marketing expert; and the development of a professionally
written press release to announce the availability of the book.</p>
<p>The novels I want to promote are two action-packed thrillers
focusing on organized crime and the legendary outlaws known as the <b>“Three Kings of Ybor</b>”. </p>
<p>The first novel is already written and all seven volumes are
available via <a href=""http://stageinthesky.com/kings-of-ybor/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amazon Kindle</a>. It lays the foundation on how three young killers
begin their blood-soaked journeys to rise into the stuff of legends. Over the
summer of 2014, I’ve already spent $2,000 of my own money to promote it through
press releases and facebook advertisement with good results.</p>
<p>The following picture was a campaign that I ran for just a single week on Facebook.com. As you can see, over 2,000 people have clicked on my ad to find out about the book, and of those 2,000, my audience is mostly young adults in their mid-to-young-twenties.<br/></p>

<br/><p>The second novel, “<b>The
Pierce Syndicate”</b> is a work still in progress. A 90-Page outline is already
written and I’m already five chapters into it. This story is set three years
after the tragic events of the first novel. While the first book focuses on
Eliza Christie and August the 18<sup>th</sup>, the second focuses on <b>Braden Pierce’s</b> ascent through the
ranks of the syndicate. It’s a dangerous brand of politics to be involved with,
and the situation becomes more treacherous when your enemy is your own flesh
and blood.</p>
Break it down for folks in more detail: <ul>
<li>Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you. </li> <li>Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!</li> <li>Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.</li>

 most authors whose studies focused solely on English Literature, I have 
graduated with a degree in film making. This is just one of the factors that gives me an edge over my competition. I know how producers and filmmakers think because I went to a film school. Right now there is an untapped market 
open for an epic new organized crime saga with an element of 
vigilantism. Picture a more structured and influential organized crime alliance from ""The Dark Knight"" and the futuristic law enforcement tactics of ""Ghost in the Shell"" and you're coming close to it. The Three Kings of Ybor stories involves the heavy usage of advanced computer technology, cyber security tactics, cybernetic prosthetics and black market performance enhancers.



In the year 2206, after the United States becomes the American Empire and the northern hemisphere has frozen over due to nuclear warfare, the city of Tampa Bay plays host to the most powerful criminal organization in the world. The man widely believed to be the Godfather is Isaac Pierce, the billionaire CEO of a highly respected conglomerate. The first detective who came close to proving his alleged involvement was Eliza Christie's father. Eliza is a little bit different from pious heroines like Katniss of ""The Hunger Games"" or Beatrice Prior of ""Divergent."" Eliza Christie's not helpless or lost trying to find herself and save the world. She has always been a tyrannical leader of the pack ever since
grade school, imposing her will on others and going overboard when it comes to
retaliation. Eliza tries to do the right thing...but sometimes the right thing can get in the way of revenge.
But at the spiteful age of fifteen, a traumatizing incident took place
that changed her life forever. Her father, an honest
detective and a rare breed from a corrupt department, sat with his back against
the trophy case. In his dying breath he kept mumbling the name of the young killer standing before him with a blood
soaked katana in hand. That name was Braden
Pierce, the Godfather’s favorite nephew. This was the night that set the ""Three Kings of Ybor"" in motion.

How You Can Help


You can help by donating as much as you like and can afford to help me
raise $6,000. ALSO!!! If you're not financially able to help, but believe in this project as much as I do, I encourage you to share the link to this page to your friends, family and anyone you know who's in a position to donate. To me, that's just as valuable. 
The funds raised through this Crowdfunding project will go to pay for:

First
     edition print runs of both hardcover and paperback books
Legal
     and copyright fees
E-book
     and Kindle formatting
Digital
     and physical distribution
Design
     costs
Strategic
     marketing
Production
     of audiobook (if stretch goal of $10,000 is raised)

By Strategic
Marketing, I plan to advertise with Goodreads, Google Adsense, PR Web,
Twitter, Linkedin and Facebook. 
I plan to attack printing two ways. The first is with
Createspace, which is a print on demand service in which I’ve already paid for
10 ISBNs needed to publishing. While I submit seven volumes to Createspace, I
plan to release the complete set, all seven volumes as one book to Infinity
Publishing.  
With Infinity
Publishing, there’s a package priced at $1,675 that would release the
complete novel and include extended
global distribution to more than 50,000 book retailers through distribution
partners Baker & Taylor, Ingram, Audible, iTunes and 31 online
retailers; editorial consultation with an experienced book editor; marketing
consultation with a marketing expert; and the development of a professionally
written press release to announce the availability of the book.
The novels I want to promote are two action-packed thrillers
focusing on organized crime and the legendary outlaws known as the “Three Kings of Ybor”. 
The first novel is already written and all seven volumes are
available via Amazon Kindle. It lays the foundation on how three young killers
begin their blood-soaked journeys to rise into the stuff of legends. Over the
summer of 2014, I’ve already spent $2,000 of my own money to promote it through
press releases and facebook advertisement with good results.
The following picture was a campaign that I ran for just a single week on Facebook.com. As you can see, over 2,000 people have clicked on my ad to find out about the book, and of those 2,000, my audience is mostly young adults in their mid-to-young-twenties.


The second novel, “The
Pierce Syndicate” is a work still in progress. A 90-Page outline is already
written and I’m already five chapters into it. This story is set three years
after the tragic events of the first novel. While the first book focuses on
Eliza Christie and August the 18th, the second focuses on Braden Pierce’s ascent through the
ranks of the syndicate. It’s a dangerous brand of politics to be involved with,
and the situation becomes more treacherous when your enemy is your own flesh
and blood.
Break it down for folks in more detail: 
Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.  Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited! Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.

Dragon Calling is my fantasy series which follows the adventures of a young dragon in his quest to find the others of his kind.

For those who don't know, Supanova is Australia's largest pop-culture expo, appearing annually in several cities across the states, including the Gold Coast (where I live).<br/><br/>A mega hive of all things geek/ game/ sci-fi/ and fantasy, Supanova is an amazingly crazy and awesomely fun experience. Famous actors, writers and artists from around the world come to meet their fans, and stalls containing all manner of pop-culture extravaganza are set up for attendees to splurge on.<br/><br/>It is the <i>perfect </i>place to showcase my Dragon Calling series. I love the Supanova experience, and know how many fantasy-lovers swarm to events like this (myself included). Dragon Calling will shine at such an expo, even in a little booth. It is the best chance for me to meet my target audience personally, and give my books some epic exposure. <br/><br/>Supanova attracts thousands of visitors every year. Close to 30,000 people passed through the doors of the Gold Coast Supanova in 2014. And the event just gets bigger and more popular by the year!<br/><br/>I would love to have a fully stocked booth at this year's Gold Coast Supanova!

<p><b>【為什麼我們需要你的幫助】</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>盡管我們的目標看起來十分簡單明確——發現並推廣世界文學中的精華，但要真正實現並不容易。由於我們的團隊成員分散在世界各地，我們又從不屬於任何機構或大學，《漸近線》很難爭取到合適的籌款機會。</p>
<p>於我們而言，形勢已經非常緊迫。我們致力在不同區域文學之間建立對話、維持文學的多樣性，但這些運作都花費不菲。多年來，我們一直在賠錢運作，資金壓力重重。堅持，只是因為我們確信這項事業的重要性。</p>
<p>終於，我們資金透支了。</p>
因此我們只得向你求助。我們最終決定向你求助，因為我們猜想你們和我們一樣關注《漸近線》。如果你無比相信文學翻譯的固有價值，相信世界上不同文化之間暢通無阻的思想交流，如果我們曾經無意間給予你哪怕一首讓你興奮的詩、一句你覺得有用的話，今天就請為我們捐款。<p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>【我們將用資金來做什麼】</b></p>
<p>有了你的幫助，我們將繼續為讀者們提供全程免費的線上閱讀。有了你的幫助，我們甚至可以做到更多以前做不到的，如：</p>
<p>❈  給你帶來更深層次的世界文學報道。《漸近線》一月的丹麥小說專題；四月為紀念越南戰爭五十周年特別設立的越僑專題（此次專題中我們將與羅馬尼亞和泰國的最佳刊物Steaua和Writer合作）；你也可以第一時間享受這些國家中你所不知的文壇盛宴。</p>

免費閱讀網址：www.asymptotejournal.com
文學世界的多元活力正逐漸消失，英語開始統治訊息傳遞，我們為你帶來更多不一樣的聲音：我們講述更多的語言，我們與全世界的對話。
我們來自27個國家的70位成員通過線上接力，為讀者搜尋並呈現來自世界各地精彩的文學作品，另外還有美術、音頻與影像——都可免費瀏覽。




在每一期雜誌中，我們都為大家帶來當代作家和譯者首次出版的優秀作品。去年，我們刊登了諾貝爾文學獎得主約翰·馬克斯維爾·庫切和赫塔·米勒的作品，還有2014年新加坡文學獎得主Amanda Lee Koe和2013年歐盟文學獎得主Faruk Šehić的作品。從台湾，我們呈現了羅福全傳記文學《榮町少年走天下》228事件的片段，黃麗群的短篇小說《入夢者》，來自邱妙津《蒙馬特遺書》的書評。從香港，我們呈現了王良和的詩歌《甜椒》以及李維怡的《遊園》。我們也呈現了兩位新加坡文化奖得主英培安與韓勞達的戲劇，以及政治家陳碩茂的採訪。我們還與眾多著名作家和藝術家進行了訪談，殘雪、奈良美智的訪問都以她們的母語進行，我們為了方便讀者閱讀將其翻譯為英文。在漸近線成立的四年中，我們一共為大家呈現了來自95個國家、67種語言的小說、散文、詩歌、戲劇、評論和訪談。
聯結網址：20位40歲以下最受期待的華文小說家台湾文學特輯（藝術作品由侯俊明提供）與《現在詩》編輯夏宇、鴻鴻、零雨、阿翁、曾淑美的專訪陳建忠《台灣製造的文學品味──2011年的台灣小說》黃春明《有一隻懷錶》短篇小說楊牧的現代詩饒加恩的影像藝術作品香港文學雜誌《字花》與漸近線的共同合作














「語言沒有中心點，《漸近線》也一樣：就像翻譯本身，這是一張流動的巨網，向所有方向伸展開來，變化、收縮、再次伸展，然后把文本和讀者帶到一起，透過不可思議的神奇聯繫。」
——喬納森·利特爾，龔古爾文學獎得主
【我們去年做了什麼】
去年，我們在美國眾籌網站Indiegogo上共募得20184美元。我們將這些心意轉換為實際行動，為大家帶來了：
❈  一幅文學地圖，可以通過點擊對應的國家，來搜尋往期作品。
❈ 每日博客，提供最新全球文學資訊。
❈  「無限趨近」（Close
Approximations）——我們為新生代譯者舉辦的翻譯大賽，由資深翻譯家艾略特·溫伯格（墨西哥劇作家帕斯及中國詩人北島作品英譯者）及葛浩文（諾貝爾文學獎得主莫言作品英譯者，《漸近線》特約編輯之一）分別負責詩歌組與小說組評審。獎金共計3000美元。
❈  我們在四大洲舉辦了14場文學活動（首次將我們的全球對話帶到了波士頓、哥本哈根、香港、悉尼、上海和薩格勒布）。


過去的一年精彩紛呈，盡管未來還有許多地方需要花銷，我們依舊會為廣大讀者提供免費無廣告的無限次閱讀。


「多元的翻譯對象讓人印象深刻——烏爾都語的書評，孟加拉語的小說，法羅群語的詩歌——然而該刊本身讓人印象更深。」

【我們將用資金來做什麼】
有了你的幫助，我們將繼續為讀者們提供全程免費的線上閱讀。有了你的幫助，我們甚至可以做到更多以前做不到的，如：
❈  給你帶來更深層次的世界文學報道。《漸近線》一月的丹麥小說專題；四月為紀念越南戰爭五十周年特別設立的越僑專題（此次專題中我們將與羅馬尼亞和泰國的最佳刊物Steaua和Writer合作）；你也可以第一時間享受這些國家中你所不知的文壇盛宴。








❈  在教育領域發展世界文學。全世界的老師可以將《漸近線》納入他們的課程計劃，培養下一代讀者對於世界文學的熱愛。

<p>I've written a screenplay, titled KILL ALL THE LAWYERS, in which a lot of lawyers get killed! WHA HAHAHAHA!</p>
<p>It's a dark, dazzling dramedy.</p>
<p>In my dreams, I see Johnny Depp and Lady Gaga in the lead roles, with Terry Gilliam directing.</p>
<p>The story starts with 365 lawyers being incinerated. After that, three more lawyers are killed, but not burned to death, by the arsonist.</p>
<p>Those dead lawyers can bear the names of the lawyers you hate. Any sleazy miscreant lawyer - perhaps an ex husband or wife? - who managed to screw you over can be killed off in my soon-to-be cinema classic</p>
<p>Or, YOU can kill as many lawyers as you want! There's a scene in the story where a person goes nuts and slaughters a whole office full of lawyers. That person can be YOU! Those lawyers can be your lawyers.</p>
<p>Minimum price - $1000 per lawyer, or $2000 to be the killer and name the lawyers you want to kill.</p>
<p>I'll email you the script, so you can see how and why your lawyer will be killed. Murders can be customized, although I'm sure you'll all want the slow, extremely painful and preferably humiliating fashion.</p>
<p>I'm trying to raise money to cover my living expenses while I transform the screenplay into a novel and simultaneously shop the script.</p>
<p>Obviously, I can't guarantee that the screen version will ever be produced but a book will be completed and sold as an ebook for $1. You can have as many ebooks as you desire.</p>
<p>Book will be available no later than December 23, 2013, just in time for Christmas. </p>
<p><br/>HUBBA HUBBA, boys and girls, let's slaughter those stinking swine already!</p>
<h3>This is how the screenplay opens:</h3>
<p><strong>Scene 1           Disclaimer </strong><strong>     </strong></p>
<p>A lawyer walks into the camera’s view. He has some papers in his hands. He clears his throat and starts speaking</p>
<p align=""center"">LAWYER</p>
<p>Before we can allow you watch this film we must take a number of legal precautions.</p>
<p>This is a work of fiction. It is a potentially dangerous piece of art. It is, in no way, meant to incite you, the viewer, to kill, or in any way harm, one or more lawyers.</p>
<p>By purchasing a ticket to watch this movie you have entered  into an implicit contract that indemnifies everyone who had a role in the production and/or distribution and/or promotion of the film against any legal action that may result from damages, physical or financial, that you, the viewer, may visit upon one or more lawyers, at any time in the future, at any location on this or any other planet.</p>
<p>Should you, the viewer, while watching the film, or at any time thereafter, feel a strong urge to run amok, slaughtering lawyers, you are strongly advised to seek professional help from a qualified mental health professional.</p>
<p>The preceding sentence is in no way to be construed as a libelous, actionable questioning of your present, past or future sanity.</p>
<p>Now, if you would be so kind as to raise your right hands, and repeat after me…</p>
<p>The lawyer fumbles his papers and drops them to the floor. The papers are all connected, like the old dot matrix printers used to use. The pile of papers is very long</p>
<p align=""center"">LAWYER      </p>
<p>…we can get on with the show. Should you have any questions about the following contractual pledge, we advise you to leave the theater immediately and consult a lawyer</p>
<p>Shakespeare, comes out and shoots the lawyer in the face before saying</p>
<p align=""center"">SHAKESPEARE</p>
<p align=""center"">Fuckin’ lawyers. Alright, on with the show!</p>
<p><strong>Scene 2           Young Pablo gets an idea</strong></p>
<p>Young Pablo is in a juvenile detention facility, behind bars. He’s reading Henry VI and laughing. Camera comes in tight on the line, “First thing we do is KILL ALL THE LAWYERS.” Pablo laughs maniacally</p>
<p><strong>Scene 3           Opening credits </strong></p>
<p>Opening credits roll over the screen as a gang of lawyers rape Lady Justice</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>so, while i'm trying to figure out how to drive raffic to this campaign, and raise money, i'm going to proceed with the transformation and post my efforts here</p>
<p>Surely someone, somewhere has, at some point, attempted something similar to what I’m about to try, but here it goes, anyway. I’m going to “talk to you” in the story. And I’m going explain to you what I’ve done, and why I did it, after each chapter.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">CHAPTER 1</span></strong></p>
<p>Some FBI schmuck was staring at an NSA babe and thinking of a sexually deviant congressman he’d arrested six years earlier. The NSA babe was talking to another FBI schmuck, who was probably thinking of sexual deviance that had nothing to do with a congressman. “So, why did the Muslim terrorists burn 350 lawyers to death,” the girl asked the other FBI schmuck.</p>
<p>The congressman was yet another one of those upstanding middle class Americans who campaigned, vociferously and perpetually, for ‘family values’ - whatever the fuck that means these days - while secretly pondering how much elasticity there was in the Ten Commandments and all those Sunday morning sermons he’d managed to sit through since his childhood.<br/><br/> The FBI schmuck hadn’t been tipped off to the congressman’s perversions. The congressman was not under investigation when he got caught, literally, with his pants down at a high school football game. The congressman had simply lost his mind for a moment. He wasn’t even drunk. And he’d probably have gone on to a long career in politics, if not for the fact that the FBI schmuck saw him, out of the corner of his eye, as he was pulling his pud while staring out onto the field from a dark corner of the stadium on a Friday night.</p>
<p>The FBI schmuck didn’t even know the congressman was a congressman when he snuck up behind him and slapped the cuffs on him. The congressman had been pulling it hard for a couple minutes. He’d rounded third and was heading home when the FBI schmuck had grabbed him by the back of the neck (no, I am not guilty of mixing my metaphors because the football story is a true story and the baseball analogy is a metaphor, dumbass).</p>
<p>The congressman spilled his seed the second the FBI schmuck collared him. He was tugging with his right hand and splooged on his left hand. The FBI schmuck was unaware that the congressman’s left hand was covered in a prodigious amount of man chowder until their left hands made contact, as the cop reached around to pull the pervert’s hand behind his back. Once the cuffs were locked, the FBI schmuck examined his hand and HOLY FUCK was he <em>disgusted</em>. So disgusted that he kicked the cuffed congressman to the ground and started laying the boots to the pervert.</p>
<p>When the congressman pitifully cried out, “Stop! I am a United States congressman,” the cop was stunned. The copper ceased the assault and laughed. Then he found the pervert’s wallet. He pulled out the driver’s license and called his station. Sure as hell, the creep was a congressman.</p>
<p>When the congressman went to trial, he swore up and down on a stack of bibles that he was staring at the <em>cheerleaders</em>, a single specific cheerleader, in fact, <em>not</em> the football players, when he was, for a horrible moment, “caught in a trap laid by Satan himself.”</p>
<p>It was, in the judge’s mind, vitally important that he be absolutely sure on this point. For, if the congressman was, in fact, fantasizing about having his way with one of the football players, he was going to do some serious time.</p>
<p> If, on the other hand, he had been bewitched by one of the ‘rah rah sis boom bah, I <em>know </em>you wanna fuck me, oolala!’ teasing, tarty teens, he would cut the poor fool some slack. ‘I’ll give him a couple years,’ thought the judge, staring at the congressman’s buxom cougar of a wife and thinking impure thoughts. ‘Perhaps wifey over there will show some gratitude.’</p>
<p>In order to believe the congressman’s charges of witchery, the judge ordered the girl in question to make an appearance in court. The girl, all of fifteen, could have been traumatized by the attention, but she was not that kind of girl. She <em>lived</em> for the attention and she got more than any other girl in town, by a country mile.  The second the FBI schmuck saw the girl in court he felt bad for the congressman. She was a dead-on strumpet. None of that girl next door bullshit. The fucking harlot showed up wearing a Hello Kitty tube top, a micro mini and a pair of thigh-high fuck-me-hard fuck-me-now boots. In court! The fuckin’ whore!</p>
<p>The congressman got two years, less a day, the judge got the congressman’s wife, the tart got the front page of the paper three days in a row, and the FBI schmuck got on with his life.</p>
<p>And now, six years later, here was that bewitching babe, all grown up and standing ten feet in front of him, sipping a coffee and shooting the shit with some other FBI schmuck. He was pretty sure it was her. It <em>had to be</em> her.</p>
<p>“So, why did the Muslim terrorists burn 350 lawyers to death,” the girl asked the other FBI schmuck. The other FBI schmuck smiled and shrugged.</p>
<p>“Because Allah fucking Akbar, baby!” roared the girl. The two of them exploded in laughter and high fived.</p>
<p>Just then, Phil Head walked into the room. Head looked at the clock. Seven a.m. on the dot. Right on time. “Okay, everyone, shut the fuck up.” Everyone shut the fuck up. “The Mayor brings greetings from the President.” Mayor Jose Cuervo walked into the room, five feet behind Head. </p>
<p>The Mayor was a big, fat Mexican. Shut up. Don’t tell me I can’t say he was a big, fat Mexican, because he <em>was</em> a big, fat Mexican. A big, fat, jolly Mexican. Cuervo was a funny guy. Funny as in hahaha funny. He excelled at taking the piss out of himself (in case you don’t know, that’s how a Brit would say he had a habit of engaging in self-deprecating humour and was very good at it – if you don’t know what that means, Google it).</p>
<p>Cuervo weighed 270 pounds when he first became Mayor of New York City, two years earlier. Trailing his main opponent by as much as 27 points with a month left in the campaign, Cuervo gambled his whole political career on a joke. He convinced his friend, the head of the Bronx Zoo, to let him shoot a faux candid video with the elephants.</p>
<p>It was claimed that the video was shot by a pair of tourists from Japan. The couple just happened to stumble across Cuervo at the elephant enclosure, where, get this, the elephants were throwing peanuts to the fat Mexican. Cuervo was catching, shelling and eating the peanuts. And<em> laughing</em>! Jose Cuervo, a big, fat Mexican was laughing like a gas-huffing hippopotamus. It was a deep, booming, baritone, infectious laugh. His laughter set the Japs (oh, fuck you, I can so  say Japs) giggling in a high pitch. Combined, the trio’s laughter proved to be more infectious than SARS</p>
<p>The female of Nipponese oriental persuasion (there, you happy?) asked Cuervo, “What you do?”</p>
<p>To which Cuervo replied, “What it look I do? I eating peanuts.” The Japs (yeah, yeah, fuck you, go back to reading Mother Jones, ‘cause you ain’t gonna dig the rest of this yearn) giggled and giggled. Cuervo snorted laughter and said, “I’m so fat that when I go to the zoo, the elephants feed <em>me </em>peanuts.”</p>
<p>The video went viral over night. Cuervo claimed that he had been so distraught about his political plight that he went to see, “the only fuckers in New York that are fatter than me,” to ask their advice. And when he started asking questions, the elephants felt his sadness and decided to cheer him up by feeding him their peanuts. It was, he said, a transcendental experience.</p>
<p>Even the New York Times, <em>the New York fuckin; Times</em>, my friends – a paper so stiff that it had never even printed the word fun in its august pages in its entire history – was so thoroughly charmed that it loosened up and dubbed him Elephant Man. The Post trumped that by declaring him Mayor Elephant Man.</p>
<p>Cuervo rode earthquakes of laughter and waves of awwww! all the way to the Mayor’s office.</p>
<p>Saying that it was important for him to be seen in the city’s eateries, Cuervo had put on another 50 pounds by the time he waddled into the room. He was a dead ringer for Ralph Steadman’s drawings of Hunter S Thompson’s 300 pound Samoan lawyer in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Yeah, the big, fat  Mexican looked like a Samoan cartoon. Don’t all big, fat Mexicans look the same as big, fat Samoans? Well, they do to me.</p>
<p>The Mayor understood the gravity of the situation – more than 350 lawyers had been incinerated when some kind of evil genius arsonist had torched the New York State Bar Association Annual General Meeting the day before. This was supposed to be a dour, dead serious briefing. Gathered before him were the best available agents of the FBI, CIA, NSA, and NYPD.</p>
<p>Cuervo started well, “I’ve just returned from meeting the President at the Whitehouse. She has asked me to head up this joint task force.”</p>
<p>That meeting had not gone well. Although he had backed her bid for the Presidency, Cuervo did not like the Nation’s first female President. She was, to put it mildly, a humourless cunt. Cuervo once quipped, in an off-the-record drinking session with a couple journalists, that she was so wound up that she could crack walnuts with her sphincter.</p>
<p>The President had summoned the Mayor to the Whitehouse the minute she heard about the inferno. A lawyer herself, she wanted to ride the point on this one. The Mayor wanted to wear the white hat. He knew that some of her good friends had been roasted, and that made her the wrong person to round up a posse and start hunting. “Dirty Harry with tits,’ he thought to himself when he saw her.</p>
<p>In the end, Mayor Cuervo convinced the President to let him run this circus.</p>
<p>But no matter how he tried, the Mayor just couldn’t feel the pain. Like most everyone else, Cuervo<em> hated</em> lawyers. He even hated his mother, a lawyer, and you know how Mexicans are about their mothers… or, is that Italians. Well, you know, Italians, Mexicans, Samoans, what’s the difference?</p>
<p>So, as he stood before his task force<strong>, </strong>he couldn’t resist the temptation to crack wise.</p>
<p>“She’s asked me to congratulate those of you who lost your lawyers in the liar’s pyre, yesterday, and say better luck next time to those of you who did not.”</p>
<p>The room exploded with laughter. Cuervo knew how to play a room, although he need not have been The Amazing Kreskin to figure out that his audience didn’t have much liking for lawyers, either.</p>
<p>“Okay,” said Cuervo, “that’s the last dead lawyer joke I want to hear,” but, again, he couldn’t      resist, “… unless you’ve got a really good one.”</p>
<p>The NSA babe didn’t hesitate for a second, “Why did the Muslim terrorists burn 350 lawyers to death?’ Cuervo knew he was gonna<em> love</em> the punchline. He already wished it were<em> his</em> joke. He smiled, shrugged and waited.</p>
<p>The FBI schmuck, who had busted the pervy congressman, had always been a shameless suck-up to authority figures. He saw an opportunity to curry favour with the Mayor and pounced before the NSA babe could spit out the punchline, “Because Allah fucking Akbar, baby!”</p>
<p>It worked. The Mayor howled with laughter, a s did the rest of the room. Only the NSA babe remained silent. She was <em>pissed</em>. The FBI schmuck instantly understood that he was not going to get so much as a whiff of the babe’s fuck-me-hard fuck-me-now boots. But he didn’t care because the Mayor, Mayor Jose Cuervo, had laughed at <em>his</em> joke.</p>
<p>“Okay, everyone settle down,” said the Mayor. “Seriously. That’s it for the dead lawyer jokes. The official death toll now stands at 358. Going up in flames is a horrible way to die… even for lawyers.</p>
<p>“It falls to you to find out who is responsible and to bring them to justice.</p>
<p>“Phil Head, here, will be overseeing the investigation and reporting directly to myself and the President.</p>
<p>“I’ll leave you all to get better acquainted and get to work.”</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>And that’s the last you’ll see of the FBI schmucks and the NSA babe. They are so unimportant to this story that they didn’t even get names. The vast majority of this chapter was a pointless exercise in page filling. The “because Allah fucking Akbar, baby,” joke came to me and I had to create something to put it in.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I need to establish the farcical side of this story right from the start because, if some nut case actually goes out and starts killing lawyers, after reading this, or watching the movie, I’m not gonna do time for it.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Back in 94, in Vancouver, I wrote a piece in Terminal City titled Booze Up and Riot. In the piece I encouraged readers to booze up and riot on the night the Canucks should have won the Stanley Cup. The Canucks lost, but the riot erupted anyway.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The cops investigated me and the mag and contemplated laying charges against myself and the editor. Eventually, the cops decided not to attempt a prosecution against us. The police report stated:</li>
</ul><p><em>""SALMI is known to the author as a person with extreme views, a high intellect but a non-violent and a bark worse than his bite… Very few intelligent readers take SALMI seriously. However, he writes with great conviction and in the language of the street to the extent that persons of street-level intellect might take him seriously.”</em></p>
<p>The report continues<em>, ""SALMI wrote this article with a tongue-in-cheek attitude perhaps with no intent to actually incite the riot. He may not have realized what the consequences of his actions might have been.""</em></p>
<p>Most importantly, it concludes<em>, ""<strong>given the ridiculous nature of the entire article,""</strong> it would be next to impossible to take it seriously enough to recommend charges be brought.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>In the screenplay version of this story, I immediately establish the all-important “ridiculous nature” of the entire work in the first scene, when Shakespeare comes out and shoots the lawyer</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>That scene doesn’t work in a book, so I need to open with something that immediately establishes the all-important “ridiculous nature” of it all, and that’s why I’m leading with the “Allah Fucking Akbar, baby!” joke and a big, fat Mexican mayor of NYC, named Jose Cuervo, cracking wise after a terrorist attack</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>No matter how serious this story gets, and all good socio-political satire must have a serious side to it, this is a joke, so fuck off if you think you’re going to make any criminal charges stick against me</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Most books are full of filler. I generally disdain filler but I’m playing around with the concept, hoping that I can at least make my filler somewhat entertaining, unlike the miles of meandering, meaningless mumbo-jumbo that many meandering, meaningless writers spew forth.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>You will see Mayor Jose Cuervo again, but not for a while. And you’re not going to like him nearly as much as you do now.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Flip the page and you get to meet the female star of this story, Jane Baker. Jane looks exactly like Lady Gaga. Jane gets fucked in the next chapter, Jane gets fucked a fair bit I this book. Do you think she gets fucked in the ass? Do you want her to get fucked in the ass?</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<ul>
<li>If Lady Gaga doesn’t work for you, picture Jane as someone else. Gwen Stefani, maybe? Oh, fuck, what the fuck do I care? Make her look like you for all I give a fuck.</li>
</ul><p>****</p>
<p> <strong>CHAPTER 2</strong></p>
<p>Jane was all of 12 years old when her mother muttered 15 words that stuck with her for the rest of her life. It was mom’s turn to host Martini Monday, the monthly meeting of The Coven of Bitter, Childless Post-menopausal Witches, of which she was an honourary member, and the old crones were in fine form. Jane’s mother was holding court, telling the ladies of her latest conquest, while Jane was serving canapés. “A good man is hard to find,” mom mumbled after quaffing a multitude of martinis, “but a <em>hard</em> man is good to find!” The coven cackled cacophonously and mom pointed a crooked finger at Jane and said, “Always remember that, Jane.”</p>
<p>Jane always remembered that.</p>
<p>Once again, her mother’s words echoed in Jane’s mind as she awoke on the morning after the Liar’s Pyre to discover that her still slumbering husband was endowed with glorious morning wood. As Jane espied hubby’s prodigious pole, a small whimper of excitement escaped her. “A hard man <em>is </em>good to find!” Jane thought, as she slid down the bed to behold the engorged serpent.</p>
<p>Jane flicked her tongue lightly across the serpent head. Hubby squirmed, just a bit, still not waking, as the snake first twitched, then throbbed. Delighted, Jane licked her lips and went to work.</p>
<p>Over the 14 years that had passed since the moment Jane’s mother had mumbled the magical words that changed the girl’s life forever, Jane had sucked a mile of cock. Six inches, four inches, eight inches, ten inches, tree-trunk fat, drumstick thin, helmet-heads and anteaters, Jane loved them all, despite what she thought of the guys attached to them.</p>
<p>In the process of her hands-on and mouth-open education, Jane had long ago tamed the troublesome gag reflex, so she had no trouble swallowing the throbbing serpent whole. Hubby snapped into a state of consciousness instantly. The only thing he could see was the top of Jane’s head. He was not displeased with the view.</p>
<p>Jane held him in her throat, breathing through her nose. He bucked instinctively, but she pinned his hips to the bed with her forearms and held him still for ten seconds before disgorging his manhood. Jane stared her prey straight in the eye and emitted a low, throaty growl before swallowing the serpent one more time.</p>
<p>Hubby grabbed her by the hair and fucked her face ferociously. Jane thrashed like a wild animal caught in a trap. Her body was out of control, arms flailing, legs spasming. Locked into a primal sexual frenzy, Jane’s mind was devoid of thought. She broke free from his hold, just as he was about to erupt, and hissed, “Fuck me!”</p>
<p>In less than a second his hands were back in her hair. He pulled her head with both his hands and slammed her on her back. Jane rose up on her shoulder blades, hips thrashing in the air, screaming, “Fuck me! Fuck me!”</p>
<p>Hubby thrust his nine inches into Jane’s quivering tunnel and fucked her like a Klingon. He pulled her hair, slapped her face and spat on her, “Take it, you fucking whore.”</p>
<p>“Fuck me!” Jane panted. “Fuck me harder, you fucking caveman. FUCK ME!”</p>
<p>And, just like that, it was over. Hubby shuddered for a moment, fell silent for another moment, and then, in the throes of post orgasmic revulsion, scowled “Look at you! You disgust me, you fucking pig.”</p>
<p>He rolled off of her and began to dress, hastily.</p>
<p>“Hey!” Jane protested.</p>
<p>“I’m a busy man, Jane. I don’t have time to wait around for your orgasm. I have to take a deposition in half an hour.</p>
<p>Jane fumed, silently, unfulfilled, as her husband departed.</p>
<p>****</p>

<li>I have no idea if that works or not. It is the first time I've made any effort to write a sex scene. I don't feel cheap and/or dirty! There's a lot more sex to come in this tale, so I'll have to work on it.</li>
But there, my friends, is your female star. In the scriptm, this comes before the first meeting of the task force, which is, for the moment at least, CHAPTER 1 of the book</ul><ul>
<li><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">While I was writing the screenplay, I attempted to watch AND JUSTICE FOR ALL,  a 1979 flick starring Al Pacino. Pacino was nominated for the best actor Oscar, and the film was also short-listed for BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY. I liked it when it forst came out but I could not get throughthe first half hour when I tried to watch it again. Talk about PLODDING!</span></li>

<li>I want to clearly establish jane as a highly sexual creature right from the start. If not consciously, I want people to be craving more sex subconsciously and by throwing this scene in at the begining I want them thinkng that I have promised them more sex</li>

<li>I also want to make it clear that Jane is married to a lawyer and it is not going as well as she might like.</li>
</ul><p>CHAPTER 3</p>
<p>Twenty-six year old Jane Baker, blond, beautiful, bright and extremely ambitious, sipped a coffee as she walked into the office of Pius Akecheta, a captain in NYPD’s homicide department. She threw her copy of the first edition of the New York Post on Akecheta’s desk and asked, “What the fuck do you make of this, chief?”</p>
<p>Akecheta, a Mohawk Indian from upstate New York, looked at the 120 point headline on the front page – LAWYERS BURN IN ‘HELL’ - and answered, “I’d say the Post’s headline writers have outdone themselves this time.”</p>
<p>Jane agreed, “Yeah, it’s a beauty. Al Queda?”</p>
<p>“If it was, they just went from zeroes to heroes in the eyes of a lot of Americans. They keep this up and they will quickly become exactly what this country needs.”</p>
<p>“What’s that, chief?”</p>
<p>“A  legitimate third party.”</p>
<p>Jane chuckled. “You know the problem with Islam?”</p>
<p>Akecheta, an often-conflicted yet still marginally devout Catholic, scribbled NUKE MECCA on a scratch pad, chuckled and said, “No, but I know what the solution is.”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>Akecheta put his pen down, looked up at Jane and said, “Never mind. What‘s the problem with Islam?”</p>
<p>“The Muslim world never underwent an Age of Enlightenment. Science and reason never beat fanaticism into the dark shadows of disrepute. Had that happened, Muslim fanatics would be far less dangerous. They'd be on a par with our Christian lunatics.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, boss. Your people kept slaughtering an entire continent while you were getting enlightened, and you’ve kept right on subjugating and slaughtering indigenous peoples all around the world ever since.”</p>
<p>Jane, an agnostic, looked at the cross dangling from Akecheta’s neck, thought about bringing up The Crusades, but decided to give it a pass. “How’d they do it?” she said, pointing to the front page  photo of charred corpses being removed from the site of the Liar’s Pyre, “Whoever <em>they</em> are?”</p>
<p>“Divine guidance?”</p>
<p>“Your good Lord hates lawyers?”</p>
<p>“Why do you think he created Hell?”</p>
<p>“Well, leaving aside Al Queda, your good Lord, and an overzealous Shakespeare fan with his moon in Dante, what should we be looking for, here?”</p>
<p>“Dick.”</p>
<p>“I’m not looking for Dick”</p>
<p>The Mohawk gave Jane a once-over. Tight skirt, plunging neckline on her top, two-inch heels. “Your attire says different.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have time for this. I have to be in court in an hour.”</p>
<p>“Pablo Fiasco”</p>
<p>“The artist?”</p>
<p>“He prefers to be referred to as the <em>smar</em>tist.”</p>
<p>“What about him?”</p>
<p>“Just a hunch. A wild guess. I know something you don’t. What <em>do you</em> know about him?”</p>
<p>“Not much. Enfant terrible of the art world. Pretty boy”</p>
<p>Akecheta pulled up Fiasco’s Wikipedia page on his computer. “Le grande enfant terrible. He created a video game called Kill God.” Akecheta noticed Jane’s smile but let it go. “The game starts with the Archangel Michael making an appearance in Hell to have a talk with his lost brother, Satan. Michael informs Satan that God has lost his nut. He is going to smite all Earthly disbelievers and create a thousand year <em>Reich</em>, during which anyone who so much as looks at him sideways gets burned to ashes.”</p>
<p>“Burned to ashes?” Jane said. “Really? Just like all those lawyers.”</p>
<p>“Correct. Just like all those lawyers. Anyway, Satan shakes his head in disbelief and summons Jesus, who, apparently, is a guest in Hell. Satan explains the situation and commands Jesus to go forth and Kill God. “</p>
<p>“Well, every boy wants to kill his father, at some point.”</p>
<p>Akecheta searched his mind and remembered that he did, indeed, want to kill his father, on a number of occasions. He pushed those memories aside and continued. “Jesus starts the battle at his birth and moves forward through time. Along the way he must smite those who have killed, or harmed, in his name, in order to get to the next level – the crusaders, the mobs at the Salem Witch Trials, pedophile priests. In his last battle before he gets to Heaven, to go mano a mano with his old man, Jesus must slaughter the Pope. <em>Mercilessly</em>. With <em>extreme</em> malice.”</p>
<p>“Let me guess; that heresy was a winner?”</p>
<p>“He’s still making a fortune from that one. At any given time you’ll find a million or so reprobates playing live, online, at killgod dot com.” Jane, who came from an entrepreneurial family, resisted the temptation to praise Pablo’s ambition and success, and Akecheta continued.</p>
<p>“He fronted an avant-garde, underground, surf-metal band called Something Wicked this way Comes. “</p>
<p>“Ray Bradbury,” said Jane, strutting her literary knowledge.</p>
<p>The cop was impressed, but not surprised. He had nothing but respect for Jane’s brains. The two of them had formed a mutual admiration society since they’d crossed paths, a year earlier. They’d gotten into the habit of impressing each other with their knowledge of literature. The Indian quickly quipped, “Bradbury got it from Shakespeare. Macbeth. Act four, scene one. ‘By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.’”</p>
<p>Jane knew the line, and was disappointed that she’d never realized that Bradbury had stolen the name of his classic from The Bard. But the girl was not to be outdone by the cop. “And Bradbury got pissed at Michael Moore for Farenheit 911? That’s funny.”</p>
<p>Jane was well aware of Akecheta’s deep respect for Moore, so before he could start on yet another  fawning of the man’s works she checked her watch and twirled her index finger. Akecheta took the queue.</p>
<p>“Like Henry Rollins before him, he got bored with rock ‘n’ roll and gave it up for something more edgy. Something with a little more intellectual gravitas, I believe, is the way he put it. He became Homopope.”</p>
<p>“Homopope?” Jane said, stealing a look at a pic of Pablo on the computer screen.”He’s gay?”</p>
<p>“No. He’s a fuck-shit-upper. Just loves to fuck shit up. Gay? I don’t think so.”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Nothing.”</p>
<p>Akecheta raised an eyebrow but resisted the temptation to pull the thread. “Or… who knows? Maybe he is. But he pandered to the gay community. He went after the Catholic Church in a <em>very</em> disrespectful manner.</p>
<p>“He would set up shop outside Catholic churches, on Sunday mornings, wearing a Papal mitre and bondage gear.”</p>
<p>Jane could not resist smiling. The often-conflicted Catholic ignored her grin, and continued, “He would taunt parishioners by quoting Jesus –‘ If anyone says, I love God, but hates the brothers or sisters, he is a liar...Whoever loves God must also love the brothers and sisters.’</p>
<p>“Later in the day, he would hold court at gay brunches, where he would take confessions and offer absolutions for all the sinful acts of debauchery that were committed the night before. He recorded all those filthy, lurid confessions and made them available to homopope.com subscribers. Made a fortune.”</p>
<p>Akecheta continued. “When Benny the 16th got called to the great gig in the sky, Homopope raised a queer army and marched on the Vatican.”</p>
<p>Jane said, “Yes. I remember that. Blood in the streets.”</p>
<p>“Close,” said Akecheta. “Ten thousand screaming fags parked themselves in St. Peter’s Square, and prayed for pink smoke. They chanted, ‘Pink smoke! Homopope! Pink smoke! Homopope!’</p>
<p>“Italian soccer hooligans didn’t care for that much. Nor did the mafia. Offended their mothers. The Italian army had to be called in to prevent a massacre. The Cardinals were forced to appeal for calm to prevent bloodshed. They also had to pick a new Pope double plus quick to put an end to what was, for the Catholic Church, a nightmarish circus.”</p>
<p>Jane had a lightbulb moment, “That stunt may have had a big effect. Maybe Pope Franky was thinking of Homopope whe he started to ask who is he to judge gays.”</p>
<p>When Akecheta said nothing, it occurred to Jane that he might be enough of a mindless follower to relinquish his right to freedom of thought, and surrender to the dictates of the Vatican. She was a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>Akecheta’s mind twitched in confusion.  He did not hate gays, despite the fact that he had been taught to. But it was clear that the Church had no use for them. The Vatican had not softened its hardline against homosexuality, when other Christian churches had. Then, along came the new Latino Pope signaling a major change in direction. And here was this… this <em>girl</em>, suggesting that <em>Homopope</em> may have influenced the Vatican’s thinking. The conflicted Catholic could neither add nor subtract, multiply nor divide. He could not do the math. He was well and truly tharned.</p>
<p>Akecheta snapped out his state of mental paralysis but was still unable to mount a comeback, and he was visibly annoyed.</p>
<p>Jane mistakenly assumed her friend was pissed at her. She’d had enough man shit for one day, thank you very much, and lacked the patience to deal with any more, so she delivered what she hoped would be a coup de grace, “You Catholics should concern yourselves far less with what transpires in the bedrooms of consenting adults, and far more with your pedophile priests.”</p>
<p>Akecheta had heard it before, of course, and he was ready with a response, “Did you ever stop to think that maybe Satan is behind all that business?</p>
<p>“Satan?”</p>
<p>“If you were Satan, or even Satanic, would you not attempt to tempt the Lord’s messengers, in order to discredit the Lord?”</p>
<p>Jane rolled her eyes. “So, every child raping priest can get himself exonerated by saying the devil made him do it?”</p>
<p>“We will all be judged in a higher court.”</p>
<p>Jane shook her head. Her friend Pius was getting a little too Pious for the good of the discussion. “Okay, Fiasco’s a social deviant and a heretic. So what?” Jane twirled her finger.</p>
<p>“He’ll burn in Hell. He’s a vile degenerate, a filthy blasphemer,” said Pius, before conceding, “But a fuckin’ eh smart one.”</p>
<p>Jane twirled her index finger again. “Yes. The <em>smart</em>ist. What else?”</p>
<p>­­­­ “He started the whole mail order groom business, with groom with a broom dot com. He saw that women, in this advanced age of sexual liberation, were ready to start treating men, or boys, the same way they have been treated for eons. He understood that the ladies wanted a man who could cook, clean and fuck their lights out.”</p>
<p>Jane had heard of Groom with a Broom.  She laughed, “And every cougar with a six figure salary, and/or bank balance, divorced her fat, old, impotent husband and bought herself a third-world groom with a broom?”</p>
<p>“All of whom have donkey dicks, no doubt!” Akecheta added.</p>
<p>“Nice! What’s he doing these days?”</p>
<p>“The world is waiting to see his next lurid collection of vile paintings.”</p>
<p>The feline’s finger twirled in the air.</p>
<p>“For the past decade and a half, he’s been painting scenes of Popes getting together to… ummm… sexually blaspheme Jesus.”</p>
<p>Jane was fully aware that the big Mohawk had legally changed his name to Pius Akecheta. Akecheta was the Mohawk name for Fighter. There had been 12 Popes named Pius. She understood that any person who had changed his name to embrace a dozen Popes would be sensitive about his namesakes. She proceeded with caution.</p>
<p>“Bukkake Baby Jesus. I’ve heard about this,” she said, matter of factly. </p>
<p>The Catholic noted her change of tone. He mentally acknowledged that she was backing off, and carried on. “Yeah. Even Damien Hirst was shocked and appalled.”</p>
<p>Jane did not show any indication that she knew the name Damien Hirst. Akecheta smugly chalked up a point for himself. “He puts a handful of Popes together in one painting. They’ve arrived at the nativity scene in a time machine. All of them are splooging on baby Jesus.”</p>
<p>Jane laughed out loud. The cop looked back at his computer screen, pretending he had not heard her, and carried on. “He hopes to get all 265 Popes into the paintings before he dies. His justification for this filth is that, according to him, the policies and practices of the Catholic Church are defiling the message and spirit of Christ.</p>
<p>“Well, he has an argument.”</p>
<p>“What the fuck would you know about it?”</p>
<p>“Settle down, chief. At least he’s ambitious.”</p>
<p>“Hell is filled with ambitious souls.”</p>
<p>Jane mentally acknowledged his contempt and bowed down to it. “Amen, brother. When is his next BBJ show scheduled?”</p>
<p>“No one knows. Probably not even him. I think he’s been sidetracked with his latest project.”</p>
<p>“Which is?”</p>
<p>“Jawjaw.”</p>
<p>“The… talking thing?”</p>
<p>The cop lost a point or two of respect for Jane. He not so subtly mocked her, “ Right. The… <em>talking thing</em>. He realized that people who are practically living online really do want to meet, and have interesting conversations with, real live people. He’s giving them the opportunity.</p>
<p>“And they are availing themselves of the opportunity?”</p>
<p>“More than two hundred franchises opened up across the country in the first nine months, and he’s about to take the concept global.</p>
<p>Jane  looked at her watch, twirled her finger. She was about to say something when her phone rang. “Okay, on my way.” She turned to Akecheta and said, “You still haven’t told me anything.”</p>
<p>“I don’t<em> have</em> anything. It’s just a hunch. And I don’t always tell you everything.”</p>
<p>“Why do you know so much about him?”</p>
<p>The cop looked at her and pondered whether or not he should answer the question, before doing so, “I’m on a mission.”</p>
<p>Jane opened her eyes <em>wide</em>. “From <em>God</em>?”</p>
<p>“I’m buying a stairway to heaven.”</p>
<p>Jane rolled her eyes. “You’ll be asked to be on the investigating task force. Pass on it. Tell them your caseload is already too daunting. But tell them that you can join later, when you’ve cleared some things off your plate. That way, they’ll keep you in the loop.”</p>
<p>“Already been asked. They’re meeting right now.”</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you there?”</p>
<p>“My caseload is already to… daunting. I’ll join them later, when I’ve cleared some things off my plate.”</p>
<p>Jane smiled. “Excellent! If you and I succeed, where all others fail, we’re heroes and one giant step closer to where we want to get.”</p>
<p>“Remind me, boss.”</p>
<p>“Listen, chief, I<em> am</em> gonna be mayor of this town, and you’re gonna be my Chief of Police. You serious about this hunch of yours?</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>“Okay, play it and see where it goes. But keep it between us, for now. No one is going to kill all the lawyers on my watch, chief. But don’t limit yourself to the smartist. You are not Inspector Javert, he is not Jean Valjean. And I wanna know what I don’t know when next we parlez, oui?”</p>

I've written a screenplay, titled KILL ALL THE LAWYERS, in which a lot of lawyers get killed! WHA HAHAHAHA!
It's a dark, dazzling dramedy.
In my dreams, I see Johnny Depp and Lady Gaga in the lead roles, with Terry Gilliam directing.
The story starts with 365 lawyers being incinerated. After that, three more lawyers are killed, but not burned to death, by the arsonist.
Those dead lawyers can bear the names of the lawyers you hate. Any sleazy miscreant lawyer - perhaps an ex husband or wife? - who managed to screw you over can be killed off in my soon-to-be cinema classic
Or, YOU can kill as many lawyers as you want! There's a scene in the story where a person goes nuts and slaughters a whole office full of lawyers. That person can be YOU! Those lawyers can be your lawyers.
Minimum price - $1000 per lawyer, or $2000 to be the killer and name the lawyers you want to kill.
I'll email you the script, so you can see how and why your lawyer will be killed. Murders can be customized, although I'm sure you'll all want the slow, extremely painful and preferably humiliating fashion.
I'm trying to raise money to cover my living expenses while I transform the screenplay into a novel and simultaneously shop the script.
Obviously, I can't guarantee that the screen version will ever be produced but a book will be completed and sold as an ebook for $1. You can have as many ebooks as you desire.
Book will be available no later than December 23, 2013, just in time for Christmas. 
HUBBA HUBBA, boys and girls, let's slaughter those stinking swine already!
This is how the screenplay opens:
Scene 1           Disclaimer      
A lawyer walks into the camera’s view. He has some papers in his hands. He clears his throat and starts speaking
LAWYER
Before we can allow you watch this film we must take a number of legal precautions.
This is a work of fiction. It is a potentially dangerous piece of art. It is, in no way, meant to incite you, the viewer, to kill, or in any way harm, one or more lawyers.
By purchasing a ticket to watch this movie you have entered  into an implicit contract that indemnifies everyone who had a role in the production and/or distribution and/or promotion of the film against any legal action that may result from damages, physical or financial, that you, the viewer, may visit upon one or more lawyers, at any time in the future, at any location on this or any other planet.
Should you, the viewer, while watching the film, or at any time thereafter, feel a strong urge to run amok, slaughtering lawyers, you are strongly advised to seek professional help from a qualified mental health professional.
The preceding sentence is in no way to be construed as a libelous, actionable questioning of your present, past or future sanity.
Now, if you would be so kind as to raise your right hands, and repeat after me…
The lawyer fumbles his papers and drops them to the floor. The papers are all connected, like the old dot matrix printers used to use. The pile of papers is very long
LAWYER      
…we can get on with the show. Should you have any questions about the following contractual pledge, we advise you to leave the theater immediately and consult a lawyer
Shakespeare, comes out and shoots the lawyer in the face before saying
SHAKESPEARE
Fuckin’ lawyers. Alright, on with the show!
Scene 2           Young Pablo gets an idea
Young Pablo is in a juvenile detention facility, behind bars. He’s reading Henry VI and laughing. Camera comes in tight on the line, “First thing we do is KILL ALL THE LAWYERS.” Pablo laughs maniacally
Scene 3           Opening credits 
Opening credits roll over the screen as a gang of lawyers rape Lady Justice
****
so, while i'm trying to figure out how to drive raffic to this campaign, and raise money, i'm going to proceed with the transformation and post my efforts here
Surely someone, somewhere has, at some point, attempted something similar to what I’m about to try, but here it goes, anyway. I’m going to “talk to you” in the story. And I’m going explain to you what I’ve done, and why I did it, after each chapter.
CHAPTER 1
Some FBI schmuck was staring at an NSA babe and thinking of a sexually deviant congressman he’d arrested six years earlier. The NSA babe was talking to another FBI schmuck, who was probably thinking of sexual deviance that had nothing to do with a congressman. “So, why did the Muslim terrorists burn 350 lawyers to death,” the girl asked the other FBI schmuck.
The congressman was yet another one of those upstanding middle class Americans who campaigned, vociferously and perpetually, for ‘family values’ - whatever the fuck that means these days - while secretly pondering how much elasticity there was in the Ten Commandments and all those Sunday morning sermons he’d managed to sit through since his childhood. The FBI schmuck hadn’t been tipped off to the congressman’s perversions. The congressman was not under investigation when he got caught, literally, with his pants down at a high school football game. The congressman had simply lost his mind for a moment. He wasn’t even drunk. And he’d probably have gone on to a long career in politics, if not for the fact that the FBI schmuck saw him, out of the corner of his eye, as he was pulling his pud while staring out onto the field from a dark corner of the stadium on a Friday night.
The FBI schmuck didn’t even know the congressman was a congressman when he snuck up behind him and slapped the cuffs on him. The congressman had been pulling it hard for a couple minutes. He’d rounded third and was heading home when the FBI schmuck had grabbed him by the back of the neck (no, I am not guilty of mixing my metaphors because the football story is a true story and the baseball analogy is a metaphor, dumbass).
The congressman spilled his seed the second the FBI schmuck collared him. He was tugging with his right hand and splooged on his left hand. The FBI schmuck was unaware that the congressman’s left hand was covered in a prodigious amount of man chowder until their left hands made contact, as the cop reached around to pull the pervert’s hand behind his back. Once the cuffs were locked, the FBI schmuck examined his hand and HOLY FUCK was he disgusted. So disgusted that he kicked the cuffed congressman to the ground and started laying the boots to the pervert.
When the congressman pitifully cried out, “Stop! I am a United States congressman,” the cop was stunned. The copper ceased the assault and laughed. Then he found the pervert’s wallet. He pulled out the driver’s license and called his station. Sure as hell, the creep was a congressman.
When the congressman went to trial, he swore up and down on a stack of bibles that he was staring at the cheerleaders, a single specific cheerleader, in fact, not the football players, when he was, for a horrible moment, “caught in a trap laid by Satan himself.”
It was, in the judge’s mind, vitally important that he be absolutely sure on this point. For, if the congressman was, in fact, fantasizing about having his way with one of the football players, he was going to do some serious time.
 If, on the other hand, he had been bewitched by one of the ‘rah rah sis boom bah, I know you wanna fuck me, oolala!’ teasing, tarty teens, he would cut the poor fool some slack. ‘I’ll give him a couple years,’ thought the judge, staring at the congressman’s buxom cougar of a wife and thinking impure thoughts. ‘Perhaps wifey over there will show some gratitude.’
In order to believe the congressman’s charges of witchery, the judge ordered the girl in question to make an appearance in court. The girl, all of fifteen, could have been traumatized by the attention, but she was not that kind of girl. She lived for the attention and she got more than any other girl in town, by a country mile.  The second the FBI schmuck saw the girl in court he felt bad for the congressman. She was a dead-on strumpet. None of that girl next door bullshit. The fucking harlot showed up wearing a Hello Kitty tube top, a micro mini and a pair of thigh-high fuck-me-hard fuck-me-now boots. In court! The fuckin’ whore!
The congressman got two years, less a day, the judge got the congressman’s wife, the tart got the front page of the paper three days in a row, and the FBI schmuck got on with his life.
And now, six years later, here was that bewitching babe, all grown up and standing ten feet in front of him, sipping a coffee and shooting the shit with some other FBI schmuck. He was pretty sure it was her. It had to be her.
“So, why did the Muslim terrorists burn 350 lawyers to death,” the girl asked the other FBI schmuck. The other FBI schmuck smiled and shrugged.
“Because Allah fucking Akbar, baby!” roared the girl. The two of them exploded in laughter and high fived.
Just then, Phil Head walked into the room. Head looked at the clock. Seven a.m. on the dot. Right on time. “Okay, everyone, shut the fuck up.” Everyone shut the fuck up. “The Mayor brings greetings from the President.” Mayor Jose Cuervo walked into the room, five feet behind Head. 
The Mayor was a big, fat Mexican. Shut up. Don’t tell me I can’t say he was a big, fat Mexican, because he was a big, fat Mexican. A big, fat, jolly Mexican. Cuervo was a funny guy. Funny as in hahaha funny. He excelled at taking the piss out of himself (in case you don’t know, that’s how a Brit would say he had a habit of engaging in self-deprecating humour and was very good at it – if you don’t know what that means, Google it).
Cuervo weighed 270 pounds when he first became Mayor of New York City, two years earlier. Trailing his main opponent by as much as 27 points with a month left in the campaign, Cuervo gambled his whole political career on a joke. He convinced his friend, the head of the Bronx Zoo, to let him shoot a faux candid video with the elephants.
It was claimed that the video was shot by a pair of tourists from Japan. The couple just happened to stumble across Cuervo at the elephant enclosure, where, get this, the elephants were throwing peanuts to the fat Mexican. Cuervo was catching, shelling and eating the peanuts. And laughing! Jose Cuervo, a big, fat Mexican was laughing like a gas-huffing hippopotamus. It was a deep, booming, baritone, infectious laugh. His laughter set the Japs (oh, fuck you, I can so  say Japs) giggling in a high pitch. Combined, the trio’s laughter proved to be more infectious than SARS
The female of Nipponese oriental persuasion (there, you happy?) asked Cuervo, “What you do?”
To which Cuervo replied, “What it look I do? I eating peanuts.” The Japs (yeah, yeah, fuck you, go back to reading Mother Jones, ‘cause you ain’t gonna dig the rest of this yearn) giggled and giggled. Cuervo snorted laughter and said, “I’m so fat that when I go to the zoo, the elephants feed me peanuts.”
The video went viral over night. Cuervo claimed that he had been so distraught about his political plight that he went to see, “the only fuckers in New York that are fatter than me,” to ask their advice. And when he started asking questions, the elephants felt his sadness and decided to cheer him up by feeding him their peanuts. It was, he said, a transcendental experience.
Even the New York Times, the New York fuckin; Times, my friends – a paper so stiff that it had never even printed the word fun in its august pages in its entire history – was so thoroughly charmed that it loosened up and dubbed him Elephant Man. The Post trumped that by declaring him Mayor Elephant Man.
Cuervo rode earthquakes of laughter and waves of awwww! all the way to the Mayor’s office.
Saying that it was important for him to be seen in the city’s eateries, Cuervo had put on another 50 pounds by the time he waddled into the room. He was a dead ringer for Ralph Steadman’s drawings of Hunter S Thompson’s 300 pound Samoan lawyer in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Yeah, the big, fat  Mexican looked like a Samoan cartoon. Don’t all big, fat Mexicans look the same as big, fat Samoans? Well, they do to me.
The Mayor understood the gravity of the situation – more than 350 lawyers had been incinerated when some kind of evil genius arsonist had torched the New York State Bar Association Annual General Meeting the day before. This was supposed to be a dour, dead serious briefing. Gathered before him were the best available agents of the FBI, CIA, NSA, and NYPD.
Cuervo started well, “I’ve just returned from meeting the President at the Whitehouse. She has asked me to head up this joint task force.”
That meeting had not gone well. Although he had backed her bid for the Presidency, Cuervo did not like the Nation’s first female President. She was, to put it mildly, a humourless cunt. Cuervo once quipped, in an off-the-record drinking session with a couple journalists, that she was so wound up that she could crack walnuts with her sphincter.
The President had summoned the Mayor to the Whitehouse the minute she heard about the inferno. A lawyer herself, she wanted to ride the point on this one. The Mayor wanted to wear the white hat. He knew that some of her good friends had been roasted, and that made her the wrong person to round up a posse and start hunting. “Dirty Harry with tits,’ he thought to himself when he saw her.
In the end, Mayor Cuervo convinced the President to let him run this circus.
But no matter how he tried, the Mayor just couldn’t feel the pain. Like most everyone else, Cuervo hated lawyers. He even hated his mother, a lawyer, and you know how Mexicans are about their mothers… or, is that Italians. Well, you know, Italians, Mexicans, Samoans, what’s the difference?
So, as he stood before his task force, he couldn’t resist the temptation to crack wise.
“She’s asked me to congratulate those of you who lost your lawyers in the liar’s pyre, yesterday, and say better luck next time to those of you who did not.”
The room exploded with laughter. Cuervo knew how to play a room, although he need not have been The Amazing Kreskin to figure out that his audience didn’t have much liking for lawyers, either.
“Okay,” said Cuervo, “that’s the last dead lawyer joke I want to hear,” but, again, he couldn’t      resist, “… unless you’ve got a really good one.”
The NSA babe didn’t hesitate for a second, “Why did the Muslim terrorists burn 350 lawyers to death?’ Cuervo knew he was gonna love the punchline. He already wished it were his joke. He smiled, shrugged and waited.
The FBI schmuck, who had busted the pervy congressman, had always been a shameless suck-up to authority figures. He saw an opportunity to curry favour with the Mayor and pounced before the NSA babe could spit out the punchline, “Because Allah fucking Akbar, baby!”
It worked. The Mayor howled with laughter, a s did the rest of the room. Only the NSA babe remained silent. She was pissed. The FBI schmuck instantly understood that he was not going to get so much as a whiff of the babe’s fuck-me-hard fuck-me-now boots. But he didn’t care because the Mayor, Mayor Jose Cuervo, had laughed at his joke.
“Okay, everyone settle down,” said the Mayor. “Seriously. That’s it for the dead lawyer jokes. The official death toll now stands at 358. Going up in flames is a horrible way to die… even for lawyers.
“It falls to you to find out who is responsible and to bring them to justice.
“Phil Head, here, will be overseeing the investigation and reporting directly to myself and the President.
“I’ll leave you all to get better acquainted and get to work.”
****
And that’s the last you’ll see of the FBI schmucks and the NSA babe. They are so unimportant to this story that they didn’t even get names. The vast majority of this chapter was a pointless exercise in page filling. The “because Allah fucking Akbar, baby,” joke came to me and I had to create something to put it in.
 

I need to establish the farcical side of this story right from the start because, if some nut case actually goes out and starts killing lawyers, after reading this, or watching the movie, I’m not gonna do time for it.
 

Back in 94, in Vancouver, I wrote a piece in Terminal City titled Booze Up and Riot. In the piece I encouraged readers to booze up and riot on the night the Canucks should have won the Stanley Cup. The Canucks lost, but the riot erupted anyway.
 

The cops investigated me and the mag and contemplated laying charges against myself and the editor. Eventually, the cops decided not to attempt a prosecution against us. The police report stated:
""SALMI is known to the author as a person with extreme views, a high intellect but a non-violent and a bark worse than his bite… Very few intelligent readers take SALMI seriously. However, he writes with great conviction and in the language of the street to the extent that persons of street-level intellect might take him seriously.”
The report continues, ""SALMI wrote this article with a tongue-in-cheek attitude perhaps with no intent to actually incite the riot. He may not have realized what the consequences of his actions might have been.""
Most importantly, it concludes, ""given the ridiculous nature of the entire article,"" it would be next to impossible to take it seriously enough to recommend charges be brought.

In the screenplay version of this story, I immediately establish the all-important “ridiculous nature” of the entire work in the first scene, when Shakespeare comes out and shoots the lawyer
 

That scene doesn’t work in a book, so I need to open with something that immediately establishes the all-important “ridiculous nature” of it all, and that’s why I’m leading with the “Allah Fucking Akbar, baby!” joke and a big, fat Mexican mayor of NYC, named Jose Cuervo, cracking wise after a terrorist attack
 
 

No matter how serious this story gets, and all good socio-political satire must have a serious side to it, this is a joke, so fuck off if you think you’re going to make any criminal charges stick against me
 

Most books are full of filler. I generally disdain filler but I’m playing around with the concept, hoping that I can at least make my filler somewhat entertaining, unlike the miles of meandering, meaningless mumbo-jumbo that many meandering, meaningless writers spew forth.
 

You will see Mayor Jose Cuervo again, but not for a while. And you’re not going to like him nearly as much as you do now.
 

Flip the page and you get to meet the female star of this story, Jane Baker. Jane looks exactly like Lady Gaga. Jane gets fucked in the next chapter, Jane gets fucked a fair bit I this book. Do you think she gets fucked in the ass? Do you want her to get fucked in the ass?
 

If Lady Gaga doesn’t work for you, picture Jane as someone else. Gwen Stefani, maybe? Oh, fuck, what the fuck do I care? Make her look like you for all I give a fuck.

 CHAPTER 2
Jane was all of 12 years old when her mother muttered 15 words that stuck with her for the rest of her life. It was mom’s turn to host Martini Monday, the monthly meeting of The Coven of Bitter, Childless Post-menopausal Witches, of which she was an honourary member, and the old crones were in fine form. Jane’s mother was holding court, telling the ladies of her latest conquest, while Jane was serving canapés. “A good man is hard to find,” mom mumbled after quaffing a multitude of martinis, “but a hard man is good to find!” The coven cackled cacophonously and mom pointed a crooked finger at Jane and said, “Always remember that, Jane.”
Jane always remembered that.
Once again, her mother’s words echoed in Jane’s mind as she awoke on the morning after the Liar’s Pyre to discover that her still slumbering husband was endowed with glorious morning wood. As Jane espied hubby’s prodigious pole, a small whimper of excitement escaped her. “A hard man is good to find!” Jane thought, as she slid down the bed to behold the engorged serpent.
Jane flicked her tongue lightly across the serpent head. Hubby squirmed, just a bit, still not waking, as the snake first twitched, then throbbed. Delighted, Jane licked her lips and went to work.
Over the 14 years that had passed since the moment Jane’s mother had mumbled the magical words that changed the girl’s life forever, Jane had sucked a mile of cock. Six inches, four inches, eight inches, ten inches, tree-trunk fat, drumstick thin, helmet-heads and anteaters, Jane loved them all, despite what she thought of the guys attached to them.
In the process of her hands-on and mouth-open education, Jane had long ago tamed the troublesome gag reflex, so she had no trouble swallowing the throbbing serpent whole. Hubby snapped into a state of consciousness instantly. The only thing he could see was the top of Jane’s head. He was not displeased with the view.
Jane held him in her throat, breathing through her nose. He bucked instinctively, but she pinned his hips to the bed with her forearms and held him still for ten seconds before disgorging his manhood. Jane stared her prey straight in the eye and emitted a low, throaty growl before swallowing the serpent one more time.
Hubby grabbed her by the hair and fucked her face ferociously. Jane thrashed like a wild animal caught in a trap. Her body was out of control, arms flailing, legs spasming. Locked into a primal sexual frenzy, Jane’s mind was devoid of thought. She broke free from his hold, just as he was about to erupt, and hissed, “Fuck me!”
In less than a second his hands were back in her hair. He pulled her head with both his hands and slammed her on her back. Jane rose up on her shoulder blades, hips thrashing in the air, screaming, “Fuck me! Fuck me!”
Hubby thrust his nine inches into Jane’s quivering tunnel and fucked her like a Klingon. He pulled her hair, slapped her face and spat on her, “Take it, you fucking whore.”
“Fuck me!” Jane panted. “Fuck me harder, you fucking caveman. FUCK ME!”
And, just like that, it was over. Hubby shuddered for a moment, fell silent for another moment, and then, in the throes of post orgasmic revulsion, scowled “Look at you! You disgust me, you fucking pig.”
He rolled off of her and began to dress, hastily.
“Hey!” Jane protested.
“I’m a busy man, Jane. I don’t have time to wait around for your orgasm. I have to take a deposition in half an hour.
Jane fumed, silently, unfulfilled, as her husband departed.
****

I have no idea if that works or not. It is the first time I've made any effort to write a sex scene. I don't feel cheap and/or dirty! There's a lot more sex to come in this tale, so I'll have to work on it.
But there, my friends, is your female star. In the scriptm, this comes before the first meeting of the task force, which is, for the moment at least, CHAPTER 1 of the book
While I was writing the screenplay, I attempted to watch AND JUSTICE FOR ALL,  a 1979 flick starring Al Pacino. Pacino was nominated for the best actor Oscar, and the film was also short-listed for BEST ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY. I liked it when it forst came out but I could not get throughthe first half hour when I tried to watch it again. Talk about PLODDING!

There's just no way I was going to ""come out of th gates"" as slowly as Jewison did in his film. The only thing I learned in journalism school that's been of any value to me over the years is the necessity of a great lead. Hook 'em or lose 'em.
So, sex and comedy in the first five minutes

I want to clearly establish jane as a highly sexual creature right from the start. If not consciously, I want people to be craving more sex subconsciously and by throwing this scene in at the begining I want them thinkng that I have promised them more sex

I also want to make it clear that Jane is married to a lawyer and it is not going as well as she might like.
CHAPTER 3
Twenty-six year old Jane Baker, blond, beautiful, bright and extremely ambitious, sipped a coffee as she walked into the office of Pius Akecheta, a captain in NYPD’s homicide department. She threw her copy of the first edition of the New York Post on Akecheta’s desk and asked, “What the fuck do you make of this, chief?”
Akecheta, a Mohawk Indian from upstate New York, looked at the 120 point headline on the front page – LAWYERS BURN IN ‘HELL’ - and answered, “I’d say the Post’s headline writers have outdone themselves this time.”
Jane agreed, “Yeah, it’s a beauty. Al Queda?”
“If it was, they just went from zeroes to heroes in the eyes of a lot of Americans. They keep this up and they will quickly become exactly what this country needs.”
“What’s that, chief?”
“A  legitimate third party.”
Jane chuckled. “You know the problem with Islam?”
Akecheta, an often-conflicted yet still marginally devout Catholic, scribbled NUKE MECCA on a scratch pad, chuckled and said, “No, but I know what the solution is.”
“Yeah?”
Akecheta put his pen down, looked up at Jane and said, “Never mind. What‘s the problem with Islam?”
“The Muslim world never underwent an Age of Enlightenment. Science and reason never beat fanaticism into the dark shadows of disrepute. Had that happened, Muslim fanatics would be far less dangerous. They'd be on a par with our Christian lunatics.”
“I don’t know, boss. Your people kept slaughtering an entire continent while you were getting enlightened, and you’ve kept right on subjugating and slaughtering indigenous peoples all around the world ever since.”
Jane, an agnostic, looked at the cross dangling from Akecheta’s neck, thought about bringing up The Crusades, but decided to give it a pass. “How’d they do it?” she said, pointing to the front page  photo of charred corpses being removed from the site of the Liar’s Pyre, “Whoever they are?”
“Divine guidance?”
“Your good Lord hates lawyers?”
“Why do you think he created Hell?”
“Well, leaving aside Al Queda, your good Lord, and an overzealous Shakespeare fan with his moon in Dante, what should we be looking for, here?”
“Dick.”
“I’m not looking for Dick”
The Mohawk gave Jane a once-over. Tight skirt, plunging neckline on her top, two-inch heels. “Your attire says different.”
“I don’t have time for this. I have to be in court in an hour.”
“Pablo Fiasco”
“The artist?”
“He prefers to be referred to as the smartist.”
“What about him?”
“Just a hunch. A wild guess. I know something you don’t. What do you know about him?”
“Not much. Enfant terrible of the art world. Pretty boy”
Akecheta pulled up Fiasco’s Wikipedia page on his computer. “Le grande enfant terrible. He created a video game called Kill God.” Akecheta noticed Jane’s smile but let it go. “The game starts with the Archangel Michael making an appearance in Hell to have a talk with his lost brother, Satan. Michael informs Satan that God has lost his nut. He is going to smite all Earthly disbelievers and create a thousand year Reich, during which anyone who so much as looks at him sideways gets burned to ashes.”
“Burned to ashes?” Jane said. “Really? Just like all those lawyers.”
“Correct. Just like all those lawyers. Anyway, Satan shakes his head in disbelief and summons Jesus, who, apparently, is a guest in Hell. Satan explains the situation and commands Jesus to go forth and Kill God. “
“Well, every boy wants to kill his father, at some point.”
Akecheta searched his mind and remembered that he did, indeed, want to kill his father, on a number of occasions. He pushed those memories aside and continued. “Jesus starts the battle at his birth and moves forward through time. Along the way he must smite those who have killed, or harmed, in his name, in order to get to the next level – the crusaders, the mobs at the Salem Witch Trials, pedophile priests. In his last battle before he gets to Heaven, to go mano a mano with his old man, Jesus must slaughter the Pope. Mercilessly. With extreme malice.”
“Let me guess; that heresy was a winner?”
“He’s still making a fortune from that one. At any given time you’ll find a million or so reprobates playing live, online, at killgod dot com.” Jane, who came from an entrepreneurial family, resisted the temptation to praise Pablo’s ambition and success, and Akecheta continued.
“He fronted an avant-garde, underground, surf-metal band called Something Wicked this way Comes. “
“Ray Bradbury,” said Jane, strutting her literary knowledge.
The cop was impressed, but not surprised. He had nothing but respect for Jane’s brains. The two of them had formed a mutual admiration society since they’d crossed paths, a year earlier. They’d gotten into the habit of impressing each other with their knowledge of literature. The Indian quickly quipped, “Bradbury got it from Shakespeare. Macbeth. Act four, scene one. ‘By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes.’”
Jane knew the line, and was disappointed that she’d never realized that Bradbury had stolen the name of his classic from The Bard. But the girl was not to be outdone by the cop. “And Bradbury got pissed at Michael Moore for Farenheit 911? That’s funny.”
Jane was well aware of Akecheta’s deep respect for Moore, so before he could start on yet another  fawning of the man’s works she checked her watch and twirled her index finger. Akecheta took the queue.
“Like Henry Rollins before him, he got bored with rock ‘n’ roll and gave it up for something more edgy. Something with a little more intellectual gravitas, I believe, is the way he put it. He became Homopope.”
“Homopope?” Jane said, stealing a look at a pic of Pablo on the computer screen.”He’s gay?”
“No. He’s a fuck-shit-upper. Just loves to fuck shit up. Gay? I don’t think so.”
“Good.”
“What?”
“Nothing.”
Akecheta raised an eyebrow but resisted the temptation to pull the thread. “Or… who knows? Maybe he is. But he pandered to the gay community. He went after the Catholic Church in a very disrespectful manner.
“He would set up shop outside Catholic churches, on Sunday mornings, wearing a Papal mitre and bondage gear.”
Jane could not resist smiling. The often-conflicted Catholic ignored her grin, and continued, “He would taunt parishioners by quoting Jesus –‘ If anyone says, I love God, but hates the brothers or sisters, he is a liar...Whoever loves God must also love the brothers and sisters.’
“Later in the day, he would hold court at gay brunches, where he would take confessions and offer absolutions for all the sinful acts of debauchery that were committed the night before. He recorded all those filthy, lurid confessions and made them available to homopope.com subscribers. Made a fortune.”
Akecheta continued. “When Benny the 16th got called to the great gig in the sky, Homopope raised a queer army and marched on the Vatican.”
Jane said, “Yes. I remember that. Blood in the streets.”
“Close,” said Akecheta. “Ten thousand screaming fags parked themselves in St. Peter’s Square, and prayed for pink smoke. They chanted, ‘Pink smoke! Homopope! Pink smoke! Homopope!’
“Italian soccer hooligans didn’t care for that much. Nor did the mafia. Offended their mothers. The Italian army had to be called in to prevent a massacre. The Cardinals were forced to appeal for calm to prevent bloodshed. They also had to pick a new Pope double plus quick to put an end to what was, for the Catholic Church, a nightmarish circus.”
Jane had a lightbulb moment, “That stunt may have had a big effect. Maybe Pope Franky was thinking of Homopope whe he started to ask who is he to judge gays.”
When Akecheta said nothing, it occurred to Jane that he might be enough of a mindless follower to relinquish his right to freedom of thought, and surrender to the dictates of the Vatican. She was a bit disappointed.
Akecheta’s mind twitched in confusion.  He did not hate gays, despite the fact that he had been taught to. But it was clear that the Church had no use for them. The Vatican had not softened its hardline against homosexuality, when other Christian churches had. Then, along came the new Latino Pope signaling a major change in direction. And here was this… this girl, suggesting that Homopope may have influenced the Vatican’s thinking. The conflicted Catholic could neither add nor subtract, multiply nor divide. He could not do the math. He was well and truly tharned.
Akecheta snapped out his state of mental paralysis but was still unable to mount a comeback, and he was visibly annoyed.
Jane mistakenly assumed her friend was pissed at her. She’d had enough man shit for one day, thank you very much, and lacked the patience to deal with any more, so she delivered what she hoped would be a coup de grace, “You Catholics should concern yourselves far less with what transpires in the bedrooms of consenting adults, and far more with your pedophile priests.”
Akecheta had heard it before, of course, and he was ready with a response, “Did you ever stop to think that maybe Satan is behind all that business?
“Satan?”
“If you were Satan, or even Satanic, would you not attempt to tempt the Lord’s messengers, in order to discredit the Lord?”
Jane rolled her eyes. “So, every child raping priest can get himself exonerated by saying the devil made him do it?”
“We will all be judged in a higher court.”
Jane shook her head. Her friend Pius was getting a little too Pious for the good of the discussion. “Okay, Fiasco’s a social deviant and a heretic. So what?” Jane twirled her finger.
“He’ll burn in Hell. He’s a vile degenerate, a filthy blasphemer,” said Pius, before conceding, “But a fuckin’ eh smart one.”
Jane twirled her index finger again. “Yes. The smartist. What else?”
­­­­ “He started the whole mail order groom business, with groom with a broom dot com. He saw that women, in this advanced age of sexual liberation, were ready to start treating men, or boys, the same way they have been treated for eons. He understood that the ladies wanted a man who could cook, clean and fuck their lights out.”
Jane had heard of Groom with a Broom.  She laughed, “And every cougar with a six figure salary, and/or bank balance, divorced her fat, old, impotent husband and bought herself a third-world groom with a broom?”
“All of whom have donkey dicks, no doubt!” Akecheta added.
“Nice! What’s he doing these days?”
“The world is waiting to see his next lurid collection of vile paintings.”
The feline’s finger twirled in the air.
“For the past decade and a half, he’s been painting scenes of Popes getting together to… ummm… sexually blaspheme Jesus.”
Jane was fully aware that the big Mohawk had legally changed his name to Pius Akecheta. Akecheta was the Mohawk name for Fighter. There had been 12 Popes named Pius. She understood that any person who had changed his name to embrace a dozen Popes would be sensitive about his namesakes. She proceeded with caution.
“Bukkake Baby Jesus. I’ve heard about this,” she said, matter of factly. 
The Catholic noted her change of tone. He mentally acknowledged that she was backing off, and carried on. “Yeah. Even Damien Hirst was shocked and appalled.”
Jane did not show any indication that she knew the name Damien Hirst. Akecheta smugly chalked up a point for himself. “He puts a handful of Popes together in one painting. They’ve arrived at the nativity scene in a time machine. All of them are splooging on baby Jesus.”
Jane laughed out loud. The cop looked back at his computer screen, pretending he had not heard her, and carried on. “He hopes to get all 265 Popes into the paintings before he dies. His justification for this filth is that, according to him, the policies and practices of the Catholic Church are defiling the message and spirit of Christ.
“Well, he has an argument.”
“What the fuck would you know about it?”
“Settle down, chief. At least he’s ambitious.”
“Hell is filled with ambitious souls.”
Jane mentally acknowledged his contempt and bowed down to it. “Amen, brother. When is his next BBJ show scheduled?”
“No one knows. Probably not even him. I think he’s been sidetracked with his latest project.”
“Which is?”
“Jawjaw.”
“The… talking thing?”
The cop lost a point or two of respect for Jane. He not so subtly mocked her, “ Right. The… talking thing. He realized that people who are practically living online really do want to meet, and have interesting conversations with, real live people. He’s giving them the opportunity.
“And they are availing themselves of the opportunity?”
“More than two hundred franchises opened up across the country in the first nine months, and he’s about to take the concept global.
Jane  looked at her watch, twirled her finger. She was about to say something when her phone rang. “Okay, on my way.” She turned to Akecheta and said, “You still haven’t told me anything.”
“I don’t have anything. It’s just a hunch. And I don’t always tell you everything.”
“Why do you know so much about him?”
The cop looked at her and pondered whether or not he should answer the question, before doing so, “I’m on a mission.”
Jane opened her eyes wide. “From God?”
“I’m buying a stairway to heaven.”
Jane rolled her eyes. “You’ll be asked to be on the investigating task force. Pass on it. Tell them your caseload is already too daunting. But tell them that you can join later, when you’ve cleared some things off your plate. That way, they’ll keep you in the loop.”
“Already been asked. They’re meeting right now.”
“Why aren’t you there?”
“My caseload is already to… daunting. I’ll join them later, when I’ve cleared some things off my plate.”
Jane smiled. “Excellent! If you and I succeed, where all others fail, we’re heroes and one giant step closer to where we want to get.”
“Remind me, boss.”
“Listen, chief, I am gonna be mayor of this town, and you’re gonna be my Chief of Police. You serious about this hunch of yours?
“I am.”
“Okay, play it and see where it goes. But keep it between us, for now. No one is going to kill all the lawyers on my watch, chief. But don’t limit yourself to the smartist. You are not Inspector Javert, he is not Jean Valjean. And I wanna know what I don’t know when next we parlez, oui?”

in the process of transforming my screenplay into a book, i've churned out 3000 words to cover the first two very short scenes. there are more than 50 scenes in the script. i fear this will turn into a meandering monster. if i can become as bored with my ramblings as others are bored by them, i may be able to keep this down to half the length of war and peace
pablo fiasco was the name of a graffiti artist, in vancouver, in the 80s. i love the name and it is perfect for the star of this yarn. an explanation of how my star chose the name is forthcoming
clearly, pablo is a fuck-shit-upper. and he’s very good at fucking shit up. the world needs more fuck-shit-uppers, and I am trying to create an iconic one to inspire others
pablo has made a fortune, several fortunes, actually, from fucking shit up. i believe that several fortunes can be made by fucking shit up.
i have, unsuccessfully, attempted to float homopope, jawjaw, something wicked this way comes, and killgod as business ventures. this may be my last attempt to make money from the concepts. others, with more business savvy than i, may well pick up on the ideas and run with them, if this work of mine ever gets popular",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

Conference with Mizna– three days of performances, readings, workshops, panels, a 
film screening, a mixer, and a culminating celebration which will 
include the Arab American Book Awards ceremony.  The conference will 
take place at Open Book in Minneapolis, MN,  9/18-20.
The conference is open to the public and will feature writers, artists, translators, editors, performers, and educators. This gathering will include a series of panels, workshops, and seminars on 
the topic of writing and Arab American literature, readings and 
performances, as well as several networking opportunities. As
 part of our goal to foster and support new voices within Arab 
American literature, we will be highlighting workshops and panels 
designed specifically for emerging writers.    Who We Are  RAWI is a non-profit 501(c)(3) literary organization dedicated to 
supporting and disseminating creative writing and scholarly writing by 
Arab-Americans.
This time around, we are working with Mizna, an organization devoted to promoting Arab-American culture,
 providing a forum for its expression. What We Need The Radius of Arab American Writers - RAWI - aims to raise 
$5,000. These funds will be used to help support guest speakers, student
 scholarships, and readings at the conference and beyond. We are a 501 (c) (3) organization, so your donation is tax-deductible.   Why Is This An Important Event?
 RAWI is the only national organization that provides mentoring, community, and support for Arab American writers.

Despite the fact that
 Arab American voices continue to become more prominent, opportunities 
for us to share our experiences and insights, as well as to discuss the 
trajectory of Arab American
 literature, is limited.  Therefore, RAWI’s biennial conference provides a
 rare opportunity to bring a large number of Arab American writers and 
scholars (and their readers and admirers) into the same space so we can 
engage in various dialogues otherwise unavailable to us.

The conference also 
provides us the opportunity to continue our rapid growth and act as representatives of the literary arts in Arab America. Who Are RAWI's Members?Members of RAWI include Naomi Shihab Nye, Lawrence Joseph, Suheir Hammad,
 Laila Lalami, Randa Jarrar, Khaled Mattawa, Mohja Kahf, Fady Joudah, 
Etel Adnan, Steven Salaita,  Sam Hazo, Rabih Alameddine, Elmaz Abinader,
 and many more. RAWI’s work has been 
featured on the US Department of State website and has been covered by 
the New York Times, Aramco World, and The Washington Report on Middle 
East Affairs. Its members
 have been featured in The Huffington Post, NPR, Guernica, PMLA (the 
journal of the Modern Language Association), and elsewhere. 
Our members have also been recognized by the Academy of American Poets, 
the US State Department’s Arabic Book Program, and the National 
Endowment for the Arts, as well as many state and regional
 arts associations and councils.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help: Please get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.  Thank you for supporting Arab-American voices!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>The project began with a portrait of a friend. Exhibiting this first Petal Portrait in a Chelsea gallery, people immediately responded to the provocative expression of femininity, inner power, fragility, strength and sensuality I was able to capture between woman &amp; petal. I decided to continue with a series, restaging that initial photo with different women and flowers.<br/>I began photographing women around me that I found inspiring: friends, family, colleagues.  As the project grew, a mosaic emerged; an increasingly dynamic and diverse group of women brought their individually unique presence to each sitting creating a rich and complex dialog.  <br/><b>The Petal Project </b>has been chosen to be in the Saatchi online Curated Collection, and featured in Creem magazine. I want to make this record into a printed photo book.</p>

<b>About The Photographer: </b> <p>My name is Tal, I am a fine art portrait and fashion photographer. My work in photography and image-making has been published and exhibited nationally and internationally, and featured in HBO, MTV, TOPMAN Generation Magazine, Rolling Stone, Italian Vogue, Creem, Kid- In &amp; W Magazine. <br/><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get;</b> </p>
<p>My goal is to print a First edition photo book, limited printing of 500 copies. To do this, I need to raise $8,500 to cover printing and shipping costs. The Petal Project will be printed  with an international fine art publisher, ensuring the highest quality edit and color printing.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b>: </p>
<p>Each Petal Portrait has been an empowering and collaborative experience. Since 2010, this project has grown taken hold and become very dear to my heart. It is also a tribute to all the amazing women who gave of themselves to participate in it and been the inspiration for it. <br/>I am now asking you to be an expanded part of it: with your support, I can realize this publication-based art-object and further the reach of this shared adventure in book format.</p>

 enhances and challenges the traditional relationship, symbolism and 
depiction of flowers associated with female subjects. <br/></p><p>Inspired
 by the Dadaist movement and the works of Anna Therese Johanne Höch – 
critic of the mass culture beauty industry and pioneer of the art form 
known as photomontage - Tal Shpantzer blends fashion conceptualization, 
fine art painting stylistics and documentary photography techniques to 
construct a fictional scenario in which the pain and pleasure of 
personal experiences emerge with eerie and foreboding qualities. The 
natural levity and softness of each petal contrast with the explicitness
 and strength of its symbolism.<br/>“I am captivated by the 
dialogues that emerge through each woman and petal portrait. A raw and 
unpretentious moment can reveal complexities, evoke imagined histories, 
and hidden truths,” she says. The series is rooted in 
Ms. Shpantzer’s own experience with the reconfiguration of personal memory after a yearlong period of amnesia.</p><p><br/></p><p>Written by Tracy Ann Essoglou, PhD. SituationDesign, Inc. &amp; OffSiteLab :<br/><br/></p><p>The
 Petal Project by Tal Shpantzer is an exploration in female portraiture.
 Photographing women is fraught. Taking pictures of women immediately 
ventures success or failure in terms of the ability to retrieve the 
image of woman – any image of the woman, any woman, every woman, women… –
 from the coded manipulations of what stands for beauty and belonging, 
against the creation of singularity and individuation. In Shpantzer’s 
Petal Project, each woman is marked by the presence of a flower’s petal,
 bud or blossom covering the woman’s mouth. This element provides the 
visual echo uniting the series without dictating any single question or 
prerogative. </p><p><br/>Some of the portraits present an easy fit: as if
 the petal were a favorite flavor, a selected rouging or beguiling 
accessory. Other images poise on the edge of inescapable historicism: 
where the mouths of women are never neutral, single or simple, where 
covering invokes silencing or censorship, and the beauty of the 
flower-addition courses the continuum: conscious departure, frustrated 
coding, uneasy glorification, contentious complicity. In other words, 
not all of the images succeed, or succeed equally, at distancing us as 
viewers from seeing what we have mostly likely and most often ‘seen’ 
before – the staged and un-innocent serializing of women and the 
sexualizing of anything that involves us.<br/>Fortunately and 
strategically, the variation of faces, features, styles, angles and 
personal elements keeps the series grounded in exploration and vibrancy.
 Different postures individuate – even as the flowered mouth of each 
portrait builds the theme of the project. The women of these images are 
not reduced to one version, style or statement. Beauty emerges in the 
variations of the more subtle, observable elements: eyes, bones, brows 
bangs, freckles…It also appears in the stark willfulness of those 
‘sitting.’ There are no wall flowers in this project, no shrinking 
violets, or ambivalent participants. The series plays the tension: 
female, floral, futurity… before capturing the irreducible certitude of 
women choosing to… and ultimately, the beauty of the gaze not just 
returned, but active and attuned, self-aware and integrated.<br/><br/></p><p>The Petal series will be turned into a book and exhibition.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/566527/files/20140508112554-Pillow.jpg?1399573554"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><span class=""notranlsate""><p></p>

I decided to continue with a series, restaging that initial photo with different women and flowers.I began photographing women around me that I found inspiring: friends, family, colleagues.  As the project grew, a mosaic emerged; an increasingly dynamic and diverse group of women brought their individually unique presence to each sitting creating a rich and complex dialog.  The Petal Project has been chosen to be in the Saatchi online Curated Collection, and featured in Creem magazine. I want to make this record into a printed photo book.

About The Photographer:  My name is Tal, I am a fine art portrait and fashion photographer. My work in photography and image-making has been published and exhibited nationally and internationally, and featured in HBO, MTV, TOPMAN Generation Magazine, Rolling Stone, Italian Vogue, Creem, Kid- In & W Magazine. What We Need & What You Get; 
My goal is to print a First edition photo book, limited printing of 500 copies. To do this, I need to raise $8,500 to cover printing and shipping costs. The Petal Project will be printed  with an international fine art publisher, ensuring the highest quality edit and color printing.
The Impact: 
Each Petal Portrait has been an empowering and collaborative experience. Since 2010, this project has grown taken hold and become very dear to my heart. It is also a tribute to all the amazing women who gave of themselves to participate in it and been the inspiration for it. I am now asking you to be an expanded part of it: with your support, I can realize this publication-based art-object and further the reach of this shared adventure in book format.
The Perks: 
The Book!! Portrait & Petal Sessions, Large Photo C-Prints, Paul Richard Drip Painting, Petal Stationery Card Box Set, Lots & lots of personal Thank Yous across social media and in my book!!!
Other Ways You Can Help :

Petal Portraits:








Sample Overview:







Example of Artist Paul Richard Drip Painting available for custom order:talfoto@gmail.comAdditional Texts:Written by Marilena HatoupisIn The Petal Series, Tal Shpantzer both
 enhances and challenges the traditional relationship, symbolism and 
depiction of flowers associated with female subjects. Inspired
 by the Dadaist movement and the works of Anna Therese Johanne Höch – 
critic of the mass culture beauty industry and pioneer of the art form 
known as photomontage - Tal Shpantzer blends fashion conceptualization, 
fine art painting stylistics and documentary photography techniques to 
construct a fictional scenario in which the pain and pleasure of 
personal experiences emerge with eerie and foreboding qualities. The 
natural levity and softness of each petal contrast with the explicitness
 and strength of its symbolism.“I am captivated by the 
dialogues that emerge through each woman and petal portrait. A raw and 
unpretentious moment can reveal complexities, evoke imagined histories, 
and hidden truths,” she says. The series is rooted in 
Ms. Shpantzer’s own experience with the reconfiguration of personal memory after a yearlong period of amnesia.Written by Tracy Ann Essoglou, PhD. SituationDesign, Inc. & OffSiteLab :The
 Petal Project by Tal Shpantzer is an exploration in female portraiture.
 Photographing women is fraught. Taking pictures of women immediately 
ventures success or failure in terms of the ability to retrieve the 
image of woman – any image of the woman, any woman, every woman, women… –
 from the coded manipulations of what stands for beauty and belonging, 
against the creation of singularity and individuation. In Shpantzer’s 
Petal Project, each woman is marked by the presence of a flower’s petal,
 bud or blossom covering the woman’s mouth. This element provides the 
visual echo uniting the series without dictating any single question or 
prerogative. Some of the portraits present an easy fit: as if
 the petal were a favorite flavor, a selected rouging or beguiling 
accessory. Other images poise on the edge of inescapable historicism: 
where the mouths of women are never neutral, single or simple, where 
covering invokes silencing or censorship, and the beauty of the 
flower-addition courses the continuum: conscious departure, frustrated 
coding, uneasy glorification, contentious complicity. In other words, 
not all of the images succeed, or succeed equally, at distancing us as 
viewers from seeing what we have mostly likely and most often ‘seen’ 
before – the staged and un-innocent serializing of women and the 
sexualizing of anything that involves us.Fortunately and 
strategically, the variation of faces, features, styles, angles and 
personal elements keeps the series grounded in exploration and vibrancy.
 Different postures individuate – even as the flowered mouth of each 
portrait builds the theme of the project. The women of these images are 
not reduced to one version, style or statement. Beauty emerges in the 
variations of the more subtle, observable elements: eyes, bones, brows 
bangs, freckles…It also appears in the stark willfulness of those 
‘sitting.’ There are no wall flowers in this project, no shrinking 
violets, or ambivalent participants. The series plays the tension: 
female, floral, futurity… before capturing the irreducible certitude of 
women choosing to… and ultimately, the beauty of the gaze not just 
returned, but active and attuned, self-aware and integrated.The Petal series will be turned into a book and exhibition.

<p>Over the years, the weapons and tools of humanity evolve. Spears. Rifles. Cruise missiles. Drones. But some things stay the same. No matter how advanced the weapons, there is still a need for men to close face to face with their opponent, to engage him in a direct manner. Sometimes there are sentries that must be eliminated. Sometimes a soldier is attacked suddenly, and does not have the time to raise his rifle before he feels the enemy's breath on his face. Sometimes it the last minutes of the infantry advance, when men stand face to face with their foes. Sometimes it is simple personal defense.</p>

<p>This book had been developed by Red Army martial arts expert, N. N. Simkin, based on the combat experience of Soviet soldiers and sailors as well as NKVD special operatives. He wrote: “In those circumstances where the firearm is unavailable or malfunctioning, or when a soldier must operate in silence – then the knife becomes a powerful defensive and defensive weapon in the hands of a brave warrior, provided he possesses knife-fighting and martial arts skills.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>Based on his extensive knowledge of both real-world military experience and scientific work at the Soviet Union's institute of Physical Training, Simkin wrote this textbook, to be used both in training Red Army soldiers and students in Soviet schools, “allowing them to become true defenders of the Motherland from a young age.”</p>
<p>Where the first Soviet military manual published by DiLernia Publishing covered all aspects of what the military terms 'hand-to-hand combat', - including storming enemy positions, throwing hand-grenades and using the issue rifle at close range - this manual, titled ""Close Combat"" covers a far more specific and brutal topic.</p>

When my son asked me how the sperm got to the egg, I couldn't get to the library fast enough. The books I found about sex and reproduction were all wonderful; still I noticed how queer families and families formed via adoption, DI, and IVF were like footnotes in the larger story, which was about straight couples and straight sex. Where are the books for the rest of us, I wondered? So I went looking for all the sex ed books that didn't make it into the libraries or the standard recommended reading lists, and found even more great ones. What I didn't find was one for lesbian families with kids born via donor insemination that put their child's story at the center, so I decided to write one myself.</span></p><p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>As for me, I spent fifteen years explaining asthma, fixing boo boos, and helping patients through the most sensitive times of their lives. On the side I wrote for San Francisco Bay Area newspapers, and was a medical consultant for local social justice and human rights organizations.

<h3>The book and the Talents  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">(extract of the book introduction)</span>
</h3>
<p>These six stories are all wildly different, some of them poetic, others
more down-to-earth, but what they all have in common is the way in which these
men and women have uncovered something within themselves which empowered them
to help and create opportunities for others, often on a massive and until then
unthinkable scale. They all have used the arts, whether film, theatre,
photography, drama, dance or music, and allowed their gifts and talents to
reach out and infuse others, often young people and children, with values and
understanding that are vital for their future and the community.</p>
<p>As they tell their stories in their own words, it will become clear that
this book is neither another self-help book, nor a set of moral directives
about what anyone is supposed to think, believe or put into action. Far from
it. It is a book about passion and creativity, about friendship and kindness,
determination and, as we will see, focused and undistracted attention. It is a
book about compassion, because everyone in it has been driven by a compelling
desire to alleviate suffering, along with its causes. It is a book about
courage and resilience as well, as they all in their own ways had to overcome
obstacles and hardships, and sometimes the most gruelling and brutal of ordeals.
It is about transformation too. Some people like to make a distinction between
change and transformation. They say that change is an improvement or alteration
of what already exists, whilst transformation, like a butterfly freeing itself
from the chrysalis, means a new creation, where the only limits are our
imagination and commitment. </p>
<p>This is also a book of discovery, and as we read we might find it is full
of clues and insights and ideas, that might strike and move through our minds
like a rush of mountain air. But that is up to us, as we meet and make eye
contact with the women and men in these pages. They are human beings just like
us. And to be a human being is to be creative. We all have the capacity to
transform ourselves, change the world and inspire others.</p>
<p>None of these men and women set out to be catalysts for change in the world
or the source of hope and help for so many other people. It so happened that
each of them possessed a deep affinity with art and creativity, be it in the
form of music, dance, networking, photography or theater. All of them had
significant artistic talents. But what transpires as we follow them through the
formative years of their lives is that they each experienced a dramatic moment
of transformation, and so came to realize that those very gifts required,
demanded almost, that they put them to the service of humanity, whether it be
to help children or women or ordinary people in Afghanistan, the United Kingdom
or Palestine. There was a point where they could no longer bear the suffering
of others, and to the same extent they could not stand the thought of inaction.
In this sense, they all fought against convention, against the communal
delusion that we are separate and independent entities. They all possessed the
courage to be different and so make a difference, shining a light through the
fog of normality, a light made all the brighter because it had its source in
the heart of humanity, the living flame of love. And so this is a book about
love as well, about connection and the wish to bring the greatest possible
well-being and freedom to others.</p>
<p>When ten more children in Los Angeles at risk from the revolving door of
gang warfare and juvenile crime find their way to a better, more hopeful life,
bringing the best of themselves to the community, or when one young woman finds
the hand of friendship without being murdered for simply seeking freedom and
the right to choose her own life, then we can see how the impact of these
people, each working in their own way, is exponential, affecting the lives of
innumerable other human beings in an ever-widening cascading torrent of
interconnections.</p>
<p>The themes and the insights in this book are a formula for our world today,
a message for us all; in fact nothing could be more relevant or more urgent.
These stories are at one and the same time intensely personal and profoundly
universal. They are about humanity, in both senses of the word, from the
collective, our species, to those essential and most noble qualities of the
human heart: kindness and benevolence, altruism and love.</p>
<p><b>What did our story-tellers find on their
journeys?</b> Definitely they will have encountered the great paradoxical and
counter-intuitive truth of the human condition, that taking care of other human
beings is the surest and most reliable way of take caring of our self. Because
for all their gifts and abilities, what they, and we, discover, is that these
seven individuals had one more talent, perhaps the most precious and
far-reaching one of all, a talent for humanity.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Letter to Humanity</b></h3>
<p>Each of our story tellers here was invited to compose a <i>Letter to
Humanity</i>, which follows immediately after their story. In their letters,
they crystallize what they would like to say, from their hearts, to all of us
in the world. At the end of this book, we will find an invitation, where we too
can write our own letter, and express our deepest or most urgent feelings to
people everywhere. In that way, we will gradually become part of an
open-hearted community of people who are passionate about transforming the
world, each in our own different way. </p>

is offered for you to open your heart, and write your ""<i>Letter to

<p>Have you ever been
truly happy? Not just content or pleased, but really deep inside, at peace and
long-term joyously happy. Everyone should have the chance to feel this way, but
so many people struggle to get there. There are all sorts of excuses and
reasons why people can’t or won't achieve happiness.<span>  Most of them can be overcome with the right
tools and the will to use them.</span></p>
<p>We can’t provide
the will, but we can certainly help out with the tools. This Happiness Library
will include 6 books for starters that provide just what you need to achieve
and maintain the happiness you deserve. Now some will ask if this is really a Success
Library. We considered that concept but have learned over the years that all
happiness requires a modicum of success, but not all success leads to happiness.
So you will find tools in this library that address both success and happiness.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>
<br/>What's in The Happiness Library? <br/>
</h3><p></p>
<p>The Happiness
Library includes 6 books averaging 50 – 100 pages each.<span>  The books have specific thoughts, stories,
methodology, exercises and best practices for achieving and maintaining
happiness in your life. The books will be available electronically, and also nicely printed and bound. We hope to
develop more volumes in the future. Here are the first 6 titles:</span></p>

aren't all crowd-sourcing projects somewhat self-serving? Yes we want to sell Happiness
Libraries, raise money and get people involved with us. But if we didn't
believe we were bringing value to people through our writing, speaking,
consulting and media Perks, we would just fold up our tent and go home.  We love what we do and we love giving people
value through our content. We are blessed that we can make a living from it and
that just encourages us to do more of it. 
Here is what we
won't do in this project:

We
won't lie to you.

We
won't exaggerate our purpose 

We
won't leave you hanging
We
won't take money and then ignore you
We
won't let you down.
Anything else I should know?Good question!Here are some additional clarifications:
All of the delivery dates reflect the last possible date we will deliver the Perks.
We will deliver the Perks as they become available or as schedules permit.
We will cover our travel and shipping expenses unless otherwise stated.
Printed items are unavailable internationally due to shipping cost. But if you really really want them, we can make arrangements for you to pay extra for the shipping. 
Yes, we know our video is a bit casual and silly, but then, so are we. 
We will update information after the raise on HappinessLibrary.com
We will be updating information on this project at least once a week here through the campaign and more often through social media.
Hopefully we have answered all of your questions and if not you can always reach out and ask us. We are happy to help. So now that you have no excuse, come on along, join us, and get happy!Thanks to all for your support and consideration.Amilya and Kevin",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I'm Sara Secora, a creative being with the thirst of expression. I am a full-time international voice actress as well as an accomplished author. I have two publications under my belt, and a Goodreads average rating of about 4.5-stars to boot! In the last few years, I've learned that self-publishing has many layers to it; the undeniable ones being that it's arduous and expensive. </p>
<p>Some of you may remember that I held a campaign for my first book in the Amethysta trilogy back in 2016. With your invaluable help, I was able to take some of the burden off my plate as I chased my dream to publish my debut novel, Throne of Lies. Nothing was quite as touching as the feedback by those who had believed in me by supporting my previous campaign. Now I am back, hoping to expand the story I began so many years ago. And I'll need your help for that!</p>

<p><strong>Preeti: </strong>As a reader, I have been fortunate to have read a number of good books but it is also true that there are very few instances, which I can recall, when a book has enraptured me from the very first page itself. This book is surely one of them. It was my pleasant surprise when I felt ‘the pull’ immediately after reading the first few lines. My heart said to my mind – ‘This is the book which both of us will surely enjoy together’ :)</p>
<p><strong>Angela: </strong>This debut is stuffed with the ornate descriptions that are a hallmark of engrossing high fantasy. Secora captures the reckless emotional turmoil of young Amethysta in perfect mimicry of any teenage girl, and her magical allegory is well-used. The world-building is extensive, and it's clear there's a lot more in store. Familiar favorite elements of a romantic fantasy are given refreshing new faces, and the balance between answered questions and new mysteries is perfect. I'm looking forward to the next book!</p>
<p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Wonderful, intense, heartbreaking, and hopeful. Sara has created a brilliant piece from the heart. I highly recommend reading this book for those that enjoy the tensions and struggles of finding oneself amongst the turmoil of duty and the heart. I look forward to the continuation of the trilogy and what may come from Amethysta's hidden past.</p>

<h2>If Not Now: a book for social and environmental justice </h2>
<p><strong>Given a platform to speak, diverse voices have the power to educate and drive positive change. </strong>My name is Elke Numeyer-Windshuttle and I am the founder and editor of<i> If Not Now</i>, a publication for contemporary art, culture and storytelling aligned by visions of an environmentally-harmonised and socially-just future. I am an Australian photographer based in Copenhagen, Denmark where I recently graduated as a photojournalist at the Danish School For Media and Journalism.</p>
<p>I am very interested in the ways humans adapt to unpredictable circumstances, with a particular fascination for our resourcefulness and compassion for one-another during difficult social or environmental transitions. This project aims to give authority to our individuality, to our learned knowledge and to our lived experiences, and serves to demonstrate how these gifts are opportunities toward manifesting large-scale positive change. </p>
<p>With adequate financial support, <i>INN</i>’s first instalment <i>The</i> <i>Resurrected Issue </i>can debut in its appropriate format; <strong>a physical, visually compelling book</strong> exhibiting projects, initiatives and thought-provoking ideas that inform on and challenge some of the greatest issues of our time. INN aims to<strong><i> </i>fill a gap in contemporary cultural media by connecting ethically-tuned readers with today’s flourishing and diverse climate of artistic and cultural activism. </strong>Further, it will give those directly affected by contemporary injustices a platform to raise awareness on important subject matters.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624983411/bzy1lzgzzzpxkblnxmbg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where will the money go?</h3>

</div></div>","If Not Now: a book for social and environmental justice 
Given a platform to speak, diverse voices have the power to educate and drive positive change. My name is Elke Numeyer-Windshuttle and I am the founder and editor of If Not Now, a publication for contemporary art, culture and storytelling aligned by visions of an environmentally-harmonised and socially-just future. I am an Australian photographer based in Copenhagen, Denmark where I recently graduated as a photojournalist at the Danish School For Media and Journalism.
I am very interested in the ways humans adapt to unpredictable circumstances, with a particular fascination for our resourcefulness and compassion for one-another during difficult social or environmental transitions. This project aims to give authority to our individuality, to our learned knowledge and to our lived experiences, and serves to demonstrate how these gifts are opportunities toward manifesting large-scale positive change. 
With adequate financial support, INN’s first instalment The Resurrected Issue can debut in its appropriate format; a physical, visually compelling book exhibiting projects, initiatives and thought-provoking ideas that inform on and challenge some of the greatest issues of our time. INN aims to fill a gap in contemporary cultural media by connecting ethically-tuned readers with today’s flourishing and diverse climate of artistic and cultural activism. Further, it will give those directly affected by contemporary injustices a platform to raise awareness on important subject matters.

 

Where will the money go?
Should INN receive the modest financial support it needs, your donations will go a long way! 70% of raised funds will go directly toward printing costs20% of raised funds will allow fair payment to contributors who have made issue one rich with impact.10% of raised funds will assist with website maintenance, a launch event, and promotional material like posters and merchandise.Surplus funding (should INN  be so lucky) will provide the freedom to work with the most sustainable and fair production possible. Meeting this priority first, any extra surplus will go directly back into the production of INN.02: The Surface Issue.
Naturally, there are some goodies to claim with your donations such as a copy of INN.01,  Collection 01 merchandise,  a fine-art print, or printed advertisement space.

<h3>Askin' for some change.</h3>
<p>For the past four years, I have been writing and researching this project. Many have the milestones been during that time: Graduating from college, moving cross country, starting a career, meeting my soulmate, moving across the world with her. All this growth and change and opportunity has not afforded me much of what I need to finish this book: time to sit and write. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, all of those years of research has revealed two major themes: a) I have a limited understanding of and access to the depth of the Jewish tradition, mostly due to insufficient Hebrew and Aramaic skills and b) my affinity for these two seemingly disparate phenomena (Phish and Judaism) is neither unique nor outlandish.</p>
<p>Here's why I need your funding help:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Dwell:</b> The plight of a freelance journalist/editor in a foreign country is fraught with financial  insecurity. Add to that a desire to further my education by learning Jewish texts part-time in a traditional yeshiva setting, and paying rent becomes quite a challenge. Your contribution will help keep a roof over my head and allow me to focus my energy on completing this book, which includes conducting in-depth (time-consuming) interviews with some key figures in the relevant spheres.</li>
<li>
<b>Design: </b>One of the main goals of this endeavor is to show that there is virtually no difference between the legal/literary discussion that evolved from Torah to Talmud to the never-ending splendor of the modern Jewish text and the vast creative output of Phish and its many fans. A key component of this book will be pages of modern Phish-related commentary that mirror the textual puzzles of the Talmud. Your donation will help me pay a graphic designer to make this dream a reality.</li>
<li>
<b>Develop:</b> As mentioned above, this book is not just about my thoughts on Phish. It's an anthology of collective wisdom. I aim to develop an eBook version of the Phish Talmud that incorporates social media so that anyone who purchases the book can add their own commentary to the text and interact with other readers. The best of the discussions that emerge from here will be collected and printed, God willing, in later volumes of the Phish Talmud project. With your contribution, I can recruit people with programming know-how to help create a truly open-source book.</li>

</h3>
<p><i>“A book to spend a year with. This book is many things, but most of all it is proof positive that if there is any doubt about the origin theory of graphic design, Dwiggins did more to promote, diversify, and integrate the graphic, typographic, and printing-arts disciplines than anyone of his generation.”</i> — <b>Steven Heller</b>, author, art director, and design historian </p>
</div><p><i>“One of the many strengths of this book is that it deals both with Dwiggins’s familiar typefaces — Metro, Electra, Caledonia — and with his </i><i>less well-known types, illustrated with drawings or trial cuttings. The result is the most complete conspectus we have of an extraordinary variety of type designs, and an appreciation of Dwiggins’s virtuosity in full flower.”</i> — <b>Matthew Carter</b><i>, </i> type designer </p><p><i>“To call W. A. Dwiggins a consummate American type designer, calligrapher, book designer, and illustrator is just to get started. Gifted with a superb literary sensibility and a flair for the dramatic, he wrote plays, stories, and crafted marionettes in a theater of his own devising […]. Bruce Kennett has brought Dwiggins to life in this impeccably written and designed biography.</i>”  —<b> Carl Rollyson</b>, biographer of Susan Sontag, Thurgood Marshall, and Rebecca West, among others</p><p>“<i>Dwiggins’s radical explora­tions in marionette theater stand even today as a remarkable contribution to the field.

Designed for the cover of American Alphabets, 1930 William Addison Dwiggins  (1880–1956) was among the most influential and innovative designers of the early twentieth century. He was a master calligrapher, type designer, illustrator, private press printer, and a pioneer of advertising, magazine, and book design. Despite this, too few contemporary designers and design enthusiasts are familiar with the full scope and remarkable creativity of Dwiggins’s work. With your help, we will change that!

Dwiggins: A Life in Design  will offer an engaging and inspiring overview of the designer’s wide-ranging creative output and lasting impact on the graphic arts. Bruce Kennett’s careful research, warm prose, and inclusion of numerous personal accounts from Dwiggins’s friends and contemporaries portray not only a brilliant designer, but a truly likable character. Labels designed by Dwiggins for the spines of a five-volume publication, Limited Editions Club, 1936

 Advance Praise for  W. A. Dwiggins: A Life in Design

“A book to spend a year with. This book is many things, but most of all it is proof positive that if there is any doubt about the origin theory of graphic design, Dwiggins did more to promote, diversify, and integrate the graphic, typographic, and printing-arts disciplines than anyone of his generation.” — Steven Heller, author, art director, and design historian 
“One of the many strengths of this book is that it deals both with Dwiggins’s familiar typefaces — Metro, Electra, Caledonia — and with his less well-known types, illustrated with drawings or trial cuttings. The result is the most complete conspectus we have of an extraordinary variety of type designs, and an appreciation of Dwiggins’s virtuosity in full flower.” — Matthew Carter,  type designer “To call W. A. Dwiggins a consummate American type designer, calligrapher, book designer, and illustrator is just to get started. Gifted with a superb literary sensibility and a flair for the dramatic, he wrote plays, stories, and crafted marionettes in a theater of his own devising […]. Bruce Kennett has brought Dwiggins to life in this impeccably written and designed biography.”  — Carl Rollyson, biographer of Susan Sontag, Thurgood Marshall, and Rebecca West, among others“Dwiggins’s radical explora­tions in marionette theater stand even today as a remarkable contribution to the field. Puppeteers and puppet-interested audiences around the world will be excited and inspired by Kennett’s perceptive analysis of Dwiggins’s essential puppet modernism.” —  John Bell, puppeteer and theater historian“W. A. Dwiggins: A Life in Design  reminds us that living is an art. Bruce Kennett has written and designed a highly satisfying account of the life of the graphic artist and designer that fuses the life and work in a way that Dwiggins himself would have appreciated.” — Stephen Enniss, Director, Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas, AustinDwiggins, cover sketch for his book  Bronabejjia  (never published), 1950  Dust jacket of  Marionette in Motion, Dwiggins’s handbook for engineering and construction, 1939, with one of his marionettes, mid-1930s  Sample engraved banknote Dwiggins designed for  Towards a Reform of the Paper Currency, 1932  Dwiggins’s stencil studies for Thomas Dreier,  The Power of Print—and Men, Mergenthaler Linotype Company, 1936

<h3>The Story of The Fried Chicken Pedicure</h3>
<p>""I’m gonna tell you stories about my life growing up mixed in America, and living mixed in Saudi Arabia, strap in and enjoy the ride.""</p>
<p>My name is Hannah Yasmine Al-Kabour and I'm the author of the fried chicken pedicure. I wrote this book because I wanted to see more stories of mixed kids from the third culture. Writing this book has helped me tackle the more complicated and challenging issues related to my background and made me more confident in my identity.  My Hope is that in reading this book you will discover different viewpoints on identity, upbringing, and family. I'm also hoping you learn more about the underbelly of dateline news America and its long-lasting effects on future generations. I hope you can see this book as a chance to take a quick break from the world and have a laugh with stories from a different walk of life.  Laughing along with wedding debacles in Saudi Arabia and then forgetting for a moment that we are anywhere particular in the world but we're all just people with drama on our wedding days.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you love to follow stories with real people. If you love to laugh and learn about new worlds seen from a unique perspective. All the while reflecting on hilarious relatable challenges from characters, which face universal obstacles that we are all faced with every day.</p>
<p>Fried Chicken Pedicure speaks to mixed kids and people who want to learn about lives from a different perspective. My book has characters from different walks of life with identity struggles up front and center.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope that The Fried Chicken Pedicure inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can identity be shaped or created?</li>
<li>Am I totally prepared when I leave the house?</li>
<li>As human beings should we have a goal to connect more through shared experiences? </li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.</p>

<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093JXSGVT"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The book is now live on Amazon</a>!</h2><p><i>Model Breakers</i> is about the struggle we all experience, the struggle to be fully ourselves.<br/><br/>The most important stories are often left untold in the cultural dialogue. This is certainly the case for Chinese Americans. The insidious model minority stereotype rampant in America has affected the lives of every Chinese person living in the US, who feel vulnerable or invisible. I hope to shatter the model minority stereotype and show why our individual stories and histories matter.<br/><br/>My name is Charlene Wang and I am the author of <i>Model Breakers</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to help my little brother Warren avoid the pitfalls and overcome the stereotypes in America. I started writing to my brother through a series of letters titled, “Dear Warren” that went viral. I investigated the hurdles for Chinese Americans and questioned how to have a fulfilling college—and life—experience in America. While I wasn’t sure how many letters Warren had actually read (he only responded to one), I got overwhelming responses from readers who asked for more. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to break up with the model minority stereotype. In turn, we can change the immigrant narrative at large.<br/><br/><strong>I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the pain and pride of being Chinese in America.</strong> You will learn about how lack of self-awareness made Chinese Americans vulnerable and how lack of community made us victims of the model minority stereotype. You'll learn how to challenge the beliefs that kept us quiet, appeal the rules that limited our dreams, and turn limiting stereotypes into powerful narratives.<br/><br/>I want to redefine where we stand in society.<br/><br/>You'll hear stories such as...</p><ul>
<li>How model minority reinforces that we are “minor” and distant from our true selves</li>
<li>How self-awareness and growth mindset redefine stereotypes in a powerful way </li>
<li>How emotional and social awareness helps us go from surviving to thriving</li>
<li>How it is okay to not feel okay</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you are a Chinese Immigrant who took the risk to come to America and start a new chapter or a Chinese American who does not see themselves as Chinese but does not feel American enough. You will also love this book if you are a curious citizen who wants to learn more about the people in your life that are Chinese.</p><p><i>Model Breakers</i> is a work of nonfiction that speaks to people like my brother Warren—all the first, second, and third-generation Chinese Americans—and allies who want to create empowering identities for themselves. </p><h3>The Book - Model Breakers</h3><p>The book is written in three parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3.</strong><br/><br/>In the 2016 United States Presidential election, the Chinese American voting demographic had one of the lowest voter turnouts. This would indicate Chinese Americans don’t organize, or feel disenfranchised around American politics, which supports the toxic myth that Chinese are “naturally” quiet. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are, after all, talking about the same people who organized the Tiananmen Square Protests — one of the most revolutionary movements in recent history. Now is the time to defend against fragility, redefine the stereotypes, and start our own movement.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 contains chapters 4-8.</strong><br/><br/>Chinese immigrants need a job to survive and a visa to stay — all that could be taken away if we don't fit in. While it is convenient to fit in and follow the rules, it is dangerous to hand our power away. If we don’t think for ourselves, we are subject to the stereotypes and judgments that limit us. To liberate us from the false expectations, we need to know who we are, take the risk to break the model minority, and build networks to change the perceptions at large.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 contains chapters 9-12.</strong><br/><br/>Despite systematic racism, most of the harm is reinforced by the rest of us who have no intention to harm ourselves. <strong>We have invested so much into educating our next generations, but we forgot to invest in our community. </strong>We are so used to coping with microaggressions and bullying that we forget that the world doesn’t have to be this way. We are weaponized as a political token, from “Model Minority” to “Chinese Virus.” It is time for all of us, whether we're studying, starting our professional careers, or becoming a role model to start these conversations and tell our own stories.</p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

I investigated the hurdles for Chinese Americans and questioned how to have a fulfilling college—and life—experience in America. While I wasn’t sure how many letters Warren had actually read (he only responded to one), I got overwhelming responses from readers who asked for more. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to break up with the model minority stereotype. In turn, we can change the immigrant narrative at large.I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the pain and pride of being Chinese in America. You will learn about how lack of self-awareness made Chinese Americans vulnerable and how lack of community made us victims of the model minority stereotype. You'll learn how to challenge the beliefs that kept us quiet, appeal the rules that limited our dreams, and turn limiting stereotypes into powerful narratives.I want to redefine where we stand in society.You'll hear stories such as...
How model minority reinforces that we are “minor” and distant from our true selves
How self-awareness and growth mindset redefine stereotypes in a powerful way 
How emotional and social awareness helps us go from surviving to thriving
How it is okay to not feel okay
You will love this book if you are a Chinese Immigrant who took the risk to come to America and start a new chapter or a Chinese American who does not see themselves as Chinese but does not feel American enough. You will also love this book if you are a curious citizen who wants to learn more about the people in your life that are Chinese.Model Breakers is a work of nonfiction that speaks to people like my brother Warren—all the first, second, and third-generation Chinese Americans—and allies who want to create empowering identities for themselves. The Book - Model BreakersThe book is written in three parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3.In the 2016 United States Presidential election, the Chinese American voting demographic had one of the lowest voter turnouts. This would indicate Chinese Americans don’t organize, or feel disenfranchised around American politics, which supports the toxic myth that Chinese are “naturally” quiet. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are, after all, talking about the same people who organized the Tiananmen Square Protests — one of the most revolutionary movements in recent history. Now is the time to defend against fragility, redefine the stereotypes, and start our own movement.Part 2 contains chapters 4-8.Chinese immigrants need a job to survive and a visa to stay — all that could be taken away if we don't fit in. While it is convenient to fit in and follow the rules, it is dangerous to hand our power away. If we don’t think for ourselves, we are subject to the stereotypes and judgments that limit us. To liberate us from the false expectations, we need to know who we are, take the risk to break the model minority, and build networks to change the perceptions at large.Part 3 contains chapters 9-12.Despite systematic racism, most of the harm is reinforced by the rest of us who have no intention to harm ourselves. We have invested so much into educating our next generations, but we forgot to invest in our community. We are so used to coping with microaggressions and bullying that we forget that the world doesn’t have to be this way. We are weaponized as a political token, from “Model Minority” to “Chinese Virus.” It is time for all of us, whether we're studying, starting our professional careers, or becoming a role model to start these conversations and tell our own stories.What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

The series of books is therefore appropriately named Adventures of Oscar the Beagle.

I am a long time short stories writer and a professional journalist and editor. After the birth of my son I turned to children literature. We love to read children books to our son, and in all those rich and inspiring titles, something was missing. In reading/telling stories family ritual I realised that our Oscar was true inspiration. His funny, sometimes mischievous adventures started to become stories that aspire to fulfil this void.</p><p>With your help, we could reach much wider audience and that is our main goal. The plan is to publish the first three picture books on Amazon in mid October, and Indiegogo campaign will help us make that deadline reality.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Ask not what campaign can give you, ask what you can give to the campaign</strong></p><p>In short, we will spend the campaign budget on production and promotion.

Once freed, Oscar instantly went into a Beagle frenzy sniffing around the flat, looking for who knows what. He had the squeaky voice, clumsy legs, and infinite cute factor. This anarchist, cat among dogs, punk rocker out of the box became our pack member with a bit of his own agenda. Years passed by, and Oscar enjoyed long walks, running on the river bank, in a dog park, playing with other dogs and his pack. Then in his fourth year, we moved to the countryside, he got his backyard, frequent encounters with rabbits and deer, and a lake where he would swim almost every day. Oscar was (and still is) a proud and strong male Beagle, so handsome that he became popular among female Beagle owners, and in a couple of love meetings, he got a total of 16 little Beagle pups.</p><p><strong>Oscar's health issues</strong></p><p>Oscar developed allergies, and first blooming of plants sends him in itching and scratching phase, and as though that wasn’t enough, in his eight year he got diabetes. We check his sugar levels couple of times during the day and he gets his insulin shots accordingly.</p><p>Besides his not so great health, and a couple of gray hairs, he is same untamed Beagle hound. If you come to our garden party, chances are you will throw him his yellow ball a few hours. Loud bark, and waving his tail like crazy is his way to say welcome. Woof, woof, don’t just stand there, throw me the ball. So, you see, Oscar is a true inspiration, real life character for a fictional tales in Adventures of Oscar the Beagle children book series.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>Our main goal is promotion of our work. We feel confident about the Oscar books, children so far liked them and main hurdle is to wrap up production on time and make quality promotion. Books are already written, illustrations are half way through, but there is a lot to do in postproduction and once published we need funds to let people know that extraordinary <i>Adventures of Oscar the Beagle</i> are just one click away.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Support Adventures of Oscar the Beagle</strong></p><ul>

Vaša potpora nam je bitna kako bi završili s produkcijom slikovnica, ali i zbog promocije i kako bi istaknuli Oskarove avanture u mnoštvu izdanja na Amazonu. Svi koji nas podrže svoje će perkove dobiti na hrvatskom jeziku, počevši od knjiga, postera, preko majica i ilustracija s posvetom. Avanture bigla Oscara traže svoj put na najveće svjetsko tržište, a u isto vrijeme se nalaze kod hrvatskih izdavača i čekaju zeleno svjetlo. U slikovnici Oscar je glavni lik, njegov najbolji prijatelj je dječak Noel, a stalni likovi su zec Mato i Jelen Luka, te majka. Dio u pričama je labavo utemeljen na stvarnim anegdotama, no veći dio je čista fikcija s nekim dodirnim točkama u karakteru likova. Oskarove avanture naglašavaju važnost povjerenja, obitelji i prijatelja, a glavna je ideja da postanu dio literature koju čitate djeci ili sa djecom.

Whether it is dark, rainy and cold November or hot sunny July, I’m blessed to have adventures every day. Everyone who had a beagle pet in their lives will know about this feeling, and hopefully all the others will find out through Adventures of Oscar The Beagle.Many times, Oscar’s nose got him in trouble, but we kind of look at it as though it was his superpower, and if we compare his sense of smell to human, it certainly is. The series of books is therefore appropriately named Adventures of Oscar the Beagle. Oscar has been a devoted family member for nine beautiful years, and he is also a fictional character in the series of children books, along with his fictional friends based on real life characters, a boy Noel, Dear Dave, Moe the Jolly Rabbit, Noel’s mother and many other. Broken Chair is the title of the first book in the series. Tom Skerlets, the illustrator, finished his great job on maiden book, and now he is in the process of illustrating Little Yellow Ball. The Trouble with the Pie is waiting its turn.(more on Oscar's stories )I’m (Dinko) the author of the books. I am a long time short stories writer and a professional journalist and editor. After the birth of my son I turned to children literature. We love to read children books to our son, and in all those rich and inspiring titles, something was missing. In reading/telling stories family ritual I realised that our Oscar was true inspiration. His funny, sometimes mischievous adventures started to become stories that aspire to fulfil this void.With your help, we could reach much wider audience and that is our main goal. The plan is to publish the first three picture books on Amazon in mid October, and Indiegogo campaign will help us make that deadline reality. Ask not what campaign can give you, ask what you can give to the campaignIn short, we will spend the campaign budget on production and promotion. More specifically, 35% will go for finishing illustrations in Adventures of Oscar the Beagle books. The next 15% are the costs of proofreading and professional editing support, while the remaining part of Indiegogo funding will go for promotion after we publish first three books in autumn.For your support there are a few cool rewards. Our gratitude and personal note is the first step and it will go to everyone that help us. Adventures of Oscar the Beagle in an ebook form, tabloid size poster, paperback edition, t-shirt, custom illustration and hardcover copy for most enthusiastic supporters are in store. Check out our perks and pick one, we think they are worth the money. Wonderfull Beagle world“Once upon a time” is probably the most used first sentence in fairy tales. For me, it brings out great feelings of being around your children just before they go to sleep. Reading to your kid is surreal experience, time for bonding and learning about words, things, language and situations while being totally relaxed at the same time.Wonderful world of Oscar’s adventures will try to insert itself into this sacred ritual of reading to or with children.#realoscarOscar came to us in a box. Once freed, Oscar instantly went into a Beagle frenzy sniffing around the flat, looking for who knows what. He had the squeaky voice, clumsy legs, and infinite cute factor. This anarchist, cat among dogs, punk rocker out of the box became our pack member with a bit of his own agenda. Years passed by, and Oscar enjoyed long walks, running on the river bank, in a dog park, playing with other dogs and his pack. Then in his fourth year, we moved to the countryside, he got his backyard, frequent encounters with rabbits and deer, and a lake where he would swim almost every day. Oscar was (and still is) a proud and strong male Beagle, so handsome that he became popular among female Beagle owners, and in a couple of love meetings, he got a total of 16 little Beagle pups.Oscar's health issuesOscar developed allergies, and first blooming of plants sends him in itching and scratching phase, and as though that wasn’t enough, in his eight year he got diabetes. We check his sugar levels couple of times during the day and he gets his insulin shots accordingly.Besides his not so great health, and a couple of gray hairs, he is same untamed Beagle hound. If you come to our garden party, chances are you will throw him his yellow ball a few hours. Loud bark, and waving his tail like crazy is his way to say welcome. Woof, woof, don’t just stand there, throw me the ball. So, you see, Oscar is a true inspiration, real life character for a fictional tales in Adventures of Oscar the Beagle children book series. Risks & ChallengesOur main goal is promotion of our work. We feel confident about the Oscar books, children so far liked them and main hurdle is to wrap up production on time and make quality promotion. Books are already written, illustrations are half way through, but there is a lot to do in postproduction and once published we need funds to let people know that extraordinary Adventures of Oscar the Beagle are just one click away. Support Adventures of Oscar the Beagle

However, if you asked Francis what he was, he would first and foremost have described himself as a poet. It was something he lived and breathed, it was the truest expression of his soul. It was so personal to him that for the most part he didn’t even share it with me, though we shared everything else. We were a couple for so long that people tended to see us as a single unit. I loved that he had this one part of his life that he called his own, one that was not absorbed into the “us” and “we” of “Francis and Bruce”. It was truly his secret world, where he could commune with his innermost spirit. <br/>Over the years, I urged Francis to publish this book. While he often agreed, it seemed that he was reticent to let it out into the world. Public criticism and rejection of work that was so deeply personal hurt him immensely. He was so sensitive to the opinions of people he respected that the idea they might not understand or connect with his work terrified him. I think he knew that only after his death could this collection be published. <br/>Over the last week, since Francis’ death, many have asked me if there is anything that they could do to make this time easier for me. My answer is this: please join with me to celebrate Francis’ life by publishing this work in the style and manner that a great painter, journalist, and poet would have wanted. While I have the resources to do this myself, it would mean so much more to Francis that gifts freely given by his friends, peers, and loved ones demonstrated their love for him and their belief in his great talent.<br/>The money that I am raising for this campaign will go to independently publishing THE GREAT GODS, so that it may be distributed among his friends and colleagues. Regardless of amount, anyone who donates to the cause will receive two copies of the book, one for themselves and one to donate to their local public library. It was important to him, as the last of the Toohey line, that his work live on. THE GREAT GODS will be published in trade paperback form. It will be released and shipped in time for his memorial service, to be held this December in the Boston area. The book will also include an audio recording of Francis reading the poems, so that his friends may hear his voice once again. Any excess funds will be used to publish more copies to be donated to libraries and to friends who were not in a position to donate, or who may not have heard of the campaign in time. <br/>In addition to the book, all donors will receive a small piece of Francis’ original artwork as a memento, and will be listed as contributors in alphabetical order.

<p>My name is Tyler Talbert and on
June 8<sup>th</sup>, I will be traveling to South Korea for two weeks in
preparation for future mission work. I am a Junior Religious Studies major at
the University of Findlay and am looking at a future in mission.</p>
<p>I will be going to South Korea
for two purposes. The first is to learn about and absorb as much of the culture
as I can. The second is to make connections with churches and ministries so that I
can be involved in there. I will be specifically looking for groups that minister
to resettled North Koreans and that are preparing for missions to North Korea.
During the past few years, God has given me a desire for justice for those who
live on the fringes and I hope to do God’s will in both administering justice
and the Gospel. This trip is the first step for me to do these things for the
Korean people.</p>
<p>That being said, while this is a
personal trip and I am not going through a larger organization, it is not a vacation.
I will be doing a lot of work to learn the language and a lot of travel to
speak with different churches and ministries.</p>
<p>Above all else, I need your
prayers, Jesus name has the power to overcome and He ultimately holds the keys
to his Kingdom, but I will also need help in funding this endeavor. If you are
able, I would appreciate any donations that you can make toward this trip. Please share this with anyone who you think would be interested as well. It
will be both a blessing and an honor to be a part of the mission of God with
you. The ticket to get there and back costs about two thousand dollars and it’s
estimated that I will need about eighteen hundred dollars for travel and
expenses while I am there.</p>
<p>Thank you for your prayers and
your time. I look forward to this experience and finding what God has called me
to do.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1426953/files/20150429153613-CB041815_PhotoKitchen_MG_2998.jpg?1430346973"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h3>I Want to Empower You</h3> <p><i><b>Return to Ease: Gently Reconnect with Your Body's Natural Mobility and Joy</b></i> is more than a book.  It is a project that has taken on a life of its own.  I originally wanted to write a book to help people feel more comfortable in their bodies, easily and on their own, but it became so much more than that during the process of writing.</p>
<p>I have been in the business of empowering people for over 15 years.  I am a massage therapist, and I have seen the discomfort people experience in their bodies.  And I have also witnessed the profound opening that happens in a person's life when this discomfort is released.  Although I help my clients every day to achieve that release, I wanted to help people experience the gift of ease on their own and with their own hands.  A way to empower my clients and those around them to create a daily practice of returning to the natural ease, mobility, and joy we are all seeking.</p>
<p>Enter the idea for this book.  The most wonderful thing about that ease, mobility, and joy we are seeking is that we don't need to look very far.  That abundance is our natural state so it is within each one of us.  The ease we are searching for is hiding underneath the restrictions we experience - we just need some simple, easy tools to uncover it.</p>
<p>I wrote this book to empower you to claim your ease, your mobility, and your joy!</p> </div> <div> <h3>About the Book</h3> <p>What do you need to know about this book?  Only everything! Luckily ""everything"" is simple and easy, and that's what makes it so profound in my life and to everyone else who has read the book or participated in the book's creation.</p>
<p><b>The Basics:</b> <i>Return to Ease</i> is separated in four major sections:</p>
<p><b><i>Let's Get Started:</i></b>  This section explains the purpose of the book, the hidden messages of our discomfort and restrictions, how we can return to our natural state of joy and mobility, and how we can connect with the beauty within us and around us.</p>
<p><b><i>Let's Get Centered: </i></b> Before entering into a physical journey, it is important to align your mind and spirit with your body.  In this section, I've provided some great strategies and tools to help you do this: grounding techniques, a body scan and meditation, breathing techniques, and a gratitude practice.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1427002/files/20150429155500-CB041815_PhotoKitchen_MG_2958.jpg?1430348100"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b><i>Let's Get Moving: </i></b> Here's the physical movement to gently and comfortably create more ease in your body! I have compiled the most effective and enjoyable self-care available with foam rollers, the Super Pink Ball, gentle movement, and stretching.  This section includes written instructions for all of the techniques along with 49 professional photos of each technique in motion.  You don't need anything else but your body, a couple of simple tools (a soft foam roller and a Super Pinky Ball), and five minutes each day.  That's all - simple, enjoyable, and effective in the privacy of your own home and on your own time!

<b><i>Expanding Your Skills:</i></b>  So once you have explored and adventured through the book, I want to keep your expansion moving outward!  I have compiled the best resources to my knowledge to help further your journey.  These select books, websites, and other resources are available to you with a explanation from me as to why they have been helpful to me and the clients with whom I work on a regular basis.</div> <div> <h3>The Beauty in This Journey</h3> <p>What you will notice as you are navigating and exploring your way through the mind, body, and spirit techniques is that this book is simply beautiful and breathtaking.  This is not an accident.  There are four photographers who have contributed work to this amazing project:</p>

<h3>Why Me?</h3>
<div>I have experienced first hand with my own daily practice what works to identify and release the tension in our bodies.  Everything in this book is a product of my experimentation with myself and the work I do with my clients.</div>
<h3>Why You?</h3>At this point in the process, I need your help to bring this book to life and have it printed.  I have poured everything into this book: my heart and soul, all of the loving kindness and compassion within me, and the dreams I have for all of you.</div>
<div>I am so committed to my vision for this book that I realized early on I would need to self-publish.  I wanted to create the book that we all need, not a book that would fit into a publisher's niche.  This book is different.  It is beautiful and gentle and inspiring.  It wouldn't be all of those things if I had to adhere to a publisher's template and ideas for a book using foam rollers and balls.</div>
<div>It takes tens of thousands of dollars and a team of highly specialized people to publish the book that I envision for us.  And now is the time for me to turn over the reins:  to empower you to help us bring this book to life.  I need to raise $20,000 in order to print this book.  I can't do this alone, but together we can create the physical product that we all need and want.</div>
<div>Join me.  Together we can be ambassadors of Ease and Joy!</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This project is in its final stages.  All the printing details have been worked through, including the first prototype.  The editor, graphic designer, and photographers have all played their parts to bring you an excellent high-quality product.  The rewards are in place, the post office has been consulted, the cover design is finalized, the marketing plan has begun, and I am ready to do whatever it takes to share our book with everyone!</p>
<p>What could go wrong? Oh, plenty of things.  We could have a printing glitch, items could get lost in the mail...but I'm up for whatever challenges arise and I have surrounded myself with a cavalry of skilled people who believe in this project as much as I do.  We will be able to work through anything that comes our way.  Everything always comes together in the end.</p>
<p>This project is ready to come to you, but only if you lend your support!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Imagine a child (poor or rich) facing life disruptions caused by divorce or relocation, finding out that even with such circumstances she/he can still become President of the United States.  Would that help keep their hope up and foster their belief in their own potential?  We think so and we want to tell that story using innovative technology.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>At <a href=""http://www.sharing-books.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Sharing Books site"">Sharing-Books</a> We help authors of children books e-publish and find an audience.  And we invest time and effort in developping interesting children books into interactive books for tablets.  We do this because we believe tablets will soon become an important education tool for children, and because we have committed to give 1/3 of the sales revenue from these books to help <a href=""http://www.roomtoread.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Room to Read Site"">Room to Read</a> accomplish its mission to foster literacy and education gender equality in developping nations.  The author and illustrator get another 1/3 of the book revenue, and we operate a very lean team with the last 1/3. And of course we have a lot of fun building these interactive books!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are seeking your investment to help us fund the development of an interactive tablet book called <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Island Child</span>.  This is a book relating the first ten years of Barack Obama's life.  It is not a partisan book.  It simply tells the story of a child with a disrupted early life who is now President of the United States.  It shows to children living similar circumstances that they have great potential.  We love the book and we want to create an interactive book with it.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This is our second interactive book.  You can find more about the first one at <a href=""http://www.augusterodent.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Auguste Interactive Tablet Book"">www.augusterodent.com</a><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Whether you are a democrat or a republican, right wing or left wing, you will see the value of the real lesson of this book.  Barack Obama's early life was highly disrupted.  This is the reality of a large number of children today who are caught in separations, divorces and multiple re-locations.  The universal lesson here, the hope to share with children, is that you can still become President of the United States even if your childhood has been disrupted by events outside your control.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This lesson is intuitive, Oklahoma storyteller <a href=""http://http://storyspinning.net/index.php?page=home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Loralee Cooley Profile"">Loralee Cooley</a> sticks to describing the first ten years of President Obama's life from a child's perspective.  She did extensive research and added a wealth of factoids about the various locations where President Obama lived.  These factoids offer us opportunities to develop interactive features to keep young readers entertained while learning.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The book has been illustrated by Kingston, Canada, artist <a href=""http://http://www.amuniversal.com/ups/features/hollywreath/gilliland.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Jillian Hulme Gilliland Profile"">Jilian Hulme Gilliland</a> using a black and white ink drawing style that gives the book a great charm.  Sharing-Books <a href=""http://http://www.dreamvisualdesign.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Drea Morin Profile"">designer Drea Morin</a>, an Adobe Design Achievement Award Nominee based in Santa Monica, will enhance the book using a silouhette style and prepare it for interactive features.  Sharing-Books visual communicator <a href=""http://www.http://kelseyarmour.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Kelsey Armour Profile"">Kelsey Armour</a>, also an Adobe Design Achievement Award nominee will turn our ideas into reality.  This is a US-Canada collaboration of artists devoted to children.<br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Because we keep everything virtual, we are extremely efficient with our funds.  We are seeking $9,000 to pay for the time of the digital artists involved.  This is a minuscule budget for this type of project, but we have learned much from our first interacitve book and we know we can produce a quality interactive book very fast.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We hope that by investing in this project you will get the same sense of purpose we feel in telling a story that will inspire kids living a disrupted childhood.  <br/></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Of course, like all IndiGoGo campaigns, we need and appreciate your help in passing our project to all your friends who you think will see the value of inspiring kids to believe they can overcome unfavourable circumstances.<br/></p>

<h2>DIARIO QDL</h2>
<p>Salve a tutti. Ecco a voi la prima edizione del diario di “Quelli del linguistico”, l’unico diario dedicato agli studenti del liceo linguistico. Siamo 2 ragazzi che hanno l’obiettivo di alleggerire le infinite ore di scuola, cercando di strapparvi una risata in mezzo a russo, francese, spagnolo, tedesco e chi più ne ha più ne metta. Durante quest’anno abbiamo dedicato moltissimo tempo ed energie alla realizzazione di questo progetto, e questa campagna è la realizzazione di un nostro sogno e il vedere ripagato ogni nostro sforzo. La parte fondamentale del progetto siete voi. </p>
<h3>COME FUNZIONA?</h3>
<p>Per acquistare un diario e far sì che arrivi direttamente a casa tua entro l’inizio della scuola basta cliccare su una delle opzioni d’acquisto che si trova qua sotto. Seleziona l’opzione che preferisci e Indiegogo ti guiderà nell’acquisto. Il sito è assolutamente sicuro e il pagamento verrà confermato attraverso una ricevuta via mail. Tutta la procedura del pagamento è esclusivamente gestita dal sito.</p>
<h3>COME UTILIZZEREMO I SOLDI RACCOLTI?</h3>
<p>I soldi raccolti verranno utilizzati per pagare la stampa e la spedizione in tutta Italia del prodotto. Infatti noi, essendo normali studenti, non abbiamo la possibilità economica per auto-finanziarci. Per potervi fornire un diario di qualità abbiamo bisogno di raggiungere un obiettivo minimo, grazie al quale potremmo dare il via alla stampa e iniziare le spedizioni. L’acquisto su questo sito equivale a una prevendita: acquistando il diario durante i giorni della campagna, lo riceverete direttamente a casa entro fine agosto/primissimi giorni di settembre.</p>
<h3>COSA RICEVERETE?</h3>
<p>Facendo un ordine riceverete entro i tempi previsti il diario QDL direttamente a casa vostra. Ci sono varie opzioni d’acquisto: il diario QDL  base è lo stesso per ogni pacchetto, ma è possibile ricevere un diario firmato dagli admin oppure avere il proprio nome fra la menzioni speciali in fondo al diario. E’ inoltre possibile acquistare anche più diari contemporaneamente così da ricevere uno sconto (classi, amici, scuole). Per usufruire di questa possibilità è necessario contattarci attraverso la mail (quellidellinguistico@gmail.com) o tramite Instagram (@quelli_del_linguistico).</p>
<h3>ALTRI MODI PER AIUTARE</h3>
<p>L’acquisto del diario non è l’unico modo per supportare il progetto. Per aiutarci infatti potete parlarne con i vostri amici, i vostri compagni di classe e magari anche con i professori. Ci aiutereste infatti a spargere la voce il più possibile. </p>
<p>Comunque vada la campagna ci teniamo a ringraziarvi per il supporto che ci avete dimostrato in questi mesi sulla pagina e che siamo sicuri continuerete a dimostrarci durante questa campagna. Ci state aiutando a realizzare un sogno, a portare avanti un progetto del quale voi siete la colonna portante. <br/>Grazie mille linguisti!</p>

<h2><i><strong>Story of My Book</strong></i></h2>
<p><i>It Can Happen To You: The True Stories of Waltham’s Homeless Community</i> includes stories and insights from over 20 individuals experiencing homelessness within my college town, Waltham, MA. Over the course of four months, I had the unique opportunity to learn about each of their stories and how they perceive their community. You will hear the stories of individuals with college degrees and stables jobs, those who immigrated to America hoping for a better life, army veterans, and those who grew up in abusive households, subjected to sexual assault and drugs. You will hear stories from people who will most likely remind you of someone you know.<br/><br/>Hi, my name is Renée Nakkab and I am the author of <i>It Can Happen to You, the True Stories Behind Waltham’s Homeless Community</i>. I was compelled to write this book after I overheard a conversation walking behind a couple in Manhattan. The couple was making rash assumptions and generalizations about the people experiencing homelessness they were passing on the streets. They never asked these individuals why or how they came into their current situations, and instead relied solely on stereotypes and labels. After I heard the couple calling the homeless “alcoholic bums with nothing to live for”, I’d had enough. Therefore, I created this book as a method of facilitation. I believe everyone should have a defense if they would like one, thus this book gives people experiencing homelessness an opportunity to share their stories in hopes of combating the stereotyping and labeling they endure as a community. The book is written to inspire change.<br/><br/>My hope for this book is that it resonates in the hearts of those who read it. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for helping the homeless in you. After reading the different but unifying stories of people experiencing homelessness, I want readers to feel an urge to go help through volunteering, donation and activism. I want this book to inspire the next wave of homeless rights activists<br/><br/><strong><i>In this book, you'll learn about the commonality and blindness of homelessness:</i></strong></p>
<p>Homelessness does not discriminate. If you were a runt of the foster care system who faced constant physical and emotional abuse, a forced drug addict from age nine, an immigrant chasing the American dream or a masters degree recipient from a well-to-do family, you can become homeless. You will read about Serena, who received her masters degree from North Eastern University and had a stable job out of college that she enjoyed. Serena was also gang raped in her first week of undergraduate university, and when she wanted to press charges her wealthy parents stopped talking to her. Serena lost her familial ties, and due to lack of support fell in with a bad crowd. Serena could never have imagined she’d be homeless, let alone be homeless for the past two years.</p>
<p>It can happen to you. The reality is that no individual is safe from experiencing homelessness. The tables can turn within the blink of an eye and your entire world can turn upside down. As you read these stories, you will most likely find similarities between you, your family and your friends and those you read about. I urge you to gain a new level of empathy for these individuals after reading about their lives and how they came to this point.</p>
<p>People need your help. There are ways for you to contribute your altruism and aid to this dire situation. Whether it be through hands on approaches such as volunteering in a soup kitchen or donating a winter coat, or through more quantifiable approaches such as donating money or giving a person experiencing homelessness a job, there is a lot you can do.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you are an individual who wants to help. If you want to learn more about the homeless community and how to protect it through different methods of activism, then this book is for you.</p>

It Can Happen To You: The True Stories of Waltham’s Homeless Community includes stories and insights from over 20 individuals experiencing homelessness within my college town, Waltham, MA. Over the course of four months, I had the unique opportunity to learn about each of their stories and how they perceive their community. You will hear the stories of individuals with college degrees and stables jobs, those who immigrated to America hoping for a better life, army veterans, and those who grew up in abusive households, subjected to sexual assault and drugs. You will hear stories from people who will most likely remind you of someone you know.Hi, my name is Renée Nakkab and I am the author of It Can Happen to You, the True Stories Behind Waltham’s Homeless Community. I was compelled to write this book after I overheard a conversation walking behind a couple in Manhattan. The couple was making rash assumptions and generalizations about the people experiencing homelessness they were passing on the streets. They never asked these individuals why or how they came into their current situations, and instead relied solely on stereotypes and labels. After I heard the couple calling the homeless “alcoholic bums with nothing to live for”, I’d had enough. Therefore, I created this book as a method of facilitation. I believe everyone should have a defense if they would like one, thus this book gives people experiencing homelessness an opportunity to share their stories in hopes of combating the stereotyping and labeling they endure as a community. The book is written to inspire change.My hope for this book is that it resonates in the hearts of those who read it. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for helping the homeless in you. After reading the different but unifying stories of people experiencing homelessness, I want readers to feel an urge to go help through volunteering, donation and activism. I want this book to inspire the next wave of homeless rights activistsIn this book, you'll learn about the commonality and blindness of homelessness:
Homelessness does not discriminate. If you were a runt of the foster care system who faced constant physical and emotional abuse, a forced drug addict from age nine, an immigrant chasing the American dream or a masters degree recipient from a well-to-do family, you can become homeless. You will read about Serena, who received her masters degree from North Eastern University and had a stable job out of college that she enjoyed. Serena was also gang raped in her first week of undergraduate university, and when she wanted to press charges her wealthy parents stopped talking to her. Serena lost her familial ties, and due to lack of support fell in with a bad crowd. Serena could never have imagined she’d be homeless, let alone be homeless for the past two years.
It can happen to you. The reality is that no individual is safe from experiencing homelessness. The tables can turn within the blink of an eye and your entire world can turn upside down. As you read these stories, you will most likely find similarities between you, your family and your friends and those you read about. I urge you to gain a new level of empathy for these individuals after reading about their lives and how they came to this point.
People need your help. There are ways for you to contribute your altruism and aid to this dire situation. Whether it be through hands on approaches such as volunteering in a soup kitchen or donating a winter coat, or through more quantifiable approaches such as donating money or giving a person experiencing homelessness a job, there is a lot you can do.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><br/><i>The Age of Taylor Swift: How power in the music industry is shifting</i><br/><br/>My book is about how the music industry is at a pivotal point of change. Artists from X Ambassadors to Taylor Swift are using social media, streaming, and touring to release music, interact with their fan bases, and create social change in a different way. The path to success in music lies more in the hands of the fans directly rather than through typical industry means.<br/><br/>My name is Emily Gumbulevich and I am the author of The Age of Taylor Swift: How power in the music industry is shifting. I wrote this book because as a music fan myself, I was curious about why some bands are able to grow and achieve success while some others are not. In trying to answer that question, I uncovered the mystery behind the music industry has it has been and where it is going — and it’s heading towards a future where ordinary fans like me have more power than we thought to make an impact on the success of our favorite artists.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how much of an impact you can have on the success of your favorite artists. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for music in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you contribute to building a new music industry that has artists at the center and the top, not the bottom.<br/><br/>In this book you’ll learn about the music industry through time and what it means to be a good fan, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>how Taylor Swift has used social media to challenge the status quo of the “old” music industry and expose the forces at work to siphon money from artists</li>
<li>how seemingly successful artists like DREAMDIVE still have to work side jobs to pay rent</li>
<li>how fans I interviewed and I were able to meet favorite bands and become friends with them, producing an extra special live music experience</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you love seeing live music and want to better understand how the industry works.<br/><br/><i>The Age of Taylor Swift</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to music lovers and supporters of the arts who are looking at a brief history of the music industry and how fans have power in the industry.</p>
<h2>The Book - The Age of Taylor Swift: How power in the music industry is shifting</h2>

<li>Part 2 dives deeper into the reasons why we’re at such a pivotal moment for change in the industry and how fans can further perpetuate those conditions for change (while still having fun and enjoying the music they love). Part 2 includes branding advice from a Director of Marketing at LiveNation, stories from fans who have enjoyed live music all over the world, and an inside look at the life of an emerging artist.</li>
<li>Part 3 explores some of the new technology startups that are seizing the moment of change in the industry to help artists and concludes with a call to all fans to seize the day and help move the industry towards supporting the artist.</li>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hello, ninjit don chaa, how are you? My name is Matt Gilbert. I’m Gwich’in Athabascan. I grew up in Arctic Village, but travelled a lot in my young life, but moved back home to write my books. I have a Bachelors of Arts in English-Rhetoric and I have a Masters of Arts in Rural Development.</p>
<p>This is a Crowdfunding campaign to raise funds to finish my regional climate impact report and print copies of my finished Gwich’in Cartography Book. I am right at the Finish line with my 15 years of work among my people. You will help me finish my work once and for all, so I can retire and do other things.</p>
<p>You will no less than help me save my Gwich’in people’s culture. The Gwich’in landuse mapbook took me eight years to write and it’s now finished. My people have forgotten most of this landuse knowledge, but thanks to Rick Caulfield’s 1980 traditional mapping work and building off it, I will be able to restore this knowledge. The mapbooks are on trails and placenames on those trails, but also traplines and camps too.</p>
<p>The Gwich’in mapbook encompasses all six Gwich’in villages and the mapbooks have been sent to all the village councils. The second book is a regional climate impact report for the three main Gwich’in communities: Arctic Village, Venetie, and Fort Yukon. I did the first report in 2005 when I won a prestigious fellowship from the National Wildlife Federation and a matching grant from Arctic Borderlands Eco-Knowledge Network.</p>
<p>It was very thorough and first of its king. Sadly, it’s still is the first of its kind 15 years later, which is why I am trying to put it out. The US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service financed me writing and producing the 2005 Gwich’in Climate Report, but UA Press says they are interested but want an Update.</p>
<p>I am writing the second 2020 Update Report now. It will be a very important book, because President Trump has pushed to develop the Arctic and the book can give Gwich’in a voice on the matter. These two books are going to be magnanimous and significant to the Gwich’in.</p>
<p><strong>What We need &amp; What you will get</strong></p>
<p>I need $2000. It should be enough to make print copies of the mapbook and postage to distribute them to villages. The rest of the funds should cover my living expenses as I finish the 2020 Updates to the Regional Gwich’in Climate Impact Report.</p>
<p>The perks are Gwich’in Life Postcards I made. In the past, I had a hard time making copies for the donors, so this time I will email you PDF copies of the Gwich’in Life Postcards. You can make as many as you want.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you will ensure the Gwich’in preserve their land knowledge by granting me funds to distribute the books out to the Gwich’in communities. You will also ensure the Gwich’in have their voices out on climate change, when our President is bent on destroying the Arctic. They will also have a better sense of their landuse from my Gwich’in Cartography books too.</p>
<p>There is a chance the project may not be completed even <u>with</u> your funds, because it tends to take a lot longer than I expect. Nonetheless, I will work on it, even if I’m broke. I will continue to work until it’s done.</p>
<p>Even if I don’t finish the Regional Climate Report with your fund, I will get a huge amount of work done with your fund.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The two books are important to you, because the Gwich’in books will be great contributions to our literature on the Arctic and its indigenous peoples. The books will assist the Gwich’in in reviving their culture. For the world entire, the Gwich’in Voice can contribute to the global climate change discussion and it is an important one. The indigenous peoples have an unmatched knowledge of the environment and they can assist the world with adaption and disaster plans.   </p>
<p>My track record speaks loudly about my ability to do this work, because I’m basically the only one doing this work and the only one who can. I wanted to quit many times, but realized if I didn’t do this work, no one would, because no one can and these Elders were getting old, so it left me with no choice but to do it.</p>
<p>I completed my thesis in 2010 on Translations of the Ancient Elder Stories of my village, then, it lead to a film on my grandpa visiting sites, and then it lead to the Gwich’in Mapbook Series that took eight years and the two Regional Gwich’in Climate Impact Reports. I have made many sacrifices and have done this work impoverished, because it doesn’t pay well. It has made my life hard, lonely, and isolated, so I am ready for it to end. I want to retire and do other things, you will help me with this goal.  </p>
<p>Please help me finish this for good.  </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>There may be more obstacles for this work to be completed, but I have overcome them many times in the past and I can overcome them again. I have been tempered by hardship of poverty, danger, and sacrifice from this work, so I feel there is little I can’t handle to finish these two books.</p>
<p>The biggest obstacle will be poverty and lack of funding, so that is where you can help me. I am use to doing this for free and using regular jobs to cover living expenses to complete it, but I hope this does not happen (as it has many times) this time. I am confident your funds will be sufficient and I can avoid this being too much of a hardship.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You can Help</strong></p>
<p>The other way you can assist besides funds is offering connections of who can assist me in funding this project and printing copies of the books, so I can get them to the Gwich’in. If you have access to printing services or know someone who has printing services, do let me know.</p>
<p>I can also use your connections to distribute and get the word out on these books, so the Gwich’in will have their voices heard.</p>
<p>You can use the Indiegogo Share tool and share it online, so maybe others can fund my campaign as well!</p>
<p>Thank you all very much in advance</p>

<h3>Who is Carl, and what makes <i>Amongst the Rubble</i> so different? </h3>
<p>Howdy Y'all!</p>
<p>My name is Carl McKay, author and resident DADPAT expert based out of the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. Raised an Army Brat where I traveled the world, you could say I've had no shortage of adventure. I have a Bachelor's of Science in Homeland Security from Eastern Kentucky University, and did two years with two AmeriCorps Disaster Response Teams. Tapping into this unique background, I hope to bring a fresh taste and sense of realism to my novels.</p>
<p>I have read my fair share of novels in the apocalyptic genre and noticed that a lot of them- especially a lot of the successful ones- all give the reader the same indescribable feeling, and many follow the same general template. My goal is to write a novel that not only stands out in an over-saturated genre, but also leave the reader with a describable feeling and leaves the reader on the edge of their seat, not knowing what will happen next. The feedback I have received from beta readers tells me that this goal has been accomplished; now I want to share it with all y'all!</p>
<p>The novel is six years in the making, from the dream that inspired it to sending it to my editor a couple months back. It has gone through rigorous rewrites and changes to make it the best-possible telling of the characters' experience as I can.</p>
<p>This all said, I am seeking help from courageous and adventurous Rubble Walkers such as yourself to make this dream come true. While I am self-publishing, there are still costs associated with getting a book published- if you want to do it right that is. I am asking for the campaign minimum help me complete the editing process that my novel- and my fans- deserve.</p>
<p>While I have the campaign set for 60 days, the sooner the goal is reached, the sooner I can wrap up the process and get it published in time for this holiday season!</p>
<h3><strong>Amongst the Rubble: A Summary</strong></h3>
<p>It’s 20 years after a series of catastrophic natural and man-made disasters, spurred by a meteor named Hellstorm hitting Central China, nearly wiped out Humanity. But after a long, hard road Humanity is slowly starting to recover semblances of civilization across the hostile planet.</p>
<p>Evan McCoy wakes up in the small survivor settlement of Emporia with no memory of how he got there- or who he is. After being taken prisoner, he is rescued by the local resistance movement led by Ellie Malone, who begs for his help in their effort. After initially refusing, a turn of events forces Evan’s hand.  He agrees to help the resistance overthrow the oppressive and corrupt “mayor” of Emporia Malcolm Carver in exchange for their assistance in recovering his memory.</p>
<p>But not everything is as it seems in this new and dangerous world, as Evan struggles to remember his past while simultaneously surviving everything the world throws at him. And to make matters worse, he keeps seeing visions of a beautiful red headed woman, of whom he has no memory of.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I am a man of total honesty, and as such I would like to state the following:</p>
<p>My original goal was $300, but since $500 is the minimum goal you can request, I have kept it at that minimum. The editor fees are approximately $300, and any money that is raised beyond this goal will be used for any unforeseen self-publishing costs associated with this release. Any remaining funds after the novel is released will be set aside for additional expenses, such as promotions, that may come up. Additionally, I would like to note that the $300 goal (let alone the $500) is a dream come true to me if reached. I do not expect to reach this goal, but every dollar donated greatly helps in the goal of getting this book edited and out to y'all without extreme delay. And as I mentioned before, if the goal is reached, barring any unforeseen circumstances, I am looking at a December 2018 release!</p>
<p>But don't worry! Much like apocalyptic survivors, I love a good barter system. If I may direct your attention to the right side of the page, you will find the various donation tiers and their associated perks!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As I have said earlier in the introductory section, my novel has already had an impact on the lives of fans and beta readers. Some reviews include:</p>
<p><i>""What the [EXPLETIVE] is WRONG WITH YOU? Seriously??? That's the end? SERIOUSLY? WHAT"" </i></p>
<p><i>""Why did you do that to meeeee? PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD TELL ME THERE WILL BE A SEQUEL.""</i></p>
<p>These are actual quotes from just two of my beta readers, and if that isn't an impact I do not know what is! With your support, I can share this novel with the world and together we can watch as the world descends into madness.</p>
<p>But on a (only slightly) serious note, these reactions show that my six years of work on this novel, between college classes and AmeriCorps and paid disaster deployments, has not been in vain. It also helps show that I may not only be a contender in the apocalyptic-fiction genre, but also hopefully influence the genre as a whole.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As I mentioned before, I am a man of honesty. And while I am not quite living paycheck to paycheck, I no longer have the funds to pay for the editing service entirely by myself. I had funds set aside when it was sent off to the editor earlier in the summer, but due to circumstances outside of anyone's control it was delayed and as such those funds had to be used on other expenses.</p>
<p>Thus, this IndieGoGo campaign. Even if I do not raise a single dollar in this campaign <i>Amongst the Rubble</i> will still be published; however, instead of a December 2018 release, it will be pushed back indefinitely until finances stabilize a bit more.</p>
<p>And even if I raise all the money in the world, I still face the greatest challenge of any new author: nobody knows who Carl is.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I have spent the last year or so self-advertising on my social media platforms, and as a result have gotten a rather cult following. These Rubble Walkers (some of y'all are reading this) frequently ask for updates on my novel's release, and are all but throwing pre-orders through my window (simply because they're not available yet). So, while I am a rather unknown author, I have a small following online who have already expressed their support for my novel. And once they read it, I have no doubt that word of their experience will spread and garner more and more readers and fans.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sometimes you like a cause or project with all your heart, but you cannot financially support it yourself. We've all been there. However, even if you cannot throw a few dollars into the campaign, sharing it on social media is a fantastic way to support not only this campaign, but my novel release in general!</p>
<p>You can check out my official Tumblr page at:  carl-mckay-official.tumblr.com. This is where any and all official updates will be posted regarding my novels. This is also the best way to send any questions, comments or concerns, especially after the campaign ends.</p>
</div><p> </p><p>Thanks all y'all for reading and supporting this campaign. I know with your help, together we can make this an apocalypse worth remembering!</p></div>","Who is Carl, and what makes Amongst the Rubble so different? 
Howdy Y'all!
My name is Carl McKay, author and resident DADPAT expert based out of the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. Raised an Army Brat where I traveled the world, you could say I've had no shortage of adventure. I have a Bachelor's of Science in Homeland Security from Eastern Kentucky University, and did two years with two AmeriCorps Disaster Response Teams. Tapping into this unique background, I hope to bring a fresh taste and sense of realism to my novels.
I have read my fair share of novels in the apocalyptic genre and noticed that a lot of them- especially a lot of the successful ones- all give the reader the same indescribable feeling, and many follow the same general template. My goal is to write a novel that not only stands out in an over-saturated genre, but also leave the reader with a describable feeling and leaves the reader on the edge of their seat, not knowing what will happen next. The feedback I have received from beta readers tells me that this goal has been accomplished; now I want to share it with all y'all!
The novel is six years in the making, from the dream that inspired it to sending it to my editor a couple months back. It has gone through rigorous rewrites and changes to make it the best-possible telling of the characters' experience as I can.
This all said, I am seeking help from courageous and adventurous Rubble Walkers such as yourself to make this dream come true. While I am self-publishing, there are still costs associated with getting a book published- if you want to do it right that is. I am asking for the campaign minimum help me complete the editing process that my novel- and my fans- deserve.
While I have the campaign set for 60 days, the sooner the goal is reached, the sooner I can wrap up the process and get it published in time for this holiday season!

<p>In 2008 when canvassing for then Senator Obama in North St. Louis, there were several canvassers who were not familiar with the community. They were <strong>stunned</strong> with what they saw.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We are a community of young and emerging writers and artists from a variety of marginalized, silenced, and invisible backgrounds and experiences, especially POC, colonized and neocolonized artists. We create work that, in one way or another, challenges definitions of genre, form, theme and presentation. Our mission is to create a platform for creators like us throughout the world, to amplify our voices and throw light on our lived experiences while also forcing open the doors to new and unseen artistic modes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>For the past year this has been a labor of love, with our small forces working for free and providing the necessary funding out of pocket. In order to go forward, we need to reach out for the generosity of our extraordinary readers and viewers. Contributions will go to the costs of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Site building and maintenance including web editing services, domain, and email</li>
<li>Compensating our small, dedicated team of editors, designers, content managers, and social media personnel</li>
<li>Hopefully beginning to provide compensation to our gifted and deserving content contributors</li>
<li>Being able to hold events like art exhibits and poetry and spoken word readings when it is covid-safe</li>
<li>Ultimately creating an independent press for radical and avant-garde poets and authors from specially oppressed communities</li>
<li>Broadening our reach to be able to provide this platform to artists across the widest space possible.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Already we have been able to showcase artists from throughout the country and the world, including numerous contributors from Nigeria, where the people are currently undergoing their heroic struggle to #EndSARS. By continuing to build, we can not only have an impact on mass understanding of the expressions of these communities, but also push forward the growth of experimental and avant-garde arts by broadening their cultural parameters. If there has ever been a time when these things are even more vitally important than ever before, we are living in it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>We are attempting to be heard in the midst of the loud cacophony of the digital age, where there is extreme competition for space and the ones who monopolize and exploit the Earth's resources have the greatest access to it, to the exclusion of folk artists, the grassroots, and ordinary life. In order to make our mission viable, it must be done in the same way that we liberate ourselves: democratically, popularly, through the active collaboration of all of us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please spread the word as far and as wide as you can, let your friends, neighbors, family members, loved ones, colleagues and communities of artists know what we are trying to do, and let them know that we are in equal need of both talent and resources. If you want to be part of it, we want you here.</p>

<p>Hello all! My name is Malachi Bailey and I am a newly-minted author! Woot woot, lol. Last June, I released my debut novel, HER, which has changed my life! I’ve always been a storyteller, bookworm, and nerd from as far back as I can remember. I am unapologetic and unwavering in these interests! After much thought, I decided to re-release the book. New cover and more editing was needed to properly convey this story. I want to do it justice and give it the respect it deserves. And if you find it in your heart (and wallets) to help me achieve this dream re-tweaked, then I would be forever in your debt!<br/><br/>I’ve started the process of looking for the perfect editor to help make HER rise to stardom! But as you may or may not know editors do NOT work on hopes and dreams. They need the “green stuff”. A substantial sum of it too! Frankly, I don’t have it. I’m a “struggling artist”. And once the book is properly edited and packaged I can share it with the world again. This time without lingering doubts.</p>
<p><br/>Now here’s what YOU get in return!<br/>• $25 donation = FREE digital copy of HER<br/>• $50 donation = your name in the Acknowledgements<br/>• $100 = You make a cameo in the HER sequel</p>
<p><br/>But guess what? The rewards are cumulative! So if you crank out $175 you get ALL the perks! Cue happy dance and tears of joy!</p>
<p><br/>Seriously though, I realize what I’m asking. I’m asking for your trust and belief in me. I’m asking for a donation to help me achieve a dream I long denied for years. It was not easy birthing this dream of mine. I had to overcome so much. Self-publishing also brought its own set of challenges. In spite of it all, I remain humble, excited, and grateful that you’ve read all of this. I promise you I will not let you down. So, do it for me. Do it for HER.</p>
<p>Still with me? GREAT.  Please please pretty please share this campaign on whatever social media platform you use. Tell your mama. Tell your friends! Let them know that Indiegogo is making this possible! Thanks for your time!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: justify;"">Descripción del proyecto</h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">¿También estás hasta las narices de que jueguen contigo y tus amores parezcan de telenovela? Entonces aporta tu granito para la publicación de mi cuarto libro, dedicado a romper esa dinámica y liberarse de fachadas...</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>¡Transforma tu vida sentimental a través de la honestidad!</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mi nombre es Sergio Melich, y he dedicado los últimos cinco años de mi vida a un proyecto de desarrollo personal que hace énfasis en la identidad y las relaciones. <i></i><a href=""http://lavidaesfluir.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">La Vida es Fluir</a> es el nombre. A través del mismo he organizado distintos programas y servicios (como Alquimia Interior), que han cambiado mi vida por completo y la siguen cambiando con cada nuevo participante.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Esta campaña será para publicar un libro, que llamaré <i>Todo, menos marear</i>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Este libro nació cuando alguien me hizo llegar una imagen con la frase ""hazme lo que quieras, menos perder el tiempo"". Tuvo tanto eco en nosotros que la comentamos, y me animé a preguntarle a un montón de personas por lo que les gusta y no les gusta que pase cuando intiman con alguien.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sorprendentemente, fue mi tía paterna la que me dijo la frase que da
título al libro diciendo ""ay nene, a mí me gusta todo menos marear"".</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">De ahí para delante, he puesto esta idea como condimento en todas las relaciones y contactos que mantengo... Y gloria bendita, oye. Así las cosas, no pude resistirme a compartirlo en forma de un texto ligero, fácil de leer y todavía más fácil de aplicar. Una apuesta segura.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Te dejo con el vídeo promocional del taller con el que desarrollé plenamente el guión y los contenidos de <i>Todo, menos marear</i> (¡el más reciente!):</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FEtlE9XfAXPY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DEtlE9XfAXPY&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FEtlE9XfAXPY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>Decide ahora y vive hoy una mejor vida sentimental.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">En esta obra le damos un repasito desenfadado a la evolución de las
relaciones amorosas hasta lo que son hoy... ¡Ese dulce caos tan sabroso y tocapelotas! </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Todos nosotros hemos pensado alguna vez <em>¿quién me mandaría a mí fijarme en esa persona? </em>-- ¡y con razón! Todos hemos sentido que nos estaban manipulando, que nos hacían el enredo del siglo y no nos veíamos con herramientas, ni con fuerzas para salir de esta situación...</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Ahora, todo eso se acabó. Este libro (producto de mis experiencias y de las de mis clientes y amistades) será tu gran arma secreta para no comerte los zarzales y los pedregales que te aparezcan al paso... ¡Sin dejar de avanzar en tu vida!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Por el camino, descubrimos la importancia de tener las cosas claras. Y por supuesto, practicamos juntos maneras para ello, y también distintas formas de ser claro con los demás. No es que por tu cuenta no lo hagas, pero lo más probable es que (como todos, yo incluido) pases un montón de cosas importantes por alto... Tan sólo porque no se te ocurren, o bien porque no te las planteas con bastante profundidad. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Para solucionarlo, en este libro aparecen tres cuestiones. A saber...</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">La primera es el enfoque de exposición de alternativas, sin empujarte a escoger ninguna en especial. La segunda es el compendio de actividades para conocerte mejor y expresar partes de tu identidad que no tengan suficiente protagonismo en tu vida. Y la tercera es el programa de 10 semanas al final del libro, que nos hará la vida más sencilla y deliciosa... Con ejercicios para poner en práctica (sin farsas ni pajas mentales) todo lo que te cuenta el libro, y contando además con una comunidad para respaldarte con ello.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sólo comparto lo más auténtico, positivo y natural que conozco, por principios.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Compruébalo con <a href=""http://www.playitsexy.com/como-salir-de-uno-mismo-para-disfrutar-el-momento/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">esta muestra del manuscrito</a> que he colgado en mi web. Si te gusta, recuerda: hay más y mejor en el tintero...</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong>¡Haz conexiones profundas y disfruta de todas tus relaciones!</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A lo largo del texto se te anima a encontrar tu proporción única de matices, para darle el mejor sabor a tus experiencias. Además, y como en todos mis proyectos, hacemos esto desde la expresión auténtica de uno mismo.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Desde la libertad y el poder que suponen la honestidad, el ser abiertos y el variar el equilibrio entre ser directos o sutiles, lanzados o tímidos, etc. Tanto da si quieres casarte y tener hijos, ser <em>single </em>y vivir la vida loca, o cualquier cosa entre medio y fuera de estos cauces... Conoce, pon en práctica y disfruta de los resultados.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">... Y despídete de los mareos. ¡Así de sencillo! ;)</p>

¿También estás hasta las narices de que jueguen contigo y tus amores parezcan de telenovela? Entonces aporta tu granito para la publicación de mi cuarto libro, dedicado a romper esa dinámica y liberarse de fachadas...
¡Transforma tu vida sentimental a través de la honestidad!
Mi nombre es Sergio Melich, y he dedicado los últimos cinco años de mi vida a un proyecto de desarrollo personal que hace énfasis en la identidad y las relaciones. La Vida es Fluir es el nombre. A través del mismo he organizado distintos programas y servicios (como Alquimia Interior), que han cambiado mi vida por completo y la siguen cambiando con cada nuevo participante.
Esta campaña será para publicar un libro, que llamaré Todo, menos marear.
Este libro nació cuando alguien me hizo llegar una imagen con la frase ""hazme lo que quieras, menos perder el tiempo"". Tuvo tanto eco en nosotros que la comentamos, y me animé a preguntarle a un montón de personas por lo que les gusta y no les gusta que pase cuando intiman con alguien.
Sorprendentemente, fue mi tía paterna la que me dijo la frase que da
título al libro diciendo ""ay nene, a mí me gusta todo menos marear"".
De ahí para delante, he puesto esta idea como condimento en todas las relaciones y contactos que mantengo... Y gloria bendita, oye. Así las cosas, no pude resistirme a compartirlo en forma de un texto ligero, fácil de leer y todavía más fácil de aplicar. Una apuesta segura.
Te dejo con el vídeo promocional del taller con el que desarrollé plenamente el guión y los contenidos de Todo, menos marear (¡el más reciente!):

Decide ahora y vive hoy una mejor vida sentimental.
En esta obra le damos un repasito desenfadado a la evolución de las
relaciones amorosas hasta lo que son hoy... ¡Ese dulce caos tan sabroso y tocapelotas! Todos nosotros hemos pensado alguna vez ¿quién me mandaría a mí fijarme en esa persona? -- ¡y con razón! Todos hemos sentido que nos estaban manipulando, que nos hacían el enredo del siglo y no nos veíamos con herramientas, ni con fuerzas para salir de esta situación...
Ahora, todo eso se acabó. Este libro (producto de mis experiencias y de las de mis clientes y amistades) será tu gran arma secreta para no comerte los zarzales y los pedregales que te aparezcan al paso... ¡Sin dejar de avanzar en tu vida!
Por el camino, descubrimos la importancia de tener las cosas claras. Y por supuesto, practicamos juntos maneras para ello, y también distintas formas de ser claro con los demás. No es que por tu cuenta no lo hagas, pero lo más probable es que (como todos, yo incluido) pases un montón de cosas importantes por alto... Tan sólo porque no se te ocurren, o bien porque no te las planteas con bastante profundidad. Para solucionarlo, en este libro aparecen tres cuestiones. A saber...La primera es el enfoque de exposición de alternativas, sin empujarte a escoger ninguna en especial. La segunda es el compendio de actividades para conocerte mejor y expresar partes de tu identidad que no tengan suficiente protagonismo en tu vida. Y la tercera es el programa de 10 semanas al final del libro, que nos hará la vida más sencilla y deliciosa... Con ejercicios para poner en práctica (sin farsas ni pajas mentales) todo lo que te cuenta el libro, y contando además con una comunidad para respaldarte con ello.Sólo comparto lo más auténtico, positivo y natural que conozco, por principios.
Compruébalo con esta muestra del manuscrito que he colgado en mi web. Si te gusta, recuerda: hay más y mejor en el tintero...
¡Haz conexiones profundas y disfruta de todas tus relaciones!
A lo largo del texto se te anima a encontrar tu proporción única de matices, para darle el mejor sabor a tus experiencias. Además, y como en todos mis proyectos, hacemos esto desde la expresión auténtica de uno mismo.
Desde la libertad y el poder que suponen la honestidad, el ser abiertos y el variar el equilibrio entre ser directos o sutiles, lanzados o tímidos, etc. Tanto da si quieres casarte y tener hijos, ser single y vivir la vida loca, o cualquier cosa entre medio y fuera de estos cauces... Conoce, pon en práctica y disfruta de los resultados.
... Y despídete de los mareos. ¡Así de sencillo! ;)

LAS APORTACIONES Y A QUÉ SE DESTINAN
Para que quede claro, pues algunas personas ignoran completamente los lados de las webs que leen para evitar la publicidad... Colocaré aquí las distintas cantidades (que figuran también a la derecha de la página, junto a estas palabras) y las recompensas que obtienes a cambio de cada una.
De menor a mayor, son estas (nótese que son acumulativas):


Un café para el autor. (2€) — ¡Tu nombre aparecerá en los agradecimientos del libro y de la web!


¡A la vanguardia! (6€) — Recibirás una copia digital antes de la salida definitiva del libro.

Una copia firmada, por favor. (17€) — Una copia impresa firmada en tu nombre o en el de quien tú quieras, tras publicar el libro. Gastos de envío incluidos para la península ibérica.

De dos en dos me gusta más... (25€) — Pues que sean dos copias impresas, firmadas en tu nombre o en el de quien tú quieras, tras publicar el libro.

Codo con codo. (48€) — Una copia impresa firmada en tu nombre o en el de quien tú quieras, tras publicar el libro; además de Seguimiento personalizado durante las 10 semanas del programa que incluye el libro. Gastos de envío incluidos para la península ibérica.

Debemos aplicar... (100€) — Una invitación gratuita a un taller en vivo, o plaza gratis en el seminario online. Tres copias del libro firmadas en tu nombre o en el de quien tú quieras, tras publicar el libro.

Aventura: rumbo al horizonte. (250€) — Te invito a una experiencia de retiro en vivo conmigo. Tú corres con tus propios gastos, por supuesto, pero piensa en ello como una aventura para el cambio. :)

Sólo para Sponsors. (400€) — Además de una mención especial como Sponsor en el libro y la web, tendrás una plaza gratuita en cualquier evento y programa que organice, y contaré contigo como beta-tester.

¡Vamos a por todas! (1200€) — ¿Quieres patrocinar el proyecto entero? ¡Excelente, camarada! Además de todo lo anterior, ¡¡tienes un año de mentoring personal conmigo!! Sesiones en vivo y telemáticas (Skype, Hangouts, etc.) a convenir. Y el logotipo de tu empresa o proyecto aparecerá en el libro y en la web, acreditado como patrocinador.
Como estos proyectos pueden llegar a recaudar más de lo previsto inicialmente, os cuento en detalle lo que se hará cuando alcancemos ciertos montos. Todas las cifras han sido calculadas usando las tarifas de la Editorial Círculo Rojo como referencia, puesto que lo editarán ellos.


Hitos de publicación: Estas cantidades reflejan el presupuesto que ha realizado para esta obra la editorial, y distintos servicios extra que se suman a una mayor cantidad de ejemplares impresos. Yo asumiré los gastos de envío para los mecenas que residan en el territorio peninsular de España (para envíos al extranjero y fuera de la península: por favor, añadid 10 euros al hacer la donación).


A partir de los hitos: Todo lo que supere la cantidad de 925 €uros lo usaremos para cubrir gastos de envío (en caso necesario) y contratar servicios de traducción. Si sobrara todavía más, se dedicará al bonus de la escapada de aventura.

CALENDARIO
¡La obra está casi en tus manos! Los lectores beta han quedado encantados, las lectoras beta se están planteando regalárselo a varios chicos que conocen (cosa que me halaga y me hace gracia al mismo tiempo).
Se tomaron en cuenta las aportaciones y todos los comentarios de ellas y de ellos para revisar el manuscrito, que ya está terminado (para asegurar la calidad,  suelo dejar reposar lo que escribí, y lo reviso no menos de tres veces).
Y este es el calendario detallado de las acciones que se han realizado hasta ahora, además de fechas orientativas para la entrega de recompensas.
Tenemos que tener en cuenta el plazo de trabajo de la editorial (que consta de entre 30 y 35 días hábiles a partir de la firma del contrato de edición). He aceptado el presupuesto que os he reflejado arriba, y cerraré el contrato en este mes de julio si alcanzamos como mínimo el primero de los tres hitos.
La entrega de las recompensas por aportación puede comenzar prácticamente en cuanto el proceso editorial esté terminado y reciba los ejemplares a firmar.
En el caso de que tu recompensa incluya una copia digital anticipada (o una participación en los programas y servicios que ofrece el equipo); mantente al tanto. Contactaremos contigo para ultimar los detalles que sean precisos.
 
Riesgos y desafíos
Las campañas de este tipo pueden fallar y no alcanzar su objetivo.
De hecho, en Verkami (otra web de crowdfunding catalana que opera desde España) esta misma campaña logró reunir aportes por valor de 571 €uros, con solamente 12 mecenas aportándole. Esta es una segunda oportunidad para llegar a la meta propuesta.
Los mayores obstáculos que enfrenta este proyecto son, sin embargo, las convenciones sociales y culturales que nos impiden llevar una vida sentimental más sencilla, natural y amena... Si bien eso es algo que se enfrenta con la consciencia, el conocimiento de causa y reforzando el poder de tomar decisiones en base a la propia identidad, necesidades y deseos.

Para solucionar esto, varias de las aportaciones incluyen plazas en los distintos servicios que ofrece el equipo (talleres presenciales, seminarios online, asesorías, etc.) como refuerzo para los cambios que inicies. Además, en el caso de quienes adquieran el seminario y los talleres, un/a acompañante puede unirse sin costes añadidos.
También destacaría como desafío el colaborar con una editorial externa en vez de seguir recurriendo a la autoedición (como ya hice con otros tres libros anteriormente, que se pueden encontrar en Amazon). No pongo en duda la calidad de su trabajo, pero no podré responder por los plazos del mismo salvo en la medida que ellos mismos se comprometan.

Mi plan es contar con vosotros (los interesados de todo el mundo) y con una editorial a la que vender mi libro le aporte beneficios significativos para sacar este proyecto adelante... Pura filosofía ganar-ganar.
Amazon puede venderlos, pero dudo que saque un 0,00001% de su beneficio total con ellos. Por ello deseo acudir a una editorial con la que al menos un amigo ha trabajado ya, y está satisfecho del resultado. ¿Y sobre enviaros el libro firmado, como prometen las recompensas? El envío debería estar cubierto si alcanzamos la cantidad objetivo, al menos dentro de España.

<p>Hi! My name is Anne Connolly and I have been an artist and a teller of stories from the moment I first picked up a crayon! Over the past 30 years I have also tried to inspire students of all ages to work hard, be good and feel strong through the martial art of Tae kwon do. I care deeply about how students learn and I frequently use my artistic and creative skills when I teach. Here's a photo of one of the paintings I made of a giant, life-size prehistoric mammal, so that students could experience just how big the animals were when we cover prehistoric life in Tae kwon do camp. <br/></p>

Hi! My name is Anne Connolly and I have been an artist and a teller of stories from the moment I first picked up a crayon! Over the past 30 years I have also tried to inspire students of all ages to work hard, be good and feel strong through the martial art of Tae kwon do. I care deeply about how students learn and I frequently use my artistic and creative skills when I teach. Here's a photo of one of the paintings I made of a giant, life-size prehistoric mammal, so that students could experience just how big the animals were when we cover prehistoric life in Tae kwon do camp. 


I have spent my whole adult life trying to help people. Now, I am combining my desire to contribute to the world we live in, with my love of art, literature and education, to create a great series of books to help children learn and educators teach. These entertaining books feature:

beautiful illustrations
great stories
endearing characters

 a different academic, early language lesson is embedded very cleverly in each story
and, because the heart is as important as the mind, each story has a positive message!
Friend me on face book ( https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1000014... ) for updates on how to get the most educational value from each book, background information on each story, when and where I'll be reading the books, the status on publishing and delivery dates, and to help decide which book-cover art we should use and more!

THESE BOOKS ARE AVAILABLE IN RICH, FULL COLOR OR IN BLACK AND WHITE   AS THE BEST COLORING BOOKS EVER!The black & white editions are:Beautiful hard cover books

The Illustrations are already shaded for you so you can just add the color and they'll look great
Come with a place for you to sign your name as the colorist next to the author's, to personalize your contribution to the book
When you are done you you have a beautiful quality book for your library or as a unique and very personal gift for a child or teacher you love (not just a coloring book that you colored)
All the illustrations in the full color editions are done with crayola pencils, so you don't need fancy, expensive pencils to make beautiful colors!
FRIEND ME ON FACE BOOK to find out about  things like when, tips on coloring videos etc. will be available to watch and more. 


IN BLACK & WHITE, GRAB YOUR BOX OF COLORED PENCILS AND GET TO WORK!OR READ AND ENJOY THE BOOKS IN RICH, FULL COLOR! Now that you've discovered these great new books,  share your discovery! EVERYONE LOVES A GOOD STORY! SHARE THE ART! POSITIVE MESSAGES! EDUCATIONAL MERIT and of course, THAT THE BOOKS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE AS THE BEST COLORING BOOKS EVER!
 When you buy a book you'll be contributing to the
cost of formatting and scanning the books for printing
cost of printing the books
the computer program (photo-shop or indesign ) to add the text to the illustrations
the cost of delivering your books to you
The time frame
We have 60 days to raise the capital  

It takes about a week to produce the proofs
If the proofs are awesome it takes about 5 weeks to print the books
Then, we pack the books up and deliver them (This depends on how many books we are shipping, but I'll have lot's of help!)
That's if everything happens on schedule, I'll keep you updated on face book (Anne Connolly) if we fall behind or get ahead!

If we exceed the funding goal, you'll be supporting new books with awesome stories, beautiful illustrations, positive messages and cleverly embedded educational lessons for children and teachers to enjoy! (Several more stories are already written and  are in the sketchbook design phase) Here are some sketches for a funny story in the design phase, about a herd of hiding Hs!




If we don't meet the funding goal, you'll still receive your books on schedule 
 BOOK COVER ART FOR THE FIRST 4 BOOKS IN THE SERIES

All the illustrations for the first three books are finished (1st book. The Small Shy S Who Changed the World, 2nd book. Eeeevolve! 3rd book.The Good Llittle G)All the illustrations for the forth book, X-Quest! are complete as line drawings but need to be shaded and colored. I'm going to try and have the 4th book finished by the end of the fund raiser but it might take a little longer. Because you may have to wait a little longer for X-Quest!, everyone who orders all 4 books will receive a free poster.

REMEMBER, EVERYONE LOVES A GOOD BOOK! SHARE YOU DISCOVERY!SUPPORT THE SERIES AND WATCH IT GROW IN FULL COLOR AND AS GREAT COLORING BOOKS!SPREAD THE WORD AND ENJOY YOUR BOOKS!!! THANKS! Anne Connolly's awesome books available at www.indiegogo.com",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></span></p><p>A book written by myself (Valeriy Gristiv) and a
professional ghostwriter about my Granny, Etcia Goldberg - a Ukrainian woman
who lived in a deep underground cave (Popowa Yama) for 344 days protecting her
three young children during the Holocaust<b>.  </b>It is also a love story that shares
my Granny’s relationship with a Ukrainian shoemaker named Josef, who hid Jewish families on
his property during the war.</p>
<p>Help us share Etcia Goldberg’s remarkable story about
heroism, survival and woman’s empowerment that demonstrates that no matter how
bad the circumstances there is always a way out. </p>
<p></p>
<p>My name is Valeriy
Gristiv. As a young boy growing up in Borszcow, Ukraine half a century ago; my
grandmother told me stories about what it meant to be Jewish in our country.
She explained to me what it was like to hide in a cave 70 feet underground with
my Momma, Mania; my uncles<b>, </b>Dunia
and Marek, and four other large families during the Holocaust.</p>
<p>When my Granny told me these stories she said they
never thought the world would believe the things that they did to survive. I am
writing this book now because the world is now ready to hear it. </p>
<p>We are writing the story as a novel based on a true
story to protect some of the characters identities; and to fill in some of the
details of the cave experience shared by my Grandmother throughout my
childhood, and by my Mother and uncles and other relatives when they were
interviewed earlier the year for this book.  We feel an urgency to publish it now
while my Mother and uncles are still alive to read it.</p>

<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b>As I climb down the rungs of
rock wall into the cave, the dawn light disappears from above me. I hold under
my armpit the tattered bag of food and supplies I secured in the village, and
finally let out my breath. </b></p>
<p><b>My legs are still slightly
swollen from walking and running through the night. Relief spreads over my body
and I leave it behind---the world above ground which has gone so crazy it is
unrecognizable—where I may be welcomed to somebody’s table one minute, and have
a gun pointed at my head the next.  I
descend deeper into the fetid darkness, yearning for the love of my children, the
only thing that makes any sense. </b></p>
<p><b>It is true that we live as the
dead do, sealed so deep under the ground. Our bodies are part of the earth. In
this deep cavern where the light has been snuffed out, we are free. They do not
believe we exist here. And so we are left alone in peace. </b></p>
<p><b>I wind quickly down the
corridors, counting my footsteps, feeling for rock walls like a blind woman. I
hold the lantern up when I reach our living quarters and turn it on. My
children are curled around each other under the dirty sheep skin blanket. For a
brief second, they look more animal than human, small lumps of fur in a giant
nest. </b></p>
<p><b>Marek sees me first and bolts
up. Dunia and Mania turn slowly, their small eyes squinting. I place the bag of
supplies on the rock table we made, collapse on the bed and open my arms. </b></p>
<p><b>They surround me, their chilled
skin pressed against my sides. I squeeze them, breathing in their sourness;
touching clumped hair, one small sticky hand gripping my thumb. My heartbeat is
so loud, I am sure they can hear it. I remind myself that I am back home now,
that my children are safe. </b></p>
<p><b>It sometimes takes me a long
time both to readjust to the darkness, and to convince my body that we are all
together again, that we still draw our breath. </b></p>
<p><b>Marek is the only one who still
sobs when I return.  “We thought you
weren’t coming back,” he says. Down here, we choose our words carefully. Marek
is my baby. He is only seven years old but his words have the weight of heavy
stone in a river. If I do not come back, he believes that nobody will take care
of him or his siblings, that it is possible they will no longer be able to eat.</b></p>
<p><b>“Shhh,” says Mania, my 15-year-old
daughter.  She reaches for her youngest
brother, trying to take some of the burden from me.  I am reminded how much I worry for Mania. The
women in my family all developed early: our full breasts and thighs a staple of
our clan. Manias body is still prepubescent, her chest is flat and she is
lanky, all hips and elbows and knees. I worry that her body will never mature;
that she will never fall in love or raise her own family. At the same time, her
eyes are lackluster, the eyes of an old woman who has seen too much and have
stopped looking too far. In the cave, my Mania cannot dream like a girl. </b></p>
<p><b>I switch the lantern off. A
deep shame burns in me. It is as if Mania knows. I visited Josef last night in
his shoemakers shop, accepted the best bits of food that he had to give, even a
jar of pickled carrots from his summer house. I was surprised by the way he appreciated
me, despite the stench of my rotting tooth, my flesh that is fast turning to
bone. When he touched my forehead, lightly, ignoring the grime I was sure I had
not been able to wash in the latrine, I did not pull away. I have no right to
be comforted like a woman when it is possible my daughter may not even live
long enough to start menstruating.</b></p>
<p><b>I cannot afford to think this
way.  We must survive. </b></p>
<p><b>“I will always come back for
you,” I say. It is a prayer I tell them every few weeks when I leave the cave
in my trousers to go beg or steal.</b></p>
<p><b>Sleep will come too easily.  The exhaustion is more urgent than hunger,
than thirst. Our room down here is a sanctuary but it is also a trap. There is
so much room here to walk around, unburdened by the terrors that haunt us above
ground. At the same time the darkness has become somewhat of an infatuation, the
way that we sleep through hunger and cold, lulling ourselves into a false sense
of safety.</b></p>
<p><b>They know not to ask about food
until morning, when it is our families turn again at the stove. I didn’t get as
much food this time--some potatoes, grain, the carrots pickled in brine, we
will have to eat less for longer.  I pull
Marek onto my lap and prop myself up on the bed. Mania and Dunia gather at my
sides. Mania touches my hair shyly, perhaps feeling in it the cool air of the night.
She presses her lips to my cheek. They are eager for stories, my babies; they are
anxious to know what the world is like aboveground. They want me to tell them fairytales
about our family; about horses, and starlight and gardens.</b></p>

<p></p>
<p><b><u><br/></u></b></p><p><b><u>THE TOP FIVE REASONS YOU MIGHT CHOOSE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS CAMPAIGN:</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>1. <u>Survival: </u>Anyone who has faced a tough challenge
in life can benefit from this book. The cave dwellers lived in the dark and
cold 70 feet underground, and learned ways to keep their bodies and minds
active and alive despite the most extraordinary circumstances. </p>
<p>2.
<u>Gratitude:  </u>My Grandmother’s story

<p></p><p></p></div>","A book written by myself (Valeriy Gristiv) and a
professional ghostwriter about my Granny, Etcia Goldberg - a Ukrainian woman
who lived in a deep underground cave (Popowa Yama) for 344 days protecting her
three young children during the Holocaust.  It is also a love story that shares
my Granny’s relationship with a Ukrainian shoemaker named Josef, who hid Jewish families on
his property during the war.
Help us share Etcia Goldberg’s remarkable story about
heroism, survival and woman’s empowerment that demonstrates that no matter how
bad the circumstances there is always a way out. 

My name is Valeriy
Gristiv. As a young boy growing up in Borszcow, Ukraine half a century ago; my
grandmother told me stories about what it meant to be Jewish in our country.
She explained to me what it was like to hide in a cave 70 feet underground with
my Momma, Mania; my uncles, Dunia
and Marek, and four other large families during the Holocaust.
When my Granny told me these stories she said they
never thought the world would believe the things that they did to survive. I am
writing this book now because the world is now ready to hear it. 
We are writing the story as a novel based on a true
story to protect some of the characters identities; and to fill in some of the
details of the cave experience shared by my Grandmother throughout my
childhood, and by my Mother and uncles and other relatives when they were
interviewed earlier the year for this book.  We feel an urgency to publish it now
while my Mother and uncles are still alive to read it.

SAMPLES OF THE BOOK:

As I climb down the rungs of
rock wall into the cave, the dawn light disappears from above me. I hold under
my armpit the tattered bag of food and supplies I secured in the village, and
finally let out my breath. 
My legs are still slightly
swollen from walking and running through the night. Relief spreads over my body
and I leave it behind---the world above ground which has gone so crazy it is
unrecognizable—where I may be welcomed to somebody’s table one minute, and have
a gun pointed at my head the next.  I
descend deeper into the fetid darkness, yearning for the love of my children, the
only thing that makes any sense. 
It is true that we live as the
dead do, sealed so deep under the ground. Our bodies are part of the earth. In
this deep cavern where the light has been snuffed out, we are free. They do not
believe we exist here. And so we are left alone in peace. 
I wind quickly down the
corridors, counting my footsteps, feeling for rock walls like a blind woman. I
hold the lantern up when I reach our living quarters and turn it on. My
children are curled around each other under the dirty sheep skin blanket. For a
brief second, they look more animal than human, small lumps of fur in a giant
nest. 
Marek sees me first and bolts
up. Dunia and Mania turn slowly, their small eyes squinting. I place the bag of
supplies on the rock table we made, collapse on the bed and open my arms. 
They surround me, their chilled
skin pressed against my sides. I squeeze them, breathing in their sourness;
touching clumped hair, one small sticky hand gripping my thumb. My heartbeat is
so loud, I am sure they can hear it. I remind myself that I am back home now,
that my children are safe. 
It sometimes takes me a long
time both to readjust to the darkness, and to convince my body that we are all
together again, that we still draw our breath. 
Marek is the only one who still
sobs when I return.  “We thought you
weren’t coming back,” he says. Down here, we choose our words carefully. Marek
is my baby. He is only seven years old but his words have the weight of heavy
stone in a river. If I do not come back, he believes that nobody will take care
of him or his siblings, that it is possible they will no longer be able to eat.
“Shhh,” says Mania, my 15-year-old
daughter.  She reaches for her youngest
brother, trying to take some of the burden from me.  I am reminded how much I worry for Mania. The
women in my family all developed early: our full breasts and thighs a staple of
our clan. Manias body is still prepubescent, her chest is flat and she is
lanky, all hips and elbows and knees. I worry that her body will never mature;
that she will never fall in love or raise her own family. At the same time, her
eyes are lackluster, the eyes of an old woman who has seen too much and have
stopped looking too far. In the cave, my Mania cannot dream like a girl. 
I switch the lantern off. A
deep shame burns in me. It is as if Mania knows. I visited Josef last night in
his shoemakers shop, accepted the best bits of food that he had to give, even a
jar of pickled carrots from his summer house. I was surprised by the way he appreciated
me, despite the stench of my rotting tooth, my flesh that is fast turning to
bone. When he touched my forehead, lightly, ignoring the grime I was sure I had
not been able to wash in the latrine, I did not pull away. I have no right to
be comforted like a woman when it is possible my daughter may not even live
long enough to start menstruating.
I cannot afford to think this
way.  We must survive. 
“I will always come back for
you,” I say. It is a prayer I tell them every few weeks when I leave the cave
in my trousers to go beg or steal.
Sleep will come too easily.  The exhaustion is more urgent than hunger,
than thirst. Our room down here is a sanctuary but it is also a trap. There is
so much room here to walk around, unburdened by the terrors that haunt us above
ground. At the same time the darkness has become somewhat of an infatuation, the
way that we sleep through hunger and cold, lulling ourselves into a false sense
of safety.
They know not to ask about food
until morning, when it is our families turn again at the stove. I didn’t get as
much food this time--some potatoes, grain, the carrots pickled in brine, we
will have to eat less for longer.  I pull
Marek onto my lap and prop myself up on the bed. Mania and Dunia gather at my
sides. Mania touches my hair shyly, perhaps feeling in it the cool air of the night.
She presses her lips to my cheek. They are eager for stories, my babies; they are
anxious to know what the world is like aboveground. They want me to tell them fairytales
about our family; about horses, and starlight and gardens.


THE TOP FIVE REASONS YOU MIGHT CHOOSE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS CAMPAIGN:

1. Survival: Anyone who has faced a tough challenge
in life can benefit from this book. The cave dwellers lived in the dark and
cold 70 feet underground, and learned ways to keep their bodies and minds
active and alive despite the most extraordinary circumstances. 
2.
Gratitude:  My Grandmother’s story
is peppered with the enormous gratitude she felt for all the people who helped
her family and other cave dwellers to survive during the war. Throughout my
childhood I watched my Grandmother repay this kindness to those who helped her
and to anyone she encountered.
My Granny taught me so much about
compassion, forgiveness and gratitude. We would be grateful if you would
contribute to this campaign or share this campaign with others on social media.
In return we will give you copies of the book and recognition in the book. You might also rest assured knowing that you are doing a good deed.
 I know that seeing this book through
to publication would make my Granny proud. 
3. Women’s Empowerment:  The story of some of the other survivors of
the cave was told in the documentary, The
Secret of Priests Grotto, released
in 2013. My Grandmother’s story was unique, as she was the only woman who was
head of a household in the cave and risked her life regularly alongside the men--and independently of the men--to keep
her children alive. Her story was not really shared in the film and my family
feels it is important to share it now.
Etcia’s story can serve as an example to young women today. Etcia was a
tough woman on her own who dressed in men’s clothes to disguise her identity,
didn’t back down from the most extreme challenges; and did everything within
her power to ensure her children survived. 
4. Global Knowledge:
Galicia is a territory that straddles the Eastern Part of
Poland and the Western Part of Ukraine. It is a beautiful land, characterized
by its rich chernozem soil. Jewish people lived as a minority population in
this area for 10-12 generations. They suffered throughout history under the
rule of various leaders: however, devastation related to the European Holocaust
practically annihilated the Jewish people in Galicia. My granny told stories to
her children about the history of our people, our family and this colorful land
throughout the novel. 
5. Challenges: Although we found some small publishers willing to print

my mother and uncles are still alive to read it. We are self-publishing the

Kidtropolis tells the story of a young girl that journeys to a magical place to find out where babies come from. The books main character (which is based off my daughter) has Cerebral Palsy. But, though she has inabilities, she will soon discover that she can overcome them all, if she believes.  
This is book was originally scheduled to be released in the spring; but we have changed publishers and it will now be released in the early summer to bookshelves, everywhere.


But I need your help!  

I am asking you to help me raise the funds that I need to make this book a success.  While this book will be available in bookstores everywhere; I have an opportunity for it to be published as an ebook for the Kindle, Nook, and iPad, as well.

I need to raise just $3500 to make that happen.  So I am asking you for your support.  If you would donate $10.00 to this effort, you would be helping my dream come true.  And in return for that $10.00 donation, I will send you an autographed copy of the book once it is published.

Will you help me.  I would greatly appreciate, if you would.

Thank you advance,

<p>My name is Katalin Galambos and I’ve been living in Norway for more than four years with my family consisting of two small kids. Both of my kids were born during our stay here and thus I have been lucky to experience Norway’s impressing family and child centric environment.</p>
<p><strong>Being a mum is an everyday challenge and even more in a new society with different cultural background.</strong>  In order to manage the daily operational issues with your children and settle in, you need to put much more effort in finding your way, than if you were a local.

<h3><strong>It began 3 years ago</strong></h3>
<p>Not being aware of any similar formation, after my first child was born I <strong>established an international mother group in Oslo</strong> (called IMOBAGO) to gather mums in similar situation and create a sharing and cooperation zone.</p>
<h3><strong>Road to the a book</strong></h3>
<p>Based on these mothers’ specific and custom-made questions, issues and best practices, I’ve identified the typical challenging areas for expat mothers in Oslo, grouped the relevant related information and now would like to make it available for an even larger group of mothers</p>

<li>and the ones planning to move here</li>
</ul><p>                                                   in the form of a book. </p>

<h3><strong>Funds will cover the printing costs</strong></h3>
<p>The plan now is to have <strong>~200 printed copies</strong> during the first quarter of 2013 followed by an e-book later on. The size of the printed version would be A5 which is the optimal size that can easily fit into a hand bag and be always within reach on the go.</p>

<h3>Demand that President Obama release his College Transcripts and Passport Stamps!</h3>
<p>Donald Trump has just released a video offering a deal to President Obama that if he release his college transcripts and passport stamps Trump will donate $5,000,000 to a charity of Obama's choice. I intend to raise enough money to match what Trump is offering and distribute the funds to the same charity of our Presidents choice.</p>
<p>My name is Bradley Palmer II and just like many of you for the past 4 years I have seen this country go in the wrong direction. We have 23 Million Americans out of work, your income has dropped by $4,000 a year, health insurance premiums have risen $2,500 dollars, and our country is over $16 Trillion dollars in debt. Where does this stop? Why do we have a President in office that claims to be the most transparent President in history yet refuses to release documents directly related to his eligibility to lead this country? We should demand more! We deserve better and from the pain we all have experienced over these last 4 years we need to question the man in charge. Would you allow your business or even just your checkbook to be run by an unqualified individual? My simple answer is no, but to prove he is not qualified we need your help! Donate to this cause. Should the President come through and comply with Trump we will donate the proceeds to the same charity of the President's choosing. Should he not comply with this deal we will donate to a local charity regardless of what Donald Trump does. $5,000,000 is a lot of money for Obama to not comply with. Imagine if that amount were<em><strong> $10,000,000.</strong></em>................<strong>AMERICA DESERVES TO KNOW!</strong></p>

<p>To increase the pressure on the President to release his records. Yes $5,000,000 from one man to a charity of the Presidents choosing is a lot, but $10,000,000 from thousands of individuals combined with Trumps contribution says a whole lot more!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Jonah Estess. I am a senior at the NYC iSchool in Lower Manhattan. One of the graduation requirements is to complete a project on a topic of my choice, and so I have chosen to produce an exhibit and give a formal presentation to a group of my peers. The topic I will concentrate on is the history and explanations for the existence of American Civil War tokens, which were produced by merchants in response to the massive hoarding of legal tender coinage in circulation just after the start of the Civil War. This is an extremely important project to me, not only because of its importance for my graduation, but because numismatics - the study of coins, medals, paper money, and other economy-related artifacts - is my passion and is what I hope to continue for the rest of my academic and professional careers. If you chose to contribute to this project, you will be helping me accomplish the largest academic project I have ever undertaken.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My campaign goal is to raise at least $800 to purchase all of the presentation and curatorial materials needed to produce a quality exhibit. Every bit of the money raised will go into the making of the exhibit. As a contributor, I cannot offer you money or prizes or a chance at the vacation of your life, but I will remain forever grateful for you help with my project. After I display my exhibit and orate my presentation, I will provide a full-length video of my exhibit and presentation online for anyone to see.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions are a decisive factor in the completion and effectiveness of my exhibit and presentation. I have devoted much of my life to learning about numismatics and its significance in the world today. Although I have never completed a project of this size before, I spent two and a half years of high school as an intern in the American Numismatic Society's curatorial department. Here, I worked with historians and scholars to catalogue parts of the Society's collection. I also assisted in organizing parts of the collection and working with curators to assemble pieces of the collection for their projects and other academic works. I am also experienced in organizing numismatic auctions with groups of my peers at the American Numismatic Association's annual Summer Seminar at their headquarters in Colorado Springs, CO.</p>
<p>Every contribution you make to towards my project will help me reach my ultimate goal of making numismatics, economic, and social history my profession.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't contribute to my campaign, I encourage you to check out the two organizations that I mentioned above:</p>
<p>American Numismatic Association: <a href=""http://www.money.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.money.org/</a></p>
<p>American Numismatic Society: <a href=""http://www.numismatics.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.numismatics.org/</a></p>
<p>A third organization that has contributed immensley to the study of Civil War tokens is the Civil War Token Society. Check out their website here: <a href=""http://www.cwtsociety.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.cwtsociety.com/</a></p>
<p>Both of these organizations are at the forefront of historical research, analysis, and education and are organizations to which I owe much of my devotion to the numismatic field.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about my project!</p>

<h1>Project Summary:</h1>
<p><em>US Army AWOL Defense: A Practice Guide </em>will be published in December 2012, in both print and ebook formats.</p>
<p>The book is a legal practice guide (a practical ""how-to"" book for attorneys and other legal professionals) on how to help AWOL (absent without leave) soldiers get their legal situations resolved in the best way possible. The book will include not only commentary, but also will provide sample letters, forms and other documents that could be useful in the art of AWOL defense.</p>
<p>Along with the practical elements, the book will also touch briefly on some of the historical, social, moral and legal issues related to the issue of AWOL in the US military.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<h3>Excerpt from the first draft of the book:</h3>
<p>“<em>Soldiers who desert their units are ruining their lives. They normally wind up with years of jail time, and a dishonorable discharge. In fact they are getting off easy because desertion in time of war is punishable by death!” - Statement by an unnamed basic training drill sergeant</em></p>
<p>“<em>If you want to go AWOL, go right ahead. If you don't want to be here, the Army doesn't want you. Just follow the train tracks off post. Just get the **** out of here! Hell, we'll even mail you your discharge papers.” - Statement by a different unnamed sergeant</em></p>
<p>These two statements are examples of the over-simplified rumors that members of the US Army hear on a regular basis. I've heard both of these statements (and variations on those statements) repeated by my clients, which added a great deal of confusion to an already difficult situation. I believe that it is better for soldiers to know the whole truth about how AWOL cases are handled in the Army. This book is intended to help to tell the real story.</p>

<h1>Project Goals:</h1>
<p>The first draft of the book is finished. Editing is underway with a goal of having it ready for publishing in December 2012. </p>
<p>The book will be published in 2 formats:</p>
<p>* Traditional print paperback (sold at a reasonable cost)</p>
<p>* E-book to be read on e-readers and computers (sold at a reasonable cost)</p>
<p>The book will initially be available for free digital download to active duty servicemembers in need, subject to the success of fundraising for the project.</p>
<p>The book will first be published through a POD (print on demand) service like Lulu or CreateSpace, to ensure the book gets into the hands of those in need as quickly as possible. </p>
<h1>Project Purposes:</h1>
<p>1. To provide practical information for military law practitioners (and their clients) on legal strategies used to deal with possible absence-related offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (i.e. AWOL, Desertion and Missing Movement),</p>
<p>2. To provide sample letters, forms and other documents to military law practitioners who area working with AWOL soldiers,</p>
<p>3. To provide hope and encouragement to military servicemembers who are seeking to resolve their AWOL status with the Army.</p>
<h1>Project fundraising needs:</h1>
<p>The funds raised through this kickstarter project will be used for 3 things:</p>
<p>1. To pay the author for his time in writing, editing and publishing this book</p>
<p>2. To fulfill the Kickstarter rewards</p>
<p>3. To provide free copies of the book to active duty servicemembers</p>
<p>4. For book publishing/promotion costs.</p>
<p>The Indiegogo campaign goal is the minimum amount required to publish the book. Funds raised raised beyond this minimum will help to fund additional promotion of the book, as well as future writing efforts (a second book is in the works), however, if the campaign does not reach its goal I will seek alternate funding so the book can make it to print.</p>

1. To provide practical information for military law practitioners (and their clients) on legal strategies used to deal with possible absence-related offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (i.e. AWOL, Desertion and Missing Movement),
2. To provide sample letters, forms and other documents to military law practitioners who area working with AWOL soldiers,
3. To provide hope and encouragement to military servicemembers who are seeking to resolve their AWOL status with the Army.
Project fundraising needs:
The funds raised through this kickstarter project will be used for 3 things:
1. To pay the author for his time in writing, editing and publishing this book
2. To fulfill the Kickstarter rewards
3. To provide free copies of the book to active duty servicemembers
4. For book publishing/promotion costs.
The Indiegogo campaign goal is the minimum amount required to publish the book. Funds raised raised beyond this minimum will help to fund additional promotion of the book, as well as future writing efforts (a second book is in the works), however, if the campaign does not reach its goal I will seek alternate funding so the book can make it to print.

<p>I am in the finishing stages of a book about a trip I took to Thailand to ordain as a monk and live in Buddhist temples. My friend, a Buddhist monk, had told me that he was going home to visit his family and invited me to come with him and ordain for a short period. How could I pass up that opportunity?

<h1><strong>What's Weight Hacking?</strong></h1>
<p><em>Weight Hacking</em> is a how-to book for geeks who want to lose weight and get fit, written by a geek who’s successfully lost 65lbs.</p>
<h1> </h1>
<h1>Why Are You Writing it? </h1>
<p>Like a lot of geeks, I grew up playing D&amp;D, hacking on computers, watching TV and reading a lot. And like a lot of geeks, I was overweight, rarely got exercise and ate poorly. At my heaviest I was 225lbs, and at 5’ 7” that put me squarely in the “obese” category.</p>
<p>Sometimes I tried dieting, but either it didn’t work or it didn’t work for long. I concluded that diets weren’t for me because they weren’t compatible with my geeky lifestyle.</p>
<p>So I created Weight Hacking, my own personal weight loss approach that used my geeky nature to work for me, and one that I could incorporate into my daily life. I didn’t go on a diet, I permanently changed my diet. I didn’t “get exercise,” I re-arranged my life so that I was naturally more active. And it wasn’t particularly hard.</p>
<p>Since becoming a weighthacker I’ve lost 65lbs and now weigh 159lbs, or about 29% less than I used to. To say Weight Hacking changed my life is wrong: it’s given me a new, more awesome life. I feel better. I look better. I get more done. Every single medical measure of my health has improved. You get the idea.</p>
<p>All my geeky friends keep asking me how I did it, because they want to lose weight too. That’s when I realized Weight Hacking could help lots of geeks out there, not just me. So I decided I should write a book to explain how it works, and I’m raising funds on IndieGoGo to be able to finish and publish it.</p>

<h1>  </h1>
<h1>What Makes Weight Hacking Unique?</h1>
<p><em>Weight Hacking</em> isn’t a new fad diet or some heretofore undiscovered but miraculous nutritional trick. It makes no new medical claims, and none of the science in it is in any way outlandish. In fact, all of the research referenced in Weight Hacking comes from impeccable sources like the Harvard School for Public Health and the Mayo Clinic. </p>
<p><em>Weight Hacking</em> is simply an operating system for nerds that shows them easy ways to incorporate better eating and sound nutrition into a geeky lifestyle. It also explains how geeky passions like playing games, surfing the Web, reading, and a love of gadgets can be some of the best tools to lose weight and get fit.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Featuring Geeks You Know And Love</h1>
<p><em>Weight Hacking</em> is not only written for geeks by a geek, it will also include many geeks you know and love. It will feature the stories of well-known geeks who've lost weight, like beloved writer/screenwriter/comic writer <strong>Neil Gaiman,</strong> science fiction author and <em>BoingBoing</em> editor <strong>Cory Doctorow,</strong> and geek scientist and healthy eating blogger <strong>Darya Pino.</strong> And other geeks will show you how to eat better, like <strong>Bonnie Burton</strong>, who wrote the <em>Star Wars Craft Book</em> and who'lll be creating new geeky-but-healthy ""food crafts"" for Weight Hacking.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>SO WHAT WILL BE IN THE BOOK?</h2>
<p>Here’s a quick rundown of what you’ll be reading about in <em>Weight Hacking</em>.</p>
<p><strong>1. Reboot Your System:</strong>  Like Neo in The Matrix, you’ve probably “felt it your entire life, that there’s something wrong with the world.” That’s because there is something wrong with the world. It’s been filled with manufactured food-like substances that have little nutrition but way too many calories. And often these food-like substances come with health claims that try to fool us into buying them, like “vitamin water” that in reality contains as much sugar as a Coke. This chapter is the Morpheus of the book, and it will “free your mind” about how you’re being misled about food, and what to do to change that. Welcome to the real world!</p>
<p><strong>2. Plan Your Campaign:</strong> Anyone who’s ever played D&amp;D knows that a successful campaign doesn’t happen without planning. The same is true for losing weight. That’s why this chapter touches on the psychology  of planning to explain why some plans work and others fail. It will also show you why “losing weight” is usually a terrible plan (because it’s actually a goal) and how it’s possible, easy even, to create a plan that will work.</p>
<p><strong>3. Log Your Inventory:</strong> Study after study shows that people don’t know how much food they eat, and they don’t know how much they should be eating. They even have a hard time knowing when they’re full. No wonder losing weight is hard, right? Weight Hacking shows you how to understand what you’re eating and why you’re eating it, then it helps you figure out what you need to change. There is nothing in here about limiting food, it’s about eating the right amount of food.</p>
<p><strong>4. Write Your Optimal Code: </strong>Your body is like a computer, and food is like its programming language. Input the right code and you’ll feel full and satisfied. Input the wrong code and you’ll eat and eat but always be hungry. This chapter will show you how to write the best, most optimal food code for your body so you’ll feel satiated and lose the weight you want to.</p>
<p><strong>5. Overwrite Bad Habits:</strong> Breaking a habit is hard. Changing a habit isn’t. The majority of eating decisions we make are based on habits, and a few subtle modifications to those habits can have a massive impact on losing weight. Weight Hacking will show you how to identify the key habits that will have the most impact for you, and then explain how to modify them. It will also show you the power of creating “if/then” routines to help you make the best possible decisions in all situations.</p>
<p><strong>6. Mod Your Environment:</strong> The shape of your plates, the way you arrange your refrigerator, the brand of pants you buy…all of these things unconsciously influence how much food you eat. In the last 10 years a lot of ground-breaking research has shown that simple modifications to the environment around us can have a huge impact on losing weight, and it’s not particularly hard. This chapter will show you how.</p>
<p><strong>7. Reformat Your Body:</strong> The rule of thumb is that weight loss is 80% about eating and 20% about moving. This chapter is focused on the 20%. Usually a discussion about moving and exercise evokes terror in geeks, whose main memories of a gym often revolve around painful experiences at school (at least mine did!). Fear not, a geeky lifestyle is fully compatible with (and in many ways ideally suited for) moving more.</p>
<p><strong>8. Planned Obsolescence:</strong> Once you reach your goal weight, you need to know how you’re going to stay there. This chapter will show you how to segue from “weight loss” mode to “maintenance mode,” something almost everyone neglects. Ever wonder why so many people lose a lot of weight then put it right back on?  Because they never think about maintenance. Weighthackers know better.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>BONUS SECTIONS</h4>
<p><strong>101 Tips &amp; Tricks:</strong> As I did the research for <em>Weight Hacking</em> I was continually writing down little tidbits I wanted to remember to use in my daily life. These are simple tactics and psychological tips that can help you in the everyday situations that often trip up people trying to lose weight.</p>
<p><strong>Awesome Gear:</strong> I keep a running list of cool gadgets that can actually help people lose weight and stay in shape. This section will give you a rundown of the best current gear out there and explain what’s worth buying (and why).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So that's my story. If you've read this far, I hope it means you're interested enough in <em>Weight Hacking</em> to take the next step and make a contribution. Remember, all it takes is signing up for one of the awesome perks on the right. Thanks!</p></div>","UPDATE 1: Weight Hacking has been getting a lot of attention since we launched.

Weight Hacking will show you how to identify the key habits that will have the most impact for you, and then explain how to modify them. It will also show you the power of creating “if/then” routines to help you make the best possible decisions in all situations.
6. Mod Your Environment: The shape of your plates, the way you arrange your refrigerator, the brand of pants you buy…all of these things unconsciously influence how much food you eat. In the last 10 years a lot of ground-breaking research has shown that simple modifications to the environment around us can have a huge impact on losing weight, and it’s not particularly hard. This chapter will show you how.
7. Reformat Your Body: The rule of thumb is that weight loss is 80% about eating and 20% about moving. This chapter is focused on the 20%. Usually a discussion about moving and exercise evokes terror in geeks, whose main memories of a gym often revolve around painful experiences at school (at least mine did!). Fear not, a geeky lifestyle is fully compatible with (and in many ways ideally suited for) moving more.
8. Planned Obsolescence: Once you reach your goal weight, you need to know how you’re going to stay there. This chapter will show you how to segue from “weight loss” mode to “maintenance mode,” something almost everyone neglects. Ever wonder why so many people lose a lot of weight then put it right back on?  Because they never think about maintenance. Weighthackers know better.

your support to publish <i>NOW IS THE HOUR OF HER RETURN</i>, a collection of mystical poems celebrating the Divine
Feminine in her incarnation as Kali Ma—the Great Mother Goddess of India. The
book chronicles a spiritual journey I began in December 2011 when I woke before
dawn one morning with a poem to Kali fully formed upon my lips.<p></p>
<p></p><p>Over the next two
years I composed more than fifty other poems to Kali Ma, some written as
conversations, others in narrative form. All flowed out of an ecstatic state of
grace in which I felt “filled up” with Her presence. For many years I have
prayed the rosary, which I practice as a devotion to the Goddess in ALL her
incarnations—from Inanna to Isis to Venus to Mary—but I had never had an
experience of this kind.</p><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p><p>I wrote the first
dozen poems before discovering that there is a long tradition of Kali verse in India, where Bengali mystics like
Ramprasad (1723 – 1775) composed hymns to the Goddess in a state of
ecstatic bliss. I had read the <i>Gospel of Sri
Ramakrishna </i>some years earlier
without realizing that the one he called “Mother” was no other than Kali Ma.
Before these poems began to flow out of me, I had only a passing familiarity
with Hindu poetry or philosophy.</p><p></p>
<p>My poems to Kali arrived unbidden and
unrehearsed—as fierce and wild and tender as the Great Mother Goddess herself.
I set them down as they came with few concessions to poetic convention,
allowing Her words and Her presence alone to guide my pen.</p><p></p><p>The following was the first poem I wrote:<br/></p><p></p><blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;"">My Mother, Daughter,<br/>Sister, Lover, Bride is One<br/>With all qualities. It’s<br/>Pointless trying to<br/>Find a thing that She<br/>Is not.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;"">I pour myself out<br/>Each day, turn<br/>Inward each night, turn<br/>Flips and somersaults<br/>At Her feet<br/>Like Shiva.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;"">I am barely conscious<br/>During this. I’m along<br/>For the ride of the Cosmos.<br/>She stands with one<br/>Foot planted firmly<br/>On my chest,</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;"">The other holds my<br/>Thigh, the weight of her<br/>Like so many<br/>Stars pulled inside out,<br/>Made fine and perfect<br/>In their fall.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;"">I become mass only, so<br/>Light I become dark, so<br/>Dark I become light again.<br/>The Broken Heart<br/>Of a galaxy<br/>Is a Universe Complete.</span></blockquote><blockquote><span style=""font-style: normal;"">So let me put these<br/>Questions before you: they<br/>Must be answered.

</p><p>Hello, my name is Travis Gray, I'm 43 years young, I was born in
Arlington, Texas where I still live today. I  have
two sons, Joe and Cole who I am very, very proud of.  I have been self employed for most of my life, if you had a PRIMESTAR satellite in the DFW area, there's a good chance my company either installed or serviced you.   <br/></p><p>After a 20 year failed marriage and a few
other major life changing events, I set out on a journey
to restore my broken spirit and find my purpose, passion and meaning in this
life.  Through this journey I've discovered an entirely new way of thinking that has opened my heart and mind to a world of opportunities I never would have imagined before.  In this book I describe the systemic process I've followed and outline a clear path to help you live a life of purpose by your own design.  </p><p><i><b>Out of adversity comes opportunity, failure is a given, growth is optional.</b></i><br/></p>
<p><span> </span><span></span></p><p>I wi<span></span><span></span><span>sh I could tell you a big
secret that would allow you to simply snap your fingers, have everything you
want and live a life of purpose, unfortunately, I don't have that for you.   The fact of the matter is, it takes work, determination, will power and most of all direction.  However, the first step is <i>desire</i>, you have to be tired enough of losing to change.  I address this in chapter 1, there's a system to achieve anything you desire and you must have a desire to achieve anything on purpose.</span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/503519/files/20140412133245-Life-isnt-about-waiting-for-the-storm-to-pass-its-about-learning-to-dance-in-the-rain1.jpg?1397334765"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>One of the hardest things I've found to overcome is the lies
that I tell myself.  Have you ever made a
decision to take a stand or make a change;  stop smoking, lose weight/stick to a diet, change jobs, leave a toxic
relationship, spend more time with your spouse/kids.....make a real shift in
your life, like a new year's resolution? 
You can feel it you know it's
true, you're going to do it this time, you want it bad enough to do the
work!!  Then something happens, anything
happens and wham your lost, sold out, you give it away like last year's fruit
cake, then you start minimizing, telling yourself you didn't really want it any
way, maybe next week, next month, next year, after this carton, one more
doughnut won't kill me, I'll spend next weekend with them, I'll buy her some
flowers for her birthday, it doesn't matter, nobody else cares any way, the
kids didn't mind, the dog got out again.....blah blah blah .....anything to keep from having to feel the pain
of failure and face your reality. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/503609/files/20140324052737-Self-Motivational-Quotes-Desktop-Wallpapers-Yogesh-Goel-ygoel_com-19.jpg?1397336652"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p> This

that had seemed impossible to me.  I had an auction and sold 
everything I owned, quit smoking, lost 30 lbs, stopped biting my nails, completely set 
aside
two major addictions,  maintained
an exercise program for over two years, dissolved most of my past pains 
and
regrets, restored a broken relationship with my father, and continue to 
push against my doubts, fears, boundaries and comfort zones at an accelerated
rate.   Are you where you want to be?   Are you happy with the way your life is going?  What would you change if you could actually design your life the way you wanted it?  If you could do anything you wanted and knew you couldn't fail, what would you do?  Life keeps score whether you do or not, there's nothing personal about it.  I walk you through a life budget, a step by step process of revealing your true priorities Vs your actual behavior.  Life rewards your actions, not your intentions.  If you want something you've never had, you'll have to do something you've never done.
Hello, my name is Travis Gray, I'm 43 years young, I was born in
Arlington, Texas where I still live today. I  have
two sons, Joe and Cole who I am very, very proud of.  I have been self employed for most of my life, if you had a PRIMESTAR satellite in the DFW area, there's a good chance my company either installed or serviced you.   After a 20 year failed marriage and a few
other major life changing events, I set out on a journey
to restore my broken spirit and find my purpose, passion and meaning in this
life.  Through this journey I've discovered an entirely new way of thinking that has opened my heart and mind to a world of opportunities I never would have imagined before.  In this book I describe the systemic process I've followed and outline a clear path to help you live a life of purpose by your own design.  Out of adversity comes opportunity, failure is a given, growth is optional.
 I wish I could tell you a big
secret that would allow you to simply snap your fingers, have everything you
want and live a life of purpose, unfortunately, I don't have that for you.   The fact of the matter is, it takes work, determination, will power and most of all direction.  However, the first step is desire, you have to be tired enough of losing to change.  I address this in chapter 1, there's a system to achieve anything you desire and you must have a desire to achieve anything on purpose.One of the hardest things I've found to overcome is the lies
that I tell myself.  Have you ever made a
decision to take a stand or make a change;  stop smoking, lose weight/stick to a diet, change jobs, leave a toxic
relationship, spend more time with your spouse/kids.....make a real shift in
your life, like a new year's resolution? 
You can feel it you know it's
true, you're going to do it this time, you want it bad enough to do the
work!!  Then something happens, anything
happens and wham your lost, sold out, you give it away like last year's fruit
cake, then you start minimizing, telling yourself you didn't really want it any
way, maybe next week, next month, next year, after this carton, one more
doughnut won't kill me, I'll spend next weekend with them, I'll buy her some
flowers for her birthday, it doesn't matter, nobody else cares any way, the
kids didn't mind, the dog got out again.....blah blah blah .....anything to keep from having to feel the pain
of failure and face your reality.  This
book will challenge, motivate and inspire you to see through your 
masks,
walls, barriers and denial to begin to reshape and form a deeper 
understanding
of who you are, what you want and what's standing in your way. I will 
give you the tools and techniques to unlock the secrets to your inner
strength and self motivation that will carry you through the process of
redefining and ultimately living your life on purpose.  This 
book is about answering that voice, that desire deep in your heart.  
It's about facing your doubts and fears head on and all out.  Changing 
your default behavior to positive behavior.  Changing the way you make 
decisions so you'll actually have a chance of getting what you want.  
It's about allowing yourself the freedom to win or lose.  It's about 
understanding you can do anything if you just do the work.  You can have

As a believer in love and romance, i come to you ultimately as just an average guy, but an average guy who has not had an average life. But how does one even 
start a letter like this.<br/>
I guess at the beginning right?<br/><br/>
Well, to tell you the story of my last 6 months and do it justice in one
 letter, is probably impossible, and I guess that’s exactly why I am 
writing a book about it.<br/><br/>
But, I will however try.<br/><br/>
My name is Shaun Myburg. I am a writer by heart, and a romantic by soul.<br/><br/>
I guess like anyone who lives this way, it is because life has made me this way.<br/>
You see, my life hasn’t exactly been easy, in fact, it has been downright tragic.<br/><br/>
For a long time, I was bitter about the things life had done to me, and used it as an excuse to be sad and lonely.<br/>
However, I spent my entire life looking for love, experiencing heartache
 on top of heartbreak. Yet, I never gave up. I knew my experiences in 
life were something that would both make me a stronger person, but also 
keep people away from me.<br/><br/>
You see, almost 25 years ago, I lost both my father and brother within a
 year of each other. You can imagine the impact that has on an 11 year 
old boy. It either sends you down a path you battle to come back from, 
or it turns you into a man.<br/><br/>
I am proud that I chose the latter. I was forced to become a man and take care of my mother, something I have done ever since.<br/>
As the years passed by, I saw my life disappear into the distance as my 
life became filled with unjust responsibilities. It was simply the hand I
 was dealt.<br/><br/>
Through the years I continued searching for love of my own and someone 
to be with, but it simply never happened. And at the age of 35, I was 
lonelier than I had ever been. However, being a romantic, I still had to
 believe epic love stories could still exist
 in the world, and over the years, I continued to make grand gestures of
 love to those who had my heart. But that love was never reciprocated. 
Inexplicably, nobody ever fell in love with me. To the point where I 
felt there was something wrong with me and the
 way I viewed the world.<br/><br/>
By the end of 2013, I had all by given up on love, and conceded that 
maybe, just maybe I was meant to be alone. It saddened me, but I made 
peace with it.<br/><br/>
Then, in a serendipitous moment, I “met” the girl who would change my life.<br/>
Now, in order to prevent any unwanted attention(embarrassment?) to her, I
 wont mention her real name, but for the sake of the story, let’s call 
her “Blue”.<br/><br/>
You see, through a mutual friend, Blue and I became internet friends. 
She was based in Doha, Qatar, and me, I was here in South Africa.<br/>
Blue and I became fast friends, and she eventually began encouraging me 
to follow what I really loved – writing. In December of 2013, I began 
writing my first novel. Amazingly, in a month I had finished it. Blue 
was with me every step of the way, cheering me
 on, keeping me inspired. In a month she had begun transforming me into 
the man I was meant to be. I found myself falling in love with Blue, and
 because of her reading my book (it was an autobiography), I felt Blue 
had feelings for me.<br/><br/>
We understood what we had at this stage was just a very strong 
friendship. But it was more than strong enough to want to meet each 
other in person.<br/><br/>
In January 2014, I decided to take a leap of faith, and decided to 
surprise Blue by visiting her in Qatar. I didn’t want to tell her, as I 
wanted to keep it a surprise. On the 16th January, just three days 
before I was supposed to fly out, I finally told her
 via a Skype call (as I needed to make sure she would be there) that I 
would be spending a week with her in Qatar. She was in tears of joy over
 my news, and was touched that someone would do this amazing gesture for
 her.<br/><br/>
That night, I travelled home via the train, overjoyed that she had 
responded so well to my news. I finally felt like I had found the girl 
that was worth crossing oceans to get to. When I arrived at the station 
that night however, fate once again intervened.
 I was attacked by three men, robbed, stabbed twice and dragged out into
 a field to be killed. I fought for my life that night. I fought because I
 would rather be killed running towards Blue, than being dragged away 
from her. The effects of the attack had heartbreaking
 repercussions however, and at the 11th hour, my trip to Qatar fell 
through. I was robbed of my money, my ipad with my first book writtern on it, and even the 
glasses off my face, but more heartbreakingly, two teddy bears
 I had bought for Blue. That seemed to upset me the most, but I knew 
that the next day I would be receiving my visa and getting to Blue. It 
was the only thing that kept me going.<br/><br/>
Then the next day, I received word that the Visa company had incorrectly
 filled out my Visa application and it was rejection. They had not known
 it had to be applied for IN Qatar. I was devastated, and hurting.<br/><br/>
As a result of not being able to travel, I lost my flight as it was non 
refundable, and wasn’t sure when I would be able to fly again. I felt 
like I had let Blue down after making her the ultimate promise, and then
 just a few hours later it felt like my life
 had fallen apart. Blue was understanding of everything, but I knew her 
heart was saddened. Financially the attack set me back at least 6 months
 in my life.<br/>
Over the next few months, I began writing a second book, once again 
inspired by Blue, but this time, it was also about her. We tried several
 more times to arrange another meeting, and each time our meetings fell 
though. her coming her, me going there. It was
 torturous on the heart, and we began wondering if the universe was 
trying to keep us apart.<br/><br/>
As the months passed, we experienced every emotion that came with love, 
except for the joy of being together, and eventually things broke down 
and on the 24th April 2014 we had what could be perceived as our first 
“argument”. Blue was upset that she kept having
 to disappointment about not getting to South Africa, but from that 
conversation, I made Blue a promise. I told her to story stressing about
 getting to me, I would go anywhere in the world to get to her.<br/><br/>
Because of the nature of Blue’s job, she traveled around the world, and 
he next stop would be in a week’s time in Yangon, Myanmar. There and 
then I promised her I would do everything in my power to get to her in 7
 days time. I knew if I got this right we would
 have less than 48 hours together. However, I had 3 days to organize a 
flight, hotel and visa.<br/><br/>
Against all odds, and a story that is worth a letter of it’s own, I 
managed to get everything right, and would be traveling from 
Johannesburg to Hong Kong, then on to Yangon. It would be a 12 hour 
flight, followed by 13 hour transit wait, followed by another
 4 hour flight. But at least I would get to spend a few hours with the 
girl of my dreams.<br/><br/>
We finally met, and spent the most heartbreakingly perfect few hours, 
knowing that in a few hours we would  have to let go of each other once 
more. But we knew at that moment, we were in love with each other.<br/><br/>
I traveled back on a 3 hour flight, 17 hour transit wait, and 13 hour 
flight back to Johannesburg. Knowing I would do it again in a heartbeat.<br/>
Following that moment, and now a month later, Blue and I have fallen 
more in love with each each and every day. Despite our distance, we know
 we are meant to be together. However, our story, and the very obvious 
obstacles, have only just begun. However the
 longer we stay apart, the more it hurts.<br/><br/>
As I try and find a way to get to Blue, this is where I reach out to you for help in telling this story.<br/>
Blue and I deserve more than just a few hours together.<br/><br/>
I made her a promise in January that I would be spending a week with her
 in Doha,Qatar, and through a horrible series of events, was not able to
 keep that promise. No matter what else I do in life, I will always 
regret not being able to keep that promise to
 her.<br/><br/>
I am not one to ask for things, as I have always battled my way through 
life with resilience and determination, but as I now find myself on the 
brink of exhaustion, I ask for you to help me show Blue that fairy tales
 do exist. And my love for her is endless.
 She deserves that much. Her life has not been easy either, and there is a reason we have found each other through the most impossible or circumstances.<br/><br/>
I will never ever give up trying to get to her, but sometimes, just 
sometimes, you need to ask the universe for a break. And I ask you for 
help in keep my promise to Blue by getting to Qatar even just for a 
week.<br/><br/>

<h2>Unashamed. A memoir by Aziza Kibibi</h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Aziza Kibibi. I am a single mom of five beautiful children that I am very proud of. Most men describe me as mysterious, free spirited and charming. Most woman say that I'm confident, smart and witty. But little do they know, is that from ten years old, I was raised as my father’s <a href=""http://www.northjersey.com/news/Aswad_Ayinde_found_guilty_of_raping_his_daughter.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(Aswad Ayinde)</a> sex slave. Oh, and the first four of my five children, are also my brother and sisters.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>This book is the true story of my life; a tale of how surviving my childhood, adolescence and young adulthood, has shaped me into the woman I am today.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/88910/files/20130922050541-azizakibibi_headline_capture.jpg?1379851541"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>I am the eldest of 9 children by my mother, and including my children whom he fathered, the eldest of over twenty-five by my dad. Using events from the present as a vehicle,  history of my life unfolds. I take the reader on a journey through my sheltered life in a polygamous family where I was home schooled, molested, beaten and trained to satisfy my father’s every sexual desire. In addition, I invite the reader into my present life where I've triumphed over the setbacks and challenges from my upbringing.  </p>
<p>I describe how while growing up I watched my father turn from a loving, talented respected member of the community, into the abusive monster that God spared my own children from growing up with. Via my transition through adolescence the reader witnesses my failed attempts at protecting my younger siblings from the fate I had befallen; my father’s video directing career where we interacted with popular ’90’s music artists such as <a href=""http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/aswad-ayinde-director-fugees-video-killing-softly-charged-impregnating-daughters-article-1.168396"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean of the music group The Fugees</a>, and the events that led to the unveiling of our family secret. </p>

<br/><p>UNASHAMED is a tale of tragedy, growth, resilience, survival, faith and forgiveness.  </p>
<p>I want to share my story with the public because I feel I have a moral responsibility to other men, women and children (both victims and victimizers) that may be affected by child molestation and incest, to raise awareness and lend a voice to those that are and have been abused. Unlike the safety mechanism that other victims utilize, I have not repressed the torture that my father inflicted on me, yet I function normally in life love and relationships. I consider this unique because I believe that through my writing it is important to convey to the reader the thoughts and feelings of a victim while being abused. This is also what makes my memoir stand out from other books that have been published with this theme.</p>
<p>As for my personal successes in life; despite my limited homeschooled education, I am currently  pursuing my associates in Liberal Arts - Communications with a 3.7 GPA (my first classroom experience) at Essex County College. I have won three Woman’s Opportunity awards from <a href=""http://www.soroptimist.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soroptamist International</a> for my writing. I currently administrate two blogs and, I run a catering and dessert company called <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/sincerelyz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sincerely, Z</a>. I am also raising, and have wonderful relationships with my four talented children whom I love more than anything. </p>
<p>Unlike what is and was available to me and countless others, my book will provide insight, support and inspiration to victims, survivors and those that love us via my voice shamelessly sharing the perils of  my victimization, as well as my triumphs as an overcomer. But this book is not only for those connected to incest or sexual child abuse.  I hope that my tales will encourage and motivate anyone going through troublesome times, to push forward and stay strong no matter what challenges life presents one with. Though themed in struggle, Unashamed is a beautiful tragedy filled with provocative scenarios, funny moments, exciting journeys and insightful thought provoking ideas. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need  <br/>
</h3>
<p>At 35 years in the making and 3 years in the writing, <b>Unashamed</b> the 410 page manuscript is complete. And now I need your help to get it published. </p>

Our goal of $19,077 will prep, print, bind, and help distribute completed hard cover and soft cover copies of Unashamed, making you and I the publishers of this book. With this initial launch, I hope to spread the word and promote Unashamed; which will be available on a print on demand basis.  </p>
<h4>Funds will go towards the following:</h4>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Editing for grammar</li>
<li>Editing for content and continuity</li>

<p><br/></p>
<br/><h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Because there is no other piece of literature of this nature on the market, you are helping to make history.  I myself feel blessed to be a part of something that could prevent pain and suffering in others, and may even save a few lives. I want to offer you the same opportunity. In addition I will include you in the journey of realizing this project by acknowledging your kindness on my Facebook and Twitter. </p>
<p></p>
<p>As the size of the donations increase, the perks grow to include, copies of Unashamed with and without autographs; a dessert party catered by my company Sincerely, Z; book readings and speaking engagements (great for organizations). There's even a perk where I send you a real photograph of myself as a teenager, with a short true story from my life that no one else is privy to.</p>
<p></p>To me there's no such thing as failure; only opportunities to do it better the next time. So If we do not reach our goal, the funds will go towards whatever it will allow in publishing as many copies as possible.

I'm sure your wondering why don't I just get Unashamed published by a traditional publishing company? I must confess that is ideally what I would like to do, but with the changes in publishing, it is more difficult to achieve, and takes more time for an unknown author to get published. So while I don't discount the possibility of signing with a publishing house, I've decided to take matters into my own hands. If by a different blessing my book is picked up by a publisher, have no fear, a backup plan is here. <br/></p>
<p>All perks will still be honored to the best of my ability. In addition, your donations will contrubute to the development of my non profit organization <b>Precious Little Ladies</b>. </p>
<p>The purpose of this organization is to strengthen the bond between mothers and daughters through information, education, empowerment, support and understanding. </p>
<p>With these tools a family could better prevent, cope and recover from incidents of child sexual abuse. </p>
<p><b>Unashamed</b> is not just a book, and I am not just a victim of child molestation. What we are creating here is a movement that will invite change. <b>Unashamed</b> will provide something that I never had. A map to healing, encouragement to forge on and strength to make a change; from someone who understands. </p>

Unashamed. A memoir by Aziza Kibibi

Hello, my name is Aziza Kibibi. I am a single mom of five beautiful children that I am very proud of. Most men describe me as mysterious, free spirited and charming. Most woman say that I'm confident, smart and witty. But little do they know, is that from ten years old, I was raised as my father’s (Aswad Ayinde) sex slave. Oh, and the first four of my five children, are also my brother and sisters.


This book is the true story of my life; a tale of how surviving my childhood, adolescence and young adulthood, has shaped me into the woman I am today.



I am the eldest of 9 children by my mother, and including my children whom he fathered, the eldest of over twenty-five by my dad. Using events from the present as a vehicle,  history of my life unfolds. I take the reader on a journey through my sheltered life in a polygamous family where I was home schooled, molested, beaten and trained to satisfy my father’s every sexual desire. In addition, I invite the reader into my present life where I've triumphed over the setbacks and challenges from my upbringing.  
I describe how while growing up I watched my father turn from a loving, talented respected member of the community, into the abusive monster that God spared my own children from growing up with. Via my transition through adolescence the reader witnesses my failed attempts at protecting my younger siblings from the fate I had befallen; my father’s video directing career where we interacted with popular ’90’s music artists such as Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean of the music group The Fugees, and the events that led to the unveiling of our family secret. 



UNASHAMED is a tale of tragedy, growth, resilience, survival, faith and forgiveness.  
I want to share my story with the public because I feel I have a moral responsibility to other men, women and children (both victims and victimizers) that may be affected by child molestation and incest, to raise awareness and lend a voice to those that are and have been abused. Unlike the safety mechanism that other victims utilize, I have not repressed the torture that my father inflicted on me, yet I function normally in life love and relationships.

Our goal of $19,077 will prep, print, bind, and help distribute completed hard cover and soft cover copies of Unashamed, making you and I the publishers of this book. With this initial launch, I hope to spread the word and promote Unashamed; which will be available on a print on demand basis.  
Funds will go towards the following:


Editing for grammar
Editing for content and continuity
Copyediting
Book cover and jacket design
Interior Layout
Photos and illustrations
Printing
Binding
ISBN assingment
Online distribution
Marketing





What You Get
Because there is no other piece of literature of this nature on the market, you are helping to make history.  I myself feel blessed to be a part of something that could prevent pain and suffering in others, and may even save a few lives. I want to offer you the same opportunity. In addition I will include you in the journey of realizing this project by acknowledging your kindness on my Facebook and Twitter. 

As the size of the donations increase, the perks grow to include, copies of Unashamed with and without autographs; a dessert party catered by my company Sincerely, Z; book readings and speaking engagements (great for organizations). There's even a perk where I send you a real photograph of myself as a teenager, with a short true story from my life that no one else is privy to.
To me there's no such thing as failure; only opportunities to do it better the next time. So If we do not reach our goal, the funds will go towards whatever it will allow in publishing as many copies as possible. After which, I will find other ways to bring this project to fruition.

Support comes in all forms
Don't let lack of funds stop you from showing support. There are other ways you can help.


Spread the word. Share my campaign on your Facebook and/or Twitter
Suggest my speaking perk or catered event to your church, synagog, temple, business or other organization.
Go to my blog, Unashamed An Open Book, and cheer me on.

The Impact
But wait. I'm sure your wondering why don't I just get Unashamed published by a traditional publishing company? I must confess that is ideally what I would like to do, but with the changes in publishing, it is more difficult to achieve, and takes more time for an unknown author to get published. So while I don't discount the possibility of signing with a publishing house, I've decided to take matters into my own hands. If by a different blessing my book is picked up by a publisher, have no fear, a backup plan is here. 
All perks will still be honored to the best of my ability. In addition, your donations will contrubute to the development of my non profit organization Precious Little Ladies. 
The purpose of this organization is to strengthen the bond between mothers and daughters through information, education, empowerment, support and understanding. 
With these tools a family could better prevent, cope and recover from incidents of child sexual abuse. 
Unashamed is not just a book, and I am not just a victim of child molestation. What we are creating here is a movement that will invite change. Unashamed will provide something that I never had. A map to healing, encouragement to forge on and strength to make a change; from someone who understands. 
Join me in impacting the world and making a change. Join me in saving lives. Join me in inspiring over 3 million children and 76 million adults to be UNASHAMED.

It's a sexy, diverse, grassroots campaign story that readers have said feels like a West Wing season or an HBO series. I wrote it in 2013 and 2014 during a somewhat ridiculous series of exploding startups and layoffs. My career chaos means fun stuff to read for you! The feedback from my early readers has been overwhelmingly positive; honestly it's been beyond the wildest expectations I had when I started out on this project. So I'm starting this pre-ordering campaign to get a good solid edit, a little dough for marketing, and a first print-on-demand run.</p><p>The good news is, the book is done. It's a little over 98,000 words. (novels usually run 80k to 100k words) eBook conversion isn't that tricky, so I've got a couple files sitting here on my machine with the whole book that I could upload to Amazon.</p><p>But. I haven't done that, for a good reason: <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">I want this book to be as awesome as possible.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">That means giving it a good solid round of professional editing. While I'm going to keep the marketing pretty minimal, I'll need a little dough in the piggybank to get it started. And I would like to do a small (for now) print-on-demand run, so readers who prefer ink and paper to eBooks can enjoy it too.</span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If you're curious from all this but still not sure, <a href=""http://read2063.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">you can download the first chapter for free</a>!</span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 36px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 40px;background-color: initial;"">What You Get</span><br/></p><p>I'm keeping the perks pretty simple. At the low end, you get ebooks, and since you're signing on early, you'll get them two weeks before I release them for sale to the general public. In the middle range, you'll get print copies from the small print-on-demand run that I'm planning on doing. (if you're not an eBook type and want a print version but don't want to pay a bit more, you'll have to be patient - it will be available in print at some point, I just can't yet say when.)</p><p>At the high end, I'll include your name on a special page of patrons. And at the very high end, I'm particularly excited about the $1000 perk: I'm going to throw a no-holds-barred fancypants dinner for the ten of you first to grab that. If you're willing to put up that kind of dough for this project, I can guarantee you're someone interesting! And it will be fun to introduce you all to each other.</p><p><b>New Perk: Hardcover with Merchandise!</b></p><p>Just added: a new perk that's the eBook two weeks before the masses, the hardcover copy when it's done - and a t-shirt, mug and fancy sticker! It's only a little more than the hardcover, too! There's only 25 of these since fulfilling them will be a pain in the keister! So snap them up now...</p><div>

It's a sexy, diverse, grassroots campaign story that readers have said feels like a West Wing season or an HBO series. I wrote it in 2013 and 2014 during a somewhat ridiculous series of exploding startups and layoffs. My career chaos means fun stuff to read for you! The feedback from my early readers has been overwhelmingly positive; honestly it's been beyond the wildest expectations I had when I started out on this project. So I'm starting this pre-ordering campaign to get a good solid edit, a little dough for marketing, and a first print-on-demand run.The good news is, the book is done. It's a little over 98,000 words. (novels usually run 80k to 100k words) eBook conversion isn't that tricky, so I've got a couple files sitting here on my machine with the whole book that I could upload to Amazon.But. I haven't done that, for a good reason: I want this book to be as awesome as possible.That means giving it a good solid round of professional editing. While I'm going to keep the marketing pretty minimal, I'll need a little dough in the piggybank to get it started. And I would like to do a small (for now) print-on-demand run, so readers who prefer ink and paper to eBooks can enjoy it too.If you're curious from all this but still not sure, you can download the first chapter for free!What You GetI'm keeping the perks pretty simple. At the low end, you get ebooks, and since you're signing on early, you'll get them two weeks before I release them for sale to the general public. In the middle range, you'll get print copies from the small print-on-demand run that I'm planning on doing. (if you're not an eBook type and want a print version but don't want to pay a bit more, you'll have to be patient - it will be available in print at some point, I just can't yet say when.)At the high end, I'll include your name on a special page of patrons. And at the very high end, I'm particularly excited about the $1000 perk: I'm going to throw a no-holds-barred fancypants dinner for the ten of you first to grab that. If you're willing to put up that kind of dough for this project, I can guarantee you're someone interesting! And it will be fun to introduce you all to each other.New Perk: Hardcover with Merchandise!Just added: a new perk that's the eBook two weeks before the masses, the hardcover copy when it's done - and a t-shirt, mug and fancy sticker! It's only a little more than the hardcover, too! There's only 25 of these since fulfilling them will be a pain in the keister! So snap them up now...

<div>I'm 24 years old and I've been writing for 20 of them. You can check out my <a href=""http://unabridgedro.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Rohini's Blog"">most recent work on my blog.</a>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My passion for writing about the world around me led me to write a novella which I intend to self-publish on Amazon. The novella is titled <em>Descending the Corporate Ladder. </em>The writing is mostly complete, and it's now time to edit, design a cover, and publish -- that's where I could use a little help from you. </div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Help me help others write.</h2>
<div>
<p>As I prepare to self-publish, I need $2500 for final editing, designing a cover, and printing a few physical copies of my book. I'll pay it forward by donating up to $2500 to the SF WritersCorps, an organization dedicated to raising literacy in the Bay Area. Funds after $5000 will go towards additional printing and editing for my book. </p>
<h3><strong>You Get</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>A book </li>
<li>The SWEET perk for which you qualify</li>
<li>Warm and fuzzies of helping two people (me and an underprivileged kid or young-adult) achieve their writing dreams</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>You Give</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Improved literacy and creative writing skills to SF youth</li>
<li>A means for this author to launch her novella into the world</li>
</ul>
<h2>
<br/>What's the book about?</h2>
<p>The power of keen determination, the reminder that life can be simultaneously trivial and heavy, and above all, the importance of recognizing your passions. The story follows a colorful free-spirited young professional who, increasingly disillusioned with the world around her and in desperate need of self-validation, decides to write a book. With the help of her cancer-diagnosed writing mentor, she discovers herself by writing about her own experiences with school, work, relationships, family, racism, and gender discrimination.</p>
<p>A candidly introspective, wise, and witty narrative about what it means to be a young twenty-something as it's experienced: the search for a niche, companion, and purpose in life. <br/><br/></p>
<h2>What are early readers saying?</h2>
<p><span>""A timely lesson for our generation, <em>Descending the Corporate Ladder</em> perfectly encapsulates what it means to shave our creative instincts in order to fit the corporate mold and what it takes revisit our innermost ambitions. Highly recommend.""</span></p>
<p><span><span>""[Rohini's] ability to reflect upon the confusion of being a 20 some year old today with a little bit of wit brings a sense relief to me. What I liked the most about the novella was that the author's self-reflection provided a forum for me to think through my experiences while reading.""<br/></span></span></p>

<h2><strong><br/>A sneak peek (it's Chapter 6).</strong></h2>
<div><span>     Sunday morning came before I knew it. I awoke out of breath. <em>Snap out of it. They accepted you for a reason. This is embarrassing.</em> After an abridged morning routine I walked to the Wilde House, a Victorian building with fifty regal steps leading up to the front door.<br/>     I climbed up the stairs. Five…ten…<em>You can do this…</em>Fifteen…<em>What am I doing here? I should turn around…</em>Fourteen…<em>You’re being a child. Do you want to write a book or not?...</em>Fifteen. I finally made it to the top where the gatekeeper, a mustachioed man wearing a tweed jacket, greeted me at the door. Before he could ask, I spat out the passcode. I was out of place (and not just because I was still standing outside). </span></div>
<div><span>     The gatekeeper nodded and opened the door. Another man, who could have been his identical twin, was waiting on the other side of the door. The men exchanged glances, as if communicating telepathically. The second man stared at me to follow him. Not hearing a single word being spoken, I wondered if people at the Writers Guild relied solely on written communication. I followed him as he took me through a maze of tables. He came to a stop in front of a long rectangular mahogany table. Unprepared to stop so suddenly, I walked into him then hopped backwards. I looked like a klutz.</span></div>
<div><span>     Comfortably seated in front of us was an elderly man who could have been my grandfather, dressed in a long sleeve turtleneck, jeans, and sneakers. Sunken cheeks balanced his youthful eyes. His head was almost as shiny as the silver shell of his MacBook. The gatekeeper joined us inside. The first words were spoken. </span></div>
<div><span>     “This is your new protégé, Sabena.” His handlebar mustache twitched as he spoke. “Well, I’ll leave you to it,” he said as he turned and glided away.</span></div>
<div><span>     Left standing and facing the back of his laptop, I extended my arm towards Charles whom I recognized from the photo that accompanied his biography on the Guild website. “Sabena, as you know.” </span></div>
<div><span>     “Such a pleasure to meet you, Sabena. Take a seat, don’t be shy.” I sat.</span></div>
<div><span>     “So what brings you to the Guild? Besides, of course, being accepted into it?”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Well, I’m trying to write,” I took a breath, “I’m trying to write a book,” I cringed as the air left my mouth and congealed as words.</span></div>
<div><span>     “Apparently easier done than said,” he laughed.       </span></div>
<div><span>     “I got a pretty discouraging response from the last person I told. He didn’t think my life is worthy enough to be written about.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Does his reaction matter, though?”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Well, maybe – as a potential reader.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Are you writing this for him?</span></div>
<div><span>     “No, but –”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Then what is the problem? Writing is difficult enough to do for yourself."" My body temperature spiked. I was surprised at his pushing me so early in our relationship, but not angry. While it was just as pointed as my exchanges with colleagues, I valued Charles’s harshness because I saw myself being in his shoes some day, being a “real writer.” The similarity was one I rarely experienced at work. Charles continued. “We do things differently around here. We don’t want to make literature that everyone likes. We want to make literature that is amazing.” He pointed to a framed letter on the wall behind him. “You see that? That was my first rejection letter. It was from a publisher.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Why would you frame that? It feels kind of self-deprecating.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “The rejection was for a science fiction novel that I knew was stellar. I could feel it in my gut. Critics can be clowns sometimes.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “What are you working on now?” I imagined an eighty-year-old version of myself sitting on his side of the table.</span></div>
<div><span>     “A world coming alive as words are written to describe it. Words are the building blocks, after all. I’m building an underwater city, Sub San Francisco.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Clever. How is it coming?”</span></div>
<div><span>     He looked down at his keyboard. “This one has been more difficult than previous ones. Over the last several months, it has become difficult for me to focus.” He looked back at me. “Why are we talking about me? You’re the protagonist here. What are your goals? What happens after your piece is published?” I needed a moment before responding. My plan did not bleed past publishing my first book.</span></div>
<div><span>     “Just continuing to write I guess. Maybe on a beach somewhere.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Isn’t that what you’re doing right now, without the beach?”</span></div>
<div><span>     “It’s hard to focus on writing when I have an unrelated day job. At this point, all I want is to prove to everyone – colleagues, family, friends, and strangers – that I’m capable of producing mature work. Ideally some day I will spend my days writing without being at risk of living on the street.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Sabena, writing does not have to be separate from the rest of your life. No matter where you are, what you are doing, how you feel, you can write.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “That sounds unreasonable given my current situation. My job is my life and it’s taking away from my writing.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “What is your job?”</span></div>
<div><span>     “I work at a large tech company on the business side of things. I guess one day I will be able to run a big company if I want to.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “How is your job taking away from your writing? I clearly don’t know the entire situation but perhaps you don’t have the job that’s right for you.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “No, I think I’m still getting used to it.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Sabena, do you enjoy your work? Why are you doing it?”</span></div>
<div><span>     “I love using what I know about human psychology to create new tech products. It’s an art in itself. Sadly my colleagues don’t value it as much as I do. Unless I have ideas about how we can make more money, they don’t care what I have to say.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “And what about writing? Isn’t it your passion?” </span></div>
<div><span>     “I do love writing, but I just don’t think I can support myself as a writer. And, well – ” I hesitated. He nodded for me to continue, “My parents would be so disappointed. I want to have a respectable career.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Do <em>you</em> respect your current job?” Charles asked as he looked at the clock. I was relieved by the implication as there was no easy response to his question. “Goodness, where does the time go? At the risk of sounding too existential, I’m supposed to be telling you why you’re here, why I’m here, and how the Writers Guild will change your life.” I raised a defiant eyebrow. “Or maybe just your Sunday routine. If you really want to write a book, we need to uncover the <em>atman</em> or soul for your writing – the underlying tone that weaves your words together. All you really need is one spark. If it’s real, it will turn into a fire warm enough to cook up an entire book.” His speech was poetic, as is expected of any experienced writer. “I’ll tell you now that it’s going to be a difficult journey. Do you really want to write a book?”</span></div>
<div><span>     “I do.” Reconsidering was out of the question. I was already autographing book covers in my mind.</span></div>
<div><span>     “Okay. Over the years, I have refined a specific process for successful writing. Are you ready?”</span></div>
<div><span>     “I’m your unwritten book.” A creature of routine, the desire to try new things is foreign to me. But I was beginning to see, to my dismay, that I could not write this book without experienced guidance. Writing a book, an act that was supposed to prove my strength, was instead exposing my weaknesses.</span></div>
<div><span>     “You and I will meet once a week, though you are welcome here whenever you like. During each of our sessions, I will ask you to write a short piece about some aspect of your life, positive or negative, trivial or profound, significant or negligible. As we go through this exercise, we’ll uncover the fundamental soul that is the premise of your novel. You will then be equipped to craft your novel in its entirety.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Charles, this sounds wonderful, and when you are dealing with someone accomplished, this would make perfect sense.” He opened his mouth to respond but I continued, “You’ll quickly see that my life is not exciting. Every vignette will be insignificant. You need to help me write something exhilarating – controversial, poignant, and intellectual. Like that science fiction novel of yours.” I thought for a moment, “The operating word here is <em>fiction</em>.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Sabena, do you think I went to Mars before writing a book about aliens? All of it, every notion, written or unwritten, comes from right up here,” he said, tapping his forehead. “The world in my mind is nothing but the meaning I find in the world around me.” I wished I could borrow his brain. It was what I needed to complete the book I wanted to write.</span></div>
<div><span>     “I just don’t know if this will work – if this will get me where I want to be.”  </span></div>
<div><span>     “It will, because our relationship automatically turns you into a writer.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “What do you mean?”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Think about it. I am going to get to know you through your writing, the same way that most of your readers will. They won’t know you like your friends.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Sure, that’s true.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “One of the most important things to remember as a writer is that most of your readers will never meet you in person. Your words need to come to life when a reader sets his eyes on them.”</span></div>
<div><span>     “But we just talked about how I shouldn’t worry about pleasing my readers.” He scrunched his nose and nodded.</span></div>
<div><span>     “It’s a balancing act. Above all, you should not be writing for anyone but yourself.”     </span></div>
<div><span>     “How did you master all these rules? Who was <em>your</em> Charles?”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Practice, Sabena. Practice and experience.” Like a child, I wished I could snap once and become a grown up. “Sabena, I want to know more about your job. What makes you so passionate about technology, especially after studying psychology? More passionate than, say, my job sitting and writing all day?”</span></div>
<div><span>     “Well –“</span></div>
<div><span>     “Uh-uh-uh,” he shook his head as he typed on an imaginary keyboard in the air. “You’re a writer. I’d rather read about your passion than hear about it. This can be the first piece of our writer-reader relationship.” It was an abrupt ending to our conversation, but I was in no place to question Charles’s tactics. I started to type:</span></div>
<div><em> </em></div>
<div><span>     <em>Last year, as a part of a company-wide wellness initiative, I needed to complete an on-site blood test. To say blood makes me queasy would be an understatement. After fasting for twelve hours beforehand, I went in for my appointment. A volunteer seated me in a chair across from a nurse who gave me an icy stare.</em></span></div>
<div><em>     She started pressing the veins on my arms and hands. “How much water did you drink this morning?” She may have been asking, but it sounded like scolding. My heart pounded. </em></div>
<div><em>     “Um...I don't know...like a couple water bottles.” She wrinkled her brow.</em></div>
<div><em>     “I can’t find your vein. How big was the water bottle?” Without warning she inserted a needle into my hand. Not my arm, but my hand. Shooting pain accompanied. </em></div>
<div><em>     “Oh, you're already starting? I wanted to look away. I can't look at this. I don't know. The bottle was maybe eight or um...” My world started spinning. “I think I'm going to faint,” I told her as I watched blood dribble like molasses from hand to test tube.</em></div>
<div><em>     “Stop moving!How much water did you drink today?”     </em></div>
<div><em>     “I think I'm going to faint,” I repeated. Frustrated, she pulled the needle out of my hand and looked at me.</em></div>
<div><em>     “Do you want to go lie against that wall?” I responded that I needed water. I could feel my body becoming warm; the world was spinning. With a look that said, “Getting you water is not in my job description,"" the nurse reluctantly departed in search of some. But before doing so, she pawned me off to another nurse: “Go sit in that chair. He'll draw your blood.”</em></div>
<div><em>     I moved to the new chair and waited nervously. Finally, it was my turn again.</em></div>
<div><em>     “Oh, here's a really good vein.” The nurse pressed firmly on my arm. “Now if you want to look away, I'm going to start.” I looked away. He continued talking. “Did I hear you say you were going to faint before?”  I nodded. “Well I’m not surprised.I tend to have that effect on women.” I managed to smile. “Don’t worry. You’re anxious and uncomfortable. It’s a natural reaction. And there we go, we're done!” I couldn’t believe that the torture was already over – I didn’t realize when it started.</em></div>
<div><em>     For weeks after my blood test, I thought about my disparate experiences with the two nurses. The male nurse's compassion, empathy, and sense of humor made him perfect for soothing the discomfort of a needle. And the first nurse's unconcern made her a poor fit. She would be a marvelous prison guard. You can’t plug a person into any occupation and expect success.  </em></div>
<div><em>     I am often asked how I keep up in the tech world when I studied psychology. My response is simple: I have always been passionate about technology. When I was choosing a post-graduate job, I knew that as long as I continued to interact with other humans, I would be able to apply my major no matter where I went or what I did. A profound understanding of human psychology -- the ability to connect with others at a deep level, to attribute their behaviors to situations over disposition, and to break down barriers built by cognitive biases -- ensures success in any environment, from drawing blood to building computer software. </em></div>
<div><em>     That first nurse was bad at her job because she lacked fundamental interpersonal skills. She couldn’t connect.

If you ask me, this is why the path from psychology to technology, though unconventional, is completely necessary.</em></div>

<span>     “It can be difficult to express your experiences and emotions in a universal manner, but your ability to do so with powerful inward reflection makes you a natural story-teller and a beautiful writer.” I nodded “thank you.” “Of course I wouldn’t be doing my job if I didn’t tell you there is some room for improvement, but this is an extraordinary start.” That validation was all I needed, and I took it as a comfortable place to break for the day.</span>

I'm 24 years old and I've been writing for 20 of them. You can check out my most recent work on my blog.

 
My passion for writing about the world around me led me to write a novella which I intend to self-publish on Amazon. The novella is titled Descending the Corporate Ladder. The writing is mostly complete, and it's now time to edit, design a cover, and publish -- that's where I could use a little help from you. 
 
Help me help others write.

As I prepare to self-publish, I need $2500 for final editing, designing a cover, and printing a few physical copies of my book. I'll pay it forward by donating up to $2500 to the SF WritersCorps, an organization dedicated to raising literacy in the Bay Area. Funds after $5000 will go towards additional printing and editing for my book. 
You Get

A book 
The SWEET perk for which you qualify
Warm and fuzzies of helping two people (me and an underprivileged kid or young-adult) achieve their writing dreams

You Give

Improved literacy and creative writing skills to SF youth
A means for this author to launch her novella into the world


What's the book about?
The power of keen determination, the reminder that life can be simultaneously trivial and heavy, and above all, the importance of recognizing your passions. The story follows a colorful free-spirited young professional who, increasingly disillusioned with the world around her and in desperate need of self-validation, decides to write a book. With the help of her cancer-diagnosed writing mentor, she discovers herself by writing about her own experiences with school, work, relationships, family, racism, and gender discrimination.
A candidly introspective, wise, and witty narrative about what it means to be a young twenty-something as it's experienced: the search for a niche, companion, and purpose in life. 
What are early readers saying?
""A timely lesson for our generation, Descending the Corporate Ladder perfectly encapsulates what it means to shave our creative instincts in order to fit the corporate mold and what it takes revisit our innermost ambitions. Highly recommend.""
""[Rohini's] ability to reflect upon the confusion of being a 20 some year old today with a little bit of wit brings a sense relief to me. What I liked the most about the novella was that the author's self-reflection provided a forum for me to think through my experiences while reading.""


A sneak peek (it's Chapter 6).
     Sunday morning came before I knew it. I awoke out of breath. Snap out of it. They accepted you for a reason. This is embarrassing. After an abridged morning routine I walked to the Wilde House, a Victorian building with fifty regal steps leading up to the front door.     I climbed up the stairs. Five…ten…You can do this…Fifteen…What am I doing here? I should turn around…Fourteen…You’re being a child. Do you want to write a book or not?...Fifteen. I finally made it to the top where the gatekeeper, a mustachioed man wearing a tweed jacket, greeted me at the door. Before he could ask, I spat out the passcode. I was out of place (and not just because I was still standing outside). 
     The gatekeeper nodded and opened the door. Another man, who could have been his identical twin, was waiting on the other side of the door. The men exchanged glances, as if communicating telepathically. The second man stared at me to follow him. Not hearing a single word being spoken, I wondered if people at the Writers Guild relied solely on written communication. I followed him as he took me through a maze of tables. He came to a stop in front of a long rectangular mahogany table. Unprepared to stop so suddenly, I walked into him then hopped backwards. I looked like a klutz.
     Comfortably seated in front of us was an elderly man who could have been my grandfather, dressed in a long sleeve turtleneck, jeans, and sneakers. Sunken cheeks balanced his youthful eyes. His head was almost as shiny as the silver shell of his MacBook. The gatekeeper joined us inside. The first words were spoken. 
     “This is your new protégé, Sabena.” His handlebar mustache twitched as he spoke. “Well, I’ll leave you to it,” he said as he turned and glided away.
     Left standing and facing the back of his laptop, I extended my arm towards Charles whom I recognized from the photo that accompanied his biography on the Guild website. “Sabena, as you know.” 
     “Such a pleasure to meet you, Sabena. Take a seat, don’t be shy.” I sat.
     “So what brings you to the Guild? Besides, of course, being accepted into it?”
     “Well, I’m trying to write,” I took a breath, “I’m trying to write a book,” I cringed as the air left my mouth and congealed as words.
     “Apparently easier done than said,” he laughed.       
     “I got a pretty discouraging response from the last person I told. He didn’t think my life is worthy enough to be written about.”
     “Does his reaction matter, though?”
     “Well, maybe – as a potential reader.”
     “Are you writing this for him?
     “No, but –”
     “Then what is the problem? Writing is difficult enough to do for yourself."" My body temperature spiked. I was surprised at his pushing me so early in our relationship, but not angry. While it was just as pointed as my exchanges with colleagues, I valued Charles’s harshness because I saw myself being in his shoes some day, being a “real writer.” The similarity was one I rarely experienced at work. Charles continued. “We do things differently around here. We don’t want to make literature that everyone likes. We want to make literature that is amazing.” He pointed to a framed letter on the wall behind him. “You see that? That was my first rejection letter. It was from a publisher.”
     “Why would you frame that? It feels kind of self-deprecating.”
     “The rejection was for a science fiction novel that I knew was stellar. I could feel it in my gut. Critics can be clowns sometimes.”
     “What are you working on now?” I imagined an eighty-year-old version of myself sitting on his side of the table.
     “A world coming alive as words are written to describe it. Words are the building blocks, after all. I’m building an underwater city, Sub San Francisco.”
     “Clever. How is it coming?”
     He looked down at his keyboard. “This one has been more difficult than previous ones. Over the last several months, it has become difficult for me to focus.” He looked back at me. “Why are we talking about me? You’re the protagonist here. What are your goals? What happens after your piece is published?” I needed a moment before responding. My plan did not bleed past publishing my first book.
     “Just continuing to write I guess. Maybe on a beach somewhere.”
     “Isn’t that what you’re doing right now, without the beach?”
     “It’s hard to focus on writing when I have an unrelated day job. At this point, all I want is to prove to everyone – colleagues, family, friends, and strangers – that I’m capable of producing mature work. Ideally some day I will spend my days writing without being at risk of living on the street.”
     “Sabena, writing does not have to be separate from the rest of your life. No matter where you are, what you are doing, how you feel, you can write.”
     “That sounds unreasonable given my current situation. My job is my life and it’s taking away from my writing.”
     “What is your job?”
     “I work at a large tech company on the business side of things. I guess one day I will be able to run a big company if I want to.”
     “How is your job taking away from your writing? I clearly don’t know the entire situation but perhaps you don’t have the job that’s right for you.”
     “No, I think I’m still getting used to it.”
     “Sabena, do you enjoy your work? Why are you doing it?”
     “I love using what I know about human psychology to create new tech products. It’s an art in itself. Sadly my colleagues don’t value it as much as I do. Unless I have ideas about how we can make more money, they don’t care what I have to say.”
     “And what about writing? Isn’t it your passion?” 
     “I do love writing, but I just don’t think I can support myself as a writer. And, well – ” I hesitated. He nodded for me to continue, “My parents would be so disappointed. I want to have a respectable career.”
     “Do you respect your current job?” Charles asked as he looked at the clock. I was relieved by the implication as there was no easy response to his question. “Goodness, where does the time go? At the risk of sounding too existential, I’m supposed to be telling you why you’re here, why I’m here, and how the Writers Guild will change your life.” I raised a defiant eyebrow. “Or maybe just your Sunday routine. If you really want to write a book, we need to uncover the atman or soul for your writing – the underlying tone that weaves your words together. All you really need is one spark. If it’s real, it will turn into a fire warm enough to cook up an entire book.” His speech was poetic, as is expected of any experienced writer. “I’ll tell you now that it’s going to be a difficult journey. Do you really want to write a book?”
     “I do.” Reconsidering was out of the question. I was already autographing book covers in my mind.
     “Okay. Over the years, I have refined a specific process for successful writing. Are you ready?”
     “I’m your unwritten book.” A creature of routine, the desire to try new things is foreign to me. But I was beginning to see, to my dismay, that I could not write this book without experienced guidance. Writing a book, an act that was supposed to prove my strength, was instead exposing my weaknesses.
     “You and I will meet once a week, though you are welcome here whenever you like. During each of our sessions, I will ask you to write a short piece about some aspect of your life, positive or negative, trivial or profound, significant or negligible. As we go through this exercise, we’ll uncover the fundamental soul that is the premise of your novel. You will then be equipped to craft your novel in its entirety.”
     “Charles, this sounds wonderful, and when you are dealing with someone accomplished, this would make perfect sense.” He opened his mouth to respond but I continued, “You’ll quickly see that my life is not exciting. Every vignette will be insignificant. You need to help me write something exhilarating – controversial, poignant, and intellectual. Like that science fiction novel of yours.” I thought for a moment, “The operating word here is fiction.”
     “Sabena, do you think I went to Mars before writing a book about aliens? All of it, every notion, written or unwritten, comes from right up here,” he said, tapping his forehead. “The world in my mind is nothing but the meaning I find in the world around me.” I wished I could borrow his brain. It was what I needed to complete the book I wanted to write.
     “I just don’t know if this will work – if this will get me where I want to be.”  
     “It will, because our relationship automatically turns you into a writer.”
     “What do you mean?”
     “Think about it. I am going to get to know you through your writing, the same way that most of your readers will. They won’t know you like your friends.”
     “Sure, that’s true.”
     “One of the most important things to remember as a writer is that most of your readers will never meet you in person. Your words need to come to life when a reader sets his eyes on them.”
     “But we just talked about how I shouldn’t worry about pleasing my readers.” He scrunched his nose and nodded.
     “It’s a balancing act. Above all, you should not be writing for anyone but yourself.”     
     “How did you master all these rules? Who was your Charles?”
     “Practice, Sabena. Practice and experience.” Like a child, I wished I could snap once and become a grown up. “Sabena, I want to know more about your job. What makes you so passionate about technology, especially after studying psychology? More passionate than, say, my job sitting and writing all day?”
     “Well –“
     “Uh-uh-uh,” he shook his head as he typed on an imaginary keyboard in the air. “You’re a writer. I’d rather read about your passion than hear about it. This can be the first piece of our writer-reader relationship.” It was an abrupt ending to our conversation, but I was in no place to question Charles’s tactics. I started to type:
 
     Last year, as a part of a company-wide wellness initiative, I needed to complete an on-site blood test. To say blood makes me queasy would be an understatement. After fasting for twelve hours beforehand, I went in for my appointment. A volunteer seated me in a chair across from a nurse who gave me an icy stare.
     She started pressing the veins on my arms and hands. “How much water did you drink this morning?” She may have been asking, but it sounded like scolding. My heart pounded. 
     “Um...I don't know...like a couple water bottles.” She wrinkled her brow.
     “I can’t find your vein. How big was the water bottle?” Without warning she inserted a needle into my hand. Not my arm, but my hand. Shooting pain accompanied. 
     “Oh, you're already starting? I wanted to look away. I can't look at this. I don't know. The bottle was maybe eight or um...” My world started spinning. “I think I'm going to faint,” I told her as I watched blood dribble like molasses from hand to test tube.
     “Stop moving!How much water did you drink today?”     
     “I think I'm going to faint,” I repeated. Frustrated, she pulled the needle out of my hand and looked at me.
     “Do you want to go lie against that wall?” I responded that I needed water. I could feel my body becoming warm; the world was spinning. With a look that said, “Getting you water is not in my job description,"" the nurse reluctantly departed in search of some. But before doing so, she pawned me off to another nurse: “Go sit in that chair. He'll draw your blood.”
     I moved to the new chair and waited nervously. Finally, it was my turn again.
     “Oh, here's a really good vein.” The nurse pressed firmly on my arm. “Now if you want to look away, I'm going to start.” I looked away. He continued talking. “Did I hear you say you were going to faint before?”  I nodded. “Well I’m not surprised.I tend to have that effect on women.” I managed to smile. “Don’t worry. You’re anxious and uncomfortable. It’s a natural reaction. And there we go, we're done!” I couldn’t believe that the torture was already over – I didn’t realize when it started.
     For weeks after my blood test, I thought about my disparate experiences with the two nurses. The male nurse's compassion, empathy, and sense of humor made him perfect for soothing the discomfort of a needle. And the first nurse's unconcern made her a poor fit. She would be a marvelous prison guard. You can’t plug a person into any occupation and expect success.  
     I am often asked how I keep up in the tech world when I studied psychology. My response is simple: I have always been passionate about technology. When I was choosing a post-graduate job, I knew that as long as I continued to interact with other humans, I would be able to apply my major no matter where I went or what I did. A profound understanding of human psychology -- the ability to connect with others at a deep level, to attribute their behaviors to situations over disposition, and to break down barriers built by cognitive biases -- ensures success in any environment, from drawing blood to building computer software. 
     That first nurse was bad at her job because she lacked fundamental interpersonal skills. She couldn’t connect. While she seemed to have decided on a whim to be a nurse, my choice to join a role in tech was no accident. As our world becomes increasingly powered by technology, our biggest challenge will be to maintain a deep understanding of that technology’s end-users: other humans. No matter the job description. If you ask me, this is why the path from psychology to technology, though unconventional, is completely necessary.
 






     It took me an hour to craft this piece after which I turned my laptop around so the screen was facing Charles, who was working on his own draft. He

looked up and I signaled to my computer. I needed Charles’s assessment of my writing so I could calibrate my idea of “great writing” with his, then figure out how to make my writing “great” in his eyes.

<div class=""full-description"">
<p><strong>Hi there! I'm Mindy Kay Smith- the Thoroughly Modern Mommy.</strong> <strong>And this is a project about teaching women through honesty, humor, and hope that they are not alone. </strong>(alliteration intentional.)</p>
<p>My Curriculum Vitae says I'm a performing arts teacher. When I get paid to work, it's generally in that area. But several years ago, after an unsuccessful year of trying to get pregnant, I started to write. I wrote down the story of our journey in trying to conceive (or TTC for those of you visiting from that world. I'm sorry you're in that world, by the way. I hope we can make it a little easier together.) The most tangible result was a now-finished, ready-to-send-to-agents memoir. I'm hoping that one day in the not-so-distant future I can send you the link to buy it on Amazon. But in the meantime...</p>
<p>The other result was realizing I had a love for writing.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.thrlymdrnmommy.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ThrlyMdrnMommy.blogspot.com</a> is where I've been developing that love, and my craft.</strong></p>
<p>I've been writing on my blog since my daughter was a few months old. Sometimes it was as close to adult interaction as I could get while we waited for Daddy to come home. I wrote because it helped me.</p>
<p>It turns out that I was also helping others.</p>
<p>I used my blog as an outlet to share my daily struggles and victories as a Mom. I also shared experiences with infertility, mental illness, and adoption.</p>
<p>And it started to get attention.</p>
<p>Over the past month, I've done a few interviews and gotten a few more followers and realized- it's time to make this thing big. I want to reach as many people as I can. I want to let them know they're not alone. And I want them to laugh. With me, at me, whatever.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://ThoroughlyModernMommy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ThoroughlyModernMommy.com</a> will be different.</strong></p>
<p>There are a million sites out there dealing with infertility, and parenthood, and adoption, and depression. This one will be different in four ways.</p>
<p>1. My blogs address the topics with both sensitivity and humor. I've seen one or the other. Having them together is rare.</p>
<p>2. I'll include resources for people looking for help. Note: I will not be providing this help myself. I am not a doctor. I am not a therapist.

<p>I'm a Mom. If you've gotten this far down the page (thank you!) you probably picked that up by now.

Sure.</p></div>","Hi there! I'm Mindy Kay Smith- the Thoroughly Modern Mommy. And this is a project about teaching women through honesty, humor, and hope that they are not alone. (alliteration intentional.)
My Curriculum Vitae says I'm a performing arts teacher. When I get paid to work, it's generally in that area. But several years ago, after an unsuccessful year of trying to get pregnant, I started to write. I wrote down the story of our journey in trying to conceive (or TTC for those of you visiting from that world. I'm sorry you're in that world, by the way. I hope we can make it a little easier together.) The most tangible result was a now-finished, ready-to-send-to-agents memoir. I'm hoping that one day in the not-so-distant future I can send you the link to buy it on Amazon. But in the meantime...
The other result was realizing I had a love for writing.
ThrlyMdrnMommy.blogspot.com is where I've been developing that love, and my craft.
I've been writing on my blog since my daughter was a few months old. Sometimes it was as close to adult interaction as I could get while we waited for Daddy to come home. I wrote because it helped me.
It turns out that I was also helping others.
I used my blog as an outlet to share my daily struggles and victories as a Mom. I also shared experiences with infertility, mental illness, and adoption.
And it started to get attention.
Over the past month, I've done a few interviews and gotten a few more followers and realized- it's time to make this thing big. I want to reach as many people as I can. I want to let them know they're not alone. And I want them to laugh. With me, at me, whatever.
ThoroughlyModernMommy.com will be different.
There are a million sites out there dealing with infertility, and parenthood, and adoption, and depression. This one will be different in four ways.
1. My blogs address the topics with both sensitivity and humor. I've seen one or the other. Having them together is rare.
2. I'll include resources for people looking for help. Note: I will not be providing this help myself. I am not a doctor. I am not a therapist. I am just a person who unfortunately had to learn a lot about these topics. I will not attempt to give you answers to your personal situation. But I will list straight-forward information. Terms about infertility. Different types of adoptions. Help lines if you're in crisis.
3. This site will NOT include an online community. I know these communities are helpful for many. But I also know that sometimes you just want to know what kind of pregnancy test is best without hearing 27 stories from strangers about the bizarre things that worked for them.
4. When it comes to infertility, adoption, and depression, I am no longer ""in it."" I will always be a person who suffers from depression, but have been healthy for a long time. I will always hurt from infertility, but am no longer actively trying to conceive. I will be a part of an adoptive family forever, but am no longer going through the process. This is an important difference, because it allows me to focus on telling stories and relaying information.
So, what's the money for?
I want to make ThoroughlyModernMommy.com the fun, inviting site that Moms deserve. This means a great web designer. A talented graphic artist. Marketing campaigns. And equipment that can handle all that. (I'm writing this to you live from my acer aspire one.)
Thank you for taking the time to read all this. I welcome any questions or comments you have about ThoroughlyModernMommy.com
But in the meantime- it's beautiful outside! Go do something fun!

Canadian Journalists for Free Expression (CJFE) is a Canadian organization that works to defend and
protect the right to free expression in Canada and around the world. CJFE monitors, defends and reports on free expression and access to information in Canada and abroad. Rooted in the field of journalism, we promote a free media as essential to a fair and open society. CJFE boldly champions the free expression rights of all people, and encourages and supports individuals and groups in the protection of their own and others' free expression rights.Visit our website to learn more about our work to protect free expression in Canada and abroad. What is the Review?Every year on World Press Freedom Day (May 3), we publish our Review of Free Expression in Canada. It is the ONLY publication of
its kind in Canada that:


Provides a report card grading free expression
in Canada.


Holds government, institutions, businesses, and
society as a whole responsible for their impact on freedom of expression in
Canada.


Looks at the nation’s most pressing issues of
free expression in the past year.


Analyzes the results of major court cases.

Examines trends, breakthroughs and obstacles.
This past year has been significant and challenging for free
expression in Canada. From the Snowden leaks to the TPP negotiations, Bill
C-461 to the silencing of Canadian scientists, and with countless attacks on journalists and protesters around the world, publications like our annual Review are needed now, more than ever.Over the
past five years, the media has been able to make Canadians aware of how much their access to information, their right to be informed on issues of major importance, has been eroded. But this is just the tip of the iceberg, as governments and the private sector withhold the kind of information that we all need to make informed decisions. CJFE is the only organization in Canada that consistently holds those in authority accountable by drawing public attention to the
determined efforts to withhold information.
This year, we are on a mission to make the Review
better than ever before. We want to report on more efforts to suppress what should be public information, we want to reach a broader audience, and strengthen CJFE so that we can contribute to a more transparent political and business environment.Click on the links below to view previous issues of the Review:

<p> </p>
<p>I'm Hazel West, a self-published author of five novels including <em>A Case of Poisons</em> which is the novel of interest here. I'm also the author of <em>On a Foreign Field</em> which is 5 star rated on Amazon and Goodreads and <em>By Blood or By Bond</em> my last published novel about Roman Britain.</p>
<p>What is <em>A Case of Poisons </em> about?</p>
<p><em>Anthony Maxwell is a private investigator, a consultant for the mostly incompetent inspectors at Scotland Yard, on occasion a writer, and always a lover of coffee. He has been working small cases for several years to pay the bills when he’s introduced to the first multiple murder case of his career early one morning, when a witness catches a man trying to unload a body to bury in a nearby graveyard. Soon the first body is joined by three more in the course of a single morning and Anthony knows this is no ordinary serial murder case. And why is the murderer targeting beggars and urchin children? If that wasn’t cause enough to worry, all the victims are covered with horrible wounds and show signs of exotic poisoning. Anthony, along with his partners Tobias—an ex-broadsman and well-know charmer—and Scamp—a street smart and talented young woman—work to find out who is murdering the helpless beggars and children in such horrifying ways. The first book in this new Victorian steampunk series takes the three companions to the limits of their abilities as they go up against canny murderers, bruisers who appear invincible, anarchist groups, and even ancient British royalty in the biggest case Anthony Maxwell has ever worked in his career.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This campaign is to help fun the production and promotion of my newest book, the first in a Victorian steampunk mystery series chronicling the adventurous cases of my private detective Anthony Maxwell. It's an action-packed series, narrated by the witty and gentlemanly Anthony and is kind of a cross between Sherlock Holmes and The Three Musketeers with a steampunk flair added. What I'm raising money for is mostly promotional: I want to do a long blog tour to get the series out to potential readers, and other promotional things like giveaways and advertisement. Every time I publish a book, I try to do a little more to get it out, and being a self-published author is hard because I have to do all promotion myself, finding blog spots and paying for advertisement out of pocket. I'm not going to lie, indie authors are almost always starving artists, at least until we can sell enough books to make up the difference of how much we pay to produce them. What I really want at the end of the day, is for people to enjoy my books, but in order for them to be able to find them, promotional steps need to be taken so a wider audience of people will have the chance to read them.</p>
<p>In short, I can't do what I want without YOUR help! Even if you pledge $5, that's a huge help toward my goal. In today's social media, it's so easy to spread the word without costing people much, if anything at all. </p>
<p>I'm hoping to raise $800 (and in that is the cost of all perks you will receive if you donate as well!) But even if I don't make that amount, every little bit will help. This is a breakdown of where the money will go:</p>
<p>A long virtual book tour</p>
<p>Buying copies for giveaways</p>
<p>Printing costs for bookmarks and posters for promotion and giveaways</p>
<p>Advertisement </p>
<p>A domain for an official author website</p>
<p>If I end up having more money than what I planned for, everything that is left will go toward the production of the next novel I publish, so in reality, all this money will provide something for fans and potential readers even more than me. I'm looking forward to the satisfaction of people enjoying my book. Anthony Maxwell is a character I fell in love with, and everyone who has read him so far (and not just family members, mind!) have also loved him, so I'm really excited about the start of this series. To begin with, it's my first series, and on top of that, I think it's the kind of book everyone will enjoy. There's something in it for readers of all ages.</p>
<p>Extra money might also go to coffee if I get really desperate-can't write without that.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now for the perks (I know this is the part you've all been waiting for)</p>
<p>I've got some fun thank you gifts for people who contribute. Here's a breakdown of what you'll receive for helping out:</p>
<p>$5- a signed bookmark</p>
<p>$10- an ebook copy of <em>A Case of Poisons</em> in your choice of format</p>
<p>$25- a signed paperback copy of <em>A Case of Poisons</em> and a bookmark</p>
<p>$50- signed paperback, ebook, and a signed poster with the cover art</p>
<p>$75- a signed paperback, ebook, poster, and (here's the exciting part) you get to name a character for the next book</p>
<p>$100- a signed paperback, a lovely pocket watch (<a href=""http://www.gentlemansemporium.com/store/003895.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.gentlemansemporium.com/store/003895.php</a>) and naming a character for the next book.</p>
<p>All contributers will be mentioned in the acknowledgements of the second Anthony Maxwell mystery <em>Street Arab's Ruse</em> which should be out in 2014. </p>
<p>Also as a note, every book comes with a bookmark, just in case you were wondering.</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>I hope you'll all consider contributing, but if you can't contribute at the time, you can still help by spreading the word. Tell your friends! Remember, the social network gets word around faster than anything, and spreading the word a little at a time still helps. Give me a tweet, or post on Facebook; if you do contribute, do the same thing! My whole goal for this fund is to get the word out, so we may as well start now! If you follow the links on my profile, you can find me on Twitter, Goodreads, my blog, and also follow Anthony's facebook page. Just remember that every little bit you do, whether it's contributing money, or just helping to spread the word, it will all be a huge help in the end, and I want to see Anthony enjoyed by other people as much as I have enjoyed writing him. And if I have a bunch of fans waiting for book two, then hey, I guess I did something right!</p>

It includes the stories of not only myself and the changes I went through, from

all need to be at better terms with in our lives.</span></p>
<p>This is all a story that happened twenty years ago. A potential
lifetime for many. But the wink of an eye as you age. </p>
<p>Please know this is not my first time to engage the writing and
publishing of a book. I have a couple out now. My most recent is titled; <b><a href=""http://melzabel.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Meditation. It's not what you think.</a></b> </p>
<p>To say the least I've had a very transformative couple decades in
my life. Before I can own my present, I have to also own my past. The
publication of this book will free me to openly take credit for it during an
interview should it come up as I speak of meditation and spirituality. </p>
<p>Yes, I've even changed my name slightly. Not to hide from the
past, but to embrace this new chapter in my life. My name is Melvin Edward
Zabel. I simply dropped Ed off a few years ago as I began to teach and write

 This is not you're typical collection of fetish related images.
It includes the stories of not only myself and the changes I went through, from
my complete innocence of the topic to the ending, as I changed toward becoming
who and what I am today. The underlying message is about change. Something we
all need to be at better terms with in our lives.
This is all a story that happened twenty years ago. A potential
lifetime for many. But the wink of an eye as you age. 
Please know this is not my first time to engage the writing and
publishing of a book. I have a couple out now. My most recent is titled; Meditation. It's not what you think. 
To say the least I've had a very transformative couple decades in
my life. Before I can own my present, I have to also own my past. The
publication of this book will free me to openly take credit for it during an
interview should it come up as I speak of meditation and spirituality. 
Yes, I've even changed my name slightly. Not to hide from the
past, but to embrace this new chapter in my life. My name is Melvin Edward
Zabel. I simply dropped Ed off a few years ago as I began to teach and write
about meditation. 
This publication is my own freedom from my own kind of bondage. 
Not only did I live this chapter in my life. But I was able
transform myself back out of it again. 
My next book's working title is; Bridge of Change.
A book about this specific topic. But I need to get this one out
first. Although I am being boastful in my presentation, it was all nothing more
than a chapter in the book of my life. 
I've changed considerably in the past few years.

</div></div>","La prima antologia del Varco Chi conosce il movimento sa quanto, in questi mesi, ci siamo impegnati a raccogliere in giro per l'Italia personalità preparate, in grado di scrivere e tirar fuori testi dalla forte pregnanza emotiva ed intellettuale. Abbiamo deciso di radunarli in un'antologia che conterrà: 

Racconti e poesie edite e inedite dei membri del Varco


Fotografie e dipinti dei nostri artisti


Saggi sulla società contemporanea


Per noi è la chance di produrre un'opera vera, cartacea, reale e finanziata dalle persone che ci seguono e che credono in questo progetto. Un'opera giovane che può permettere a tanti aspiranti autori e artisti di compiere il primo vero passo della loro carriera.
L'antologia, dal titolo provvisorio ""L'aria che tira - Antologia del Varco"", sarà divisa in quattro capitoli: quattro finestre sul mondo contemporaneo, quattro chiavi di lettura della realtà vista con gli occhi dei giovani italiani, quattro aree tematiche per esplorare la poetica e la sensibilità dei nostri autori.



Il senso di isolamento e il paradosso della nostalgia, la lontananza e la vicinanza da sé stessi, dall'amore, da un sogno, dalla vita.


La figura della donna, esplorata nella sua indipendenza, nella sua solitudine, ma anche nella sua sessualità e centralità nella meta-pornografica società odierna.


Il rifiuto della vita e l'abbandono di ogni speranza, il senso di nodo alla gola che precede la disperazione dopo aver perso l'anima.

Il tramonto dell'Occidente visto attraverso i racconti grotteschi e disumani di esistenze meccaniche sull'orlo della nuova era.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>Hidden Curriculum </i>explores educational inequality by interrogating the ""hidden curriculum,"" the collection of norms, knowledge and behaviors that are rewarded in the American educational system. The book explores how this curriculum is learned (or not), how it can reinforce and create barriers for underrepresented students, and how these dynamics influence students' sense of belonging and achievement. In particular, I'm exploring the role of youth development  organizations in teaching, translating, and shaping the hidden curriculum to students who might not otherwise learn it. <br/><br/>My name is Andrew Maguire and I am the author of <i>Hidden Curriculum</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to tell the story of youth development organizations' efforts to decode the hidden curriculum, something that remains overlooked and under-recognized.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that there is in fact a hidden curriculum in America and that the manifestation of that curriculum reinforces barriers to equal education for underrepresented students. I hope it offers an opportunity for reflection, whether you are an administrator of a youth development organization, a young person navigating these institutions, or a community member eager to fight for a more inclusive society. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about educational inequality and the challenging dynamics it raises in youth development work. You'll hear stories such as...<ul>
<li>The efforts by one young educator to reform public speaking trainings to harness the lived experiences and unique voices of young students of color</li>
<li>The successes and struggles of young alumni of prestigious college prep and academic enrichment programs</li>
<li>The inclusive approach of one college prep organization in Chicago to build positive racial and ethnic identity among middle school students with high academic potential. </li>
</ul> <i>Hidden Curriculum </i>is a nonfiction book that speaks to anyone that wants to look at education in a new way. <br/> <h3>The Book - <i>Hidden Curriculum</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. These chapters will orient readers both to the idea of the hidden curriculum and to different models in youth development. </li>
<li>Part 2 contains chapters 4-7. In this part, I’ll dig into the ways the hidden curriculum shows up in the college admissions process, the development of a college-going culture, and in both the academic and social spheres on college campuses. </li>
<li>Part 3 contains chapters 8-11 + the conclusion. Here I’ll illustrate four prevailing tensions in the work of youth development organizations and reflect on how they can best support young people in unlocking life-changing opportunities.<br/> </li>
</ul>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August 2021.</li>
<li>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>

<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this in Spring 2021</li>
</ul> <strong>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. </strong><br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>

to write another novel, but was drawn into a quest  for a treasure which had  brought cycles  of  destruction down on the once populous town,
most recently when many buildings were dynamited by prospectors after  the treasure, in the immediate post revolutionary
period. The town was old even in European terms, and dated back to the
late  15<sup>th</sup> century,  if not before. Only the cathedral had
escaped unscathed,  but housed darker secrets, and was built on an ancient mound, indicating
the  importance of the site long before the Spanish Conquest of Mexico.
The  only way in was by a mile long  tunnel, hewn through a mountain peak, one of three which
concealed the town from the world. From
the high chapparal  far below,  the conical mountains loomed like  three
witches hats, and their native names,  suggested a connection to an ancient
legend, concerning a sacred  garden  and a mythical treasure 
that had been sought for thousands of years, from both sides of the
Atlantic. 
</p><p>That quest, how I got out of it and  lived to tell the tale, and my  researches  into
the background of the  legendary
‘Treasure of the Sierra Madre, formed the basis of  this novel. </p>

 'A little bus, ascends a cobbled road towards a pueblo fantasmos...'  The  Mexican pueblo
fantasmos where I lived for about a year and which provided the setting for much of
this tale,  is a real place, but
shall remain nameless. I had gone there
to write another novel, but was drawn into a quest  for a treasure which had  brought cycles  of  destruction down on the once populous town,

Atlantic. 
That quest, how I got out of it and  lived to tell the tale, and my  researches  into
the background of the  legendary
‘Treasure of the Sierra Madre, formed the basis of  this novel. 
 But first I had write the other story 
-  why I came to the town in the
first place.  
 (WHO IS WILL LORIMER? PART #1....)Though  completing the novel was
a personal breakthrough, unfortunately its publication  coincided with an
Australian media  magnate taking a major stake in my London publishers. The novel  was a satirical
account of a journey across Australian Outback, and in it I returned the traditional Aussie  welcome extended to 'poms' in spades.  Perhaps the  new owner didn’t get
the joke, but  for  whatever  reason the launch party was
cancelled at the last minute, and my novel was never reviewed, or 
distributed, other than to a few bookshops in Notting  Hill near the offices of the publishing
company. Even so the  first and last edition sold well and more
importantly went on to become at

compliment, considering what that  media magnate and his ilk  stands
for. But though the rejections  piled up in  the years
following,  I kept writing, and plotting my
revenge.  (More on that  in WHO IS WILL LORIMER #2.)
I have recently rewritten the story.  It is one of  three novels
which my putative publishing empire of Inkistan.com, will  issue after the
'Ghost Who Wouldn't Give up is published in early May. 
Here are the  covers of those three novels.   And this one is a real... and this one is the last for now...  If the campaign surpasses the  goal of funding a Spanish Language e- and print book, the  excess will go towards the editing costs of the other three novels, and establishing inkistan.com as a fiercely  independent publishing imprint.'A little bus, ascends a cobbled road towards a pueblo fantasmos...'  Yea, ok, enough of that for the moment. You want to know about  all those marvellous rewards  I went to perkistan to create for  you.  I shall call this next section 'PHANTASTIC PERKS' (thanks John)The ultimate perk is this artwork which  features on the cover of 'The Ghost Who Wouldn't Give Up'. The skull was inspired by the  Art of Ancient Mexico. A note about the exotic glass which facets the outside and  the inside of  the skull.  This is a special dichroic glass which I was granted the 
exclusive use of by  the company which manufactured it. The company no 
longer exists. The glass which is coated with layers of gold, platinium and other  precious metals  was designed for use in deep space and, depending 
on the  point of view, splits the light into complimentary colours, and a
 mirror phase. It is  99.9% reflective, which is approximately 10% more 
than conventional mirror.  This next artwork  and video has a poem to go with it:Just an old stone god/ a plastic reproduction actually/ the son of a son/ last of a line/like me actually/ plastic/ yet retaining form/ in contemporary society.


The penultimate perk, 'The Skull of 
Time'  is, as the name suggests,  about Time - our perpetual enemy that 
never sleeps, or rests, and is always  marking down our days in 
incremental ticks. In the Ghost  Who Wouldn't Give Up,  the Cathedral 
bell tolls 13 at midday and  midnight, reminding the population of 
the pueblo fantasmos that time in the Town  is organized according to 
the Aztec system - thirteen hours for  the day, and thirteen at night. . The Skull of Time revolves and can be used  for divination. Yes, no  or maybe, depending on which way the skull ends up after it's given a spin. It is a very handy skull, given all the question life poses on a daily basis. . The next perk,  Bob the Demon, is named  after a character  we meet in the Aztec Underworld of Mictlan in The Ghost Who Wouldn't Give Up. The sculpture is  constructed from ebony,  a fast food container,  and dichroic glass. Achieve instant fame with this next perk and  be an instant celebrity, on the catwalk, on the beach,  clothed or unclothed. Wearing just these
unique designer sunglasses customized by the author, you'll command attention
wherever you are. This next perk, The Star of Inkistan Medal, is only   awarded for outstanding contributions to the  Republic of Ink.  Only 1 medal  will be awarded. The recipient  will be elevated to the rank of  Knight Commander of Inkistan,   the Highest  Order of the Republic of Ink. Knights  of Inkistan are charged with protecting  the Republic from media  Corporations.  A certificate  of authenticity accompanies  this  medal. The next perk 'Temple in Inkistan' is in the characteristic  style of the folk art of

It is  both an invocation of divine inspiration  and a talisman protecting against lightning, which  in the Tartas Mountains of Inkistan is a common occurrence.   Continuing the Mexican/Inkistan themed perks. Next on offer are 2 deamonkins. The one on the left, is Mexican, and the one on the right Inkistan. They are very friendly demons and bestow luck on whoever wears them.  The Mexican deamonkin is a pendant and the Inkistan deamonkin a brooch. Despite their different provenance, they are a pair. 
Because this novel, is partly about Doubles,’ my first perk, like all the

I have been studying philosophy, religion, and spirituality 
independently for about twelve years now. Over the years, my journey has
 taken me down many paths, including pantheism, Taoism, Zen, Hegelian 
dialectic, eclecticism, Hindu and Buddhist traditions, and many more.
In ""Light & Logic,"" I will finally reveal the startling results 
of my long quest to unite Western rationality with Eastern mysticism. In
 its pages, the reader will be skillfully guided through the opposing 
ideas and arguments which have occupied my mind for over a decade - as 
well as their resolutions.
Tackling the Tough Questions in New Ways
In the book, readers will discover:
What ""God"" is (and isn't), and how to ""find God"" through the only 
path consistent with rational thinking (and you'll never guess what this
 path is).
How two unwieldy and obscure words, ""transcendental noncognitivism,"" can forever change your view of reality and spirituality.
What logic really is, and the logical limitations of logic. How and 
why it's logical to go beyond logic, and more importantly, when.
Why we're here, according to the only line of reasoning that can 
withstand every challenge. You can read this in the ancient Vedic texts,
 but not in simple English.
The simplest and most universal code of ethics, consistent with both
 rationality and spirituality - and how to apply it. Hint: it's not the 
Golden Rule.
The two key aspects of authentic spiritual practice - and neither 
one involves going to church or trying to ""convert"" anyone to your 
beliefs.
A totally new view of the human soul without the many philosophical 
and scientific problems of previous models. You'll be shocked at how 
much sense this makes.
The nature of intuition, its relation to space, time, and ultimate 
reality, and how it can be compatible with rational thought (if 
correctly approached).
Logical truth about the ""afterlife,"" death, and other end-of-life 
questions. Did you know you'll never be dead? If not, you need to read 
this chapter.
The true nature of the ego and its real extent and influence in 
daily life. Many writers don't get anywhere near the truth of this, and 
it's essential.
The true nature of consciousness - what it is, and what this 
knowledge means to you. How to conceptualize (and better yet, 
de-conceptualize) consciousness.
The role of every skeptic's least favorite word, ""faith,"" in 
spiritual thought and practice - and how to embrace a faith that doesn't
