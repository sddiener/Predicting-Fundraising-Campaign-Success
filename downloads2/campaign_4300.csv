<h3>The Plan<br/>
</h3>
<div>I am Sarah, a student at Alaska Pacific University. Alaska is a state still rich in its Native traditions, and I have spent 2011 incorporating some of these into our kayaking curriculum for my senior thesis. There is no better way to enhance our kayaking classes than by learning about the very origins of the kayak. Helping us learn is Maligiaq, a local Inuit master boat builder who has already taught many of our students how to roll a kayak in the Inuit tradition. We are asking for your support in implementing a skin-on-frame boat building project for our students. We'll get the full experience from selecting the woods, to constructing the boat, and finally paddling them in Alaska's Prince William Sound. With your help in piloting this 2012 extra curricular project, we could introduce boat building next year as a unique and hands-on window into learning more about Alaska's diverse Native paddling traditions.</div>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>Where the Money Goes</h3>
<p>We are raising funds to build three skin-on-frame kayaks, each made for a different body size so everyone can paddle them. About $1,500 total goes to purchasing materials, and $1,000 per boat pays our local master boat builder for his time with us. That all adds up to $4,500. If we don't reach our goal of $2,000 with indiegogo.com, we will still put the money towards boat building, and keep looking around for other funding sources. It may be that we will have to build only one boat this year instead of three. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our gifts will help <i>you</i> spread the interest about Native kayaking traditions, just like we're working to do. The shirts, hand crafted harpoon throwing sticks, and Inuit-style kayak paddles will definitely start some conversations with your friends, especially if you're a paddling fanatic like we are! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We appreciate your contribution and hope that this project serves as a catalyst for your paddling or woodworking interests. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Rob Otani.  I am a structural engineer, adjunct professor of architecture, builder, and artist. As an avid hobbyist of boatbuilding, I have envisioned the design, fabrication, and installation of the interactive sculpture ""Transformative Kayak"" as a way to combine my interests in boatbuilding, engineering, and architecture for the interests of the patrons of Governor's Island and hopefull contribute to the richness of culture and art created by the Figment organization.  The ""Transformative Kayak"" design has been selected by the Figment organization to be built and exhibited on Governor's Island, New York from June to October of 2011.  I have estimated that the raw material costs and rental costs to build this sculpture as $5,000.  I am reaching out to raise the funds to build this installation.  After the exhibit, the sculpture will be dismantled and the kayaks will be donated to a local school for their use. <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Transformative Kayak sculpture is a beautiful sculpture that will be built solely by volunteers.  Its construction will be a way of teaching friends and students how to work with simple hand tools to create a unique structure.  The transformation of the sculpture is a about the transformation of sustainable materials, exchange of ideas and thoughts, collaboration, and ultimately the donation of the beautiful skin-on-frame kayaks to a local school for the kids to use.  <br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The campaign is targeted to raise $5,000 specifically for the materials of the sculpture.  Some of the funds will be used for rental of equipment and vehicles for transporting the sculpture as well as insurance.  </p>

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"">Short Summary</span></p>
<p><span>For years we’ve provided the community with workshops for adults and kids, encouraging creativity and innovation. We promote art students, emerging and established artists with gallery exhibition space. We develop creative projects and are creative consultants to many artists. Archway 1 Archetype Art Studio is located under a bridge in a viaduct and we have been there for 8 years. Obviously we want to continue doing this, but unfortunately we’ve recently hit a bit of a bump in the road. The neighbour that we were sharing the power with has abruptly disconnected our power! We have been without power for nearly two months and this has distrupted our ability to work and has forced us to temporarily shut down, unfortunately postponing our entire workshop program. We now work by natural light and candlelight as well as freeze our butts off (it's winter in Sydney) all day, every day. So, we need the community to very kindly help us out. </span></p>
<p>We are an artist run space and gallery that does not receive government funding. All our work is on a voluntary basis and we rely on funds from our workshops to keep us going.</p>
<p>Rachel: That's me. I'm one half of the creative directors. I manage all things Archetype Gallery, Archway 1 Archetype Art Studio and the Creative Arts Alliance Sydney. I'm your usual multi-faceted creative person, a filmmaker stemming from a performing arts background. Actor, singer, dancer, choreographer.</p>
<p>Stefan:Is the other half of the creative directors. He is an artist; painter, writer, photographer, filmmaker. He takes great portraits of dogs, in our local area and had an exhibition and book launch recently from his body of work, titled <strong>Park Life</strong>. <em>The video link provided here, is from that launch and gives you an idea of just some of what we do.</em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span>We’re fighting to get the power turned on again, but in the mean time we’re left with no choice but to buy a generator. </span><strong>Operation Power Up</strong> is to raise funds to get our power back on asap, and an electrician to hook up our entire studio inclusive of our workstations. The 2.6kVa 4 stroke digital generator can power up our entire place and our electrical equipment and appliances. The cost of the generator is $1595, the electrician cost is the balance.</p>
<p>Power is essential for us to get back to what we do best, provide creative and artistic avenues for everybody. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our intended goal, then we will sell lemonade, continue to save our pennies, make up the difference and buy a generator, however this could be months away.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are a team of volunteers, that love what we do. Our regular students; children between 1 and 12 years, are waiting for our workshops to resume again. Some kids came into the studio recently, ignored the dark and freezing cold and just started drawing and painting! That demonstrates how important accessing our creative space means to the little ones in the local community. </p>
<p>Your contribution to our fundraiser will guarantee you a place in our hearts. Every contributor will go on our website page as a sponsor and the Archway 1 Archetype Art Studio community will know that you helped us in <strong>Operation Power Up</strong>, to enable their favourite local arts space and gallery to be open and operational, for them.</p>
<p>This is our first ever online fundraising campaign, so we are excited!</p>
<p>If you're a local, drop in for a cup of coffee or tea and if you're somewhere else in the world, feel free to check out our website and get in touch to enquire further or email us to just say ""hey"".</p>

<p></p><p>And so a work of art in honour, in service to the gods and in service to the divine heart of each of us, is begun.</p><p>An Oracle deck – a work of art that is handled, spoken to, listened to – and a book of their stories and rituals together to bring the gods in their many forms, male, female, androgyne, into our lives. They come to show us that we too are sacred and that all the people of the world, regardless of sex or gender or race, are divine too.</p><p>Healing Hearts is an Oracle Deck which includes male, female and third-gendered deities from cultures all over the world, to allow us to meet the divine in its many faces and heal our relationship to the divine masculine, feminine and androgyne in our lives, within and without.</p><p>It is also a detailed book detailing the stories and history of each deity within the deck with rituals and devotionals to help you listen to their words directly, useful when paired with the deck but equally helpful on its own for those that prefer books to decks. In order to make this really awesome I’ve asked my friend Pawl to help with the research!</p><p><b>We still get any funds pledged if we don't hit our target, and will use every penny towards making this deck - it will just take a lot longer to do :)</b></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/433796/files/20140314105942-Forest_River_Watermarked.jpg?1394819982"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><b>What We Need &amp;
What You Get</b></p>
<p>All funds raised will go towards covering three important areas, in this
order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Materials and creation of
     perks (£300)</li>
<li>Printing an initial run of
     decks (£200)</li>
<li>Time to dedicate exclusively
     to this project (£500)</li>
</ul><p>And then covering IndieGoGo fees! Any funds
over the initial goal will be split between further time (as it will take longer than 10 days!), marketing and further
printing costs.</p>
<p>All money
earned for time spent on this project will go towards funding my PhD and career
as an undercover Enchantress in academia (and paying my lovely researcher,
Pawl!) starting with a trip to present my first aesthetics paper, on the
experience of the artist as part of nature, which will kick-start my path to
changing some minds!</p>
<p>In return
for helping Healing Hearts you can get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original art, commissions or
     prints, to honour your favourite deity at home</li>
<li>Signed copies of a unique
     deck in its first edition</li>
<li>A guidebook to the stories
     of the gods, complete with devotional rituals</li>
<li>A Deck that includes a card
     just for you, illuminating your divinity!</li>
<li>Oracle readings to shed
     light on your life</li>
<li>To honour your favourite
     deity with a commissioned painting</li>
</ul><p>You also
get the satisfaction of supporting both a deck which strives to heal the world,
one reading at a time AND a woman diving into a traditionally male-dominated
field in order to bring an under-represented area (Pagan theology and
enchantment) into Philosophy.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/433797/files/20140314110002-Water_Blessings_Watermarked.jpg?1394820002"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><br/><p></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Art Heals. Card decks are artworks that get
interacted with, handled, listened to. Oracles are methods of allowing the gods
to speak directly to us. The proliferation of awesome Goddess decks gives us a
way of meeting the divine feminine whatever level of experience we have, but
what of young pagan males? Or third-gendered pagan newbies? Where can they see
the faces of the Divine that look like them? Where can they find the role
models that show them they belong too? Through the stories. And so to bring the
stories into an Oracle deck brings these faces into relationship with the feminine
faces in a way that shows people of all levels that they too are reflected in
the Divine.</p>
<p>Not only that, but we each contain shades of all
genders, one way or another, to one degree or another. Here is a way we can
find our inner divine in all <i>its</i>
faces and heal our relationships to those parts of ourselves.</p>
<p>Healing starts in the heart. With every card
listened to, every story heard, every face seen, every reading where the Great
Divine flows through us I believe that we heal a part of the world. In the gods
we find role models that include kind men that are strong, victorious women that are nurturing mothers, and cross-gendered people who walk without fear. </p>
<p>My qualifications? I’ve been painting the gods and crafting Oracle
decks since I first found tarot and paganism aged ten. I even self-published a
faery Oracle deck two years ago. Most of my personal work is devotional and I’ve
been a Priestess and teacher within the creative, ecstatic tradition of Reclaiming
Witchcraft for almost a decade. I love bringing the gods to earth and healing through art!</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/433799/files/20140314110102-Leaping_Watermarked.jpg?1394820062"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><br/><p></p>

<p></p><p>The Enchantress shares three moments:</p><p><i>Paint dripped down the page as I stepped back, to see a face of the divine peering back at me. It spoke.</i></p><p><i>Cards fell from fingers, faces of the feminine divine laid out before us as we heard their words spoken with reverence. I wondered where the masculine was.</i></p><p><i>The Green Goddess, the Horned God and the Sacred Earth spoke to us from their seats through our Priest and Priestesses. They called us to honour our hearts and the hearts of those around us.</i></p><p>Image and word in cards combine. The divine ones speak to us. In many forms they gift us with their guidance. Their stories light our way, bring healing to our hearts. Their many, many forms and faces reach out to us and stand before us as role models for our lives, as guides to the Sacred in our own Hearts, showing us where their powers reside in us and in the world.</p><p><i>And so a work of art in honour of and in service to the gods and the divine heart of each of us, is begun.</i></p><p><i>An Oracle Deck and Book full of divine beings, their stories and their healing magic to bless your life and heal the world.</i></p><p>This project is a part of A World Enchanted, the home of myself (Halo), and thus is supporting my pursuit of a PhD in philosophy of art and enchantment in order to bring the importance of magic into an academic, philosophical framework. Enchantment requires living as part of the natural world, not above it, and by welcoming the many forms of the divine into the world through art I am helping to open the possibility for more individuals to recognise their place within the circle.</p><p>I am artist, philosopher, storyteller, enchantress. I welcome you to fly with me into this realm of wonder and help to re-enchant the world!<br/><br/>Happy Thoughts,</p><p>~ Hayley 'Haloquin' Addis</p><br/><p></p></div>","What is Healing

And so a work of art in honour, in service to the gods and in service to the divine heart of each of us, is begun.An Oracle deck – a work of art that is handled, spoken to, listened to – and a book of their stories and rituals together to bring the gods in their many forms, male, female, androgyne, into our lives. They come to show us that we too are sacred and that all the people of the world, regardless of sex or gender or race, are divine too.Healing Hearts is an Oracle Deck which includes male, female and third-gendered deities from cultures all over the world, to allow us to meet the divine in its many faces and heal our relationship to the divine masculine, feminine and androgyne in our lives, within and without.It is also a detailed book detailing the stories and history of each deity within the deck with rituals and devotionals to help you listen to their words directly, useful when paired with the deck but equally helpful on its own for those that prefer books to decks. In order to make this really awesome I’ve asked my friend Pawl to help with the research!We still get any funds pledged if we don't hit our target, and will use every penny towards making this deck - it will just take a lot longer to do :)What We Need &
What You Get
All funds raised will go towards covering three important areas, in this
order:

Materials and creation of
     perks (£300)
Printing an initial run of
     decks (£200)
Time to dedicate exclusively
     to this project (£500)
And then covering IndieGoGo fees! Any funds
over the initial goal will be split between further time (as it will take longer than 10 days!), marketing and further
printing costs.
All money
earned for time spent on this project will go towards funding my PhD and career
as an undercover Enchantress in academia (and paying my lovely researcher,
Pawl!) starting with a trip to present my first aesthetics paper, on the
experience of the artist as part of nature, which will kick-start my path to
changing some minds!
In return
for helping Healing Hearts you can get:

Original art, commissions or
     prints, to honour your favourite deity at home
Signed copies of a unique
     deck in its first edition
A guidebook to the stories
     of the gods, complete with devotional rituals
A Deck that includes a card
     just for you, illuminating your divinity!
Oracle readings to shed
     light on your life
To honour your favourite
     deity with a commissioned painting
You also
get the satisfaction of supporting both a deck which strives to heal the world,
one reading at a time AND a woman diving into a traditionally male-dominated
field in order to bring an under-represented area (Pagan theology and
enchantment) into Philosophy.
The Impact
Art Heals. Card decks are artworks that get
interacted with, handled, listened to. Oracles are methods of allowing the gods
to speak directly to us. The proliferation of awesome Goddess decks gives us a
way of meeting the divine feminine whatever level of experience we have, but
what of young pagan males? Or third-gendered pagan newbies? Where can they see
the faces of the Divine that look like them? Where can they find the role
models that show them they belong too? Through the stories. And so to bring the
stories into an Oracle deck brings these faces into relationship with the feminine
faces in a way that shows people of all levels that they too are reflected in
the Divine.
Not only that, but we each contain shades of all
genders, one way or another, to one degree or another. Here is a way we can
find our inner divine in all its
faces and heal our relationships to those parts of ourselves.
Healing starts in the heart. With every card
listened to, every story heard, every face seen, every reading where the Great
Divine flows through us I believe that we heal a part of the world. In the gods
we find role models that include kind men that are strong, victorious women that are nurturing mothers, and cross-gendered people who walk without fear. 
My qualifications? I’ve been painting the gods and crafting Oracle
decks since I first found tarot and paganism aged ten. I even self-published a
faery Oracle deck two years ago. Most of my personal work is devotional and I’ve
been a Priestess and teacher within the creative, ecstatic tradition of Reclaiming
Witchcraft for almost a decade. I love bringing the gods to earth and healing through art!
Other Ways You Can
Help
I know what it is like to see something awesome but not be able to
contribute financially so I want to share a secret: I’m rubbish at
self-promotion so I really, really need your help in spreading the word. Below

know anyone who fits, please send them this way! If you want to support healing
Hearts, share on social media, write a blogpost, tell your friends.

Thank you for spreading the word, thank you for contributing
and thank you for reading this far!Sketch for an idea for the back of the cards including the powers of water and fire, the sky and the earth, the God, the Goddess and the light of Spirit beyond gender or sex:Original Intro:
The Enchantress shares three moments:Paint dripped down the page as I stepped back, to see a face of the divine peering back at me. It spoke.Cards fell from fingers, faces of the feminine divine laid out before us as we heard their words spoken with reverence. I wondered where the masculine was.The Green Goddess, the Horned God and the Sacred Earth spoke to us from their seats through our Priest and Priestesses. They called us to honour our hearts and the hearts of those around us.Image and word in cards combine. The divine ones speak to us. In many forms they gift us with their guidance. Their stories light our way, bring healing to our hearts. Their many, many forms and faces reach out to us and stand before us as role models for our lives, as guides to the Sacred in our own Hearts, showing us where their powers reside in us and in the world.And so a work of art in honour of and in service to the gods and the divine heart of each of us, is begun.An Oracle Deck and Book full of divine beings, their stories and their healing magic to bless your life and heal the world.This project is a part of A World Enchanted, the home of myself (Halo), and thus is supporting my pursuit of a PhD in philosophy of art and enchantment in order to bring the importance of magic into an academic, philosophical framework. Enchantment requires living as part of the natural world, not above it, and by welcoming the many forms of the divine into the world through art I am helping to open the possibility for more individuals to recognise their place within the circle.I am artist, philosopher, storyteller, enchantress. I welcome you to fly with me into this realm of wonder and help to re-enchant the world!Happy Thoughts,~ Hayley 'Haloquin' Addis",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have always been called to create, to share and connect. Throughout the past 15 years I have been engaged in an exploration of colour and community. I constantly strive to get better and hone my craft as well as work on community causes that contribute to the betterment of our world. This takes resilience and focus, intention and perseverance.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.arteles.org/new_course.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New Course</a> is a one month, guided residency for the personal growth of creative professionals. With collaborative methods and professional guidance by <a href=""https://www.margibrownash.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr. Margi Brown Ash</a>, the program expands and enhances an artist’s creative practice, their routines, and way of being.</p>
<p>I am Finnish and Anishinaabe on my father's side (Irish and English on my mother's side). In 2017, I turned 40 and he turned 70. We decided to celebrate these milestones by journeying together to explore our Finnish ancestry. This decision led to a discovery of the <a href=""https://www.arteles.org/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Arteles Creative Centre</a> in Finland. The look and feel of the place struck a chord, and when the spring residency for New Course was announced, it was natural to apply... And I got in!</p>
<p>For over three years, I have balanced a robust visual art practice, a social art practice, and a creative facilitation practice. My art practices explore the themes of kinship, reconciliation, decolonization, and indigenous traditions through painting and silk screening, intergenerational collaboration, and community weaving. In particular, my creative facilitation has offered a rich opportunity to practice public speaking and listening, storytelling, running workshops, and creating experiential learning spaces for adults and youth.</p>
<p>This residency will be the perfect space to experiment with integrating these practices, while at the same time strengthening my personal commitment and daily routines. With time and space, professional mentorship, and an international creative community with whom to explore, the potential feels world-changing... a whole new era.</p>
<p>And, my father Lloyd, will come to join me, to be witness to my final performance piece, and then to share the wonder of our ancestoral land! We have just over two weeks to explore - family history and new friends, simple pleasures and extravagant novelties. </p>

I have always been called to create, to share and connect. Throughout the past 15 years I have been engaged in an exploration of colour and community. I constantly strive to get better and hone my craft as well as work on community causes that contribute to the betterment of our world. This takes resilience and focus, intention and perseverance.
New Course is a one month, guided residency for the personal growth of creative professionals. With collaborative methods and professional guidance by Dr. Margi Brown Ash, the program expands and enhances an artist’s creative practice, their routines, and way of being.
I am Finnish and Anishinaabe on my father's side (Irish and English on my mother's side). In 2017, I turned 40 and he turned 70. We decided to celebrate these milestones by journeying together to explore our Finnish ancestry. This decision led to a discovery of the Arteles Creative Centre in Finland. The look and feel of the place struck a chord, and when the spring residency for New Course was announced, it was natural to apply... And I got in!
For over three years, I have balanced a robust visual art practice, a social art practice, and a creative facilitation practice. My art practices explore the themes of kinship, reconciliation, decolonization, and indigenous traditions through painting and silk screening, intergenerational collaboration, and community weaving. In particular, my creative facilitation has offered a rich opportunity to practice public speaking and listening, storytelling, running workshops, and creating experiential learning spaces for adults and youth.
This residency will be the perfect space to experiment with integrating these practices, while at the same time strengthening my personal commitment and daily routines. With time and space, professional mentorship, and an international creative community with whom to explore, the potential feels world-changing... a whole new era.
And, my father Lloyd, will come to join me, to be witness to my final performance piece, and then to share the wonder of our ancestoral land! We have just over two weeks to explore - family history and new friends, simple pleasures and extravagant novelties. 
I know that going to Finland will make me a stronger mentor in the community because I will have a more well-rounded view of who I am and where I came from. Integrating all parts of myself will allow me to walk in truth as I continue to mentor and work with youth. I know going to Finland is incredibly important. Of course, I do not know what will come out of it, but I know that this is something I need to do, something I am called to do. I am excited and grateful for this opportunity! 
Anyone for Finnish Pancakes?!

The Impact

These days we often hear that we need a New Story. A story of collaboration, of gratitude, a story of acceptance and wonder, and of a democracy of species where we all matter...
Young and old, all are part of it. Here, there, everywhere, are the places it is needed, and found.
I am one of the many people striving to create, to learn, to share the uplifting stories which might lead to the New Story, creating spaces for participatory, in-the-moment, interactive, international storytelling to happen, so that maybe, just maybe, we might get there. With a little luck.
And a lot of support.
One way or another, I will live this New Story, so that in turn, it can live. This is my dream, my calling.
 

Risks & Challenges
My biggest challenge is putting this crowd-funding campaign together and saying to the world and my community that I need some financial support. Does anyone else have a hard time asking for help??!
When I put my mind to something, I show up and follow through.

<p>Claire Viele is an artist, photographer, writer and model. In the bulk of her work she explores the boundaries and spaces between identities. Through the inclusion of flaw, imperfection and incompleteness in makeup, costumes and settings, and by working primarily with spontaneous posing and affect, Viele seeks to portray herself and her models in light of their organic and ever-changing nature. She induces tension through incompleteness: forming an open question, through which the viewer becomes engaged emotionally and intellectually, and is left to find their own meaning.</p>
<p><span>The most extensive focus in Viele’s portfolio is her self-portrait work, which is part of an ongoing project that began in 2006,  to identify and integrate the multiple parts of her own identity. Through both spontaneous experimentation and meticulous planning, Viele has identified dozens of individual micro-identities within herself and manifested them in her images. Some of her characters are well-defined and integral to her every-day life, while others are representations of a particular point in time, or in-between state unearthed in the process. In this way, her self-portrait project has been as much (or more) about the process, as the ‘finished’ product.</span></p>
<h3>Project and Funding</h3>
<p>A short series of my self-portraits have been accepted the the 2012 Femme Conference in Baltimore, Maryland August 17th and 18th! This conference is entitled ""Pulling the Pieces Together"" and is an exploration in the complexity and expression of femininity and queer lifestyles from a great diversity of regions, classes, races, ethnicities, and abilities. This conference is a great opportunity for artists to share their stories and art; increasing awarness through unique social and cultural viewpoints, and bringing to light important social issues relevant to us all.</p>
<p>The photos I chose to submit are a part of my self-portrait project developed over the last 6 years, and they represent the dramatic transformations of my own explorations into identity. Each image is also it's own feminine character, manifested at various points in my development as a person and artist. The changing skin tones and expressions are external representations of emotion and thought, often driven by my experiences of race, mental illness, ability, and gender, both personally and through those close to me.</p>
<p>I see the diversity of work in this confernce as a valuable opportunity for human beings to share unique experiences and perspectives without judgement or prejudice. Now comes the hard part! Unfortunately, assembling my art and getting it to the conference is an expensive endeavor. In order to make this happen, I need approximately $545 to cover printing, framing and shipping costs. I will be ordering 5 11""x17"" prints from a high-quality printing company, framing them, and shipping them directly to Baltimore for installation.</p>

I have followed the path of art since I was small, drawing for hours every day where ever I was, all the way through college receiving my BFA in ceramic sculpture from CCA(C). Out of this passion, and with the support of family and friends, I built a working artist's studio for the purpose of making, showing and selling my art and facilitating access to the arts in our community. This is my happy place! I share my love for art making with my two kids, 6 and 2, and they provide plenty of inspiration!</span></p><p></p><p></p><p>Along the way I have discovered a love for teaching and collaborating with people in making and showing art. And now you can help me further my art practice AND help me spread my passion for making art to my community! Here in Oakland, as in many places, there is little or no art in the schools. What we do have is a thriving art community! </p><p>By opening my art studio to the community, and offering my guidance and enthusiasm to local children and their families, I am increasing access to the arts for not just our young people, but for the community as a whole. What feeds me is when people find their own way to get their visions out, sometimes we just need some technical input and encouragement, guidance from a creative facilitator.</p><p>I already have some wonderful students and I want to expand my ability to offer my gifts in the forms of individual instruction, classes, workshops for families and individuals, birthday parties for all ages and fun creative community events. I have spoken with neighbors, and many in our community are very excited and enthusiastic about these programs, stopping me on the street to ask: ""When can I sign up?""</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Will you support my vision for my art studio?

I will work with our neighborhood to include community art projects at the fabulous events such as MLK day, Dia de los Muertos and Mayday celebrated at our local park. Community art access is a core value of Big Spirit Studio; building this value into the studio growth makes it a foundational part of Big Spirit Studio.   Hello!  I am Jenna Forder: mama, artist, creative facilitator, and I am so excited to invite you to support a big dream to come true! I have followed the path of art since I was small, drawing for hours every day where ever I was, all the way through college receiving my BFA in ceramic sculpture from CCA(C). Out of this passion, and with the support of family and friends, I built a working artist's studio for the purpose of making, showing and selling my art and facilitating access to the arts in our community. This is my happy place! I share my love for art making with my two kids, 6 and 2, and they provide plenty of inspiration!Along the way I have discovered a love for teaching and collaborating with people in making and showing art. And now you can help me further my art practice AND help me spread my passion for making art to my community! Here in Oakland, as in many places, there is little or no art in the schools. What we do have is a thriving art community! By opening my art studio to the community, and offering my guidance and enthusiasm to local children and their families, I am increasing access to the arts for not just our young people, but for the community as a whole. What feeds me is when people find their own way to get their visions out, sometimes we just need some technical input and encouragement, guidance from a creative facilitator.I already have some wonderful students and I want to expand my ability to offer my gifts in the forms of individual instruction, classes, workshops for families and individuals, birthday parties for all ages and fun creative community events. I have spoken with neighbors, and many in our community are very excited and enthusiastic about these programs, stopping me on the street to ask: ""When can I sign up?""Will you support my vision for my art studio? You will receive my deep appreciation and one of the fabulous thank you gifts listed to the right for your contribution!  The studio is up and running, but in need of a little more financial support to be fully operational. And for your contribution I will send you some beautiful perks that will bring art right into your home! All my perks will be handmade by me with the help of a few of my students. They include hand made cards, prints, ceramic mugs and mixed media artwork. If you are local you can choose to take a workshop at Big Spirit Studio!
Art is Important!              
Art and creating is an innate human tool for discovering and communicating. We've always needed to express ourselves visually. So many don't have access or even have come to believe they are not creative. At Big Spirit Studio I offer a compassionate and fun place to explore and create! To make a mess. We need this in our lives to deepen our understanding, to enrich the experience of life itself. It is time to try a color we didn't know we liked. To spill paint, to get messy. And to make objects that we are proud of. That inspire each other. I get energized just writing this to you!
What needs funding:        
Your contributions will help to get Big Spirit Studio running at a highly functional and professional level, and will help me to keep my pricing affordable and accessible! Here are some of the things you will be funding:Kiln Shed- materials are $384Electrical update for kilns- $500Kiln repair and updating- I already have 2 great kilns that just need a little work- $615Kiln furniture (shelves and posts)- $600A second work table-approx $200 in materialsChairs- $180Easels- $320Advertising, cards etc- $300 More Materials; clay, glazes, paints, brushes, screens for printing etc- $400Childcare for first two months- $1000 (priceless!)How else can you help?Please share this campaign with your community!

<p>Hello it's Yoshi. So, I wanna go to Japan. As you know, I'm on a sick leave from work now (For those of you who didn't know, it's like a worse version of Multiple Sclerosis.). I have lots of time, but no money. Unfortunately my family can't help me out now either. So that made me think of something. What if I beg for money to all my friends? That's right, YOU! So, a dollar or a million, anything would make me happy. The funding goal is only the minimum amount I need to go there. The more I get, the longer I will be able to stay. Please only give me what won't hurt your wallet at all. ANY amount will be greatly appreciated, and I will do my best to repay the favor. I will use the money wisely too. Thank you very much for listening, and please gimme some money! This is probably the last chance I'll have to go to Japan for a good amount of time.

</p>
<p>On a white board
at Lipscomb University in the year 2009, Celeste Debro, was conceptualizing an
idea to help control the conflicts of independent artists. That day her professor pushed her to answer the questions that would
ultimately lead to the development of The Artist Progression Network, Inc. </p>
<p>While interning
in Atlanta in 2011, before obtaining her MA in Conflict Management from
Lipscomb University, Celeste began coaching and facilitating artists to help balance
their career and personal lives. The idea of TAP Network still loomed in her
head as she heard story after story of the same issues between all of the
artists. Some of the reoccurring issues were money, time, not infrequent opportunities and a lack of business knowledge to push them forward. </p>
<p>In August 2011,
TAP Network became an LLC.  Even though
things were still a little cloudy she knew she wanted to set up something to
help multiple artists simultaneously. After consulting some business savvy people, she

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>It’s the creative professionals today who are stimulating
innovation in businesses across the board. Creativity changes the way
information is shared and perceived. This project is extremely needed in these
times due to the overwhelming growth in independent artistry (self-supporting
artist).  As the times have introduced us
to many ways of gathering information and exposing ourselves, via the Internet,
more and more people are pursuing their passions to work as full-time artist.
The problem with that is there are not a lot of legit resources for these
artists to educate themselves on the Do’s and Don’ts when it comes to actually
trying to make a living from their art. Many artists just want to focus on
creativity while leaving the necessary business information in the midst. This
leads to artists not understanding the process it takes for their creations to
become lucrative, which ultimately reduces our economic growth.  This is why we deem it important to campaign
against “The Starving Artist” so that we may shed a different and more economically
stimulating light in the art community.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We may experience
a hard time introducing this concept to individuals who don’t understand the
art world, and that’s ok. The impact that we can have on our communities will
be recognized one way or another through knowledge, perseverance and hard work.
We all have to take risks and without taking those risks we may never know what
we are able to achieve. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 

On a white board
at Lipscomb University in the year 2009, Celeste Debro, was conceptualizing an
idea to help control the conflicts of independent artists. That day her professor pushed her to answer the questions that would
ultimately lead to the development of The Artist Progression Network, Inc. 
While interning
in Atlanta in 2011, before obtaining her MA in Conflict Management from
Lipscomb University, Celeste began coaching and facilitating artists to help balance
their career and personal lives. The idea of TAP Network still loomed in her
head as she heard story after story of the same issues between all of the
artists. Some of the reoccurring issues were money, time, not infrequent opportunities and a lack of business knowledge to push them forward. 
In August 2011,
TAP Network became an LLC.  Even though
things were still a little cloudy she knew she wanted to set up something to
help multiple artists simultaneously. After consulting some business savvy people, she
decided to make TAP a non-profit, giving the artists would have more opportunity to
learn and grow. 
In April 2014, The
Artist Progression Network, Inc. was granted its 501c3.
TAP is raising
money to kick off their Creative Middleman Crash Course that will change the “

  Risks & Challenges 


We may experience
a hard time introducing this concept to individuals who don’t understand the

be recognized one way or another through knowledge, perseverance and hard work.
We all have to take risks and without taking those risks we may never know what

</h3><p>Sosiale bevegelser trenger kulturelle uttrykk for å vinne fram, og venstresiden har lange tradisjoner for å knytte politikk og kultur sammen. De siste årene har denne tradisjonen blitt forsømt og en kan få følelsen av at politikk bare foregår i lukkede møterom. <br/></p><p>Samtidig blåser en venstrevind over Europa og den er båret fram av engasjement nedenfra. I mange europeiske land samles titusener til festivaler arrangert av partier og bevegelser på venstresida. Lørdag 27. august vil vi bringe denne bevegelsen til Oslo. Vi vil fylle Kubaparken med alle som mener verden trenger mindre egoisme og mer rettferdighet. <br/></p><p>Nå trenger vi din hjelp.<br/></p><p><br/></p><div>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Tenk deg en slags blanding mellom Roskilde og politisk konferanse...</h3>
<p>Initiativtaker til Popvenstre er partiet Rødt. Tanken bak er kort sagt at vi ønsker å bidra til en mer utadvendt venstreside. Vi tror mange opplever politiske partier som lukkede. Derfor vil vi lage et sted hvor du ikke trenger å være frelst for å dukke opp. Det holder å være nysgjerrig. Et sted som senker terskelen inn på venstresida.  <br/></p>
<p>Under festivalen vil du kunne oppleve debatter, seminarer, bokbad, øltelt, konserter, 
kulturinnslag, barneprogram, god mat og drikke. Du får dessuten en unik mulighet til å bli
 kjent med likesinnede fra hele landet.</p>

Sosiale bevegelser trenger kulturelle uttrykk for å vinne fram, og venstresiden har lange tradisjoner for å knytte politikk og kultur sammen. De siste årene har denne tradisjonen blitt forsømt og en kan få følelsen av at politikk bare foregår i lukkede møterom. Samtidig blåser en venstrevind over Europa og den er båret fram av engasjement nedenfra. I mange europeiske land samles titusener til festivaler arrangert av partier og bevegelser på venstresida. Lørdag 27. august vil vi bringe denne bevegelsen til Oslo. Vi vil fylle Kubaparken med alle som mener verden trenger mindre egoisme og mer rettferdighet. Nå trenger vi din hjelp.

Tenk deg en slags blanding mellom Roskilde og politisk konferanse...
Initiativtaker til Popvenstre er partiet Rødt. Tanken bak er kort sagt at vi ønsker å bidra til en mer utadvendt venstreside. Vi tror mange opplever politiske partier som lukkede. Derfor vil vi lage et sted hvor du ikke trenger å være frelst for å dukke opp. Det holder å være nysgjerrig. Et sted som senker terskelen inn på venstresida.  
Under festivalen vil du kunne oppleve debatter, seminarer, bokbad, øltelt, konserter, 
kulturinnslag, barneprogram, god mat og drikke. Du får dessuten en unik mulighet til å bli
 kjent med likesinnede fra hele landet.
Les mer om programmet på http://popvenstre.no

Mye er allerede klartPopvenstre-programmet kan allerede nå skilte med noen av de største stjernene på den radikale venstresida: Bhaskar Sunkara (redaktør i amerikanske Jacobin Magazine), Catarina Principe (Bloco de Esquerda i Portugal), Pablo Bustinduy (Podemos i Spania) og Kajsa Ekis Ekman (journalist og forfatter). På musikkfronten kan vi friste med konserter med Albert og Elise som spiller Hoola Bandoola på norsk, magiske Einar Stray Orchestra, den vakre og lavmælte duoen Ole & Silje Huleboer og mer til. Ikke minst gleder vi oss til å høre artist Moddi fortelle om sin siste plate med forbudte sanger fra hele verden.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I was awarded a scholarship to take a class at Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. However, I need your help to get there! With the cost of gas, registration and material expenses I need approximately $600. Any gift, big or small, will help more than you know. Thank you for your support.</p>
<p>If you don't know me already, I am BOIBOY, I am an interdisciplinary artist currently based Kansas City, Missouri. Working primarily as an installation, performance and video artist. While at the Kansas City Art Institute I have participated in The West 18th Street Fashion Show, a solo show at Undergrads Underground in the Leedy Voulkos Art Center, and a Performance Art Symposium hosted by The Charlotte Street Foundation. As well I have interned with MYARTS (Metropolitan Youth Arts and Technology for Students), Peggy Noland and Plug Projects.</p>
<p>My work explores ideas related to home, religion, and dissociative moments of transcendence expressed through a dogma of symbolism and color. The work is influenced by New Wave Queer Cinema and Club Kid culture with references to Catholic iconography and cinematic narrative structures.</p>
<p>After recently graduating from The Kansas City Art Institute I want to make sure I continue to grow as an artist. This means reaching out and exploring new communities of national artist such as the diverse community of artist Arrowmount will provide.</p>
<p>This workshop will expose me to a new material and process as well , Fosshape (see description of class below)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>The Class</h3>
<p>Transforming the 2D Surface to 3D with Fosshape taught by Leisa Rich</p>
<p>Students will transform a revolutionary 2D material called Fosshape -- a unique, low melt synthetic polyester fiber that when exposed to heat and pressure easily hardens -- into rigid, 3D forms. They will learn simple methods of construction including hand/machine stitching to create and build shape, methods of fusing pieces together for temporary hold, distressing to create texture, cutting away and stretching to transform mass, and molding to create form over objects. Before being heated (still soft and 2D) and after being heated (hardened and 3D) students will apply simple, non-toxic dye/paint techniques using DyeNaFlow non-toxic, permanent dyes to add saturated color and contrast. Acrylic spray paint and brushed on acrylic applications will add definition. Hand embroidery and mixed media will further transform your personal creative vision- use it to enhance existing projects, embellish surfaces, add depth through built-up texture and more applications. Turn your pieces into sculptures, vessels, representational forms or wearable art. Unlimited sculptural applications such as maquettes and bases for other art/craft disciplines, an armature for structural felting, theatrical applications such as set pieces and costumes, and more suit a variety of art needs that can be utilized after the workshop in your own art practice.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign is particularly important because it supports Joe's first international summer residency with PremArts in Berlin, Germany. Funds are going straight to resources like canvas and paint supplies, so your help is making a direct impact. We could break it out by how many paintbrushes, tubes of paint, or canvas's will be bought but what we think is most important to know, is that every single dollar raised is going to the creation of artwork. It's not going to rent or transportation or food costs. This is like farm to table but for visual art! Your support is making a direct impact on the creative development in this project. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We live in a time of enormous and rapid change, a time that needs the wild thinking and making of artists. We live in a time inundated by images: pictures, language, videos, stories, bodies. Majority of these images are made for one reason: to get you to buy something. Artists are responsible for that tiny sliver of images that can be made for every other possible reason: cultural, spiritual, political, emotional. Art and entertainment do different things - entertainment distracts our attention and art focuses it and highlights/questions it.</p>
<p>HYPE address youth and media culture. The overwhelming need to be popular on social media, to “be cool” and to buy the trendiest clothing has a serious impact on youth and taken commercialism to a new height. Hypebeasts are people who obsess about the latest brand or trend in fashion, and will do whatever it takes to obtain that desired hype. However, not everyone that wears these brands are hypebeasts. HYPE addresses the impact of this trend on youth culture, while hyperbolizing the fine line between being a slave to the brand and the brand abusing hype-culture.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Being an artist is not an easy profession in our current socio-political climate -- not finding funding support or reaching the needed goal is always a risk. The good news though, is that artists are creatives, so we inherently know how to make the most out of any opportunity. Joe is going to Berlin with whatever funds are raised from this campaign. If the financial goal here isn't met, Joe will find ways to be creative with whatever funding is available.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Awareness is just as important as raising money, so if you're unable to make a monetary contribution towards our project but would still like to help, please share our crowdfunding page and help us reach our goal!</p>

The Impact
We live in a time of enormous and rapid change, a time that needs the wild thinking and making of artists. We live in a time inundated by images: pictures, language, videos, stories, bodies. Majority of these images are made for one reason: to get you to buy something. Artists are responsible for that tiny sliver of images that can be made for every other possible reason: cultural, spiritual, political, emotional. Art and entertainment do different things - entertainment distracts our attention and art focuses it and highlights/questions it.
HYPE address youth and media culture. The overwhelming need to be popular on social media, to “be cool” and to buy the trendiest clothing has a serious impact on youth and taken commercialism to a new height. Hypebeasts are people who obsess about the latest brand or trend in fashion, and will do whatever it takes to obtain that desired hype. However, not everyone that wears these brands are hypebeasts. HYPE addresses the impact of this trend on youth culture, while hyperbolizing the fine line between being a slave to the brand and the brand abusing hype-culture.

Risks & Challenges
Being an artist is not an easy profession in our current socio-political climate -- not finding funding support or reaching the needed goal is always a risk. The good news though, is that artists are creatives, so we inherently know how to make the most out of any opportunity. Joe is going to Berlin with whatever funds are raised from this campaign. If the financial goal here isn't met, Joe will find ways to be creative with whatever funding is available.

<h3>Fifth Times a Charm</h3>
<p>Things are different this year. For the first time in a very long time I feel completely committed to my studio practice. While I don't have the predictable support of a day job, it's freed me up to make my work my primary focus again. The last few years have had many ups and downs, but I finally feel like I'm headed in the right direction. I have made an entirely new body of work that will be debuting at <a href=""http://www.sieraadartfair.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SIERAAD</a>, with only a select number of pieces available here in this fundraiser.</p>
<p>I'm also head-over-heels for Ben Smasher, and he's coming with me to help assist with sales, be my cheerleader, and bring me sandwiches when I forget to eat so I don't get cranky at customers.</p>

<h3>Travel for Two Ain't Cheap!</h3>
<p>We will be gone for nearly a week and a half, with two days devoted to preparation and set up for the fair, four days of sales, and just a little bit of recovery time before heading home.  We've made this trip as cheap as we possibly can thanks to a lot of generosity and support from my SIERAAD family. We are lucky enough to stay with the delightful<a href=""http://www.lezerman.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Linda Ezerman</a>, an amazing jewelry maker based outside of Amsterdam, who is also splitting a booth with me. Still, airfare for two, food for 11 days, as well as the cost of the fair itself add up. We've only been able to plan this by tying up what little capital I had, as well as multiple credit card balances. This is how artists and small business owners grow in a culture that has little support for either. </p>
<p>Yes, I hope to make money back at the fair, but there is never any guarantee. And being away from home, trying to focus on sales while wondering if there's enough in the bank account to cover bills is a nightmare. We don't want handouts!  What we've done is use this as an opportunity to collaborate in the studio, working together to try some experimental documentation as I create the new work for this year's fair. The resulting photos have been used to generate what I hope is charmingly quaint merchandising for more affordable donations. The one of a kind pieces available in this fundraiser have never been exhibited before, and were especially selected from work heading to the fair. If you cannot make it to Amsterdam for SIERAAD, or you don't want to wait to try and choose your favorite there, then this is your chance to get these pieces before anyone else! </p>
<h3>Why Do I Keep Going Back?</h3>
<p>I've been lucky enough to attend SIERAAD since 2012, making this my fifth year exhibiting at the fair. The first time I was invited, I waved it off thinking it was too daunting. I only finally agreed when I was beginning to feel that I needed some guiding event on my calendar to keep me motivated.  I had no idea that over the next five years SIERAAD would become the guiding event during the most difficult period in my life. Many personal losses left me all but inactive in the studio for long stretches, with only the looming excitement of my friends in Amsterdam and the crowd at SIERAAD rousing me for a period of the year before the fair. The automatic work of it helped keep me from feeling completely adrift, and the organizers, colleagues, and collectors were profoundly patient with me.</p>
<p>In 2012, I was the first American to travel from the US to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRsweb2KbUA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">participate</a>.</p>
<p>In 2013, I brought <a href=""http://crafthaus.ning.com/group/us-art-jewelers-at-sieraad-fall-2013/forum/topic/show?id=2104389%3ATopic%3A448547&amp;xg_source=msg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">9 friends</a> from the US to exhibit with me and helped support many others by documenting my experiences. I have continued to help get the word out to more makers, both in the US and abroad, ever since. I cannot speak highly enough of this event. It has been the cornerstone of my practice, introducing my work to new galleries and new collectors every year. The cost of participation is well worth it, with the fee going toward the building of a custom display space that helps emerging artists present at their best. Sales are handled by the fair, the publicity is unbelievable, and rigorous security ensures a level of professionalism and comfort that no other event offers. Though it is not cheap, it is an unbelievable deal. How could I not go back one more time to celebrate my fifth year just as SIERAAD celebrates its fifteenth?</p>

<div>Il fallait maintenant trouver un thème à cette exposition, et c'est vers le genre d'univers ''préféré'' vers lequel je me tournais: le dark-fantasy: démons, sorcières, fées, etc...

The Lord of the Rings has played a big role in all this when I really think about it! :DThis project means a lot to me since it is the first time I show a set of my own work (and surely not the last)! I also expects forward critics, whether good or bad.The amount of funding will be used to help expenses such as frames, invitations printed cards, canvas, prints, opening (vernissage) and the great gifts given by counterparties ! These will be illustrations, reproductions of the exposed paintings, some will even be customized if you are crazy enough !!

<p>If you would
love to just get a nice picture from China this project is also great for you.
I will draw nice things, flowers and landscapes. The pictures will be sized as
a postcard. You can choose the small postcard (ca. A6 11 × 15cm; 4.3 x 5.9in)
or double size (ca. A5 15 × 21cm; 5.9 x 8.3in). For the safety of the picture

they will be send as a letter.</p>
<p>For $7 I
will send you a foto of a picture I will draw in China on your email. Do not forget
to write your email address if
you want to get it.</p>
<p>In case you
are a patron of art there is also something for you. I will paint a very big
postcard (ca. A4 21 × 31cm; 8.3 x 12.6in). This opportunity is ready only for
one patron. The person who will first make a contribution of $ 499 will receive
this image. For its safety this picture will be send from Europe.</p>

Everything is powered by a 25 kW generator, which provides 3-phase 240 V power. We use a step-up transformer (“Lucifer’) and 3-phase diode bridge to charge the 20mF link capacitor bank (the ‘Spark of the Covenant’) to 800 VDC, which acts as the power source for the inverter.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530000429/j2clmdnpt0qvvgfvggp7.png"" src=""""/></p><p>The resonant circuit consists of the primary capacitor bank (the ‘Flux Capacitor’), the air-core transformer (the ‘Trans-raver’), the two resonator coils, and the 8-ft diameter toroids.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530760700/dxniyhmli0rmzt1gkohs.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Each resonator is approximately quarter-wave resonant at 64 kHz, so the series combination of the two resonators and toroids is half-wave resonant at the same frequency, and presents a nearly-real impedance to the transformer at this frequency.

The benefit of this arrangement is that the majority of the voltage increase occurs within the resonator coils (rather than in the transformer), reducing voltage stress and corona around the transformer and allowing tighter coupling. The resonators and transformer secondary use a 3-layer winding structure that reduces proximity effect resistive losses by increasing the spacing between conductors without increasing the overall coil length, resulting in a higher resonator quality factor (Q).

How your support makes an impactTo make the Tesla Coils upgrade a reality, test and troubleshoot the new system, transport and fire our Tesla coils to Burning Man, we need your help to raise funds of approximately $15,000.Your donations will help us secure:
Materials for the high-current circuit
Circuit assembly 
Generator rental for testing purposes
Custom Capacitor Bank elements 
Transportation from Oakland to Black Rock City and back
What we have to offer at Burning Man 2018This year, Sextant will be back and brighter, better, and louder than ever. By contributing, you’ll help us bring the best:

<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">Oh, one more question.</span></div>

<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">BIKINI LINES is a proposed massive, mixed media installation inspired by the lack of standardized nuclear disaster reporting, in particular the panic that set in over Tokyo following the March 2011 Earthquake, Tsunami and subsequent meltdown. (<a href=""http://www.bikinilines.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""bikini lines"">Check out our sexy webpage</a>!)</span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;""><br/></span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">Our main focus is on creating the World’s Largest Painting on an historically significant &amp; sublimely remote Pacific Island (<a href=""http://www.bikinilines.net/cactus-dome-location.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">no, seriously</a>!), using the Cactus Dome as a canvas (!!). The <a href=""http://atlasobscura.com/place/cactus-dome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Cactus Dome</a> was built between 1977-80 to house the radioactive debris from Bikini &amp; surrounding atolls (!!!). We're using this awesome setup as an excuse to film a great documentary: we feel that 20+ strangers living on a desert island in the middle of the Pacific working together to create a piece of art viewable in Google Earth has an inherent excitement to it. And you know what? When this movie is finished, we plan on selling it, but instead of collecting any $, 100% of the profits will be donated to the Ashinaga Foundation, an NGO that helps children orphaned in Natural Disasters. We basically want to help Fukushima children that were orphaned in the March 2011 Japanese disasters, you dig?</span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;""><br/></span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">Before you read on, though, please understand that none of this happens without your generosity. Also, if you're an artist, you're gonna really like what's coming up!</span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;""><br/></span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">Largely forgotten, the Cactus Dome has long been declared safe but was off limits until now: with special permission from the Marshallese government we invite you to participate in this crowd sourced adventure as financier and potential participant &amp; documentarian, because really, you’re as much a part of it as we are. </span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;""><br/></span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">To clarify:  we’re giving you a chance to have <a href=""http://www.bikinilines.net/artists--designers.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">your design</a> painted on the dome; to <a href=""http://www.bikinilines.net/directors--videographers.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">direct our documentary</a>; to be our official on-site <a href=""http://www.bikinilines.net/photographers.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">photographer</a> &amp; <a href=""http://www.bikinilines.net/writers--bloggers.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">writer</a>. (!!!!). No, really. We're taking online submissions from artists, videographers, photographers and writers. The crowd decides the winners in each category! And you know what, it's free to enter. I mean, we do hope that you're interested in donating some money to the campaign (your choice), but again: this all hangs on your generosity. We need donations to make the painting to justify the video to help the children, so yes, as Mike Tyson said after taking out Robocop with a swift uppercut: ""won't you please think of the children!""</span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;""><br/></span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">We even have wildcard spots for people who want a chance to join but don't have an artistic bone in their body! That's right, anybody can tweet #bikinilines at any time to tell us, in 140 characters or less, why you should join. We'll scour the tweets daily and handpick the awesomest answers. </span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;""><br/></span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">Consider this a new type of crowd-funded reality media built on art, adventure, collaboration and documentation, but with much higher stakes. The people of Fukushima will only be helped through great collaboration, and this is our way of giving back, so join us as we converge on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enewetak_Atoll"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Enewetak Atoll</a> in the Marshall Islands where we will collectively spend December 2012 living on the secluded desert island of Runit ritualistically cleaning and painting the Cactus Dome, turning it into a monument. Conscientious &amp; participatory art, adventure and reality media.  Only you can make this happen.</span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;""><br/></span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">Impact</span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">We really want this project to be a benefit to everybody involved. The artists (designer, videographer, photographer and writer) who earn a chance to join us by winning the design, videography, photography or writing aspects of the contest will hopefully achieve instant recognition for their work and benefit from greater career options afterwards. The Marshall Islands will gain more recognition from international media &amp; hopefully see a boost in tourism. Most importantly, though, Fukushima orphans will benefit from media sales. Again, 100% of the sales of our documentary will be donated to the <a href=""http://www.ashinaga.org/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">Ashinaga Foundation</a>, which helps orphaned children achieve an education. </span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;""><br/></span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">What we need &amp; what you get</span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">$200,000 allows us to run operations without cutting too many unforeseen corners. Paint alone will cost between 25K and 50K depending on the quality used. Boat and airplane charters will run another 25K. Getting artists (designers, videographers, photographers and writers) &amp; the standard production team (3-4 people on site) to Enewetak from their hometowns will cost 4-5K each. Food, fresh water, <a href=""http://www.bikinilines.net/expedition-supplies.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">survival gear</a> and island infrastructure will run upwards of 20K. These major points will use up 75% of our budget; it would be nice to have extra cash on hand in order to ensure a higher level of quality and safety. Post-production marketing will be solely reliant on the amount of reserve cash we have. We will also be asking for corporate funding to help ensure safety &amp; success, though their presence will be minimal. This won't be like Burning Man, well, not with regards to branding!</span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;""><br/></span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">Note: we will be running 2 consecutive campaigns. The fundraising goal for each campaign is $100,000 USD. This is because we can begin gathering supplies and planning logistics over the course of a longer campaign, and it gives artist's time to prepare, submit and market their proposals. We know that many campaigns benefit from shorter, immediate pushes, but feel that ours has to be quite long to really give artists a chance to properly prepare and market their work. </span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;""><br/></span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">Campaign One: February 1st until April 30th 2012</span></div>

<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;""><br/></span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">But what happens if we don't reach our funding goals?</span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;""><br/></span></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: #999999;"">We can't proceed if we don't reach a minimum target of $75,000. In this case we will personally return monies to all people who donated more than $100 to our campaign. As we are still committed to helping children orphaned in the Fukushima disaster, any leftover monies will be donated to the Ashinaga foundation. The production team will keep nothing aside from dashed dreams!</span></div>

The writer will be asked to join if it's within budget; the wild card will not be able to join. The artist will not join but will still receive credit for their design. A modified, paint-economical version of the official design will be painted on the dome.

(fly-on-the-wall dialogue overheard when first discussing the project) 


Q. What is Bikini Lines?A. Bikini Lines is a proposal to create the world's largest street painting using the Cactus Dome as a Canvas.Q. What is the Cactus Dome?A. The Cactus Dome is a 107m (350ft) wide dome in the Marshall Islands (South Pacific) that looks like the disk section of the USS Enterprise. Q. Is this dome famous?A. Yes, in a way. Actually, it's infamous. It was built between 1977-80 to contain the radioactive debris from Bikini & surrounding atolls. Q. Ahh, so that's why it's called Bikini Lines. Why are you painting it?A. So that we can film an awesome feature length documentary that includes elements of travelogue, adventure and art. The project is huge and the location incredibly interesting yet under represented in popular media.Q. Anything else you can tell us about the documentary?A. Indeed! We will release this documentary to broadcasters  & the general public with 100% (one hundred percent!) of the profits, now & forever, being donated to the Ashinaga Foundation for the benefit of children orphaned in the Japanese 3.11 disasters. Q. Wow, sounds cool! Can I get involved?A. If course! In fact, there are 7 ways you can get involved. Pick one, or pick all!1. Consider skipping Starbucks & donating a minimum of $5 to our IndieGoGo campaign to make this happen. Bikini Lines relies on public donations, and for each level of donation you give, we'll give you an awesome reward.2. Upload a design that you would like to see painted on the Dome! Yep, that's right, we're taking submissions from artists & designers as to what we should actually paint on the dome. Think of it; your art painting for all the world to see in Google Earth. That would look pretty sweet on a resume!3. Upload some videos for a chance to become our official documentary director. (seriously!)4. Upload some photographs for a chance to become our official on-site photographer!5. Upload a written proposal for a chance to become our official blogger!6. Or, try your hand at our wildcard spot if you're an adventurer without artistic ability :)7. Lastly, *crush it* on social media. Blog about us, Tweet us, spread the word by Facebook or G+ or even Linkedin. Become Bikini Lines ambassadors in your local niche or scholastic ecosystem. Get your friends & family involved artistically and financially. $5 man, that's it!

Oh, one more question.
~shoot
Can you give me a detailed rundown of everything ever?

Yep, here we go~!

BIKINI LINES is a proposed massive, mixed media installation inspired by the lack of standardized nuclear disaster reporting, in particular the panic that set in over Tokyo following the March 2011 Earthquake, Tsunami and subsequent meltdown. (Check out our sexy webpage!)

Our main focus is on creating the World’s Largest Painting on an historically significant & sublimely remote Pacific Island (no, seriously!), using the Cactus Dome as a canvas (!!). The Cactus Dome was built between 1977-80 to house the radioactive debris from Bikini & surrounding atolls (!!!). We're using this awesome setup as an excuse to film a great documentary: we feel that 20+ strangers living on a desert island in the middle of the Pacific working together to create a piece of art viewable in Google Earth has an inherent excitement to it. And you know what? When this movie is finished, we plan on selling it, but instead of collecting any $, 100% of the profits will be donated to the Ashinaga Foundation, an NGO that helps children orphaned in Natural Disasters. We basically want to help Fukushima children that were orphaned in the March 2011 Japanese disasters, you dig?

Before you read on, though, please understand that none of this happens without your generosity. Also, if you're an artist, you're gonna really like what's coming up!

Largely forgotten, the Cactus Dome has long been declared safe but was off limits until now: with special permission from the Marshallese government we invite you to participate in this crowd sourced adventure as financier and potential participant & documentarian, because really, you’re as much a part of it as we are. 

To clarify:  we’re giving you a chance to have your design painted on the dome; to direct our documentary; to be our official on-site photographer & writer. (!!!!). No, really. We're taking online submissions from artists, videographers, photographers and writers. The crowd decides the winners in each category! And you know what, it's free to enter. I mean, we do hope that you're interested in donating some money to the campaign (your choice), but again: this all hangs on your generosity. We need donations to make the painting to justify the video to help the children, so yes, as Mike Tyson said after taking out Robocop with a swift uppercut: ""won't you please think of the children!""

We even have wildcard spots for people who want a chance to join but don't have an artistic bone in their body! That's right, anybody can tweet #bikinilines at any time to tell us, in 140 characters or less, why you should join. We'll scour the tweets daily and handpick the awesomest answers. 

Consider this a new type of crowd-funded reality media built on art, adventure, collaboration and documentation, but with much higher stakes. The people of Fukushima will only be helped through great collaboration, and this is our way of giving back, so join us as we converge on the Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands where we will collectively spend December 2012 living on the secluded desert island of Runit ritualistically cleaning and painting the Cactus Dome, turning it into a monument. Conscientious & participatory art, adventure and reality media.  Only you can make this happen.

Impact
We really want this project to be a benefit to everybody involved. The artists (designer, videographer, photographer and writer) who earn a chance to join us by winning the design, videography, photography or writing aspects of the contest will hopefully achieve instant recognition for their work and benefit from greater career options afterwards. The Marshall Islands will gain more recognition from international media & hopefully see a boost in tourism. Most importantly, though, Fukushima orphans will benefit from media sales. Again, 100% of the sales of our documentary will be donated to the Ashinaga Foundation, which helps orphaned children achieve an education. 

What we need & what you get
$200,000 allows us to run operations without cutting too many unforeseen corners. Paint alone will cost between 25K and 50K depending on the quality used. Boat and airplane charters will run another 25K. Getting artists (designers, videographers, photographers and writers) & the standard production team (3-4 people on site) to Enewetak from their hometowns will cost 4-5K each. Food, fresh water, survival gear and island infrastructure will run upwards of 20K. These major points will use up 75% of our budget; it would be nice to have extra cash on hand in order to ensure a higher level of quality and safety. Post-production marketing will be solely reliant on the amount of reserve cash we have. We will also be asking for corporate funding to help ensure safety & success, though their presence will be minimal. This won't be like Burning Man, well, not with regards to branding!

Note: we will be running 2 consecutive campaigns. The fundraising goal for each campaign is $100,000 USD. This is because we can begin gathering supplies and planning logistics over the course of a longer campaign, and it gives artist's time to prepare, submit and market their proposals. We know that many campaigns benefit from shorter, immediate pushes, but feel that ours has to be quite long to really give artists a chance to properly prepare and market their work. 

Campaign One: February 1st until April 30th 2012
Campaign Two: May 1st until July 31st 2012

But what happens if we don't reach our funding goals?

We can't proceed if we don't reach a minimum target of $75,000. In this case we will personally return monies to all people who donated more than $100 to our campaign. As we are still committed to helping children orphaned in the Fukushima disaster, any leftover monies will be donated to the Ashinaga foundation. The production team will keep nothing aside from dashed dreams!

$75,000 - $125,000; The Skeleton Crew
The following people will be brought to the Dome: two producers, director, photographer and extra local Marshallese members. The writer will be asked to join if it's within budget; the wild card will not be able to join. The artist will not join but will still receive credit for their design. A modified, paint-economical version of the official design will be painted on the dome. The film will still be produced and all other rewards honored, including those who paid a deposit to join us on-site. Accommodations and entertainment will be minimal. 

$125,000 - $200,000; The Zombie Crew
The following people will be brought to the Dome: two producers, director, photographer, writer, wild card and extra local Marshallese members. The artist will be asked to join if it's within budget; as per above, their proposal might have to be made more economical from a paint perspective. Again, accommodations and entertainment will be minimal.

$200,000; The Standard Crew
The adventure will commence as planned!

And what if we surpass our goals?

$250,000+
An extra photographer and wild card will be brought (as selected from the short listed nominees). More money will be spent on developing the local infrastructure. Accommodations will be more comfortable & entertainment more entertaining. 

$350,000+ (The Party Crew)
An extra photographer, writer and 2+ wild cards will be brought (as selected from the short listed nominees). We'll also send out an invite to bands who may want to perform live. Accommodations will be as good as they get; rice will turn into BBQ, water into beer. More money will also be allocated to the film's post-production (editing, marketing, etc). We will populate the Dome with more & more Wild Card members depending on how much we raise.

How you can help
We've tried to incentivize this project for artists (""artists"" = designers, videographers, photographers and writers) by giving you a free opportunity to submit & market your respective proposals for a chance to join us on site; again, we feel that this is a great project to help out young artists! We would love it if 10,000+ artists submitted proposals and asked their family and friends to vote for them! Of course, we would love it if you & your family also donated some money to the campaign since this project won't happen without your work, but also your generosity. All you have to do is upload your proposals to Flickr (photography & design proposals), Userfarm (video proposals) or Scribd (writing proposals), and then market your work! We will shortlist 10-20 proposals in each artistic category based on the amount of ""favorites"" & positive commentary you receive from your friends and fans. Instructions on how to upload and market each type of proposal are easily found at www.bikinilines.net. 

This is also a great opportunity to consider the other rewards and prizes we're offering through IndieGoGo. We've tried to make them personal, so that you really feel as if you're part of this epic adventure! Some are pretty cool, like the chance to become an associate producer or own a relic from on-site; others are more down to earth, like pre-purchasing the finished documentary or a handsome giclée print of the final design. 

But you know what? Even if you don't have an artistic bone in your body there is still a chance to win a ""wild card"" spot to join us on site! This is actually pretty cool: you see, because we want to make this adventure open to everybody, we're giving you a chance to Tweet ""@bikinilines"" why you should join us. Again, check out our homepage for full deets. 

Lastly,
...if you get an A-list celebrity to tweet us, we'll give you a ""digital media consultant"" credit in the finished film :)

We've got a pretty extensive FAQ, so head on over if you have any questions. 

Bikini Lines really is about art & adventure for a really good cause, so help us spread the word today!

<span class=""notranlsate""><h2>Rupert was his name.</h2>
<p>Rupert the rabbit.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/126573/files/20131010214355-Rupert_2.JPG?1381466635"" src="""" style=""width: 490.66px; height: 368px;""/></p>
<p>He came to nibble at my thoughts and heart, tickling and tickling until I finally turned my full attention to him, to learn what he had to say.  And WOW!  - was I ever surprised!</p>
<p>It was never my intention to write a children's book, but it was certainly <em><strong>his</strong></em> intention to have me teach children about the Wheel of the Year.  And so I have.  We started with Beltane, my furry friend and I, then we worked our way throughout the seasons and Sabbats.  And when I was done, I shared his stories everywhere.  </p>
<p>To my great surprise, many wanted to know where they could buy these stories for themselves.  It was with even greater surprise - if that was possible -  that within <strong><em>one hour </em></strong>of submitting his stories to Schiffer Publishing, the president of the company himself wrote and asked me for more!</p>
<p>That, however, was not the end of the surprises.  Oh no - not at all!  Very soon after that, an artist by the name of Tonia hopped into our lives and presented me with the picture you see above, showing me exactly what our delightful friend looked like.</p>
<p>And so were the first three Rupert's Tales titles created.  The first book tells stories of Beltane, Litha, Lammas, and Mabon.  The second has tales about Samhain, Yule, Imbolc, and Ostara.       </p>
<p>      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/128617/files/20131011224018-9780764336898.jpg?1381556418"" src="""" style=""width: 207.56px; height: 186px;""/>       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/126620/files/20131010221528-9780764339875.jpg?1381468528"" src="""" style=""width: 211.58px; height: 187px;""/></p>
<p>And our third title is an Activity Book with pictures to color from both of these books.</p>
<p>                                  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/126623/files/20131010221821-9780764340208.jpg?1381468701"" src="""" style=""width: 184.2px; height: 239px;""/></p>
<p>But this is not where our story ends.  Oh no!  Not at all!  Rupert has much, much more to teach us all, I can tell you that!</p>
<p>We have just released <strong><em>""Rupert's Tales: Rupert Helps Clean Up""</em></strong> which has four stories in which Rupert learns about reducing, reusing and recycling:</p>
<p>                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/126656/files/20131010223819-9780764342844.jpg?1381469899"" src="""" style=""width: 218.86px; height: 196px;""/></p>
<p>If that isn't enough, you should know we will have a brand new book in 2014 with four bedtime stories in it.  And that, my friends, is why the time has come to be able to have your very own Huggable Rupert - so you can hold and hug him while you read about Daragon the dragon, Brody the bat, Rachael the raccoon, Marissa the mermaid, Ulna the Unicorn and many more of Rupert's new friends - and their adventures in learning how important it is that you get a good night's sleep, and how you can control your own dreams so they are sweeter than ever before.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Cost of making Huggable Rupert:</h2>
<p>First, you should know there are federal safety regulations regarding the manufacture of children's toys which made some of the options I had considered impossible, and the rest of my options very expensive.</p>
<p>Not all rabbits look like Rupert, as you can see:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/126510/files/20131010205932-Brown_Fur_-_01.jpg?1381463972"" src="""" style=""width: 155.48px; height: 161px;""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/126512/files/20131010210026-Grey_Rabbit.jpg?1381464026"" src="""" style=""width: 173px; height: 173px;""/>       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/126527/files/20131010211816-Hairy.jpg?1381465096"" src="""" style=""width: 141px; height: 141px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the MOST-important parts of the entire process is to make sure the ""<strong>Huggable Rupert"" </strong>looks like <em>our</em> Rupert. A sample must be created first - one to my specifications.</p>
<p>And there are minimum order requirements which must be met.  One of the potential manufacturers requires a minimum of 900 pieces, the other requires 500, but has a substantially higher per-piece price.</p>
<p>Our goal of $9,000 is the bare minimum we will need in order to get the project completed and includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sew-on tags</li>
<li>Shipping Allowance</li>
<li>Agent Fees (Customs)</li>
<li>Production Fees</li>
<li>Safety Regulation Compliance</li>
<li>Sample Creation Development (with unlimited revisions)</li>
<li>Taxes for Funds Received</li>
<li>PayPal, Credit Card, and IndieGogo Fees</li>
<li>Shipment of Perks - Including Huggable Ruperts</li>
</ul>
<p>Average completion of the design and manufacture process is 12 weeks - once the order has been placed and payment has been made.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>You Asked for Rupert</h3>
<p>And Oh - how we want to bring him to you!</p>
<p>By contributing $25 or more, you are actually purchasing your own Huggable Rupert in advance.  It's really that simple.</p>
<p>This is my own Huggable Rupert - a very well-loved model from which we are creating a new plush toy for generations of children (and grandchildren!) to come! </p>

<p>Although this one is smaller than ours will be, this picture should give you a good idea of what we intend to create so (you and) your child can have a furry friend of their own with which to enjoy reading Rupert's Tales.  There <strong><em>many</em></strong> more adventures to come as we look forward to ""Rupert Learns about Making Magick,"" ""The Nature of Elements,"" ""Celebrate Being You,"" and more!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We relalize some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help.  Please share our campaign with your friends, and family members, and even with those organizations and groups who have folks in them who you know would be interested in having their own Huggable Rupert!</p>
<p>And while you're waiting for yours to hug and hold while you drift off to sleep, maybe this song will help you on your way to sweeter dreams:</p>

Rupert the rabbit.

He came to nibble at my thoughts and heart, tickling and tickling until I finally turned my full attention to him, to learn what he had to say.  And WOW!  - was I ever surprised!
It was never my intention to write a children's book, but it was certainly his intention to have me teach children about the Wheel of the Year.  And so I have.  We started with Beltane, my furry friend and I, then we worked our way throughout the seasons and Sabbats.  And when I was done, I shared his stories everywhere.  
To my great surprise, many wanted to know where they could buy these stories for themselves.  It was with even greater surprise - if that was possible -  that within one hour of submitting his stories to Schiffer Publishing, the president of the company himself wrote and asked me for more!
That, however, was not the end of the surprises.  Oh no - not at all!  Very soon after that, an artist by the name of Tonia hopped into our lives and presented me with the picture you see above, showing me exactly what our delightful friend looked like.
And so were the first three Rupert's Tales titles created.  The first book tells stories of Beltane, Litha, Lammas, and Mabon.  The second has tales about Samhain, Yule, Imbolc, and Ostara.       
             
And our third title is an Activity Book with pictures to color from both of these books.
                                  
But this is not where our story ends.  Oh no!  Not at all!  Rupert has much, much more to teach us all, I can tell you that!
We have just released ""Rupert's Tales: Rupert Helps Clean Up"" which has four stories in which Rupert learns about reducing, reusing and recycling:
                          
If that isn't enough, you should know we will have a brand new book in 2014 with four bedtime stories in it.  And that, my friends, is why the time has come to be able to have your very own Huggable Rupert - so you can hold and hug him while you read about Daragon the dragon, Brody the bat, Rachael the raccoon, Marissa the mermaid, Ulna the Unicorn and many more of Rupert's new friends - and their adventures in learning how important it is that you get a good night's sleep, and how you can control your own dreams so they are sweeter than ever before.
 
Cost of making Huggable Rupert:
First, you should know there are federal safety regulations regarding the manufacture of children's toys which made some of the options I had considered impossible, and the rest of my options very expensive.
Not all rabbits look like Rupert, as you can see:
          
 
One of the MOST-important parts of the entire process is to make sure the ""Huggable Rupert"" looks like our Rupert. A sample must be created first - one to my specifications.
And there are minimum order requirements which must be met.  One of the potential manufacturers requires a minimum of 900 pieces, the other requires 500, but has a substantially higher per-piece price.
Our goal of $9,000 is the bare minimum we will need in order to get the project completed and includes:

Sew-on tags
Shipping Allowance
Agent Fees (Customs)
Production Fees
Safety Regulation Compliance
Sample Creation Development (with unlimited revisions)
Taxes for Funds Received
PayPal, Credit Card, and IndieGogo Fees
Shipment of Perks - Including Huggable Ruperts

Average completion of the design and manufacture process is 12 weeks - once the order has been placed and payment has been made.
 
You Asked for Rupert
And Oh - how we want to bring him to you!
By contributing $25 or more, you are actually purchasing your own Huggable Rupert in advance.  It's really that simple.
This is my own Huggable Rupert - a very well-loved model from which we are creating a new plush toy for generations of children (and grandchildren!) to come! 
      
 
         
Although this one is smaller than ours will be, this picture should give you a good idea of what we intend to create so (you and) your child can have a furry friend of their own with which to enjoy reading Rupert's Tales.  There many more adventures to come as we look forward to ""Rupert Learns about Making Magick,"" ""The Nature of Elements,"" ""Celebrate Being You,"" and more!
 
Other Ways You Can Help
We relalize some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help.  Please share our campaign with your friends, and family members, and even with those organizations and groups who have folks in them who you know would be interested in having their own Huggable Rupert!
And while you're waiting for yours to hug and hold while you drift off to sleep, maybe this song will help you on your way to sweeter dreams:
Hug Your Rupert

 
Thank you for being a Friend of Rupert!!
 
You Rock!!
 
                                  
 
An Important Update:  
                           
We are pleased to announce we are donating $1 to Circle Sanctuary for every Huggable Rupert sold (or pre-ordered) for as long as they are sold.  We hope that will be a very, very long time to come!  We are delighted to be contributing to an organization which we feel beautifully represents what Rupert brings to the world: acceptance, education, advocacy,understanding.  For more information about the exhaustive listing of what THEY bring to the world, please visit their website here: https://www.circlesanctuary.org/

The labor is documented as an archive of dates in which the artist, referred to in the projects as the writer, thought romantically about two other Palestinian men who also lived in New York. This archive is referred to as love letters, being that love letters are more or less the documentation of emotional labor exchanged between two people. The documentation that both men did not wish to pursue romantic involvement with the writer; it also shows the presence of labor beyond that point. The notebooks which held that documentation of labor were then sent to the men for them to sign, their signatures indicated the end of that labor, and the writer’s ownership of it.<br/>The reclaiming, reenacting, and repurposing of labor, of emotional labor
 more specifically, is as much a question of what labor is as it is of 
how we interact with it as an object. This is especially true when the 
labor’s main presence in the physical world is documentation by the 
laborer. Would the labor documented in this project exist as an object 
that can be reclaimed, reenacted, repurposed, and indeed documented if 
not for the documentation itself? And how do we negotiate the 
representation of tangible objects that document entities that are as 
intangible as the digital, like labor?<br/><br/><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/emotional-labor/id730813244?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The iPad app is available for free on App Store, click here to view it.</a><br/><br/><h3>

<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>L'association des étudiantes et
étudiants en service social du premier cycle <span>(ADESS) organise une exposition d'art permanente à
l'École de service social de l'Université
d'Ottawa. Les fonds amassés seront versés directement aux artistes qui
participeront à l'exposition. Nous avons besoin de vous pour atteindre notre
but de 5000 $ <b>avant le 23 février 2015</b>. Nous vous invitons
aussi à faire circuler cette demande dans vos réseaux. </span></p>
<p>Voici quelques détails relatifs à
l'exposition:</p>
<p>Cette exposition se veut un rappel visuel et quotidien des raisons pour
lesquelles nous avons choisi d'étudier et de travailler dans la profession du
service social, tout en favorisant une collaboration entre différents milieux
académiques et communautaires.</p>

<br/></div>","Bonjour,
L'association des étudiantes et
étudiants en service social du premier cycle (ADESS) organise une exposition d'art permanente à
l'École de service social de l'Université
d'Ottawa. Les fonds amassés seront versés directement aux artistes qui
participeront à l'exposition. Nous avons besoin de vous pour atteindre notre
but de 5000 $ avant le 23 février 2015. Nous vous invitons
aussi à faire circuler cette demande dans vos réseaux. 
Voici quelques détails relatifs à
l'exposition:
Cette exposition se veut un rappel visuel et quotidien des raisons pour
lesquelles nous avons choisi d'étudier et de travailler dans la profession du
service social, tout en favorisant une collaboration entre différents milieux
académiques et communautaires.
Le vernissage de
l'exposition, intitulée Créer pour lutter: l'art au service de la
résistance, est prévu de 14h30 à 16h le 2 mars 2015 dans la
salle de conférence FSS4007, soit immédiatement après la conférence
inaugurale de Dan Bigras pour le lancement officiel de la
semaine nationale du travail social. Cette initiative a reçu l'approbation de
l'École de service social, et du bureau du doyen de la Faculté des sciences
sociales.

<h3>Why We Do It:</h3>
<p>BABY STEPS began as an experiment in maximizing joy:  joy in creating, joy in performing, and (hopefully) joy for our audiences. The act was born from a desire to find more lightness in a world that can feel unbearably heavy, and we quickly learned that this desire resonates with others. Our work theatrically channels messy experiences of being human through our alter egos Sherry and Terry, fraternal twins who have formed an adult contemporary band to inspire the masses. We've learned that we love creating space for a room of strangers to laugh together, and we're eager to bewilder and delight a new audience in New Orleans.</p>
<h3><strong>Who We Are:</strong></h3>
<p>We are Megan Thibodeaux + Andalyn Young, two performance makers based in Philadelphia, PA.  Our diverse backgrounds include work in directing, acting, dance, choreography, clown, mime, design, and some other categories we don't have labels for.  We've combined these influences to form an act that experiments with the conventions of cabaret and stand-up comedy, embracing a fiercely DIY aesthetic that values inventive creativity and wild imagination. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help:</h3>
<p>1.<strong> Donating to this campaign:</strong> Any amount helps. Your donation will directly aid our journey to New Orleans in October. The big costs we are facing include travel, accommodation, rehearsal and production expenses. (There's also the rising cost of mustache glue and cassette tapes, but you probably know that already.)</p>
<p><strong>2. Sharing: </strong>Spread the word of this campaign to others who you think may be interested in supporting our work. They say it takes a village to raise a baby, and this baby is ready to take some first steps outside of Philadelphia...</p>
<p><strong>3. Caring: </strong>Rhymes with Sharing, but is a different step. Whether or not you have the means to donate to our campaign, your encouragement and support is of unparalleled value. To the friends, family, fellow artists, and strangers who have attended our shows and helped develop the work at various stages: we thank you for your time, energy, and love. We will keep making in hopes that you will keep laughing.</p>

Our Story + The Impact




The Temporary is a

This window space acts as a vehicle that engages the diverse audiences that

Jowita Wyszomirska was
born in Poland, immigrated to Chicago in the early 90s and is a recent transplant to Baltimore, Maryland. The experience of relocation, displacement, and immersion into a new

Jowita creates her own way to relate herself to an alien environment. In her

What We Get and What You Get
All

 of the money raised
here will go towards the cost of materials for creating the series of site-specific 
installations and the printing of promotional materials. The installation of the project will take one week beginning Jan. 2nd, 2012. All are invited to come out and see the work in progress!  


As
 an appreciation for your support, you will receive an original drawing from Jowita and an invitation to visit her studio to see new work

</div></div>","RUN WITH RAS!



2016 marks the 3rd consecutive year  Riders Against the Storm has taken home top honors at the Austin Music Awards!  This was accomplished because of the village that continues to raise RAS.   Jumping off from our February RE:Mixtape release, SXSW, and an upcoming tour, we are gearing up for the next leg of our musical journey with you ALL! On August 27 2016,  we are excited to celebrate two incredible milestones: our 3rd annual RAS DAY (headlined by Sun Ra Arkestra), and the release of 'Cornerstone,' our upcoming full-length album.  This record will be wailing with new sounds and songs that we literally cannot WAIT for you to hear. 
Your generous contribution (at any level) takes our movement forward; and your excitement takes it higher. Yes, there are a list of rewards (below) that come with your financial pledge, but we would rather you invest in RAS once you’ve reflected on how much this beloved village has already brought to you and your family.  In 2015, we were able to support 100+ different artists, small business owners, and non-profit organizations that have long been pillars of culture in Austin and beyond.  Our village can do more!  Let's get the more we are asking for!RUN RAS RUN!   OUR NEXT STEPS TOGETHER



$7,000 powers us through the bare bones first phase of recording, mixing, and reproducing 'Cornerstone.'  $4,800 ($400 x 12 songs) to record/mix/master 

$800 'Magik' (first single) music video shoot and edit  
 $600 first run of 500 CDs
 $500 for album promo photo shoot
$300 for album art/design

$10,000 powers all of the above, AND a publicist ($1,000/month x 3 months) to promote the record nationally.
$15,000 powers all of the above, and ensures we have the necessary financial backing to tour during the Fall/Winter (September-November).  This cost includes the production of new merch (tee shirts, posters, and accessories)
$20,000 powers all of the above, AND helps us to enhance the overall production of RAS DAY Festival, offering a secondary national headliner.

<li>
<strong>The miniatures and the giant crab have all been sculpted and cast, so what do you need my money for?</strong>  The master molds have been made but additional funding would enable us to cover the cost of production molds and hopefully add a few more models to the Krackatoan line. Whether the campaign meets its funding or not all orders will be filled!  </li>
<li>
<strong>How do the perks work?</strong>  We have a wide range of perks to suit all budgets from $20 to $250 giving everyone the opportunity to snap up some of these excellent miniatures.  The larger perks are an even better deal as the price of the miniatures is cheaper per pack.  Just click on the Contribute Now bar and select the perk that you want.  Please be aware that each giant crab model equals two packs of Krackatoan figures.</li>
<li>
<strong>How do I let you know which packs I have chosen for my perk?</strong>   You can either send me a message through the Indiegogo site or an email with your selections.  You can do this right away if you know which sets you want, or you can wait until the end of the campaign and also select from any stretch goals which have been unlocked.</li>
<li>
<strong>When will I get my figures?</strong>   It will take approximately 2 months after the campaign has ended before orders are sent out.  International orders outside the USA please allow 10-12 weeks for delivery, although in most instances your perk is likely to arrive much sooner.</li>
<li>
<strong>How will my figures be packed?</strong>   The Krackatoan metal miniatures are sealed individually in plastic bags using a Grizzly heat-sealer.  This method helps to protect each figure and makes it more economical to mail out.  The giant crabs are multi-part resin models and will be packed in a box unassembled.</li>
<li>
<strong>How much is postage?</strong>   For U.S. contributors postage is FREE!  The postage for International contributors is listed under each perk.  U.S. orders are sent out using regular US Mail.  International orders are sent by standard airmail.  <em>Please be aware that if you want your perk sent by signed, tracked or special delivery this will be at your own cost.  Please contact me about the price of special delivery if you want your perk sent this way.</em><br/>

</div></div>","Greetings and welcome to Dragon Bait Miniatures third Indiegogo campaign: The Krackatoan Warband.  The Krackatoans are a fearsome aquatic race of evil fish-men who dwell deep below the murky depths of a dark sea.  They are equipped with an array of formidable weapons and are known to be blood thirsty and savage fighters, ever on the prowl for unsuspecting victims whom they capture and devour.  Entire coastlines have been ravaged by the Krackatoans sudden and ferocious attacks . . . it is sometimes said they are accompanied by monstrous crustaceans whom they ride into battle like trained war elephants!  If your adventurers are looking for a new challenge - the Krackatoans have arrived!The goal of Dragon Bait is to bring original, well designed and high quality pewter fantasy miniatures to the table top.  To help me in this quest I have had the good fortune to work with an exceptionally talented (and somewhat demented) band of rogues who all contributed to bring these amazing miniatures into being.  The veteran sculptor, Tim Prow, sculpted all of the Krackatoans.  Never did a more ferocious band of sea creatures rise from the murky depths.  Andy 'Beast Master' Pieper took on the formidable task of creating a monstrous giant crab to serve as the Krackatoans death-dealing battle mount.  The multi-talented Dave Soderquist, not only overcame diverse casting challenges in both resin and pewter, but also sculpted a truly enchanting mermaid, which is this campaign's reward figure for returning contributors.  Rob from Pennyfew painting did an amazing job bringing the Krackatoans and crab to life with his incredible painting skills.  Last but not least is Dr Mike Burns, a good friend and concept artist who's imagination helped get this project off the ground. 


The Krackatoans were all sculpted by the talented Tim Prow and have been cast in a lead-free tin alloy.  The miniatures range in size from 28 to 32mm and are incredibley well detailed, each also comes with a separate pewter base.  The giant crab was sculpted by the very skilful Andy Pieper and is a large multi-part resin model which will require assembly.  The giant crab model counts as two packs of miniatures when selecting your perks.

<h2>
<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Marx Project</span><br/>
</h2>
<p>My name is Mark Phillips and I'm an artist working in metal and adapting traditional printmaking techniques to metal working.  Back in February I started to develop a project using metal and new digital tools to make art and to bring to light Organ Donation.  In 1993 my Father died and his organs were donated.  Since that time I've often 
wondered about the people that received his organs and how I viewed this
 medical miracle. In our modern world the act of organ donation saves 
lives and in a very real sense extends the donor’s life as a piece of 
the donor lives on. This amazing feat begins by merely checking a box on a driver’s license
 for many; a simple stroke of the pen. Shouldn't it be more celebrated and illuminated in art?  I think so.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>To bring this project to life I am building a CNC (Computer Numeric Controlled) Router  to aid in the creation of the metal art pieces. The CNC Router (similar to the one in the video above) will be able to cut any complexity of shape following a computer generated file.  The plates will be cut much 
like a free-form jigsaw puzzle or stained glass window where individual pieces 
lock into one plane. The work will incorporate deep etched lines, subtle
 photo etched detail elements, engraved repeating patterns, enamels, patinas and bright 
anodized colors accentuating the work.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My gallery in Chicago is open to having an event at the 
completion of the series in 2012 with an auction to benefit Organ 
Donation in Illinois.  Whether I reach my funding goal in 40 odd days or
 not, since IndoeGoGo allows for flexible funding, I am able to use all 
the funds raised to immediately buy 
parts needed for the CNC Router and complete the artwork.  The art show 
date will be scheduled once the router is up and running and the art 
pieces begin taking shape.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This project has been rolling around in my mind for many years but it
 has taken a long time to develop the skills and techniques necessary to 
execute the pieces as I've envisioned. Now I just need time and a little
 funding for materials to get the CNC built and finally move this project beyond my sketchbook and into 
reality.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""font-style: italic;"">Where it's Headed - The Build Blog - The Final Art Fabrication - The Show/Auction Benefit </h2>My father was a 
machinist and as a kid I was always fascinated visiting the factory 
floor and watching him transform hunks of metal on a CNC milling machine and metal lathe
into something beautiful.  I hope to instill that sense of wonder at witnessing the act of creation in my 
audience.  The public will be able to track the progress and watch videos of the router producing many of the parts and pictures of me assembling the pieces for the Organ Donation Show on the blogsite <a href=""http://digitalmarx.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://digitalmarx.blogspot.com/</a>.<br/><br/><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.graphicmarx.com/parkredcommissionbuild.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 844px; height: 188px;""/><br/><br/><br/><p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Marx Project

My name is Mark Phillips and I'm an artist working in metal and adapting traditional printmaking techniques to metal working.  Back in February I started to develop a project using metal and new digital tools to make art and to bring to light Organ Donation.  In 1993 my Father died and his organs were donated.  Since that time I've often 
wondered about the people that received his organs and how I viewed this
 medical miracle. In our modern world the act of organ donation saves 
lives and in a very real sense extends the donor’s life as a piece of 
the donor lives on. This amazing feat begins by merely checking a box on a driver’s license
 for many; a simple stroke of the pen. Shouldn't it be more celebrated and illuminated in art?  I think so.

To bring this project to life I am building a CNC (Computer Numeric Controlled) Router  to aid in the creation of the metal art pieces. The CNC Router (similar to the one in the video above) will be able to cut any complexity of shape following a computer generated file.  The plates will be cut much 
like a free-form jigsaw puzzle or stained glass window where individual pieces 
lock into one plane. The work will incorporate deep etched lines, subtle
 photo etched detail elements, engraved repeating patterns, enamels, patinas and bright 
anodized colors accentuating the work.  

My gallery in Chicago is open to having an event at the 
completion of the series in 2012 with an auction to benefit Organ 
Donation in Illinois.  Whether I reach my funding goal in 40 odd days or
 not, since IndoeGoGo allows for flexible funding, I am able to use all 
the funds raised to immediately buy 
parts needed for the CNC Router and complete the artwork.  The art show 
date will be scheduled once the router is up and running and the art 
pieces begin taking shape.

This project has been rolling around in my mind for many years but it
 has taken a long time to develop the skills and techniques necessary to 
execute the pieces as I've envisioned. Now I just need time and a little
 funding for materials to get the CNC built and finally move this project beyond my sketchbook and into 
reality.


Where it's Headed - The Build Blog - The Final Art Fabrication - The Show/Auction Benefit My father was a 
machinist and as a kid I was always fascinated visiting the factory 
floor and watching him transform hunks of metal on a CNC milling machine and metal lathe
into something beautiful.  I hope to instill that sense of wonder at witnessing the act of creation in my 
audience.  The public will be able to track the progress and watch videos of the router producing many of the parts and pictures of me assembling the pieces for the Organ Donation Show on the blogsite http://digitalmarx.blogspot.com/.


What the Project Needs to Get it Rolling

Computer aided production and assembly has been around for several 
decades in manufacturing yet only now are these tools within reach of artists.  
Here's a link to the CNC kit I'm building (example pictured below but mine wont be John Deere colors). I've already purchased the plans and the basic Hybrid R&P Router kit but there are a lot of things I need to get still. Play the video here, it's amazing.

<p>At the beginning of July, I got into the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp.<br/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/777988/files/20140810085332-List_za_wiadczaj_cy_o_dostaniu_si__na_studia.jpg?1407686012"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For many years, I have been working very hard to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, my family is not able to fully finance my education in Belgium.<br/><br/></p>
<p>I've always had an interest in fashion, becoming seriously passionate about 5 years ago. The first step was to attend the patternmaking and sewing course in Youth Cultural House in my hometown, Bialystok.<br/><br/><br/>Since 2010, I’ve been doing summer internships annually. For a couple of years it was at Maldoror Low Couture in Warsaw. </p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>I am constantly improving and honing my skills by taking part in different contests. I was the finalist of Young Fashion Day Competition and semi-finalist of OFF FASHION Competition.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/749908/files/20140728145137-5_slajd.jpg?1406584297"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>One of my biggest achievements was being awarded a second prize in an international competition for a historical reconstruction of Helena Modjeska dress.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>Apart from the pursuit of fashion design I was also involved in charity projects, supporting the non-profit organization such as The Grand Orchestra of Christmas Charity. As a reward for my involvement in this charity event I was chosen as one of two workshop participants who were given the opportunity to work on the “Tubakire Project” organized by the Christian Charity Service and ADRA Poland foundation supported by the Polish Foreign Minister. In relation to the project’s mission aimed at exploration of the value that lies in multiculturalism and humanity, together with the other participant, we sewed the traditional national Polish costume worn in the region of Kurpie, which was later donated for children with special educational needs in Rwanda. <br/></p>

<div>
<p>Studying at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp is the next step in achieving my dream and building a successful future. Please, help me up to fulfil it. I count on you and your support!</p>
<p>The first year of college costs about 15 thousand Euros. This price includes the tuition fee, accommodation, food, fabrics and other core study materials essential to study at the Academy.</p>
<p>I am aware that this is quite a large sum, however I strongly believe that you can help me collect the fund that would allow me continue my path.</p>
<p>I'm going to use my art to express gratitude in return for your support! I'm offering plenty of analogue and polaroid pictures (especially some new ones from Antwerp!), custom collages, drawings and designs!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary My name is Pawel Androsiuk and I’m a 19 year old aspiring Polish designer from Bialystok.





At the beginning of July, I got into the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp.



For many years, I have been working very hard to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, my family is not able to fully finance my education in Belgium.
I've always had an interest in fashion, becoming seriously passionate about 5 years ago. The first step was to attend the patternmaking and sewing course in Youth Cultural House in my hometown, Bialystok.Since 2010, I’ve been doing summer internships annually. For a couple of years it was at Maldoror Low Couture in Warsaw. 



Last year, I interned at Malgorzata Dudek Atelier in London.




I am constantly improving and honing my skills by taking part in different contests. I was the finalist of Young Fashion Day Competition and semi-finalist of OFF FASHION Competition.





One of my biggest achievements was being awarded a second prize in an international competition for a historical reconstruction of Helena Modjeska dress.







Apart from the pursuit of fashion design I was also involved in charity projects, supporting the non-profit organization such as The Grand Orchestra of Christmas Charity. As a reward for my involvement in this charity event I was chosen as one of two workshop participants who were given the opportunity to work on the “Tubakire Project” organized by the Christian Charity Service and ADRA Poland foundation supported by the Polish Foreign Minister. In relation to the project’s mission aimed at exploration of the value that lies in multiculturalism and humanity, together with the other participant, we sewed the traditional national Polish costume worn in the region of Kurpie, which was later donated for children with special educational needs in Rwanda. 




What I Need & What You Get


Studying at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp is the next step in achieving my dream and building a successful future. Please, help me up to fulfil it. I count on you and your support!
The first year of college costs about 15 thousand Euros. This price includes the tuition fee, accommodation, food, fabrics and other core study materials essential to study at the Academy.
I am aware that this is quite a large sum, however I strongly believe that you can help me collect the fund that would allow me continue my path.
I'm going to use my art to express gratitude in return for your support! I'm offering plenty of analogue and polaroid pictures (especially some new ones from Antwerp!), custom collages, drawings and designs!

Here are some examples:

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Michael, and I'm an alcoholic and a drug addict. I've struggled with depression, anxiety and alcohol and drug addiction for over 20 years. The good news is that I'm now in recovery, and I'm currently 4 months clean and sober!</p>
<p>Coming out of treatment and going back to work, I quickly realized that my work environment was not a healthy one, and that I needed to make a career change if I was going to completely stay on track in my recovery. Right around the time I was realizing this, some very good friends of mine took me out to dinner to congratulate me on my sobriety and to catch up. I informed them of my work situation, and without hesitation, my friend Mark Mertins said to me ""Don't ever think you don't have somewhere to go."" Mark is the owner of a successful General Contracting company and a Custom Cabinet shop, and is a very talented woodworker. He invited me to come give him a hand at his shop if I needed some work.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few weeks, and I did in fact quit my job and was looking for work. What I anticipated to be a quick couple week temporary job at Mark's shop quickly steered me towards starting my own Carpentry company. I fell in love with the work, and Mark was willing to continue to teach me as we went along, so I could do contract work for him while also working on getting my own business started.</p>
<p>My reasoning for starting this campaign is to get my new business some startup funds by selling my famous Woodblock Keychains. I say ""famous"", only because this is an old idea I came up with all the way back in High School. I worked at a small lumber yard back then, and when it was slow one day an idea popped into my head to use the scrap cut-off pieces of oak to create Woodblock Keychains.</p>
<p>I made these keychains because I always noticed that when someone jinxed themselves and needed to ""knock on wood"" to counteract the jinx, inevitably the only thing around was some plastic, formica or other non-wood material. Now to those of us that are superstitious, this is not cool. When wood needs to be knocked there's a time limit to find it. (Roughly 15 seconds) My solution is the Woodblock Keychain. That way you have a nice jinx erasing piece of wood on you at all times. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Blocks</h3>
<p>Part of my woodworking endeavor is going to be gathering the waste materials from large projects and creating unique custom items from them. This is material that would otherwise collect dust in the corner of the shop or end up as kindling. The blocks will all be handmade from recovered materials. These are the leftovers from very high end custom cabinet and furniture builds. The type of wood will vary depending on what I can get, but they will all be high quality.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Because Mental Health and Addiction is so personal to me, I will be donating $1 from every block sold to a charitable fund that I will be starting called 'Building Recovery'. The idea is to start small and build funds to cover all the legal aspects of starting a charitable foundation. Once this is covered and Building Recovery is established, we can start raising more awareness and donations, and the main focus will be to create a enough funding to start a construction trade training facility that will give people returning to work after treatment a chance to come and learn a trade while working and earning a decent wage. I see and hear every day how finding skilled tradesmen is getting more and more difficult as time goes by. I want to give trades a boost while also giving people starting over a chance to learn new skills and make a living.</p>
<p>I want to do for others what Mark has done for me. I wake up excited to go to work and to learn new things. This opportunity has been so valuable to my recovery that I strongly believe, that if given the same chance, many others in my situation would thrive as well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Full Disclosure</h3>
<p>Yes, I am running a for profit business, and selling these items will benefit me personally. I'm not doing this as a boo hoo for myself, or using a charity to push my personal gain. It's quite the opposite. Yes, I need a new career and this is the launch, but I also want to help others while doing it. My company will continue to donate to this cause for as long as it is around, whether that be one week or 100 years.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't want any of the items, or don't have the money, but you would still like to help raise awareness for Mental Health &amp; Addiction, then please send me a message and maybe we can collaborate. </p>

<h3>What is Cloud 9? </h3>
<p>Cloud 9 is a beautiful, functional interactive art experience for EVERYONE on the playa to enjoy. She is a mobile sanctuary for anyone she encounters, who might wish or need a plush, fun filled, luxurious ride on the playa. With a well appointed sound system, blankets and pillows for cold deep playa nights and whimsically gracious hosts, we hope to offer an experience that is nothing short of heavenly!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who are the Geishas?</h3>
<p><span>Geisha House has been providing a fur &amp; velvet lined air-conditioned sanctuary with free flowing sake and a friendly welcoming vibe on the Playa, for over a decade. In 2012, we successfully brought our first Art Car, Cloud 9. </span> We are a small camp of hard working burners who pride ourselves in building cool shit for all to enjoy.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why we need your help</h3>
<p>We would love to bring Cloud 9 back for her second year on the Playa  To make that happen, we need your generous support for the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cleanng/maintenance of Cloud 9</li>
<li>Repair of Cloud 9's lights - a good time was had by all in 2012 and she certainly needs a little post party love in preparation for 2013. We did not anticipate wear and tear on our lights, so this part of Cloud 9 will undergo re-design and renovation.</li>
<li>Transport to and from the Playa.</li>
<li>Fuel for operations on Playa.</li>
</ol>
<p>The costs for the car, much of the materials to build it/pimp it out, the workshop/tools, the time, effort and love invested in building Cloud 9 was largely donated by the Geisha's in 2012. The cost to store Cloud 9 is also being absorbed by the Geisha's.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why, why, and why? </h3>
<p>We believe Black Rock City needs fantastic art and fabulous Art Cars. So, we built one and we'd love to bring her back and share it with you all. </p>
<p>Cloud 9 provides the opportunity to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be creative and whimsical.</li>
<li>Share and participate in community</li>
<li>Make and share Art, at one of the most unique events in the world</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks for your support. See you at Black Rock! </p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And that’s all there is to it.</p></div>","What is Cloud 9?

In 2012, we successfully brought our first Art Car, Cloud 9.  We are a small camp of hard working burners who pride ourselves in building cool shit for all to enjoy.


Why we need your help
We would love to bring Cloud 9 back for her second year on the Playa  To make that happen, we need your generous support for the following:

Cleanng/maintenance of Cloud 9
Repair of Cloud 9's lights - a good time was had by all in 2012 and she certainly needs a little post party love in preparation for 2013. We did not anticipate wear and tear on our lights, so this part of Cloud 9 will undergo re-design and renovation.
Transport to and from the Playa.
Fuel for operations on Playa.

The costs for the car, much of the materials to build it/pimp it out, the workshop/tools, the time, effort and love invested in building Cloud 9 was largely donated by the Geisha's in 2012. The cost to store Cloud 9 is also being absorbed by the Geisha's.


Why, why, and why? 
We believe Black Rock City needs fantastic art and fabulous Art Cars. So, we built one and we'd love to bring her back and share it with you all. 
Cloud 9 provides the opportunity to:

Be creative and whimsical.
Share and participate in community
Make and share Art, at one of the most unique events in the world

 
Thanks for your support. See you at Black Rock! 


And that’s all there is to it.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Boner Remembrance Day© (or BRD for short) is an enchanted event thrown by the Badger's© to remember their friend, teammate and lover, The Boner.</p>
<p><em>(Disclaimer: Dave Bonaparte is still very much alive)</em></p>
<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
<p>So here's the deal, ordinarily we hold the event in one of our backyards, but honestly, it's gotten to the point where none of our parents are comfortable with having a group of grown men celebrating a 'boner night' anywhere on their property. We see their point...</p>
<p>Doesn't matter though, we will adapt. <strong>We're moving to a venue.</strong> A classy as shit one. Problem is, we need your help...</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>Money</li>
</ul><p>It's that simple folks. Fact is, venues cost money. Money that a couple of twenty-four year old dipshits just don't have. What with that whole recession and the stock markets and you know, 401k's and Obama and stuff, we unfortunately don't have enough money to cover the costs ourselves like we usually do. Alas, that's where you come in...  </p>
<h3>The Impact You'll Make By Helping</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your donation will help cover the cost of renting a private venue equipped with booze, music and food. </li>
</ul><p>We plan to make BRD VI as classy-- nay, <em>classier</em> than each of its predeccesors. By doing so we'll need enough money to lock down a decidant spot in either <strong>New York City</strong> or one of its fine neiboring cities <em>(excluding Newark, of course)</em>. </p>
<p>I assure you, your contributions won't go unnoticed and can really go long way.</p>
<h3>The Impact You'll Make By NOT Helping</h3>
<ul>
<li>BRD will be <strong>cancelled</strong>
</li>
</ul><p>Yup. I hope everyone understands the severity of the situation. It's a hard pill to swallow, but the fact remains; venues are <em>expensive</em>.</p>
<p><em>""But Badgers, why can't you just spring for a shittier venue?"", </em>some of you may ask. Allow us to answer your question with another question: ""<em>How dare you?"" </em>This is BRD you jabroni, a no expense spared extraviganza that rivals Royal Weddings and Puff Daddy Parties. We would never disrespect Boner or his legacy by lowering our standards and half-assing BRD. You deserve better. We all deserve better. </p>

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>To be Black, woman* and alive. Living at the intersections of gender and race, Black women, Black trans women, Black girls, and Black femmes are not protected or valued. As a community, it is our duty to create spaces where Black women* are centered, cared for and our voices are uplifted and heard. My name is Arvia Walker and I'm a visual storyteller and community organizer that centers my work on Black women and girls.*</p>
<p>#DearBlackGirl is a community-curated, love note-portrait project that is centered on cultivating joy, healing, beauty, and the magic of Black women and girls*. Together we will co-create a collection of love letters that are written by and for Black women and girls*. Alongside them, we will have portraits taken in a celebration of our magic. My hope is that this will be a community affirmation project where Black women* will feel loved and held.</p>
<p>These love note sessions will be provided free to community members in New Haven and Hartford in early Fall 2018. This is why your donation is so important. Any amount is appreciated and I thank you in advance.</p>

We've got the dream; you've got the means!

Black Belt Treasures Cultural Arts Center (BBTCAC) has the opportunity to involve the community while restoring hope and strengthening the economic foundation in Alabama’s rural
Black Belt through the arts - but we need YOUR help!Our Story...Black Belt Treasures Cultural Arts
Center (BBTCAC) is on a journey to accomplish a dream - the establishment of a Black Belt Art House – Pottery
Station, a creative educational space used to keep the rich culture and history alive, which the Black Belt region was founded upon.   
As we begin our tenth year as a non-profit, BBTCAC is proud to have a relationship with more than 450 artists and craftsmen from across Alabama's economically challenged Black Belt region, with visits from tourists from all 50 states and 23 foreign countries, and countless arts education experiences for youth and adults.     Does our journey reflect success? YES, definitely! Are we there yet? No, there are many miles to go! Won't you help us complete this leg of the journey?The Space...The current BBTCAC campus
includes a partially renovated car dealership; the renovated front portion is a
beautiful gallery, office space, with limited teaching space, while the back
portion of the facility (6500 sq. ft.) is the former auto shop and currently
used as storage space (referred to by BBTCAC staff as the warehouse). Concept
drawings have been prepared by Auburn University architecture students for
re-purposing the warehouse space in order to provide artist work-spaces where they may work creatively while growing their
businesses and developing unique products, and to allow for vibrant educational
experiences (classes, workshops, exhibits, festival events, music, dance, and dramatic performances) for visitors, hands-on learners, and arts consumers. A portion of this expanded space will house our Pottery Station.    Alabama's Black Belt region has a
strong arts heritage, including folk and Native American pottery, and
contemporary artists - with the top
selling medium and artists being ceramics.  We have chosen to begin our expansion with
pottery because of its popularity, demand from consumers and tourists, and
availability of qualified staff instructors to implement a strong educational
program focused on ceramic arts.
What We Need...We will form a Pottery Station complete
with artist studio space, learning space, and equipment. Our ideal Pottery
Station will include 10 fully equipped pottery wheel areas, a glazing station,
and a minimum of two kilns for a total estimated cost of $25,000. While this is our dream, we are willing to start small and build as we grow. So our over all project will be accomplished in four phases. In Phase One, with your help, we will purchase four Brent Wheels, basic classroom tools and equipment, and enough clay and glazes to get started. As
demand grows, future funding will be sought to complete the establishment of
the “ideal” Pottery Station and ultimately the entire Black Belt ArtHouse.Let us break down for you just what we need to get started: 

4 Brent wheels


Pottery wheel work stations complete with stool, table, storage and tools

Canvas covered classroom tables

Drying racks  2 have been donated - Will now purchase a clay safe sink

Clay and glazes to get started
This will help us start teaching classes to the adult who has no access to equipment or tools, the youth who has little to no art classes in the schools, and the tourist who wishes to learn while on vacation. All of these will not only bring access to the learner, but will create a cycle of economic impact in one of the most impoverished areas of the United States. From small business opportunity to tourism dollars, the POWER OF ART will ignite change - all starting with your donation.   What's the Impact...This project is about more than just buying equipment and re-purposing space. It is about providing opportunity for individuals of all ages and walks of life to enjoy learning a new craft, perfect their skills, build their portfolios, and potentially become entrepreneurs as they sell their works of art.     BBTCAC is the centerpiece of an arts economy revitalization involving artist development and arts education located in the heart of Alabama's Black Belt. A region rich in cultural heritage, bountiful in natural resources and gifted, diverse group of artists, it is also one of the most impoverished areas in America. This ArtHouse will provide room and equipment that has not been available before. It will provide room and equipment for expanded arts education opportunities (classes, workshops), community arts presentations (theater, music, literary readings), and exhibits. The opportunities are endless as well as the potential in our community. 
This small expansion is the start to a new beginning and continued economic growth to the area; it is much more than just art. 
Join of us on this journey to mould opportunities for current and future artists!What You Get...
Satisfaction - you know, that warm, fuzzy feeling in the cockles of your soul!
An assortment of BBTCAC logo items just to keep us on your mind and to show you how appreciative we are of you!

<p>Al momento abbiamo un buco di € 2100 che speriamo di coprire con il vostro aiuto. Speriamo in oltre di riuscire ad avere maggiori entrate attraverso il F&amp;B e la LOTTERIA, ma non è una certezza. </p>
<p>In ogni caso se dovessimo raccogliere più fondi di quanti ce ne servono, questi saranno utilizzati dall'associazione per i laboratori che si organizzeranno in inverno.</p>
<p>Se invece non dovessimo raggiungere il budget previsto saremo indebitati e copriremo le spese con fondi personali nell'arco dei mesi successivi all'evento. </p>
<p>Noi organizzatori non percepiamo nessun rimborso per il lavoro che svolgiamo nel organizzare e allestire MostrArci.</p>
<p>Già è capitato in passato di dover rimetterci con i nostri fondi personali derivanti dal proprio lavoro (quando c'è). Purtroppo è una condizione da accettare se si ha davvero la voglia di contribuire alla crescita del nostro territorio, giacchè le istituzioni locali non contribuiscono abbastanza.</p>
<p>Quest'anno contiamo su di voi e speriamo che il crowdfounding sia la giusta risposta alla nostra richiesta di aiuto.</p>

Associazione  di Promozione Sociale “ARCI RUOTI”
L’associazione nasce nel 2010 ad opera del socio fondatore Giulio Troiano con lo scopo di contribuire allo sviluppo culturale del Comune di Ruoti (PZ) , interessandosi principalmente alle giovani generazioni.
 Attraverso una programmazione mensile, l’associazione ha messo in opera diversi laboratori, attività ed eventi per bambini e adulti, anche con l’intento di mettere a confronto diverse generazioni (Carro di Carnevale, Attività ludiche per bambini, Giochi di società con premiazioni, Scambio-libro, Filmarci ed altro).
  Con tali finalità è stato creato l’evento multiculturale “Mostr’Arci”.
 
MISSION
INTERNAZIONALIZZAZIONE
Mostrarci è un crogiuolo di arti , artigianato, sapori e tradizioni del territorio, nel quale convergono anche esperienze trasversali provenienti da  tutto il mondo.
L’evento nasce come uno spazio aperto a tutte le arti, che mette in risalto le risorse culturali del territorio in cui viviamo, e che offre una possibilità di confronto  tra realtà lucane e  internazionali.
Nelle tre edizioni passate Mostrarci ha accolto artisti provenienti non solo da tutta Italia  ma anche dal Giappone, dalla Spagna, e quest’anno anche dalla Francia e dal Regno Unito.
 
TURISMO ESPERIENZIALE
Tutto il festival è organizzato in modo da coinvolgere emotivamente e partecipativamente la popolazione locale e i turisti, al fine di evidenziare come una partecipazione dinamica e attiva favorisce un miglioramento della vita socio-culturale e emotiva. L’evento è costruito secondo il principio dell’autoproduzione e della sostenibilità , concetti che verranno trasmessi ai fruitori in maniera pratica grazie ai workshop gratuiti, e alle pratiche di riciclo denominate  “Il rifiuto è un guadagno”. Gli spettacoli degli artisti di strada favoriscono ulteriormente la partecipazione attiva dei turisti.
 


CONCEPT EDIZIONE 2013
Il Festival delle Autoproduzioni e delle  Arti di Strada
L’autoproduzione è la caratterizzazione del festival, un principio messo in opera per uscire dalle grandi catene di business, partendo dai concetti di  chilometro zero, artigianale, biologico, biodinamico, di riciclo e riuso, e ecosostenibilità.
Le arti di strada sono state incluse perché sono iniezioni di creatività, gioco, espressione artistica, interazione e partecipazione, tutti concetti fondamentali nell’esecuzione delle “buone pratiche”.
 
OBBIETTIVI
Ogni anno ci siamo proposti di ampliare e migliorare il festival,  farlo conoscere a più persone possibili, sia per ampliare la partecipazione locale, sia per allargare gli interventi internazionali.
Gli obbiettivi dell’edizione 2013 del festival si possono riassumere nei seguenti punti:

 Espandere la portata del piano di comunicazione
 Ampliare l’offerta proposta al pubblico
 Offrire momenti di confronto e scambio esperienziale tra  generazioni, e tra persone con diversi background culturali
 Fornire spunti di sopravvivenza urbana (autoproduzione, riciclo creativo)
 Valorizzare il patrimonio culturale (centro storico, cantine aperte, sapori tradizionali)

Buone idee e buone intenzioni sono alla portata di tutti, ma mezzi e fondi li hanno solo in pochi ed è per questo che serve anche il tuo aiuto.
 

Di cosa abbiamo bisogno e perchè:
 
Le nostre spese:
F&B...................................€  800
ARTISTI.............................€1850
AMMINISTRATVE.................€ 1150
ATTREZZATURE...................€  1550
PUBBLICITA'.......................€ 1400
I nostri fondi:
SPONSOR..........................€ 1200
LOTTERIA..........................€  750
INCASSI PREVISTI F&B........€ 1700
Al momento abbiamo un buco di € 2100 che speriamo di coprire con il vostro aiuto. Speriamo in oltre di riuscire ad avere maggiori entrate attraverso il F&B e la LOTTERIA, ma non è una certezza. 
In ogni caso se dovessimo raccogliere più fondi di quanti ce ne servono, questi saranno utilizzati dall'associazione per i laboratori che si organizzeranno in inverno.
Se invece non dovessimo raggiungere il budget previsto saremo indebitati e copriremo le spese con fondi personali nell'arco dei mesi successivi all'evento. 
Noi organizzatori non percepiamo nessun rimborso per il lavoro che svolgiamo nel organizzare e allestire MostrArci.
Già è capitato in passato di dover rimetterci con i nostri fondi personali derivanti dal proprio lavoro (quando c'è). Purtroppo è una condizione da accettare se si ha davvero la voglia di contribuire alla crescita del nostro territorio, giacchè le istituzioni locali non contribuiscono abbastanza.
Quest'anno contiamo su di voi e speriamo che il crowdfounding sia la giusta risposta alla nostra richiesta di aiuto.

HOUSE 2015</b> needs your help to transform unusual and
unexpected spaces into our events venues. 
Most dramatically we want to convert a derelict old wood yard into our
pop-up cinema so we can show a programme of rarely seen films of protest.<br/></p><p>The idea for the HOUSE 2015 cinema
programme evolved out of the theme <i>Edge and Shift, </i>introduced by this year’s lead artist Nathan
Coley<i>. </i>His new
commission <i>Portraits of Dissension</i> looks
at links between the destruction and renovation of architecture in the
aftermath of political acts, and how we manifest answers physically in the
world.</p>
<p>In the face of dissension, protest often
provides the necessary edge that leads to change. <b> The Cinema of Re-Enactment </b>grew
out of these themes and through collaboration with Cinecity we put together a
season of films spanning seven decades of cinematic history.  </p>
<p>The programme will include Jeremy Deller
and Mike Figgis’ <i>Battle of Ogreave</i>,
Peter Watkins’ <i>Culloden</i>, Humprey
Jennings’ <i>Silent Village</i>, the
astonishing Indonesian film<i> The Act of
Killing</i>, local archive footage and two artist shorts that inspired the work
of some HOUSE 2015 artists.</p>
<p>Other highlights will include an <i>In Conversation </i>with lead artist Nathan

<p>The reason this
project is so valuable is because such a consequential city has never had such

a cultural resource for the metro region, and export the finer aspects of
Detroit culture from coast to coast. The magazine is a vessel for collaboration and a stimulator for creation. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>We already have
designed, edited, and labored over our first issue! Many talented people have been involved with this first issue. Now is the time to raise
the funds to release it! Without your support we can't complete what took almost a year to source and design. One of our greatest challenges is keeping printing quality high and keeping the price of the magazine affordable.</p>

If you give $1000 or more, you get all of the above perks, the 2nd issue free, and Other Studio will do a design project for you.


The Perk Artwork
Designed and illustrated from some of the best in the industry, in return for your donations we will be turning these pieces of art into bookmarks and possibly art prints! We'll send a little bit of Detroit to you!









    The Impact 
The reason this
project is so valuable is because such a consequential city has never had such
a large void. Our mission is to repair the stigmatized name of the city, create
a cultural resource for the metro region, and export the finer aspects of
Detroit culture from coast to coast. The magazine is a vessel for collaboration and a stimulator for creation.    Risks & Challenges  
We already have
designed, edited, and labored over our first issue! Many talented people have been involved with this first issue. Now is the time to raise
the funds to release it! Without your support we can't complete what took almost a year to source and design. One of our greatest challenges is keeping printing quality high and keeping the price of the magazine affordable.
   Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't contribute toward our printing, that doesn't mean you can't help! Please help spread the word about Grand Circus Magazine!

<div>La photographie des proches apparaît à la toute fin des années 1970 et se développe dans les années 1980. Héritière de la photographie de famille, elle regroupe des artistes qui, témoignant des transformations sociales et morales modernes, s'en emparent et les montrent. Les images qu'ils proposent au public naissent de leurs milieux, de leurs relations ; elles interrogent les notions très hétéronormées de l'intimité, de la sexualité, du genre. Une nouvelle transparence et la liberté de dévoiler ce qui fait et ce qu'est le privé se cristallisent lorsque des artistes comme Clark, Goldin et Tillmans décident de montrer ce qui jusqu'alors était caché : l'intime. Leurs proches comme sujet, leur quotidien comme temporalité rendent compte d'une nouvelle façon de penser la photographie – elle n'est plus un souvenir, elle est la relation.
 
C'est dans ce genre photographique que j'ai développé ma pratique. La diffusion par le biais d'un petit livre entre les mains du regardeur tente de recréer ce lien intime qui me lie avec mes sujets photographiés. Des sujets photographiés jusqu'au choix de l'imprimerie parisienne, en passant par le graphisme, le livre se révèle comme une multitude d'amitiés. <br/>

Choosing close friends as subjects became a trend in photography in the late 1970s, which at first borrowed the codes of family pictures, and developed further in the 1980s. Artists witnessed the social and moral transformations of the times, and gathered together to take hold of them and display them. They took images from their background and their relationships and showed them to the world to question the heteronormative notions of intimacy, sexuality, and gender. Artists such as Clark, Goldin, and Tillmans decided to show what was hidden until then – intimacy – and gave shape to a new transparency, and to the freedom to unveil what defines private life. Their subjects (their closest friends) and their temporality (their daily life) describe a new way to think photography – not as a memory, but as the relationship itself.

My practice has evolved within this photographic genre. Releasing a little book that can find its place in the hands of the viewer is for me a way to recreate the intimate link between my subjects and me. From my subjects to the style of the book, or to the Parisian printing house, this book presents itself as a collection of friendships.</span></div>

<div>   When I was in high school, I took my first ceramics class. I found that ceramics was the first artistic outlet where my creativity blossomed. I practiced for two years, taking all of the levels offered, including hand-building and a sculpture class. Before my senior year, the ceramic professor kindly created an Advanced Ceramics class for a group of very eager ceramic-loving students, including myself, who had already taken all of his classes. This class was very free-style, consisted primarily of wheel throwing and occasional lecture. My first raku, horse hair, firing was in this class. </div>
<div>   During my very busy college years, I hadn't had the opportunity of taking another ceramics class. Currently, now that I'm feeling settled down from graduating and getting into the flow of the working life, I decided to take a ceramics class with a good friend. This was mainly a treat for myself during the dark, chilly days of winter and to re-establish a former passion. As I hoped, centering the damp clay beneath my grip was ingrained in my muscle memory. </div>
<div>   This beginners class is taught by Jeremy Ayers through Burlington City Arts (BCA) at the Main Street Clay Studio. After relearning old techniques I had once known, learning new techniques and surrounding myself with inspirational ceramic artists, my 8-week class is coming to a close. As I am still practicing glazing and my mind is flowing with more education and ideas on how to improve my pottery skills, I've realized that I need to continue practicing ceramics. </div>
<h2><b>The Next Step and How You Can Help</b></h2>
<div>   My spirit has been jumping for joy and taking this class has opened up a door of growing excitement that I do not want to close again. The mindfulness of the art of wheel throwing has made me very excited, it has centered my well being, encouraged my creativity and put me more at peace with stresses in my life. Ceramics has given me an opportunity to do something on my own, branch out with other people of the community and feel more apart of Burlington. In many ways, it's extremely important to many aspects of my life. </div>
<div>   My plan is to rent studio space during this summer, until the next level ceramics class is offered. This is likely 3-6 months until the next class. The fall / winter class schedules have not been posted yet but they do happen at least once annually. I'm not sure what other modalities are like, but I have found that ceramics cost a little bit more than I can afford currently. Below is the BCA's rent rates and benefits of a studio space: </div>
<div>
<p><strong>STUDIO RATES</strong></p>
<p>Clay Studio rental costs $55 per month with discounts available for the purchase of rental in 3, 6 and 12 month increments.</p>
<p>- 1 month - $55 <br/>- 3 months - $148.50 (10% off) <br/>- 6 months - $280.50 (15% off) <br/>- 1 year - $528 (20% off) </p>
<p>All rentals due on the 1st of the month. Any new renters will be prorated $1.50/day if they join in the middle of the month to start them on the 1st of the month cycle. </p>
<p><strong>STUDIO BENEFITS</strong></p>
<p>- Use of wheels, slab roller, extruder and facilities<br/>- More than 20 studio hours per week, many on weekends<br/>- Storage space for work and supplies<br/>- Opportunities to exhibit work</p>
<p>Studio hours change monthly based on class schedules. The Clay Studio is open to the public Monday-Friday, 9am-5pm for studio tours, inquiries, and to pick up work. Call the studio at 802.860.7474 for more information.</p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>My Goals</h3>
<div>   This website will only allow me to put $500 dollars for a minimum goal. As you see from the rates above, $528 could get me an entire year of ceramics studio space! This is not my goal. My goal is to rent space until a class is offered. Although it would be great, I just need funding for 3-6 months ($148.50 - $270.50).  If this goal is not reached, I can still use your generous gifts towards rent for the studio space. If this goal is reached or fulfilled beyond $500, the extra donations will be used towards the class that I am saving up for or more studio rent in the future. Having studio time before my next class will help me hone my skills and with your help, I can save my money over the next few months to save for the next class (costing &gt;$200). Every bit helps! </div>

<p>Local, national and international artists work in dance studios, cabins on the land, and in loft spaces,  kitchens, attics and the great outdoors. They create installations, film, audience interactive work, dance, theater, music and genre-busting contemporary performance.</p>
<h3><strong>Your contribution will go to support this year's Artists-in-Residence in the form of need based scholarships.</strong></h3>
<p>We've organized this campaign as a way to raise money for those artists who cannot afford the fee that covers their room and board for the residency.  By contributing to the campaign you're ensuring that E|MERGE remains accessible to fabulous artists regaurdless of their ability to pay.  In addition to this, if we raise enough money we will be able to start an E|MERGE Fund, that will go to support the longevity of this incredible interdisciplinary residency.</p>
<p><strong>E|MERGE is the only artist residency program of its kind in the country!</strong></p>
<p>E|MERGE a unique residency, has been growing since its founding in 2012, into a national and international network of highly skilled artists who continue to support and develop one another’s work, beyond the residency itself.</p>
<p>The residency lasts two full weeks, to give the artists focused project work time. The residency time-line is incredibly intensive. This year, we will focus specific attention on the art of collaboration. Initial workshops and round table discussions will engage various strategies, structures, and techniques of collaboration. </p>
<p>Resident artists receive staff support, housing, food, unlimited studio time, workshops, and a performance production.  An artist fee covers food expenses for the artists, but the residency is otherwise subsidized by Earthdance and reliant on funders and your support! Artist fees do not cover staff, housing, space usage and other expenses.</p>
<p><strong>That's where you come in....Help us to sustain this project.  Make a pledge today!</strong></p>
<p>While <strong>E|MERGE</strong> has been an incredible success for the artists in supporting the vibrant mission and environment that <strong>Earthdance</strong> provides, Earthdance does not currently have funding for this program.  <strong>We remain committed to subsidizing this residency for artists,</strong> who already have the expenses of travel and time without income for 14 days. We are committed to providing this crucial time and space to hard-working artists and building a fund to support the residency into the coming years.</p>

<p><em>Thank you [E|MERGE] for reminding me what it means to create from a place of joy and laughter rather than stress and frustration.  </em></p>
<p>— <strong>Gillian Chadsey</strong>, actor/performer (New York)</p>
<p><em>The two weeks were very inspiring. Fascinating encounters happened within the projects and workshops, but also around them in various informal exchanges - and I do not mean only with each individual, but also in relation to the kind of collective that arised from our gathering at earthdance.</em></p>

<p><em>This residency is a wonderful dream, just keep it going...     </em>           </p>
<p>— <strong>Pamela Casper</strong>, sculptor (New York)</p>
<p><em>E|MERGE is one of the most innovative arts residencies imaginable. It is incredible to have at one's disposal, a group of exquisitely talented interdisciplinary artists who not only have skills, but also have concentrated space and time to work together. The collaborations that result are unique and surprisingly unpredictable... As an artist the Emerge residency gave me both the resources and the time to create what would not have been possible to create elsewhere. The place became as much a part of the content of what was created as the content of the piece itself.</em></p>
<p><em>— </em><strong>Kristen Greco</strong>, choreographer (San Francisco)</p>
<p><em>Artists are meant to learn from each other, and to defy the hierarchical relationships that have perpetuated mentor/student dysfunction, internalized oppression, isolation, etc. E|MERGE presented a model for interrogating those relationships, breaking them apart, and re-forming them in new ways.</em></p>

<p>Thank you for your interest in INSTALL:WeHo. We hope you will take a few minutes to look over the video and read the information below. INSTALL:WeHo is the beginning of a new arts initiative that centers around the support and growth of young, emerging artists and performers in the LGBTQ community. By supporting INSTALL, you are empowering a vital group of people to share their voice and their vision. Thank you again for your interest and care in taking the time to visit us!</p>
<h3>MISSION</h3>
<p>INSTALL:WeHo is an interactive exhibition showcasing the curated and juried work of LBGTQ-minded artists in the Greater Los Angeles community. With the support of the City of West Hollywood, ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives, Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions and Pasadena Arts Council, this pop-up installation will serve as a forum to bring both established and emerging LGBTQ artists and contributors together. In the raw, spontaneous spirit of the underground art scene and with the refined organization of a fine art biennial, INSTALL:WeHo will appear overnight in a caravan of U-­Haul trucks. Each dedicated to, and curated by an individual, organization, gallery or performance troupe, but together forming a pop-­up art ""city."" In doing so, INSTALL:WeHo has the opportunity to share the story, struggles and spirits of our community at large through a diverse array of mediums and forms.</p>
<h3>HOW YOU CAN HELP</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>INSTALL is now trying to raise funds for our inaugural event. This money will go towards grants for the artists we will jury to show on September 16. The ongoing mission of INSTALL:WeHo is to provide a platform and voice for the emerging LGBTQ artists that might not have otherwise had the chace to show their work on a larger level. </p>
<p>While INSTALL:WeHo is a one-day event, the larger goal of the organization is to create an ongoing fund for artists. We hope to become a non-profit that can continually partner with artists and organizations who share our common interest in supporting the art and LGBTQ community. INSTALL will become an annual event as well - offering a fresh look every year at the artists and performers who shape our community today and in the future.</p>
<h3><strong>WHY</strong></h3>
<div>
<p>Today, the LGBTQ Civil Rights movement is moving at an increasing pace. At a time where social/political/historical change is happening rapidly within the LGBTQ community, it is imperative to give our artists a voice. Artists and performers offer a social and emotional context and interpretation for the events taking place around us. It is our hope that by providing grants and showing the works of these voices, we will not only support growth within art community, but we will contribute to the historic documentation of what's to come.</p>

<div>My house has come a looong ways since I began this fundraising campaign and thank you all for your support in helping me make that happen. And, it still has a loong ways to go! Please <i><b>click on the updates tab above</b></i> to see pictures of where I am at now with my build. In the first round of fundraising I raised around $10,000 if I include the offline donations I received. That was a super helpful boost to get this project started. And through continuing to work helping other people build their own dream houses and setting money aside I still have almost $8,000 in my ""tiny house"" savings account. But as of late September, 2015 I have decided to take a leave from my work to focus full time on my house, hopefully until it is done. But to do this means that I will need continued financial support and so I am doing a second round of fundraising. So here we go! Will you help me complete this labor of love and make it the masterpiece that I know it can be? </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>So far I have spent about $12,000 on the house and lived on a very tight budget of just under $1000 a month for my own personal needs. I expect that the whole project will cost around $25,000 when it is said and done, plus hundreds and hundreds of hours in free labor of my and family and friends. It is an art project, exploring the ideas of physical space, community, and shelter... and I am the artist. If you can see the value of this project as community art I hope you will consider funding me to complete this project. Thank you!</div>

<p>Hello! My name is Miwa and I am a young, aspiring female builder. My journey into the building world began four years ago when I first dreamed of building my own home. After working on a bunch of natural building projects, doing a timber frame apprenticeship at <a href=""http://www.heartwoodschool.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Heartwood School</a>, and learning about more conventional construction on the job, I am finally embarking on building my own Tiny Home. I am excited for the opportunity to build my own sacred space and to integrate all that I have learned in the last four years.<b> </b>I want to create a beautiful, affordable, and environmentally friendly home and then be able to share all that I have learned with others!</p>
<p>I see building this home as literally and metaphorically building a solid foundation for myself. I am learning a ton and know that all this knowledge will allow me to better serve others later. Beyond just being my home, I hope this tiny home will  show people what is possible and inspire them to go for their dreams. So please consider helping me with this labor of love so I can get on to the more important business of helping others manifest their dreams!  My goal is to have my home ready to move into by January 2016. To do this I need your help! </p> </div> <div> <h3>Help me build a home that SHINES with community LOVE</h3> <p>These tiny homes tend to cost most people $20,000 - $30,000 in materials to build. That is more money than I have ever had in the bank! I hope to build mine for less, but I do not want to sacrifice quality to do that. I have already put $5000 into this home and and have only $3000 left in savings. My plan is to continue working, paying for things as I go, but your donations will help provide the financial buffer for me to really<b> </b>put my time, energy and <i>Love</i> into this house. </p>
<p><b>In particular, you will help insure that I can continue to choose environmentally friendly, non toxic, local, and salvaged materials whenever possible, and be able to add the creative and artistic touches that will make this home SHINE with community LOVE. </b></p>

<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Other specific things your money will help make possible: </p>
<div><ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The setting up of a solar power system bought from the <a href=""http://ecovillageithaca.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ecovillage @ Ithaca</a> that will allow me to <b>power this build using solar power! </b></span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">The use of <b>rockwool </b>(brand name <a href=""http://www.roxul.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Roxul</a>) as a natural mineral fiber insulation </span></li>
<li>Buying of materials from <b>local small businesses</b>, such as <a href=""http://www.cayugalumber.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cayuga lumber</a>, Collins Lumber Mill, and Locke Enterprises.</li>
<li>Help cover the costs of taking a <b>cabinet making course</b> at the <a href=""http://www.heartwoodschool.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Heartwood School</a>, which I hope will give me the skills to tackle much of the interior finish work on my tiny house </li>
<li><span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;"">As part of choosing to live simply and with a small environmental footprint I do not own a car. And finding creative ways to get around, including biking, walking, and carpooling is something I usually love doing. But occasionally as a builder I do need to rent or borrow a truck or other vehicles. Help me cover these <b>transportation costs</b> and compensate my friends for the use of their cars.</span></li>
</ul></div>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>I already feel the groundswell of enthusiasm and support around ""Tiny Houses"" and their potential to inspire and free people to live their dreams. When I decided to go forth with this project my friend Amy decided she wanted one too. So we actually bought our trailers together, and the planning for her house is already in the works! </div>
<div>At<span style=""font-size: 16px; background-color: initial;""> the core of this dream for me is a belief that the creation of a safe, stable, and sacred space that is ""home"" is a powerful metaphor for many, including myself. Through the outward, physical manifestation of such a space, much inner healing can happen. That is a gift I want to share with others. </span>
</div>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The process has already begun. I am committed to building my home, one way or another. Now it is a question of whether or not I will have to cut corners and sacrifice quality or artistic elements in order to complete my home. Your donations will also help determine whether or not I will be able to pour most of my energy into this, as I want to, or if I will have to split my time working other jobs to allow me to keep moving forward. A financial buffer will make the whole process more enjoyable. For example, it will give me the funds to treat myself and others to a nice hot meal at the end of a hard day's work! </p>
<p>Will you help me manifest this dream to its fullest potential?</p>
<ul></ul>

<div><br/></div>
<div>My stated goal is $7,000 and I hope you will help me reach it, as indiegogo takes an additional 5% penalty for not reaching your goal. My super goal, which I think would allow me to truly relax and sink into my artistic process with this project, is $12,000. If I reach this goal through on and offline donations I will be ecstatic! </div>

</h3> <p>If you can't contribute money there are many other ways you can get involved. Here are just a few ideas:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Come and help out for a day</b>! Or two or three.... Or just come out to say hi. I like getting visitors and it is a great opportunity for you to learn. And it is often a huge help for me just to have the extra hands.</li>
<li>
<b>Donate materials</b>. For now I am looking mostly for raw building materials, like lumber, screws and nails, and a few small windows. I am also on the look out for a small wood stove, an efficient medium sized fridge, a farm style sink for the kitchen and a cute little sink for the bathroom, among other things. If you have something you think I could use let me know!</li>
<li>
<b>Offer your vehicle for the occasional or more long term loan</b>! Having friends with trucks is always handy. I don't own a car at all and am hoping to be able to do this tiny house project without having to buy one, which is proving to be trickier as the weather gets colder. If you are going on vacation or have a second car you rarely use that you would consider loaning or renting to me at a low cost for some or all of the winter, please let me know!<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  </span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Offer your skills</b>! Do you have some special craftsmanship skills that you feel moved to offer? I want this house to shine with community love, which means lots of special artistic touches left by the many hands that will be involved. Consider it an opportunity to get your art out into the world and help beautify a home that I hope many people will pass through.</li>
<li>Help <b>spread the word</b> by sharing this campaign via facebook, twitter, e-mail, and, of course, word of mouth! </li>
</ul>
<div>And last, but certainly not least, I cannot do this without the support of my community, and such support can come in many forms. Just your <b>shared enthusiasm</b> for this project means A LOT to me! (Especially on those days when it is cold and wet and I am having trouble finding my own enthusiasm.) So if this project excites you please let me know! Friend me on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/miwa.robbins"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook</a> to get picture updates and/or consider following my <a href=""http://sculptingearth.wordpress.com/category/the-built-environment/tiny-house/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a> to get a more in depth, if less frequent account of my journey. Blessings to you all and may we all be able to make our dreams come true. </div>

The setting up of a solar power system bought from the Ecovillage @ Ithaca that will allow me to power this build using solar power! 

The use of rockwool (brand name Roxul) as a natural mineral fiber insulation 
Buying of materials from local small businesses, such as Cayuga lumber, Collins Lumber Mill, and Locke Enterprises.
Help cover the costs of taking a cabinet making course at the Heartwood School, which I hope will give me the skills to tackle much of the interior finish work on my tiny house 
As part of choosing to live simply and with a small environmental footprint I do not own a car. And finding creative ways to get around, including biking, walking, and carpooling is something I usually love doing. But occasionally as a builder I do need to rent or borrow a truck or other vehicles. Help me cover these transportation costs and compensate my friends for the use of their cars.


  The Impact
I already feel the groundswell of enthusiasm and support around ""Tiny Houses"" and their potential to inspire and free people to live their dreams. When I decided to go forth with this project my friend Amy decided she wanted one too. So we actually bought our trailers together, and the planning for her house is already in the works! 
At the core of this dream for me is a belief that the creation of a safe, stable, and sacred space that is ""home"" is a powerful metaphor for many, including myself. Through the outward, physical manifestation of such a space, much inner healing can happen. That is a gift I want to share with others. 


  Risks & Challenges The process has already begun. I am committed to building my home, one way or another. Now it is a question of whether or not I will have to cut corners and sacrifice quality or artistic elements in order to complete my home. Your donations will also help determine whether or not I will be able to pour most of my energy into this, as I want to, or if I will have to split my time working other jobs to allow me to keep moving forward. A financial buffer will make the whole process more enjoyable. For example, it will give me the funds to treat myself and others to a nice hot meal at the end of a hard day's work! 
Will you help me manifest this dream to its fullest potential?

  How to Donate
SImply click on the Donate button up above on the right to give money using PayPal or a credit card. Or, if you prefer you can send a check directly to me. Just send me an e-mail to get my mailing address: miwarobbins@gmail.com

My stated goal is $7,000 and I hope you will help me reach it, as indiegogo takes an additional 5% penalty for not reaching your goal. My super goal, which I think would allow me to truly relax and sink into my artistic process with this project, is $12,000. If I reach this goal through on and offline donations I will be ecstatic! 


Other Ways You Can Help
 If you can't contribute money there are many other ways you can get involved. Here are just a few ideas:



Come and help out for a day! Or two or three.... Or just come out to say hi. I like getting visitors and it is a great opportunity for you to learn. And it is often a huge help for me just to have the extra hands.

Donate materials. For now I am looking mostly for raw building materials, like lumber, screws and nails, and a few small windows. I am also on the look out for a small wood stove, an efficient medium sized fridge, a farm style sink for the kitchen and a cute little sink for the bathroom, among other things. If you have something you think I could use let me know!

Offer your vehicle for the occasional or more long term loan! Having friends with trucks is always handy. I don't own a car at all and am hoping to be able to do this tiny house project without having to buy one, which is proving to be trickier as the weather gets colder. If you are going on vacation or have a second car you rarely use that you would consider loaning or renting to me at a low cost for some or all of the winter, please let me know!  


Offer your skills! Do you have some special craftsmanship skills that you feel moved to offer? I want this house to shine with community love, which means lots of special artistic touches left by the many hands that will be involved. Consider it an opportunity to get your art out into the world and help beautify a home that I hope many people will pass through.
Help spread the word by sharing this campaign via facebook, twitter, e-mail, and, of course, word of mouth! 

And last, but certainly not least, I cannot do this without the support of my community, and such support can come in many forms. Just your shared enthusiasm for this project means A LOT to me! (Especially on those days when it is cold and wet and I am having trouble finding my own enthusiasm.) So if this project excites you please let me know! Friend me on facebook to get picture updates and/or consider following my blog to get a more in depth, if less frequent account of my journey. Blessings to you all and may we all be able to make our dreams come true.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","You can still contribute to
Damascus Walls. The money I raise that exceeds the goal will go
directly into donation.
About Me:
My
name is Dima Karout, I live in Montreal and recently the simple question “where
do you come from?” became too complicated to answer.
I
was born in Damascus. At the age of 23, I left home to discover the world. In
my baggage, a Diploma in Visual Communication from the Fine Arts University of
Damascus, Masters Degree in Contemporary Arts and New Media from Paris VIII
University and a Certificate in Creative Writing from Concordia University. 
I
studied and worked in Damascus, Paris and Montreal. I have experience in
graphic design, communication, art research and teaching. I am impressed by
creativity and its limitless nature, I love art, photography and writing, and I
live out of a suitcase.
 
About My Project:
Damascus
Walls is an art expression born under attack. Inspired by a novel in progress, this
exhibition combines photography, creative writing and installation artwork to explore
the metaphor of Walls as barriers surrounding our life.
The Damascus Walls exhibition is divided into three
parts; first two parts explore two fictional characters who are travelling,
looking for answers and struggling with their walls, and the third part is an
installation that combines true stories and images coming from Syrians facing
the conflict in their country:


She – who left before
the conflict





He – who left
during the conflict



We – who are
spread across the planet



 


With Damascus Walls - triggered by my own sense of displacement, I aim
to express the human side of the crisis in Syria, one that often gets lost in the
ongoing reporting of events. By giving a voice to those who have suffered, I
wish to raise awareness and to create a place of sharing. As this project
grows, I want to continue working on it and keep creating “in the hope of lighter baggage”.



 




About Your Contribution:



Your
contribution will help me achieve a project I believe in and have worked on for
three years and present my first solo exhibition in Montreal. It will help me
voice Syrian stories and share with the world our feelings and experiences as
human beings struggling to face the big Wall introduced in our life in 2011.



I
started to organize the Damascus Walls exhibition and I am almost there. The
MAI – Montréal, arts interculturels is hosting the show, and the opening will
be on December 10, 2014.



I
will cover half of the production costs, and I hope you can support me to cover
the other half. Your money will help me with: frames, printing and installation
materials (wires, fabrics, glass).



During
the exhibition, I will put all my artwork for sale, and when the exhibition is
over, I will donate all profits to a Syrian association that operates in the
city of Homs – Almoukales Center. 



And
if this campaign exceeds its goal, I will donate the extra money too.



 


About You:



By being part of this project, you are
empowering art over war in a complicated situation.

My endless gratitude.
-      
Your name will be on the Thank
You Wall during the seven-day show. A photo of this Wall will be on The Walls

Montreal in 2015, your coffee experience is on me. I know the top five coffee
shops.

You can have a 30 minutes Skype call with me, and then I will write a short story about you inspired by our conversation.
-

Graphic Design or Photo Retouching and you are coming to Montreal in 2015, I
can teach you a 5-hour class on either Photoshop or Illustrator. I am “an awesome
and fun teacher” by one of my students. And your coffee is on me.
You
can also purchase one of the printed perks with a photo of Old Damascus, the
oldest inhabited capital in the world, and have it in your home or offer it to a
friend. This piece will remind you that you made a difference.
All
the printed perks are designed and produced by me. They assemble photos of Old
Damascus (textures and details) and creative handwritten pieces (paragraphs
from my stories).
-

Damascus + creative handwritten pieces available in three languages: English,
French and Arabic).

their personal notion of familiarity or intimacy, their “HOME,” in public
spaces around the island. How authentic can we really be outside our familiar
space, our home? How open are we to let the public space become an extension of
our sense of “Home” and take a different meaning in our daily stories?</p>

                                              Historical Center of Ermoupoli
                    3D installation & video projection on neoclassical buildings

     Home is love, Home is where our story begins, Home is
where your heart is!Greece experiences a major crisis, however culture does not pause. The team of Eye's Walk Digital Festival 2015 - ""HOME""* tirelessly prepares with dedication to highlight the beauty of the island of Syros, to bring the neoclassical buildings to life and do something magical using digital art over the canvas of public space.But we do need all the support we can get, and we need your help to complete this project. A small financial contribution would make a huge difference, and that's why we invite you to be part of our effort and part of the ""Eye's Walk Digital Festival 2015"" experience.
Thank you very much!*=Home is love, Home is everywhere.

But, Why Support Eye's Walk Digital Festival?Becasuse Eye’s Walk Festival was a phenomenon, a surprise of
2014!
With a minimal budget, we managed to become the one
innovative festival in Greece and the Balkans that connect video art, painting,
cinema, architecture and experience design. All of that taking place in the cultural
capital of Cyclades, in the Aegean Sea.

Why
is Eye's Walk digital festival 2015 / HOME held in Ermoupoli?
Because Ermoupoli (Hermoupolis) - the capital of Syros
island - provides the perfect space to accommodate a dreamy set-up.
The light, movement and colors of video installation
art on old, historical buildings of the city trigger the senses unexpectedly
and truly awaken the spectator!
Ermoupoli is “home” for so many people from various
backgrounds (religious, social, national). Its buildings have their own stories
to tell for decades now.
Eye’s Walk Digital Festival connects the unique
architectural legacy of Syros with public space and the community of the
island, through the most modern art, video installation art.The
inspiration behind this year’s Eye’s Walk Digital festival is “Home”.
· 
July 25, 21:30
Nine [9] international artists are inspired and create 3d video installations
& projection mapping that will be projected on exterior walls of neoclassic
buildings of Ermoupoli.
Our artists:
Aliki Arnaouti, Angelina Voskopoulos, Οlga Βrouma and Ayis Kelpekis from Greece,
Vladimir Necakov from Serbia, Sophie Leddick from the USA, Katy Kavanaugh from
Germany and Arjang Omrani from Iran.
Public space in Ermoupoli will come alive,
and people that find themselves in the city at the night of July 25th
will walk from each stop of our festival to the next one, interact with the
buildings, learn about their stories, access their secrets and immerse
themselves in the experience we have designed for them.

1st Stop: Apollon Theatre
2nd Stop: Lyceum of Greek Women
3rd Stop: Catholic Nursing Home
,Square Tsiropina
4th Stop:  Androulla Hall, Protopapadaki Street
So let’s make this happen together, because Home is
Everywhere!
· 
July 25-29
""Velissaropoulos Mansion*"" opens its doors for the first time ever and welcomes the contemporary art installation ""Home?
Sweet littlest home"". Created by the ""En Dynamei"" team, this
project was first introduced at the
Macedonian Museum of Contemporary Art, in Thessaloniki [2/2015].
* Velissaropoulos Mansion, a listed
three stories neoclassical building, was built in the nineteenth century,
during the prime of neoclassicism in Greece. It is renowned for its unique
ceiling and wall murals.

Why
is home the title and theme of our festival this year?
What
“HOME” means to us.
“Home”
maybe be our own skin, but it may also be a favorite person; the country we
live in or the country we left behind. “Home” is the ugly duckling turning into
a swan. It is the cozy feeling of morning coffee.
“Home” – “When you focus with your soul’s eyes, you will see home in
many places.”The participating artists explore the meaning of
“Home” through their video installation art.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVAnAQrrtpg&feature=youtu.be  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9zlGbQFRxU&feature=youtu.beThe Eye’s Walk Digital Festival team also explores the
meaning of “Home” in Syros.
Through our photographic project “Inside
Out” that we unveil photo by photo on our Facebook page, different people live
their personal notion of familiarity or intimacy, their “HOME,” in public
spaces around the island. How authentic can we really be outside our familiar
space, our home? How open are we to let the public space become an extension of
our sense of “Home” and take a different meaning in our daily stories?

To 2014 ήμασταν το φεστιβάλ φαινόμενο, η έκπληξη!
Με ελάχιστο προϋπολογισμό γινόμαστε Ένα καινοτόμο φεστιβάλ μοναδικό στην Ελλάδα και στα
Βαλκάνια που συνδέει τη Video art, τη ζωγραφική, τον κινηματογράφο, την
αρχιτεκτονική & το design εμπειρίας στο ιστορικό κέντρο της Ερμούπολης, στη
μέση των Κυκλάδων.Γιατί το Eye΄s
Walk digital  festival 2015, “HOME”
διεξάγεται  στην Ερμούπολη;

Γιατί  η Ερμούπολη
αποτελεί τον ιδανικό χώρο ενός ονειρικού σκηνικού σε χρόνο παρόν! Με την
video installation art  [φως, χρώμα,
κίνηση] παλαιά, ιστορικά κτίρια γοητεύουν αναπάντεχα τις αισθήσεις του θεατή
και ξυπνάνε το βλέμμα μας! Η Ερμούπολη είναι το «σπίτι» για πάρα πολλούς
ανθρώπους  από διαφορετικά μέρη,
θρησκείες, κοινωνικά υπόβαθρα. Τα κτήριά της λένε ιστορίες εδώ και δεκάδες
χρόνια. To “Eye’s Walk digital festival” συνδέει τη μοναδική
αρχιτεκτονική κληρονομιά της Σύρου, το δημόσιο χώρο και την κοινότητα του
νησιού  με την πιο σύγχρονη τέχνη, τη
video installation art. Καλλιτέχνες από όλο τον κόσμο παρουσιάζουν  έργα τους.
H έμπνευση του φετινού Eye’s Walk Digital festival:
“Home”. 
· 
25 Ιουλίου, 21:30
 Εννέα [9] διεθνείς καλλιτέχνες  εμπνέονται από το “HOME”  & δημιουργούν  3d video installations

[Ελλάδα], Άγης Κελπέκης [Ελλάδα].
Και ο δημόσιος χώρος της Ερμούπολης ζωντανεύει καθώς ο κόσμος
ξεκινάει από την 1η Στάση και αλληλεπιδρά με τα παλιά κτήρια,
μαθαίνει τις ιστορίες τους, μπαίνει στα μυστικά τους γίνεται ο ίδιος μέρος του
video installation art πάνω σε αυτά.

25-29 Ιουλίου
Το «Αρχοντικό
Βελισσαρόπουλου*» ανοίγει για πρώτη φορά τις πόρτες του και υποδέχεται το art
installation «Home?- Το μικρό- μικρό σπίτι» της Ομάδας «Εν Δυνάμει»,  που
παρουσιάστηκε για πρώτη φορά στο Μακεδονικό
Μουσείο Σύγχρονης Τέχνης της Θεσσαλονίκης [2/2015].
*Το
Μέγαρο Βελισσαρόπουλου, τριόροφο νεοκλασσικό, διατηρητέο του 19ου
αι. με  μοναδικές τοιχογραφίες και
οροφογραφίες είναι έργο της περιόδου ακμής του νεοκλασικισμού στην Ελλάδα.

Γιατί
ο τίτλος του φεστιβάλ είναι  “HOME” ;
Τι
είναι για εμάς “HOME”;
Σπίτι μπορεί είναι το δέρμα μας,
αλλά και ένας αγαπημένος άνθρωπος, Σπίτι είναι η πατρίδα που έχουμε  και αυτή που αφήνουμε, Σπίτι είναι το
ασχημόπαπο που γίνεται κύκνος, Σπίτι είναι η οικειότητα του πρωϊνού καφέ, Σπίτι
είναι…
“Home” – “When you focus with your soul’s eyes, you will see home in
many places.”Οι
καλλιτέχνες που συμμετέχουν διερευνούν μέσω του video installation art την
έννοια  “HOME”...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVAnAQrrtpg&feature=youtu.behttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9zlGbQFRxU&feature=youtu.be Η ομάδα του Eye’s
Walk digital festival αναζητά και αυτή ταυτόχρονα την έννοια του “HOME” στη
Σύρο το 2015.
Με το
φωτογραφικό project ""Inside Out"" που παρουσιάζεται στη σελίδα μας στο facebook,
διαφορετικοί άνθρωποι της Σύρου ζουν τη δική στους «προσωπική και οικεία»
στιγμή σε εξωτερικούς χώρους του νησιού. Πόσο αυθεντικοί είμαστε έξω από τα
όρια του «οικείου σπιτιού» , πόσο  χώρο
αφήνουμε στο δημόσιο χώρο να αποτελέσει κομμάτι οικείο μας, κομμάτι της
καθημερινής μας ιστορίας;

<h3><b>Short Summary</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Help Get Sal Garcia's Art to NYC by June!</b> Greetings!  I am Sal Garcia, an artist in the San Francisco Bay Area raising funds for a solo gallery exhibition in New York City.  A gallery has offered me a show that will open in late June in SoHo NYC.  I am excited about this opportunity to share my work with a New York audience but the gallery does not pay for shipping.  I spent most of my career doing community based work, so the opportunity to show in a New York gallery is big and wonderful…. but the cost of shipping the work is daunting.  Please support my campaign to get this unique body of work to New York City!</p>
<p><b>What is this about blue jaguars? </b> I am a California artist with strong connections to the San Francisco art community and a history of activism.  Many of my paintings contain images that draw on the Chicano experience, pre-Columbian cosmology, and shamanic visions.  The Jaguar is a shamanic symbol in various cultures, and in pre-Columbian culture blue is the color of the sacred.  I have included blue jaguars and other magical creatures in many of my paintings for the last twenty years.  I want to bring some of these creatures to New York and set them loose!  </p>

<p><b>New works on paper!  </b> I am also very excited to let you know that I will show a number of works on paper including prints and collages in New York. I will share a number of newer abstract collages in New York that are meditations on color and composition. Some people have seen these in the studio but this is the first time that they will be exhibited publicly. I will also show some other new pieces such as ""Rolling the Bones"" a fantastic collage piece full of skeletons, fire, and luck and some screen prints such as ""Three Seeds for Your Birthday"" featuring a poem by San Francisco Poet Laureate Alejandro Murguia.</p>

<p><b>Who Is this Sal Garcia guy? </b> I have been making art since I was a child.   I grew up in the Central Valley of California and was introduced to art at a very young age by people who took an interest.  I was mentored by a number of very early Chicano artists, studied art at the California State University and also had the opportunity to study at the Taller Siquieros, the art school in Mexico founded by the great Mexican muralist.  I have been blessed with some success and my work is in a number of museums and private collections including that of Carlos Santana.</p>

<p>My youth coincided with the Civil Rights Movement and the Chicano Rights Movement and I was very active as a young artist working with art groups that would produce posters, murals, logos, screen prints, banners, and t-shirts for non-profits, marches, and the community at large. I made art to support Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers and logos and posters for many community organizations such as Radio Bilingue which today operates across the Southwestern United States.  I worked on staff at Galeria de la Raza, a premier community art gallery in San Francisco's Mission District for nine years.  </p>

<p></p>
<p>My work has been inextricably linked to my community and my experience but I do not feel that it should be in any ""box"": my vision is global and my art is transcendental. My painting, works on paper, sculpture, and even my wearable art, such as my amulets, come from a place whose inspiration is universal.  They contain color, light, and movement and have a special energy. I hope you can see some of that in the images I have loaded onto this site. </p>

<p>Art is meant to communicate, to inspire, to be seen. Art is not useful packed away in a studio.  I have shown my work across California and have participated in national and international group exhibitions.  I have had solo exhibitions in California where thousands of people have been able to see large numbers of my pieces together.  However, this would be my first opportunity to have a solo show in New York City.  Please help make it happen!</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>
<b>My Indiegogo campaign will make this art show happen!  </b>The gallery where I will be showing does not cover shipping and framing of the art work … and unfortunately shipping and framing art is quite costly.  This Indiegogo campaign will allow the show to go forward by providing the funds to actually move the art from the San Francisco Bay Area to New York and back.  It will also cover the framing of from 12-20 of the new works on paper.  Finally, it will cover my travel costs so that I can support the installation of the show and attend the opening celebration. We have received bids from a number of art shipping companies that will professionally wrap and move the work from the San Francisco Bay Area to New York City and back.  We have also scoped out the costs of exhibition framing for the works on paper.  Our budget includes the following rough elements:<p></p>
<p><b>BUDGET</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>$7,800.</b> Packing and shipping the art via a professional art moving company from San Francisco, to New York City, and back  </li>
<li>
<b>$3,200.</b> Framing of up to 20 art works on paper</li>
<li>
<b>$1,500. </b> Ticket to New York and Lodging</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Total budget:  $12,500. </b></p>
<p><b>STRETCH BUDGET</b></p>
<p>If we can raise $12,500, a fairly large show of my work will go forward, but I would be thrilled if we could exceed that. I have a stretch budget in mind which, if we can exceed our goal, would allow me to make some giclee prints of the new collage work on acid free paper that would be available at reasonable prices at the gallery.  </p>
<ul><li><b> $4,000 giclee prints</b></li></ul>
<p><b>TOTAL STRETCH BUDGET BEYOND</b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> GOAL:  $16,500</b></p>
<p><b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If we do not achieve our full budget of $12,500, funds will </span>still go towards the show, but the show will be smaller.  W<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">e will shift gears and send a much smaller amount of work to New York City,  and show fewer of the collages that require framing.  </span></b></p>
<p><b>Join Us!!!  </b> We hope you will join us in bringing this special work to NYC.  We have some great thank you gifts if you can join us. And when we make our Indiegogo goal, we hope you will attend the opening!! </p>
<h3><b>Fantastic Thank You Gifts!!!  Cards, Prints, Spirit Bags, Blue Jaguars!</b></h3>
<p>We have already prepared some wonderful thank you gifts for those of you who are able to join us in bring the blue jaguar(s) to New York City.  We are excited to share these items with our supporters. </p>
<p><b>For donating any amount:</b>  I am grateful!  You receive our sincere thanks and your name on an acknowledgement poster on the gallery wall at the opening of the show.</p>
<p><b>$25 up to $50:</b>  I am touched and thankful!!  You receive three blank greeting cards featuring images of my work with my signature on them.</p>
<p><b>$50 up to $100:  </b>I amazed at your generosity! You receive a pack of three blank greeting cards featuring my work and one signed digital color print of my collage work (there are two to choose from ""Frida"" or ""Our Lady of the Butterflies""). </p>

You receive both of the signed digital color prints of my collage work (""Frida"" and ""Our Lady of the Butterflies"") and a copy of my secret molé recipe so that you can make some magic in your own kitchen! <br/></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary

Help Get Sal Garcia's Art to NYC by June! Greetings!  I am Sal Garcia, an artist in the San Francisco Bay Area raising funds for a solo gallery exhibition in New York City.  A gallery has offered me a show that will open in late June in SoHo NYC.  I am excited about this opportunity to share my work with a New York audience but the gallery does not pay for shipping.  I spent most of my career doing community based work, so the opportunity to show in a New York gallery is big and wonderful…. but the cost of shipping the work is daunting.  Please support my campaign to get this unique body of work to New York City!
What is this about blue jaguars?  I am a California artist with strong connections to the San Francisco art community and a history of activism.  Many of my paintings contain images that draw on the Chicano experience, pre-Columbian cosmology, and shamanic visions.  The Jaguar is a shamanic symbol in various cultures, and in pre-Columbian culture blue is the color of the sacred.  I have included blue jaguars and other magical creatures in many of my paintings for the last twenty years.  I want to bring some of these creatures to New York and set them loose!

New works on paper!   I am also very excited to let you know that I will show a number of works on paper including prints and collages in New York. I will share a number of newer abstract collages in New York that are meditations on color and composition. Some people have seen these in the studio but this is the first time that they will be exhibited publicly. I will also show some other new pieces such as ""Rolling the Bones"" a fantastic collage piece full of skeletons, fire, and luck and some screen prints such as ""Three Seeds for Your Birthday"" featuring a poem by San Francisco Poet Laureate Alejandro Murguia.

Who Is this Sal Garcia guy?  I have been making art since I was a child.   I grew up in the Central Valley of California and was introduced to art at a very young age by people who took an interest.  I was mentored by a number of very early Chicano artists, studied art at the California State University and also had the opportunity to study at the Taller Siquieros, the art school in Mexico founded by the great Mexican muralist.  I have been blessed with some success and my work is in a number of museums and private collections including that of Carlos Santana.

My youth coincided with the Civil Rights Movement and the Chicano Rights Movement and I was very active as a young artist working with art groups that would produce posters, murals, logos, screen prints, banners, and t-shirts for non-profits, marches, and the community at large. I made art to support Cesar Chavez's United Farm Workers and logos and posters for many community organizations such as Radio Bilingue which today operates across the Southwestern United States.  I worked on staff at Galeria de la Raza, a premier community art gallery in San Francisco's Mission District for nine years.  

Preparing the Sal Garcia Dia de los Muertos Installation for the Oakland Museum

My work has been inextricably linked to my community and my experience but I do not feel that it should be in any ""box"": my vision is global and my art is transcendental. My painting, works on paper, sculpture, and even my wearable art, such as my amulets, come from a place whose inspiration is universal.  They contain color, light, and movement and have a special energy. I hope you can see some of that in the images I have loaded onto this site. 

 
Art is meant to communicate, to inspire, to be seen. Art is not useful packed away in a studio.  I have shown my work across California and have participated in national and international group exhibitions.  I have had solo exhibitions in California where thousands of people have been able to see large numbers of my pieces together.  However, this would be my first opportunity to have a solo show in New York City.  Please help make it happen!


What We Need & What You Get
My Indiegogo campaign will make this art show happen!  The gallery where I will be showing does not cover shipping and framing of the art work … and unfortunately shipping and framing art is quite costly.  This Indiegogo campaign will allow the show to go forward by providing the funds to actually move the art from the San Francisco Bay Area to New York and back.  It will also cover the framing of from 12-20 of the new works on paper.  Finally, it will cover my travel costs so that I can support the installation of the show and attend the opening celebration. We have received bids from a number of art shipping companies that will professionally wrap and move the work from the San Francisco Bay Area to New York City and back.  We have also scoped out the costs of exhibition framing for the works on paper.  Our budget includes the following rough elements:
BUDGET


$7,800. Packing and shipping the art via a professional art moving company from San Francisco, to New York City, and back  

$3,200. Framing of up to 20 art works on paper

$1,500.  Ticket to New York and Lodging

Total budget:  $12,500. 
STRETCH BUDGET
If we can raise $12,500, a fairly large show of my work will go forward, but I would be thrilled if we could exceed that. I have a stretch budget in mind which, if we can exceed our goal, would allow me to make some giclee prints of the new collage work on acid free paper that would be available at reasonable prices at the gallery.  
 $4,000 giclee prints
TOTAL STRETCH BUDGET BEYOND GOAL:  $16,500
If we do not achieve our full budget of $12,500, funds will still go towards the show, but the show will be smaller.  We will shift gears and send a much smaller amount of work to New York City,  and show fewer of the collages that require framing.  
Join Us!!!   We hope you will join us in bringing this special work to NYC.  We have some great thank you gifts if you can join us. And when we make our Indiegogo goal, we hope you will attend the opening!! 
Fantastic Thank You Gifts!!!  Cards, Prints, Spirit Bags, Blue Jaguars!
We have already prepared some wonderful thank you gifts for those of you who are able to join us in bring the blue jaguar(s) to New York City.  We are excited to share these items with our supporters. 
For donating any amount:  I am grateful!  You receive our sincere thanks and your name on an acknowledgement poster on the gallery wall at the opening of the show.
$25 up to $50:  I am touched and thankful!!  You receive three blank greeting cards featuring images of my work with my signature on them.
$50 up to $100:  I amazed at your generosity! You receive a pack of three blank greeting cards featuring my work and one signed digital color print of my collage work (there are two to choose from ""Frida"" or ""Our Lady of the Butterflies""). 
$100 up to $250:  I am so thankful that I want to give you something delicious! You receive both of the signed digital color prints of my collage work (""Frida"" and ""Our Lady of the Butterflies"") and a copy of my secret molé recipe so that you can make some magic in your own kitchen! 
$250 up to $450: That is so wonderful!  You will receive a pack of a dozen blank greeting cards featuring my work, two signed digital color prints of my collage work (""Frida"" and ""Our Lady of the Butterflies"") and a copy of my secret molé recipe so that you can make some magic in your own kitchen while writing out cards to your best friends telling them about the show!

 Digital Print ""Our Lady of the Butterflies""

$450 up to $1,000: My gratitude is overflowing.  You will receive a limited edition 13 color silk screen print entitled “Jaguar with 2 Dragons"".  This from an edition of 100 and printed on italian paper. This is a fantastic print suitable for a special place in your home.  A blue jaguar holds a heart that radiates power while the feathered serpents or 'dragons' encircle it and flames and incantations pour forth.  You will love this!

<p>In 2013 we had a vision: to create a handmade, homegrown lantern festival, and to convince the rest of Prince Edward County they should join us! Guess what? We’ve succeeded in creating a truly beautiful community festival in which everyone can – and does - participate. The Firelight Lantern Festival has doubled in size every year; in the last 3 years we have taught 900 people how to make their own handmade paper lanterns, and we’ve been dazzled by the enthusiastic crowds who have come together to parade through the streets and dance the night away.</p>
<p><strong>Meet your festival co-directors: </strong></p>
<p>Krista Dalby is a playwright, director and producer; recent productions include 'The Tale of a Town: Prince Edward County', 'Unjustly', 'The Monster of Lake on the Mountain', and 'The History of Shadows'. She is the co-director of the Firelight Lantern Festival and Board Member of the Prince Edward County Arts Council. Her pride and joy is Small Pond Arts, an art farm that hosts artists in residence, her husband Milé Murtanovski’s art gallery, and many joyous creative events, including the annual Scarecrow Festival.</p>
<p>Susanne Larner is a Prince Edward County native who draws inspiration for her paintings and creative projects from her idyllic surroundings. Growing up rurally, her creative family gave her the encouragement to study visual art in Toronto and Vancouver where she discovered a love of mixed media and the playfulness of craft. Returning to her rural roots, Susanne brought with her a passion for creative event-building, art education and fusing fine art with craft. She is co-director of the Firelight Lantern Festival, a founding member of the Picton Comix Jam, a participant in local art shows, and a volunteer artist with Puppets Without Borders.</p>
<p><strong>What we’ve got up our sleeve</strong></p>
<p>Starting in October 2016, we'll be touring the County with our mobile lantern-making workshops, and working hard to create a stunning festival on November 12. Join us for our lantern parade, music from the fabulous Dave Clark &amp; the Woodshed Orchestra, a special performance from Electric Hoopster, and lots of surprises created just for you! As always, we offer our workshops and admission to our festival at a very minimal cost in order to remain accessible to all.</p>
<p><strong>Why we need your help</strong></p>
<p>This is our first crowdfunding campaign. In the past we’ve been successful at securing substantial funding from a provincial organization. This year we didn’t receive this grant, simply because it is an extremely competitive program to which only 1 in 3 applicants is successful. However, we do have a small amount of funding already in place, and we are determined to create another beautiful, magical festival for our community.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need to raise $7500. We have trimmed expenses wherever we can (artists are really good at pinching pennies!), and this amount represents approximately half of this year’s budget.</p>
<p>We’re thrilled that our community has stepped up with their support, and we're able to offer you so many awesome perks to choose from in exchange for your donation!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>This is the only festival of its kind in Prince Edward County, and we want to keep it going! So many participants have told us how much the festival means to them. Here’s what a few of them had to say:</p>
<p>“We had so much fun participating in your Firelight Lantern Festival! We came to your final workshop at the town hall and instantly loved the atmosphere - no grumpy people do this kind of stuff - just friendly faces of all ages working away, loving all the colours and glue and stuff… We told our friends and neighbours about you two and the workshops and the procession and the goings-on at the Crystal Palace... What a wonderful community event you've created - thank you SO much for all that you give to make it happen. We are truly appreciative beneficiaries of your generosity.”</p>
<p>“It was magical! Your vision inspired our entire community!”</p>
<p>“So GOOD!! Thanks so much, we are beyond grateful.”</p>
<p>“It was magical, spectacular and so lovely!!!”</p>
<p>“Magical, heartfelt, exhilarating and beautifully surreal. Plus I danced my ass off! Thank you for letting us into your imagination.”</p>
<p>“It was great fun participating in the Lantern Parade and Shadow Puppet Production ... thanks to all those Creative Lantern Makers ... what a whimsical evening for little folk and big folk too!!!”</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If you cannot make a financial donation at this time, you can help by sharing our campaign on social media.</p>
<p>You can also contact us if you are interested in volunteering; we have many opportunities available both prior to and during the festival: krista@smallpondarts.ca</p>

<p>Perphone is a fashion and fragrance accessory, designed around the only object that we carry always: our smartphones. Not only is it fashionable, but it also comes to one’s rescue in daily situations.</p>
<p>Perphone is the perfect gadget- it can be paired and matched with whatever you are wearing, can be used by everyone in all situations, and it is ideal whenever a quick refreshment is needed before a business meeting, a date, when traveling, or simply to regain a comfortable feeling. We all need to be continuously refreshed throughout the day, every day.</p>
<p>We aim to replace the old-fashioned, rarely used 2-ml. testers we are given by famous brands with our new containers. They are small, light, and attached to your phone, which ensures that they will always be with you when needed. Moreover, they give a new look to the smartphones, with a large variety of colors and designs. Most people already buy covers and casings to protect and accessorize their smartphones- why not buy one that is practical as well as fashionable?</p>
<h2>The Patent</h2>
<p>We registered a patent in Germany and filed an international application with the Patent Cooperation Treaty (aka PCT) back in 2011 (see below), to protect our idea and its investors, as well as to reserve potential developments of it in other fields of applications that we are yet studying, like self defense with pepper spray, bad breath remedies, etc.</p>
<p><strong>PCT-EP2011-063741 – German Patent Office DEGD-112092.9</strong></p>
<h2>Market</h2>
<p>We have already been testing Perphone with renowned luxury and fashion brands in Milan, Paris, Düsseldorf, etc. We were delighted to witness their initial surprise, pleasure, and interest while trying out the product and going through a brain storming on its potential application fields. One of the most recurring questions was, “How did you guys come up with that?”</p>
<h2>Why you need it…</h2>
<p>The most striking thing about Perphone is its simple necessity. While going about your day, be it at work or university, after a meal, or moving from place to place running errands, don’t you ever feel the need to get refreshed? What if you feel the need to refresh yourself before an important meeting or date, and you don’t have time, or you forgot your perfume or breath freshener? What if you have a small purse, or simply don’t want to carry around a bulky, heavy perfume bottle? What if you are traveling and cannot carry liquids with you? Not only can Perphone refresh you throughout the flight, but you can also carry enough small, light refill containers for the entirety of your trip! And since the liquid is contained in your phone cover, you will always have it with you!</p>
<h2>Project's Current Status and Next Steps:</h2>
<p>We are working extensively on the designs while testing our prototypes. We aim to release 10-ml. containers. Our next step will be developing the PVC (full product) and Carbon Fiber (cases only).</p>
<p>The already- defined prototypes will reach the market this April, if we are able to complete the tooling process and packaging on time.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>What we need the money for?</h2>
<p>Tooling and packaging are the most expensive stages. We need help in building the molds for the product parts and the different packages we have enlisted in our catalogue and on the offered perks options.</p>
<h2>About Us</h2>
<p><em>Maria Del Padre</em> is our Product Manager. She has experience in the fashion industry, and ran a wide ""demand campaign"" from which we received exciting results. She is responsible for market segmentation, and, together with our designer, they are actively looking into a 360 exploitation of our patents.</p>
<p>Our designer, <em>Sergio Mattia</em>, is currently residing in Italy. He has been working with 3D CAD/CAM software for about 20 years, and enjoys playing the guitar. His motto is “if after a good glass of red wine, and a homemade “antipasto” (appetizer), you still think the same, stop thinking (finish your wine) and make it real!”</p>
<p><em>Sergio Milstein</em> is an organized computer freak with a passion for smartphones. His family is comprised of IT folks, with roots in both the former USSR and Italy. He is an extensive shopper in all northern and central Italian outlets. He is creative, innovative, and comes up with brilliant new ideas every day.</p>
<p><em>Kirill Kapranov</em> is a young, talented, Moscow-born PR and Sales Manager that received his secondary education at Munich International School, and has studied at the university-level at Sciences Po Paris in France, as well as in the Middle East. He is an extensive traveler who speaks English, Russian, German, French, and Arabic, and is focusing on our sales pipeline execution.</p>
<p>We would like to thank everyone who has helped us! Our virtual team is quite large, young, experienced, and altogether is fluent in 6 languages (English, Italian, German, French, Russian, Arabic), because we understand the importance of communication, and wish our product to succeed internationally.</p>

Tooling and packaging are the most expensive stages. We need help in building the molds for the product parts and the different packages we have enlisted in our catalogue and on the offered perks options.

<p>The contemporary artist Tatsuo Miyajima internationally renowned for his works adopting the LED digital counters will be producing “Sea of Time in Tohoku” for the repose of souls of victims from the Great East Japan Earthquake. We are calling out for supporters from around the world to lay the foundation for this project that will continue to be produced for 10 years.</p>
<p>Miyajima will be installing his major work with 3000 LED gadgets flashing in a giant pool at a corner of the Oshika Peninsula located in Ishinomaki City, Miyagi facing the Pacific Ocean to ""repose of the victims"" and ""commemorate an unprecedented disaster"" of the Great East Japan Earthquake for posterity.</p>
<p>I knew immediately I had to do something when the Great East Japan Earthquake hit.</p>
<p>First I began on the second day since the earthquake by suggesting TV Asahi to turn off the lights of my work ""Counter Void"" (on the wall of　the TV　Asahi Corporation building) installed as a Public Art at Roppongi Hills, Tokyo. I assume people have once seen the giant wall of light with digital numbers counting from 9 to 1.</p>
<p>On the fourth day post the earthquake, I went to the Tohoku University of Art and Design (Yamagata) where I served as the Vice President at the time, to encourage the students. After this I engaged in activities such as removing mud in Ishinomaki  as a volunteer, and participating in the AAFJ (a fund-raising project supported through selling drawings) hosted by the students and alumnus of the university by drawing pictures myself.</p>

<p>Ishinomaki City (2011)</p>
<p>The ""Counter Void"" in Roppongi has since then been turned off with the purpose of the repose, and after 5 years from the earthquake it had been relighted as the ""Relight Project"" for 3 days beginning from March 11th, 2016 to prevent the fading of memories and to have the young generations who have never seen the work know about the project.</p>

<p>""Counter Void"" (Roppongi Hills, TV Asahi) Taken on March 11th, 2016 for the relighting.</p>
<p>To this day I have held exhibitions in more than 260 sites in 30 countries, with over 70 museums with my works in their collection. But the fundamental idea I have in myself is that above anything, art should be shared for ""people who live the present time"" and moreover ""exists for the people.""</p>
<p>The ""Sea of Time"" with counting LED gadgets spread all over is my debuting work from 1988.</p>
<p>The numbers count from 9 to 1, and without the 0, it starts over counting from 9 to 1. The time being counted represents ""life"" and the time of darkness ""death,"" showing the ""life"" and ""death"" repeating eternally.</p>

<p>I have visited Ishinomaki several times since 2015, walking and interviewing in person: ""What do you think about artists making work here?"" and ""How are victims of the disaster feeling right now?""</p>
<p>As a result this outlined the reality of the people trying to move forward, and at the same time their wish not to be forgotten. And to my surprise I did not encounter any person who detested the ocean that deprived them of everything. This experience reenforced my decision to produce “Sea of Time in Tohoku.”</p>
<p>The concept of “Sea of Time in Tohoku” is to be completed with placing 3000 LED gadgets in a giant pool scaling 30m x 50m. To do so, this project would cost a hundred millions altogether, with which would surpass the supporting fund by the festival and Miyajima's personal funding invested together.<br/>Here we call out for supporters through crowdfunding with the aim of 300 LED lights which is 1/10 of the project as a beginning for this year, and seek to complete the project in 10 years by adding the number of LED lights each year. We would like to broadly collect supporters through this crowdfunding for production as ""Support Artists.""</p>

<p>For the victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake in Tohoku, I will have each person set their timing of the LED lights to have them leave their ""light of life"" to their loved ones.</p>
<p>This means that each LED gadget would be coupled as a pair by the victims of the Great East Japan Earthquake in Tohoku who will set the time of ""life and death,"" and the ""Support Artists"" who have supported through crowdfunding that undertakes the production cost.</p>

One day, I bought a black-and-white tv at the thrift store and plugged it into my first-generation Roku player. Netflix totally worked and I was able to stream ""The Twilight Zone"". So, I tweeted about it and it kind of went viral.

Above: My actual 1975 General Electric model 12XB9104V TVIt's a handsome television so, naturally, I decided to make a lapel pin of my 1975 General Electric model 12XB9104V TV. However, it couldn't be just any old General Electric Model 12XB9104V hard-enamel pin. No, this TV pin GLOWS IN THE DARK!Also, I'm working with Factory Two, (a great maker-space in Flint, Michigan) to print clear vinyl stickers so that the image on the screen can change to one of several different options. The clear stickers stick on top of the glow-in-the-dark enamel to light up the image after it's exposed to light. Right now, I have a small batch of the TV pins ready to go, but I need your help with production costs for the packaging, sticker packs, and shipping supplies. I'd also like to pay for another run of pins and stickers so that they can be available to everyone.What's The Plan?I hope to raise at least $500 to cover the cost of the current batch of TV pins, another run, stick-on screen decals, clever packaging, and shipping supplies. The perks are thus:

</h3>
<p>
</p><p><i>(yes, this is what I wanted to say in my video, but I have far too many nerves while on camera)</i></p><p>Hello everyone! Greetings from Berlin, I hope that everyone is happy and
healthy in the new year! I’m speaking to you through the magic of the internet
because I’m excited to share one of my current projects, titled “The way is not
in the sky.”<span>  This is a solo exhibition
at Mila Kunstgalerie here in Berlin, and it opens on June 20<sup>th</sup>. This
will be my first solo show in Europe, and it’s especially exciting that it’s
taking place in Berlin, where I am working hard to establish myself in the art
scene. If you know my artwork, you know that it’s labor-intensive and
materially expensive. The gallery consists of two rooms, which you can see here
behind me, for which I plan to make installations that consist of floor pieces
made from both contact paper and carpet squares, and video projections on
painted walls – with possible added architectural elements. I am very grateful
for this enormous opportunity, and I want to make the most of it. Which is why
I’m asking you to also become involved and support me and my project, support
my first real entry into the Berlin art scene, and help me establish myself
here while still remaining close to my roots and my wonderful community abroad.
More details about me, my background, my project, and how you can get involved
are available below. I look forward to
working with you and staying in touch about the development of this project and
my new life in Berlin...</span></p>
<br/><p></p><p></p><h3>More Details...<br/>
</h3>So most of you know me, but for those
of you who are meeting me now for the first time, I am an artist (and teacher,
gardener, cat mom) who, after spending eight wonderful years in Minneapolis,
recently relocated to Berlin to follow my dreams to live in Europe. My artistic
practice is site-specific, often taking into account both the architectural
details of the site and its history, and create opportunities for the viewer to
be truly present in the moment and in that space. More about my practice can be
read further below and on my <a href=""http://jenniferdanos.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>. Berlin is an
incredibly exciting place for me to continue my research and to locate my
artwork, as both the history and the architectural landscape here speak to my
interests and intentions.<p></p>
<p>As I briefly mentioned in the video, my
campaign is in support of my first solo exhibition in Berlin at Mila Kunstgalerie,
which opens on June 20<sup>th</sup> of this year. This project is large-scale,
transforming the two rooms of the gallery with floor works and video
projections, therefore requiring a considerable amount of material (including,
but not limited to: contact paper, carpet tiles, paint, and other building
materials) and dedicated studio time, as my work is very slow and precise. The
concepts will be in line with the work I produced last year, revolving around
the relationships between our selves and our environment, the exchanges between
the body and the mind, and the tensions between real and perceived time. Please see samples of my recent floor installations by clicking the ""Gallery"" tab above.<br/></p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because
I want to make the absolute most of this opportunity and use this show to help
establish myself in the Berlin art scene, which will lead to a sustainable life
and studio practice in Berlin. Alone, I do not have the resources to make this
exhibition exactly as I imagine it to be, and conversely, it would be a very
difficult situation if I were not able to live up to the occasion – for myself
and for those who are offering the show, as I am building a reputation through
my artwork and my actions. With a successful
solo show in Berlin, I will be able to gain new exhibition opportunities, forge
new relationships with curators and collectors, and build new contacts for
employment. </p>
<p>I have always been a hard worker,
juggling my artistic practice with teaching and my various other jobs and
activities, while also trying to participate in and support my community.
Continuing this pace in Berlin is a challenge that I take on voluntarily and
gladly, but it is nevertheless proving to be a task that requires me to reach
out to my community to assist me in a moment when the timing and scope of my
artistic opportunities have gone beyond my individual means during this period
of transition. Some of you are familiar with an earlier campaign that I
launched before my artist residency in Bad Ems, which I was thankful to be able
to cancel because of a generous and unexpected last-minute grant. </p>
<p>This is a different time and a
different set of circumstances; even more crucial, I would say, as it truly is
my chance to establish a long-term place for myself and my practice here in
Berlin. It would sincerely mean a lot to me to be able to create this project
with your participation and support, as I do feel that it is because of all of
you - my friends, family, and colleagues - that I have achieved what I have and
am on this incredible path, personally and professionally, in Berlin today.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to raise a minimum of $4000 for this project. Here's a break-down of expenses that
comprise my Goal:</p><p>
</p><p>Materials (contact paper, carpet squares, paint &amp; building
supplies, 2 DVD players, etc) = $2500<span> <br/></span></p><p>
</p><p>Studio Time<span> (to compensate for my inability to work a
second job, especially during installation, as I still have to feed myself and pay bills) = $700<br/></span></p><p>
</p><p>Other expenses (such as public transportation to research
materials &amp; concepts, needing to have something made, etc)  = $400</p><p>
</p><p><span></span>Cost of making &amp;
sending Perks = $400</p><p>
</p><p><i>Expenses after
reaching Goal:</i></p><p>
</p><p>Amount after fees to indiegogo = approx. $3720<br/></p><p>
</p><p>$3720 equals approx. 2723 Euro</p><p>If I
     don’t reach my entire goal, I
will still use the funds towards the project, and will continue to search for
other ways to raise or borrow money.<br/></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><i>What you get: PERKS!</i><br/></p><p>
</p>See the selection of Perks (located on the right) ranging from digital images, to actual pieces of the project in Berlin, to a catalog of my floor pieces produced while at the Balmoral Residency.<br/><br/>Corporate sponsorship is welcome! If your company is interested in supporting my project, I would be happy to mention the sponsorship in press materials and on my website - the more support, the more ways I can advertise your company... I won't get a tattoo with your logo, but I am sure we can work out something reasonable.<br/><p><i> </i><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p>
<p>We all want to see each other succeed –
when one of us is lifted up, we are all lifted up. I also know that you all
feel the importance of the arts in our society, while, as you also know,
support for the arts and for individual artists is in decline. My feeling is
that, when we can, we all want to pay it forward – since we all have moments
when we can give and moments when we need support. Your involvement is not just
in this one exhibition, but it’s part of the larger, ongoing ways that we have been connected personally and professionally.</p>
<p>We all know this will be a success. I
enjoy a good reputation for making the best of opportunities, whether it be an
exhibition or a job, and absolutely took advantage of the amazing fortune I had
last year with the grant and artist residency. The first few months in Berlin
were spent researching, networking, and preparing for my residency in Bad Ems.
While at the residency, I produced new work for five group exhibitions within
six months’ time. Not a moment was wasted. You will see in my portfolio and CV (by clicking the ""Gallery"" tab above)
that my experience supports my ability to carry out this project. As much as I
want to establish myself here in Berlin, and in Europe, it is still important
to me to remain close to my friends, family, and colleagues in the States. I fully believe in this show and my future in
Berlin; I hope that you can feel my enthusiasm and share in the excitement with
me.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p></p>
<p>I realize that funding every project
isn’t possible for all of us,<span>  but there
are other ways that you can support my project, such as helping to spread the
word through private and public platforms – whether it be forwarding my e-mail
to your friends, family and colleagues who might be interested, or promoting my
project on Facebook and other websites that have a wider audience.</span></p>
<p>There are tools to share my project built
into the indiegogo platform, please feel free to use these tools to further

<p style=""text-align: center;"">a new community mural project in Sunset Park, Brooklyn</p>
<p>Sunset
Park is a diverse community comprised largely of immigrants and indigenous
peoples.  We believe in their journey and,
with this mural, strive to convey that the future is a blank canvas with
limitless possibilities. With a focus on the female experience, we will gather
stories from grandmothers, mothers, and their daughters creating a public,
permanent mural that honors their lives, families and the community they are
forging in Sunset Park. </p>
<p>We are
also committed to providing training and opportunities for the young women of
Sunset Park. Classes in mural making will be offered that also develop skills
for community building and leadership. As we move forward into this exciting
future together, <b><u>our team needs your
support</u></b>. No contribution is too small, and we believe that with your
help this project will come to life. Your time, consideration, and contributions
are immensely appreciated.</p>
<p><b><i>ALL DONATIONS
ARE FULLY TAX-DEDUCTIBLE.</i></b></p>
<p>For the
last fourteen years, our lead muralist, Vaimoana Niumeitolu, has served as a
teaching artist for in-school artistic residencies with Ping Chong + Company, a
theatre company that addresses civic and social issues both on stage and in the
community. We are so grateful that Ping Chong + Company has agreed to serve as
our fiscal sponsor and therefore all donations are fully tax-deductible!</p>

<p><b><i>THE BUDGET
BREAKDOWN</i></b></p>
<p>$17,000 -
Secure the lease of an Art Studio for the duration of the year (that’s close to
$50/day). All painting for the mural will take place indoors in our studio on
parachute cloth and will then be transported onto the exterior wall upon
completion. This Art Studio will be our home in Brooklyn. We are looking ahead
and we want to continue to paint murals within Brooklyn communities- this is
just the first!</p>
<p>$25,000 -
Pay four full-time salaries for our primary muralists to plan and complete the
mural in addition to teaching classes to youth in the community from January to
May 2015. <br/>
<br/>
$2,500 - Cover the cost of art supplies, office supplies and equipment. (i.e.
paint, primer, sealer, parachute cloth, brushes, etc.)</p>
<p>$2,000 -
Rent scaffolding required for the final installation of the mural.</p>
<p>$2,500 -

TOTAL = $55,000</p>
<p><b><i>THE IMPACT</i></b></p>
<p>Help us
build a future where we listen to each other's stories and celebrate our roots.
Help us build a future where we stand united as a community. Help us build a
future where young artists share their creativity and learn the skills to grow
as leaders and strengthen the communities around them. We know that art not
only transforms public spaces but also transforms lives.</p>
<p><b><i>OUR
PARTNERS</i></b></p>
<p>Of course,
there is a great deal of planning, preparation, and partnership that goes into
a project of this scale. We feel privileged to have received fiscal sponsorship
from Ping Chong + Company and to have already established community
partnerships with three incredible organizations in Sunset Park: The Dedalus
Foundation, Turning Point, and Uprose Brooklyn. Our mural will be on the front
facade of Turning Point's main office building, where they offer various
services for the homeless population, including primary medical care, mental
health services, warm showers and a laundry program. Learn more about these
amazing organizations and their positive impact by visiting their websites

My voice matters because I'm a mom who has <a href=""http://amaeyshah.blogspot.com/2011/09/amaey-our-darling-amaey.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">lost a beautiful child</a> to cancer after 6 years of on again and off again treatment and a chemo induced relapse.</b></p>
<p>Once the family gets the diagnosis their life is turned upside down. They do not have time to focus on themselves or let alone think about supplementing and balancing their child's already strained life.</p>
<p>When I saw that my son <a href=""http://amaeyshah.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amaey</a>, felt relief and peace from doing art in his hospital room, whether it was during short or long stays for chemo, and when playing on his keyboard and creating music, it was then that I realized the power of art. I realized what art was doing for him. It was giving him a chance to escape and create a life he liked. </p>
<h4>For him cancer was an inconvenience but art was an escape, into a world he controlled and created.  </h4>

Thank you so much for a successful campaign ! We reached our goal and beyond and we are eternally grateful to you all. Heres to the 1000 hours of empowerment and creating memories for our kids touched by cancer !






Why focus on Art? Why not Research?
Research will someday find more effective ways to treat cancer. But until that day arrives, according to National Cancer Institute, “Cancer is the leading cause of death by disease among U.S. children between infancy and age 14"". 
""Each year around 13,500 children are diagnosed with cancer in the US, that’s more than a classroom of kids a day"".
Every child and family have to go through chemotherapy and other extended treatment protocols that are physically and mentally debilitating.
We at Kids & Art are here for every single one of these children and families while they are braving through cancer. 

Our Goal is to focus on the NOW and create memorable experiences through their journey because Cancer Sucks. Art Heals!


 Why Kids & Art?
Only 4% of money goes towards childhood cancer research and substantially less than that goes towards any Art, Music and Wellness programs for childhood cancer patients and families.
Whether we like it or not, kids do get cancer. We might not be able to take their cancer away but we can definitely be there for them through their journey, through art as an outlet and an escape. This is what we at Kids & Art offer these children, their families and their care circle.

Our hope is that Kids & Art will create healing, peace, and lasting memories for every family touched by cancer. Cancer Sucks. Art Heals!

Why is my story important or different from anyone else. My voice matters because I am a mom whose child was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 3. My voice matters because I'm a mom who has lost a beautiful child to cancer after 6 years of on again and off again treatment and a chemo induced relapse.
Once the family gets the diagnosis their life is turned upside down. They do not have time to focus on themselves or let alone think about supplementing and balancing their child's already strained life.
When I saw that my son Amaey, felt relief and peace from doing art in his hospital room, whether it was during short or long stays for chemo, and when playing on his keyboard and creating music, it was then that I realized the power of art. I realized what art was doing for him. It was giving him a chance to escape and create a life he liked. 
For him cancer was an inconvenience but art was an escape, into a world he controlled and created.

Help us give 1000 hours of empowerment and create memories!


All we ask for is $25. From 500 people, we can make our goal! It takes a village to raise a child, so let's gather the village and continue to empower through art! 
For the price of a mani-pedi or a nice business lunch, these kids would be able to get hours of creativity and a chance to be a child and forget about their cancer
Free workshops for the families. We will bring in amazing artists, musicians, wellness practitioners, and all art supplies and utilities


What is the value for these kids who are trapped in the continuous cycle of treatment to escape for an afternoon?
Just $25 for one hour!
What is the cost for 1 day of hospital stay for pediatric cancer patient?
$40,400






Why do we need your support?


We have been invited to expand our program to Family House! 
Family House in San Francisco, serves as a home away from home for families of children with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses by providing physical comfort and emotional support, free from financial concerns. 
Family House has invited us to bring our Art Workshops, Music Therapy, Breathing and Mindfulness Workshops for their 40 room facility.
This program is on top of our already existing workshops.






Our stories:







Read more testimonials from our artists, families, and volunteers.


75% of our families are referred to us by their hospital social workers

Our primary target population are children touched by cancer from 3-18 years of age.
We create with children who are in-treatment, survivors, siblings, best friends, as well as children of parents who are undergoing cancer treatment.  




We also support families who are in hospice, as well as bereaved families through special art workshops. Cancer Sucks. Art Heals!
85% of our families come from Bay Area Hospitals like Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital. 15 % of families are from Kaiser, CPMC, and UCSF. (this ratio will change in the coming years)
We've created workshops at Google, Dreamworks and Pixar Studios. As well as local schools, local Artists’ studios, Redwood City Art Center, Peninsula Museum, and Los Gatos Museum, to name a few.





Our 2014-15 Focus 
Along with our new program at Family House, we will continue offering wonderful creative opportunities to our families through our monthly art workshops. We will grow from 8 workshops from last art season to 14 workshops for this art season. 










Cancer Sucks. Art Heals, Music Rocks and Mindfulness is not just for the sick child!
If you support this statement then Give the Gift of Presence, healing the family as a whole through treatment, remission and even bereavement. Help us Empower our kids and families.

Facts about Pediatric Cancer Incidence and Mortality:

Each year around 13,500 children are diagnosed with cancer in the US, that’s more than a classroom of kids a day.
35,000 children are currently in treatment for cancer.
On average a treatment for childhood cancer diagnosis is two years.
The average age of death for a child with cancer is 8, causing a child to lose 69 years of expected life.
Cancer kills more children than AIDs, asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis and congenital anomalies combined.
Cancer treatment can cause serious side effects that may last a lifetime
Research on the emotional impact of childhood cancer finds that parents and siblings report even greater long term emotional impacts than the diagnosed child.
The death of a child is one of the most traumatic events a family might face.
Families who have lost children are often financially and emotionally depleted.


Facts about Pediatric Cancer Survivors:

74% of childhood cancer survivors have chronic illnesses, and some 40% of childhood cancer survivors have severe illnesses or die from such illnesses.
Radiation to a child’s brain can significantly damage cognitive function, or if radiation is given at a very young age, limiting the ability to read, do basic math, tell time or even talk.
Physical and neurocognitive disabilities resulting from treatment may prevent childhood cancer survivors from fully participating in school, social activities and eventually work, which can cause depression and feelings of isolation.

While Temple's have been around for a long time at Burning Man, Interfuse has been without one for some time. This is an opportunity to introduce (or reintroduce) this community to temple culture while also allowing each individual the opportunity to radically express the vulnerable parts of themselves anonymously or publicly in front of our community.</p>
<p>All of its inner walls are lined with seating that face inward. This is intentional since it isolates the space and allows those inside the temple to interact with eachother. At its center, there is a tree which will be burned the final night at Interfuse. At the base of that tree, are wooden leafs crafted in such a way that they can be written on and hung by participants. </p>
<p>At the end of Interfuse, the temple itself will be deconstructed, stored, and brought back the following year until the ""introduction"" period is complete. Then, it will be burned in its entirity. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Why a fundraiser?</h3> <p>The temple is a community-sized art project with a community sized budget. While several individuals have stepped up to help fund initial costs and we are seeking an art grant from the Interfuse board, there still are significant financial hurtles. </p>
<p>Wood materials alone are estimated at over $1800</p>
<p>Transportation/fuel is estimated around $360</p>
<p>Lighting, power, writing materials, signage, and other costs extend the costs to the proposed amount we have set. So, you can see how the numbers start to add up. </p>
<p>If you want this piece at Interfuse in 2015 and have the financial means to contribute, any amount would help spread out the financial burden and bring us closer to making this project a reality.</p>

</div><div> <p>One of the most transformative parts of the Burning Man culture is Radical Self Expression when paired with Participation and Immediacy. When these 3 principles are combined, you find yourself actively and presently living the most authentic version of yourself. Many times this is in extroverted celebration but, sometimes, it may require you to be introspective and maybe even sorrowful. Not every part of us is bright and vibrant. Some parts are dark and full of regret, anger, or shame. It should be obvious then that a sacred space where these parts of ourselves can be safely expressed be available to participants whenever they need it. The Temple of Introduction is intended to be that space for this community. We would be honored for you to be a part of this effort.</p>

us not to close. After that much support we realized we are not giving up,

<p>After only <strong>one year</strong> of self-employment Oil &amp; Birch has outgrown its little home studio! It's time to move out of the spare bedroom workspace and into a <strong>beautiful downtown retail &amp; studio </strong>location. I'm raising community funds to help cover our renovation costs and support my dream of creating a safe, welcoming, and beautiful store and creative work space for me, my customers and other local artists! </p>
<p>My name is Brin Steeves (she/her) and I'm a full-time artist &amp; potter creating in Amiskwaciy-Waskahikan (Edmonton, AB) on Treaty 6 land. My art practice has always been about expression, community and connection. This new studio will provide me <strong>and local artists a space to host workshops, teach, learn, connect and grow together</strong>. It will embody my core values: respect, community, inclusivity, care and vulnerability. For years I've dreamed of lining the walls of a shop with my pottery and artwork, and I'm so thrilled to have an opportunity to do so!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How will this studio be used?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The front half of the space will be used as a store, to <strong>sell locally</strong> with ease!</li>
<li>
<strong>Host workshops</strong>, art clubs, paint nights and other community gatherings (once safe to do so) </li>
<li>
<strong>Provide other artists with a workshop space</strong> to teach, learn and connect. </li>
<li>Host <strong>pop up sales</strong>, spoken word and lil musical performances (again, once safe with covid)</li>
<li>Foster a safe environment for LGBTQ2s+ and Queer folks.</li>
<li>Allow ample space for <strong>new ceramic skills</strong>, such as slip casting, hand building, reclaiming (recycling) clay, etc. </li>
<li>Expand productivity and business opportunities </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What sort of renovations will this funding support?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mend and paint the enormous 20-foot walls</li>
<li>Create a beautiful, functional shop! Including decor, shelving, tables, and clothing racks for up-and-coming merch! </li>
<li>Build multiple custom work tables </li>
<li>Improve the staircase to the loft</li>
<li>Install lighting and shelving throughout the space</li>
<li>Give the kitchen and bathroom a small facelift </li>
<li>Purchase tools, furniture and equipment to ensure a functional, well-stocked workshop space </li>
</ul>
<p>If we surpass our financial goal, funds will be used for furnishings such as plants, candles, furniture, frames for art, blinds, etc. Any remaining funds will go towards operating costs!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What's in it for donors?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sick gifts when you donate! Check out the perks on my page and claim some unreal deals on ceramics, and workshops! My pottery can be tough to come by, my online sales often sell out within 5 minutes - so this is a great opportunity to snag some wares and help grow my business.</li>
<li>Edmonton local? By supporting this fundraiser you're actively investing in a <strong>new art space</strong> in your city! You'll *eventually* have access to pottery workshops hosted by Brin, and other artists of various mediums!  Plus <strong>you'll be able to shop Oil &amp; Birch pottery in person</strong>. No more fighting for a piece in online sales!!</li>
<li>Not a local? Don't worry, I'll still accept customs and do online shop updates every few months! Just know that your donation, big or small, is appreciated! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>

<p>My future studio is in a secure building located in Edmonton's downtown core, only a couple  of blocks away from MacEwan University and City Center Mall. Easily accessible by bus, LRT, bike and car. To gain access to the building guests are required to buzz up. My unit is on the 3rd floor, in the ""Co-loft"" artist lofts! It is accessible by stairs or elevator (with ramps for those with mobility restrictions, and wheelchair users).</p>
<p>*It should be noted that the buzzer system is rather high and may require assistance for those in wheelchairs. If you require help with the buzzer, doors or ramps please contact me personally and I'll be happy to come down to aid*</p>
<p>My beautiful, bright loft is right next door to one of Edmonton's raddest tattoo shops - Right Hand Tattoo, and down the hall from an equally rad print shop River Valley Printing Co. I can't wait to be apart of the creative community in this building. Working alone in my home studio for the past year has definitely impacted my mental health, and I look forward to shooting the shit with my buddies on the daily.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A final thanks! </h3>
<p>To anyone who donates, shares, and supports this goal - thank you. From the bottom of my heart, I appreciate any and all support. Edmonton has already helped me build an in-demand business, and take the leap into full-time employment - so I can't wait to see where my business goes from here with this unique, exciting project. All my love - Brin</p>
</div></div>","After only one year of self-employment Oil & Birch has outgrown its little home studio! It's time to move out of the spare bedroom workspace and into a beautiful downtown retail & studio location. I'm raising community funds to help cover our renovation costs and support my dream of creating a safe, welcoming, and beautiful store and creative work space for me, my customers and other local artists! 
My name is Brin Steeves (she/her) and I'm a full-time artist & potter creating in Amiskwaciy-Waskahikan (Edmonton, AB) on Treaty 6 land. My art practice has always been about expression, community and connection. This new studio will provide me and local artists a space to host workshops, teach, learn, connect and grow together. It will embody my core values: respect, community, inclusivity, care and vulnerability. For years I've dreamed of lining the walls of a shop with my pottery and artwork, and I'm so thrilled to have an opportunity to do so!
 

How will this studio be used?

The front half of the space will be used as a store, to sell locally with ease!

Host workshops, art clubs, paint nights and other community gatherings (once safe to do so) 

Provide other artists with a workshop space to teach, learn and connect. 
Host pop up sales, spoken word and lil musical performances (again, once safe with covid)
Foster a safe environment for LGBTQ2s+ and Queer folks.
Allow ample space for new ceramic skills, such as slip casting, hand building, reclaiming (recycling) clay, etc. 
Expand productivity and business opportunities 

 
What sort of renovations will this funding support?

Mend and paint the enormous 20-foot walls
Create a beautiful, functional shop! Including decor, shelving, tables, and clothing racks for up-and-coming merch! 
Build multiple custom work tables 
Improve the staircase to the loft
Install lighting and shelving throughout the space
Give the kitchen and bathroom a small facelift 
Purchase tools, furniture and equipment to ensure a functional, well-stocked workshop space 

If we surpass our financial goal, funds will be used for furnishings such as plants, candles, furniture, frames for art, blinds, etc. Any remaining funds will go towards operating costs!
 
What's in it for donors?

Sick gifts when you donate! Check out the perks on my page and claim some unreal deals on ceramics, and workshops! My pottery can be tough to come by, my online sales often sell out within 5 minutes - so this is a great opportunity to snag some wares and help grow my business.
Edmonton local? By supporting this fundraiser you're actively investing in a new art space in your city! You'll *eventually* have access to pottery workshops hosted by Brin, and other artists of various mediums!  Plus you'll be able to shop Oil & Birch pottery in person. No more fighting for a piece in online sales!!
Not a local? Don't worry, I'll still accept customs and do online shop updates every few months! Just know that your donation, big or small, is appreciated! 


 
Ways you can help!


Financial donations -  every dollar is appreciated and gets us closer to a renovated space! Plus we've got some rad perks as thank you gifts for your generosity! 

Bid on one of my instagram auctions! I've curated some kickass holiday bundles, filled with art donated by local pals!! Tattoo time, prints, leather goods, gift cards, resin art, jewelry, and more! 
Spread the word!! Share this campaign on your social media platforms. Tell your friends and fam!!
Donate a gift card! Ikea, Zocalo, Michael's, Home Depot, Winners/Homesense, all super helpful!! (Contact me by email, fb or instagram to donate a gift card)
Follow me on Patreon! That small monthly donation of 5 or 10$ will give you access to tons of behind the scenes content, and will go directly towards my studio's monthly bills. www.Patreon.com/oilandbirch

Known for its strength, this material is often used in aerospace engineering.Fun to play! ""Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.""- STEVE JOBS ""Make it simple, but significant."" - DON DRAPERThe Golden Ratio is a universal pattern that can be observed in so many structures found in nature: from the balanced proportions of tiny butterfly wings up to the hypnotic whorls of giant spiral galaxies. This ratio equals 1.618 and has been used by great painters like Leonardo da Vinci and other creative minds throughout history. The fact that the beauty of natural beings can actually be described by a mathematical principle inspired us during every aspect of the KOSMOS design process.

<p>Hello, my name is Nya and this is the first divination deck I ever created. For years, I have used painting to express my inner shadows in search for release. In 2018 and 2019, I fought my way through surfacing trauma by not only painting, but finding confidence and comfort in showing that creative side of me to the world. I began to create a small following and with the encouragement of friends and family, I started to sell my work. When the pandemic hit and I had time, I started to create this deck. I would work on a piece and then recognize something within the lines that took me back into the archives of past paintings. I quickly realized what an incredible journey it had been and that I already had so much to share. So I created this Oracle from all that I felt and all that I learned in the past few years. The deck itself is my way of acknowledging that I went through some difficult times, but here I am on the other side of it. It's my way of releasing what needs to be left in the past and trying to do some good with it. Traveling through a deep darkness requires many levels of bravery and fearlessness as well as acceptance, rest and sometimes a little defeat. </p>
<p>I fell... a lot, but I kept getting back up.</p>
<p>Now, I bring spiritual guidance and reflection in hopes to offer others a safe place to land or a gentle hand to help them get back up. </p>

<h3>The Deck</h3> <p>There are 58 cards total in each Tattered Wings Oracle Deck. 37 of them feature a message for inspiration, contemplation or a little kick in the rear. In addition to your message, there is a guided meditation prompt and a mantra to repeat throughout the day to keep the energies of the message active. 13 cards are Ritual Cards. These cards suggest an exercise, outing or even (my favorite) a quiet reset indoors with all of your favorite comfort items. I chose 13 ritual cards because there are 13 Full Moons in a calendar year and that is a great day to connect or reconnect to the LIFE all around and within us.  The remaining 8 cards are intuitive cards. These don't have meaning or a message, but instead are there to help you develop using your intuition in card reading. Let the images, the colors and the energy speak to you each time they come up. Maybe you write your own meaning or maybe you allow the message to change each time you see it-its up to you and a great way to really make this deck your own. </p>

<h3>The Timeline and Money stuff</h3>
<p>In October 2020, I launched The Tattered Wings Oracle on kickstarter and it was funded in less than three hours with my total funding hitting <strong>297%!</strong></p>
<p>Since then I launched a Lenormand deck that was funded at just over <strong>110% </strong>and The Fools Tarot deck that was funded this past year at <strong>262%.</strong> All of these decks will be available to add to your pledge!</p>
<p>This campaign will end on August 9th. This is my first time campaigning through Indiegogo so I'm not certain how long it takes to receive my funds. Once Received, your decks will be ordered with a three week turnaround time. I expect deliver from my production team by mid September and will immediately ship out to you. </p>
<p>My campaign goal is low because I have already created the deck and done the work needed to start this small indie business. With the relationship I have created with my production team, I am no longer required to purchase large quantities of decks. This makes this whole process easy for me and you will receive your deck MUCH FASTER than campaigns in the early stages of creation and planning. </p>
<p>The reason I am launching this deck again is to be able to purchase enough to keep in stock. I am grateful to receive so many orders for this oracle deck, but it's time to start thinking a little bigger and getting them into the local owned shops that we all love so much. This campaign will allow me to have the overstock to offer and sell to my customers without the production wait. </p>
<h3>The Artist</h3>
<p>I began painting when I purchased my first home and couldn't quite afford beautiful art for my walls. To this day, if I have an empty wall screaming for color, I'll grab a canvas and just let the colors needed in the space, be my first inspiration. I am partial to using acrylic paints, but recently have begun to mix medias in order to increase the texture and flow on my paintings. Each one is multiple layers that expressed whatever was coming up at the time. I always paint with music in my ear. I feel like the notes and the lyrics are what wake that which is sleeping within. I've recently read that Empaths don't just listen to music in the background, it's an experience that they feel run through them again and again. This is exactly what happens when I'm before a canvas.</p>
<p>The female that continues to show up in my work, is painted in my image-but the strong, fearless and powerful version that I try to convince myself really is me. Sometimes I paint without any direction or thought and then stand back after a few hours and just cry. As if I didn't know what was coming out until it presented itself. I've always said, I don't paint...my paintings paint themselves, I simply hold the brush and love them deeply as they emerge. </p>

Moyle River, in the Northern Territory.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>I am an artist. Everyone in my
family are artists. My inspiration for my art comes from my Aboriginal culture
and country and the deep connection that my family share with it.</p>
<p>I am also a primary school
teacher, consultant, workshop facilitator,<b> </b>public speaker and children’s book author. I have written and collaborated on several
children’s books. “Pilawuk - When I Was Young” by Janeen Brian is my story about
being forcibly taken from my family - Stolen Generation story.</p>
<p>My greatest strength is in
teaching and sharing my story and my arts practice with others as a way to help
them to find ways to experience “Dadirri.” Dadirri is a concept in my culture,
which my big sister Miriam-Rose Baumann has written about, finding “the stream
within,” perhaps similar to what you might call inner peace. Imagine if
everyone contributed to the healing and wellbeing of others. My process in my
workshops and as a teacher is about developing shared stories to create meaning
using textile arts, mainly with children. Through this process I help people to
achieve that sense of inner peace and to build respectful relationships within
themselves and with others. </p>

film above. You will get a greater sense of who I am, how my country inspires

<p>Learning new textile techniques helps me to broaden my arts practice and bring new processes into my teaching and workshops.<b> </b>And, collaborating with and learning from other artists who work through similar values related to their cultural heritage and practices (like Aboubakar) helps me to deliver creative workshops that not only share my artistic skills and ideas but which also help me to connect with people in the spirit of reconciliation and healing. <br/></p>
<p>Much of my work is about inspiring children and adults to explore my Aboriginal culture, their own cultural traditions and to think and learn about the cultures of other countries throughout the world.</p>

will serve as a comprehensive introduction to dyeing with natural dyes, also
suitable for people with dyeing experience to extend their repertoire and
techniques. <br/></p>
<p>The main focus is Aboubakar Fofana's speciality, the fermented West
African indigo dye-vat, made using the whole indigo leaves and fermented over a
week to ten days to produce a dye of unmatchable colour and fastness. Whilst we
wait for the fermented dye-vat to reach maturity, we will be shown other dyes,
including powdered fructose (quick vat) indigo, mineral mud-dye, and a host of
other colours from madder, cochieal, weld, oak-gall and catechu.</p>

Ngaiyi PilawukNgaiyi wur Ngangiwumerri ngiDede ngaiyi Malfiyin.
I’m PilawukMy language is NgangiwumerriMy country is Malfyin, along the
Moyle River, in the Northern Territory.

I am an artist. Everyone in my
family are artists. My inspiration for my art comes from my Aboriginal culture
and country and the deep connection that my family share with it.
I am also a primary school
teacher, consultant, workshop facilitator, public speaker and children’s book author. I have written and collaborated on several
children’s books. “Pilawuk - When I Was Young” by Janeen Brian is my story about
being forcibly taken from my family - Stolen Generation story.
My greatest strength is in
teaching and sharing my story and my arts practice with others as a way to help
them to find ways to experience “Dadirri.” Dadirri is a concept in my culture,
which my big sister Miriam-Rose Baumann has written about, finding “the stream
within,” perhaps similar to what you might call inner peace. Imagine if
everyone contributed to the healing and wellbeing of others. My process in my
workshops and as a teacher is about developing shared stories to create meaning
using textile arts, mainly with children. Through this process I help people to
achieve that sense of inner peace and to build respectful relationships within
themselves and with others. 
Please take 5 minutes to watch my
film above. You will get a greater sense of who I am, how my country inspires
my practice and what my campaign is about.

I have a goalIn mid-January I plan to travel
to Mullumbimby to study with Aboubakar Fofana a Malian/French Indigo dye
specialist in one of his ten day workshops.

Aboubakar possesses a similar love for
textiles and respect for the natural environment - you can learn more about Aboubakar here or in my video. 
Learning new textile techniques helps me to broaden my arts practice and bring new processes into my teaching and workshops. And, collaborating with and learning from other artists who work through similar values related to their cultural heritage and practices (like Aboubakar) helps me to deliver creative workshops that not only share my artistic skills and ideas but which also help me to connect with people in the spirit of reconciliation and healing. 
Much of my work is about inspiring children and adults to explore my Aboriginal culture, their own cultural traditions and to think and learn about the cultures of other countries throughout the world.

Adele and Emily, two photographers, and graduates from a 3 year-intensive photo
program in Montreal.  Since graduation, we had both been working
throughout the Summer of 2013.  On a quest to re-inspire herself, Emily
worked nearly full-time in order to fund her European journey.  Adele had
been working and interning, in order to gain some experience, while getting her
foot in the door.  Upon Emily's return, she found herself incredibly
fortunate for her beautiful (photographic) experiences, and yet frustrated by
the fact that she felt like she wouldn't be able to continue to immerse herself
into travels and culture for another while.  Adele and Emily brainstormed
some ideas as they were both tired with the current state of the art and
photography world, where work is hardly commissioned beyond credit and
typically goes unseen.  The additional factor to all this, was they found

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are very resourceful here, and our very small budget rarely stops us from reaching our goals. However in order to complete our 501c3 application for federal tax exemption we need to raise money to pay for professional review of our application and the submission fee to the IRS. We just can't DIY our way out of this one, so we really need your help!!!<br/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to earn approximately $2200 in order to pay for professional assistance in completing our 501c3, which can cost up to $1250, as well as the $850 filing fee to the IRS. Even if we don't meet our goal, we will put this money towards a slightly lower level of assistance with our application . If we exceed our goal, the funds will go straight into our Educational Outreach Program!! </p>
