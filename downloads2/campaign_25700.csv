</div></div>","Our Story


The Threadbare Sex was the inaugural production of  Coryphaeus Theater Company three years ago, when Mara Lileas, Naomi McDougall Jones, Mia Romero, Gwenevere Sisco, and Elspeth Turner came together to tell a story - an innovative and breathtaking exploration of justice, freedom, love, loneliness, and power through the eyes of three women.  Written by Mia and Naomi, The Threadbare Sex follows three iconic Greek women, Antigone, Cassandra, and Electra, from Ancient Greece, through an 1860s drawing room comedy, and into the present day. In each re-incarnation, the women wrangle with their own fates and what it means to be the threadbare sex. 
The Threadbare Sex was first performed in July 2008 at the Rose Nagelberg Theatre, as part of the Strawberry One-act Festival, in which it was a finalist and Gwenevere Sisco was nominated for Best Director.  Due to the fantastic response, it was further developed and produced full-scale in September 2008 at Manhattan Repertory Theatre.  Coryphaeus has continued to produce daring and powerful theatre on shoestring budget, and now we have the chance to present Threadbare Sex at Manhattan Theatre Source, as part of Unsex Me Here: A Night of Two Plays, opening July 11th.  
We have a revamped and revitalized script, a wildly talented cast which now includes Veronica del Cerro, and a magnificent venue - all we need now is your support!


  


The Impact

Coryphaeus is aiming to revolutionize theatre by making the female voice and presence a definitive force onstage. We tell these stories because we believe they need to be told.  This is why we produce them from our own pockets.  But if you’ve ever peeked into the pockets of a New York City starving artist, you can probably imagine the challenge ahead of us.  So your donation not only supports groundbreaking independent theatre, but it also means that our food/shelter piggybanks remain intact!



What We Need & What You Get
Our budgetary needs:  We’re serious bargain-hunters, so we’re keeping the budget extremely tight.  That said, Rehearsal space alone will cost us approximately $300, paying our crew will require another $200, and printing costs for programs and marketing materials tend to add up to $50-100.  We’re hoping the rest will cover all our costume/prop/set needs.It would be lovely if we could pay our actors for their time and extraordinary talent, but that depends on what’s leftover.  Rest assured that whether or not we make our goal, every little bit of your donation will go toward this production.  



Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word!  Tell all your friends about this fantastic opportunity to support our Theatre Company.  And most of all, COME SEE OUR SHOW!!!  We’re nothing without our audience, so please mark your calendars, invite everyone you know, and let us thank you in person for your support.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>PARKER &amp; DIZZY RETURN TO NEW YORK!</h3>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that Parker &amp; Dizzy's Fabulous Journey to the End of the Rainbow is returning to New York City for a limited engagement. Running January 9th to the 26th! Here's what critics said about our production when it premiered at the New York International Fringe Festival in 2011:</p>
<p>“By far the best play I’ve seen so far at this year’s Fringe
is <i style="""">Parker &amp; Dizzy’s Fabulous Journey
to the End of the Rainbow</i>, a head-spinningly fun campy musical ode to every
gay icon from Crawford to Gaga. I was expecting a low rent version of another
gay musical, but it’s so much better and smarter than that. Be warned the humor
is campier than an episode of RuPaul’s Drag Race with rapid-fire vaudevillian
one-liners and well crafted but broad musical numbers… I can honestly say that
Parker &amp; Dizzy’s acting and production values were better than the last
Broadway show I saw.” – <b>Chris Thomas, Out-FM</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""></p>

<p> </p>Highlighted by Huffington Post as one of ‘The Best Shows of
2011.’ “<span style="""">This is the most promising
musical I saw at FringeFest.” – <b>Michael Giltz, Huffington Post</b></span>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""""></span></p><p> </p></span>”I am happy to
report that “Parker and Dizzy,” a warped re-imagining of “The Wizard of Oz”
with detours into “Star Wars,” “Thelma and Louise,” “Ghost,” and a hundred
other pop-cultural landmarks, is a joyous, loopy romp – precisely the kind of
show you dream of discovering at FringeNYC. Beneath the jibes and jokes and
camp, “parker and Dizzy” is an old-fashioned musical with a heart of gold,
wanting little more than to make sense of a cruel world. People help each
other. Good triumphs over evil. Love saves the day. And hope springs eternal.” –<b>

This show is about my journey with my son, Aidan, who had a stroke at 2 weeks old due to hospital bacteria.  He subsequently had 6 brain surgeries, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, cognitive impairment, and ongoing seizures.It is the
story of my family, a middle class family that lost everything (including our
sense of humor for a while), due to an unexpected medical catastrophe.
 This is the journey from fear to love, anger to acceptance, depression to
joy. It is an honest account of our ongoing roller coaster ride - one that is
familiar to special needs families and those who’ve suffered chronic illness.I taught acting at Harvard, and have worked in theatre,
commercials and film.   I have
been writing and performing autobiographical shows for 20 years, but this one
is extremely special.  The
overwhelming response I have received from people who’ve heard my story or seen
it is; “Everyone must see this show. 
It is important.” 
I want to
share this story with as many people as possible, not just your average
theatergoer.   I plan to take it to numerous theatres and organizations in
as many cities as possible.  The types of organizations I believe can
benefit from this performance are: 
Special Needs, Healthcare, Parenting, PTSD, Psychology, Women’s groups,
Spiritual, Motivational and Comic.
 
My intention
is to “use my gifts” of acting and writing to bring catharsis, comfort and laughter to
others who have been through trauma or are currently struggling. 
 
 
What We Need and What You Get 
1.  This is the funding I need:    $40,000.00
To co-produce the show in Los
Angeles and Washington, D.C.
The Money raised will be used
for:
Theatre Rental
Lighting Designer
Video and Sound Designer
Music
Stage Manager
Lighting Technician
Marketing
Director 
Actor
Theatre Staff 
Costumes
Set and Props
Transportation
                       
I will continue fundraising beyond this initial goal.  My intention is to raise $300,000 so I
can perform the show all over the world, in as many theatres and for as many
organizations as possible.
  
The Perks 
Because Duct tape is
“stronger than the wind,” and my daughter Caroline happens to love making  “ductcessories,”  we’ll be offering one of a kind duct tape creations as our gifts to you for any donations over $50.00                          Bracelet!

<p>Hi!

<p><strong>When you help fund this campaign, you are supporting passionate and gifted dancers by giving them the opportunity to do their work in a small, regional setting that would otherwise have very little dance.  With your support, the artists will be able to...</strong></p>
<p>1. work with and inspire local children</p>
<p>2. provide free dance performances for the community</p>
<p>3. enhance, diversify and strengthen the cultural fabric of our very small island</p>

<p>1. Employ 6 local dancers, full-time for a 30 week season annually.  <strong>$500/week ($90,000) </strong></p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Kyla:  When we make the assumption that good dance is 'out there', that it is reserved for NYC/LA/etc...We're making the decision to, in a way, silence part of our voice as a community.  Dance is such an innate, expressive, direct reaction to our surroundings, and since I consider myself mostly a 'jazz' dancer, this statement rings so true to me: it's in my heart. When I create movement, it's simply my soul using my muscles to say what it wants.  I'm not even aware of why or how, it just happens.  And it's such a force, that I can't stop it, I can't judge it and I certainly can't quit it - No matter what.  It's such an honest force.  I need to share it.  I need to share it because children deserve to be inspired by people who lead their lives with their hearts.  I need to share it because Key West is starved for dance.  I need to share it for reasons that I don't even understand.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
</div></span></div>","Hi! I'm Kyla and I'm the Artistic Director of Key West Contemporary Dance Co.  We're working hard to fund our 2013-2014 season because we believe that dance is a vital part of every community.  We want Key West to have a strong and viable dance scene.  Over the past five years, we've done some great shows, like 1969 for example, but so far we've only been able to work on a project-to-project basis...Now we're ready to take the next step: A 30 week annual season!
When you help fund this campaign, you are supporting passionate and gifted dancers by giving them the opportunity to do their work in a small, regional setting that would otherwise have very little dance.  With your support, the artists will be able to...
1. work with and inspire local children
2. provide free dance performances for the community
3. enhance, diversify and strengthen the cultural fabric of our very small island
Currently our only scheduled perfomance this year is the A-T benefit at Lincoln Center, hosted by Priscilla Lopez, produced by Eric Weinberger.  Yes! We're at Lincoln Center, but we currently have no funding for shows in Key West.  You can help us change this.
What We Need & What You Get
We need to...
1. Employ 6 local dancers, full-time for a 30 week season annually.  $500/week ($90,000) 
2. Employ 4 visiting dancers full-time for 6 weeks.  $400/week ($9600)
-total per diem ($2982)
-total airfare ($1200)
-housing (We are currently seeking generous donations from local hotels.)


Total Artist Costs:
$103,782
The total sum of $103, 782 will ensure the following outlined goals happen:

1. Create & Present
We will create and present 3 original, full-length shows over the span of a 30 week season at local theatres, parks, and other venues each with a legit run and ample preparation time to ensure artistic excellence. These performances would vary in price range (FREE & Up!), to ensure that everyone can be exposed to dance.  
 
2. OutReach

We will implement a dance program in which company members go into the schools to teach, inspire and perform with and for the children of Key West.This would last over a period of several weeks, twice yearly; With a steady focus on inspiring creativity, encouraging self-expression and boosting self-confidence.

 
3. Tour Locally 

Key West, Marathon, Key Largo.  We will perform throughout the Florida Keys in schools, parks, theatres and other venues.  We believe that dance is a vital part of every community and should be accessible to all.
 
4. Partner 
We will partner with local agencies to aid in fundraising through dance performance. We'd like to be able to perform at benefits free of charge.  Dance is a language that we all speak.  It Inspires; It Heals; It Unites!
 
What you get is....
 
The satisfaction of knowing that you just supported a dedicated, talented group of artists.... And one of our awesome perks over there to the right---->
If we don't reach our entire goal, your donation is certainly not in vain.  It simply means that we will keep plugging away, and working as hard as we possibly can until we do get there.

The Impact
Kyla:  When we make the assumption that good dance is 'out there', that it is reserved for NYC/LA/etc...We're making the decision to, in a way, silence part of our voice as a community.  Dance is such an innate, expressive, direct reaction to our surroundings, and since I consider myself mostly a 'jazz' dancer, this statement rings so true to me: it's in my heart. When I create movement, it's simply my soul using my muscles to say what it wants.  I'm not even aware of why or how, it just happens.  And it's such a force, that I can't stop it, I can't judge it and I certainly can't quit it - No matter what.  It's such an honest force.  I need to share it.  I need to share it because children deserve to be inspired by people who lead their lives with their hearts.  I need to share it because Key West is starved for dance.  I need to share it for reasons that I don't even understand.
But who the heck are we?!
CHECK OUT OUR 2012-2013 ARTISTS HERE.
We've been around for four years now. We're housed by the generous CoffeeMill Dance Studio.  We've received funding four times from The Florida Keys Council of the Arts and we are a 501c3 nonprofit.  We've had shows produced by The Waterfront Playhouse, and additionally we've presented shows at The Tennessee Williams Theatre, The San Carlos Institute and The Tropic Cinema.  We've done an enormous amount of good work on a shoestring budget.  This past August we were invited to show an excerpt from our popular show 1969 at Dixon Place as part of NYC10. Also, as I mentioned earlier, we have a performance coming up at Lincoln Center in April.  We are a delicious blend of local and visiting artists and we are committed to making this happen!

“BARE” OFF-BROADWAY BENEFIT PERFORMANCES FOR FOR HOMELESS LGBTQ YOUTH
 
Sponge Theatricals is in partnership with The Midtown Arts Common and the Saint Peters Church to bring the pop opera “bare” back to NYC from June 6th – 16th. “bare” is a benefit performance for Trinity Place Shelter for LGBTQ Youth. All proceeds from the production are given to Trinity Place Shelter, a non-sectarian, 10-bed transitional shelter for homeless LGBTQ youth located in Trinity Lutheran Church. The show is playing at The York Theatre Company at St. Peters on 54th st and Lexington Avenue. This limited engagement Off-Broadway run of “bare” is a beautiful example of the community giving back. The entire cast and crew have volunteered their time and talent to this project. It is dividing the production between the Sanctuary at Saint Peters Church and the York Theatre at Saint Peters. 
 
Director Devon James, who also works as a professional actor and producer in the city has just come off his successful production of Hairspray in Westchester, says “bare” has captured the hearts of so many. I'm honored to bring this story back to the NYC theater community and spread the message of love and self acceptance now in a historic time of change for equality for all.” This production features new Choreography by Christopher Nofkee and original Costume Designs by Angela Borst. Their goal with this production of “bare” is to bring a fresh edgy look to the popular story that fans have come to love.
 
While this show is hoping to give financial assistance to the shelter, it's also hoping to inspire the audience to be honest and comfortable with their own identity. BARE is set in a co-ed Roman Catholic boarding school where a storied love triangle with female classmate, Ivy, complicates Peter and Jason's closeted relationship. Jason spirals has he faces rejection from his parents, peers, priest, and lover.“It took a show like 'bare""'to give me that final push to accept myself and take the leap of faith that my family and peers may or may not accept me. ""bare"" moved me and I want to share this show with others in the hopes that they will feel the same way about it as I do. As the show says 'God don't make no trash' “ says Dalles Wilie, who plays Jason in this story of two boys struggling to hide their love from their peers.
 
Tickets are $25 at the door, $20 online before June 1st at www.spongenyc.com. Evening tickets (June 7th, 8th, 13th, 14th, & 15th @8pm) are going fast so advanced reservations are strongly suggested.

""Who are we?""

Sponge Thearicals is a group of creative spirits who have brought many productions to completion in NYC. Sponge performed a limited engagement of the musical ""bare"" in Albany to celebrate the legalization of Gay Marriage in New York. For more details on Sponge, visit www.spongenyc.com
 
 
""What is this ""bare"" thing about?""
This show has had such an emotional and creative impact on our company and cast. Doing this show even brought one of our cast members out of the closet!

“bare” is a pop opera that takes place a private Catholic School. We follow the emotional journey of group of friends as they reach the end of their Senior year. Dealing with currently relevant issues like sexual identity, teen pregnancy, drug abuse, bullying, obesity, and the daunting task of accepting yourself are a few of the show's themes. We follow Jason and Peter, two star crossed lovers who have to hide their same sex relationship from the judgmental voices of their peers and the school.
We now have the opportunity to bring this show back to NYC. This Version hasn't been done in NYC for a very long time. The version we are performing has many differences from the recent Off-Broadway version that played at New World Stages this past year. Both productions beautifully shared the same message and we are thrilled to continue spreading it.


It doesn't matter which Version is the Best, 'cause ""God Don't Make No Trash""!

I've been doing theatre for over a decade of my life, and I love it more than anything. It has been my dream to attend school in London for years. This summer, I was accepted into two courses at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts. The thing is, London is the most expensive city in the world. Because of the cost, I might not be able to stay the entire time. Donating money would help me with the chance of a lifetime! </span></font></h3><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>All the money you donate will be split between renting an apartment, plane tickets and the actual course fees. (Each course is 1400 American Dollars.) We will be renting a short term apartment- your money would help pay the rent for that as well. Some perks include: British Tea, candy, a hand-written postcard, a t-shirt or sweatshirt, a care package, etc. </p><p>Of course, any amount you can donate will help! </p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>I've wanted to attend school in London since I was 9 years old. LAMDA is one of my top two colleges. (Fun fact! Benedict Cumberbatch also attended LAMDA.) Attending these courses would give me the foot in the door that I would need to attend this school in my future.  </p><p>I've been dedicated to the Theatre since I was six years old. I currently work at Boulder's Dinner Theater, and attend Actor's Academy of the Preforming Arts. I spend at least 10 hours a week taking acting classes, dance classes, voice lessons, as well as teaching, choreographing and helping with various odd jobs. (An above picture is from my last show, Shrek the Musical. It is of me helping prep before a show.) Attending these LAMDA course would give me the base I need to finally begin professionally acting, as well as set me up for my future education. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Even if you can't donate money, share this around!

I've been doing theatre for over a decade of my life, and I love it more than anything. It has been my dream to attend school in London for years. This summer, I was accepted into two courses at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts. The thing is, London is the most expensive city in the world. Because of the cost, I might not be able to stay the entire time. Donating money would help me with the chance of a lifetime! What I Need & What You GetAll the money you donate will be split between renting an apartment, plane tickets and the actual course fees. (Each course is 1400 American Dollars.) We will be renting a short term apartment- your money would help pay the rent for that as well. Some perks include: British Tea, candy, a hand-written postcard, a t-shirt or sweatshirt, a care package, etc. Of course, any amount you can donate will help! The ImpactI've wanted to attend school in London since I was 9 years old. LAMDA is one of my top two colleges. (Fun fact! Benedict Cumberbatch also attended LAMDA.) Attending these courses would give me the foot in the door that I would need to attend this school in my future.  I've been dedicated to the Theatre since I was six years old. I currently work at Boulder's Dinner Theater, and attend Actor's Academy of the Preforming Arts. I spend at least 10 hours a week taking acting classes, dance classes, voice lessons, as well as teaching, choreographing and helping with various odd jobs. (An above picture is from my last show, Shrek the Musical. It is of me helping prep before a show.) Attending these LAMDA course would give me the base I need to finally begin professionally acting, as well as set me up for my future education. Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you can't donate money, share this around!

18 dances.  
9 choreographers from 5 different cities.  
16 performers.
3 separate programs over 1 weekend.

The Wrecking Project brings together nine choreographers (three trios) to work with wrecking as a creative methodology and present original works next to their wrecked versions illuminating the fluid nature of authorship and the provisional nature of meaning making.
 Julie Mayo and Kate Corby have invited a group of rigorous dance-makers with distinctive sensibilities to wreck, or re-imagine, one another's finished work, inspired by choreographer Susan Rethorst's work with wrecking dances in the mid 1990's.  The ""wrecking process"" parameters stipulate that the original work's performer(s) must remain the same, but everything else is fair game.The Wrecking Project is a part of a Links Hall Artistic Associates festival.April 12 - the New York Trio

<p>by Christopher Hoy from his original children’s story of the same name.<br/>Music &amp; Lyrics by Don Charles and Deb Gessner with additional lyrics by Judy Clothier</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 60px;""><strong>                                            The Story:</strong><em><br/> A large number of drought-weary forest animals temporarily take up residence in Prescott, and 9 year-old Tim Armstrong discovers a huge bull elk named Bill living in the attic above his bedroom. </em><em>He is not the only one at school with new animal friends.  The kids don’t have a problem with animals in town - but the grown-ups are not happy with the animal invasion and the situation erupts at a Town Council meeting. In the ensuing aftermath, Eagle returns from a trip to the top of the world with important news about the future of all living things.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Who/Where?</strong></h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.elksoperahousefoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>The Elks Opera House Foundation</strong></a>, a 501(c)3, brings the 2nd Annual production of <strong><em>The Elk in the Attic</em></strong><strong>, </strong>to the historic 108-year old Elks Opera House Theatre Stage, in <strong>Prescott Arizona</strong>! <strong>July 25-28, 2013</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Honoring and Supporting The Artists Who Make this Happen</strong></h2>
<p>We know we have to <strong>market </strong>a show and generally most grants and businesses find that easy to support. We are doing that <strong>AND </strong>the budget for this year’s production of <em>The Elk in the Attic</em> includes <strong>Artistic Personnel</strong>.</p>
<p>We will offer some financial support and recognition to all associated directly with the show - more than 25 - including director, musicians, choreographer, light and sound designers and operators, stage manager, actors and dancers. <strong>This covers rehearsal, skill-building workshops for the young cast, and performances.</strong></p>
<p>We believe in stepping up to the value of the arts by putting some dollars toward supporting those who provide live theatre in our community. <strong>The performing arts are a joy and gift as well as an essential thread in our cultural experience.</strong><br/><br/><strong>Your contribution</strong> will help us to cover the cost of travel to and from rehearsal and performance; recognize the expertise of professionals involved with this production (designers, director, musicians), and actively <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">demonstrate to our young actors that the performing arts is a respected, valuable component of our society.</span></strong></p>
<p>We want to bring this <strong>original family musical</strong> to the 108-year old Elks Opera House stage <strong>AND</strong> show <strong>respect and support</strong> for keeping the arts alive in our communities, leading by example in our work and our budgets.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR financial contribution</strong> will support both the production of<em> The</em> <em>Elk in the Attic</em> <br/> AND demonstrate to all the very real value of the performing arts and those who work so hard to give it to us.</p>
<h2><strong>Putting Our Money Where Our Passion Is</strong></h2>
<p>We have a cash budget of $24,000, plus $16,000 of in-kind including the superb costumes and masks from last year’s production.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Today we are asking for $8,250</strong> to compensate the Director (2,500), Musicians (2,000) Light/Sound Designers &amp; Operators (1,750), Choreographer ($500), Stage Manager ($1,000) and a total small stipend for each actor (500)<br/><strong>This is half of the ideal Artistic budget of $16,500.</strong></p>
<p>Additional funds are being sought through grants, sponsors and program ad sales. These will support marketing and PR costs first and then the rest of artistic personnel costs.</p>
<p><strong>The show will go on</strong> regardless of these funds being fully raised or not but it will be without the capacity to offer the financial recognition due to those who bring their expertise to make <em>The Elk in the Attic</em> the high quality production it will be.</p>
<p><em>All contributions are tax deductible to the full extent allowed by the law and include the small site percentage to Indiegogo and for transfer fees.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Putting YOU in the Program!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>When you support <em>The Elk in The Attic</em></strong> you will be recognized in the printed program, on the website and for really Big amounts ($1,000 +) as a <strong>Drought Breaker Show Sponso</strong>r and dinner with the playwright and director!</p>
<p>We have signed programs, posters, and the book on which this was all based signed by the author. And, of course, tickets to the show!  We will even have a few audio CDs of the show if you can’t make it in person and want to be a ‘Bill’.</p>
<p>Choose from various categories and join us as a <strong>Forest Animals,</strong> (Squirrel, Skink, Raccoon wily coyote), one of the <strong>Birds</strong> (Raven, Owl and Eagle) or as <strong>Bill the Elk</strong>!</p>

by Christopher Hoy from his original children’s story of the same name.Music & Lyrics by Don Charles and Deb Gessner with additional lyrics by Judy Clothier
                                            The Story: A large number of drought-weary forest animals temporarily take up residence in Prescott, and 9 year-old Tim Armstrong discovers a huge bull elk named Bill living in the attic above his bedroom. He is not the only one at school with new animal friends.  The kids don’t have a problem with animals in town - but the grown-ups are not happy with the animal invasion and the situation erupts at a Town Council meeting. In the ensuing aftermath, Eagle returns from a trip to the top of the world with important news about the future of all living things.
Who/Where?
The Elks Opera House Foundation, a 501(c)3, brings the 2nd Annual production of The Elk in the Attic, to the historic 108-year old Elks Opera House Theatre Stage, in Prescott Arizona! July 25-28, 2013
Honoring and Supporting The Artists Who Make this Happen
We know we have to market a show and generally most grants and businesses find that easy to support. We are doing that AND the budget for this year’s production of The Elk in the Attic includes Artistic Personnel.
We will offer some financial support and recognition to all associated directly with the show - more than 25 - including director, musicians, choreographer, light and sound designers and operators, stage manager, actors and dancers. This covers rehearsal, skill-building workshops for the young cast, and performances.
We believe in stepping up to the value of the arts by putting some dollars toward supporting those who provide live theatre in our community. The performing arts are a joy and gift as well as an essential thread in our cultural experience.Your contribution will help us to cover the cost of travel to and from rehearsal and performance; recognize the expertise of professionals involved with this production (designers, director, musicians), and actively demonstrate to our young actors that the performing arts is a respected, valuable component of our society.
We want to bring this original family musical to the 108-year old Elks Opera House stage AND show respect and support for keeping the arts alive in our communities, leading by example in our work and our budgets.
YOUR financial contribution will support both the production of The Elk in the Attic  AND demonstrate to all the very real value of the performing arts and those who work so hard to give it to us.
Putting Our Money Where Our Passion Is
We have a cash budget of $24,000, plus $16,000 of in-kind including the superb costumes and masks from last year’s production.
Today we are asking for $8,250 to compensate the Director (2,500), Musicians (2,000) Light/Sound Designers & Operators (1,750), Choreographer ($500), Stage Manager ($1,000) and a total small stipend for each actor (500)This is half of the ideal Artistic budget of $16,500.
Additional funds are being sought through grants, sponsors and program ad sales. These will support marketing and PR costs first and then the rest of artistic personnel costs.
The show will go on regardless of these funds being fully raised or not but it will be without the capacity to offer the financial recognition due to those who bring their expertise to make The Elk in the Attic the high quality production it will be.
All contributions are tax deductible to the full extent allowed by the law and include the small site percentage to Indiegogo and for transfer fees.
Putting YOU in the Program!
When you support The Elk in The Attic you will be recognized in the printed program, on the website and for really Big amounts ($1,000 +) as a Drought Breaker Show Sponsor and dinner with the playwright and director!
We have signed programs, posters, and the book on which this was all based signed by the author. And, of course, tickets to the show!  We will even have a few audio CDs of the show if you can’t make it in person and want to be a ‘Bill’.
Choose from various categories and join us as a Forest Animals, (Squirrel, Skink, Raccoon wily coyote), one of the Birds (Raven, Owl and Eagle) or as Bill the Elk!
The Impact - The Arts & Environmental Awareness
The Elks Opera House Foundation (EOHF) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit AZ corporation, dedicated to promoting the standing of the historic Elks Opera House and to actively supporting and participating in the performing arts, cultural and economic values of the Central Arizona Highlands.
The EOHF has been primarily responsible for the restoration and historical recognition of the Elks Opera House (EOH) for more than 10 years.  Advocating for the building, the Foundation has been present at all of the developments in its history over the last decade. and has segued into producing events in the EOH. In 2012, the AZ Centennial year, the EOHF mounted two world premieres by local playwrights, and this one is Back!
                                          A Double-Whammy!• Artistic Opportunity and Support to a local playwright, musicians, mask makers, costumers and actors - including adults and young people. The experienced older actors will be mentors and models as well as team players with enthusiastic young actors through workshops, rehearsal and performance.
• Consider how we will live with the competing demands on the natural resources and encroaching urban development on the natural habitat. Balancing environmental concerns and needs is at the heart of this original musical suitable for entire families, providing entertainment as well as thought-provoking material.
Extra: We are also dedicated to keeping ticket prices low enough to enable families to attend together, seated together in the beautifully restored 108year old theatre.

<p><span>Present Danger Productions is formed by two core members: Donna Marie Baratta and Jessica Carmichael. Donna Marie and I met while training in the MFA Directing Program at the University of Alberta in Canada. DM and I both share a passion for theatre that asks meaningful and difficult questions of our society when it comes to issues of violence, gender, race, class, familial issues and themes such as the conflicts between love and hate. We founded Present Danger Productions together to bring current and topical issues in our world to Canadian stages, with a focus on new and devised work. This Canadian work by Greg MacArthur speaks to us deeply, in fact we chose it as our first outing together with our new company because of its unique look at female violence. The play explores characters marginalized in some way through gender, sexuality or race.  As female directors, we want to explore why is female violence on the rise? And more importantly- female apathy?  </span></p>
<p><span>We believe strongly in our voices as female directors and part of our mandate is to create work that helps redefine and celebrate the unique possibilities of being female- and help give young women a chance to examine where we are at now in terms of looking at females in present pop culture, and how might we fight negative stereotypes. This play also shines a significant light on teen apathy- an issue we wish to probe in terms of how it might be countered- if at all.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>OUR CAMPAIGN: <em>Why It's Important</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Our campaign is to raise $4,000 towards production costs. Our piece will be part of Toronto's highly regarded and popular 2013 SummerWorks Festival. We need money to cover the cost of all design production elements: set, lights, costume and makeup as well as marketing expenses and festival fees. At this point all our artists involved are working in kind- with the hopes that we may make some money at the box office to split an honorary fee. </span></p>
<p><span><strong>THE MAGNITUDE OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This story needs to be told NOW- with the state of current youth violence we cannot stress the effect this play could have to help change it. To bring more people towards ACTION. Theatre is a dress rehearsal for life- we want people to walk away and think about ways to help stop youth violence. MacArthur's play is about a group of small town teenagers that struggle with feelings of boredom and rage in a place that gives very little hope of anything better to come for them.  Inspired by the murder of Reena Virk and the story of the Columbine shooters, Dylan and Eric, this play revolves around a group of youth that taunt, torture and eventually kill a young girl who ultimately is not too much different from themselves.  The group in question, four fourteen year old youths, both witness and participate in the violence upon their peer.  Although it was written more than a decade ago it still resonates with current problems today, such as bullying in high schools and senseless youth violence.  You need only think back the killing of Kimberly Proctor and Autumn Pasquale, and the beating of Florida cheerleader Victoria Lindsay, to realize that these can no longer be looked at as isolated incidents.  These acts of violence are symptoms of a greater problem in our society: President Obama at present is arguing to help legislate gun control in the United States. The past killing spree at Columbine and the murder of Reena Virk although memories, are relived in the wake of current violence.  Audiences need to grapple with these current issues, and staging this piece keeps this issue in the forefront of our minds.</span></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get: Breaking it Down</strong></p>
<p>We Need $4,000 to cover set materials, building, costumes, makeup, gore effects, and marketing such as posters, handbills, etc. </p>
<p><span>We have quite a few unique perks to offer you as a contributor to our campaign: a thank you in our program, a signed poster by the cast and team of girls!, a complimentary ticket to girls!, a personal video message from our team.</span></p>
<p><span>Even if we don't reach our entire fundraising goal- all money will go towards production costs for the play. Every penny truly counts!</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><strong>The Impact</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As stated above-we believe this production of girls!girls!girls! will contribute vitally to shining a light on teen violence as an issue that can no longer be ignored. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span>Not only will the impact of this production help raise awareness and action towards a very serious issue, but this production will also share the talents of a team of artists committed to creating politically and socially relevant theatre.

<p>In November of 2014, we produced our first production, <b><i>Songs for a New World </i></b>by Jason Robert Brown at Stage 773 in Chicago. We were so fortunate that our debut production had a <b>sold out run</b>, our cast and crew truly embodied teamwork and we had a great experience.  After the success of our first ever foray into producing in Chicago, we were in love with the process and the product, and knew we had to continue. <i><b>Songs for a New World </b></i>was 100% funded out of our own pockets and we were grateful to break even, but that’s not a business model that will work forever, so for this next venture we are asking for help!</p>

Hello!  Derik Iverson and Maggie Mitchell here!  We are the co-founders of Making Rain Productions, a new production company that keeps teamwork and respect for the artist at its core. 

                   
In November of 2014, we produced our first production, Songs for a New World by Jason Robert Brown at Stage 773 in Chicago. We were so fortunate that our debut production had a sold out run, our cast and crew truly embodied teamwork and we had a great experience.  After the success of our first ever foray into producing in Chicago, we were in love with the process and the product, and knew we had to continue. Songs for a New World was 100% funded out of our own pockets and we were grateful to break even, but that’s not a business model that will work forever, so for this next venture we are asking for help!




Our next production in July, 2015 will be Coronado by Dennis Lehane, the American author who also wrote Shutter Island, Mystic River, and Gone Baby Gone. Coronado is his only play and we are excited to bring it life, literally, as its rarely performed. As a production company, our goal is to support our crew, actors and the production itself, be debt free, and also generate funds to create a foundation for the company’s future.  Derik is directing this play as its one of his all-time favorites. And now that we’ve gotten our feet wet with our first show, he's excited to direct it in a way where we have a game plan, resources, and supporters.  


                                         





Our budget for Coronado is $5,000, which includes rights to the show, set, rental space, costumes, actor and crew stipends and other costs that we all forget about like printing programs, marketing and Starbucks. In addition to the show, we hope to gain funds to cover the cost of the company’s needs such as maintaining the  website, business legal fees and a few cases of PBR for the director.
From this show we hope to jump-start future projects and continue to anchor our mission that all efforts from all artists involved in a Making Rain Productions project will be supported financially and creatively, and empowering individuals through teamwork will remain the number one focal point as we grow and thrive. 
We want to thank the Cornservatory, home of Corn Productions for providing the perfect venue for Coronado and being a great start to awesome teamwork on this production. 


                                           
We’d also like to thank all of you, ahead of time, for donating your love, support and lunch money to Making Rain Productions. We’ve created a few, fun ways that you can donate and get stuff in return!


Why Coronado 

 As thrilling and as dark as Coronado can be, it is ultimately a story of hope. It's an examination of the desperate measures people take to live the life they want to lead. It brings the message that you are not the sum of your past; you are who you want to be. Coronado is a reminder that we are who we are because we choose to be, which we believe is an important message to share. The roles are beautiful and full of depth; a great opportunity for actors. From lighting to sound design, costuming and set, this show has a great script and inventive concept for all creative team members to bring their brilliance to the project and feel proud of what they have contributed and accomplished. Coronado offers a wonderful platform for everyone to ""dig in,"" and we think its important to bring scripts to life that provide an adequate canvas for everyone to play! We are confident in our team, and our hard work and values, our creative talent and vision to produce a deeply affecting and highly entertaining evening of theater!
About the Play

Coronado takes place in a seedy, honky-tonk bar and tells the story of desperate people who have more in common than meets the eye. Lovers Gina and Will plot the murder of Gina's loser-of-a husband, a Doctor and a Patient begin an illicit affair and cross professional boundaries, and Bobby and his Father attempt to piece together the location of a precious diamond and a missing girlfriend. 
These intersecting plot lines illustrate stories of bloody desires that shatter lives and unknowingly change everyone's future. Dennis Lehane's dark rabbit hole of a thriller will have you on the edge of your seat as you piece together secrets, lies, and violent crimes before arriving to a harrowing conclusion you'll never see coming. Coronado is the chilling, cinematic noir you've been waiting to witness on stage.

Other Ways You Can Help 
 We understand if money is a little tight. But you can still help!:  Let us know if you want to volunteer to be an usher and see the show for free! Shoot us an email if you want to help backstage! 
We hope you feel good about supporting local theater, and also getting your tickets to the show early! There are so many options and we are so grateful and excited to put this show on its feet! You’re gonna love it. 
Thank you for helping us MAKE SOME RAIN!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Created in 2001, the Recognizing Women Project is an annual six month interdisciplinary research and performance initiative led by nathantrice/RITUALS dance theater in collaboration with adolescent and young adult female dancers, and university students enrolled in the humanities and social sciences. The goal of our collaboration is to develop a holistic understanding of women’s unique experiences and contributions, and to create dance theater that reflects those understandings.  This year, the RWP research initiative is developing a new dance entitled <i>""I the object in my eye""</i> that investigates adolescent and young adult female self-objectification in America. With a team of students from Barnard College and Columbia University's women and gender studies and sociology departments, our collaborative aim is to identify the societal, interpersonal, and personal contributions that play a role in female self-objectification.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As we near the end of our six-month creative process, there are several unmet needs that threaten the full execution of the project. Currently, we are in need of additional managerial, research and artists rehearsal salaries in the amount of $15,000.00. We are asking for your support by making a donation today of any size to help us meet our goal and completely realize the RWP research initiative. Your contributions create significant momentum towards the completion of this unique and timely project. </p>
<p>Besides helping us use art as a platform to bring awareness and provoke activism around women’s concerns, we have a list of perks available to those who support the Recognizing Women Project, from a signed poster, to complimentary performance tickets, to an inside look at our creative process. We want you to be involved in the company and the conversations we are having!</p>
<p>nathantrice/RITUALS is a sponsored artist underneath Performance Zone Inc. (dba The Field), a not-for-profit, tax exempt, 501(c)(3) organization serving the performing arts community, and <i>your donation to the company and to the Recognizing Women Project is tax-deductible</i>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>From the beginning of this season of the RWP, the company, research team, high school &amp; young adult dancers have rigorously engaged in weekly personal story telling and self-inquiry to better understand themselves. The opportunity for each person to revisit their stories has allowed each person to develop a deeper understanding and critical lens into how and why their life situations govern their identity, and how they make choices to best navigate their situations. This brought up the question: is identity situational?  As we explored this inquiry, new perspectives and insights emerged, affording everyone with new language around the fluidity of identity as it pertains to ones situation, and the understanding and importance of self-awareness, self-agency and self-accountability.</p>
<p>These kinds of artistic educational processes are the heart &amp; soul of the RWP and <i>cannot </i>happen without your support. Help us bring this project into the next year.  Your donations are the foundation of the Recognizing Women Project's annual commitment to raising awareness around women's experiences and contributions.</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The Recognizing Women Project is about having ongoing conversations about the social, cultural, and political structures that impact women.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What is BRTW?</h3>
<p>Black Revolutionary Theatre Workshop is an independent group of NYC-based Black artists seeking to explore, craft, produce, and perform Black experiences and responses to systemic oppression. Founded shortly after the massacre at Mother Emanuel AME, BRTW places a premium on ensuring that Black voices are not silenced and that Black identities are not lost in stereotypes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479086539/oy7tbzl3uw0txrz1tqqj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As the Black community grapples with the injustices it faces from without and the privileges from within, BRTW seeks to create a space to critically engage with the layers of intersectional identity and justice while constantly asking, “What does true liberation look like?”</p>
<p>Our last production, <i>Revolution, </i>toured to colleges in Connecticut and Vermont, and wove together various narratives of a 20th century race war.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Being an artist in New York is hard, and it's especially hard when you're a group of overworked, underpaid twenty-somethings. Our goal is to raise $5,000 in 30 days. This may seem like a lot, but compare this to the average production cost of one Off-Off Broadway show-$18,000-and you'll find that it's actually quite tiny.*</p>
<p>But what do we need it for? Here's where the money goes:</p>

<li>Securing LLC status</li>
<li>Fractured Atlas (fiscal sponsorship) fees</li>

<li>Props and Costumes</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
<li>Coffee!!! (only half kidding)</li>
</ul>
<p>As of right now we're paying for all of this up-front. We repay ourselves with money from commissions and touring projects, but launching a production is expensive and drains not only our company account but our own pockets.</p>

<p>In the face of major shifts in the zeitgeist, freedom of speech and protest become all the more valuable.

</div></div>","(Texto en español debajo)ANDERPLATZ brings together 9 collaborators from Spain, Argentina, Germany, Italy, Austria and the USA for their first theatre-dance show: DETACHED. 

Our goal is to have the premiere in November 2016 in the Dock 11 Theater, Berlin, Germany.

We are a Berlin-based collective of ten professionals from dance, theatre and music, performing and directing with companies such as Familie Flöz, Blue Man Group,  and Faizal Zeghoudi.

The money we hope to raise with this campaign is the minimum required to carry out a project of this scale and will allow us to concentrate our efforts in the final period leading to the premiere in November 2016. 

Ad Libitum ad InfinitumDETACHED is our first piece, but it shouldn‘t be our last! ANDERPLATZ is aiming to establish itself as a company in contemporary theater. Your contribution to this premiere may give us the push we need to get things rolling. We aren‘t only driven by short-term success, but also by long-term evolution!The Piece

DETACHED is clever, brutal and funny, and at the same time, very vulnerable.

The CollectiveWhen we started meeting to improvise and develop material for this piece two years ago, we had expected that exciting things might happen. But we were utterly overwhelmed by the powerful alchemy that was created in this special combination of performers from various disciplines and different cultural backgrounds.
 In our work, the concept of the dancer, actor and musician gradually melt together. We are in search of a visual and physical theatre: a vivid mix of concrete and abstract scenes. The body, the soul, music, space and language are the performers’ tools.

</span></p><p>Тhe 2015 Same Sex
Ballroom Dancing Championship is not only a dance competition, but also a
public declaration of the need for equality at all levels of our lives. It
supports the diversity and acceptance of the youth and adult LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>The 2015 US Same Sex Ballroom Dance Championship
is a two-day show and competition, outlining the grace and skills of the
ballroom dance contestants accompanied with intervals of social ballroom
dancing, games with the audience and professional dance performances. </p>
<p>Welcomed
speech at the Opening Ceremony will be from State Representative  Sarah Peake.</p>
<p>Doors opening at 5:30pm with VIP Champaign time.
Competition starts at 6pm with preliminary rounds. After awarding the winners
and 2015 US Champions we will have social dance and ballroom dance party.</p>
<p>The featuring are disciplines like Argentine
Tango, Salsa, Hustle, Country Western Polka, Two Step and West Coast Swing as
well as the traditional Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot, Cha-cha Rumba, Jive  and more…(full
list you can find in the website). The competition will proceed by the rules of
the dancesport organization governing such ballroom dance competitions- North
American Same Sex Partner Dance Association (NASSPDA). </p>
<p>The Championship is the only same-sex ballroom
dance contest in New England. After its 
two annual events in 2013  and
2014 NASSPDA Executive Board had awarded us the privilege to host the 2015 US
Championship. </p>
<p>This event will benefit the general population-
18 years old and above; man, woman and transgender. It is open to everybody
especially supporting the LGBTQ community. One of the main goals is to
introduce ballroom dancing as an outlet, a safe environment and an alternative
pro-social event for the young LGBTQ. Such event is teaching them about
partnership, understanding, tolerance, and responsibility not only on the dance
floor but in life.</p>
<p>We are expecting 100 competitors from Montreal,
Toronto and Vancouver Canada, New York, Connecticut, Rode Island,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Philadelphia, Florida, Maryland,
Washington DC, California and many other states. The venue can host 300
spectators and most of them will be from Greater Boston and New England as well
as friends and supporters of the competitive couples.</p>
<p>The dance competition is a yearly event that
embraces equality and acceptance among the mainstream and LGBTQ communities
through one form of artistic performance - artistic and competitive same-sex
ballroom dancing.</p>

In December 2012, he organized a fundraiser at Club Purgatory in Provincetown, MA, raising more than $2,000 to support the It Gets Better Project, an anti-bullying initiative. He and his previous dance partner created a YouTube video about how ballroom dancing helped them to take a stand against gay bullying. The first Boston same-sex dance competition, held last year,  was a major success due to Kalin's organization of the event,  the convenience of Boston’s outstanding location and, most importantly, the inclusion of everyone, ranging in age from young college students to adult LGBT dancers. </p><p>Most recently he was part of the adjudicators panel of the DanceSport event during the Gay Games 9 in Cleveland, making this competition an unforgettable life time experience.  </p><br/></div>","Hello, My name is Kalin Mitov and I am the director of this event.

Doors opening at 5:30pm with VIP Champaign time.
Competition starts at 6pm with preliminary rounds. After awarding the winners
and 2015 US Champions we will have social dance and ballroom dance party.
The featuring are disciplines like Argentine
Tango, Salsa, Hustle, Country Western Polka, Two Step and West Coast Swing as
well as the traditional Waltz, Tango, Foxtrot, Cha-cha Rumba, Jive  and more…(full
list you can find in the website). The competition will proceed by the rules of
the dancesport organization governing such ballroom dance competitions- North
American Same Sex Partner Dance Association (NASSPDA). 
The Championship is the only same-sex ballroom
dance contest in New England. After its 
two annual events in 2013  and
2014 NASSPDA Executive Board had awarded us the privilege to host the 2015 US
Championship. 
This event will benefit the general population-
18 years old and above; man, woman and transgender. It is open to everybody
especially supporting the LGBTQ community. One of the main goals is to
introduce ballroom dancing as an outlet, a safe environment and an alternative
pro-social event for the young LGBTQ. Such event is teaching them about
partnership, understanding, tolerance, and responsibility not only on the dance
floor but in life.
We are expecting 100 competitors from Montreal,
Toronto and Vancouver Canada, New York, Connecticut, Rode Island,
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine, Philadelphia, Florida, Maryland,
Washington DC, California and many other states. The venue can host 300
spectators and most of them will be from Greater Boston and New England as well
as friends and supporters of the competitive couples.
The dance competition is a yearly event that
embraces equality and acceptance among the mainstream and LGBTQ communities
through one form of artistic performance - artistic and competitive same-sex
ballroom dancing.

Тhe Championship is not only a ballroom dance competition, but also a public declaration of the need for equality at all levels of our lives. It supports the diversity and acceptance of the youth and adult LGBTQ community.Event Organizing Committee:Kalin Mitov - DirectorTedi Eaton - Community Relations CoordinatorNordis Glasoe - Accounting and RegistrationLinda Toomey - On Deck Captain and DesignDon Jaffee, MD - Fundraising and Technical SupportThe primary costs are associated with the venue including associated lighting and audio visual equipment. But there is also a need to make people aware of the event, to attract attendees and competitors, and the advertising necessary to reach those audiences is quite costly.Our revenue has not allowed us to compensate our judges at  market rates and we have not been able to reward the winners financially, as other competitions of this type do.We lack the large sponsorships that allow the traditional dance events to survive and continue year to year, so we are looking to you to help us  perpetuate this new tradition for the LGBT community.If we are not able to cover our costs, as was the case last year - our first year of this competition - we will not be able to repeat this valuable  opportunity for the LGBT community in the years to come, thus eliminating a rare opportunity for the LGBT community to express themselves creatively.We are, therefore,  trying to raise $5,500 to cover the baseline costs, and if donations allow, recognize the winners with a financial reward and expand the advertising budget to reach more audiences. About the Director, Kalin Mitov: Kalin is not new to the same-sex ballroom dance scene, having won both US and North American Same-Sex Champion titles for the last 3 years, as well as being the European Same-Sex Champion Bronze Medalist. In December 2012, he organized a fundraiser at Club Purgatory in Provincetown, MA, raising more than $2,000 to support the It Gets Better Project, an anti-bullying initiative. He and his previous dance partner created a YouTube video about how ballroom dancing helped them to take a stand against gay bullying. The first Boston same-sex dance competition, held last year,  was a major success due to Kalin's organization of the event,  the convenience of Boston’s outstanding location and, most importantly, the inclusion of everyone, ranging in age from young college students to adult LGBT dancers. Most recently he was part of the adjudicators panel of the DanceSport event during the Gay Games 9 in Cleveland, making this competition an unforgettable life time experience.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

in Philly who may not be able to travel. Past instructors have included Roxane Butterfly, Karen Callaway Williams, Andrew Nemr, Sarah Mason, and Dolores Sanchez. We are in communication with several of today's hottest tappers in hopes of creating a series with multiple instructors annually that would allow students to pre-register for the entire series at a discount. We also plan to begin a week-long summer intensive for kids and teens to continue their training in a professional environment when their dance studios take a break. Ticket sales 
only cover a portion of our production costs, so we rely on individual 
donors like you to keep raising the profile of rhythm tap in 
Philadelphia. Your tax-deductible donation will be used to:
continue the projects outlined above
cover rehearsal space fees and costumes
bring in guest artists for performances and educational opportunities
choreographer and dancer fees
scholarships for students to attend master classes and participate in our youth company

</h3> <span> </span><span>This spring, I wrote and performed my first ever solo show entitled <i>Slant</i> in the <a href=""http://cola.siu.edu/communicationstudies/kleinau/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marion Kleinau Theatre</a> at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, under the direction of Craig Gingrich Philbrook. Emily Dickinson’s famous line, “<a href=""http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/247292"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tell all the truth but tell it slant</a>--” inspires this 60 minute performance that explores the risky endeavor of 
telling stories, true stories. <i>Slant</i> asks what can be seen from the 
slant of falling, of failing, and of “risking ourselves precisely at 
moments of unknowingness” (<a href=""http://fordhampress.com/index.php/giving-an-account-of-onesef-paperback.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Judith Butler</a>). Drawing from performance

</h3>I've always loved traveling and performing, but doing both at the same time? Never have I ever. So imagine my delight when I was invited to perform <i>Slant </i>at the Critical Autoethnography Conference at <a href=""http://www.monash.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Monash University</a> in Melbourne, Australia. This opportunity to share my first solo show with this talented group of international artists and scholars and get their critical/creative feedback seems too good to miss.

</div></div>","The Show: Slant
  This spring, I wrote and performed my first ever solo show entitled Slant in the Marion Kleinau Theatre at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale, under the direction of Craig Gingrich Philbrook. Emily Dickinson’s famous line, “Tell all the truth but tell it slant--” inspires this 60 minute performance that explores the risky endeavor of 
telling stories, true stories. Slant asks what can be seen from the 
slant of falling, of failing, and of “risking ourselves precisely at 
moments of unknowingness” (Judith Butler). Drawing from performance 
Artist Bas Jan Ader and writers like Joan Didion, and Jack Halberstam, this solo performance is a bricolage of stories, poetry, 
and images about falling down, falling from grace, and falling in 
______.
   The Dream: Australia
I've always loved traveling and performing, but doing both at the same time? Never have I ever. So imagine my delight when I was invited to perform Slant at the Critical Autoethnography Conference at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. This opportunity to share my first solo show with this talented group of international artists and scholars and get their critical/creative feedback seems too good to miss. So, I've got a theatre, I've got an audience, and I've got a place to stay. I've just got to get to Australia and feed myself for 10 days. That's where I hope you come in.

<p>My name is Troy Couillard. I am an emerging theatre professional
passionate about the future of theatre in this city. We are absolutely
overflowing with brand new talent, eager and excited to get their work out in
front of the eyes of the citizens. I have assembled twenty acts ranging from
plays to dance pieces, poetry, social experiments, comedians, musicians and
even an installation to showcase just what these artists have to offer. The
festival will happen from July 22nd to August 2nd in the Motel in the Epcor
Centre for the Performing Arts. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>What I need to make this work as smoothly as possible I need $3,000
dollars. This will be money used towards: rehearsal space, props, costumes and
a small honorarium for the artists. Now ANY amount will be helpful and able to
make this festival an enjoyable and successful experience. Additionally, extra
funds will be used to fund next year's theatre season from Search Tower
Company. </p>
<p>Now, for your help there are perks. Perhaps free tickets might tickle
your fancy. Nope? Your name in the program, maybe? Extra entries into prize
draws free of charge?  Well, if that doesn't float your boat, how about
the chance to hop up on stage and introduce a night of performances? Any of
these things are up for grabs. All it takes is a donation!!!!!</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>This project is important because the world is slowly becoming digital,
not that there is anything wrong with that. But these musicians, writers,
directors and artists still have a strong, fierce beating heart and because of
their strength and bravery to put their work out into the world, they deserve
their day in the sun. With your help, their day in the sun could let to
magnificent opportunities for them in the future. </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Now, there is more ways to help than just money! By spreading the word

<p>And that was when we met. Three Hungarians in London, three strong-headed independent women working their way through loneliness, despair and the shame of having to restart from zero. Together we became a team and decided to laugh fate in its face. </p>

<p>Have
you ever felt being a stranger? Being put in a box you struggle to escape? Did you ever had the feeling that the big city just swallows you

Using the lightness of cabaret, it talks about the fight for survival 
from the viewpoint of a 50-something female artist trying to rebuild her
 life in London. Marlene’s journey is happening here and

In fact, we've already put a lot of work, thought, and well, hard-earned money into pushing MARLENE's lovely behind on stage.

'Dar Winners' by BodyScape

BodyScape is a collective of four artists together: Virág Arany, Júlia Hadi, Stephane Kozik, Damien Pairon. 
https://www.facebook.com/pages/BodyScape/1642022302704300?fref=ts
Virág and Júlia are dancers and choreographers from Hungary, Stephane is a sound artist, Damien a video artist, both coming from Belgium. 
We met at a residency in 2012, Hungary. Soon after we decided to work together, since we all shared interests in creating live multimedia performances, searching for new perspectives in multidisciplinary art. 
You can have an insight to our previous works on the links below:
http://stephanekozik.be/http://damienpairon.com/
http://bodylotioncodance.com/
Dar Winners is the title of the performance we are working on at the moment. We started researching in 2013 but due to distance and lack of finances we had to make a pause in 2014. This year, we got the chance to continue our collaboration, three residencies and a premier date at Trafó House of Contemporary Arts in Budapest. This is a wonderful opportunity for us to present our project to the public, but we still need some support to cover our expenses.
By contributing to our campaign you make it possible to finalise a two-year long creation process and support an independent, young, democratic collective, in which artists and art-forms share an equal role in creation, organization, management and finances. We strongly believe in this way of working and would like to share the outcome with as many people as possible!
Special thanks to: 
Zsolt Végh and Etrange Prod for makinfg our campaign video!






What We Need 



FEED THE ARTISTS  
We still miss meals for 10 days for our four 
team members. You can contribute by 25 EUR covering the catering of one 
artist/day. 


BRING US TOGETHER  Damien and Stephane are coming to Budapest by
 car, so that they can bring all the technical equipment needed for our 
show. We miss 700 EUR for the petrol plus highway tolls for their 2880 
km long journey. Each 10 euros cover 33 km!



DRESS THE ARTISTS Since we are all four on stage, we need 100 euros each to have suitable costumes.

MORE MAGIC We still need to buy some special sensors and led lights to 
create a unique atmosphere. In total they cost 500 euros.

CAPTURE THE MOMENTS
 In order to ensure a sustainable future for
 the performance we need to make professional documentation about it and
 edit a teaser, an artistic trailer and a full-length version of the 
piece. The fees of 3 cameramen for four days plus the editing of three 
videos cost 1400 euros altogether.


REWARD OUR VOLUNTEERS 
We are so lucky that we have a lot of 
people helping us in the creation process: two people working on the 
management, two people writing texts and mentoring the project. We would
 really like to give something in return, 250 euros/person would be 
great to appreciate their efforts.

What You Get
Support us by: 

10 EUR - we thank you for supporting us by adding your name to
 the list of sponsors in our full-length production video and 
communication surfaces

<p>Hello, I'm Kat and I'm a belly dancer and horror-nut. Ever since I was young, I would force my friends to watch cheesy 50s horror films and would cover my walls and notebooks with Evil Dead, Vincent Price, and Creature from the Black Lagoon. Normal teenage girl stuff. Later in life, I discovered belly dance and soon started putting on shows. Beginning with Fables, a fairy tale themed show, we rented our own space and asked local performers to participate. It was a success. We decided to continue with different themes each time. Next came 8 Bit: A Video Game themed show, and Antonio's Animal Rescue Benefit Show. In 2015, our themed show series took a turn when we decided to take on Horror Films. The first show was a huge success, selling out even our extra seats. The next year grew twice in size and was clear that our audience still wanted more. </p>
<p>We are asking for your help. The show has grown and needs to expand to a larger venue. We have chosen to work with the Tacoma Broadway Center and negotiations have already begun. The space itself holds over 700, has a huge stage, trained staff, and professional lighting. We are thrilled to hopefully call this venue our new permanent home. </p>
<p>With your patronage, our show can get a head start with rental deposit, costuming, rehearsal, and props. </p>

<li><p>If we do not reach our goal any money will go directly to rental costs.</p></li>
</ul></div><div>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>Horrific is a fun experience that's meant to make you laugh, scream, and cheer. We want to spread that fun for the macabre to others. Seeing as this show has been a huge success in the past we looking forward to becoming better and better every year. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Room 29 Theatre are proud to be presenting 'It Shoulda Been You' the Broadway musical comedy at the Edinburgh Fringe this summer and we need your help to make it the best possible show it can be! </p>
<p>We are new Scottish based theatre company and excited to present the fringe premiere of this wonderful show.  To make sure we can deliver the highest standard of production we are hoping to raise funds to support our wonderful cast and crew putting on this show.  The money raised from this campaign will go directly to the lavish wedding costumes, set and marketing/PR materials. </p>
<p>You as a contributor will be helping a new theatre group put on a hilarious show to a new audience.  As a thank you for contributing, we are offering rewards such as tickets to the show, seat reservation privileges, video thank you messages and show t-shirts. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need £1000 to support our production costs this year. Staging any sort of production poses a lot of financial challenges, and particularly those in the Edinburgh Fringe.  We have got this far through traditional fundraising (such as concerts, ceilidhs and pub quizzes) but we need this extra boost to help us hit our target.  </p>
<p>The money raised will go directly to the following things: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Costumes</strong> - this show is set in a modern-day wedding, and just like a real wedding these outfits don’t come cheap!  Our costume designer is finding cost effective ways to create these costumes and we have budgeted £300 to this. </li>
<li>
<strong>Set</strong> - as a fringe production the set is very minimal but we will be creating our own mirrors and moving chairs that will also need to be collapsible to keep in the small storage space available - £200</li>
<li>
<strong>Props</strong> - we require some very specific props including a bridal bouquet, countless fake bottles of bubbly, and even a panni maker - £100</li>
<li>
<strong>Company insurance</strong> - this is something we must pay for to ensure our actors, crew and band are covered in case we have any accidents - £200</li>
<li>
<strong>PR costs</strong> - we have a lot of publicity planned and have created a flyer and posters that we would like to distribute throughout Edinburgh and every day of the run on the Royal Mile. We already have slots ready on the royal mile stages where we will be previewing some of songs to the passers-by - £200</li>
</ul>
<p>If we can raise our target of £1000 this will go a long way and provide a lot of support for a fresh, new theatre company that is taking on the mammoth task of taking a show to the Edinburgh Fringe. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact will be great on those taking part in It Shoulda Been You and for the audience that will see this show.  Our campaign goal is relatively small compared to our overall budget, however as outlined above with careful planning this can go a long way to give our production that extra bit of wow factor to help us stand out in the every busy Fringe programme.</p>
<p>Room 29 Theatre might be a new company but as individuals we have plenty of experience. As a producer, James Leggat achieved success when he led Dundee Uni's musical theatre society to a success with the The Addams Family.  That year the society also achieved most progressive society for our hard work turning the group around. </p>
<p>Our director, Neil Lavin, directed the five-star European premiere of Heathers: The Musical and has had a wealth of experience working on productions all across Scotland, and even in Virginia Beach, USA with Tidewater Stage.</p>
<p>Room 29 are very excited to also have Steven Segaud and Nel Springrose as a part of the team.  Steven's musical director credits include EUSOG's Little Shop of Horrors and Edinburgh Uni's Footlights version of Urinetown.  Nel Springrose our choreographer has worked with G&amp;T productions was also the choreographer for Edinburgh Footlight's Rent.  </p>
<p>We have an excellent team of people with plenty of theatre experience and we are all excited to be working together for the first time on this fantastic show with a wonderful, talented cast. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every show, especially those in the Fringe, has an element of financial risk to it.  The Fringe environment is very competitive with hundreds of shows to see.  To break even, we need to sell a certain number of tickets.  </p>
<p>We are very confident that we can achieve this because of our experience and our strict and well prepared budget.  Furthermore, although we are a new theatre group with no reputation we do however have an experienced cast and creative from from all over the UK, with our company coming together from Dundee, Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Glasgow, London and Plymouth.  We are certainly excited to bring together this great mix of performers from different backgrounds together to take part in the biggest arts festival in the world, on its 70th anniversary.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While our primary goal is fundraising, you can also show your support by buying tickets to our show, and spreading the word to all of your family and friends! We run from the 12<sup>th</sup> – 19<sup>th</sup> of August at 20:15 in Venue 45.</p>

<p>Our setting is the New York cityscape. As each of these dances unfold, the lives of the artist's connect and intertwine. The audience gets to see how the artists' choices not only affect others but the whole patchwork that is our art and our society.</p>

</div></div>","ON POINT DANCE IN COLLABORATION WITH UNREEL FILMS & YOU 
                                        are creating an eight part dance series.

 STRIVING
We believe the choices made in the ebb and flow of everyday life affect the artist on a personal level; thus the voice they strive to share.
We are capturing the journey of artists as they strive to create; and we are telling that story through dance. 
Our setting is the New York cityscape. As each of these dances unfold, the lives of the artist's connect and intertwine. The audience gets to see how the artists' choices not only affect others but the whole patchwork that is our art and our society.
 When the effect of life's shifting circumstances are forged with passion, creativity, and imagination... The result is captivating visceral artistry. Let's nurture the artist's voice and encourage collaboration from the ground up. Lets create something meaningful and beautiful together! 
Join the movement!

New things are on the horizon for season 11 and we invite you to be a part of it!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477347277/hqb9drxzcf9adm2pburr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>This year, BRD will be presenting 7 exciting works of dance at the Firehouse Performing Arts Center, for students at Western Washington University, and for Seattle audiences down south. This show is more elaborate than we're used to and requires special props like lounge chairs, fancy socks, and a glamorous tailor-made dress, in addition to all of our usual overhead expenses.</p><div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>We hope to raise $2,750 for the project. Your contribution will go directly towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Props and costuming expenses</li>
<li>Choreographer fees</li>
<li>Rehearsal space expenses</li>
<li>Promotional costs</li>
<li>Performance venue and technical support</li>
</ul>
<div>BRD is run entirely on a volunteer basis. No one is paid for the hundreds of hours of rehearsal, performance, teaching, and administrative work that we do for the company. When we reach our goal for this campaign, we hope to offer partial stipends to each dancer for performance time. Our purpose is not to make money, but to do what we love and bring dance into people's lives. We hope to make BRD as sustainable as possible so we can continue this mission!</div>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477347496/rzclzttrb5p0cm7l5s1v.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>In Bellingham. </strong>Since we are focusing on one show this season, we will have time and energy to bring it to its full performance potential! The work will premiere for local audiences at the <a href=""http://www.appleseedmac.com/firehouse/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Firehouse Performing Arts Center</a> on January 20-21 and 27-29. BRD will also feature select works from this show for elementary school students at the Children's Educational Matinee on February 17, to show these young students the varieties and possibilities of contemporary dance. On February 18, BRD will share the stage with the Seattle-based group, AU Dance Collective, in a split-bill performance at <a href=""https://cfpa.wwu.edu/theatredance"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Western Washington University</a> to add even more diversity to the show and expand the dance experiences of our Bellingham audiences.</p>

</div></div>","The ProjectFounded in 2005, Bellingham Repertory Dance (BRD) is a nonprofit collective of dancers in Bellingham, WA. New things are on the horizon for season 11 and we invite you to be a part of it!This year, BRD will be presenting 7 exciting works of dance at the Firehouse Performing Arts Center, for students at Western Washington University, and for Seattle audiences down south. This show is more elaborate than we're used to and requires special props like lounge chairs, fancy socks, and a glamorous tailor-made dress, in addition to all of our usual overhead expenses.
The Goal
We hope to raise $2,750 for the project. Your contribution will go directly towards:

Props and costuming expenses
Choreographer fees
Rehearsal space expenses
Promotional costs
Performance venue and technical support

BRD is run entirely on a volunteer basis. No one is paid for the hundreds of hours of rehearsal, performance, teaching, and administrative work that we do for the company. When we reach our goal for this campaign, we hope to offer partial stipends to each dancer for performance time. Our purpose is not to make money, but to do what we love and bring dance into people's lives. We hope to make BRD as sustainable as possible so we can continue this mission!

The Impact
In Bellingham. Since we are focusing on one show this season, we will have time and energy to bring it to its full performance potential! The work will premiere for local audiences at the Firehouse Performing Arts Center on January 20-21 and 27-29. BRD will also feature select works from this show for elementary school students at the Children's Educational Matinee on February 17, to show these young students the varieties and possibilities of contemporary dance. On February 18, BRD will share the stage with the Seattle-based group, AU Dance Collective, in a split-bill performance at Western Washington University to add even more diversity to the show and expand the dance experiences of our Bellingham audiences.
And beyond. Season 11 also has a touring component to it. Following our Bellingham presentations of this show, BRD will hit the road in the spring of 2017. Last year, BRD sold out two performances at Velocity Dance Center in Seattle and we reached 200 new audience members this way; many of which had likely never seen dance out of Bellingham before. We hope to achieve this and more this season, but we can’t do it alone.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Breathe for those who can not.</p>
<p>Drawing on our experience as theatre practitioners, healers, and movers we are compelled to help the survivors of this tragedy. We believe that theatre is inherently healing and therapeautic. We hold grief in the body even when we don't know it. We are creating a workshop that allows pariticipants to explore, create, and connect with other members of the community through contemporary theatre practices, yoga, and meditation.</p>

<h3><strong>Our Tenth Season</strong></h3>
<p>Hudson Warehouse was founded nine years ago with the mission of providing free classical theater to all.  We are an outdoor theater company, located in Riverside Park in the heart of The Upper Westside of New York City, along the Hudson River.   Audiences rave that experiencing our theater productions, against the backdrop of the setting sun along the Hudson River, is a thrilling and unique experience.  And it’s all for FREE.</p>
<p>""We congratulate Hudson Warehouse on their 10th year presenting Classics to the public in Riverside Park. We are thrilled that they have made their home with us and hope they will continue to enchant Riverside Park's neighbors and all other guests with their theatrical mettle for years to come.""</p>
<p>-- Zhen Heinemann, Director of Public Programming, Riverside Park, New York City Parks Department, February 14, 2013</p>
<h3>Who are We?</h3>
<p>We started out presenting one show over two weekends. <br/>Now we produce a three show season that spans the entire Summer.</p>
<p><strong>Over The Past 9 Years We’ve Grown Enormously.</strong></p>
<p>We now have both the ‘Shakespeare in the Bar’ and the ‘Writers-a-Go-Go’ reading series.  Our outreach includes colleges, youth organizations as well as our own ‘Hudson Warehouse Shakespeare Workout’ which is held three Saturdays during the Summer season. </p>
<p><strong>A Two Show Winter Season is Upon Us.</strong></p>
<p>We have grown from one production a summer to a three show season that spans the entire summer and this winter I’m excited to announce that we will be moving indoors. We will be producing a show at the Bernie Wohl Center here in NYC this November for a three week run . We will follow that up with another production to be produced in March of 2014, thereby extending our season all year around. </p>
<p><strong>Our 10</strong><strong><sup>th</sup></strong><strong> Year! </strong></p>
<p>This year your donations go towards our Summer Season in Riverside Park, our Education and Outreach and our First Full Season Indoors.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We have spent Nine Years bringing Free classical theater to the public on the North Patio of the Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument.  We have attracted people from as far away as New Zealand and Taiwan. Rotterdam and London. We are part of the fabric of the Upper West Side, part of New York City, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">part</span> of people's lives. People who are from all over the world, people who just find us.  People who look for us.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Though we are a non-for-profit corporation we have continued to exist by public donations, not by corpoate grants.  We have stayed ""grass roots"" in order not to lose touch with our basic belief: that theater is an esential part of being human. So we look to our family, our friends, the Warehouse company members and our loyal audience, for it’s their donations that allow us to continue to exist and to grow.</p>

<p>The Walltown Children’s Theatre in Durham, North Carolina is embarking on another GREAT production and we need your help!</p>
<p>We are in the early stages of producing <em>Indigo Blue,</em> a play that was written especially for our theatre by local award-winning playwright, Howard Craft. In order to bring this beautiful creation to life, we’re asking you to make a contribution. Our goal is to raise $5,000 to help pay for production costs like set design, costumes, and an original music score. As a small non-profit organization, we simply cannot produce this play without your help.</p>
<p><em>Indigo Blue</em> is not your typical children's play. Audiences will be riveted by Howard Craft's unique and inspiring adaptation of the classic tale of the Pied Piper. When you contribute to <em>Indigo Blue</em> you are supporting both underserved youth in our community <strong>as well as </strong>local artists and original local theater.</p>
<p>At Walltown Children's Theatre we believe it is important to give children the opportunity to perform in a professional atmosphere. By doing so, we communicate the seriousness of our investment in their talent. Again, and again, we have seen Durham youth rise to the expectations we set for them. This is why it is important to stage this production in an excellent venue with professional support staff.</p>
<p>Give what you can -- we’re grateful for any amount to help us reach this goal!</p>
<p><strong>More about Walltown Children's Theatre</strong></p>
<p>Walltown Children’s Theatre is a non-profit that inspires positive social change by developing and reconnecting diverse, under-served youth in Walltown and the surrounding communities through exemplary performing arts programming, after-school academic tutoring and collaborative leadership opportunities. We opened our doors more than 10 years ago with a mission to bring the arts into the lives of children of all racial backgrounds, regardless of their ability to pay.

<p><strong>More about <em>Indigo Blue</em>, by Howard Craft</strong></p>
<p>This adaptation/interpretation of the classic fairy tale takes place in the multi-cultural mythical city of Milele Baada Ya. It follows the journey of ten-year-old Mariposa as she struggles to find and free her younger brother who has, along with the other children of Milele Baada Ya, been kidnapped by Maestro Marvin The Magnifico, aka the Pied Piper. To aid her on her journey she enlists the help of Lavern the gossiping lamp post, Tarik the talking cookie turned professional wrestler and the incomparable genius, Floyd, a platinum turtle. Music, song, and dance are used to guide the audience through this magical land. Staying true to the lessons of the Pied Piper, the importance of integrity and the consequences of lying, this updated version goes a step further and teaches that even when one is confronted with situations or obstacles that seem insurmountable, with a strong belief in self and the support of like minds, even the impossible becomes possible. Find out more about Howard Craft's work at <a href=""http://about.me/howardcraft"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://about.me/howardcraft</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Where your money goes</strong></p>
<p>Our total budget for the production is $15,000. We expect about third of these costs to be met by ticket sales. Another third will be raised through grants and commercial sponsorship. For the final $5,000, we are turning to you, our community! When you see <em>Indigo Blue</em> on the stage and experience the magic of live performance, you will be proud to know that you had a hand in opening the curtain for Durham’s young artists.</p>

<h3>See What I Hear</h3>
<p>The Murphy/Smith Dance Collective [MSDC] was founded in January of 2011 by Pittsburgh based choreographers Jamie Erin Murphy and Renee Danielle Smith. After establishing themselves as independent emerging choreographers they joined together to form the Murphy/Smith Dance Collective. They have performed in several venues including the Kelly-Strayhorn Theater, New Hazlett Theater, the Grey Box Theater, The Union Project, Dance Alloy and John Ryan Theater.</p>
<p>Murphy/Smith Dance Collective's premier of <b>See What I Hear</b> explores the relationship between sound and human instinct.  In our everyday life the sounds around us create an environment, a source of communication and even our general feeling of safety. What can happen when our famiiliar soundscape becomes distorted or even disappears? MSDC investigates how sound, or lack of sound, affects our way of life and communication. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Funding for this project will include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Artist Fees For Dancers, Composers, Set Designer, And Light Designer</li>

<li>Costumes For Seven Dancers And Costume Design</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fund MSDC Because:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They are an integral part of the Pittsburgh Dance Community</li>
<li>They are a project based dance company contingent upon sponsoring and fundraising</li>
<li>They are young artists with fresh perspective and have ideas larger than their bank accounts!</li>
<li>They are really nice</li>
<li>If they do not receive all of the required funding, they will present the show on a smaller scale. No funds will be wasted.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project began as a performance piece created to explore how individual lives are affected with the loss of sound.  The piece has developed from being specifically about hearing loss to how sound and lack of sound directly affect people in groups and in isolation.<strong> See What I Hear </strong>uses an intricate set, projection, and an original score to build environments and soundscapes to transport the audience into a sound filled world of grace and distortion. The dancers work through audio and physical boundaries through desolation, stillness, a range of vocal volumes, and matching movement to sound memories.</p>
<p>Murphy and Smith are extremely grateful for the generosity their company has received through fundraising campaigns and recognize that this project would not be possible without all of your support. </p>

Attraverso il suo utilizzo è possibile fare incontrare su un terreno comune culture differenti, ribaltare gli stereotipi e stimolare l'autoironia sia di chi osserva sia di chi lo pratica.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>OBIETTIVI</strong></p><ul>
<li>Costruire attraverso laboratori di umorismo occasioni di crescita e benessere per le popolazioni immigrate, oltre che opportunità professionali e di autostima per chi vuole far parte di una compagnia di teatro comico.</li>
<li>Ripercorrere con il linguaggio dell'umorismo l'esperienza dei migranti e le difficoltà legate all'ospitalità degli italiani, attraverso una visione meno negativa e conflittuale dell'intercultura.</li>
<li>Superare le barriere culturali e ribaltare gli stereotipi attraverso la messa in scena in chiave umoristica delle esperienze legate alla vita in Italia da extracomunitari e migranti.</li>
<li>Valorizzare la diversità culturale e la ricchezza derivante dalla condivisione di diversi saperi anche in ambito teatrale.</li>
<li>Stimolare media ed opinione pubblica a modificare il paradigma con cui sono raccontati gli stranieri in Italia (poveri di risorse e/o pericolosi per la società).</li>

La commedia ha come protagonisti alcuni profughi e rifugiati giunti nell’ultimo periodo, in gran parte attraverso il mare mediterraneo, su mezzi di fortuna e ospitati nei maggiori centri italiani di prima e seconda accoglienza.</p><p>Attraverso le loro testimonianze, lo spettacolo intende seguire l’avventura di chi, per fuggire a fame e guerra, è stato costretto ad attraversare il mare in cerca di nuovi spazi in cui vivere. Sarà un’alternanza di momenti di riflessione e impreviste situazioni buffe, risolte con sketch talvolta parlati, altre volte visuali, altre ancora a brevi monologhi in puro stile stand-up comedy.</p><p>Insieme a loro, sul palcoscenico, si muoveranno due attori professionisti africani ma da anni residenti in Italia, entrambi protagonisti del nostro panorama culturale: <i>Mohamed Ba</i> e <i>Samuel Hili </i>(il primo Senegalese ma residente a Milano, il secondo Ivoriano ma da anni a Mantova).</p><p>Il Sogno di Enea vuole essere innanzitutto uno spettacolo comico, che stimola il riso attraverso linguaggi e stili diversi. Dalle prime battute fino alla fine dello spettacolo, però, l’umorismo non è mai semplicemente un gioco liberatorio, finalizzato al divertimento e allo svago, bensì utilizzato come strumento di integrazione tra persone, popoli e culture.</p><p>Perché l’umorismo (a differenza della musica o del teatro, per esempio) non è un linguaggio universale: se ognuno di noi ride per cose differenti, già all’interno della stessa famiglia, possiamo immaginarci le differenze tra popoli, culture, religioni, età diversa.</p><p>La conquista sarà quindi ridere, ridere tanto e ridere insieme, perché se possiamo ridere tutti delle stesse cose allora non siamo poi così diversi l’uno dall’altro. Lo spettacolo alternerà momenti immaginifici, in stile quasi fiabesco, a passaggi puramente comici.</p><p>E ridendo, possiamo riflettere sulla realtà di questa epoca, nella quale due mondi, divisi dal Mar Mediterraneo, si affrontano e si confrontano, si attraggono e si respingono: un mondo che cerca pace e un minimo benessere materiale e un altro che ha il disperato bisogno di sogni e di speranze per ritrovare se stesso.</p><p>Ad accompagnare l’intero spettacolo saranno musiche evocative, alcune originali, altre necessariamente note, utili all’identificazione storico-culturale tra il pubblico, la storia e i suoi protagonisti. Nell’impianto scenografico ci sarà posto per alcuni contributi video, funzionali all’evoluzione della storia.</p><p>Lo spettacolo sarà in parte in lingua italiana e in parte nelle lingue dei protagonisti: inglese e francese ma anche lingue dei paesi di provenienza.</p><p>A interpretare i personaggi dello spettacolo saranno 5 ragazzi scelti in questi mesi nei centri di prima e seconda accoglienza in Puglia e che hanno partecipato ai laboratori ed al corso che si sta svolgendo tra settembre e novembre.</p><p> </p><p><strong>IL DOCUMENTARIO</strong></p><p>Il documentario <i>Il Sogno di Enea</i> è la storia di un incontro, umano e professionale, tra un protagonista, italiano, e un gruppo composto da vari co-protagonisti.</p><p>Il viaggio nasce dai primi incontri tra <i>Matteo Androne</i>, autore, regista, docente teatrale e studioso di pensiero e linguaggio umoristico, fondatore e direttore dell’<i>Accademia Nazionale del Comico</i>, con un gruppo di migranti che vivono in alcuni centri di accoglienza, di vario tipo, arrivati da pochi mesi in Italia.</p><p>Lavorando fianco a fianco durante un percorso di 3/4 mesi, Matteo e i suoi co-protagonisti daranno vita e corpo a uno spettacolo interculturale e multilinguistico, basato sulle esperienze dei migranti, dalla vita nel paese di origine, al viaggio per giungere in Europa, fino alla permanenza in Italia, per presentarlo poi al pubblico in una tournée nazionale.</p><p>Il documentario seguirà l’evoluzione del progetto, dai primi incontri, dalle prime idee dei ragazzi, dai loro racconti, fino al complesso momento di creazione di uno spettacolo comico. Un percorso affascinante ma di non semplice attuazione: per i comprensibili ostacoli burocratici, le difficoltà tecniche e logistiche, l’emergere continuo di differenze culturali, comportamentali e relazionali e, non ultimo, le traversie legali che i migranti devono affrontare per vedersi o non vedersi riconosciuto lo stato di rifugiato.</p><p>Attraverso il vivere e lo scrivere insieme, i partecipanti al laboratorio daranno un’opportunità nuova e unica al pubblico di rovesciare il paradigma in cui il cittadino europeo si trova incastrato, frutto dell’apparentemente incontrastabile dicotomia “immigrato come “vittima” o “rischioso pericolo sociale”.</p><p>Il conflitto è anche la sfida che tutti i protagonisti lanciano al pubblico stesso, nello scegliere una forma e un linguaggio meno convenzionale, quello dell’umorismo, per affrontare temi personali e spesso drammatici ma reali e quotidiani.</p><p>Il documentario infine vuole evidenziare l’arricchimento personale che può nascere, per i tre soggetti coinvolti, l’insegnante, i ragazzi migranti e per il pubblico stesso, dal poter vedere ed ascoltare l’incontro e lo scambio tra Matteo, uomo di teatro dallo sguardo ironico, sensibile e onesto, e un gruppo di persone, spaesate in un sistema sociale non familiare, che hanno tuttavia il diritto di vivere e lavorare in libertà e con dignità, dopo aver compiuto una scelta difficilissima come quella della migrazione.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506545496/r0ccjqz7ok9lsmduzr7r.png"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>COME VENGONO IMPIEGATE LE VOSTRE DONAZIONI ?</strong></u></h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Creazione e gestione dei laboratori di formazione</i></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Ideazione e drammaturgia</i></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Prove compagnia teatrale</i></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Regia e allestimento dello spettacolo</i></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Logistica</i></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Sound location</i></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Post-produzione documentario Montaggio, Coloring, Grafiche, Mixing audio,</i></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Composizione e Diritti Musicali</i></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Promozione, Festival e Distribuzione</i></strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506545513/uz3wvi5xmu3xmw6fktds.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>PROGETTO CAMBOGIA</strong></p><p>Parte del ricavato de Il Sogno di Enea sarà impiegato per aiutare 142 bambini a frequentare un anno di studi presso la <i>Angkor Tree School</i>, una scuola sita in una delle zone più povere del mondo. Per mantenere aperta la scuola servono circa 9,000 $ all’anno e le donazioni annuali arrivano a un massimo di 4,500 $. La restante parte abbiamo deciso di mettercela noi, devolvendo parte dell’incasso proprio de Il Sogno di Enea.</p><p>E' un’operazione che avrà una ricaduta concreta, per dare la possibilità a bambini molto poveri di continuare a studiare. Avrà però anche un valore simbolico, dal momento che a contribuire ai loro studi saranno proprio un gruppo di migranti in Italia, anch'essi fuggiti dalla guerra e dalla povertà.

(and click for subtitles on the video) PREMESSAIn Italia, terra di confine tra il benessere dell'occidente e i territori colpiti dalla povertà e dalla guerra, si sta diffondendo in modo pericoloso la paura del diverso, inteso come rappresentante di una differente cultura, religione, stato sociale e visione del mondo.Per questo vogliamo parlare insieme a voi di migranti in modo diverso.Nasce perciò l'idea di costituire la prima compagnia teatrale umoristica, composta da immigrati ospitati nei centri di accoglienza italiani.L'umorismo è un linguaggio universale, diretto e popolare, funzionale a unire i diversi punti di vista e a sdrammatizzare le esperienze tragiche. Attraverso il suo utilizzo è possibile fare incontrare su un terreno comune culture differenti, ribaltare gli stereotipi e stimolare l'autoironia sia di chi osserva sia di chi lo pratica.OBIETTIVI
Costruire attraverso laboratori di umorismo occasioni di crescita e benessere per le popolazioni immigrate, oltre che opportunità professionali e di autostima per chi vuole far parte di una compagnia di teatro comico.
Ripercorrere con il linguaggio dell'umorismo l'esperienza dei migranti e le difficoltà legate all'ospitalità degli italiani, attraverso una visione meno negativa e conflittuale dell'intercultura.
Superare le barriere culturali e ribaltare gli stereotipi attraverso la messa in scena in chiave umoristica delle esperienze legate alla vita in Italia da extracomunitari e migranti.
Valorizzare la diversità culturale e la ricchezza derivante dalla condivisione di diversi saperi anche in ambito teatrale.
Stimolare media ed opinione pubblica a modificare il paradigma con cui sono raccontati gli stranieri in Italia (poveri di risorse e/o pericolosi per la società).
PROTAGONISTIMigranti appena arrivati in Italia o con riconoscimento della protezione internazionale. Ospiti dei centri di prima e seconda accoglienza. Comunità di stranieri già attive sul territorio.IL PROGETTO
Costituire una COMPAGNIA DI TEATRO COMICO, con attori extracomunitari provenienti da paesi diversi, accomunati da una buona capacità scenica, un certo senso dell’umorismo e soprattutto la disponibilità a mettersi in gioco.
Allestire uno SPETTACOLO multiculturale e multilinguistico sulle loro esperienze, dal viaggio alla permanenza nel nostro paese, per presentarlo al pubblico in Italia.
Distribuire lo spettacolo nel circuito teatrale italiano, rivolgendosi prima alle scuole, quindi a un pubblico generico e scuole.
 
Produrre un lungometraggio DOCUMENTARIO. Seguire il percorso della compagnia attraverso sensazioni, voci ed immagini, per raccontare una storia di un incontro. Quello di un regista italiano con i ragazzi migranti e quello dei ragazzi con il pubblico italiano.
Distribuire il documentario nazionalmente ed internazionalmente, a partire dalle scuole.
 Pubblicare un LIBRO che raccolga i racconti di autori stranieri residenti in Italia già da qualche anno. Anche in questo caso il linguaggio scelto sarà quello umoristico. In appendice ai racconti, alcuni tra i maggiori ricercatori di umorismo approfondiranno l’argomento per dimostrare quanto  come l’umorismo possa essere un prezioso strumento di confronto e di interazione tra persone, popoli e culture.  LO SPETTACOLO TEATRALEIl Sogno di Enea sarà uno spettacolo corale, immaginato insieme a chi, in questi anni, sta emigrando verso il nostro continente. La commedia ha come protagonisti alcuni profughi e rifugiati giunti nell’ultimo periodo, in gran parte attraverso il mare mediterraneo, su mezzi di fortuna e ospitati nei maggiori centri italiani di prima e seconda accoglienza.Attraverso le loro testimonianze, lo spettacolo intende seguire l’avventura di chi, per fuggire a fame e guerra, è stato costretto ad attraversare il mare in cerca di nuovi spazi in cui vivere. Sarà un’alternanza di momenti di riflessione e impreviste situazioni buffe, risolte con sketch talvolta parlati, altre volte visuali, altre ancora a brevi monologhi in puro stile stand-up comedy.Insieme a loro, sul palcoscenico, si muoveranno due attori professionisti africani ma da anni residenti in Italia, entrambi protagonisti del nostro panorama culturale: Mohamed Ba e Samuel Hili (il primo Senegalese ma residente a Milano, il secondo Ivoriano ma da anni a Mantova).Il Sogno di Enea vuole essere innanzitutto uno spettacolo comico, che stimola il riso attraverso linguaggi e stili diversi. Dalle prime battute fino alla fine dello spettacolo, però, l’umorismo non è mai semplicemente un gioco liberatorio, finalizzato al divertimento e allo svago, bensì utilizzato come strumento di integrazione tra persone, popoli e culture.Perché l’umorismo (a differenza della musica o del teatro, per esempio) non è un linguaggio universale: se ognuno di noi ride per cose differenti, già all’interno della stessa famiglia, possiamo immaginarci le differenze tra popoli, culture, religioni, età diversa.La conquista sarà quindi ridere, ridere tanto e ridere insieme, perché se possiamo ridere tutti delle stesse cose allora non siamo poi così diversi l’uno dall’altro. Lo spettacolo alternerà momenti immaginifici, in stile quasi fiabesco, a passaggi puramente comici.E ridendo, possiamo riflettere sulla realtà di questa epoca, nella quale due mondi, divisi dal Mar Mediterraneo, si affrontano e si confrontano, si attraggono e si respingono: un mondo che cerca pace e un minimo benessere materiale e un altro che ha il disperato bisogno di sogni e di speranze per ritrovare se stesso.Ad accompagnare l’intero spettacolo saranno musiche evocative, alcune originali, altre necessariamente note, utili all’identificazione storico-culturale tra il pubblico, la storia e i suoi protagonisti. Nell’impianto scenografico ci sarà posto per alcuni contributi video, funzionali all’evoluzione della storia.Lo spettacolo sarà in parte in lingua italiana e in parte nelle lingue dei protagonisti: inglese e francese ma anche lingue dei paesi di provenienza.A interpretare i personaggi dello spettacolo saranno 5 ragazzi scelti in questi mesi nei centri di prima e seconda accoglienza in Puglia e che hanno partecipato ai laboratori ed al corso che si sta svolgendo tra settembre e novembre. IL DOCUMENTARIOIl documentario Il Sogno di Enea è la storia di un incontro, umano e professionale, tra un protagonista, italiano, e un gruppo composto da vari co-protagonisti.Il viaggio nasce dai primi incontri tra Matteo Androne, autore, regista, docente teatrale e studioso di pensiero e linguaggio umoristico, fondatore e direttore dell’Accademia Nazionale del Comico, con un gruppo di migranti che vivono in alcuni centri di accoglienza, di vario tipo, arrivati da pochi mesi in Italia.Lavorando fianco a fianco durante un percorso di 3/4 mesi, Matteo e i suoi co-protagonisti daranno vita e corpo a uno spettacolo interculturale e multilinguistico, basato sulle esperienze dei migranti, dalla vita nel paese di origine, al viaggio per giungere in Europa, fino alla permanenza in Italia, per presentarlo poi al pubblico in una tournée nazionale.Il documentario seguirà l’evoluzione del progetto, dai primi incontri, dalle prime idee dei ragazzi, dai loro racconti, fino al complesso momento di creazione di uno spettacolo comico. Un percorso affascinante ma di non semplice attuazione: per i comprensibili ostacoli burocratici, le difficoltà tecniche e logistiche, l’emergere continuo di differenze culturali, comportamentali e relazionali e, non ultimo, le traversie legali che i migranti devono affrontare per vedersi o non vedersi riconosciuto lo stato di rifugiato.Attraverso il vivere e lo scrivere insieme, i partecipanti al laboratorio daranno un’opportunità nuova e unica al pubblico di rovesciare il paradigma in cui il cittadino europeo si trova incastrato, frutto dell’apparentemente incontrastabile dicotomia “immigrato come “vittima” o “rischioso pericolo sociale”.Il conflitto è anche la sfida che tutti i protagonisti lanciano al pubblico stesso, nello scegliere una forma e un linguaggio meno convenzionale, quello dell’umorismo, per affrontare temi personali e spesso drammatici ma reali e quotidiani.Il documentario infine vuole evidenziare l’arricchimento personale che può nascere, per i tre soggetti coinvolti, l’insegnante, i ragazzi migranti e per il pubblico stesso, dal poter vedere ed ascoltare l’incontro e lo scambio tra Matteo, uomo di teatro dallo sguardo ironico, sensibile e onesto, e un gruppo di persone, spaesate in un sistema sociale non familiare, che hanno tuttavia il diritto di vivere e lavorare in libertà e con dignità, dopo aver compiuto una scelta difficilissima come quella della migrazione.  COME VENGONO IMPIEGATE LE VOSTRE DONAZIONI ?Creazione e gestione dei laboratori di formazioneIdeazione e drammaturgiaProve compagnia teatraleRegia e allestimento dello spettacoloLogisticaSound locationPost-produzione documentario Montaggio, Coloring, Grafiche, Mixing audio,Composizione e Diritti MusicaliPromozione, Festival e Distribuzione PROGETTO CAMBOGIAParte del ricavato de Il Sogno di Enea sarà impiegato per aiutare 142 bambini a frequentare un anno di studi presso la Angkor Tree School, una scuola sita in una delle zone più povere del mondo. Per mantenere aperta la scuola servono circa 9,000 $ all’anno e le donazioni annuali arrivano a un massimo di 4,500 $. La restante parte abbiamo deciso di mettercela noi, devolvendo parte dell’incasso proprio de Il Sogno di Enea.E' un’operazione che avrà una ricaduta concreta, per dare la possibilità a bambini molto poveri di continuare a studiare. Avrà però anche un valore simbolico, dal momento che a contribuire ai loro studi saranno proprio un gruppo di migranti in Italia, anch'essi fuggiti dalla guerra e dalla povertà. Tutto questo attraverso l’arte, il teatro e l’umorismo.Per provare a spiegare meglio il significato dell’operazione, ci affidiamo alle parole di Roberto Cesarone, fondatore di Erasmus Theatre.“ La scorsa estate, durante un viaggio nel sud est asiatico, ho incontrato una volontaria argentina che prestava servizio in quella che è una delle zone più povere del mondo. Grazie a lei ho conosciuto due professori cambogiani che stavano costruendo, in un piccolo paese, una scuola per bambini.

There will be five performances June 27-30 at The Alchemical 104 W 14th Street, NYC. 
Keeping it simple
We are approaching Romeo & Juliet from a minimalist, actor as 
storyteller standpoint. The company is exploring 
themes of family, bondage, independence, idolatry, violence, fate 
and destruction in the wake of love incubated in a hostile environment.  Here's much to do with hate but more with love. -Romeo

<div>My name is Bianca Moore. I was born in Taylor, Mi at Wyanndotte Hospital on Februrary 23, 1999. From the time I began elementary until the 4th grade I lived in Taylor and went to Blair Moody Elementary. When I was 6 years old, my father moved to Atlanta, Georgia. By the time I was 9, my family lost our house. Between my 4th and 5th grade years, our family moved from hotel to motel, and eventually ended up having no where to stay at all. We moved in with my aunt, she helped us get back on our feet and we ended up getting an apartment in Ypsilanti, MI. We lived in these apartments for a year or two, then my mom lost her job at Pfizer. We moved in with her boyfriend who lived upstairs at the moment, but he soon passed away from alcohol poisioning. We eventually were evicted and began to travel from hotel to hotel once again. When I was 14 we moved into a shelter called the Alpha House. The Alpha House helped us so much, If it wasn't for them we wouldn't have the apartment we have now in Hamilton crossings. Alpha House helped my mom get a job a Meijer which she eventually lost. My mothers signifigant other just passed away a few days ago from the same alcohol poisioning problem. He sort of helped with finances but now we have no income whatsoever.  My dad usually helps me when I need things but his health hasn't been to well lately and he's not able to work. I haven't gotten new clothes for the last two years and I dont necessarily plan on getting any anytime soon. I'm used to it so it doesn't really bother me anymore, I just try and look my best with what I have.</div> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<div>I am now in need of funds for this years homecoming at Huron High school. I wasn't able to go to homecoming freshmen year and now that I know more people, I really want to go. My father just introduced me to this website and we both figured that this would be a great help. Homecoming is all I have been thinking of lately. It would be a chance for me to show people how well I clean up and I would love to see the look on everyones faces if that would be possible. It would be the best feeling in the world. If you or someone else could help me It would be a great help. Raising money for someone to go to homecoming sounds really selfish and I do understand that but its more to it than just having a chance to be at homecoming. It's a chance to gain respect and show others who I really am and what I can really look like. Thank you so much. </div>

<p><strong>Theatre Conspiracy</strong> taps the crosscurrents of international culture, society and politics to create, interpret, translate and curate theatre shows that speak beyond borders.

<h2>
<strong><br/></strong><strong>WHAT IS <em>EXTRACTION</em>?   </strong>榨</h2>
<p><strong><em>A bilingual (English and Mandarin) documentary theatre show</em></strong> based on the experiences of non-actor performers from Beijing, Vancouver and Fort McMurray. Their stories — of the transitions from their native countries to new lives in foreign lands —intimately illuminate the highly charged political debates about tar sands development, Chinese investment in Fort McMurray, pipeline construction and Canada’s relationship with China. The play delves deeply into matters of translation, cultural nuance and the immigrant/expat experience.</p>
<p><strong>Extraction</strong> <strong><em>is about real people.</em></strong> The performers play themselves: A <strong>former Canadian diplomat</strong> <strong>and journalist </strong>who spent the most of the past 20 years in China; a <strong>freelance interpreter from Beijing</strong> who has worked for James Cameron and Tony Blair, <strong>a recent Chinese immigrant</strong> trying to make a new life in Vancouver, and a worker from the Fort McMurray industry.</p>
<p><strong>Extraction<em> is participatory. </em></strong> Conspiracy artistic producer Tim Carlson and director Amiel Gladstone worked with the innovative Rimini Protokoll on the acclaimed documentary theatre show <em>100% Vancouver</em> (PuSh International Performing Arts Festival, 2011), which brought 100 Vancouverites together to tell the story of their city. Carlson also worked with Rimini Protokoll, which has produced work around the world, on <em>Best Before</em>, in which the audience used game consoles to shape a show that also featured real people telling their own stories. <em>Best Before</em> began in Vancouver and enjoyed 14 international engagements.</p>
<p><em>Extraction</em> will draw on those innovations to explore globally important industrial development and the effects on people's lives.</p>
<p><em>“What a wonderful experiment. Thank you for taking on such a huge story, a down-home story right from our own backyard.”</em> – Carey, Richmond</p>
<h2><strong><br/> WHY FUND IT? WHAT YOU GET<br/></strong></h2>
<p>After visits to China and Fort McMurray and a year of refining the concept for the show, we developed and rehearsed <em>Extraction</em> in July 2012 and presented a work-in-progress performance on <strong>July 21</strong> at <strong>Your Kontinent: Richmond International Film &amp; Media Arts Festival</strong> to great reviews.

<p>Vancouver theatre does not adequately connect with the city’s vast array of cultures.  <em>Extraction</em> speaks to the contemporary experiences and interests of the Mandarin-speaking community through a bilingual show with live translation.

Flanders upcoming production of Mozart's Cosi Fan Tutte so we could compare notes on sets and costumes (one of my gigs on the project),Naomi is setting the opera in 1969, somewhere on the ocean near Boston; there's a war on and young men are being drafted. Two guys, two girls, a scheming professor and a clever housemaid combine for a hilarious and gorgeous romp through concealed identities, naughty wagers, shocking discoveries and love a la Woodstock in Mozart's funniest work ever.Nicholas was composing a tune on his accordion in front of the set and I shot this video to capture the moment. Enjoy.

""Finding Gavin: Unexpected Survival Lessons"" tells the story of his family - how his mom and dad, Margret and Bobby (as well as his sister Aly), met, fell in love, welcomed him into the world, and survived losing him far too soon. </p><p style=""letter-spacing: normal;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">""<i>People who are going through this have a feeling, fundamentally in </i></span><i>their bones, that they cannot survive this. And they can survive this, and not just survive it, but find laughter again... Bobby and I will never get over this, but we've survived and continue to survive because we broke some of the rules.</i>""</p><p>          -Margret Echeverria</p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>WHAT IS SIDS?</b></p><p>Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) are the third leading cause of infant mortality in the United States and the leading cause of death among infants aged 1–12 months - approximately 4000 per year. It's a frightening prospect because it can strike without warning, usually in seemingly healthy babies. And we still don’t know exactly what causes SIDS or SUID at this time. </p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></b></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">WHY IS THIS SHOW IMPORTANT?</b><br/></p><p style=""letter-spacing: normal;"">""<i>SIDS is not talked about and it's time we talk about it and heal from it.</i>"" </p><p style=""letter-spacing: normal;"">         - Margret Echeverria</p><p>Margret is stepping out to let people know they are not alone, nothing they are going through is unsurvivable, and no matter how bleak it seems, there is light, there is laughter, and there is love. Margret and Bobby's story, sadly, is not unique. And it is because of that that people need to hear it. </p><p>""<i>The most valuable experiences we had as we moved through our grief and our loss were when others came to us and shared their loss and how they learned to live with it... It was such a blessing and a really extraordinary and healing thing...

""Finding Gavin: Unexpected Survival Lessons"" tells the story of his family - how his mom and dad, Margret and Bobby (as well as his sister Aly), met, fell in love, welcomed him into the world, and survived losing him far too soon. ""People who are going through this have a feeling, fundamentally in their bones, that they cannot survive this. And they can survive this, and not just survive it, but find laughter again... Bobby and I will never get over this, but we've survived and continue to survive because we broke some of the rules.""          -Margret EcheverriaWHAT IS SIDS?Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) and Sudden Unexpected Infant Death (SUID) are the third leading cause of infant mortality in the United States and the leading cause of death among infants aged 1–12 months - approximately 4000 per year. It's a frightening prospect because it can strike without warning, usually in seemingly healthy babies. And we still don’t know exactly what causes SIDS or SUID at this time. WHY IS THIS SHOW IMPORTANT?""SIDS is not talked about and it's time we talk about it and heal from it.""          - Margret EcheverriaMargret is stepping out to let people know they are not alone, nothing they are going through is unsurvivable, and no matter how bleak it seems, there is light, there is laughter, and there is love. Margret and Bobby's story, sadly, is not unique. And it is because of that that people need to hear it. ""The most valuable experiences we had as we moved through our grief and our loss were when others came to us and shared their loss and how they learned to live with it... It was such a blessing and a really extraordinary and healing thing... So if this show can be that vehicle to let others know that we're still here - that we found joy again after experiencing this loss - then that will make this show worthwhile.""         - Margret Echeverria""One of the most important aspects, to us, when we set out to create this show, was that we did not want it to become a ""How To Guide"" for grief.

<p>Studying abroad in Italy, Alyssa gets caught up in a whirlwind of sex, drugs and violence...  Her Mother gets a phone call.</p>
<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p><span>FullStop Collective is a New York City-based multidisciplinary theater laboratory currently in its fifth season of groundbreaking new work.  We have been developing OUTFOXED through readings and workshops for the past eighteen months. Playwright Lucy Gillespie continued to develop the script during a residency at the MacDowell Colony earlier this year. <br/></span></p>
<p>OUTFOXED is a headline-making story about a bookish American young woman who is swept up in a life of sex and drugs while studying abroad. After one particularly wild night, she finds herself at the center of a cultural, moral and legal maelstrom 6,000 miles from home.  </p>
<p>Your support will help FullStop pay our incredibly talented actors, book space to rehearse and experiment, and enable our designers to realize their visions in this dramatic, theatrical world.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We need your help. </h3>
<p>FullStop has produced fourteen productions in five years, and has consistently operated on a smartly balanced budget.  Your contributions are essential to our continued growth and increased production value.  </p>
<p>We are seeking $3,000 in contributions to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay our actors ($1,000)</li>
<li>Pay for rehearsal space ($1,200)</li>
<li>Support our design elements ($800)</li>
</ul>
<p>Funds raised above this amount will go to pay our designers and production team, boost our marketing strategy, and cover vital administrative costs associated with producing new theater in New York City.</p>
<p>In thanks, we offer an assortment of perks!  All donors will receive a personal thank-you from FullStop Collective, and donors over $25 will be thanked in the production program.  Donors above certain levels will enjoy FullStop merchandise, complimentary tickets to OUTFOXED performances, a personalized video thank-you from members the production, and a private wine reception with the cast and creative team!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We care very much about this project.  It not only holds artistic and personal significance within the Collective, it is also a timely meditation on perceptions and behaviors across nationalities. The world has become an increasingly small place that we all must co-habitat. By supporting OUTFOXED, you will become part of a years-long vision for the development and production of artistically exhilirating and emotionally resonant theater.  This is a culminating piece for FullStop, our biggest independant endeavor yet, and we would be honored to partner with you in bringing this vision to life.</p>
<h3>Looking for other ways to show your support?</h3>

<h3>Our Project</h3>
<p>The Chicago debut of ""Electra"" by Euripides (newly adapted by Sonja Moser) has been made possible thus far by the generous efforts of  <strong>Carlo Garcia</strong>, an <strong>lllinois State University</strong> Alumni, and <strong>Mary-Arrchie Theatre Company</strong>. The cast of this imaginative meta-theatrical spin on Euripide's Greek tragedy consists of 17 Illinois State University Undergraduate Theatre students.  This project marks an unprecedented opportunity for actors, designers, and stage managers of the Illinios State University's School of Theatre to present a collaborative production in Chicago that showcases their creative efforts.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This production of <strong>""Electra""</strong>, presented by<strong> Mary-Arrchie Theatre Company </strong>in association with <strong>Illinois State University's School of Theatre</strong>, has created a rare opportunity for current theatre students and Chicagoland alumni to connect. For the cast, its a chance to showcase a production at a reputable Chicago Storefront that is 27 years in the making. <strong>Mary Arrchie's</strong> committment to the creation of intimate, high impact, craft-centered productions is precisely what we as young emerging theatre artists aspire to be a part of. The primary goal of this project is not only to create captivating work for our audiences, but to also gain knowledge from the experience of presenting this work at a Chicago Storefront that has opened its doors to us. Due to the faith and support of our production by <strong>Illinois State University's School of Theatre </strong>alumni <strong>Carlo Garcia</strong>  this project is possible. For this privelege, we are extremely grateful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where We Need Your Help</strong></p>
<p>The 'Electra' cast is thrilled with this incredible opportunity to present their work, but we need some help getting there. The students involved will be commuting from Central Illinois to Downtown Chicago. Due to increasing travel expenses, the cost of most of the commutes are beyond the means of individual students involved.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here's how your donations would be assisting us:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>CTA month passes</strong> to transport students taking the Metra- from Union/Oligilvie station to the Angel Island Theatre(Redline-Sheridan stop) at the cost of $86 each. </li>
<li>
<strong>Gas.</strong> For members of our cast that are driving 2-3 hrs to and from the theatre, the cost of gas is definitely a stumbling block. Any amount to help supplement these costs would be extremely beneficial.</li>
<li>
<strong>Living Expenses. </strong>Students that are subletting housing for the run of the production are in need of financial support to cover a small percentage of this cost.</li>
<li><strong>There's no such thing as a contribution that is too small. Any help at all is greatly appreciated!</strong></li>
</ul><p><strong>Our Show- Description</strong></p>
<p><em>""Electra and her brother Orestes seek to avenge the death of their father at the hands of their mother and her lover. Set in John Deere country, this inventive meta-theatrical adaptation of the famous Euripides tragedy is filled with live rock music, humor, teen angst, and sweet, sweet muddy revenge. </em><em>Don’t be afraid to get dirty.""</em></p>

<p>‘Once upon a time there was a country that existed only for one day…’</p>
<p>Adam, a castaway, believes that he is the lost prince of the country of Gildoray… but no one even believes that Gildoray exists. Still Adam journeys the world over, battling pirates and monsters, rescuing princesses, and doing daring deeds of heroism, ever searching for his lost kingdom.</p>

<p>From St Andrews to Edinburgh, epic fantasy invades the Fringe!</p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are a group of students from the University of St Andrews in Scotland, taking our first show to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. We range from PhD candidates to first-year undergraduates, and hail from the U.K., the U.S., and Norway. Our director is a member of the Scottish Youth Theatre, and our producer is a graduate of NYU Tisch Drama. We had a successful run of <em>The World Over</em> at St Andrews in December, and are now bringing mythical creatures, heroic quests, and thrilling late-night swordfighting to Edinburgh!</p>
<h3>
<strong>W</strong><strong>hat We Need</strong>
</h3>
<p>Bringing a show to the Edinburgh Fringe is an expensive operation and we're running solely on our own funds and partial funding from Mermaids (the University of St Andrews' dramatic society) and the Antony Tudor Fund (the University's grant-giving body for drama). Contributions to the show will go towards costs not covered by outside funding, such as a rehearsal space, additional props and costumes and daily running costs, as well as living expenses for cast/crew once production costs are met. </p>
<p>Here's what your donation pays for:</p>
<p>$10: 1 medium-sized prop/costume piece</p>
<p>$25: 1/3 of the cost of rights for 1 performance</p>
<p>$50: 1 day in a rehearsal studio</p>
<p>$100: 80 posters + 1,500 flyers</p>
<p>$250: 2 weeks' accommodation for 1 actor</p>
<p>$500: Venue rental for 2 performances</p>

‘Once upon a time there was a country that existed only for one day…’
Adam, a castaway, believes that he is the lost prince of the country of Gildoray… but no one even believes that Gildoray exists. Still Adam journeys the world over, battling pirates and monsters, rescuing princesses, and doing daring deeds of heroism, ever searching for his lost kingdom.
‘The production is as impressive as it is flawless’ – St Andrews Radio
‘A swash-buckling adventure of epic proportions’ – The Tribe
From St Andrews to Edinburgh, epic fantasy invades the Fringe!
Who We Are
We are a group of students from the University of St Andrews in Scotland, taking our first show to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. We range from PhD candidates to first-year undergraduates, and hail from the U.K., the U.S., and Norway. Our director is a member of the Scottish Youth Theatre, and our producer is a graduate of NYU Tisch Drama. We had a successful run of The World Over at St Andrews in December, and are now bringing mythical creatures, heroic quests, and thrilling late-night swordfighting to Edinburgh!

What We Need

Bringing a show to the Edinburgh Fringe is an expensive operation and we're running solely on our own funds and partial funding from Mermaids (the University of St Andrews' dramatic society) and the Antony Tudor Fund (the University's grant-giving body for drama). Contributions to the show will go towards costs not covered by outside funding, such as a rehearsal space, additional props and costumes and daily running costs, as well as living expenses for cast/crew once production costs are met. 
Here's what your donation pays for:
$10: 1 medium-sized prop/costume piece
$25: 1/3 of the cost of rights for 1 performance
$50: 1 day in a rehearsal studio
$100: 80 posters + 1,500 flyers
$250: 2 weeks' accommodation for 1 actor
$500: Venue rental for 2 performances
What You'll Get
In return for your help we can offer you a variety of benefits ranging from special mention on our website for your services to free tickets, a copy of the script signed by the cast and crew, an invite to the cast party, and more!

<p>It’s about how women come together and celebrate one another.</p>
<p>We are asking our community to support what we think is immensely valuable to enrich the theatre scene and create a whole host of dynamic, supportive and badass women in one show.

<h3>Bringing Classical Music to Life</h3>
<p>We are hatching a new kind of performance that blends classical music and live theater. As musicians, classical music is the central focus of our lives. However, we realize that not everyone finds it so easy to understand and enjoy our work. Through this project, we hope to illuminate classical music so that others can enjoy it as much as we do.</p>
<p>Our main shows will be held at the Boston University Dance Theater on May 4, 2019. With funds from this campaign, we plan to hold <strong>an additional free performance for young people in Boston</strong>. These talented kids are studying classical music and circus arts, but they live in underserved neighborhoods where they might not see many shows like this one. We want to inspire them so that they can see where the arts may lead them.</p>
<h2><strong>The show</strong></h2>
<p>When you come to our show, sit up close while a live quartet performs Dmitri Shostakovich's String Quartet No. 6 in nearly total darkness. During intermission, we will provide our guests with Russian pelmeni dumplings, pickles, and kompot (juice) to get a taste of the flavors of Shostakovich’s native cuisine. After intermission we'll perform the same piece again, this time as part of a story told by contemporary circus performers, including a silks act, ground acrobatics, and physical theatre pieces. The story is inspired by Shostakovich's life, which is rich with material. He ran into all sorts of trouble with Soviet censors and spent many decades in fear that he was about to get sent off to a gulag. The production explores <strong>the power of the arts </strong>to <strong>resist authoritarianism</strong>.</p>
<p>The first half of the show encourages audience members to <strong>listen deeply</strong> and let their imaginations run freely, while the second half illustrates our own interpretation of the music. The whole show lasts an hour, allowing plenty of time afterwards for audience members to talk with the performers and with each other.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's the lowdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're raising money to fund an <strong>additional free performance for kids</strong> who are part of Circus Up! and the Roxbury Youth Orchestra, so that they can see what's possible with the art forms they're studying.</li>
<li>We believe that <strong>artists should be paid</strong> for their work. The proceeds from this campaign will allow us to pay our artists for this outreach performance.</li>
<li>In thanks for your donations, we have great perks! You could get VIP tickets to our May 4 show, super-cool Dmitri swag designed by artist Phanousit Syhakhom, your name encoded into a musical performance, or even a personal concert in your home!</li>
<li>Even if we don't reach our entire goal, every dollar raised will still go towards paying artists to participate in this<strong> free performance for young underserved artists in Boston.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you feel like you just don't ""get"" classical music, you're not alone. Only 8% of the population has seen a classical music performance this year. Compare this to Soviet Russia, where everyone awaited Shostakovich's symphonic premieres with great anticipation. <strong>Classical music can communicate humanity's deepest emotions.</strong> By giving the music a visual component, the goal is to make it more interesting to audiences who are newer to classical music.</p>
<p>Circus Up! and the Roxbury Youth Orchestra are amazing organizations training Boston's young people in the arts. We want to share our creation with students so that they can experience the power of the arts first-hand.</p>
<p>By presenting a performance that is based in classical music but that also involves circus arts, theater, and Soviet history, we are presenting Shostakovich’s music in an immersive way to <strong>broaden the boundaries of what our audience considers to be classical music</strong>. Furthermore, we believe the repeated listening and visual component in our performance will help the audience engage with the music on a deeper level. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Circus Up!</h3>
<p>Circus Up uses circus arts to overcome social barriers and build community with people of all ages, backgrounds, and abilities. The organization has been bringing their vision of <strong>social circus</strong> to Boston.</p>
<p>Social circus often means prioritizing the idea that underserved populations should have access to circus arts, and also that circus arts can and should be used to build life skills, such as confidence, resilience, communication, and the ability to self-advocate. Social circus often works with at-risk youth, using circus arts as a medium for social justice and for providing opportunities to children in underserved communities.  </p>
<p>Students in grades K-12 who have participated in Circus Up's in-school and after-school programs will be invited to our free performance. More info on the organization is available at <a href=""http://www.circusup.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.circusup.com</a>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Roxbury Youth Orchestra</h3>
<p>The Roxbury Youth Orchestra is a world-class music education initiative in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston. The program is guided by the belief that an intensive music education can have transformative effects on both the individual and society.</p>
<p>RYO students receive over 15 hours of conservatory-level instruction each week including lessons, technique classes, orchestra, and chorus. Participants also perform in numerous local and citywide events. In this way the program provides <strong>a daily haven of safety, joy, and fun</strong> that will build every child’s self-esteem and sense of value.</p>
<p>Members of the Dmitri in the Dark quartet will visit the Roxbury Youth Orchestra to perform a movement from the piece. Then RYO members will be invited to our free performance.</p>

<h3>Who we are:</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The Bellwether Project is a collective of young, excited artists, formed at Carnegie Mellon University in the spirit of collaboration and intersectional storytelling. Over its 4 years as a company, BWP has produced 3 world premieres, two provocative dance pieces, and a web-series available online. Now, we've relocated to New York City and are launching two world premieres back-to-back.</p>
<h3>Where we're at:</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The Bellwether Project is lucky enough to have been offered slots in two highly selective festivals this June. One of the projects is a futuristic beauty pageant with a dark secret, and the other is an experimental exploration/celebration of the relationships between mothers and daughters. While we're receiving some technical support from these festivals, we need help in covering the production costs of both World Premieres, and in fairly compensating all of the artists involved.</p>
<h3>Why it matters:</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">With your help, we will be able to launch our company in the highly competitive environment of New York City. Given the size and audience of both of these festivals, we are in an exciting position to use these opportunities to make relationships with larger theatre companies and producers, who can help us take our work to the next level. Our goal is also to engage more artists in thought-provoking work and reach more audiences with compelling, untold stories. Your contributions are the key to achieving that goal, and we grateful for anything that you would be willing to give.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We are seeking $8,000 total, split evenly between both of our World Premiere productions.<br/>These funds will be put toward production costs, like costumes and scenic pieces that will enhance the artistic quality of the pieces, as well as rehearsal space that will give our actors and directors a place to craft the story.<br/><br/>The funds will also go toward paying the team of artists for each piece. The theatrical community of NYC is often taking advantage of young artists by asking them to work for free.

<p>Both of these productions are fulfilling our mission to share untold stories with the world. So often, the narratives we hear in everyday life are one-sided and limited.

<p>We have launched 3 world premieres, two dance pieces, and a web-series in the 4 years that we've been a company. We traveled to World War II USSR and met the first all-female regiment in military history, we created a time-traveling immersive dance club from multiple eras of the 20th century, and we met the children of undocumented immigrants living in fear in modern-day America.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">-- Walt Whitman, Song of the Open Road</p>
<p>Dear friends, loved ones and future friends,</p>
<p>We've made theatre in laundry rooms, in attics, in back yards, living rooms, theatres in Athens and theaters in Brooklyn, pubs in London, barns in Maine, studios in universities and museums in North Carolina. And on Skype. What we've been trying to figure out is how to stay together when we're not together geographically. And when we <i>are</i> together, how does our traveling together change us. Change our work, our process and our relationships with the audiences we meet along the way. </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/260704878?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p>With each journey on the road, we get better. Better at being an ensemble. Better at listening to each other, better at listening to the audience. Better at sharing and understanding why we do what we do. Every audience in every town and city we visit offers us a new perspective. And makes us work harder to find that ease of trust and human connection. And to find more love. </p>
<p><strong>THE OUT WEST TOUR </strong>| Summer 2018</p>
<p>We are working on an original play called <i>Come Out of the Storm</i> inspired by Shakespeare’s King Lear. Last year, we toured our 2-man <i>Antony &amp; Cleopatra</i> along the East Coast and touched hearts in places of the world we least expected. We saw how our work affected people where such theatre as we make often isn’t available. </p>
<p>For summer 2018, the west is summoning us. Our plan is to make a 2-week road trip tour, beginning in Cold Spring, NY and drive to Boise, ID and back. Stopping along the way to share our shows. We are plotting our journey as this campaign launches. New Orleans, Kansas, Montana, California...it's a long list.</p>
<p>We’ve always shared our plays directly with people who were willing to listen. We don’t like to filter anything we do and we think that we have something worth sharing and <strong>we want to give it away</strong> to as many people as we can.</p>
<p>As a fully nomadic company at heart and in structure, it’s just the three of us. Making theatre that is unique and truthful and that we know people respond to.</p>
<p>How far we get out West depends on how much money we raise. We are currently contacting theaters and friends and are welcoming invitations to perform where you are. Contact us and let's work out how we can perform where you are on our Out West tour! Both<strong> ANTONY &amp; CLEOPATRA </strong>and/or<strong> COME OUT OF THE STORM </strong>are available.</p>

<p><strong>WHAT YOUR SUPPORT MEANS TO US</strong></p>
<p>We've never made a profit on any of our shows, usually offering our shows for free or through donations. We've never rented a theater space, having been fortunate in the generosity of strangers and friends. We'd like to continue with that model on our Out West tour. <strong>Our goal is to raise $5000</strong> to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>TRAVEL. This is our primary cost. For our previous tours, we've mostly been able to fund it ourselves with our own resources and through the generosity of those who have invited us to their homes and theaters. But this is an ambitious adventure.<ul>
<li>Ronald's air travel to and from the Czech Republic and the United States</li>
<li>Gas, food, lodging (as needed) for 2 weeks as we drive from Cold Spring, NY to Boise, Idaho, stopping along the way out and back to share our shows.</li>

-- Walt Whitman, Song of the Open Road
Dear friends, loved ones and future friends,
We've made theatre in laundry rooms, in attics, in back yards, living rooms, theatres in Athens and theaters in Brooklyn, pubs in London, barns in Maine, studios in universities and museums in North Carolina. And on Skype. What we've been trying to figure out is how to stay together when we're not together geographically. And when we are together, how does our traveling together change us. Change our work, our process and our relationships with the audiences we meet along the way. 

 
With each journey on the road, we get better. Better at being an ensemble. Better at listening to each other, better at listening to the audience. Better at sharing and understanding why we do what we do. Every audience in every town and city we visit offers us a new perspective. And makes us work harder to find that ease of trust and human connection. And to find more love. 
THE OUT WEST TOUR | Summer 2018
We are working on an original play called Come Out of the Storm inspired by Shakespeare’s King Lear. Last year, we toured our 2-man Antony & Cleopatra along the East Coast and touched hearts in places of the world we least expected. We saw how our work affected people where such theatre as we make often isn’t available. 
For summer 2018, the west is summoning us. Our plan is to make a 2-week road trip tour, beginning in Cold Spring, NY and drive to Boise, ID and back. Stopping along the way to share our shows. We are plotting our journey as this campaign launches. New Orleans, Kansas, Montana, California...it's a long list.
We’ve always shared our plays directly with people who were willing to listen. We don’t like to filter anything we do and we think that we have something worth sharing and we want to give it away to as many people as we can.
As a fully nomadic company at heart and in structure, it’s just the three of us. Making theatre that is unique and truthful and that we know people respond to.
How far we get out West depends on how much money we raise. We are currently contacting theaters and friends and are welcoming invitations to perform where you are. Contact us and let's work out how we can perform where you are on our Out West tour! Both ANTONY & CLEOPATRA and/or COME OUT OF THE STORM are available.

WHAT YOUR SUPPORT MEANS TO US
We've never made a profit on any of our shows, usually offering our shows for free or through donations. We've never rented a theater space, having been fortunate in the generosity of strangers and friends. We'd like to continue with that model on our Out West tour. Our goal is to raise $5000 to cover:

TRAVEL. This is our primary cost. For our previous tours, we've mostly been able to fund it ourselves with our own resources and through the generosity of those who have invited us to their homes and theaters. But this is an ambitious adventure.
Ronald's air travel to and from the Czech Republic and the United States
Gas, food, lodging (as needed) for 2 weeks as we drive from Cold Spring, NY to Boise, Idaho, stopping along the way out and back to share our shows.


PRODUCTION COSTS - We have little to no production overhead as our aesthetic does not rely on elaborate props, sets, costumes. It's just us up there, creating the atmosphere with our bodies, our own music, sharing our story with the audience. But we might need a few things for our productions, like Luke's been wearing the same costume pants for 3 years, he could use a new pair.

WHAT WE HOPE YOU GET FROM THIS

Your contribution will be reflected in audiences’ appreciation across the width of the US. 
Think of us as a messenger from Shakespeare’s plays: delivering what you value to people you may never have the chance to meet face to face, through the theatre we make.
We will be documenting our journey in a travel log that you can follow along with!
We have some perks, too. 


If you know someone who has a theater, a backyard, a living room who'd like to see our shows, we'd love to talk to them, put us in touch!  Contact Colleen at colleen@duomuzi.com.
Thank you for believing in us. Thank you for your generosity. 
See you on the road.

<p><strong>QUI SOMMES-NOUS?</strong></p>
<p>CréActifs est une compagnie de théâtre qui a émergé du constat que l’aspect « production » est souvent absent des activités culturelles de loisirs. Notre approche part du principe que c’est à travers le regard d’un public que l’acte créateur prend véritablement son sens et devient ainsi un acquis réel pour le participant. Pour cette raison, nous investissons les fonds que nous recevons envers la location d’une salle et la création de décors et costumes. Le mandat de CréActifs est d’être ouvert à tout participant en quête de créativité et de leur donner les outils, la structure et le support nécessaires pour nourrir celle-ci, non seulement à travers l’acquisition de « compétences » artistiques, mais, aussi et surtout, en développant un sentiment d’accomplissement par l’aboutissement d’un projet complet. Notre mission est de créer des productions communautaires inclusives et immersives qui valorisent les talents de chacun et utilisent les ressources disponibles. Cette dernière année, Julien a passé le flambeau de la production à Anne-Marie St-Louis, une jeune metteure en scène émergente dans le domaine du théâtre d’intervention. En tant qu'artiste menant ce projet, les objectifs personnels d’Anne-Marie sont de déconstruire les notions préconçues de représentation, de culture et d’identité et de s’investir dans les communautés défavorisées. Elle conçoit la performance comme un acte de revendication  puissant et poétique qui se doit d'engager le spectateur directement et de provoquer la réflexion. </p>

<p>Après une fructueuse résidence artistique en campagne ainsi que des mois de répétitions, de recherche et d’écriture CréActifs présentera <i>Le meilleur des mondes </i>du 26 au 28 janvier 2017.

<h3><u>What is SURVIVOR STORY, and Our Goals</u></h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise money to workshop a musical that will spread awareness of sexual assault and rape.

We plan to develop the musical more this workshop and mount a full production in 2018.</p>

<h3><u>Why This Project is Important</u></h3>
<p>We hope that by sharing this story it will empower victims to recognize they are survivors and will share their story in order to continue our theme of 'you/they are not alone'.  By providing awareness and connection we hope that the existing statistics of victims will change and that survivors will actively seek out ways to educate and enlighten individuals just how big of an issue sexual assault and rape are today.</p>

<p>Born in Russia in 1986, <b>Yuli Kovbasnian</b> immigrated to Israel in 2001 and holds a Bachelor of Education in dance from Seminar Hakibutzim College. She was a dancer in Arkadi Zaides piece <i>Land-Research</i>, which premiered at Fabric Potsdam in May 2012. Since then, Yuli has collaborated with various choreographers from Israel and abroad. In May 2013, she presented a solo work, <i>State of Matter</i> at Driven Festival for Contemporary Dance. Yuli is currently studying towards an M.A. in Gender Studies at Tel-Aviv University. In 2013 Yuli was awarded the danceWEB scholarship at ImPulsTanz Vienna International Dance Festival. Currently, Yuli collaborates with Swiss visual artist Celine Manz on the project <i>Online</i>, a Skype-based collaboration that fuses their two disciplines.</p>

<p><b>Julia Gladstone</b> is a movement, video, and visual artist from Massachusetts. Her work takes interest in locating the animation of the artificial, and the inorganic within the living. She has collaborated on multi-media projects with many artists internationally. Most recently, Julia performed in <i>D21</i> choreographed by Yuli Kovbasnian and <i>The Multiple</i> choreographed by Aretha Aoki. She premiered her new solo work <i>1 1/2</i> at a Workbench showing in Northampton, MA, and her most recent work, <i>CLUB TROPICANA</i>, was developed through the Choreographic Module at Ponderosa. As a dance videographer, she has worked for Jacob's Pillow, Bates Dance Festival, and Ponderosa, and received her Bachelor of Arts from Hampshire College in 2012.

<i>All Pathologies</i>,<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Concept and Methods</span>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>We propose to choreograph a duet movement performance during this residency. Expanding upon the performative research methods that we have generated together in past projects <i>D21</i> and <i>CLUB TROPICANA</i>, which centered around alienation and abandonment respectively, we will devise a new work catalyzing from the concept of ""pathology.""</p>
<p>Pathology, defined as a mental, social, or physical malfunction, or the typical behavior of a disease, is also a compound of the terms pathos and logos. If pathos speaks to the world of emotion and logos to the creation of order, we are interested in pursuing pathology as ""the choreography of emotion"". </p>
<p>We are attempting to inhabit the interior of relationship structures without becoming subjects. Through subtle body language and ecstatic quirks, we unleash and arrange the repressed contents of the psychic body. Our work lies in this task of embodying state, emotion, and relationship without becoming human. What happens when we exceed the body or articulate only a microscopic part? How might a memory relate to a piece of bacteria, an emotion to an organ? We must design the codes of conduct.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from choreographic structures of disease patterns and the logics of infection and mental illness, we will research new architectures of interaction through which to reveal both order and chaos, alienation and inclusion, intimacy and abandon.</p>
<p>As we have done in our past collaborations, we will gather improvised movement material from original scores, and then arrange, cut up, infect, disturb, cradle and poison it until it becomes resonant.<br/><br/><b>A NOTE OF APPRECIATION: </b>This project originates from a history of important performative research this past August with a group of amazing performers and collaborators who will remain with us energetically in this work, and physically in future collaborations. Endless nods go to the members of <i>CLUB TROPICANA</i>: Yoav Admoni, Mor Demer, and Micheál Rowsome. And to the members of <i>D21</i>: Caitlin Hafer and Monika Smekot. An enormous THANK YOU for the dramaturgical support of Jassem Hindi, Stephanie Maher, and Maria F. Scaroni.

<h3>A Contested Site<br/>
</h3>We feel that our artistic research into the structures of alienation and pathology carries particular resonance in the complex political climate of the Near East region in Israel. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is characterized by violence regarding the limits and borders of Palestinian and Israeli bodies and identities; the politics of belonging pose literal physical crises. The concept of statehood can be seen as an attempt to make solid a complete body, rendering those outside the state incomplete, pathologic, and alien. The negotiation of and extreme violence over territory throws into question the possibility of closure and brings to fore essential questions about home and humanity.<br/><br/>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Recognizing the serious dangers that Palestinians and Israelis are faced with in the heat of conflict, we are planning to spend time listening deeply to the experiences of people affected by violence, and to bring that listening directly into the conditions of our studio practice. <br/><br/></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><h3>The Importance of Experimental Movement Performance<br/>
</h3></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Art provides a reflective and resonant space where invented rules, logics, and values have space to breathe new possibilities back into ""reality."" Within our artistic practice, we play, question, and imagine the possibility of things operating differently.

As the artists of this project, we are not proposing to solve anything, nor are we telling you that we could ever really ""understand"" another person's experience. Instead, we will attempt to listen deeply and to explore the space of partiality. We believe that the methods, techniques, and practices of performance are ones that work to engage critically, swim in the unknown, imagine change, and question the conditions of being present together.<br/><br/></span></div><div>
<h3>A Lack of Funding &lt;&gt; Hope For the Future<br/>
</h3>
<div>The sustainability of experimental dance is in danger today due to a lack of funding. We believe that there is immense value in the medium of live movement performance. However, because dance doesn't result in commodifiable or easily reproducible objects, but instead takes the form of fleeting physical languages, it has suffered from a lack of legibility, scholarship, and funding. <br/><b style=""background-color: initial;"">WE REALLY NEED YOUR HELP </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">to sustain, validate, and support the value of live movement performance!</span>

As the artists of this project, we are not proposing to solve anything, nor are we telling you that we could ever really ""understand"" another person's experience. Instead, we will attempt to listen deeply and to explore the space of partiality. We believe that the methods, techniques, and practices of performance are ones that work to engage critically, swim in the unknown, imagine change, and question the conditions of being present together.
A Lack of Funding <> Hope For the Future

The sustainability of experimental dance is in danger today due to a lack of funding. We believe that there is immense value in the medium of live movement performance. However, because dance doesn't result in commodifiable or easily reproducible objects, but instead takes the form of fleeting physical languages, it has suffered from a lack of legibility, scholarship, and funding. WE REALLY NEED YOUR HELP to sustain, validate, and support the value of live movement performance!




  What We Need & What You Get
 We are hoping to raise $2,200 to cover the costs of travel to and from Tel Aviv and to rent a shared room in the city during the month-long residency period. If there are any remaining funds, that money will go directly towards costumes, set, props, promotion, and photography.

</h3> <p></p>
<p>After spending a month training with the renowned SITI Company
in Saratoga Springs, NY, Jeffrey Pufahl and Eva Barrie ventured down to Central
Park to celebrate Canada Day.  Amidst the
lack of Canadian celebrations they began discussing how wonderful it would be
to bring their shared training and collaborative theatre philosophy back to Canada.  Jeff then hurried off to Saskatchewan, while
Eva settled back into Toronto and the two began exchanging ideas of what play
would excite and challenge them most.  Upon
finding <i>Melancholy Play</i>, their minds
were made up.  </p>
<p>Eva then called upon the producing powers of Edward Hillier,
the Artistic Director of The Empty Room (<i>Journey’s
End, Under Milk Wood</i>) who immediately fell in love with the play.  Through a Skype meeting with members calling in
from Canada, England and Mexico, the decision to take on this bold play was
made.</p>

</div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Project</h3>
<p><i>Melancholy Play</i> will be a play like no other.  We are a mix of emerging and established

<p><b>Set pieces</b>: Flicker will be a bare-bones production, but even with as much elimination as we have done already, we still need a few set pieces in order to convey our setting as realistically as possible.</p>
<p><b>Travel expenses</b>: Several of our actors are traveling from out of town because they are <i>just that dedicated</i> to this show. We would like to compensate them for all of that gas money that's currently coming right out of their own pockets!</p>
<p><b>Marketing</b>: Each Kansas City Fringe Festival production is responsible for their own marketing platforms.

But having this many shows to see can come at a cost: some shows simply get lost in the shuffle. Even by simply considering a contribution to our show means that you are one more person who knows about us.</p>
<p>We are also determined to stage more realistic stories. There are many shows that contribute to great LGBT representation, and each one of them is important. What makes Flicker different is that the characters' homosexuality actually has nothing to do with the challenges they come across in this piece. We hope to help all audience members relate to LGBT struggles by showing them that most challenges in love are the same regardless of sexual preferences.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other ways you can help.</h3> <p>We understand that not everyone is able to contribute financially, and that's okay! We hope our passion for this show has inspired you, so here are other ways you can help:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word! By sharing our campaign with others, we may reach our goal because more people are aware of it!</li>

Travel expenses: Several of our actors are traveling from out of town because they are just that dedicated to this show. We would like to compensate them for all of that gas money that's currently coming right out of their own pockets!
Marketing: Each Kansas City Fringe Festival production is responsible for their own marketing platforms. Facebook and other social media marketing can take us a long way, but we want everyone to know about our show! Posters and postcards placed in local Kansas City businesses can take us so much farther!
    The impact you will have. The Kansas City metro has a magnificent, booming theatrical community. This cannot be understated! But having this many shows to see can come at a cost: some shows simply get lost in the shuffle. Even by simply considering a contribution to our show means that you are one more person who knows about us.
We are also determined to stage more realistic stories. There are many shows that contribute to great LGBT representation, and each one of them is important. What makes Flicker different is that the characters' homosexuality actually has nothing to do with the challenges they come across in this piece. We hope to help all audience members relate to LGBT struggles by showing them that most challenges in love are the same regardless of sexual preferences.

    Other ways you can help. We understand that not everyone is able to contribute financially, and that's okay! We hope our passion for this show has inspired you, so here are other ways you can help:


Spread the word! By sharing our campaign with others, we may reach our goal because more people are aware of it!
If you think you might have props or set pieces that you'd be willing to lend (or give!) to us, email us at flicker.fringe@gmail.com

Have a large rehearsal space we can use? Email us!
Finally, COME TO OUR SHOW! This is the absolute BEST way you can support us! Details are on our event Facebook page: Flicker Facebook Event Page

<h3>What is Little Women?</h3>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Based on Louisa May Alcott's classic 1869 semi-autobiographical novel, it focuses on the four March sisters — brassy, tomboy-like, aspiring writer Jo, romantic Meg, pretentious Amy, and kind-hearted Beth — and their beloved Marmee, at home in Concord, Massachusetts while the family patriarch is away serving as a Union Army Chaplain during the Civil War. Intercut with the vignettes in which their lives unfold are several recreations of the melodramatic short stories Jo writes in her attic studio.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<p><b>Why Little Women?</b></p>
<div></div>
<p>Little Women is the thrilling story of a girl defying society and gender norms in order to pursue her dreams and create a better life for her and her sisters. We are reminded of the importance of individuality and believing in oneself while simultaneously contemplating the meaning of family in our own lives. As we go through college, we constantly question the journey ahead of us. This musical invites us to create our own paths and to follow them no matter how daunting the odds. </p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>MTR is run exclusively by USC students. Thus, we receive no outside support from faculty or professional companies.  Because our company is entirely student-run, every one of us puts in an enormous amount of time and effort in order to bring each of our productions to life. That being said, our financial resources are limited and we need help raising money for our production designers.  Funds we raise will be used for lighting, set, props, sound, and costumes. These design elements are vital not only in helping our production reach its full potential but also in providing design students with valuable production opportunities.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This campaign will drastically increase the caliber of our performance! We are so grateful for all the support we have received in the past. MTR has been producing musicals for and by the students for two decades now.

<p><b>DEM</b> is a new experimental play by Fulya Peker that will premiere in 2016, in Istanbul (and may get to NY after). It questions the dynamics of oppression and resistance, existence and survival from a procreative point of view. Imagine that you are only allowed to breathe every 30 seconds; imagine that any form of expression and communication that requires rapid respiration is banned such as to be afraid, to get angry, to laugh, to cry, to have sex; and imagine that the punishment of disobedience is death. How would you survive? How would you express yourself? How would you give birth to a form of language through which you can communicate with a forbidden future? How would you impregnate your self to create anew?<b> </b></p><p><b></b></p><b>KATHARSIS PERFORMANCE PROJECT </b>is a New York and Istanbul based theater project founded by Fulya Peker in 2007. With its plays KPP tries to create metaphorical analogies between physiology and existential philosophy; to explore ecstatic states of human consciousness (fear, sexuality, cruelty) through new forms of textual, physical and vocal expressions while focusing on the relation between taboo and transgression; to experiment on the primal sensory connotations of language; and to invite the audience to a poetic and cathartic experience. Katharsis Performance Project is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. <div>

<br/><p><b>A letter from Fulya Peker</b></p>
<p>Dear friends, strangers, observers and witnesses,</p>
<p>As some of you may know, after living in NY as a theater
artist for twelve years, with the impact of recent Gezi resistance in Turkey, I
decided to go back, to experience and to share the agony caused by the current oppressive government in my homeland. The pain is intense here in this side of the world. Death is everyday, everywhere. It gets harder and harder to stand up and resist against the current political destruction. Today is history! The framework through which future generations will perceive today is being constructed at the moment. I think, art carries a major responsibility to keep a record of the moment, to remember the muted screams, to create awareness about the ways in which authorities construct social codes; and to hold on to the possibility of creating a new. Sometimes metaphors may reveal the most avoided truths. Maybe not today, but tomorrow.</p>
<p>In 2016, in Istanbul, I want to engrave my experiences and
feelings about the moment on experimental stage, once again, this time in my mother-tongue. My new play is
called DEM, which means blood, breath and moment in Turkish. It will be
directed and performed by me and presented by Katharsis Performance Project. The
money raised during this campaign will be used solely for rehearsal and performance space rental, set design and marketing expenses. </p>
<p>To be able to construct DEM, I need your support. This time
more than ever. </p>
<p>No matter where you are in the world, to be a part of this experience all you need to do is to choose an amount and proceed with your banking card or via paypal. If you cannot donate now, you can always help spread the word...</p>

<p>Our beloved Arturo Galster has passed away.<b> 
</b>We are committed to honor his legacy, life, and work in an event fit
for royalty.  On Monday September
22, at 7:30pm, we will be holding <b>“A Celebration of the Life of Arturo Galster”</b>
at the Castro Movie Palace in San Francisco.  </p>
<p>The evening will be a multimedia celebration of all stages
of Arturo’s life and work, including song, dance, visual art, video, film and
photography. </p>
<p>The event is <b>FREE</b>
and open to the public. </p>
<p>All Indiegogo funds will be used to cover theater operating
costs, as well as all other production expenses.</p>
<p>Our goal of $5,000 will ensure a memorable celebration for

after that goal will go to a charity close to Arturo, in his name.  </p>

to his friends and loved ones as <b>Arturo</b>)
on May 7, 1959, Mr. Galster was raised in Philadelphia, where
he began performing in musicals while in high school. He moved to the Bay Area
in 1978 and enrolled at the SF Art Institute, which he
attended for 4 years.</p>
<p>By the early '80s, Mr. Galster
was a rising star in the city's drag cabaret and theater world, a leader in
what's been described as a new wave of ironic camp performance. Besides his iconic
cabaret work as Patsy Cline, he created tribute performances to Marlene Dietrich and to Chet Baker, in the guise of
the jazz musician's fictitious widow, Chesty Baker.</p>
<p>In 1986, he moved to Japan
for four years, where he studied Japanese and traditional kyogen and kabuki
theater. In recent years he was an active participant in hula studies and
supporter of the preservation of traditional Hawaiian culture, as well as an
enthusiastic Airbnb host.</p>
<p>Arturo
Galster appeared in plays, musicals, cabaret shows and films in the USA and
several other countries from the early 1980s until his death in 2014. He
appeared in two cult drag films: as Noodles Nebula in <i>Vegas in Space</i> (Troma Entertainment, 1991) and as Patsy Cline in <i>Virtue II</i> (Margin Films, 1999). In
addition, he appeared as a drag-queen streetwalker named Fabrege in “Javelin
Catcher,” a 1996 episode of the television series <i>Nash Bridges</i>.</p>
<p>Onstage
in San Francisco, Galster performed in a many high-profile and often high-camp
theatrical productions that epitomized the city’s renowned queer culture from
the mid-1980s on. Among his stage turns were roles in <i>Naked Brunch</i>, <i>Phillip R.
Ford’s Dolls</i>, <i>Christmas With the
Crawfords</i>, <i>Eve</i>, <i>Dirty Little Showtunes</i>, <i>Naked Boys Singing</i>, <i>Half-a-Dozen Dorothies</i>, <i>Lavender
Lockerroom</i>, <i>Stale Magnolias</i>, <i>Simply Stunning: The Doris Fish Story</i>, <i>Scalpel! The Musical</i>, <i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</i> and <i>Pearls Over Shanghai.</i></p>
<p>From
1982 to 1989, Galster toured every summer as the incarnation of country music
superstar Patsy Cline accompanied by a tribute band dubbed the Memphis G-Spots.
The act appeared at nightclubs in Atlanta, Dallas, LA, Miami, New Orleans, NYC and
SF, as well as London and Tokyo.</p>
<p>From
1995 to 2012, Galster was a regular performer in shows presented by impresario
Marc Huestis at the Castro Theatre that brought together camp and classic films
with appearances by stars of the movies accompanied by drag tribute shows.
Galster performed in 15 of the productions, singing live in such personas as
Conrad Birdie from <i>Bye Bye Birdie</i>,
Endorra from <i>Bewitched</i> and Tim Gunn
from <i>Project Runway.</i></p>
<p>Galster
also performed in a number of San Francisco’s noted queer nightclubs of the
1990s and 2000s, including Klubstitute, Dragstrip at the DNA Lounge and
Trannyshack.</p>
<p>At
various points in his career, Galster worked administrative jobs to supplement
his theatrical work, most recently at Theatre ZinZanni and the Immune

We are committed to honor his legacy, life, and work in an event fit
for royalty.  On Monday September
22, at 7:30pm, we will be holding “A Celebration of the Life of Arturo Galster”
at the Castro Movie Palace in San Francisco.  
The evening will be a multimedia celebration of all stages
of Arturo’s life and work, including song, dance, visual art, video, film and
photography. 
The event is FREE
and open to the public. 
All Indiegogo funds will be used to cover theater operating
costs, as well as all other production expenses.
Our goal of $5,000 will ensure a memorable celebration for
Arturo.  All funds raised
after that goal will go to a charity close to Arturo, in his name.  
Thank you for your kindness and generosity.
Born Arthur Francis Galster (known
to his friends and loved ones as Arturo)
on May 7, 1959, Mr. Galster was raised in Philadelphia, where
he began performing in musicals while in high school. He moved to the Bay Area
in 1978 and enrolled at the SF Art Institute, which he
attended for 4 years.
By the early '80s, Mr. Galster
was a rising star in the city's drag cabaret and theater world, a leader in
what's been described as a new wave of ironic camp performance. Besides his iconic
cabaret work as Patsy Cline, he created tribute performances to Marlene Dietrich and to Chet Baker, in the guise of
the jazz musician's fictitious widow, Chesty Baker.
In 1986, he moved to Japan
for four years, where he studied Japanese and traditional kyogen and kabuki
theater. In recent years he was an active participant in hula studies and
supporter of the preservation of traditional Hawaiian culture, as well as an
enthusiastic Airbnb host.
Arturo
Galster appeared in plays, musicals, cabaret shows and films in the USA and
several other countries from the early 1980s until his death in 2014. He
appeared in two cult drag films: as Noodles Nebula in Vegas in Space (Troma Entertainment, 1991) and as Patsy Cline in Virtue II (Margin Films, 1999). In
addition, he appeared as a drag-queen streetwalker named Fabrege in “Javelin
Catcher,” a 1996 episode of the television series Nash Bridges.
Onstage
in San Francisco, Galster performed in a many high-profile and often high-camp
theatrical productions that epitomized the city’s renowned queer culture from
the mid-1980s on. Among his stage turns were roles in Naked Brunch, Phillip R.
Ford’s Dolls, Christmas With the
Crawfords, Eve, Dirty Little Showtunes, Naked Boys Singing, Half-a-Dozen Dorothies, Lavender
Lockerroom, Stale Magnolias, Simply Stunning: The Doris Fish Story, Scalpel! The Musical, Hedwig and the Angry Inch and Pearls Over Shanghai.
From
1982 to 1989, Galster toured every summer as the incarnation of country music
superstar Patsy Cline accompanied by a tribute band dubbed the Memphis G-Spots.
The act appeared at nightclubs in Atlanta, Dallas, LA, Miami, New Orleans, NYC and
SF, as well as London and Tokyo.
From
1995 to 2012, Galster was a regular performer in shows presented by impresario
Marc Huestis at the Castro Theatre that brought together camp and classic films
with appearances by stars of the movies accompanied by drag tribute shows.
Galster performed in 15 of the productions, singing live in such personas as
Conrad Birdie from Bye Bye Birdie,
Endorra from Bewitched and Tim Gunn
from Project Runway.
Galster
also performed in a number of San Francisco’s noted queer nightclubs of the
1990s and 2000s, including Klubstitute, Dragstrip at the DNA Lounge and
Trannyshack.
At
various points in his career, Galster worked administrative jobs to supplement
his theatrical work, most recently at Theatre ZinZanni and the Immune
Enhancement Project, both in San Francisco.

As my senior project here at SUNY Purchase, I am directing Jean-Claude van Itallie’s groundbreaking play Interview, an ensemble piece for eight actors. I am mounting this production in collaboration with a fantastic team of students from the Theatre & Performance and Theatre Design/Technology departments. 

It is our goal to present an outstanding piece of theatre that is so exciting because of how relevant it still is over fifty years after it was written. Jean-Claude van Itallie wrote about concerns that came out of what he was seeing around him in the face of technology, advertisement, and consumer culture. Performing this play now brings to light how these concerns are still relevant, perhaps even more so. 

What is this play about?
Interview doesn’t follow a clear plot line, opting instead for an extremely stylistic approach to a series of vignettes that fade into each other. The play offers snippets of everyday life written in a way that explores consumerism and acts as a social critique.
A section that stands out is one where a man speaks to his psychiatrist. He talks about how recently, he was watching television like any other night. As the commercials play, he begins to feel ill. He cannot figure out why, but suddenly he is throwing up. The commercials are making him sick, but beyond that, his slavery to them is the real catalyst. This is a play about people who are severely affected by media. They are obsessed with the impressions they think they are making on others and the societal rules they might not realize they are enforcing.
Where is the money going?
Though we are working hard to keep the costs of this production minimal, many expenses are inevitable. The school graciously allows us access to rehearsal and performance space, but everything else must come out of pocket. 
Our biggest expense is paint and materials for the set. We will be transforming the UnderGround theatre into a space conducive to movement while still fitting the aesthetic of the piece. We also must pay for the performance rights, which are owned by Dramatists Play Service, Inc. 
There are also a number of smaller costs that add up. Our stage management budget goes towards things like spike tape, binders, and a first aid kit.

<p>This fundraiser goes directly to support the talented artists performing in <i>My Only Option was SABOTAGE</i> , June 18-21st at the Red Eye Theater. I want to say that again, every single penny goes to these incredibly talented, hard working performers! </p>
<p>I am an emerging artist crafting my voice as a choreographer and in doing so received the production commission from the Red Eye to create this work. That means they gave me rehearsal space, performance space, a technical director to do lighting design, comprehensive promotional elements and feedback along the way to help me grow. Plus they gave me a little money which I've spent on costumes and our hundreds, yes hundreds of edible props. </p>
<p>I am so grateful to have received this support from the Red Eye Theater, however their support also comes from fundraisers and grants and they commissioned new works from nine artists. Now we need a greater pool of financial support for the performers who make it all possible. </p>
<p>This is a powerhouse cast of young artists, each of whom I've watched perform in other projects and companies and hand picked them for this piece because of their commitment, stage presence, improvisational background and ferocity. This project has been four and half years in the making, Kathleen Pender has been working with me four of those years and Emily Ban for two! This year I worked with Alexis for the first time with Alternative Motion Project when I set a new work on them and I knew she'd be a perfect fit for this ensemble. This is my first time working with Emma, Kimmie and Rush, but I've had my eye on them for awhile. I couldn't have more gratitude for all these dancers do to support my work. Please help me in supporting them. </p>

<p></p>
<p>Last year,
 Hannah Hauer-King and Kitty Wordsworth co-founded Damsel Productions 
with the key aim of producing new plays written by women. Last 
November, Damsel produced <i>Dry Land</i> at Jermyn Street Theatre, 
which was very well received
 by the critics. The Independent described it as “an auspicious debut 
for Damsel Productions, the ironically named and inspiring new company 
dedicated to putting provocative, true and honest aspects of female 
experience centre stage.” </p>
<p>It's an exciting prospect that the company's 
ethos seems to appeal to people, and we are beginning to garner some 
support in the industry. Of course, Damsel is just one small cog in a 
far greater movement towards gender equality in theatre,
 but it's an honour to be recognised as playing a small part in that 
movement. Hannah Hauer-King wrote an article in the Independent about 
why we do what we do: <a href=""http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/theatre-by-women-and-for-women-a-new-female-company-is-aiming-to-address-the-gender-imbalance-a6930731.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indy
 Article</a>.</p>
<p>Damsel has been given the incredible opportunity to produce a new play called <i>Fury</i>,
 showing at Soho Theatre 5-30 July 2015. The play, by talented emerging 
writer Phoebe Eclair-Powell, was shortlisted for the Verity Bargate 
Award
 and won the Soho Young Writers Award 2015. Hannah Hauer-King will 
direct.</p>
<span>
<p><i>Fury</i> is a chilling and powerful modern take on <i>Medea</i>,
 exploring motherhood, class and social culpability. With an all-seeing 
chorus, it takes an unapologetic look at the life of its fallible but 
fervent tragic hero, young
 single mum Sam - the kind of woman who is often judged before she's 
even opened her mouth.  <br/></p></span>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>
</h3> <p> </p>
<p></p>
<p>Damsel is committed to 
delivering the most honest and compelling production of this new play, 
and we hope its success will help us to continue with our work. As

 an emerging company we need all the support we can get, and we are 
currently in a position where your help in raising an extra £2,000 will 
be invaluably beneficial to Damsel in producing female-led productions 
now and in the future. Any amount, large or small,
 will make a significant impact.</p>

 you might be interested in, please email
