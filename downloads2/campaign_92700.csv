I know how much it meant to me when a customer would return to the market to tell me how much they appreciated the tomatoes they purchased the previous week, or that they had an appreciation for all time went into growing that ONE tomato, or described the delicious dish they created with the food I grew.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So, what about this raising awareness you ask? Why are our local markets so important? Let’s first take a look at the benefits to local economies and communities...For one, food tastes better. It is fresher and healthier, picked at the optimal harvest time, instead of at an unripe stage to ensure shipping quality. Decentralized food production (e.g. apples from various local farms as opposed to one huge apple factory farm) reduces food safety risks, as long distance travel has higher potential for contamination along it’s travel route. Keeping it local serves to bring consumers closer to the source, creating a personal relationship with the food and food producer. Doesn't it just feel better to be connected? Direct retail-to-consumer marketing is growing exponentially in the local food markets, and benefiting local communities by keeping dollars within that community. Local economies benefit from job creation from farms and farmer's markets. </span><br/></p>
<p>Keeping it local has some pretty awesome environmental benefits as well...Local farms have a tendency to adopt environmentally friendly practices more readily than larger factory farms. Often, smaller farms use less pesticides, rebuild their soils with cover crops and compost, and support greater crop and insect diversity. Waste products from large livestock feedlots are incredibly degrading to the environment. Localizing the meat market often replaces the feedlot with smaller, grass fed or pastured livestock production. Keeping food local saves an incredible amount of fossil fuels in by decreasing the amount of 'food miles' on your plate at each meal.  In fact, conventionally produced foods travel about 1,500 miles in the United states, which accounts for about 11 times more CO2 than locally produced food. Eating foods that are in season, organic and less processed reduce your carbon footprint, and no better place to find those items than your local farmer’s market!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433173223/ba5g6mkwpan5uwqtjctm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you are not in a position to contribute financially to the Upstate Terroir Project, there are many other ways you can get involved.

Com o privilégio de trabalhar com a mídia global, como a Petrolicious, tenho documentado os carros e histórias mais importantes da América Latina, como o projeto Torinos do Fangio ou o Pumas GT e vw sp2 Brasileros, para os novos museus chilenos dedicados ao automóvel ou engenhosidade do construtor de carros artesanais Badel na Colômbia e o que dizer sobre as paisagens da Bolívia em uma quimera TVR! para continuar com este trabalho eu criei este calendário nas 12 melhores fotografias selecionadas de 6 países durante um passeio combinado de 15.000 km.Com sua ajuda, poderei continuar a espalhar todas essas histórias latinas através de mídias globais como a Petrolicious, Octane, etc.    El calendario""Autos Clásicos en Latinoamérica"" Es un Calendario coleccionable que promociona a Latinoamérica como importante escenario entusiasta por los Autos clásicos, con fotografías en seis países de la región.La selección cuidadosa de fotografías comprende autos representativos de nuestra región como los IKA Torino 380w de Argentina, participantes en las 84 horas de Nürburgring y que marcaron un hito en la historia latina automotriz en las carreras europeas, el Volkswagen Sp2 o el Puma GT ingenios brasileños creados durante una época en la que no se permitía importar autos del extranjero, las rarezas europeas como la Bugatti 57tt ganadora de Autoclásica o el Renault 8 ex Emerson Fittipaldi en las Mil Millas Brasileras,  pasando por La Carrera Panamericana el rallye de clásicos más importante y exigente de Latinoamérica hasta la travesía Pub2pub de Ben Coombs en la que llegamos hasta el salar de Uyuni en un TVR mientras atravesamos Sudamérica en medio de su travesía polo a polo.A diferencia de un libro, un calendario estará más presente día a día en nuestras vidas durante un año, con ello quiero que conozcas y te apropies de nuestra región con todas esas gemas automovilísticas que un día marcaron la historia latina en torno a los autos clásicos, cada fotografía tiene una historia y de la cual puedes conocer más de cerca en los artículos que he escrito en Petrolicious https://petrolicious.com/author/alvaro-colombiano  o el Blog de mi pagina web www.andrespinzoom.comNo deja de sorprender todo lo que Latinoamérica tiene para ofrecer como escenario de esta pasión y de la que quiero empoderar la cultura y que nos apoyemos entre todos los hermanos latinos que activamente hacen parte de ella.Durante estos dos años he retratado historias Latinas en más de 32  artículos y publicaciones impresas alrededor del mundo como Petrolicious, Octane Magazine, Speedhunters, BBC News, Sputnik, Finansavisen, Zen Garaje entre otros. Producto de un trabajo de investigación de campo y exploración de la cultura en cada uno de los países de la región. Esto no habría sido posible sin la ayuda de todos esos amigos en cada país, familia y empresas que han aportado en esta loca idea. Comprando este Calendario contribuyes a que este sueño continúe con su misión de retratar y documentar los clásicos de nuestra tierra Latinoamericana.Especificaciones técnicasEl calendario de autos clásicos 2019 presenta un diseño auténtico el cual consta de un marco de 31x31 cm rígido a modo de recuadro con láminas intercambiables por mes.Son seis láminas con doce fotografías de autos representativos y auténticas rarezas en diferentes lugares y paisajes de 6 países de Latinoamérica. Impresas a doble cara, en litografía, papel de alta calidad de 300 gramos y aspecto Semi-brillante. En ella encuentras una fotografía junto con su descripción (auto, lugar y país) y calendario mensual.Todo el conjunto de recuadro y láminas se empacan cuidadosamente en una caja de cartón micro corrugado que lo protege para su embalaje. El presupuestoEste proyecto necesita recaudar $6.000 dólares; los cuales irán destinados a la impresión, diseño y producción. Si sobrepasamos la meta el recaudo excedente se usará para poder llegar a las diferentes regiones que sean necesarias documentar y difundir más contenido de la cultura latina en torno a los clásicos.Costos del material fotográfico:Para producir este material fotográfico requirió una tremenda inversión económica, tiempo e investigación para llegar a los diferentes países, parte de estos costos los cubrí vendiendo mi auto, escribiendo artículos, sumando préstamos de familiares y amigos. Riesgos y desafíosEl desafío más importante para el calendario son los tiempos de producción y entrega para ello cuento con la ayuda de Editorial Prince en la producción,  empresa experta en material impreso con más de 30 años de experiencia en el mercado.Otras formas en las que puedes ayudarSi de una u otra forma no puedes contribuir adquiriendo el calendario Autos clásicos en Latinoamérica 2019, puedes echarnos una mano compartiendo y difundiendo en grupos y redes sociales, agradecemos enormemente tu apoyo!",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

Esa pasión es una de las principales razones por las que viví durante un tiempo en Melbourne, para capturar en imágenes los paisajes increíbles que ofrecen Australia y Nueva Zelanda.</p><p>Actualmente viviendo en Europa, mi evolución como fotógrafo de paisajes me ha llevado a ofrecer parte de mi obra en una galería de arte ( <a href=""http://www.fiftydots.com/es/artists/id/oriol-morte"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FiftyDots</a> ) y hacer algunos trabajos como fotógrafo freelance. Desafortunadamente, ésta carrera fotográfica se ha visto interrumpida de repente. Mi objetivo es seguir haciendo fotos compartiendo lo que mejor sé hacer.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483136545/zzfoatetgszhihqyoz7i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>¿Qué pasó y por qué hago esta campaña?</h3><p>El pasado 31 de julio empecé un maravilloso viaje con mi amigo Héctor en su furgoneta Volkswagen. El objetivo del viaje era fotografiar Escocia conduciendo desde Barcelona hasta el extremo norte de Escocia. Fue un viaje increíble donde estuvimos en sitios realmente únicos y maravillosos.</p><p>Durante el regreso ya en Francia, en la última noche de nuestro viaje, paramos a dormir en una área de servicio cerca de Clermond-Ferrand después de un larguísimo día de viaje. Nos pusimos a dormir en la parte superior de la furgoneta, desplegando su techo abatible y cuando despertamos por la madrugada para seguir el viaje y llegar a casa, <strong>sentí lo peor que le puede pasar a un fotógrafo</strong>. Todo el equipo fotográfico que llevaba había desaparecido. Mientras dormíamos forzaron la cerradura sigilosamente y entraron rápidamente en la furgoneta para robar todo lo que estaba a su alcance. <strong>Me r</strong><strong>obaron unos 13.000€ en material fotográfico</strong>.</p><p>Después de presentar la denuncia a la policía y regresar a Barcelona, a fecha de hoy y después de muchas gestiones, correos y llamadas, ni el seguro del coche, ni de hogar ni de las tarjetas de crédito me permite recuperar un euro del material robado. Tampoco hay noticias del material.</p><p>Afortunadamente, no hay que lamentar daños físicos y no me pudieron robar lo más valioso, la pasión por la fotografía y todo lo que he aprendido en más de 15 años.</p><p><strong>Actualmente ya he financiado con un crédito a 2 años para volver a empezar otra vez, una cámara y dos objetivos. Lejos de cubrir todo lo que se llevaron y con muchos sacrificios y renuncias detrás, es un pequeño paso para</strong><strong> volver a compartir todas esas cosas preciosas que hay en el mundo</strong>.</p><p>Si queréis saber más sobre <a href=""http://www.oriolmorte.com/2017/01/01/robado-el-peor-viaje-fotografico-de-mi-vida/?lang=es"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cómo ocurrió el robo, entrad al artículo que he publicado en mi blog</a>.</p><p> </p><h3>¿Qué aportaciones puedes hacer y qué puedes obtener a cambio?</h3><p>A continuación os ofrezco las distintas aportaciones que podéis hacer a la campaña. Con los beneficios de la campaña me ayudará a financiar una parte de las herramientas que me permitían sacar las fotografías que hacía.

Landscape, portrait and performances have been the main topics that I focused on photography. This passion is one of the main reasons why I had been living in Melbourne for a while, in order to capture beautiful landscape imagery that both Australia and New Zealand offers.</p><p>Currently living in Europe, my evolution as a landscape photographer helped me to show and sell part of my work through an art gallery (FiftyDots) and also being hired for a number of photography assignments as a freelance photographer. Unfortunately, this photography career has been suddenly stopped. My main goal is taking pictures back again and keep sharing what I do best.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483136578/n6fp3qo4o0jlsi77bmn6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>What happened and Why am I doing this campaign?</h3><p>Last July 31st I did start a beautiful journey in company of my friend Héctor and his Volkswagen van. The purpose of the trip was taking pictures and video from Scotland driving all the way up from Barcelona to the north of Scotland by road. It was an incredible trip where we passed through stunning and unique places.</p><p>During our way back to Barcelona, we spent our last night of the trip in the middle of France. Since we were already too tired to go on driving, we decided to overnight in a highway's service station's parking area near Clermond-Ferrand after a very long drive. We slept at the expandable roof of the van. When we woke up very early in the morning in order to keep driving and get home, <strong>I had the worst too-real nightmare a photographer could ever feel. </strong>Whilst we were sleeping, someone did break the van's lock silently and broke in. They got almost everything they found worthy including almost all my photography equipment. <strong>They stole me 13.000€ worth of photography equipment.</strong></p><p>After reporting to police and getting back to Barcelona, some phone calls, emails and bureaucracy, none of the insurances worked for recovering a cent of my stolen equipment. No news either of the stolen equipment from police.</p><p>Fortunately, there was no personal damage and they couldn't steal what worths most: my passion and love for photography also everything that I learned over the last 15 years.</p><p><strong>I'm currently working hard and making big sacrifices in order to get back into photography again acquiring a camera and a couple of lenses through a 2-years credit. Everything focused on capture again all this beautiful things in the world.</strong></p><p>If you want any <a href=""http://www.oriolmorte.com/2017/01/01/stolen-the-worst-photo-trip-in-my-life/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">further information about the theft, visit my blog's article about it</a>.</p><p> </p><h3>What contributions can You do and what can You get in exchange?</h3><p>Ahead I do offer you  the different perks you can get in this campaign. The profit from this campaign will help me to get the tools I used to own that allowed me to take my best pictures. From my side, I'm already doing the biggest effort ever in order to begin again.</p><p>The best that a photographer can give is a piece of this beautiful passion. I have created a collection of perks for everyone's budget who wishes to contribute. From a 3€ perk up to 1200€'s.</p><p> </p><ul><li>

Esa pasión es una de las principales razones por las que viví durante un tiempo en Melbourne, para capturar en imágenes los paisajes increíbles que ofrecen Australia y Nueva Zelanda.Actualmente viviendo en Europa, mi evolución como fotógrafo de paisajes me ha llevado a ofrecer parte de mi obra en una galería de arte ( FiftyDots ) y hacer algunos trabajos como fotógrafo freelance. Desafortunadamente, ésta carrera fotográfica se ha visto interrumpida de repente. Mi objetivo es seguir haciendo fotos compartiendo lo que mejor sé hacer.  ¿Qué pasó y por qué hago esta campaña?El pasado 31 de julio empecé un maravilloso viaje con mi amigo Héctor en su furgoneta Volkswagen. El objetivo del viaje era fotografiar Escocia conduciendo desde Barcelona hasta el extremo norte de Escocia. Fue un viaje increíble donde estuvimos en sitios realmente únicos y maravillosos.Durante el regreso ya en Francia, en la última noche de nuestro viaje, paramos a dormir en una área de servicio cerca de Clermond-Ferrand después de un larguísimo día de viaje. Nos pusimos a dormir en la parte superior de la furgoneta, desplegando su techo abatible y cuando despertamos por la madrugada para seguir el viaje y llegar a casa, sentí lo peor que le puede pasar a un fotógrafo. Todo el equipo fotográfico que llevaba había desaparecido. Mientras dormíamos forzaron la cerradura sigilosamente y entraron rápidamente en la furgoneta para robar todo lo que estaba a su alcance. Me robaron unos 13.000€ en material fotográfico.Después de presentar la denuncia a la policía y regresar a Barcelona, a fecha de hoy y después de muchas gestiones, correos y llamadas, ni el seguro del coche, ni de hogar ni de las tarjetas de crédito me permite recuperar un euro del material robado. Tampoco hay noticias del material.Afortunadamente, no hay que lamentar daños físicos y no me pudieron robar lo más valioso, la pasión por la fotografía y todo lo que he aprendido en más de 15 años.Actualmente ya he financiado con un crédito a 2 años para volver a empezar otra vez, una cámara y dos objetivos. Lejos de cubrir todo lo que se llevaron y con muchos sacrificios y renuncias detrás, es un pequeño paso para volver a compartir todas esas cosas preciosas que hay en el mundo.Si queréis saber más sobre cómo ocurrió el robo, entrad al artículo que he publicado en mi blog. ¿Qué aportaciones puedes hacer y qué puedes obtener a cambio?A continuación os ofrezco las distintas aportaciones que podéis hacer a la campaña. Con los beneficios de la campaña me ayudará a financiar una parte de las herramientas que me permitían sacar las fotografías que hacía. Personalmente ya estoy haciendo todos los esfuerzos para tener pronto una cámara para volver a empezar.Lo mejor que un fotógrafo puede ofrecer es un trocito de esa pasión en forma de fotografía. He intentado crear una colección de contribuciones aptas para todos los bolsillos de quien quiera colaborar. Desde una aportación de 3€ hasta aportaciones de 1200€.

(Preguntas Más Frecuentes)¿Porqué no se pueden comprar las fotos con marco?

Landscape, portrait and performances have been the main topics that I focused on photography. This passion is one of the main reasons why I had been living in Melbourne for a while, in order to capture beautiful landscape imagery that both Australia and New Zealand offers.Currently living in Europe, my evolution as a landscape photographer helped me to show and sell part of my work through an art gallery (FiftyDots) and also being hired for a number of photography assignments as a freelance photographer. Unfortunately, this photography career has been suddenly stopped. My main goal is taking pictures back again and keep sharing what I do best.  What happened and Why am I doing this campaign?Last July 31st I did start a beautiful journey in company of my friend Héctor and his Volkswagen van. The purpose of the trip was taking pictures and video from Scotland driving all the way up from Barcelona to the north of Scotland by road. It was an incredible trip where we passed through stunning and unique places.During our way back to Barcelona, we spent our last night of the trip in the middle of France. Since we were already too tired to go on driving, we decided to overnight in a highway's service station's parking area near Clermond-Ferrand after a very long drive. We slept at the expandable roof of the van. When we woke up very early in the morning in order to keep driving and get home, I had the worst too-real nightmare a photographer could ever feel. Whilst we were sleeping, someone did break the van's lock silently and broke in. They got almost everything they found worthy including almost all my photography equipment. They stole me 13.000€ worth of photography equipment.After reporting to police and getting back to Barcelona, some phone calls, emails and bureaucracy, none of the insurances worked for recovering a cent of my stolen equipment. No news either of the stolen equipment from police.Fortunately, there was no personal damage and they couldn't steal what worths most: my passion and love for photography also everything that I learned over the last 15 years.I'm currently working hard and making big sacrifices in order to get back into photography again acquiring a camera and a couple of lenses through a 2-years credit. Everything focused on capture again all this beautiful things in the world.If you want any further information about the theft, visit my blog's article about it. What contributions can You do and what can You get in exchange?Ahead I do offer you  the different perks you can get in this campaign. The profit from this campaign will help me to get the tools I used to own that allowed me to take my best pictures. From my side, I'm already doing the biggest effort ever in order to begin again.The best that a photographer can give is a piece of this beautiful passion. I have created a collection of perks for everyone's budget who wishes to contribute. From a 3€ perk up to 1200€'s.

I received a second chance by receiving a kidney transplant. Then I’ve made a decision to life my live in a way that will contribute to positive changes in people’s hearts, minds and perceptions.</p><p>I’m a feminist. I see women not as a sexual object but as a form of art and as the goddess of creation. <strong>It’s my dream to make an exhibition and try to change the way society as a whole sees and perceives women, their bodies and souls.</strong> I want to change the norms of society that define what it is like to be a woman.</p><p><strong>To make this exhibition possible I need funds for the framing and printing of my photographs.</strong> So I decided to turn to you. I hope that you’ll like my work and support my mission. And if you do, I’m kindly asking you to fund it by purchasing one of the perks and help my dream come true in 2017.</p><h3><strong>What is The Freedom Project?</strong></h3><p>My series entitled ‘Freedom’ is a collection of 30 images, capturing intangible emotion through the physicality of both the body and its surroundings.</p><p>Each image is a study of a woman, exposed within her private space, where she is free to reveal her true, unrestrained self, for that sole moment unaffected by the constraints routinely imposed on her by societal restrictions. <strong>My photographs capture female nudity in its purest form - sensual, effortless, wild and above all else superior.</strong></p><p>In my work, I hope to move away from merely depicting the female body as a visually appealing and sexualized object. Rather,<strong> I strive to empower women and present them as independent individuals and the foundation of our society.​</strong> I see the nude, uninhibited body as the ultimate form of character expression, able to convey emotion in a single gesture. I view it further as capable of liberating both the sitter and the viewer, as their lived physical experiences inform each photograph I frame, continually placing it in a novel context.</p><p>I aim to reflect the ephemeral, archetypal timelessness of the female body and energy.

My photographic series entitled The Freedom Project strive to empower women. I wish to break away from many dogmas and stereotypes that have been built into our concept of community.I had a serious health condition several years ago. I received a second chance by receiving a kidney transplant. Then I’ve made a decision to life my live in a way that will contribute to positive changes in people’s hearts, minds and perceptions.I’m a feminist. I see women not as a sexual object but as a form of art and as the goddess of creation. It’s my dream to make an exhibition and try to change the way society as a whole sees and perceives women, their bodies and souls. I want to change the norms of society that define what it is like to be a woman.To make this exhibition possible I need funds for the framing and printing of my photographs. So I decided to turn to you. I hope that you’ll like my work and support my mission. And if you do, I’m kindly asking you to fund it by purchasing one of the perks and help my dream come true in 2017.What is The Freedom Project?My series entitled ‘Freedom’ is a collection of 30 images, capturing intangible emotion through the physicality of both the body and its surroundings.Each image is a study of a woman, exposed within her private space, where she is free to reveal her true, unrestrained self, for that sole moment unaffected by the constraints routinely imposed on her by societal restrictions. My photographs capture female nudity in its purest form - sensual, effortless, wild and above all else superior.In my work, I hope to move away from merely depicting the female body as a visually appealing and sexualized object. Rather, I strive to empower women and present them as independent individuals and the foundation of our society.​ I see the nude, uninhibited body as the ultimate form of character expression, able to convey emotion in a single gesture. I view it further as capable of liberating both the sitter and the viewer, as their lived physical experiences inform each photograph I frame, continually placing it in a novel context.I aim to reflect the ephemeral, archetypal timelessness of the female body and energy. Further, I wish to elevate my sitters both as women, in their cultural significance and role in society, and individuals, with their personal markers of strength, assertiveness, sensuality and playfulness. How Can You Help?In order to make the exhibition come true, I need funding to frame and print my photographs.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Matt Grayson and I'm the Editor of Steampunk Journal (<a href=""http://www.steampunkjournal.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.steampunkjournal.org</a>) which is currently the most popular online steampunk magazine in the World.</p>
<p>I grew up in Sheffield, UK and I took an interest in photography from an early age. In fact, I have over 20 years of experience. I can turn my hand to any type of photography, but my passion is portraiture.</p>
<p>My campaign is to raise funds to build a subscription based website by steampunks, for everyone interested in this amazing science fiction inspired by the 19th century aesthetic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479635570/hma0fxndwavuqv4upgx4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The Hellfire Club will feature galleries of photoshoots up to artistic nude level. They will have models of all genders in various situations that will always sport a steampunk or Victorian theme to them. Not being gender specific is something that hasn't been done before on a website like this and will reinforce the steampunk ethic of inclusivity. I will also look to take on shoots from steampunk photographers and steampunks from the community who wish to model.</p>
<p>Members will have to pay a monthly fee to access the site and all the shoots that are available to see in the gallery. Everyone involved in producing a shoot will get paid in some way.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480465434/zlm38mjnvcvbagisx5hx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>By contributing to the success of The Hellfire Club, you will be expanding a business that is already on the rise. My magazine, Steampunk Journal, is the most popular steampunk magazine in the world. I already have campaigns in place to help the community, such as Steampunk Write, Steampunk Read. It's designed to give independent authors some exposure of their novel right into the faces of the people that they want to read it. I champion supporting independent artists and always look to help them as much as possible. With an arm of the business bringing in finances, I can maintain the Journal as a free resource for steampunks and even expand to some other projects I've had to shelve due to costs.</p>
<p>I'm looking to raise £13,000 in order to fund the bulk of the outlay to get the Hellfire Club started. In order to have something for people to subscribe to, the site needs to have shoots accessible from the time of launch. I wouldn't be happy paying a monthly subscription for an empty website, so I can't expect anyone else to. I predict that having 20 shoots to upload will be good number with ten online at launch. That gives a buffer of another 10 shoots should I run into delays or other problems.</p>
<p>The cost of a single shoot is broken down typically into the following sections*:</p>
<p>Model hire £135</p>
<p>Make-up artist £180</p>
<p>Studio: £45</p>
<p>Clothing hire £50</p>
<p>Props travel costs £35</p>
<p>Retouching £205</p>
<p>Total: £650</p>
<p>*prices are for half a day shooting (approx 4 hours)</p>

<h3>Perks for investment</h3>
<p>The amount that you decide to contribute will determine the perks that you get and I've thought long and hard about what to award the lovely people that help me. Based on an estimate of a monthly cost of around £12 a month to join the site when it's live, I decided to give some discount to Indiegogo investors. Therefore, for just £10 investment, you will get 1 month access to the site. This will increase by a month at £10 intervals and from Level Three of investment I'll start giving away images that will be of a scene from your favourite shoot. At Level Five, the pictures will be printed and signed by the photographer, making a unique artwork even more rare as these will only happen for investors of the initial launch!</p>
<p>As the levels of investment rise, the pictures will become albums and you'll even be invited to input your creative ideas into a shoot at the top tier investment level.</p>
<p>I've also included three special stages especially for businesses. These will range from sponsorship of shoots with 12 month access, to full creative control of the shoot, to including company branding in photographs and advertising on Steampunk Journal.</p>
<p>Should not all the funds be raised, I will use what I have to get as many shoots done as I can. I've not included myself in any totals as I will be financing part of the project myself and I don't think it would be proper. I'll also be funding and building the site myself while the shoots are taking place.</p>
<p>However, if the target gets smashed and we go over, I will be able to expand the benefits such as a custom made website for ultra smooth viewing and a book of images if we do really well. Anything we have spare will either go to more shoots or I'll get some little goodies made up to hand out to people who have helped in the campaign.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480465616/sruvworhfswojv1xw2px.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>One of my aims for the site is to empower the people who pose for the camera. This won't be a seedy website with naked girls. The site will have a variation of clothing removal which will be completely at the request of the model. I want the Hellfire Club to do what burlesque has done whereby it gives people self confidence. That's why the people taking part will be all genders, skin tones and orientations. Any adult who wants to take part will be welcome to be in front of my camera.</p>
<p>Aside from the confidence boost that people can get, they'll also get paid a reasonable wage for working for the Hellfire Club. There's a great deal of angst at the moment surrounding artists and how they feel that people are taking advantage of them under the banner of ""exposure"".</p>
<h3>Risks and overcoming objections</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478349321/inqaciwudtobkxwkj8n5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I'm a regular guy in a regular life, so obviously not everything will go right. Problems rose from the start before I even started planning the campaign. I contacted 30 people who I thought may be interested in working with me and I only received 5 replies. Eventually I managed to find more people and I have a good number of people looking forward to working with me. The biggest risk is people's reliability. However, people working on a shoot for money are much more likely to show up than those working for free. That's another reason I knew I had to raise the funds to pay them.</p>
<p>I expect to run into issues with the site build. I'll be using an entirely new system which is why I'll be starting from when shooting begins. That way I'll have a good 20-30 weeks to get it up and running. I ran into build issues with Steampunk Journal though but it's a smooth running, attractive and bright website now.</p>
<p>I'm a grafter, I currently work on a farm delivering goods and that can be up to 1.5 tonnes a day. I also look after my two children on my own and run the magazine when I'm not doing either of those things, so I'm not averse to hard work. I'm also more determined about this project than anything else I've done. I've even made a video! With me talking on it!</p>
<p>I've been taking pictures for over 20 years now and I know how the industry works, so I'll always have a back up plan. I also worked for a large magazine for two years, so I understand how to make the website popular in the ranks. That's why searching general steampunk terms brings Steampunk Journal either to the top of the list, or within the top three:</p>

<li>Steampunk reviews: 1</li>
<li>Steampunk articles: 1</li>

<p>This demostrates how seriously I take my work, how reputable I am and how focused I am to make my projects the best they can be.</p>

<li>Rights support - Authors are undetachable from our photos, that is clear, but the ownership of different forms of use rights or full ownership of the photo can (and as to be able to) change in time. We are planning to provide these features so the Trusted image will never be ""lost"" in time. It can and it will have its lifetime documented.</li>
<li>Still cameras &amp; other photo capture devices - We are sure there are ways to spread the Trusted image to other devices. Raised funds will help us explore the possibilities towards these devices.</li>

Both of them go hand in hand and probably no one can imagine living without them. But what happens if one of them skews the other one? What if information being presented is not as true as it looks like? Mounting someone face to another photo is pretty funny and shows us how impressive the tools are nowadays. Artificial intelligence can construct whole images from nothing and so it can construct faces on those images, too. How would you prove if it creates your face by chance that this is not a real footage?Generally, how can you prove or verify digital photographs’ credibility?Now you can capture photos with the ability to be verified! Let's create photos that can be trusted!MotivationWe plan to provide a wide spectrum of users and businesses with tools to create credible photos and the services to effectively use these photos.We focus on authors, owners, publishers, use rights, privacy, and security of digital photography.And, of course, on the authenticity and quality of the image itself.Please, read our story to get the key views of the service and values it can provide. You will also get the understanding of the perks and that is important for us, to be for you as clear as possible.What is the Trusted image?The Trusted image now is an iOS application for iPhones for secure photo capturing, verification and signature management from the users’ point of view. And at the same time, there is an online services part responsible for communicating with users through the application and for solving their requests like signing and verification of images.One of the key building blocks of the Trusted image is the signature! As a part of an image, yet invisible to human eyes, it is still resistible against:
brightness manipulations
color manipulations
contrast manipulations
converting to grayscale
convolution filters
scale - the scale factor is variable and depends on image visual attributes

flipping and rotations - rotations in 90° steps CW or CCW

What the Trusted image service produces?Our service produces digital photographs signed by our so-called ""Image Adaptive Neural Networks"". These networks work with the image data the way that they do not visually corrupt the image. We are targeting visual authenticity so the Trusted image application always captures at the highest resolution and uses lossless compression on captured photos. If the user decides to sign the photo, it is uploaded to our service. After the photo is signed, we inform the user that Trusted images are available to download. The service produce the ""Trusted image Original"" - full resolution, losslessly compressed TIFF file. As the name implies, this is the most valuable photo for the user! The key to the service features. From this photo, you can create custom or predefined signed derivates in the future.At the same time, it offers the first ""Trusted image Derivate"" - full resolution, lossy compressed JPEG file as the first derivate of the original. This photo cannot be further derivated and signed using the service!Note: Authors must download signed photos within a month from their signature. Once downloaded successfully to the Trusted image application, they are deleted on the service side.! The service doesn't depend on stored visual data, so we do not store such data !As there is no visual representation of your signed photo stored on our side, it is important to keep at least one Trusted image Original copy of your photo safe and ideally backed up for your future use! The verification and analysis part of the service produces Verification Reports. These reports show you what we know about the image being verified with respect to the users and image privacy settings. In deeper analysis (change detection for example), it provides reports showing what and where some image changes happened.Who can or should use Trusted image and how?This funny question has caused us multiple mental exhaustion, mass headaches, but also amazement at how it could basically be simple. Our principle is to give some benefits to parties involved in the digital photo lifetime. The main benefit is the photo itself, because it gets new properties with the signature, yet without losing quality.

<li>How storm chasers are using their hobby for the greater good; be it warning citizens via social media, educating the public on severe weather safety, to raising funds for disaster-stricken towns in the United States.</li>
<li>What motivates a human to chase a storm, and how chasing storms relates to their everyday life.</li>
<li>The competitive weather news market exclusive to Tornado Alley, and how citizens of the Great Plains deal with a constant tornado threat. </li>
<li>Technology and social media, and how both entities have changed the way the public is notified of incoming severe weather.</li>
<li>How climate change is affecting the severity and frequency of tornado outbreaks.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to truly immerse myself in the storm culture of the Great Plains, I've decided to spend the entirety of the second half of tornado season in Oklahoma City.  This will grant me the freedom to create, while getting a feel for the way of life in the Plains.  The funds raised through this campaign will go directly toward my living and travel expenses for that duration.  How much raise together directly correlates to length of my trip.  The longer I'm able to stay, the greater story we can tell:  <strong>$4,000 </strong>is the amount I would need to stay in the Plains from April 17 - May 31, which includes:  </p>
<ul>

Within the mesocyclone a tornado can occur. The cage is the curtain of heavy precipitation that wraps around the rotating updraft. If a bear is present, it will be a tornado. When a storm chaser goes into the bear's cage, they risk being attacked by the tornado."" - Meteorologist Jeff Haby
The Project
Hi!  I'm Conor Clancy; I'm a photographer and writer based in Philadelphia, PA and I launched Behind The Bear's Cage in May 2016 photographing a group of Oklahoma City-based storm chasers named Tornado Titans.  My initial goal was to bring viewers, quite literally, behind the bear's cage--an ""all access"" look at the rarely-documented life of a storm chaser.  You can check out the photos from that first visit here:

After nearly a year of reflection, research, and a bit of storm chasing on my own, I've become better acquainted with further aspects of the storm chasing community previously unknown to the general public.  Behind The Bear's Cage has grown, and I need your help to make it a reality.  In 2017, I plan to explore:

How storm chasers are using their hobby for the greater good; be it warning citizens via social media, educating the public on severe weather safety, to raising funds for disaster-stricken towns in the United States.
What motivates a human to chase a storm, and how chasing storms relates to their everyday life.
The competitive weather news market exclusive to Tornado Alley, and how citizens of the Great Plains deal with a constant tornado threat. 
Technology and social media, and how both entities have changed the way the public is notified of incoming severe weather.
How climate change is affecting the severity and frequency of tornado outbreaks.

Why are these issues important?  Most storm chasers are great people, doing what they are passionate about, on their own time.  A select few bad apples have given chasers a bad rap in recent years.  My goal with this year's iteration is to bring better visibility to the community's positive contributions; to foster a better relationship between local officials and storm chasers, while simultaneously illustrating the dangers of storm chasing with no experience.  A few bad apples shouldn't spoil the bunch.

<h3>Hi everyone , I,m Cathy</h3>
<p>I m a mum of 5, 2 daughters, a son and 2 step sons. They are all of an age now where they are starting to work on making their own future. My eldest son Barry is going to Queens University in September to study further on Computer Science after completing his foundation Degree with a regional college. I am a very proud mother. I studied myself to receive 9 Gcse's and a NVQ in Business Administration, but I finished education as I had my children young. I brought my children up myself and went through difficulties with health along the way.  I suffered badly with Post Natal Depression and was diagnosed later on in my 30's with Borderline Personality Disorder. I also suffer from Fibromyalgia, Arthritis in my back and hips and a few other different things. It became very difficult for me in life and I couldnt control the Borderline Personality. I tried to find a hobby for therapeutic reasons and eventually I found Photography. I loved it so much that I took myself back to College to study GCSE and passed. I then decided to go further and study at HND level and have completed this year with 4 Distinctions.  One dream that I have consistently had my whole life was to run my own business. Now I feel completely ready!! I started a page on Facebook after I completed my GCSE , so I could gain experience and get models as none of my family really liked to model (except 1 of my daughters). My page has grown to over 1000 likes. I have started going to an Understanding Enterprises course with CIDO Innovation centre and from here on I will have one to one mentoring and I am making up a business plan on the Go For It Programme. I want to open a Studio where I can run a business from. This would need a lot of funding and being on benefits I would find this so hard to do. I have studied hard regardless and don't ever intend to give in to any disabilities that I have.  I need to get premises, premises fitted out and more equipment. I have a lot already as I needed things to progress my studies. If I had funding and this came about I would do Photography sessions and I want to teach Photography and Photoshop, maybe even basic computers. There are so many people who would benefit. I would also like to sell my own framed prints. </p>
<p>I would also like to give back to my community in the mental health . I have already experienced doing this and the results was very overwhelming. I want to help young people, mid age and older and have different projects in mind as to how I can achieve this. This is a cause that means so much to me and I love helping someone and making them smile. Its also important to me that people realise how worthy they are of life and helping them do better. I have been at very low points in my life and completely understand how it can be. With your help I can achieve something massive and of great worth to a whole community. I bet so many of you have known someone in life that have had mental health problems! Dementia is also a cause I would love to help and have an idea for this. </p>
<p>I would need to raise £5000 + to enable this project as I have to think of start up costs, premises, fitting out and then soon as this happens, you need to think about equipment, insurances and lots of bills , so there really is a lot to getting started up. Your support on this journey would really be amazing and there are no words I can say that would express my gratitude. </p>
<p>I am hoping to start some rewards for pledges that are made and I can do this in the form of discounted photography for you and your family to enjoy. I don't have a lot I can give in the form of items but your help , well you have no idea what it means to me.</p>
<p>I have a lot of extensions to add to my business plans as ways that I can overcome any hurdles which may arise and will add them when I have it all finalised. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Please share and help me get backing for this project, it all means the world!!!</p>

<h3>Who I <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">am, what I have done, and my character </span>

<p>My name is Rich Wexler and I have been many things in this life. I have been a music promoter, an artist, photographer, filmmaker, a teacher (of workshops and certified in elementary and special ed), <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and more. I live my life like my heroes of the 1970's. For me this means being community-minded and trying to give back to my community. For every dollar I have ever earned, I try to give back to help someone else out, or to help underserved communities. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I ran a music promotion organization called Sherman Arts (</span><a href=""http://citypaper.net/articles/2005-09-08/music.shtml)%C2%A0that"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"" target=""_blank"">http://citypaper.net/articles/2005-09-08/music....</a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> which created community and supported musicians financially as well as by providing promotion, advice, management, and press. I started this as a reaction to an artist friend who died because she fell ill and was uninsured. She could not get the full medical attention that she needed and she died. Sherman Arts put on many benefit concerts to raise funds for those without insurance so that they could get the support they needed. We were able to pay out about $10,000 over the years for these purposes. That work eventually led me to create an educational theater company for underserved communities. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> We put on ""Rent (</span><a href=""http://citypaper.net/No-Other-Way"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"" target=""_blank"">http://citypaper.net/No-Other-Way</a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">)  in 2011, and ""Avenue Q (</span><a href=""http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/entertainment-guide/66082-weekly-entertainment-guide-avenue-q-school-edition-laughter-on-23rd-floor-and-chekhov)%C2%A0in"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"" target=""_blank"">http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/entert...</a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> in 2013 with a diverse cast of multicultural and LGBT teens.

<br/><b>What this campaign is all about</b>:</div><div>
<b>1. FUNDING MY ART SHOW - WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME</b><br/>
</div><div>This campaign is about a few things. The first is to support my art show at The James Oliver Gallery starting April 9th through May 14th (<a href=""http://www.jamesolivergallery.com)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.jamesolivergallery.com)</a> This show will feature 3D film images in the form of View-Master reels, the thin cardboard disks that contain matching film images viewable through a special viewer, images I've captured on a stereoscopic camera which is basically the home version of the View-Master technology we all grew up with. There will be about 50 or more View-Master viewers and about 100 discs on hand (reels of original work) and I will also be able to project stereoscopic images on the wall. The show will also feature about 200 polaroids, a sample of some digital 3D work I've done (viewable on a 3D television), as well as some super-8 work that I've done. While the show will primarily focus on work that I've captured, I will also feature found work that I've curated; polaroids, View-Master reels and the like. It is very expensive to stage an art show and other than through this campaign, I am funding everything myself. This is a very well known gallery in Philadelphia and even getting this opportunity is huge for me. This will get me much needed attention as an artist that will help me further the business I am basing around these activities. I am also hoping to sell my work, an important step towards making this effort sustainable.<br/><br/><b>2 CREATING  MY WORK - WHY IT IS IMPORTANT</b><br/><br/>My main focus in my work at this point is shooting on film with the personal View-Master camera, a stereoscopic camera created in 1955 for home use - to create personal View-Master reels.The reason I shoot in 3D with film is because I can honestly say there is no experience quite like looking at these images on a 3D viewer. 
The crux of the technology is that two separate photos are taken of a
single subject and then recombined while viewing to produce a binocular depth
simulation- a simple 3D effect. It is the only way to get an image that is this close to what it looks like in the real world. The result is a clear backlit image that has the most depth I have ever
seen in a 3D medium. I can tell you that people are blown away from my work. It's something they fall in love with at first glance. Polaroids have a similar effect as well. They age as time goes by, kind of like a good wine. When you look at them and hold them it has the energy of the person and the time that they were alive, whenever the image was captured. I want to help people document the important events of their lives, their families' lives, their pets' lives, and their friends' lives. <br/><br/><b>3.

</div></div>","Update 3/9/16
I have raised $2180 with a few cash donations not added into this campaign. 
Who I am, what I have done, and my character 

My name is Rich Wexler and I have been many things in this life. I have been a music promoter, an artist, photographer, filmmaker, a teacher (of workshops and certified in elementary and special ed), and more. I live my life like my heroes of the 1970's. For me this means being community-minded and trying to give back to my community. For every dollar I have ever earned, I try to give back to help someone else out, or to help underserved communities. I ran a music promotion organization called Sherman Arts (http://citypaper.net/articles/2005-09-08/music.... which created community and supported musicians financially as well as by providing promotion, advice, management, and press. I started this as a reaction to an artist friend who died because she fell ill and was uninsured. She could not get the full medical attention that she needed and she died. Sherman Arts put on many benefit concerts to raise funds for those without insurance so that they could get the support they needed. We were able to pay out about $10,000 over the years for these purposes. That work eventually led me to create an educational theater company for underserved communities.  We put on ""Rent (http://citypaper.net/No-Other-Way)  in 2011, and ""Avenue Q (http://www.newsworks.org/index.php/local/entert... in 2013 with a diverse cast of multicultural and LGBT teens. These projects were free for all participants. I also hosted a free storytelling class with the live storytelling podcast ""Risk!"" as a sponsor in 2015 as well as a free comic book arts class for teens and adults. 



Currently I am
embarking on a new photography business that incorporates the same social service aspects of my previous work.
What this campaign is all about:
1. FUNDING MY ART SHOW - WHAT THAT MEANS TO ME
This campaign is about a few things. The first is to support my art show at The James Oliver Gallery starting April 9th through May 14th (http://www.jamesolivergallery.com) This show will feature 3D film images in the form of View-Master reels, the thin cardboard disks that contain matching film images viewable through a special viewer, images I've captured on a stereoscopic camera which is basically the home version of the View-Master technology we all grew up with. There will be about 50 or more View-Master viewers and about 100 discs on hand (reels of original work) and I will also be able to project stereoscopic images on the wall. The show will also feature about 200 polaroids, a sample of some digital 3D work I've done (viewable on a 3D television), as well as some super-8 work that I've done. While the show will primarily focus on work that I've captured, I will also feature found work that I've curated; polaroids, View-Master reels and the like. It is very expensive to stage an art show and other than through this campaign, I am funding everything myself. This is a very well known gallery in Philadelphia and even getting this opportunity is huge for me. This will get me much needed attention as an artist that will help me further the business I am basing around these activities. I am also hoping to sell my work, an important step towards making this effort sustainable.2 CREATING  MY WORK - WHY IT IS IMPORTANTMy main focus in my work at this point is shooting on film with the personal View-Master camera, a stereoscopic camera created in 1955 for home use - to create personal View-Master reels.The reason I shoot in 3D with film is because I can honestly say there is no experience quite like looking at these images on a 3D viewer.

Nos mueven las historias que se relacionan con nuestro entorno, las que nos permiten ampliar horizontes y relacionarnos con las personas.We are Misha Vallejo and Isadora Romero, Ecuadorian photographers. We are moved by stories that relate to our environment, the ones that allow us to broaden our horizons and get in touch with people.Puño y Letra  es un trabajo que venimos realizando con mucho cariño desde abril del año pasado a raíz del terremoto de 7.8 grados en la escala de Richter que afectó gran parte de la costa ecuatoriana. Es un trabajo colaborativo que reúne fotografías instantáneas y testimonios escritos a mano por los afectados. Y ahora queremos convertirlo en un libro. Nuestra motivación es generar un documento inclusivo profundo, donde las voces de los afectados sean el principal recurso narrativo.  Tu ayuda permitirá que estos testimonios no sean olvidados. Nosotros estamos convencidos que deben ser recordados como parte de la historia.Handwritten is a body of work that we have been doing with a lot of care since April 2016 following the earthquake of 7.8 degrees in the Richter Scale that affected a big part of the Ecuadorian coast. This is a collaborative work that gathers instant photographs and handwritten testimonies of the survivors. Now we want to make it into a book. We are motivated to create an inclusive and profound document where the voices of the affected people will be the main narrative resource. Your help will allow these testimonies not to be forgotten. We are convinced that these should be a part of history.Sobre el Libro / About the bookUna semana después del terremoto en Ecuador, comenzamos este proyecto que consistió en fotografiar a los damnificados con cámaras Polaroid de revelado instantáneo. Partiendo de la premisa de la emergencia psicológica, realizamos las fotografías durante un proceso de atenta escucha y contención empática. Luego, les solicitamos a los retratados describir sus sentimientos, pensamientos o reflexiones y escribirlos sobre las fotografías; también fotografiamos objetos valiosos que ellos lograron sacar de sus hogares. Las fotografías fueron realizadas en las ciudades y pueblos más afectados de las provincias de Manabí y Esmeraldas.One week after the earthquake in Ecuador, we began the production of the project Handwritten. It consisted in portraying the victims using instant Polaroid cameras. Based on the premise of psychological emergency, we made the photographs during a process of attentive listening and empathic restraint. Later we asked the subjects to describe their feelings, thoughts or reflections and write them on the photographs. Also, valuable objects that they managed to rescue from their homes were photographed. The pictures were made in the most affected cities and villages of Manabí and Esmealdas provinces.Puño y Letra es un ensayo sobre la memoria, un análisis sobre qué significa la imagen en momentos de catástrofe. Las fotografías Polaroid por su característica de soporte efímero, crean una analogía con la fragilidad de la memoria humana. Este proyecto tiene más de 80 testimonios de resiliencia. Sabemos que es un importante documento de memoria colectiva y por eso queremos preservarlo en un libro.Handwritten is an essay about memory, an analysis of what do images mean in catastrophic times. Due to its characteristics as an ephemeral support, the Polaroid pictures create the analogy to human memory. The photographic project gathers more than 80 testimonies of resilience. We know this is an important document of collective memory and this is why we want to preserve it in book form.Entre otros, Puño y Letra ganó el Premio Fotoperiodismo por la Paz Juan Antonio Serrano de Ecuador que consta de una beca de producción artística. Ésta será utilizada en su totalidad para financiar una parte de los costos de la publicación. El resto lo realizaremos con ayuda de colaboradores como tú. El libro será un objeto de altísima calidad editado por Claudi Carreras, reconocido curador y editor iberoamericano. Los fondos recaudados se destinarán a la edición, diseño, diagramación, pruebas de color, impresión y distribución del libro. Imprimiremos un tiraje de 1000 ejemplares y un porcentaje importante será distribuido a centros educativos, de investigación y bibliotecas del Ecuador. Además, queremos entregar el libro a todas las familias que compartieron sus testimonios con nosotros.Among other, Handwritten won the Photojournalism for Peace Prize of Ecuador, which consists of a production grant that will be used in its entirety to cover part of the costs of the publication. The rest will be done with the help of contributors like you. The book will be a high quality object that will be edited by the recognized Spanish editor and curator Claudi Carreras. The gathered funds will be used to edit, design, make color proofs, print and distribute the book. 1000 copies will be printed and a percentage of them will be distributed to educational and research centers. We also want to give a copy of the book to all the families and people that shared their testimonies with us.Características aproximadas del libro:Pasta dura25 cm x 18 cm108 páginasPáginas con laminado UV selectivoEdición de 1000 ejemplaresApproximate characteristics of the book:Hardcover25 cm x 18 cm108 pagesPages with selective UV coatingEdition of 1000Al momento de lanzar esta campaña se ha cumplido un año y medio del terremoto.

<h3>Nuestra historia / Our story</h3>
<p>La idea de CovenGirls nació en el año 2014 en un grupo de amigos con la intención de armar una serie de fotografías macabras y/o eróticas que tuvieran en cuenta los detalles que muchas veces se pasan por alto, excepto claramente, para los <i>nerds</i>. <strong>Nuestro concepto básico es que las modelos elijan las temáticas de las sesiones por cosas que conozcan, para poder tener un resultado más fiel a las fuentes</strong>. Así empezamos a tener sesiones basadas en películas, cómics, mitología y literatura con un grupo de modelos <i>no profesionales</i> que demuestran que la clave de la sensualidad, es la <u>actitud</u>. //</p>
<p>The idea of CovenGirls started back in 2014 with a group of friends that wanted to shoot a series of macabre and/or erotic photos that had in mind the little details that usually get ignored, except of course, for <i>nerds</i>.  <strong>Our basic concept is that our models choose the themes for their sets based on things they know so we can have results that are true to the subject</strong>. That's how we started our sets based on movies, comicbooks,mythology and literature with a group of <i>non-profesional</i> models that prove that the key to sensuality, is in the <u>attitude</u>. </p>

<p>My name is Eliana, I'm a photographer and I'm from Montevideo, Uruguay.<br/>Two years ago I decided to photograph people from 100 countries who were living in my city in order to show that it is becoming a home to people from all around the world.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554579022/rvtrzv5g1vgyboptk8ds.jpg"" src=""""/>At the beginning, my family and friends were not very positive about the idea; to them, that number was just impossible to achieve. My enthusiasm was stronger than their opinion so I started to contact the Embassies, Consulates and Cultural Centers presenting the project and asking for their collaboration.

<h3>Why do I ask for your support?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>As you can imagine, this is a very ambicious project and I will need at least 38.000 USD to realize it.</p>
<p>My expenses are explained below:<br/>Plane Tickets                       35%<br/>Accomodation                    20%<br/>Land Transportation         15%<br/>Campaign Costs                 13%<br/>Food                                          7%<br/>Unexpected Expenses        5%<br/>Visas/Insurances                 5%</p>
<p>I have various long-distance flights; that will cost me a considerable amount of money. I will have some land trasportation since not all the participants are from the capital of their countries. Apart from covering accomodation, food and visas I need to be aware of the unexpected expenses that I can face during the journey.</p>
<h3><strong>A flexible campaign</strong></h3>
<p>I don't need to reach the entire amount of money to begin the journey. I've calculated how much do I need to cover at least the first part of the project. From there on, I can continue exploring other ways to finance the second part: </p>
<p>South America                   18%</p>
<p>America (complete)         30%</p>
<p>America and Europe         50%</p>

<h2>Dressed In Layers: A Hanbok Project</h2>
<p>안녕하세요! 반갑습니다~ </p>
<p>Hi there! Thank you for being here. We (Erin and Harriet) are so happy you're here.  We're two Korean-Canadians living in Toronto, working on this passion project using art and stories to bridge our experiences of home, memory, and family.  </p>
<p>Dressed in Layers: A Hanbok Project is a grassroots project that explores the relationship that members of the Korean-Canadian diaspora hold between this land and the homeland, as well as the many spaces in-between.</p>
<p>Our first big initiative is a <strong>portrait series</strong> featuring members of the Korean-Canadian diaspora wearing the Korean traditional <strong>hanbok </strong>(traditional Korean attire). Subjects are photographed in places and spaces that are self-selected and hold particular meaning for them. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582502811/zmpu3sbjnyo6qsadbwrl.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Rosel Kim, Christie and Bloor Koreatown, 2019. Photographed by Harriet Kim.</i></p>
<p>We see arts, education, and personal reflection as centrally interrelated, and hope to use a variety of initiatives to explore this work in the future. We also emphasize that any critical reflection on “home” and “place” in the diasporic context cannot exist without a critical reflection on the history of Canada, its colonization, and our relationships and responsibilities with this land - thus this project is also one of learning and solidarity. </p>
<p>We hope that this project sparks dialogue not only within the Korean-Canadian community but in the many other communities of diaspora in Toronto and beyond. As just two dorks who are passionately pursuing a project from our hearts, we are SO grateful for your support with this work!</p>

<h3>Our Premiere Exhibit</h3>
<p>As part of our first initiative, we are launching a premiere exhibit from<strong> April 16th - April 26th,</strong> at the <a href=""https://www.northerncontemporarygallery.com/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Northern Contemporary Gallery</a>. The exhibit will feature portraits taken by Harriet Kim of Korean-Canadians wearing hanbok in places that are meaningful to them. Stories and experiences are also highlighted in this exhibit. </p>

<p>We will also be hosting events and workshops during our 10-day exhibit, which we'll announce here. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As a grassroots project, we are creating art through the magic of hustle, collaboration, and love. This project has already created so much connection and community between the folks who have been involved so far, and with some extra support we can accomplish so much more! </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $3500 to support the first collection in the Dressed in Layers series. This will roughly look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2000 in exhibition costs (venue, display hardware, transportation)</li>
<li>$1000 in honouraria for models </li>
<li>$500 for photo editing and administrative support</li>
</ul>
<p>Though this will not cover all of ours costs, we hope to raise more funds through events and merchandise sales. All of the funds we use will be to directly support the project and compensate people who have been involved in its creation!</p>
<p>We're so excited to offer some really cool gifts in exchange for your support. Our perks include stickers, luggage tags, postcards, and small-batch kimchi*! &lt;3 </p>

<h3>All About Community </h3>
<p>To us, this is not simply a portrait series - it represents hundreds of points of connection for those in the Korean-Canadian diaspora, and much beyond. Through the combination of visual and oral storytelling and a variety of artistic media, we seek to encourage intergenerational, intersectional dialogue. </p>
<p>As settlers on this land, our personal missions are also to use this opportunity to learn, educate each other, and practice solidarity with the original inhabitants of this land. We believe that such dialogue must happen first within our own communities, and in ways that bridge the myriad experiences we each hold. This exhibit is one step towards this journey and we would love you to come along with us! </p>

<h3>How to Support in Non-Monetary Ways </h3>
<p>We are so grateful for any and all support! We'd love if you would consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing our campaign with your friends and networks</li>
<li>Sharing your time by volunteering during our exhibition (e.g. supporting at events) </li>

<b>Travel Expenses.</b>  To photograph and document each trip, we've got to get there first!  Each photographer has already committed to paying their way if necessary, but with much of our group being college age to young professionals, financial assistance is always a huge help!  Plus this will make it much more viable for future missions, as covering their cost will be a large part of our ministry!</li> <li>
<b>Book Printing Costs.</b>  In order to create the gorgeous coffee table books with the stories and pictures from each of the trips, we need to print a minimum of 50 books, and the more we order the more affordable we can offer them in the future!</li>

<div>We appreciate you taking the time just to hear about our project, and thank you in advance for anything you're willing to do to help further the ministry!  We will be providing updates along the way and looking forward to taking this journey together!</div>
</div></div>","We are a group of Christian photographers with a passion for participating in, documenting and bringing awareness to global missions. This Summer, we will be sending out a group of 7 or more photographers to 7 different countries on mission trips to photograph and tell the story of the people, places and projects we encounter along the way!  

Our ultimate goal is to bring more awareness to these Christian outreaches, by creating a unique photography, experience and testimony driven book of the different mission trips in such a way that you will feel like you were personally a part of each one!  We want to be able to create a passion for missions that will stick with people far beyond their initial experience, and positively impact the people and places we meet through prayer, exposure and financial support.




To raise awareness and train photographers for Christian based mission trips around the globe.  Within that, we have 3 primary objectives:

Raise up and train future photographers who have a heart for missions
Use photography as a tool for interacting and witnessing in the mission field
Bring awareness and exposure to each mission trip; prayer requests, support & volunteer opportunities.








This Summer we will be participating in 8 different mission trips from June - August through the MVMNT Missions organization to the following countries:



Thailand
United States
Cambodia
Zambia
Haiti (2 different trips)
Panama
Scotland

Our goal is to expand this to train and send out more photographers to more nations through even more organizations following the success of this campaign for 2016!





 We are needing to secure funds for 3 main purposes, all equally important!  Each contribution has a reward offer tied to it that we are happy to provide, and will go a long way towards the following areas of need: 

Photography Equipment.  Each of the photographers have a varied set of personal equipment, but we are raising funds to fill in those gaps and have a specific set to use for future trips & ministry opportunities.   
Travel Expenses.  To photograph and document each trip, we've got to get there first!  Each photographer has already committed to paying their way if necessary, but with much of our group being college age to young professionals, financial assistance is always a huge help!  Plus this will make it much more viable for future missions, as covering their cost will be a large part of our ministry! 
Book Printing Costs.  In order to create the gorgeous coffee table books with the stories and pictures from each of the trips, we need to print a minimum of 50 books, and the more we order the more affordable we can offer them in the future!




   
 Here are all the amazing rewards we are proud to offer as a thank you for your contributions!    
Digital Wallpapers - Our top 25 hand selected images from the trips will look amazing as your desktop or social media background!

Postcard - Digitally signed, printed and delivered from your selected trip!

<h3></h3>
</div><p></p><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>Hi, this is Jonny, when I was younger I always loved to play with my father's camera and thought to myself ... ""maybe one day I will do something meaningful and creative with it."" Years and years later I started doing Photoshop and photo restoration which I really love, but, I sill felt as a part of my creativity was missing.  I went to visit my father recently and we went on a family trip to Dumbarton Oaks in Washington DC. I  got a chance to play with the old camera again... like old times. I amplified the pictures in Photoshop because the camera was very old! and could not capture the colors/lighting very well. It inspired me to get serious about my passion for photography, and finally add ""the missing"" link into my skill set! It also got me thinking I could do video as well so that I can co-create a new business with my partner Niki, she does beauty makeup and helps people in spiritual transformations. She is going to be launching a new campaign soon that we are working on together! With your support, I would be able to realize my passion and create a business that would fulfill both me and my partners dream to inspire the world through our vision of love, light, and creativity together. If you would like to check-out the website I created for her and the pictures I retouched in her portfolio, please go to <a href=""http://www.manavi-promakeup.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.manavi-promakeup.com</a></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>I have researched the camera equipment and the lighting. The video equipment and accessories for the shoots I am looking to do will cost $5,000 or more. I am offering some perks for complementary Photoshop work for any business project, head shot, or creative shoot that you may need pictures for, I can make them look better and bring them to life– as a thank you gift. If I don't reach my exact goal I will still be more than happy to receive as much assistance as I can for my new business endeavor!</p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p></p><p>I appreciate you spreading the word even if you are not able to assist me right now, I totally understand. I would be more than grateful if you can let others know about what I am doing. Thank you so much! Happy Thanksgiving in advance and have happy upcoming holidays! </p><p>Love,</p><p>Jonny and Niki</p><div>

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>In May of this year, Laura will be following her partner, Matt, to the cities of Porto Alegre and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Matt, will be teaching Brazilian musicians, music students, and local children Kansas City-style jazz in the traditions of Count Basie and Charlie Parker. He will also play in local music venues with Brazilian musicians blending Kansas City jazz standards, Matt’s original compositions, and Brazilian styles of music. Laura will record conversations with their Brazilian hosts, interviews with the local musicians, and the musical exchanges that Matt and the Brazilian musicians have. This music and snippets of the conversations will be compiled into an audio CD. </p>
<p>Each day over the course of our two weeks in Brazil, Laura will open a handwritten letter from Maritza which will share personal stories and guide her into exploring various aspects of her experience; exploring the displacement of her hometown into this new-to-her setting and culture. Does the familiar still feel comforting and familiar when it is out-of-context? Laura will document the experience through photography, video, and personal essays while creating original handmade collage works capturing the sights and sounds of following her heart to another continent.</p>
<p>Tying long-distance friendship, the displacement of culture, and travel-with-a-romantic-partner together into an introspective on-the-move residency, <b><i>Where I Am</i></b> will challenge Laura and Matt to create deeply personal work that hones-in on what it means to be from Kansas City.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What's In It For You</h3>
<p>Taking this project international and recording a live album is no small task. Our hosts in Brazil are helping us with what they can, but the costs of travel to Brazil, recording, and CD production still leave us with quite a bit of funding to cover. We’ve set a minimum funding goal of <b>$4450</b> in order to really make this project happen. But we have an <b>IDEAL goal of $6500</b> which would allow us to realize an even better CD package packed with photos and stories, but more exciting than that… we would be able to bring one of our Brazilian hosts, guitarist Antonio Flores, back to Kansas City to give a special concert with Matt! This would be AMAZING!</p>
<p>We know that when you back someone’s work, it’s making a strong statement of faith in what we do. We take that show of support very seriously. We’ve come up with some special incentive packages for you for helping us realize this project! (Including an evening playing tunes and sipping yerba mate with us out of traditional calabash mugs we will bring back for you from Brazil!)</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
</div><p>Although Laura and Maritza have done their <b><i>You Are #NotHere</i></b> project in Kansas City, San Francisco, St. Louis, and Oakland… taking it international and to Brazil is a big step. And while Matt is no stranger to playing and recording music, having performed on multiple albums and produced his own album, recording the live sessions in Brazil while on the move will be a unique challenge. Thankfully, we like to overthink things and plan ahead:</p>
<p>•Technology. Well we certainly have the technology but having it all work on-the-move in Porto Alegre and Rio? We’re doing our research and getting all of Laura’s tech equipment set up with backups, extra storage, and all the necessary international adaptions. We’re stopping just short of making Laura herself bionic. (Although we haven’t entirely ruled that out.)</p>
<p>•Lost. We will fully admit it. We are Americans and we will be lost in Brazil… at least we would be IF we didn’t have amazing hosts there who will be with us every step of the way. We won’t be tourists; our team is taking us into their schools, homes, and lives.</p>
<p>•Ambition. Yeah, we know this is a really big undertaking. Art and travel and recording and producing a CD… what can we say, we like to do ALL THE THINGS. But if you look at our individual track records, we find ways to make it happen. This is a huge opportunity for us to create great art, deepen our study of Brazilian music, and share Kansas City with a special corner of the world. </p><div>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3>Other Ways To Help</h3> <p></p>
<p>Share our project with your friends. Follow our journey on our social media feeds. Help us connect with anyone you know who would be interested in this Kansas City/Brazil arts &amp; music cultural exchange. The greater the circle of friends… the closer home will feel, even when we are far away. Obrigada!</p>

We know that when you back someone’s work, it’s making a strong statement of faith in what we do. We take that show of support very seriously. We’ve come up with some special incentive packages for you for helping us realize this project! (Including an evening playing tunes and sipping yerba mate with us out of traditional calabash mugs we will bring back for you from Brazil!)

    Risks & Challenges  
Although Laura and Maritza have done their You Are #NotHere project in Kansas City, San Francisco, St. Louis, and Oakland… taking it international and to Brazil is a big step. And while Matt is no stranger to playing and recording music, having performed on multiple albums and produced his own album, recording the live sessions in Brazil while on the move will be a unique challenge. Thankfully, we like to overthink things and plan ahead:
•Technology. Well we certainly have the technology but having it all work on-the-move in Porto Alegre and Rio? We’re doing our research and getting all of Laura’s tech equipment set up with backups, extra storage, and all the necessary international adaptions. We’re stopping just short of making Laura herself bionic. (Although we haven’t entirely ruled that out.)
•Lost. We will fully admit it. We are Americans and we will be lost in Brazil… at least we would be IF we didn’t have amazing hosts there who will be with us every step of the way. We won’t be tourists; our team is taking us into their schools, homes, and lives.
•Ambition. Yeah, we know this is a really big undertaking. Art and travel and recording and producing a CD… what can we say, we like to do ALL THE THINGS. But if you look at our individual track records, we find ways to make it happen. This is a huge opportunity for us to create great art, deepen our study of Brazilian music, and share Kansas City with a special corner of the world. 


Other Ways To Help 
Share our project with your friends. Follow our journey on our social media feeds. Help us connect with anyone you know who would be interested in this Kansas City/Brazil arts & music cultural exchange. The greater the circle of friends… the closer home will feel, even when we are far away. Obrigada!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

I would love to name everybody here, but I will just say, there were incredible fashion designers, make-up artists, stylists, set designers, fellow photographers, filmmakers and fearless (by the way mostly non-professional) models that made the project possible. Apart from the still pictures I developed a video short containing nine episodes. I will publish approximately two of the episodes online during this campaign, but the rest will only be shown at the exhibition and sent out exclusively with the artist edition of the book.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486856783/drtv0w1akv4s5cpn7ur0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>""Menschen, die behaupten sich zu lieben #54/7""</i></p><p><font size=""5""><b><u>I need you!</u></b></font></p><p>But my pride and joy is the oversized hand-bound artist edition of the book in a format of 289 x 380mm (11.38 x 14.96 inches), with a silver clad hard cover, sliver endpaper and a total of 104 pages. Because of the big format the stories are especially tangible and combined with the witty and creative dialogs the flipping through the book becomes an experience. The images develop an independent force while the texts create concentrated insights in emotional worlds through extreme reduction and the open layout leaves room for inner pictures. The book is limited to 25 copies, dated and signed.

Mein professioneller Schwerpunkt liegt auf konzeptioneller Modefotografie. Obwohl Modefotografie meist im Grunde ein Produkt abbilden soll, möchte ich in meiner Arbeit stets den Menschen in den Vordergrund stellen.</p><p>Täglich erleben wir Inszenierungen der Liebe. In den Medien kursieren Unmengen an gespielten Bildern glücklich verliebter Menschen. Soziale Netzwerke sind voll davon, die Werbung malt das Bild noch schöner. Ist das die Wirklichkeit, sieht Liebe so aus? Einerseits ist die Liebe das höchste Gut... andererseits scheint sie niemand tatsächlich zu thematisieren. Reichen uns diese Stereotype? Geben wir uns damit zufrieden?</p><p>In meiner Arbeit beschäftige ich mich mit romantischer Liebe als allmächtiges, aber ungreifbares Gefühl zwischen zwei Menschen. Ich thematisiere dabei den Blick der Liebenden aufeinander, auf sich selbst und auf die Beziehung von außen. Ich hinterfrage Realität und Authentizität eines Gefühls, dessen Inszenierung allgegenwärtig ist und erkenne sie in ihrer ganzen Ernsthaftigkeit und Naivität an.</p><p>Es sind sieben Strecken mit 14 Protagonisten und insgesamt 62 Einzelbildern entstanden, die verschiedene Beziehungsstrukturen oder mögliche Momente zwischen zwei Liebenden darstellen. Die Strecken werden mit Dialogen von Sibylla Hirschhäuser kombiniert. Der visuellen Inszenierung dienten Paare aus Theaterstücken von William Shakespeares als Inspirationsvorlage. Das Projekt wurde tatsächlich erst durch die zahlreichen talentierten Modedesigner, Make-Up Artisten, Stylisten, Set-Designer, Filmer, Models und vielen weiteren Unterstützern möglich gemacht! Begleitend habe ich einen Film entwickelt, der aus neun Episoden besteht.</p><p>Die konzeptionelle Arbeit erscheint in einem handgebundenen, großformatigen Hardcover-Buch (Umschlag 3mm Karton, aufkaschiertes Silberpapier, 104 Innenseiten) im Format 289 x 380 mm. Die Auflage ist limitiert und handsigniert, das Buch erscheint in deutscher Sprache. Musterbücher sind erstellt (siehe Bilder), unmittelbar nach Abschluss des Crowdfunding gehen wir im Eigenverlag in Produktion. Eine Ausstellung der Arbeit wird am 4. April 2017 in München eröffnet.</p><p>Hochwertige Bücher wie diese werden aufgrund der hohen Kosten selten produziert. Das große Format macht die künstlerische Arbeit für den Betrachter besonders erlebbar. Die Motive entfalten ganz eigenständige Wirkung, die Texte werfen durch ihre extreme Reduktion starke, nachhaltige Schlaglichter auf private Gefühlswelten und das offene Layout bietet Freiräume für innere Bilder.</p><p>Mit eurer Hilfe soll sowohl der sehr aufwendige Buchdruck finanziert werden, als auch die Ausstellung und Geschenke, die ich als Dankeschön in dieser Kampagne anbiete. Ihr könnt mir auch durch die Verbreitung der Kampagne durch E-Mail, Facebook, Twitter und Instagram weiterhelfen, oder indem ihr einfach euren Freunden davon erzählt!

But these characters were only able to completely come to life because of Sibylla who wrote new brilliant dialogs between the personalities and made them whole in their own reality. And where would I be without Sarah who not only, helped me to make a total of six protagonists shine through her talent for looks, but in the end gave her own body to be captured by the camera. I would love to name everybody here, but I will just say, there were incredible fashion designers, make-up artists, stylists, set designers, fellow photographers, filmmakers and fearless (by the way mostly non-professional) models that made the project possible. Apart from the still pictures I developed a video short containing nine episodes. I will publish approximately two of the episodes online during this campaign, but the rest will only be shown at the exhibition and sent out exclusively with the artist edition of the book.""Menschen, die behaupten sich zu lieben #54/7""I need you!But my pride and joy is the oversized hand-bound artist edition of the book in a format of 289 x 380mm (11.38 x 14.96 inches), with a silver clad hard cover, sliver endpaper and a total of 104 pages. Because of the big format the stories are especially tangible and combined with the witty and creative dialogs the flipping through the book becomes an experience. The images develop an independent force while the texts create concentrated insights in emotional worlds through extreme reduction and the open layout leaves room for inner pictures. The book is limited to 25 copies, dated and signed. Although the original language is German, I will develop an English translation that can capture Sibylla’s whit and unique style so my international supporters can enjoy the dialogs. ""Menschen, die behaupten sich zu lieben"" limited artist edition; page 70/71; styling by Anne Wencelides, make-up/hair by Lucille RohmerI also created a more imperfect and nostalgia-inspired newspaper edition that can’t reach the quality of the book but still contains all the content and is desirable in its fragility. Finally, I designed a DIN-A3 (11.69 x 16.54 inches) infinite calendar that can carry 13 selected images of the project on your wall forever and a 5-piece postcard collectors-set. The first public exhibition is planned for the 4th of April, 2017 in Munich, a poster and a flyer will be produced.With this campaign I hope to finance the production of the artist edition and the gifts, as well as the exhibition that all supporters are warmly invited to. Right after the end of this fundraising I will go into production and send out the gifts or hand them over with a big hug at the vernissage. ""Menschen, die behaupten sich zu lieben"" limited artist edition; page 18/19, dialogs by Sibylla HirschhäuserSpread the love!Thank you so much for reading and showing interest in my project!

Mein professioneller Schwerpunkt liegt auf konzeptioneller Modefotografie. Obwohl Modefotografie meist im Grunde ein Produkt abbilden soll, möchte ich in meiner Arbeit stets den Menschen in den Vordergrund stellen.Täglich erleben wir Inszenierungen der Liebe. In den Medien kursieren Unmengen an gespielten Bildern glücklich verliebter Menschen. Soziale Netzwerke sind voll davon, die Werbung malt das Bild noch schöner. Ist das die Wirklichkeit, sieht Liebe so aus? Einerseits ist die Liebe das höchste Gut... andererseits scheint sie niemand tatsächlich zu thematisieren. Reichen uns diese Stereotype? Geben wir uns damit zufrieden?In meiner Arbeit beschäftige ich mich mit romantischer Liebe als allmächtiges, aber ungreifbares Gefühl zwischen zwei Menschen. Ich thematisiere dabei den Blick der Liebenden aufeinander, auf sich selbst und auf die Beziehung von außen. Ich hinterfrage Realität und Authentizität eines Gefühls, dessen Inszenierung allgegenwärtig ist und erkenne sie in ihrer ganzen Ernsthaftigkeit und Naivität an.Es sind sieben Strecken mit 14 Protagonisten und insgesamt 62 Einzelbildern entstanden, die verschiedene Beziehungsstrukturen oder mögliche Momente zwischen zwei Liebenden darstellen. Die Strecken werden mit Dialogen von Sibylla Hirschhäuser kombiniert. Der visuellen Inszenierung dienten Paare aus Theaterstücken von William Shakespeares als Inspirationsvorlage. Das Projekt wurde tatsächlich erst durch die zahlreichen talentierten Modedesigner, Make-Up Artisten, Stylisten, Set-Designer, Filmer, Models und vielen weiteren Unterstützern möglich gemacht! Begleitend habe ich einen Film entwickelt, der aus neun Episoden besteht.Die konzeptionelle Arbeit erscheint in einem handgebundenen, großformatigen Hardcover-Buch (Umschlag 3mm Karton, aufkaschiertes Silberpapier, 104 Innenseiten) im Format 289 x 380 mm. Die Auflage ist limitiert und handsigniert, das Buch erscheint in deutscher Sprache. Musterbücher sind erstellt (siehe Bilder), unmittelbar nach Abschluss des Crowdfunding gehen wir im Eigenverlag in Produktion. Eine Ausstellung der Arbeit wird am 4. April 2017 in München eröffnet.Hochwertige Bücher wie diese werden aufgrund der hohen Kosten selten produziert. Das große Format macht die künstlerische Arbeit für den Betrachter besonders erlebbar. Die Motive entfalten ganz eigenständige Wirkung, die Texte werfen durch ihre extreme Reduktion starke, nachhaltige Schlaglichter auf private Gefühlswelten und das offene Layout bietet Freiräume für innere Bilder.Mit eurer Hilfe soll sowohl der sehr aufwendige Buchdruck finanziert werden, als auch die Ausstellung und Geschenke, die ich als Dankeschön in dieser Kampagne anbiete. Ihr könnt mir auch durch die Verbreitung der Kampagne durch E-Mail, Facebook, Twitter und Instagram weiterhelfen, oder indem ihr einfach euren Freunden davon erzählt!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>If you watched the video before moving down the page to these words, you may be wondering what an interview with brothers in the jungle of Peru has to do with helping orphans in Iraq.</p>
<p>In 2012, I went to the Amazon jungle with <a href=""http://www.pams.org/en/selva_in_action"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Selva in Action</a>, an American-Peruvian medical organization, and photographed their medical clinic in the jungle. Some of these images can be seen <a href=""http://timscottphotography.com/portfolio/jungle-clinic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">at this link</a>. Additionally, I have an ongoing personal project about what it is like to be a teen around the world - <a href=""http://postcardsfromyouth.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">click to visit this project site</a>.</p>
<p>One organization I am currently volunteering for, the <a href=""http://alalusifoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alalusi Foundation</a>, has invited me to accompany them to Iraqi Kurdistan in order to document their work with orphans. At this time, it is estimated that we will depart in late October 2017. This Indiegogo fundraiser is to ensure that I can fulfill my commitment to Hesham Alalusi and the many individuals who work very hard to provide for the care of now over 1,500 children orphaned by events - both violent and economic - in Iraq.</p>
<p>Now about the program that I will support with my photography in October:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Our signature program, the Iraq Orphans Project (IOP) works within – not against – cultural and religious norms for a working solution to one of Iraqs’ most intractable problems – an estimated 2.5 to 5 million orphans. Instead of adoptions or orphanages – frowned-upon last resorts – the Foundation supports families who have taken on the responsibility of caring for the children of deceased loved ones. Food, medicine, and material support reach the families through a network of on-the-ground distribution and validation partners, including three of the oldest and most respected charitable organizations in Iraq. Through them and others, we are supporting over 1,500 orphans (with one-year sponsorships) in locations from Mosul to Basrah, the Orphans’ Khayrat al-Mosul Village, the Dar Al Amin Iraqi Safe House for Orphans in Sadr City, and individual families of widows and orphaned girls.</i></p>
<p><strong>If you've done this before, why have a crowdfunding campaign?</strong></p>
<p>In 2009 I purchased my camera - the first generation Canon 5D - and I bought it second hand. In the eight years since, this workhorse has taken many wonderful images, but it also has shown its limitations and now is showing its age. To continue photographing for such organizations as the Valentino Achak Deng Foundation and Alalusi Foundation, it is time to repair and replace some of my gear.</p>
<p>So, to answer that question, with your support I will be able to create more films, like the one above, highlighting not just the problems that NGOs work to alleviate every day, but the people behind their work.</p>
<p>The results of my documentation work will be put on the Alalusi Foundation website both in still and video form. In addition to documenting the work of the foundation, I intend to interview some of the youth touched by the foundation's generosity so that we can  bring their struggles and hopes to a wide audience. </p>
<p>The output of this crowdfunding will not end with Alalusi, but continue on with other organizations I work with currently, and ones that I plan to build a relationship with.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p><strong>Where will the money go?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Canon 5D Mark III - This is not the newest generation, but is two generations better than the one I currently use. - $2,500</li>
<li>Audio Recorder - <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">While the 5D will replace my 11 year old video camera, but when filming a separate audio recorder is needed to ensure quality sound. - $250</span>
</li>
<li><p>Microphone - $250</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Everyone has heard the expression, ""A picture is worth a thousand words."" In the NGO community, usually only the very big have the capacity to create professional quality visual documentation of the work they do, while smaller organizations often lack the resources to invest in it.</p>
<p>Volunteering to accompany and document NGO work is a valuable asset to the organizations and to the people they serve. With images I create, descriptions of their services come alive in the minds of potential donors, be they foundations or individuals. Photo and video productions have been shown to increase giving, allowing foundations to do more in their target communities.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>What you get are great perks including original prints from my art portfolio. Drop by <a href=""http://timscottphotography.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TSP</a> to see what you can get a copy of. Start off in the <a href=""http://timscottphotography.com/buy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shop</a> and then mosey over to the <a href=""http://timscottphotography.com/portfolio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Portfolio</a> section. Pretty much any photo on my site is available to receive as a perk. Experiencing option paralysis? Let me know what you are interested in and I will propose some options.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>What happens if I don't make the goal before the Iraq trip?</strong></p>
<p>I have committed to going and still will despite the result of this fundraiser. I simply will be forced to do less than I hoped for as my current equipment is not up to the task due to age and quality.</p>
<p><strong>I see in the news reports about conflict between the government of Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan. What happens if the trip to Erbil is cancelled due to instability?</strong></p>
<p>This is unlikely. But, if the foundation cancels their aid trip to the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, they will divert their attention to other projects they have in the works and I will accompany them. This crowdfunding is not just for this one trip, but for many volunteer opportunities into the future where solid dependable photo equipment is needed. I will update on this page any changes to my plans as well as additions in the future.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute funds, that doesn't mean you can't help. You can still use Indiegogo’s share tools to get the work out!</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this far. I hope you will help me get the proper equipment so that I can continue supporting the work of great humanitarian organizations!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello my name is Sylvester Finch and I am a NYC photographer and creative. This campaign was started to help support my work trip to Cameroon, Africa. I started out my independent journey in photography in 2015 and be using the equipment I gained along the way. However for this next adventure in my life, I am heading on a month long trip to Cameroon, Africa for behind the scenes photography on an upcoming film.</p>
<p>I am looking to use funds raised in this campaign to support me getting more equipment to better facilitate this trip. I am also planing on getting involved with the community of Cameroon to see how I can give back to a community that's welcoming me.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking for four-thousands dollars to aide this campaign. Some of the items I'm looking to pick up for this trip are a steady cam for DSLR camera, external hard-drives, memory cards, a new lens, &amp; additional chargers, just to name a few. Some of the perks I have create for this campaign include ending video project special mention, signed prints with thank you message, souvenirs from Cameroon, and producer credit to name a few. In the event I am unable to reach my entire goal funds will go to purchasing as much of the equipment listed above as possible. Like memory cards which are very important for this trip.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign is valuable because you will be supporting a young entrepreneur first big project ever! The success of this campaign will allow me to better create a platform for myself whereas I can pay it forward to help other crafts for people. It is also important as it will enable people to have a different look at another country in Africa. I am hoping the impact made during this trip will turn into aide the country of Cameroon and its future endeavors. .</p>
<p>My time in photography profession is young but I feel this is the first step to really establishing myself in this field. This opportunity does not come about everyday and I do not want to waste it. I'm truly just a guy who realize he wanted more out of life than a 9 to 5 for 60 years until I retire. I want a life full of passion, purpose, people, and excitement. I'm taking a chance on life and hoping you will take a chance on me.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've been dabbling in nature photography for as long as I can remember.<br/>I remember vividly once as a child telling someone that my goal was to one day be skilled enough to take beautiful pictures of birds, I was told that birds are too difficult and that I should try for something easier... I think that's why my birds shots are the ones I am the most proud of.<br/>Though I don't think I would ever photograph birds exclusively, that is my main focus.</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to build a foundation from which I can expand my photographic pursuits.</p>
<p>What's a home without art?<br/>Who says fine art has to cater exclusively to  the rich?<br/>I will strive to provide affordable pieces of scenery for any household.</p>
<p>By supporting an independent photographer like myself  you will brighten your life and home with natural scenes of beauty while helping me get on my feet as an artist.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All money donated to this project will go specifically towards funding prints to sell in galleries, art spaces, and online; making calendars for 2018 (which are available here as well). And to expand my portfolio for future projects.</p>
<p>For each contribution level there are different, sometimes themed, perks available.<br/>These perks correlate with images in the ""Photography Start-up Selection"" photo album on the Stevie Drayson Photography page on Facebook that you can use for reference on the items with multiple options.<br/>With the holidays coming up, these would also make great gifts for your friends and family!</p>
<p>The perks will be shipped out in batches as stock is made available throughout the campaign. the campaign ends Dec. 4 therefore the absolute final day anything will be shipped out will be Dec. 5. If you are planning to give away your perks as a gift, please keep this in mind.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting this project you will be helping promote 'art for the every-man,' affordable art made on my own terms for anyone, not just expensive galleries or the artistic elite. You'll be supporting an independent artist with a different perspective and be able to engage with art that has a focus on the everyday beauty of the natural world around us that some may forget to have noticed otherwise (though this specific project has a bit more of a worldly focus than usual)</p>

For each contribution level there are different, sometimes themed, perks available.These perks correlate with images in the ""Photography Start-up Selection"" photo album on the Stevie Drayson Photography page on Facebook that you can use for reference on the items with multiple options.With the holidays coming up, these would also make great gifts for your friends and family!
The perks will be shipped out in batches as stock is made available throughout the campaign. the campaign ends Dec. 4 therefore the absolute final day anything will be shipped out will be Dec. 5. If you are planning to give away your perks as a gift, please keep this in mind.

The Impact
By supporting this project you will be helping promote 'art for the every-man,' affordable art made on my own terms for anyone, not just expensive galleries or the artistic elite. You'll be supporting an independent artist with a different perspective and be able to engage with art that has a focus on the everyday beauty of the natural world around us that some may forget to have noticed otherwise (though this specific project has a bit more of a worldly focus than usual)

<h2><strong>About my previous journey</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Starting in India and Nepal in 2009, I have traveled the third world countries such as Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Burma, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia etc. I am interested in the disappearing scenery. The world is rapidly changing and modernizing so that we can not remember yesterday. I am so sad with it. Sometimes I felt hopeless and a lot of doubts about life. That's why I am visiting less civilized and old-fashioned places. When I travel around such places, I can meet what I've missed. And I can see what we have lost and what we need to recover and preserve. I am afraid that everything will disappear if I am a little late. I am also afraid that we can see these beautiful moments only in photographs in the future.</p>

Even though I have been on this photo journey for 8 years, but it's still hard, uneasy and lonely. Of course it's my favorite job, but now I think I need more power. I hope to share you more beautiful moments of the world.

<p>Those of us who have been sexually assaulted often have out-of-body experiences.  The violence we have gone through leaves us feeling disconnected with a lack of autonomy over our physical selves. To symbolize this sense of physical alienation, participants in A Serpent’s Voice are coated in 3 layers of liquid latex representing the abuse and pain that each participant has carried for years. It is a painful yet cathartic process to rip off this dead layer as an act of reconciliation and reconnection with our bodies. These photos capture a moment of reflection and empowerment as we choose to peel away the damage in our pasts. When it is presented in gallery settings this photo series will be accompanied by audio of participants telling their stories and jars containing the latex “skin” they removed.</p>

<p>We are Alexandra Dietz and Heather Ross.  Alexandra is an award-winning documentary photographer, Fulbright Scholar, and survivor who has traveled to over thirty countries documenting the fallout of sexual violence.  Heather Ross is a highly involved activist, a product manager for a game company, and survivor who learned to find catharsis through various forms of art.</p>
<p>Contributors will help us cover the cost of the expenses for making this series and getting it into galleries for people to experience firsthand.  The more we raise the more we will be able to do and the more lives we will be able to touch.  If you want to impact change through art, contribute. </p>
<p>We are asking for $5,000 to cover the costs of latex, photo editing, audio editing, film editing, research, gallery submissions, gallery-quality prints, and travel. The latex needed to create this series is a significant expense, with the materials costing approximately $100 per shoot (this does not include time and costs of editing or printing). The more we raise, the more participants we can afford to include and the more stories will be heard.  A portion of print sales will go to The Kind Clinic PrEP program who enthusiastically supports A Serpent's Voice.  The Kind Clinic is a full-service sexual health and wellness clinic dedicated to the treatment and prevention of sexually transmitted infections, including access to the HIV prevention drugs commonly known as PrEP and PEP.  Kind Clinic is dedicated to providing state-of-the-art sexual health and wellness services to all members of the LGBTQ community and allies, regardless of race, creed, gender or sexual orientation. <a href=""https://kindclinic.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://kindclinic.org/</a></p>
<p>If we don't reach our full goal, the funds will be used to cover the expenses we have already incurred, and to continue making the series to the extent possible depending on the amount raised while we look for other funding options.</p>

<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>A Serpent’s Voice prints are potent images of confronting the past and choosing your future self. With a print of your own, you’ll be reminded of the power of healing and renewal, as well as your part of making this project happen.</p>

<p>Art impacts everyone.  We live and breathe it.  Help us share it with the world.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>We are queer women speaking out about our experiences with sexual violence. In doing this, we risk losing friends and family, job opportunities, and being trolled or doxed online.  Most people in this project have not shared their stories so publicly before and we support each other throughout this process and beyond.  We have invested our own money, time, effort, and energy into bringing A Serpent’s Voice to life. It is so incredibly important to us, we believe in it passionately and hope that you do too. Help us change the world through art. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Environment Europe is a sustainability think tank based in Oxford.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our project is hugely valuable to the world because ecosystems are under threat, half of the world's biodiversity has been lost according to WWF in the past 40 years. The photographer, Dr Stanislav Shmelev has worked for the International Union for Conservation of Nature and proposed a new way to assess ecosystems and biodiversity using multi-criteria tools.  This book will illustrate the multiple dimensions of what ecosystems 'do', from oxygen production to water purification, production of food, generation of soils, carbon sequestration and pollination but also inspiration for artists and cultural and educational values.</li>
<li>Dr Stanislav Shmelev (<a href=""http://stanislav.photography/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stanislav.photography</a>) is an award-winning photographer and ecological economist and has been leading Environment Europe since its foundation in 2004. He is the author and editor of bestselling books, 'Ecological Economics: Sustainability in Practice' (Springer, 2012): <a href=""https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9789400719712"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9789400719712</a> and 'Green Economy Reader' (Springer, 2017): <a href=""https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319389172"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319389172</a>.

</div></div>","Short Summary

Environment Europe is a sustainability think tank based in Oxford. It has been instrumental in providing cutting-edge research and education in sustainability, the programme of executive Summer and Winter Schools in Ecological Economics has been attended by participants from 53 different countries, including Canada, USA, Mexico, Ecuador, Costa Rica, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Argentina, UK, France, Germany, Austria, Switzeland, Spain, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Norway, Serbia, Bosnia, Croatia, Albania, Latvia, Ghana, Nigeria, Jordan, Lebanon, Sri Lanka, China, India, Bhutan, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, and Australia. The participants of our programmes included representatives of UNEP, UNDP, ILO, WWF, OECD, IUCN, European Commission, GGGI, GIZ, government departments, companies and leading universities.
We are aiming to raise £10000 to start production of 'Ecosystems', a beautiful coffee-table photo album that will communicate the complexity and diversity of world's ecosystems and illustrate a simple idea that we entirely depend on the ecosystems and the natural world and that money cannot be a measuring rod to assess its value..
The required funds will go towards producing the first 500 copies of the book.


What We Need & What You Get

The £10000 we seek will go towards producing the first 500 copies of the album many of which will be distributed in universities, libraries and NGOs all around the world.
The following packages are available:
£99 This subscription package will entitle you to one copy of 'Ecosystems', signed by the author (upon request);
£499 This subscription package will entitle you to one copy of the book, 'Ecosystems', signed by the author (upon request) plus a 60x40cm framed print on paper of any of the images from the book (you will be able to communicate your wish after receiving your copy). Your name or the name of your organization will be mentioned on our website.
£999 This subscription package will entitle you to one copy of the book, 'Ecosystems', signed by the author (upon request) plus a museum quality 60x40cm print on aluminium under acrylic glass of any image from the book. Your name or the name of your organization will be mentioned on our website ;
£4999 This exclusive package will entitle you to one copy of 'Ecosystems', signed by the author, plus a 180x120cm museum quality unique print on aluminium under acrylic glass of any image from the book. Your name or the name of your organization will be mentioned on our website in a special section.


If we do not reach the entire goal we will start with a smaller number of copies (100-200).


The Impact
Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:

Our project is hugely valuable to the world because ecosystems are under threat, half of the world's biodiversity has been lost according to WWF in the past 40 years. The photographer, Dr Stanislav Shmelev has worked for the International Union for Conservation of Nature and proposed a new way to assess ecosystems and biodiversity using multi-criteria tools.  This book will illustrate the multiple dimensions of what ecosystems 'do', from oxygen production to water purification, production of food, generation of soils, carbon sequestration and pollination but also inspiration for artists and cultural and educational values.
Dr Stanislav Shmelev (stanislav.photography) is an award-winning photographer and ecological economist and has been leading Environment Europe since its foundation in 2004. He is the author and editor of bestselling books, 'Ecological Economics: Sustainability in Practice' (Springer, 2012): https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9789400719712 and 'Green Economy Reader' (Springer, 2017): https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319389172. Dr Shmelev exhibited his photography in Austria, Dubai, Germany, Peru, Russia, Spain and the UK at venues, which include the United Nations, Global Landscapes Forum, Royal College of Art, Price Galitzine Library, Brighton Photo Biennial, Fotonoviembre de Tenerife, Format, St Ives Arts Club, Debut Contemporary, O3 Gallery etc.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The IDEA</strong></p>
<p><i>All of the Lights</i> is a photo experience that encapsulates the art of still photography with the motion, the speed, and most importantly – the illuminating ambience of a dynamic city atmosphere. There are times you may not notice it, but we are instinctively attracted to sources of light. Each photograph in this collection represents the feeling a person receives when light is embraced; even the smallest flicker of light can provide a feeling of warmth, optimism, and hope.</p>
<p>Can you describe the feeling of looking up at an enormous Ferris Wheel, during a calm evening carnival? Have you ever experienced a sunset while being surrounded by some of the tallest skyscrapers in the world?

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The GOAL</strong></p>
<p>My goal is to create a photo book that captures beautiful scenes containing various light sources from my personal perspective. In order to do that, I'll need your help! I'm looking to raise a total of $8,000 to produce, publish, and distribute <i>All of the Lights</i>. Each contributor to the production of a photo book will receive a signed premium hardcover book. These limited edition copies are 12"" x 7.5"" in size and has a smooth glossy finish throughout. In other words...this piece is perfect coffee table book!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong> The INSPIRATION</strong></p>
<p>The inspiration for this book comes from a place of wanting to connect more. Before this spring (2020), I believe I took the feeling of being outdoors for granted. As human beings, we're meant to be outside - we're meant to interact with our environment - and most importantly, we're meant to interact with each other. Each image in the <i>All of the Lights</i> photo book represents an authentic scene. I share my authenticity of that scene through this camera lens experience.</p>
<p>A shared experience is also meant to discussed. I want the images in this book to strike  conversion between family, friends, and associates. Where is this place? What time of day is it? How was this shot taken? In a time where social distancing has, and will probably become the norm, this book is something that can bring us together!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The EXPERIENCE</strong></p>
<p>This book represents the human experience. It represents the feeling a person has when he or she steps out the door each and every day. This book represents the passion, connection, and authenticity I bring through this lens. If you can appreciate that perspective, please contribute to this campaign in any way you can.</p>
<p>Let's get the word out and make some noise about this photo book! Sharing is caring, so follow myself and Ether Media and let me know if any of my stuff is dope!</p>

Trabajaron acercándose a la crisis a su manera, dando lo mejor de sí. En catorce países, desde México a Argentina, registraron lo que vieron a su alrededor, y en algunos casos, dentro de sus propios hogares. Pero este no es un libro sólo sobre catástrofe. Hay dolor y muerte aquí, pero también hay vida nueva y el ocasional destello de esperanza. ” Jon Lee Anderson és periodista, corresponsal de guerra, escritor de la revista The New Yorker y firma el texto de introducción del libro.[EN] “In 2020, in an original endeavour to bear witness to the pandemic as it surged across the hemisphere, nine women and nine men around Latin America came together to form a new collective, COVID-Latam. They then went to work, each approaching the crisis in their own way, as best as they were able. In fourteen countries, from Mexico to Argentina, they chronicled what they saw around them, and in a few cases, within their own homes. But this is not a book only about a catastrophe. There is pain and death here, but there is also new life and an occasional glimpse of hope.” From the introduction by Jon Lee Anderson,  journalist, war correspondent, and writer for The New Yorker magazine.  El Fotolibro Red Flag nace como resultado del premio obtenido en la Convocatoria del FotoEvidence con WorldPressPhoto.​ En esta campaña tienes la posibilidad de apoyar el trabajo del colectivo Covid Latam y conseguir uno de los 1000 ejemplares del libro Red Flag a un valor promocional de preventa de $30 dólares, un 45% menos que el valor de venta que el libro tendrá en mostradores a partir de mediados de Abril. [EN] The Red Flag was the winner of the FotoEvidence Book Award with WorldPressPhoto. In this campaign you have the possibility to support the work of the Covid Latam collective and get one of the 1000 copies of the Red Flag book at a promotional pre-sale value of $ 30 dollars, 45% less than the retail price of the book when it comes off the press in mid-April. Cuando la pandemia de COVID-19 llegó a Santiago de Chile, la fotógrafa Tamara Merino pasó 146 días totalmente encerrada en su apartamento, junto con su hijo y su madre.

Diciembre 2020, por Glorianna Ximendaz En América Latina, el coronavirus ha puesto al descubierto la desigualdad extrema en la región, y un símbolo de esa desigualdad es la bandera roja en Colombia. Los colombianos empobrecidos cuelgan un trozo de tela roja fuera de sus casas cuando ya no tienen comida; es un llamado de ayuda y un recordatorio de que muchas personas viven de lo que ganan en el día a día, sin una red de seguridad. Si bien algunas familias pueden ponerse en cuarentena de manera segura, muchas otras corren el riesgo de pasar hambre y ser desalojadas si dejan de trabajar incluso por un día. Aquellos que cuelgan la bandera roja fuera de sus hogares dependen de la ayuda y solidaridad de los demás para sobrevivir.[EN] In Latin America, coronavirus has laid bare extreme inequality in the region, and one symbol of that inequality is the red flag in Colombia. Impoverished Colombians hang a piece of red fabric outside their homes when they no longer have any food – it is a call for help and a reminder that many people live off what they earn from one day to the next with no safety net. While some families can quarantine safely, others risk hunger and eviction if they stop working even for a day. Those who hang the red flag outside their homes depend on the generosity of others for survival. Una mujer y su hijo miran por la ventana en la que cuelga un trapo rojo como señal de que no tienen dinero ni comida y no pueden salir a trabajar por la pandemia.

<h3>“You are
important because you exist and your circumstances do not define you.”</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<h3>
</h3>This has been the motto and foundation to our classes since <b>Picture Change </b>began in 2011. <div>
<br/><p>In April and May of 2015, Picture Change founder Kate Gazaway will be in a community near <b>Chichigalpa, Nicaragua</b> <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">in partnership with New Song Mission Nicaragua. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Many of the people in this area suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease, resulting in sickness and early death. This is a major contributor to the extreme poverty in the region. International media has been covering this epidemic for the past few years, but, f</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">or the first time, we are providing an opportunity for those living in the affected communities to share their perspective.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Picture Change will be providing local high school-age students with</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> digital storytelling resources, eight weeks of photography training, and access to social media platforms to share the reality of their lives and community. This will not only foster <i>confidence</i> and <i>leadership skills</i> within the students, but also provide a pro-active way to play a role in how their story is told.</span></p>
<p>Students will have the opportunity to use their new skills in a <b>“Giving Back Day,”</b> where they will the provide the photography for family portraits in the community at no
charge. Near the end of the project, we'll host two <b>Gallery Shows</b> of the
students’ photography: one in the city of León, a major tourist location and
university area, and the other in the students’ home town of Chichigalpa.
This is a tangible way for the students to be celebrated and treated as
professional photographers in addition to making their family and neighbors
proud. </p>
<p>For
the final week of training, the students will travel out of the area (some, for the first time) to
the northern mountains of Nicaragua and participate in a creative service
project utilizing their new photography skills to help others.</p>
<p>When I discussed this project with the communications director at a local aid organization, I said “We are going to
teach them a new way to tell their own story.” <br/></p>
<p>He replied, <b>“That’s just it: no
one has asked them to tell their story. It won’t be a new way, it will be the
first time anyone has asked.”</b></p>
<p>Give the gift of <i>story</i>. Give the
gift of <i>hope</i>. This project has the <i>opportunity</i> to become the gift of a better life for
the youth of Chichigalpa. </p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h4>We need a total of $7,800 to make this project happen. This will cover Kate's living expenses in Nicaragua and conducting this project at no charge to the students.</h4>
<h4>
<br/>Consider sponsoring:<br/>
</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Camera and Training for a Student <i>($450/per student)</i></b>: This supports the costs surrounding the donated
cameras, transportation, renting a classroom in the community, a translator, and maintenance of
our gear for our students.<span><span> <br/></span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span><span> </span></span><b>Uniforms <span><span></span></span><i>($35)</i></b><i>:</i> Give one, Get one. We are providing a “uniform” (t-shirt) for each
of the students and staff on this project. This is a step to promote confidence and participation amongst
the students and community.<span><span> </span></span>If you buy one for yourself, it will provide a
t-shirt for our team in Chichigalpa. </li>
<li> <b><span><span></span></span>Family Portrait Day in Chichigalpa<span><span> <i>(</i></span></span><i>$150)</i></b>: <span><span></span></span>The students will use their new photography
skills to provide free family portraits in the area.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>Gallery Show in Leon <i>(<span><span></span></span>$350)</i></b>:<span><span>
</span></span>Leon is the closest city to Chichigalpa. It has
a growing arts scene and is a destination for tourists. This cost covers
renting a gallery space, printing photos, food, advertising, and transportation
of students’ families to the city.</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>Gallery Show in Chichigalpa <i>($175)</i></b>: This is a gallery show in the students’
community displaying photos from their service project in the northern mountains of Nicaragua. It is a tangible way to celebrate the students and give
their families something to be proud of. 
Cost covers printing photos, food, advertising for the show, and the
students get to keep their photos after the gallery. </li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>Field Trips <i>($250)</i></b>: Covers transportation and food. Our
students rarely, if ever, get out of these affected communities surrounded by a
sea of sugarcane. These field trips to the ocean and nearby city will allow
them to experience an entirely different view of their own country, give them
the opportunity to use their new photography skills in a “safe” place away from
their everyday life, and encourage a new perspective on life by having a little
fun. </li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span><b>Service Trip<span><span> <i>(</i></span></span><i>$375/per student)</i></b>: In May, we are traveling to a coffee
farm in northern Nicaragua, and partnering with Comunidad Connect, an
organization doing amazing work in community development for the area. The
students will create a media campaign to
raise funds and awareness for Comunidad Connect.<span><span></span></span> <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>This trip serves many purposes:</i><br/>     <i><b>Empowerment</b></i>:  These students may live below the poverty line, but they have a voice. Picture Change is merely providing the resources and opportunity to use it, allowing them to give of their own talents instead of receiving charity. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">     <i><b>Employment</b></i>: Rosa, one of our former students from 2011, has started her own business providing much-needed photography services to her community, whether it's ID photos or event photography. These students will be trained to do the same. Also, due to the flow of journalists and tourists to this area, students will have the opportunity to be employed as assistants or photo-guides, providing an income for their families and serving as ambassadors to their community. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-style: italic;"">Confidence</b></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">: We have witnessed the transformative power of digital storytelling in our students since 2011. Through photography and social media platforms, the students play a direct role in creating better lives for others and acting as the documentarians for their community, sharing their story with the world.</span></p>
<p>     <i><b>Hope</b></i>: How powerful are the words, ""I see what you are going through and I hear what you have to say,"" ? Instead of focusing on the poverty and death that thrives in Chichigalpa, our class will focus on life, family bonds, dreams for the future, and the natural beauty that surrounds these students. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Profits from the students' photography sales go directly back to them and their families, thus the work they create can literally save lives by putting food on their table, funding education, or providing medicine. </span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Picture Change has never purchased a camera and has operated these past four years through the generous camera donations of so many. <p>We are still in need of:</p>
<p><b>Gear</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>iPhones</i>: We are teaching the students how to incorporate their art and stories into social media, and an iPhone is a valuable asset to that. In addition to the camera quality, we use them to record audio interviews to incorporate into our media. </li>
<li>
<i>Macbook Air</i> or small laptop computer: This will be used by Kate for uploading, editing, sharing, and teaching with the students. She will be traveling back and forth from the community and around the country with all of the camera gear, so something small and lightweight is tremendously helpful. </li>
<li>
<i>Compact photo printer</i>: this will be donated to the local partner organization after the project is completed so they can continue to photograph and print families in Chichigalpa.</li>
<li>
<i>Compact point and shoot cameras.</i> We are looking for cameras 6megapixels or above. Please include all chargers, memory cards, etc. </li>
<li>
<i>Fuji Instax Camera/ Film</i>: when we travel to rural areas, it is a tremendous gift to be able to <i>give</i> photos instead of just taking them. </li>
</ul>
<div><b>Skymiles</b></div>
<div><ul><li>One of the biggest expenses is the plane ticket for Kate to get to Nicaragua. If you have Skymiles with Delta that you are able to transfer to Kate, please contact us for the next step. Picture Change can reimburse the cost of transferring them if necessary. </li></ul></div>
<p><b>Awareness</b></p>
<p>Do you interact with other humans? Do you use the internet? Do you like what Picture Change is doing?</p>
<p>Then talk about it! We at Picture Change love our students and love what we do, and the more people who hear about what's happening the better! Maybe you don't have money or gear, but you have a voice and that is very powerful.  </p>
<p>Use the IndieGoGo Share Tools to raise awareness of the work Picture Change is doing. That has an enormous impact on our mission!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Thank You. Gracias. </h3>
<div>For real. None of this could happen without you. This world has become so small and so connected via the internet, and what affects our friends across the world affects us here at home whether we know it or not. We are grateful for your encouragement and support, and I know our students will be too.</div>
<div>So thank you. Let's stay in touch and change the world, or at least our corner of it. </div>

International media has been covering this epidemic for the past few years, but, for the first time, we are providing an opportunity for those living in the affected communities to share their perspective.
Picture Change will be providing local high school-age students with digital storytelling resources, eight weeks of photography training, and access to social media platforms to share the reality of their lives and community. This will not only foster confidence and leadership skills within the students, but also provide a pro-active way to play a role in how their story is told.
Students will have the opportunity to use their new skills in a “Giving Back Day,” where they will the provide the photography for family portraits in the community at no
charge. Near the end of the project, we'll host two Gallery Shows of the
students’ photography: one in the city of León, a major tourist location and
university area, and the other in the students’ home town of Chichigalpa.
This is a tangible way for the students to be celebrated and treated as
professional photographers in addition to making their family and neighbors
proud. 
For
the final week of training, the students will travel out of the area (some, for the first time) to
the northern mountains of Nicaragua and participate in a creative service
project utilizing their new photography skills to help others.
When I discussed this project with the communications director at a local aid organization, I said “We are going to
teach them a new way to tell their own story.” 
He replied, “That’s just it: no
one has asked them to tell their story. It won’t be a new way, it will be the
first time anyone has asked.”
Give the gift of story. Give the
gift of hope. This project has the opportunity to become the gift of a better life for
the youth of Chichigalpa. 


What We Need & What You Get
We need a total of $7,800 to make this project happen. This will cover Kate's living expenses in Nicaragua and conducting this project at no charge to the students.

Consider sponsoring:



Camera and Training for a Student ($450/per student): This supports the costs surrounding the donated
cameras, transportation, renting a classroom in the community, a translator, and maintenance of
our gear for our students. 


 Uniforms ($35): Give one, Get one. We are providing a “uniform” (t-shirt) for each
of the students and staff on this project. This is a step to promote confidence and participation amongst
the students and community. If you buy one for yourself, it will provide a
t-shirt for our team in Chichigalpa. 
 Family Portrait Day in Chichigalpa ($150): The students will use their new photography
skills to provide free family portraits in the area.

Gallery Show in Leon ($350):
Leon is the closest city to Chichigalpa. It has
a growing arts scene and is a destination for tourists. This cost covers
renting a gallery space, printing photos, food, advertising, and transportation
of students’ families to the city.

Gallery Show in Chichigalpa ($175): This is a gallery show in the students’
community displaying photos from their service project in the northern mountains of Nicaragua. It is a tangible way to celebrate the students and give
their families something to be proud of. 
Cost covers printing photos, food, advertising for the show, and the
students get to keep their photos after the gallery. 

Field Trips ($250): Covers transportation and food. Our
students rarely, if ever, get out of these affected communities surrounded by a
sea of sugarcane. These field trips to the ocean and nearby city will allow
them to experience an entirely different view of their own country, give them
the opportunity to use their new photography skills in a “safe” place away from
their everyday life, and encourage a new perspective on life by having a little
fun. 

Service Trip ($375/per student): In May, we are traveling to a coffee
farm in northern Nicaragua, and partnering with Comunidad Connect, an
organization doing amazing work in community development for the area. The
students will create a media campaign to
raise funds and awareness for Comunidad Connect. 





The Impact
This trip serves many purposes:     Empowerment:  These students may live below the poverty line, but they have a voice. Picture Change is merely providing the resources and opportunity to use it, allowing them to give of their own talents instead of receiving charity. 
     Employment: Rosa, one of our former students from 2011, has started her own business providing much-needed photography services to her community, whether it's ID photos or event photography. These students will be trained to do the same. Also, due to the flow of journalists and tourists to this area, students will have the opportunity to be employed as assistants or photo-guides, providing an income for their families and serving as ambassadors to their community. 
Confidence: We have witnessed the transformative power of digital storytelling in our students since 2011. Through photography and social media platforms, the students play a direct role in creating better lives for others and acting as the documentarians for their community, sharing their story with the world.
     Hope: How powerful are the words, ""I see what you are going through and I hear what you have to say,"" ? Instead of focusing on the poverty and death that thrives in Chichigalpa, our class will focus on life, family bonds, dreams for the future, and the natural beauty that surrounds these students. Profits from the students' photography sales go directly back to them and their families, thus the work they create can literally save lives by putting food on their table, funding education, or providing medicine. 


Other Ways You Can HelpPicture Change has never purchased a camera and has operated these past four years through the generous camera donations of so many. We are still in need of:
Gear



iPhones: We are teaching the students how to incorporate their art and stories into social media, and an iPhone is a valuable asset to that. In addition to the camera quality, we use them to record audio interviews to incorporate into our media. 

Macbook Air or small laptop computer: This will be used by Kate for uploading, editing, sharing, and teaching with the students. She will be traveling back and forth from the community and around the country with all of the camera gear, so something small and lightweight is tremendously helpful. 

Compact photo printer: this will be donated to the local partner organization after the project is completed so they can continue to photograph and print families in Chichigalpa.

Compact point and shoot cameras. We are looking for cameras 6megapixels or above. Please include all chargers, memory cards, etc. 

Fuji Instax Camera/ Film: when we travel to rural areas, it is a tremendous gift to be able to give photos instead of just taking them. 

Skymiles
One of the biggest expenses is the plane ticket for Kate to get to Nicaragua. If you have Skymiles with Delta that you are able to transfer to Kate, please contact us for the next step. Picture Change can reimburse the cost of transferring them if necessary. 
Awareness
Do you interact with other humans? Do you use the internet? Do you like what Picture Change is doing?
Then talk about it! We at Picture Change love our students and love what we do, and the more people who hear about what's happening the better! Maybe you don't have money or gear, but you have a voice and that is very powerful.  
Use the IndieGoGo Share Tools to raise awareness of the work Picture Change is doing. That has an enormous impact on our mission!


Thank You. Gracias. 
For real. None of this could happen without you. This world has become so small and so connected via the internet, and what affects our friends across the world affects us here at home whether we know it or not. We are grateful for your encouragement and support, and I know our students will be too.
So thank you. Let's stay in touch and change the world, or at least our corner of it.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<div><br/></div>
<p>Hello and thank you for looking at our funding campaign.</p>
<p>My name is Jay Keim. I am a long time Lawrence Resident  I am a Musician, Photographer, Father and I am passionate about our wonderful town. Lawrence, Kansas is an oasis and the new Art District is an example of why this city is listed often as one of the best small cities in America.  And one main thing that is missing from the Art District and the City is a place for up coming and established photographers  to have Studio Space and Darkroom facilities for their use.   And for young photographers our High Schools are closing down their darkrooms.  Film, Like vinyl records, is making a very strong comeback as aficionados of the Art know there  is really nothing quite like it.  We need a professional quality Darkroom Facility in town for people to use.</p>
<p>We won't be just for the Film users. We plan to have all the needs for the Digital Photographers and Video Artists to use including computers loaded with the proper software, Professional quality  printers and workstations. The studio space can also be set up with a green screen for the videographers in the area to use.</p>
<p>The Studio space will be very important as there is never a space like this for the public to use.  The have access to a Professional Studio, complete with lights and backdrops, is every new Photographers dream come true!  This will be an amazing space!</p>
<p>Plus the space we have picked has a very large Gallery area.  Lawrence has a Final Friday event where  on the last Friday of every month the town opens it's doors to the Artists in town to show off their Art.  We will be right in the middle of the Lawrence Art District and the Gallery space will be a highlight for Photographers to show off and sell their Art.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What we are looking for to get this project up and running is a beginning budget of Twenty Thousand dollars. With this amount we can buy the equipment needed to begin and pay as much rent in advance as possible. Much of the equipment, especially the Darkroom equipment, is very reasonably priced and a complete large Darkroom can be set up for just a few thousand dollars. We are hoping for donations of equipment too such as Film and Digital cameras that be rented or checked out for students to use. We have carpenter friends lined up who will donate their time and skills if anything like that is needed.</p>
<p>We know that the key  to this project is sustainability.  We will offer memberships,  rent the studio space and offer classes and workshops in Photography, Darkroom, Printmaking, Video Production and more. Plus the Gallery space. All of this will, we are certain, be enough to sustain this project. The Art Community here is large and Vibrant and the community is very supportive of the Arts.</p>
<p>And with enough funding we will be able to offer all of our services to those who cannot afford it.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Look at the perks we will give you for your donation!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Your Donation and the creation of this facility will bring to Lawrence a space for young and old alike to have a professional quality photographic studio for their own use. Nothing like it exists!  The impact to the community could easily be the next great young photographer!</p>

<div>Our story began on my boat in the Florida Keys while scheduling my travel for glamour and beauty photoshoots.  I myself was greying  at 17, my mom at 14 and those experiences have a way of showing up, when there's something whose time is come.  Ready to be born from us, memories turn into flourishing projects and enter our awareness with synchronicity messages and good feelings.  That was my experience as I was moving more and more into that passion of ""Silver Hair, Don't Care"" photoshoot scheduling and loving every minute of it.  Many (might I say triple digit) subjects later and 60 worldwide beauties now featured in 'Faces of Silver', the book, roughly 120 page book began with me, what is now a movement.  This project is now in manuscript book form and with baited breath awaiting to be published, 'Faces of Silver'.  And as I say, ""It's not over until me and the Silver Women get to sing and you have your 'Faces of Silver' book.""  Yes, we are inviting you to be included in this movement, this cause!

CHARLOTTE, NC -- Women all across the nation are taking a stand against what society has deemed, ""beautiful.""
Thousands of women are ditching the hair dye for a more natural approach.
Ben Winkler, a Los Angeles-based photographer, has been traveling across the nation documenting those beautiful women.
""It's basically a project to bring the awareness to society at large,"" Winkler said. ""How do we have the audacity to judge women by what their age is, who are are we to tell them what's right what's wrong?""
Winkler's movement called ""Faces of Silver"" has given women the confidence to go gray.

""How can we show that there's still that radiance and that luster in there, and that gray does not mean doubt,"" Winkler said.
Winkler's project began two years ago. He used the photos he took and turned them a book to be published as a coffee table book.
His campaign had a large impact on one Charlotte woman.
""It doesn't have to be about age,"" Priscilla Walters said. ""Everyone is really special and it doesn't mean that you have aged it means that you have saged to me. It means that you have beauty and we have to embrace it.""
Winkler has created an IndieGoGo to help fund his ""Faces Of Silver"" book, click here to donate. Share your photos of your silver hair with us using #Facesofsilver.

Our story began on my boat in the Florida Keys while scheduling my travel for glamour and beauty photoshoots.  I myself was greying  at 17, my mom at 14 and those experiences have a way of showing up, when there's something whose time is come.  Ready to be born from us, memories turn into flourishing projects and enter our awareness with synchronicity messages and good feelings.  That was my experience as I was moving more and more into that passion of ""Silver Hair, Don't Care"" photoshoot scheduling and loving every minute of it.  Many (might I say triple digit) subjects later and 60 worldwide beauties now featured in 'Faces of Silver', the book, roughly 120 page book began with me, what is now a movement.  This project is now in manuscript book form and with baited breath awaiting to be published, 'Faces of Silver'.  And as I say, ""It's not over until me and the Silver Women get to sing and you have your 'Faces of Silver' book.""  Yes, we are inviting you to be included in this movement, this cause! Become a part of this movement, get your book and share with others!   BW

Little Updates Along My 'Faces of Silver' Tour





Ben created such a loving and 'Faces of Silver' community and world interest by photo journaling  on social media.  The testimony comments from participants to those of fellow FaceBook or Instagramers fueled his project as Ben shared, 

""Faces Of Silver' - the project www.FacesOfSilver.com playful, joyful & easy with great energy in the mix makes this project so rewarding! Haven't had this much fun in a long time!""

And there are many more places after this leg of Ben's trip.
Even Beautiful Silvers and Their Loves (and their stories) Were a Part of 'Faces of Silver'



Ben Winkler :  Oh boy, my entire day, wait, entire tour just got turned upside down! I just got reminded of humanity, kindness, and most of all love! I was fortunate to witness a most beautiful couple interact with each other. It brought back why I do what I do, to capture moments, to show tenderness and to tell the story my subjects allow me to tell!

Kuleshova just got selected as one of 12 participants of Joop Swart Masterclass in 2018. Her work <i>ABKHAZIA</i> is a portrait of a country caught in a two decade long slumber without no sign of waking in sight.

In <i>Lo que elijo de mí misma – What do I elect from myself</i> she did a three months photo workshop with Latin American women living in Berlin and helped them to express their personal stories through the camera.</p><p><a href=""http://www.mariasturm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Maria Sturm</a>'s new work <i>You don't look Native to me</i> already got a lot recognition in the photo scene. In her work about the unrecognised Lumbee tribe of North Carolina, Sturm engages an unfamiliar mix of concepts: a Native American tribe whose members are ignored by the outside world, who do not wear their otherness on their physique, but who are firm in their identity. Sturm's work is not giving a typical reproduction of Native Americans, but questioning and problematizing the identity crisis of her informants and by that creating a new image of her theme.</p><p>Argentinian based photographer <a href=""http://www.sarahpabst.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sarah Pabst</a>, mainly focuses on women and identity topics, besides her personal intimate work. In her presented work <i>Zukunft</i> Papst is challenging the history of her German family. By mixing up archival material and current photographs, she is able to tell a story that probably wouldn't be possible to tell otherwise. In <i>Zukunft </i>the past and the present morph together into a new future.</p><p>Danish artist <a href=""http://www.sisselthastum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sissel Thastum</a> is co-founder of the non-profit art organisation <a href=""http://www.theindependentair.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Independent AIR</a>, which organises artist residencies in Denmark and internationally. In Beyond II she is showing her very personal story <i>I am here when you are here</i>. Through the nature, the landscape and the feminine form, her work mediates a close and intimate relationship between mother and daughter. By a very poetic picture language Thastum's personal work gets universal.</p><p>Characterized by an international background, <a href=""http://www.vonbuedingen.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Snezhana von Buedingen</a> focuses on the exploration of people, culture, and life. In her portrait series <i>Meeting Sofie</i>, von Buedingen depicts the life of a nineteen year-old girl with Down Syndrome. With a very sensitive and dreamy gaze she shows Sofie's emotional world, perhaps not so different from our own.</p><h3> </h3><h3>The Team</h3><p>The magazine’s text focusing on women in humanistic photography, will be authored by <a href=""http://www.foto-diskurs.info"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Miriam Zlobinski</a>, the renowned art historian, photo-editor and curator. The layout and graphic design of Beyond II will be done by the esteemed Dutch graphic designer Emmy van Thiel of <a href=""http://thevisualtheatre.nl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Visual Theatre</a>. The publisher and curator of Beyond is <a href=""http://www.julianeherrmann.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Juliane Herrmann</a>. Juliane is a photographer herself and just published successfully her book ""Man among Men"" via crowd funding. The magazine will be printed on real newsprint by Rheinisch-Bergische Druckerei Duesseldorf. For both, the publisher and the printer it is a great experience to work together and to learn from each other.</p><p> </p><h3>Your Support</h3><p>Beyond is published in English and will be distributed for free at photo festivals such as the ""Lumix - Festival for Young Photojournalism"" in Hanover and ""Visa pour l'image - International Festival of Photojournalism"" in Perpignan. To make this free distribution possible we are asking for you to support the publication by helping finance the printing costs. In thanks for your support you can choose between several perks. Please have a look on the right side to see if a copy of the magazine, a signed fine art print by one of the artists or a sponsoring package might be interesting for you.</p><p> </p><h3>More than a magazine</h3><p>In addition to the magazine, there will be podium discussions in Berlin and Cologne where the participating artists, Miriam Zlobinski and other photographic experts will debate the position of women in humanistic photography. We are honoured to be working in cooperation with <a href=""http://gfhf.eu/home.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Society for Humanistic Photography</a>, which will host our podium discussion in Berlin. Each supporter of the crowd funding campaign will get a personal invitation to these discussions.</p><p> </p><h3>Beyond I</h3><p>Beyond got initiated with the need to show variety and different approaches in humanistic photography. The first issue of Beyond was released in 2016 during Lumix Festival for Young Photojournalism. On a guerilla action the participants distributed Beyond at the festival area of Lumix. Within some hours many hundred copies of Beyond were spread. This action was a great success and called a lot of attention. All in all distributed 2000 copies at various festivals, and sent the newspaper to photo editors, galleries and museums. The artists of Beyond I used their shared network to reach as many industry and cultural leaders as possible. The result: Beyond I was represented in several exhibitions, received extensive media coverage, and helped the photographers included in its pages gain much deserved attention. We expect Beyond II to makes waves as we address a very topical issue and have invited an outstanding group of a young female photographers to participate.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526254997/artd9qv7ah2zxncatvtu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Beyond at the guerilla slide show of Christoph Bangert at Lumix Festival in 2016</i></p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526255201/tkapufpjh1jvmqejusoj.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Beyond at Recontres d'Arles, 2016</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526255512/mn1dyxdmnkefapwyu7g7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Beyond at the Newsprint_Photobook exhibition at Dortmunder U, 2016</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526255607/lqewjizsdbpdsontjqb0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Beyond at the magazine of Rheinisch-Bergische Druckerei, 2016</i></p><p> </p><h3>We need you!</h3><p>By becoming a contributor you are supporting a valuable initiative that enables young photographers to network and engage in creative cooperation.

Like a Bird invites us to have a look at the circus culture of Iran, Afghanistan and the Gaza Strip, and makes us to rethink our preconceived image of these countries.The next high-flyer of Beyond II is the Russian photographer Ksenia Kuleshova. Kuleshova just got selected as one of 12 participants of Joop Swart Masterclass in 2018. Her work ABKHAZIA is a portrait of a country caught in a two decade long slumber without no sign of waking in sight. It researches the everyday life of people who try to exist within uncertainty, within a system that doesn’t have a future and doesn’t seek one.American artist Hayley Austin focuses on individual's relationships to one another and to their culture, and the way that these forces shape them. Austin's portraits show an amazing intimacy. Beyond will feature her work Narratives of Desire, which reveals carefully constructed sexual scenes made in collaboration with couples.The photographs of our next participant almost look like paintings. Lia Darjes' pictures of small unofficial markets in Kaliningrad act between documentary and staging and by that creating a completely new genre. With Tempora Morte, Darjes is interested in finding out how the still life genre can be positioned today by means of classic references.For Beyond II, visual anthropologist and artist Luiza Folegatti from Brazil did not photographed herself, but gave the camera to the women she wanted to learn more about. In Lo que elijo de mí misma – What do I elect from myself she did a three months photo workshop with Latin American women living in Berlin and helped them to express their personal stories through the camera.Maria Sturm's new work You don't look Native to me already got a lot recognition in the photo scene. In her work about the unrecognised Lumbee tribe of North Carolina, Sturm engages an unfamiliar mix of concepts: a Native American tribe whose members are ignored by the outside world, who do not wear their otherness on their physique, but who are firm in their identity. Sturm's work is not giving a typical reproduction of Native Americans, but questioning and problematizing the identity crisis of her informants and by that creating a new image of her theme.Argentinian based photographer Sarah Pabst, mainly focuses on women and identity topics, besides her personal intimate work. In her presented work Zukunft Papst is challenging the history of her German family. By mixing up archival material and current photographs, she is able to tell a story that probably wouldn't be possible to tell otherwise. In Zukunft the past and the present morph together into a new future.Danish artist Sissel Thastum is co-founder of the non-profit art organisation The Independent AIR, which organises artist residencies in Denmark and internationally. In Beyond II she is showing her very personal story I am here when you are here. Through the nature, the landscape and the feminine form, her work mediates a close and intimate relationship between mother and daughter. By a very poetic picture language Thastum's personal work gets universal.Characterized by an international background, Snezhana von Buedingen focuses on the exploration of people, culture, and life. In her portrait series Meeting Sofie, von Buedingen depicts the life of a nineteen year-old girl with Down Syndrome. With a very sensitive and dreamy gaze she shows Sofie's emotional world, perhaps not so different from our own. The TeamThe magazine’s text focusing on women in humanistic photography, will be authored by Miriam Zlobinski, the renowned art historian, photo-editor and curator. The layout and graphic design of Beyond II will be done by the esteemed Dutch graphic designer Emmy van Thiel of The Visual Theatre. The publisher and curator of Beyond is Juliane Herrmann. Juliane is a photographer herself and just published successfully her book ""Man among Men"" via crowd funding. The magazine will be printed on real newsprint by Rheinisch-Bergische Druckerei Duesseldorf. For both, the publisher and the printer it is a great experience to work together and to learn from each other. Your SupportBeyond is published in English and will be distributed for free at photo festivals such as the ""Lumix - Festival for Young Photojournalism"" in Hanover and ""Visa pour l'image - International Festival of Photojournalism"" in Perpignan. To make this free distribution possible we are asking for you to support the publication by helping finance the printing costs. In thanks for your support you can choose between several perks. Please have a look on the right side to see if a copy of the magazine, a signed fine art print by one of the artists or a sponsoring package might be interesting for you. More than a magazineIn addition to the magazine, there will be podium discussions in Berlin and Cologne where the participating artists, Miriam Zlobinski and other photographic experts will debate the position of women in humanistic photography. We are honoured to be working in cooperation with The Society for Humanistic Photography, which will host our podium discussion in Berlin. Each supporter of the crowd funding campaign will get a personal invitation to these discussions. Beyond IBeyond got initiated with the need to show variety and different approaches in humanistic photography. The first issue of Beyond was released in 2016 during Lumix Festival for Young Photojournalism. On a guerilla action the participants distributed Beyond at the festival area of Lumix. Within some hours many hundred copies of Beyond were spread. This action was a great success and called a lot of attention. All in all distributed 2000 copies at various festivals, and sent the newspaper to photo editors, galleries and museums. The artists of Beyond I used their shared network to reach as many industry and cultural leaders as possible. The result: Beyond I was represented in several exhibitions, received extensive media coverage, and helped the photographers included in its pages gain much deserved attention. We expect Beyond II to makes waves as we address a very topical issue and have invited an outstanding group of a young female photographers to participate.Beyond at the guerilla slide show of Christoph Bangert at Lumix Festival in 2016Beyond at Recontres d'Arles, 2016Beyond at the Newsprint_Photobook exhibition at Dortmunder U, 2016Beyond at the magazine of Rheinisch-Bergische Druckerei, 2016 We need you!By becoming a contributor you are supporting a valuable initiative that enables young photographers to network and engage in creative cooperation.

Ethan Nadelmann, the founder of The Drug Policy Alliance and one of the pioneers of the medicinal marijuana legalization in the U.S., explains to us why the war on drugs is lost.
Wade Davis, ethnobotanist and explorer from Harvard University and probably the world’s leading expert on the coca plant and its significance to indigenous communities, explains why we are not just going to lose the coca as the basis of  the drug but the way of living of these people.
En mi esfuerzo por responder a todas estas inquietudes que plantea el mundo de las drogas, les traigo cuatro ensayos cada uno presentando una experiencia personal. Estos textos tienen como objetivo presentar la complejidad y diversidad de actores involucrados en esta guerra perdida. Los colaboradores son:
Karl Penhaul, periodista internacional que me acompañó durante este proceso, nos guía a través de las vicisitudes y alegrías que debe pasar uno para comprender el mundo de las drogas.
El chamán amazónico Calitxo Kuiru nos guía a través del significado espiritual de la coca para su comunidad.
Ethan Nadelmann, fundador de The Drug Policy Alliance y uno de los pioneros de la legalización de la marihuana medicinal en los E.E.U.U., nos explica por qué la guerra contra las drogas está perdida.
Wade Davis, etno botánico y explorador de la Universidad de Harvard y el principal experto mundial sobre la planta de coca y su importancia para las comunidades indígenas, explica que si eliminamos la planta de coca, no sólo acabaremos con la droga sino con todas las culturas que adoran la planta.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I’m Erin Nelson, a New Orleans based photographer, and I am producing a solo photography gallery show about disappearing landscapes. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>Growing up in Southeast Louisiana, and living through numerous disasters, I've always been intrigued with the concept of change. This has led to me looking at not only urban landscapes changing due to natural and human influence, but also what will happen to landscapes in nature. Recently, I was watching the news, and saw a sliding scale of what will happen to major coastlines when the polar ice caps completely melt. This has been the major inspiration and driving force for this photographic series.</p>
<p>I wanted to focus on landscapes that will be gone within the next 10-15 years, more than likely, sooner. Due to climate, and numerous natural disasters (weather and hemispherical shifting) and man-made disasters (such as urbanization, economic communal shifts, oil/chemical spills) , the landscape around us is forever changing and/or disappearing. This is an on-going series due to the essence of this subject matter.</p>
<p>Why is this important? It’s important because these photographs capture the last fleeting moments of these places. I will be bringing these landscapes that are usually difficult to get to into a public space where people can access them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's Where the Funding is Going</h3>
<p>I am asking you for $2,500 in funding for this series. The funding will be 65% project, 35% perks. I have chosen flex funding, so if I don’t make my goal, I will still produce the show with what funds I have received. Projected gallery show date is May 2017, but this is subject to change.</p>
<p>Series funding of 65% ($1,625) will be going to pay for printing the photographs on aluminum (11x14 and 12x18 inch sizes), and to produce postcards and postage to advertise the opening. The reason for printing on aluminum will help to preserve the photographs so they can withstand humid gallery conditions, but also to last for generations to come. The remaining 35% ($875) will go to funding the perks that will be available to you the backers. These perks help show you my appreciation for backing this project.</p>
<p>Please take a look at the perks list. I’m offering unique prints, photo sessions in two locations in the US, and all will include you on the Contributor’s List that will be listed on not only my website, but also on a special placard in the gallery during the exhibition.</p>
<p>If I surpass my goal, I will be adding stretch goals of other prints and photographic services.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, we all know that landscapes change, but some of us are unfazed until we look at photos from years prior to these changes. I know from living in Louisiana, and dealing with hurricanes and oil spills, things can take drastic shifts quickly. This series gives visibility or visual aid to the effects of these shifts in communities, whether they maybe urban or in nature. In a way, the series is preserving instances in time through photography.  </p>
<p>With your donation, you will be supporting an artist with a desire to use her voice to help out a visualization to a growing problem.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risk and Solution</h3>
<p>With all projects and series, there will be risks and challenges.</p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Sophie Mayanne, I'm 24 years old and I am a photographer based in the Cotswolds, UK. For the past few months I have embarked on a personal project titled ""Behind The Scars"", which has already had an amazing response, with 60 people already taking part in the series. I want to photograph scars of all shapes and sizes, and share the incredible stories behind them.</p>
<h3>Why Scars?</h3>
<p>As a photographer, I have always been interested in photographing what society considers as ""flaws"" - and with this project I want people to see their scars in a new, positive light, and challenge you to think differently about your own skin, too! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496466707/uk0prknbqn9anuz1zxp9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Beckie, Shanti, Ashleigh, Ronnie &amp; Isabella for Behind The Scars. </i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why do I need you?</h3>
<p>So far, Behind The Scars has been entirely self-funded, with 3 studio shoots taking place in London, UK.</p>
<p>Each studio shoot costs <u><strong>£150.00,</strong></u> so if fully funded, I could add 6 additional shoot dates in the UK, allowing me to focus on getting as many people as possible involved!</p>
<h3><strong>What is the goal of Behind The Scars?</strong></h3>
<p>The ultimate goal of the series would be to create a book, however before I reach this point, there are many more people to photograph for the series! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496466914/sqqdz6tjyzmknszvj60l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Miriam for Behind The Scars. </i><i>""When I was 9 I fell off a swing on holiday and broke my arm quite badly. Being in hospital on holiday was a pain, but I made friends with the other kids on my ward and we remained pen pals for sometime after. My scar doesn't bother me at all, I forget it is there until someone else brings it up. ""​</i></p>
<h3>Can I follow the series as it progresses?</h3>
<p>Yes! The series will be regularly updated on my <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/sophiemayanne"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram account</a>, <a href=""http://behind-the-scars.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blog</a> and <a href=""http://www.sophie-mayanne.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> where you can follow the project as it grows!</p>
<h3>Can I be involved in the series?</h3>
<p>Yes! If you would like to be involved in the series yourself, you can email me on sophiemayanne@gmail.com. </p>

<p><i>Isabella for Behind The Scars. </i><i>""In the summer of '15 I was in a house fire. My clothes and way of life up in flames. I spent my summer in a burns unit on Fulham Road. My scars and scar tissue continue to change, but I have never felt more beautiful.""​</i></p>

As a photographer, I have always been interested in photographing what society considers as ""flaws"" - and with this project I want people to see their scars in a new, positive light, and challenge you to think differently about your own skin, too! 
 

Beckie, Shanti, Ashleigh, Ronnie & Isabella for Behind The Scars. 
 
Why do I need you?
So far, Behind The Scars has been entirely self-funded, with 3 studio shoots taking place in London, UK.
Each studio shoot costs £150.00, so if fully funded, I could add 6 additional shoot dates in the UK, allowing me to focus on getting as many people as possible involved!
What is the goal of Behind The Scars?
The ultimate goal of the series would be to create a book, however before I reach this point, there are many more people to photograph for the series! 
 

Miriam for Behind The Scars. ""When I was 9 I fell off a swing on holiday and broke my arm quite badly. Being in hospital on holiday was a pain, but I made friends with the other kids on my ward and we remained pen pals for sometime after. My scar doesn't bother me at all, I forget it is there until someone else brings it up. ""​
Can I follow the series as it progresses?
Yes! The series will be regularly updated on my Instagram account, Blog and website where you can follow the project as it grows!
Can I be involved in the series?
Yes! If you would like to be involved in the series yourself, you can email me on sophiemayanne@gmail.com. 

Isabella for Behind The Scars. ""In the summer of '15 I was in a house fire. My clothes and way of life up in flames. I spent my summer in a burns unit on Fulham Road. My scars and scar tissue continue to change, but I have never felt more beautiful.""​",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>&lt;&lt; Hi! I'm Alice, I'm 28 and I'm from Valdimontone Contrada in Siena. I have a bachelor degree in ""Modern Languages, Literatures and Cultures"" from Siena University and a master in ""Translation, Mediation and Interpretation"" from Bologna University. After the second degree I decided to come back to Siena because I missed my hometown, my family and my dogs! I want to stay and live where my roots are. I refuse to believe that the only way to find jobs is to leave Italy, like many other young people are forced to do nowadays. I took some courage and decided to create a project that reflects my job requirements and my personal interests. Now, I only hope that this story could have a happy ending! &gt;&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Giulia V</strong></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Hi! I'm Giulia, I'm 29 and I'm from Valdimontone Contrada in Siena. I have lived far away from Siena for more than 10 years, to study and work. I got a bachelor degree in ""Economics and Management"" and a master degree in ""Economics and Finance"" from Luiss University in Rome, then I got a ""Master in Finance"" from Nova University in Lisbon. I just completed my PhD in ""International Economics"" from the Graduate Institute of Geneva. I have lived in Switzerland for over 6 years. During this time I missed my hometown a lot. I always knew that it wouldn't be that easy to find a job in Italy. So I tried to think outside the box. I asked myself what was missing in the tourism landscape of Siena. I searched for something totally new that could engage visitors in a different way, using an old passion of mine: the instant photography.&gt;&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Giulia F</strong></p>
<p>&lt;&lt; Hi, I'm Giulia, I'm 29 and I'm from Tartuca Contrada in Siena. After graduating from the Scientific High School, I studied ""Medicine and Surgery"" in Siena University. Even though my education and background are strictly scientific, I coulnd't resist to POLAROAD's call. This project let me re-discover my hometown from a new point of view. I have learned about historical and cultural aspects that I have always taken for granted, even if I have never left my hometown. So my two friends involved me in POLAROAD. What I love the most about this project is the goal of valorizing Siena and creating something that belong to us deeply connected to our motherland.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>POLAROAD is our challenge! In an historical period when many people leave Italy to go abroad we want to stay! Everybody complaints that Italy is a place for old people where no opportunities are given to young ones. We want to prove it wrong, demonstrating that there is a space left also for us! We decided to invest in a young business which can enhance the beauty and cultural heritage of the town where we were born. We love Siena and we are deeply connected to it. Who, better than us that were born and lived here for so many years, can give you the best advice of what you can discover in it? </p>

<p>How intimidating is it to navigate through a new city for the first time? Do you wish you knew some locals that could give you some local tips to better explore the place? POLAROAD is here for you! With a team of people that were born in Siena and know every little corner of it, we are developing a wide range of POLATOURS, self-guided tours which will make you grasp the real essence of this middle-aged city. You will learn not only the historical details, but, most importantly, all the stories which have been passed down from generation to generation within Sienese families. These tours may also be enriched by the rental of instant cameras which will make your experience unique and unforgettable, leaving you the most precious souvenir, the POLAGUIDE. The guidebook, which guides you around in the city, will become an album where you can store all the memories of your trip! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In a world which goes super fast where digital technologies are present in almost all aspects of our life we want to take a step back and try to savor the real essence of things like photography and travelling.

<p>Escape with Jason Friend on an eloquent photographic journey that pays homage not only to the prehistoric remnants of a lost civilisation, but to the soul of a landscape immersed in mystery and wonder - a journey that aims to raise public awareness of these precious ancient monuments, and to assist in their preservation for future generations.</p>
<p>The Legacy project is the realisation of an idea that was inspired many years ago - it was Jason’s early visits to these sites that sparked his initial desire to learn photography.

This would take him on an incredible journey that would eventually lead to a career as a renowned professional landscape photographer.</p>

<p>Moving beyond a mere appreciation of the aesthetic, the aim of The Legacy Project is not simply to record the physical structure of these stone circles, but to instil a complete emotional experience which conveys the ethereal nature of these megalithic sites.

<p>In order to capture the stark and dramatic tone of these mystical landscapes, the project is being shot entirely in black and white using a mixture of infrared film, and infrared converted digital cameras.

<p>My name is Pablo Medina and I was born and raised in Mexico City. When I was 14 years old, I had the opportunity to immigrate to the United States, and have been living here ever since. I am now 24 years old and, although I am still legally viewed as a non-resident alien of this country, in many ways, I consider this place my home.</p>
<p>I have been fortunate to have experienced the egalitarian ideals of the American Dream - equal rights and opportunity for all – and have tried to make the most out of the invaluable opportunities I have been given through honest, hard work and dedication. While I believe that the American dream is still a reality, and that the United States remains the envy of the developed world, I have also witnessed the daily challenges that often come with being an underrepresented minority and an immigrant in this country.</p>
<p>With that in mind, and through The Melting Pot Series, I would like to shine a positive light on the beauty and power of this country’s diversity by featuring unsung heroes from underrepresented backgrounds and immigrant communities, who are breaking down barriers in the United States of America.</p>
<p>This summer I will be celebrating 10 years of my arrival to the U.S. and would like to do so by successfully launching this project!</p>
<p>As part of this campaign, and with your support, I would like to put together and distribute a photography book featuring some of these special people, as well as their stories, and, ultimately, organize an exhibit. By doing so,  I hope to raise awareness for important social issues such as immigration and the importance of diversity an inclusion.</p>

Create a scalable business from photography and my interest in tech and Freakonomics/Economics/Growth.
Documenting others in how they have created or are creating a business around their craft.
Creating this magazine is ten years in the making of wanting to document as honest and as raw as possible.
Wanting to show how many amazing people there are while grounding it into a strong visual document.
When you look at the magazine you see what inspires me, people, projects, events that either inspire or play a part of something further down the road.

(Images below from the magazine)





I am looking to reach a minimum of 30,000 euro. Costs include:
the magazine shall start on the Issuu platform.
Digital by the first and second edition, print-ready by the third edition (print versions of first and second edition shall be made available to a select amount of funders) and then as back order.
Equipment.
camera:
Lenses: 
Lights: 
Microsoft Surface laptop for heavy editing while on location.

You can help by Funding and/or sharing the campaign with your networks.







This shall start as a two-year project that puts true craft at the forefront that will both show how important craft, business, creativity, stubbornness, music, the spoken word, images, talking, listening, taking risks, asking others for advice, giving advice is to where we are at this moment. 
I chose to take this path, I chose to create something by seeing how many people I met within totally different projects had the same drive to create, grow, inspire, learn, change.
My want to push forward with this has allowed me to create something that does allow others to both sit back and take the time to read and learn from other people experiences.
making sure that offline reading was possible for people traveling.

<h2>Why is this project important ?</h2>
<p>The Republic of South Sudan is the youngest nation on earth and was founded in 2011, separated from what is now Sudan in the north. It is an Eastern-African, landlocked country of the size of France with approximately twelve million citizens consisting of more than 60 tribes. Shortly after it's foundation, in 2013, a civil war broke out, mainly between the two major tribes of the president and the vice-president. The country lacks almost every aspect of a functioning infrastructure: roads, electric grid, health care, education and modern communication. Many international aid organizations are present to overcome food shortages, health crises and help build basic infrastructure. The Northern Bar El Ghazal region has been so far, unlike other regions of South Sudan, spared from the <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/opinion/famine-stalks-south-sudan.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">atrocities of war, internal mass displacement and food shortages</a>. The pictures show the busy daily life, and the optimism of these pictures may enflame hope that this young country will able to stand up. With the support of this campaign, you will be able to obtain a fine reprint of the first edition, or a photo poster, or come to an exhibition, but most importantly, you will will help raise the awareness for a country which is one of the poorest country in the world and has the most challenges to overcome to change into a functioning society.</p>
<p>As of now, the production costs per book are approximately $120.- The higher the volume printed, the lower are the costs per book. The proceeds of the campaign will allow funding of the first edition of the book. It can then be distributed to galleries, book stores and other venues for sale to interested audiences at a significant lower sale price, and allow printing of additional editions.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenges of the project is to communicate to supporters how difficult it is to take pictures in this country,  to travel there, but also how important it is to raise awareness for countries which are not on our direct radar screen.  Right now, the US Department of State give a Level 4 travel advisory: Do not travel to South Sudan due to crime and armed conflict. Violent crime, such as carjackings, shootings, ambushes, assaults, robberies, and kidnappings is common throughout South Sudan, including the capitol, Juba. If one does an <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=south+sudan&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5-tvbyajcAhWudN8KHRisBlcQ_AUIDSgE&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1103"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">online search</a>, mostly pictures of refugees and soldiers can be found.

All of them in the nude or seminude. Would you also be photographed by a stranger?Now, after two years of intensive work, we are ready to publish Daily Portrait Berlin Book, featuring 381 unique portraits of naked Berliners in their homes.ABOUT THE BOOKToday's time-controlled by social networks defines who we are, how we should live and how we should feel. We are overwhelmed with the beauty ideal defined by advertising campaigns and films which are translated into capturing stylized selfies.With Daily Portrait Berlin, we want to show people in an authentic way, while at the same time encouraging real-life connections and interactions- away from social media and the digital world- and create a community where people in Berlin can meet without prejudice and fear and be who they are, without censorship and predefined attitudes.DP Berlin is a tool to get to know people, let go of their fears, challenge themselves, have a new life experience, and basically strip in front of a stranger.You can have fun discovering the stories of strangers you would have never met. You can examine the shelves in the kitchen. See what book the tattooed girl is reading. Be surprised by the huge piano in the apartment of an athlete. Laugh over humorous decorations. Notice the artistic compositions on the walls created by creative people feeling inspired.  It shows Berlin apartments that reflect the personality of their owners. It shows how people truly are-in the nude- in their true living space. It shows an array of emotions; happy, silly, shy, serious, concerned, uncertain and sometimes even a bit weird. BOOK DESIGNThe book, whose dominant color is yellow, brings 430 pages of photographs interspersed with quotations from the participants.  The portraits will be published in chronological order. Some portraits will be published on a single page, some other on a double page spread in order to properly show details. The book is a comprehensive form of visual storytelling an deliver an authentic mosaic of Berlin inhabitants.The Graphic Work of Marek Kučera sensitively working with all the photographs.Readers will also find the Photo manual.HOW IT WORKS?Daily Project Berlin is a participatory exploration of the identity of modern Berliners. The concept is simple: 1 camera and 381 Berliners. For example: Marie takes a photograph of John (naked) in his apartment. Marie gives John the camera and now John has to take a photo of Will (naked) in his apartment the next day. The photo shoot takes place at the model’s homes. The whole body has to be captured on the photo. Those who want can be naked, otherwise in underwear. And the stories goes until 381 photos are made.This concept proved to be a positive tool for social interaction and a great way for people to challenge themselves and breaks down barriers. It allowed people to become comfortable with themselves and with each other, and create a community.DP Berlin is a project that unites people regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, material wealth or racial or national affiliation.DP Berlin creates moments of unexpected encounters and stories that are captured in photographs, with many random encounters, moments of surprises and what happens when two strangers meet. Through this project, everyday people experience being a model and a photographer.Photos show the dialogue between the photographer and the model.

<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>I want to get into nature (way into nature) for great photography opportunities and to be inspired by the adventure:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a filmmaker and photographer currently living in the mountains of North Carolina. The love of sharing beautiful things with others is slowing taking over my life. </li>
<li>My campaign will bridge a gap that has appeared in my funding of this adventure.The photos that I will share and the emotion that comes with them will be the product of this endeavor. </li>
<li>What will be accomplished by throwing some dough into my campaign you ask. Well, it will make the adventure possible and with enough funding it will fund the gear to upgrade my equipment thereby increasing the quality of my photos. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is what I need:</p>
<ul>
<li>To eat while on the trail and stay at a hostel every so often to charge my batteries and scrub some of the stink off. If I raise enough I will be upgrading some of my photography gear.</li>
<li>What will you get. Unique works of art! I love taking photos that make me feel some thing. The photos I take will be made possible by you and I will be sharing them with you. There will be a book of my work from the trail with my best photos from my time in North Carolina. Check out the descriptions for the different levels to see what I am offering.</li>
<li>What will happen if I don't reach my goal? I'm going to go as far as I can with what I have and what you give. This is a dream and it value to me is immense. I've sold some of my prize possessions to make it happen so I am going no matter what. ""Do or do not there is no try"" Yoda</li>

<p>What are the risks of this undertaking? They are many. One in three that start the A.T. will finish it. injury is a very real possibility. Hiking 20 to 30 miles a day with 30 too 40 pounds on your back in rough and wild terrain can be hard on the body and doing it every day for 5 months can be hard on the mind. Being exposed to the weather and climbing into higher altitudes can also be a risk and a challenge. Ticks, snakes, mosquitos, poison ivy, and bears oh my.

Tal vez, se pregunta uno, si la cosa no era finalmente los españoles en el poder, sino el poder en manos de quién no sabe de necesidades, ni le importa solucionarlas si eso no lo beneficia en su gula.El relato particular del día a día de este viaje lo hicimos en redes sociales y ha sido compilado en un libro de viaje que hemos llamado ""Bicientenario: la libertad pendiente"".Este libro ha sido construido a través del registro fotográfico, junto con una crónica del viaje y de los análisis posteriores que nos suscitó éste con el fin de dejar memoria visual y etnográfica del color y las formas absurdas del paisaje, junto a la sonrisa y los pesares de toda la gente que nos acogió y se detuvo un rato para compartir con nosotros su pedazo de panela, una cerveza, una esquina, un poquito de su ser. La gente que existe más allá de los titulares y la fama. La gente real que construye cada día, contra todo pronóstico, un país posible.Es la impresión y difusión de este libro la que invitamos a apoyar a través de este crowdfunding. Les viajeresMaría Johana Cadavid MesaAntropóloga, pueblerina y feminista… Del mismo modo en el sentido contrario.

<h3>About the Author</h3>

<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution will help continue my exploration of Cuba, a country which I have had the pleasure of photographing in three separate journies over the past year and a half. Each visit has brought me so many touching and magical moments to photograph I feel compelled to continue to explore this wonderful island. Up to this point, I have self-financed the project but feel the need at this time to seek assistance in spending more time in the country. I am scheduled to travel in December to the far Eastern region of Cuba through the provinces of Holguín, Santiago de Cuba, and Guantánamo. Future travel will include other provinces as I plan to present the breadth of the country in pictures as comprehensively as I can.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As this trip will include travel over a much larger area of the country than I've tackled before, the expenses I will incur will be greater. Your contribution will help cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air and ground transportation to and around Cuba, lodging, and food for at my next two to three visits to the country over the next six months. </li>
<li>Printing of the initial 250 copies of the book.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Perks!!!</b></p>
<p>To show my thanks, we’ve created a variety of perk levels, including the photo book itself when published, high-quality prints of my your selection of many of the photographs in my portfolio, and credits in the book.</p>
<p>The most important perk is my gratitude for believing in my vision and my photography! I've worked countless hours making this project a reality to this point, with so many much more time and effort needed going forward it is great to know it is appreciated. Thanks!</p>
<p>And keep in mind even if the entire goal isn't met, I will continue to work on the project to its completion. It will just take much more time.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the relationship between the United States and Cuba in such flux, I feel it's more important than ever to provide a glimpse into, what is still largely a closed-off world, particularly to the people of the U.S. I also serve as an ambassador of sorts to the people of Cuba in that my photography seeks to tell their story and give some access to their world.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If you've visited Cuba you know it requires a fair amount of effort to uncover it's treasures. Trapped in time-warp, travel to Cuba necessitates at times, a great deal of patience and ingenuity.

</div><p> “ASPECTS OF BEAUTY” – a Nephilim MaxxPix photo series</p><p>The current culture surrounding the female form has becoming troubling. Mass marketing still pushes a very niche beauty reliant on heavy modification with makeup and Photoshop, to say nothing of the restrictive body type at the forefront. That is what this photo-series confronts.  </p><p>Simply put, this crowd-funding is to shoot a photo-series with the goal to showcase that every body type, from plus-size to petite, with a realistic light and minimal makeup, has the potential for beauty. In addition to using diverse models, the wardrobe will be acquired from chain retailers, such as Walmart or Kmart, to continue the more realistic approach. All of these elements will be brought together to demonstrate that women of any body type can be a practical model on a commercial level.</p><p>The crowdfunding is primarily to pay the locally-picked models, the wardrobe and studio space for the shoots. Additionally, a small percentage will go towards creation of the Nephilim MaxxPix website to host the galleries. </p><p>Q&amp;A</p><p>As this is a socially conscious project, I’ve taken the time to talk with different sources and here’s the most frequently asked questions that may cover some of your own:</p><p><b>What exactly is this? </b><br/>As stated, the baseline is a photo-series that will focus on showing that women of any type can be a model without needing to be Photoshopped or heavily made-up.</p><p><b>So like Victoria’s Secret model? </b><br/>No. While there’s a large market for women in revealing outfits and lingerie, this series is from a commercial modeling standpoint. That means that it’d be more akin to advertisement modeling with less attempt made for sex appeal.</p><p><b>Who are you? </b><br/>I am A.J. Carey, the event photographer for Nephilim MaxxPix. You can see my photography work on Facebook (XXXXXX), which is a selection of my personal and professional work.</p><p>Of course there’ll be more questions but I’ll answer them to the best of my ability when asked!</p><p>There are Stretch Goals that not only allow for additional photo-shoots, but an expansion of the premise to encompass male models as well.<br/><br/><b>$4,000</b> – In addition to the six photoshoots with six different models, reaching this Stretch Goal will allow for the six models to do each photoshoot (i.e. each model would do a photo-shoot in business attire, in casual, etc,).

Mass marketing still pushes a very niche beauty reliant on heavy modification with makeup and Photoshop, to say nothing of the restrictive body type at the forefront. That is what this photo-series confronts.  Simply put, this crowd-funding is to shoot a photo-series with the goal to showcase that every body type, from plus-size to petite, with a realistic light and minimal makeup, has the potential for beauty. In addition to using diverse models, the wardrobe will be acquired from chain retailers, such as Walmart or Kmart, to continue the more realistic approach. All of these elements will be brought together to demonstrate that women of any body type can be a practical model on a commercial level.The crowdfunding is primarily to pay the locally-picked models, the wardrobe and studio space for the shoots. Additionally, a small percentage will go towards creation of the Nephilim MaxxPix website to host the galleries. Q&AAs this is a socially conscious project, I’ve taken the time to talk with different sources and here’s the most frequently asked questions that may cover some of your own:What exactly is this? As stated, the baseline is a photo-series that will focus on showing that women of any type can be a model without needing to be Photoshopped or heavily made-up.So like Victoria’s Secret model? No. While there’s a large market for women in revealing outfits and lingerie, this series is from a commercial modeling standpoint. That means that it’d be more akin to advertisement modeling with less attempt made for sex appeal.Who are you? I am A.J. Carey, the event photographer for Nephilim MaxxPix. You can see my photography work on Facebook (XXXXXX), which is a selection of my personal and professional work.Of course there’ll be more questions but I’ll answer them to the best of my ability when asked!There are Stretch Goals that not only allow for additional photo-shoots, but an expansion of the premise to encompass male models as well.$4,000 – In addition to the six photoshoots with six different models, reaching this Stretch Goal will allow for the six models to do each photoshoot (i.e. each model would do a photo-shoot in business attire, in casual, etc,). This Stretch Goal brings a new dimension to the shoot, with a clear comparison between each body type and each clothing choice.$6,000 – This Stretch Goal allows me to do a parallel photo-series in the same vein yet with the clear distinction that it will be with male models. Just as with the previous Stretch Goal, this adds an extra layer to the whole premise, as well as bringing up another very limited view from the modeling community.$8,000 - If this goal is reached, in addition to all previous goals, there will be a special photo-series that mimics popular modern advertisements that have come out. $10,000 – This is basically my miracle Stretch Goal and it just means that I’ll be able to put a down payment on permanent studio space.

Hello everyone,
I'm a portrait photographer based in Milano, Italy. 
After some years working in ADV photography as a digital artist, I took a break from this job and started traveling mostly in South East Asia. There I found my true self as a portrait photographer. Taking pictures for me is a way to meet people around the world and discover their culture and traditions.
More about my photography here: 
https://www.facebook.com/annaruggieriphotographer/
http://www.annaruggieri.com



My project consist in 20/30 photos representing people of Myanmar: their life and their pure eyes. Myanmar is still a very ""closed"" country due to his political situation, but the people's eyes would communicate much more than what we expect.
With your help it would be possible to print my selected pictures to create an exhibition and share my experience with everybody by printing a photobook too.  

    What I Need & What You Get More details:  To print and put in frames my 20 (up to 30) 70cm x 50cm pictures I would need at least €600. To create a photobook I need at least €200 to build the printable file.
I'm excited to present you my unique perks: cards and photobooks!
 If I won't reach my entire goal, all the funds will be used to produce my photobook and cards and send it to backers, being proud of sharing my project with this small audience.    

    Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't contribute you'll be helpful:  Sharing my Indiegogo campaign on social networks!

From revolutionizing the way we vote, to chipping down male-dominated fields, to opening platforms for women creatives to thrive; the stories of these women stand on the peaks of extraordinary. And in learning and understanding more stories like theirs, we remember...sometimes the boldest stories go untold. Our 'Change Makers' project hopes to change that.</p><p> </p><p><strong>INSPIRATION AND HOW YOU CAN HELP!</strong></p><p>The inspiration for 'Change Makers' ignited after we experienced the Women's March on Washington. The DC March alone joined more than half a million women to fight for human rights and band against the 2016-2020 president elect; while across the globe in all seven continents, more than 3.3 million women marched. Being pieces in the monumental movement, we knew that within these history-making marches, there were historic and heroic stories to be told.</p><p> </p><p><strong>To tell 30 of our Change Makers stories and inspire more, our goal is to raise $15,000 to create a 'Change Makers' website and series of exhibitions, events and book to reach young men and women to show a new picture of leadership. With your help, change is ours.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>OUR TEAM:</strong></p><p>CHANGE MAKERS has been conceived by 3 women on the bus to the Women’s March in Washington D.C. Here is who they are:</p><p><strong>Mary Dove, Producer and Website Design</strong></p><p>Mary works as a community organizer and activist creating educational and community programs supporting women. Mary Dove founded Lean In NYC in 2012 following the publishing of Sheryl Sandberg's book “Lean In”. The group now has over 4600 members and has produced 30 speaker and educational events. </p><p><strong>Camile Sardina, Writer</strong></p><p>Camille is the Director of PR for Lean IN NYC and has contributed to many publications including Teen Vogue, Ladygunn and BUST. She will be interviewing all of the featured women.</p><p><strong>Jena Cumbo, Photographer</strong></p><p>Jena has contributed to Ladygunn, BUST, Village Voice, has an MFA in photography and a background of shooting portrait photo projects.</p><p> </p><p><strong>OUR CAMPAIGN</strong></p><p>We’ve covered all our own expenses including gas, tolls, and production cost, <strong><u>not to mention countless unpaid hours</u></strong>, many late nights and even more early mornings. It's been an amazing joy!</p><p>Now, to actually get the exhibitions series ready to share with young men and women, we need your help! The costs break down like this:</p><ul>

</ol><p>Thank you, thank you, thank you!</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3></div>","You're invited to be a part of producing CHANGE MAKERS EXHIBITION AND BOOK! Change Makers is a portrait and story project spotlighting women revolutionizing change.https://www.changemakersunite.org/ CHANGE MAKERS – IF YOU CAN SEE IT, YOU CAN BE IT!The purpose of 'Change Makers' is to spotlight the women leaders of today whose work is devoted to change. From revolutionizing the way we vote, to chipping down male-dominated fields, to opening platforms for women creatives to thrive; the stories of these women stand on the peaks of extraordinary. And in learning and understanding more stories like theirs, we remember...sometimes the boldest stories go untold. Our 'Change Makers' project hopes to change that. INSPIRATION AND HOW YOU CAN HELP!The inspiration for 'Change Makers' ignited after we experienced the Women's March on Washington. The DC March alone joined more than half a million women to fight for human rights and band against the 2016-2020 president elect; while across the globe in all seven continents, more than 3.3 million women marched. Being pieces in the monumental movement, we knew that within these history-making marches, there were historic and heroic stories to be told. To tell 30 of our Change Makers stories and inspire more, our goal is to raise $15,000 to create a 'Change Makers' website and series of exhibitions, events and book to reach young men and women to show a new picture of leadership. With your help, change is ours. OUR TEAM:CHANGE MAKERS has been conceived by 3 women on the bus to the Women’s March in Washington D.C. Here is who they are:Mary Dove, Producer and Website DesignMary works as a community organizer and activist creating educational and community programs supporting women. Mary Dove founded Lean In NYC in 2012 following the publishing of Sheryl Sandberg's book “Lean In”. The group now has over 4600 members and has produced 30 speaker and educational events. Camile Sardina, WriterCamille is the Director of PR for Lean IN NYC and has contributed to many publications including Teen Vogue, Ladygunn and BUST. She will be interviewing all of the featured women.Jena Cumbo, PhotographerJena has contributed to Ladygunn, BUST, Village Voice, has an MFA in photography and a background of shooting portrait photo projects. OUR CAMPAIGNWe’ve covered all our own expenses including gas, tolls, and production cost, not to mention countless unpaid hours, many late nights and even more early mornings. It's been an amazing joy!Now, to actually get the exhibitions series ready to share with young men and women, we need your help! The costs break down like this:
Archival Prints: $1500.00
Frames and Mounting: $3000.00
Website: $500.00

<h3>Matt Round Studios</h3>
<p>Matt has been working as a freelance photographer in the local area now for around 5 years full-time. In this time his business in the commercial sector has grown from strength to strength. He spends most of his time doing commercial photography - products, events, corporate headshots etc.</p>
<p>As much as he loves his work, Matt has been longing to grow the portraiture side of his business, and the lack of a studio space has been holding him back. SO, we have found the <strong>perfect location</strong> to open a studio, and we need support from you to raise a small injection of capital to get it going!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is what we need, and what you will get in return for helping us to get there:</p>

</li>
<li>We have some awesome perks that you will want to sign up for, including <strong>pet photo shoots</strong> at a <strong>bargain price</strong>!</li>
<li>Everyone who pledges will be included on a <strong>'wall of fame'</strong> on our website.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our full fundraising goal on this round of crowdfunding, all money will be set aside until we are able to fund the rest of the project ourselves, at which point we will still fulfil your original pledges.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This opportunity will have a huge impact on the business. It will enable us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a customer facing relationship with our clients, where you can pop in for a cup of tea and discuss your requirements.</li>
<li>Grow a reputation within the local area.</li>
<li>Grow Matt's product offering and enable him to become a specialist in the area of portraiture.</li>

<h3>Journey to the Louvre with Justin</h3>
<p>Early this year Justin got word that a jury of 12, unanimously chose his photographs to be part of the 157th Salon National des Beaux Arts Exhibit, at the Louvre in Paris!!!  He is one of a handful of artists in Canada, travelling to Paris in December, to represent! The honour is indescribable and chance for international exposure is unparalleled.  He HAS to go!!  </p>
<h3>Justin's story</h3>
<p>Raised in Rural Ontario, Justin first fell in love with beautiful landscapes, big open skies, colour rich sunsets and billowing clouds well before he ever picked up his first camera. Taking photographs to capture this serenity was only natural. For decades Justin’s obsession with taking photographs was a well guarded secret that very few knew.  Used to escape the daily grind and the chaos life would throw his way, photography was an outlet he used to strengthen his mental health and keep creativity in his life.</p>
<p>Justin never thought that his personal form of therapy would land him in Paris, showing off one of his pieces of photography in the most artistic, influential places in the world!  Being selected to be a delegate representing Canada was a dream come true!!  </p>
<h3><strong>#HamOntGoesToParis</strong></h3>
<p>This campaign allows you to invest in this journey through the many perks available.  Own a piece of his photography to hang on your walls and support a Hamilton Artist in becoming International!!  Your investment through this campaign will ensure Justin's photography is presented in its best possible light.  Justin is proud to ensure the photo is printed locally and framed right here in Hamilton.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your investment</h3>
<p>Our perks are designed so that you get the value of your contribution in art and experience. We are hoping to raise $9000 so Justin can Journey to Paris!  The following is a breakdown of how Justin will use your generous contributions;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Preparation of the Photo - </strong>Justin cannot just worry about his image, he must also assess how it will be printed.  What will the frame look like, will he need an anti reflective glass, does canvas make more sense?  This will be a process of trials and cost can accumulate quickly.  Justin will be supporting LOCAL crafts people to print and frame his pieces and together they will find the right formula to send to Paris.  The estimated budget, including trials $1500.</li>
<li>
<strong>Shipping and Insurance - </strong>It won't be until the above is determined that we can know for sure the costs associated with shipping and insuring the piece, but in speaking with previous delegates and some generalized research we anticipate $2000.</li>
<li>
<strong>Artists fees - </strong>Once you are chosen to be a part of the exhibition there are fees you need to submit that cover the handling of your art once handed over to SNBA.  They include things like security, lighting, hanging and insurance while there. These fees are already over $2000</li>
<li>
<strong>Promotional Material - </strong>having the opportunity to meet 10,000 people in four days, we want to make sure Justin has enough media to disperse so that he can be reached after the event.  We are working with LOCAL marketing geniuses at Unicorn Rebellion, to design a takeaway for people to remember and hold on to so they can contact Justin at a later date.  Budgeting $3000</li>
<li>
<strong>Additional Funds - </strong>additional funds will be used to finish a professional webpage (same LOCAL geniuses) so that Justin can represent his work to all the new connections he will be making while in Paris, with pride. If we are lucky enough to exceed our goal Justin will use the funds to enter other galleries to continue growing his passion for art.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Hey, we get it if you cannot support financially, but please do not think your contribution ends there! We are grateful for every social media share, every conversation you introduce us to someone new and every LIKE or virtual high five of support along the way!</p>

<h3>The Gift</h3>
<p>We have always had it in our hearts to be entrepreneurs and we are now stepping into that chapter of our lives. Being former Army Veterans we also know that none of us is as strong as all of us, which is why we are launching this campaign.</p>
<p>We wanted to do something that would not only impact us but something that would also impact our community in a positive way.  We believe we have found a way to do that!  We have been blessed and fortunate to acquire a photography studio which we are calling ""The Spot"". </p>
<p>It was our desire to have a location that not only serves the needs of our clients but also the needs of other photographers and their clients. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal in this startup is to outfit ""The Spot"" with the necessary equipment while remaining debt-free.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are needing to raise at least <strong>10,000 dollars</strong> which will go towards renovations and supplies such as:<ul><li>Flooring, Studio Lighting, Backdrops, Props etc.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Any donation amount is greatly appreciated and with any campaign, there are some special perks!<ul>

We have always had it in our hearts to be entrepreneurs and we are now stepping into that chapter of our lives. Being former Army Veterans we also know that none of us is as strong as all of us, which is why we are launching this campaign.
We wanted to do something that would not only impact us but something that would also impact our community in a positive way.  We believe we have found a way to do that!  We have been blessed and fortunate to acquire a photography studio which we are calling ""The Spot"". 
It was our desire to have a location that not only serves the needs of our clients but also the needs of other photographers and their clients. 

What We Need & What You Get
Our goal in this startup is to outfit ""The Spot"" with the necessary equipment while remaining debt-free.

We are needing to raise at least 10,000 dollars which will go towards renovations and supplies such as:Flooring, Studio Lighting, Backdrops, Props etc.

Any donation amount is greatly appreciated and with any campaign, there are some special perks!
Those who live locally in the Pacific Northwest and donate an amount of 250 dollars or more will receive:
2 Full 1-hour photo sessions (excluding wedding/events) complete with a stylist to style your session. This is redeemable for 5 years!


Those who live locally in the Pacific Northwest and donate an amount of 500 dollars or more will receive:
3 Full 1-hour photo sessions (excluding wedding/events) complete with a stylist to style your session. This is redeemable for 5 years!


Those who live in distance and donate an amount of 200 dollars or more will receive:A custom-made C-Sharp photo mailed to your home.

<h3>Hello! It's me again!</h3>
<p>Emilie here! EmyBPhoto is now a team composed of myself (Emilie Black) and Charlotte Cox, assistant extraordinaire. This year we started a bit earlier and have already gotten 3 fab shoots done with 9 more to come. You loved the calendar last year, you will adore it this year!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, we need to be able to pay for this calendar's production from photoshoots to printing. That is where you all come in! We need some help! We are producing this one out of pocket and the pocket need a bit of help.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us pay for everything from gas to get to the photoshoots to wardrobe to printing to promotion.</p>
<p>In exchange, you get a calendar (or more) shipped to you. If you're feeling adventurous and generous, you can also get your very own photoshoot!</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Currently, we are going to print no matter what, so your risk is simply a question of will you love what we do or not. Here we pride ourselves in always delivering a quality product no matter what. The challenge at the moment is paying for everything and getting everything done on time for the printer's deadline while working 2 jobs and maybe having a full night's sleep every few weeks.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share, share, share! Share us on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, tell your auntie, your cousin, your neighbor's wife's nephew's co-worker. Telling as many people as you can helps us greatly in getting the word out and getting more fans to get this lovely calendar.</p>
<p>Another way to help is to request that your local horror shop carry the calendar for the Holiday season (we will be ready on time for Halloween!).</p>
<p>Thank you! Merci! Danke! Gracias!</p>

<h3><strong>About our project</strong></h3>
<p>In 2015 we traveled from Casablanca to Chefchaouen with a group of teenagers documenting their love for spreading Calisthenics to their communities. We were so inspired by their passion and enthusiasm for this ancient art of bodyweight movement that we decided to work with them to produce the first photographic book ever to celebrate the power and beauty of Calisthenics, set against the mystical and vibrant backdrop of the blue city of Chefchaouen.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506632548/zr4lf7oofmctcp3ozbgs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>But this is more than a book,</strong> it’s part of a greater project to raise awareness, to show how Calisthenics is changing people’s lives and transforming communities.</p>
<p>Your contribution will not only help us bring this book to life but will also empower the next generation of young people - starting by creating employment for the youth featured in the book. An agenda that coincides with the United Nations vision of Sustainable Development.</p>
<p><strong>100% of sales profit</strong> will go to support ""Je Suis Calisthenics” - A non-profit cause that empowers communities through calisthenics.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Book</strong></h3>
<p>The book covers the tour of a group of teenagers over 6 weeks, from the outdoor parks of Casablanca towards the peaks of the Chefchaouen Mountain Range. Driven by their passion for Calisthenics, we join them on an uplifting tale of determination and solidarity, reminding us that life is a journey, not a destination. Full of rich and striking photography this book transcends the boundaries of culture and language.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506637145/rz4oneerzcf3jz1ebope.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The use of gritty black and white photography demonstrates the youth at play in their urban environments, juxtaposed with hyper-real coloured images of the youth, shot against the mystical blue and vibrant backdrop of Chefchaouen. This book shows the incredible dynamism of youth culture expressing itself in a new and exciting way putting the youth of Casablanca on a blue pedestal.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>""The first book to ever cover the culture of the community in calisthenics.""</strong></h3>

<h3><strong>Who are we?</strong></h3>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>We are the Kashmirwala brothers, a duo of creative visionaries.</span></p>
<p>Ibrahim, photographer and award-winning creative director with over ten years of experience in the field of visual effects and communication.</p>
<p>Fahd, social animator with a passion to develop communities through the encouragement of health and wellbeing - founder of ""Je Suis Calisthenics"".</p>
<p>Our ethos is to work with inspiring individuals and create projects that have a positive social impact. We believe that no dream is too big to achieve.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why Morocco?</strong></h3>
<p>On a photographic trip to Morocco in 2014, we came across a group of teenagers doing Calisthenics in a skateboard park in Casablanca. They welcomed us into their group and although we didn’t speak their language, <strong>we communicated through Calisthenics</strong>. They showed us their moves and we were blown away by their raw energy, their enthusiasm and their humbling spirit. These kids had almost nothing and they were sharing so much with us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506633917/kq2ghp1mbvjl4ygocka9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""> </p>
<p>Calisthenics is a new wave of freestyle athletic conditioning. This cutting-edge sports movement calls on bodyweight resistance, balance and core-strength, setting itself apart from the sleek, self-conscious, mirrored world of city gyms, and asserting itself firmly in the raw, dusty and gritty streets. Its essence as a culture is an adaptable, creative mentality that pushes one’s ability to the furthest limits. The driving ethos shared by this collaboration is determination, simplicity of vision and creativity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>""With Calisthenics, the entire world is your playground.""</strong></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506631797/ckhd8djdfqwrbnx1gbdg.jpg"" src=""""/>
</h3>
<p>Calisthenics is at a similar stage to where skateboarding was in the 70s. Like skateboarding, it was born in the streets. Groups of guys hanging out in deprived areas with no real vision of the future, working on their skills with passion and determination. Just as the kids of Dogtown would break into abandoned houses to use empty swimming pools to skate in, childrenss playgrounds are being used for Calisthenics. Teams organise group workouts. <strong>The older kids teach the younger ones</strong>.</p>
<p>But because of the general lack of awareness and support, these groups are often seen as anti-social.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506634216/cd7dxmcghgxz6uwovxbk.jpg"" src=""""/> That’s why we decided to create a photographic document of Calisthenics, <strong>to celebrate its power and beauty </strong>and show how it can build confidence and self-esteem and bring communities together. So, we took the group to Chefchaouen, the Blue City in the Rif Mountains – the perfect artistic backdrop to show off Calisthenics. </p>
<p>In Chefchaouen we felt we were present at the birth of a new global movement. And because it’s only a matter of time before this movement becomes an industry,<strong> it’s important that it stays in touch with its roots</strong>. The team spirit, mutual support and positive reinforcement that happen at the Calisthenics bar have the power to bring people together from all backgrounds, regardless of ethnicity, age or gender, contributing towards much-needed unity and social integration.</p>
<p>What started as a photographic project has evolved into “Je Suis Calisthenics” </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Cause - “Je Suis Calisthenics” </strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506636332/u4kqkub20p9f8avg3be4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">(<i>Photo not part of Journey to the Blue City</i>)</p>
<p>This project has been 3 years in the making because we wanted to create a photographic masterpiece whilst being socially responsible by finding a way to create sustainable and decent work for the youth. <strong>With this IndieGoGo campaign,</strong> we will be able to do just that.</p>
<p>Our aim is to produce and publish 500 copies of “Journey to the Blue City”. After distributing copies to all backers, the remaining<strong> </strong>copies will be sold and <strong>100% of sales profit will go to fund “Je Suis Calisthenics”</strong> - a non-profit cause that empowers communities by creating decent employment for the youth and encouraging their love and passion for Calisthenics. </p>
<p> </p>

<p style=""text-align: right;"">(<i>Photo not part of Journey to the Blue City</i>)</p>
<p><strong>But that's not all, </strong>the classes they provide to disadvantaged communities are free of charge. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The vision of “Je Suis Calisthenics” to encourage good health and wellbeing and provide full and productive employment is a vision that coincides with the United Nations Agenda of 2030 for creating sustainable development globally.</span></p>

</div></div>","About our project
In 2015 we traveled from Casablanca to Chefchaouen with a group of teenagers documenting their love for spreading Calisthenics to their communities. We were so inspired by their passion and enthusiasm for this ancient art of bodyweight movement that we decided to work with them to produce the first photographic book ever to celebrate the power and beauty of Calisthenics, set against the mystical and vibrant backdrop of the blue city of Chefchaouen.

But this is more than a book, it’s part of a greater project to raise awareness, to show how Calisthenics is changing people’s lives and transforming communities.
Your contribution will not only help us bring this book to life but will also empower the next generation of young people - starting by creating employment for the youth featured in the book. An agenda that coincides with the United Nations vision of Sustainable Development.
100% of sales profit will go to support ""Je Suis Calisthenics” - A non-profit cause that empowers communities through calisthenics.
 
The Book
The book covers the tour of a group of teenagers over 6 weeks, from the outdoor parks of Casablanca towards the peaks of the Chefchaouen Mountain Range. Driven by their passion for Calisthenics, we join them on an uplifting tale of determination and solidarity, reminding us that life is a journey, not a destination. Full of rich and striking photography this book transcends the boundaries of culture and language.

The use of gritty black and white photography demonstrates the youth at play in their urban environments, juxtaposed with hyper-real coloured images of the youth, shot against the mystical blue and vibrant backdrop of Chefchaouen. This book shows the incredible dynamism of youth culture expressing itself in a new and exciting way putting the youth of Casablanca on a blue pedestal.
 
""The first book to ever cover the culture of the community in calisthenics.""
 

Who are we?
We are the Kashmirwala brothers, a duo of creative visionaries.
Ibrahim, photographer and award-winning creative director with over ten years of experience in the field of visual effects and communication.
Fahd, social animator with a passion to develop communities through the encouragement of health and wellbeing - founder of ""Je Suis Calisthenics"".
Our ethos is to work with inspiring individuals and create projects that have a positive social impact. We believe that no dream is too big to achieve.
 
Why Morocco?
On a photographic trip to Morocco in 2014, we came across a group of teenagers doing Calisthenics in a skateboard park in Casablanca. They welcomed us into their group and although we didn’t speak their language, we communicated through Calisthenics. They showed us their moves and we were blown away by their raw energy, their enthusiasm and their humbling spirit. These kids had almost nothing and they were sharing so much with us.
 

 
Calisthenics is a new wave of freestyle athletic conditioning. This cutting-edge sports movement calls on bodyweight resistance, balance and core-strength, setting itself apart from the sleek, self-conscious, mirrored world of city gyms, and asserting itself firmly in the raw, dusty and gritty streets. Its essence as a culture is an adaptable, creative mentality that pushes one’s ability to the furthest limits. The driving ethos shared by this collaboration is determination, simplicity of vision and creativity.
 
""With Calisthenics, the entire world is your playground.""
 

Calisthenics is at a similar stage to where skateboarding was in the 70s. Like skateboarding, it was born in the streets. Groups of guys hanging out in deprived areas with no real vision of the future, working on their skills with passion and determination. Just as the kids of Dogtown would break into abandoned houses to use empty swimming pools to skate in, childrenss playgrounds are being used for Calisthenics. Teams organise group workouts. The older kids teach the younger ones.
But because of the general lack of awareness and support, these groups are often seen as anti-social.
 That’s why we decided to create a photographic document of Calisthenics, to celebrate its power and beauty and show how it can build confidence and self-esteem and bring communities together. So, we took the group to Chefchaouen, the Blue City in the Rif Mountains – the perfect artistic backdrop to show off Calisthenics. 
In Chefchaouen we felt we were present at the birth of a new global movement. And because it’s only a matter of time before this movement becomes an industry, it’s important that it stays in touch with its roots. The team spirit, mutual support and positive reinforcement that happen at the Calisthenics bar have the power to bring people together from all backgrounds, regardless of ethnicity, age or gender, contributing towards much-needed unity and social integration.
What started as a photographic project has evolved into “Je Suis Calisthenics” 
 
The Cause - “Je Suis Calisthenics” 

(Photo not part of Journey to the Blue City)
This project has been 3 years in the making because we wanted to create a photographic masterpiece whilst being socially responsible by finding a way to create sustainable and decent work for the youth. With this IndieGoGo campaign, we will be able to do just that.
Our aim is to produce and publish 500 copies of “Journey to the Blue City”. After distributing copies to all backers, the remaining copies will be sold and 100% of sales profit will go to fund “Je Suis Calisthenics” - a non-profit cause that empowers communities by creating decent employment for the youth and encouraging their love and passion for Calisthenics. 
 

(Photo not part of Journey to the Blue City)
But that's not all, the classes they provide to disadvantaged communities are free of charge. The vision of “Je Suis Calisthenics” to encourage good health and wellbeing and provide full and productive employment is a vision that coincides with the United Nations Agenda of 2030 for creating sustainable development globally.
By helping our project, together we can play a much bigger role, in creating a sustainable future for the world.
 
What We Need and What You Will Receive:

With your help, our goal is to have a limited print run of 500 books. If we do not reach our goal, we will still deliver a high-quality final product to our contributors. If we exceed our goal, we will be able to make more funds available to Je Suis Calisthenics.
By contributing to this project you will become one of the few owners of this inspiring limited edition book. But even more importantly you will become an active contributor to sustainable development In Morocco.  
We have contacted printers and received our quotes. Now, all we need is you!  - We are projecting that you as a backer can expect to receive Journey to the Blue City right in time for Christmas 2017.
All other perks, such as wristbands, postcards and prints are available now and are also expected to be delivered before Christmas 2017.
 Challenges and Moving Forward

We have put together a great team, and we've prepared as much as possible to make sure that this project runs smoothly. From this campaign, through the book design and production, to shipping out orders, we know what our next steps are and what deadlines we have to meet. 
The Calisthenics community is growing steadily year on end and it is only a matter of time before we look back to when it all began. We are certain this will not only bring a nostalgic value but an inspirational one, to how this sport can bring about a positive change. 
We do not have an advertising budget, but we believe this project is rich enough to sell itself via word of mouth. So please tell your friends to visit and share https://www.facebook.com/JourneyToTheBlueCity/

<p>MY STORY</p>
<p>My name is Giovanni di Mola. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I’m a photographer and DJ based in 
Upstate New York. 10</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> years ago I left a life in the clubworld of New 
York City to clean myself up and get some perspective on who I am, what I
 want, and the mark I want to make. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">That’s when
 I discovered the city of Hudson, New York, about 2 hours north of 
Manhattan.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433343341/k7ci3s1oho9jmuw3ufke.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Like me, Hudson had lived through its own colorful 
chapters – a thriving whaling town, a pipeline city for drugs and 
prostitution, and then, in its most recent incarnation, a safe harbor 
for creative people fashioning a life outside the mainstream.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433344309/ezyhrfmmx3iquqigcjhp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Like
 most typical New Yorkers, I didn't have a car or a driver's license, 
but Hudson was a walkable town, a Main Street town, not too big, not too
 small. And because the rents were exponentially cheaper than what I was
 paying in New York, I was able to open my photography studio and start 
my life as a professional artist.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433727885/cgrbalzetibkzrrpqq94.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Over the next
 ten years, I would come to know who I am through the people I 
photographed – people that were searching for themselves just like I 
was. That search for identity became the throughline of my work.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>The 
portraits were a conversation. For the subjects, they were seeing 
themselves through another’s eyes, gaining a fresh perspective, and 
being reminded of their unique beauty.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433343854/njmcazgxh9dyi5j5ljlg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For me, each portrait drew me 
deeper into an understanding of my own identity. I was unraveling the 
knot that had formed in my childhood and early adulthood in New York 
City and was finally seeing the threads of who I truly am for the first 
time.</p>
<p></p>

<p>I began to show my work at local 
galleries and shops and was astonished and humbled when the work began 
to find an audience. I won the Columbia County Artist Award for Best in 
Show and was selected as one of the first NYFA Mark artists exhibiting 
in Hudson and New York City – a rewarding homecoming of sorts. Since 
then I've shown in several galleries, have been published in Italian 
Vogue and Vice Magazine and have sold my work to patrons from around the
 world.</p>

MY STORY
My name is Giovanni di Mola. I’m a photographer and DJ based in 
Upstate New York. 10 years ago I left a life in the clubworld of New 
York City to clean myself up and get some perspective on who I am, what I
 want, and the mark I want to make. That’s when
 I discovered the city of Hudson, New York, about 2 hours north of 
Manhattan.



Like me, Hudson had lived through its own colorful 
chapters – a thriving whaling town, a pipeline city for drugs and 
prostitution, and then, in its most recent incarnation, a safe harbor 
for creative people fashioning a life outside the mainstream.


Like
 most typical New Yorkers, I didn't have a car or a driver's license, 
but Hudson was a walkable town, a Main Street town, not too big, not too
 small. And because the rents were exponentially cheaper than what I was
 paying in New York, I was able to open my photography studio and start 
my life as a professional artist.







Over the next
 ten years, I would come to know who I am through the people I 
photographed – people that were searching for themselves just like I 
was. That search for identity became the throughline of my work.



The 
portraits were a conversation. For the subjects, they were seeing 
themselves through another’s eyes, gaining a fresh perspective, and 
being reminded of their unique beauty.


For me, each portrait drew me 
deeper into an understanding of my own identity. I was unraveling the 
knot that had formed in my childhood and early adulthood in New York 
City and was finally seeing the threads of who I truly am for the first 
time.


I began to show my work at local 
galleries and shops and was astonished and humbled when the work began 
to find an audience. I won the Columbia County Artist Award for Best in 
Show and was selected as one of the first NYFA Mark artists exhibiting 
in Hudson and New York City – a rewarding homecoming of sorts. Since 
then I've shown in several galleries, have been published in Italian 
Vogue and Vice Magazine and have sold my work to patrons from around the
 world.



This book, and the show connected with it, will be a celebration of my journey as an artist, and the individuals I’ve had the pleasure of photographing along the way. It will also be the first official collection of my work as one complete story.

<h2><b>Short Summary</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p>Floods cause damage to towns, homes and businesses every year. Pensacola Florida had such a flood just one year ago. On April 29th 2014 my small  photography studio was flooded and I was not insured. FEMA would not help because my studio was NOT attached to my home so I did not meet the qualifications of a home based business. It was 50ft behind my home! I had to laugh to keep from crying. My photography career was wiped out over Night. </p><p>My Name is Frank Cotton and I have been a photographer for over 30 years, I began operating as a Professional Photographer / full time 16 years ago. When I was 49 years old I returned to college and finished a degree in photography. I love what I do, and its how I make a living to support my family.  I am seeking funding so I can replace my photo equipment  then I can at least work on location. Now at this point ! <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I truly hope you will try to understand what I am trying to accomplish.</span></p><p>The flood is the reason I lost everything and I need to replace the equipment of course. So what is the reason for needing to act so quickly right now ,well I have been given a tremendous photographic opportunity that could boost my career however I desperately need the right tools so that can  work (ie) the ""professional photo equipment"". On May 14th- 20th I will be attending The Annual IBMS competition for Photographers and Models..  All I have to do now is come up the photo equipment needed.  I will be show casing my photographic talents to over 20 Major Magazines . This opportunity will have a major impact on my career. I believe the old saying give a person a fish, feed them for a day, or give them a fishing pole and feed them for a lifetime. It maybe corny but the point is with the proper tools and enough ambition you can accomplish anything. In my case the proper tools are photo equipment. This is what I will be purchasing with the funds : A portable lighting system which includes x3 of the The Vagabond Lithium Extreme battery pack , x3 - Alien bees 800B flash heads, x3 - of the 18"" reflectors with triple layer diffusion sock, x3 - 3ft power cords , x1 - Nikon D 810 camera body w/accessories , x3 SD/flash cards , x1- Laptop computer for downloading and viewing photographs on location, x1- 1TB hard drive for storage, x1 Monfrotto camera backpack , x1 -Nikon/sigma 70-200mm lens. This is my dream to make it as a professional photographer on a national and International.

<p><span>Hello and welcome to University of Westminster fundraiser for the BA Photographic Arts Graduates for 2015. We consist of students from a diverse range of backgrounds from England, Germany, Italy, US and Poland. Photography is a medium that has permeated modern cultural thinking and has become the most democratic form of visual expression available to the public’s art and commercial consumption. The degree show held at the Old Truman Brewery on Brick Lane in June is your chance to experience some of the most varied, talented and eclectic young practitioners currently working today.</span></p>
<p>The degree show is our opportunity to share our work with you and the general public in a professional context  which represents not only our dedication to our craft and the invaluable experience of participating in the real world as photographic practitioners but also our desire to share the work with a wider audience. This project will challenge us to liaise with companies and to meet with new people.</p>
<p>As a team we will design, set up and curate the exhibition space. It is extremely important to make this show happen for all us, as its an exciting platform to show our work to a large audience and many great future opportunities are born out of exhibitions like these. As part of our fundraising efforts we are asking for pledges in order to fund one of the most exciting and ambitious degree shows to date. </p>
<p>The reason for this crowdsourcing  campaign  is to aid 40 students in raising £10,000 that will help us in the acquisition of the space, printing and framing to the highest professional standard, and the tools needed to prepare it for its purpose. Your generosity will allow us to spend more time focusing on creating a high standard of work and make the whole display much more achievable and above all a success! </p>
<p>The impact of your patronage will not only enable our 3 years of solid and consistent hard work to reach a platform for which it deserves, but will also allow you to participate and own prints and other rewards from some of the most talented young practitioners to date. By donating, or even sharing our pitch you will be helping to further the exposure of one of the most exciting end of year shows to date as well as helping to further the careers and exposure of a remarkably ambitious cohort of photographers. </p>
<p>If you are unable to donate please feel free to come along to the exhibition regardless and enjoy a varied collection of photographic imagery. </p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461265379/DSC01994_eudusj.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>Dr. Vince DeGennaro, Grace Tillyard and Gerty Surena have been working in Haiti together for three years. In addition to the treatment programme, we are currently working with our patients to educate and raise awareness about cancer in Haiti and elsewhere. Our goal is to promote a supportive community where women seeking cancer care is encouraged and accepted. But we still have a long way to go...<br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Cancer is currently killing more
people in the developing world than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria </span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">combined</i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">. Our
clinic in Port-au-Prince specialises in breast cancer care but also treats
other forms of adult cancer. Since we opened our doors in 2013, we have treated
over 400 patients in Haiti, over 300 with breast cancer. The programme is entirely
run by Haitian doctors and nurses. </span><br/></p>
<p><i>More than 80% of our patients are
poor and vulnerable women with advanced disease. </i>Often they do not have a job and have been abandoned
by their partners because of their illness. Many of the them are shunned by
their families or their communities. Poverty and fear of abandonment mean that
many women come to the clinic with advanced disease and some are immediately
placed into palliative care. One half of our patients are under fifty years old
and their illness hurts not just them but their young families, orphaning
children who may be abandoned or forced into domestic servitude. Treating
cancer in Haiti is not just clinically complicated, but is also woven into difficult
structural realities and lack of education and engagement with the services
provided.</p>
<p>Gerty Surena is a cancer survivor who
was fortunate enough to have received treatment in Haiti for her breast cancer
through the love and financial support of her friends and family more than a
decade ago. Now she heads the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/GSCCHAITI/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Haitian Support Group Against Cancer</a>, spreading
the message of awareness on television, the radio, and through communities. Her
organization helps poor women obtain the treatment that was previously
unavailable. This year, the Haitian Support Group Against Cancer and IHI have
started to involve more patients and family members in this mission and have
worked with them to tell stories and experiences to promote understanding and
awareness about the disease. </p>

<h3>We Need Your Help to Tell their Stories</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Through our work we have a glimpse of
the extreme bravery and suffering of the women we treat. Their stories are
powerful, heart breaking and push the boundaries of the humanly possible.
Together, we watch how women fight for their lives, their children's education
and a dignified position in society against the most incredible
odds. </p>
<p>Last year, we teamed up with Greek
photographer Nerris Markogiannis in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. He photographed
women receiving cancer treatment and recorded their stories. Over the course of
a few months, Nerris shot 15 women in the clinic and we asked them to tell
their stories through their own photographs and their bodies. </p>
<p>The photos in the book tell the story
of women living with breast cancer in Haiti, the good and the bad. The images
are raw and honest, displaying the scars that the women carry. Since our
patients come in with advanced disease, the photos are powerful reminders of
our frailty but also of the ability of the human spirit to persevere. We
recorded their thoughts on the pictures and living with breast cancer as a
woman in Haiti, written down in both English and Haitian Creole.</p>
<p><b>Our Haitian partners and patients
believe that these images will inspire more women to seek care for cancer at
earlier stages, saving lives.</b></p>
<p>We need your help so that these women
can share their stories with the world and shine a light on the devastating
effects of cancer on people living in developing countries. </p>
<p>The money raised from you through
Indiegogo would help us finalise, format and print 600 copies of this photo
book that we would distribute throughout Haiti in order to raise awareness
about breast cancer and encourage women into treatment earlier. We would also share
the final work with key international organisations and stakeholders working in
global health. With your help and through the stories of these women, we can
lobby for cancer care to be resourced adequately so that women don't have to
die from an entirely treatable disease. </p>

<h3>What Our Patients will Give You in Return for Your Support...</h3>
<div></div>
<p>We need $5500 to cover for cost of finalising, formatting and
printing the photo book. Here is a more specific break down:</p>
<p>- $1000 for formatting and desktop publishing courtesy of our
friend and fabulous photographer Nadia Todres!</p>
<p>- $4500 for printing 600 copies of the book locally. We will
have these printed and bound in Haiti so that the money will benefit Haitian
small business.</p>
<p>We asked our patients what perks they would like to give our
supporters. They came up with this:</p>
<p>- For $35, you get a copy of the book, and we'll give a copy of
the book to local clinics and grassroots organizations in Haiti to raise
awareness.</p>
<p>-For $60, you get a copy of the book, a bracelet supporting the
treatment program, and we distribute TWO copies through local clinics and
grassroots organizations in Haiti to raise awareness.</p>
<p>-For $100, your name will be printed in the book as a sponsor!
You'll also get a copy of the book, a bracelet supporting the treatment

giving them a way to make their stories heard and be advocates for cancer care
in their country. No one knows better then them the trials that face women with
cancer all around the world. </p>
<p>If you choose to support us, we will

deserves the opportunity to fight cancer through proper treatment. We also know
that in order for this to become a reality, we need to create empathy and
understanding between policy makers, international funding bodies and patients.
We also need to spread awareness in Haiti of breast cancer, it's symptoms and
treatments. We hope that you will help get this ball rolling by supporting this

</div></div>","Hello, from Haiti... We are an international team--an American doctor, an English communication designer, a Greek photographer, an American photographer, and a Haitian breast cancer survivor and advocate -- who all give support to a cancer screening and treatment programme in Port-au-Prince, Haiti through the non-profit Innovating Health International. 


Dr. Vince DeGennaro, Grace Tillyard and Gerty Surena have been working in Haiti together for three years. In addition to the treatment programme, we are currently working with our patients to educate and raise awareness about cancer in Haiti and elsewhere. Our goal is to promote a supportive community where women seeking cancer care is encouraged and accepted. But we still have a long way to go...
Cancer is currently killing more
people in the developing world than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined. Our
clinic in Port-au-Prince specialises in breast cancer care but also treats
other forms of adult cancer. Since we opened our doors in 2013, we have treated
over 400 patients in Haiti, over 300 with breast cancer. The programme is entirely
run by Haitian doctors and nurses. 
More than 80% of our patients are
poor and vulnerable women with advanced disease. Often they do not have a job and have been abandoned
by their partners because of their illness. Many of the them are shunned by
their families or their communities. Poverty and fear of abandonment mean that
many women come to the clinic with advanced disease and some are immediately
placed into palliative care. One half of our patients are under fifty years old
and their illness hurts not just them but their young families, orphaning
children who may be abandoned or forced into domestic servitude. Treating
cancer in Haiti is not just clinically complicated, but is also woven into difficult
structural realities and lack of education and engagement with the services
provided.
Gerty Surena is a cancer survivor who
was fortunate enough to have received treatment in Haiti for her breast cancer
through the love and financial support of her friends and family more than a
decade ago. Now she heads the Haitian Support Group Against Cancer, spreading
the message of awareness on television, the radio, and through communities. Her
organization helps poor women obtain the treatment that was previously
unavailable. This year, the Haitian Support Group Against Cancer and IHI have
started to involve more patients and family members in this mission and have
worked with them to tell stories and experiences to promote understanding and
awareness about the disease.

<p>Sighted Blessings is a gallery of God's creations and blessings. I started SB to show my appreciation for the beauty in not only the gift of photography that has been given to me, but also what has been given to all of us in our surroundings. I encourage others to appreciate the same, which is why I do what I do; I want to bless others with SB.</p>
<p>Sighted Blessings began as a budding hobby in the Spring of 2012, when a long-distance friend of mine fell ill. With no way to offer my presence in the time of need, I tried to think of another way to be of comfort. Since flowers were blooming on the trees, and I was fully equipped with a cell phone camera, I decided to take a picture of the budding flowers and send them to my ill friend. That first picture was the beginning of a journey. Soon after, I started a Facebook photo album, entitled ""Beauty In Nature"", that was a big hit among my Facebook friends. Three years and a professional camera later, Beauty in Nature remained a hit. Since then I have taken countless photos and done multiple photoshoots for friends and acquaintances. I do my work for free (though some insist that they pay!). Sighted Blessings, started in 2015, came out of a desire to want to bless even more people in the same way.<br/></p>

<p>Who are we? Ein Armor is a team, the heart and soul of which are a husband and a wife keen on travelling, photography and expressing themselves, their emotions and feelings through their photographs. Our aim is to show the people how we see the world. The task is to remind the people that the world is our home and that we ought to love it, know it, and to protect it.</p>
<p>We are especially thankful to our fate, which has brought us to the Canary Islands and to Tenerife. Throughout our lives, we have seen many locations both beautiful and interesting. However, Tenerife has swayed our hearts with how much is packed into this small corner of the earth, which is eternally showered by the vast waters. It is a unique place—a place so beautiful, nobody could possibly doubt it and the subtle desire to return here again and again. It has taken over a sizeable part of our hearts and we would like to share it. This book is a part of Tenerife, a part of us, and we sincerely hope that it will become a part of you. We are certain that this book will touch your heart, will fill it with pleasant memories and sentiments, and perhaps will surprise your with some unseen sighs. We are greatly honoured to have had a chance to compose this book. It is a book that serves as the business card of Tenerife.</p>

<li>help you explore 'What's Under a Woman's Skirt' (that's my favorite, can't get enough);</li>

<li>help us improve the quality of our work by upgrading the equipment and expanding our team;</li>

Here are the risks that we think of:</p><ul>
<li>COLOURS. The colour reproduction in printing is always a big challenge. Although we do our best to make the perfect prints, the actual prints<strong> </strong><u><strong>might not</strong> have the same colour shades</u> that you see on your screen;<br/> </li>
<li>PRODUCTION DELAYS. Depending on the printing facility's workload, the printing may get delayed by several days or a week. We will keep you informed about any changes of our schedule;<br/> </li>
<li>DELIVERY DELAYS. It happens that parcels get lost or severely delayed. To solve that we will have a tracking umber for your order. And if you don't get your order and the tracking information confirms that, we will do a full refund (minus Indiegogo fees).</li>
</ul><p> </p><div>
<h3 style=""font-family: Georgia, Bodoni, serif;font-weight: normal;color: #000099;"">If we don't hit the funding the target, no worries:)</h3>
<p>The goal is challenging indeed, and even if we don't hit the target you will anyways get your copy of the BOOK!</p>

Is it normal that I enjoy seeing women wearing pantyhose?
Why do pantyhose make women’s legs look so great?
Should I blame myself for wanting to peek under a pretty lady's skirt while she's in pantyhose?
And finally…WHY SO MANY WOMEN AVIOD WEARING PANTYHOSE?
 These are questions I've asked myself thousands of times, and I believe many men ask themselves these same questions.I'm Anatoly, a photographer who believes that women wearing pantyhose is the most beautiful sight in life.For more than 15 years I've been researching this alluring riddle, testing hundreds of pairs of pantyhose, learning the hosiery industry on all continents. Completed hundreds of interviews with women of different cultures and ages learning their attitude and wishes towards nylons. In 2008 my passion evolved and I started making photographs of women in pantyhose.I'm sharing them with the world  at pro-kolgotki.com.I've cataloged over 17,000 photographs and continue my research.Today I'm discovering answers to these questions, and the most important answer is within the photographs. High Quality Prints - for Timeless Value.From the today's ""single-use-joy"" to Timeless Value.Simulated image. The Book prototype in production.How often do you look at the photos you've taken  5 years ago?​I'd say 'never'. Sorry, but it's true.In digital form photographs are easily forgotten. We save photos in numerous digital storage locations never to be seen again.On paper these photographs will last. You can enjoy them anytime. Just pick up the book from your bookshelf and recall the emotions. Real Women, Not Models.The women in these photographs are EXCLUSIVE to our project. They're real girls from real life, not professionals.You won't find their faces on the covers of fashion magazines.These women are accountants, office managers, sales associates that I had a chance to meet in my life.The concept is to explore real women. See how they treat pantyhose on their legs. Study what they think of their own femininity and how their perception changes during a photography session. If you’d ask me “What are you doing under a woman’s skirt?”I’d answer “this is my Temple, I live here”.Anatoly Borodin, photographer.
 

""I must tell you that I think your photography is excellent, and the the models are beautiful, their poses, and the pantyhose are so very sexy! You do a great job! Long may you continue."" North-Yorkshire, UK

This campaign is important to us because it will:
give you a chance to explore the new angle of seeing femininity and pantyhose;
help you explore 'What's Under a Woman's Skirt' (that's my favorite, can't get enough);
get you a timeless piece of a unique photographic research. For life;
help us improve the quality of our work by upgrading the equipment and expanding our team;
Your support will bring us one step closer to our Big Dream: to inspire women to wear pantyhose in everyday life that will make this world a more exciting place to live. RISKS & CHALLENGESEvery project has it's difficult parts. Here are the risks that we think of:
COLOURS. The colour reproduction in printing is always a big challenge. Although we do our best to make the perfect prints, the actual prints might not have the same colour shades that you see on your screen; 
PRODUCTION DELAYS. Depending on the printing facility's workload, the printing may get delayed by several days or a week. We will keep you informed about any changes of our schedule; 
DELIVERY DELAYS. It happens that parcels get lost or severely delayed. To solve that we will have a tracking umber for your order. And if you don't get your order and the tracking information confirms that, we will do a full refund (minus Indiegogo fees).
 
If we don't hit the funding the target, no worries:)
The goal is challenging indeed, and even if we don't hit the target you will anyways get your copy of the BOOK!
