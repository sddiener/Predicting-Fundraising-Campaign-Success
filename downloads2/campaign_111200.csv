<strong>---</strong><br/><br/>Estratti Dal libro:<br/> </h2><h3><strong>COSA POSSO FARE PER SERVIRE IL CERCHIO?</strong></h3><p>La facilitazione è una forma d’arte orientata al servizio.</p><p>“Cosa posso fare per servire questo cerchio in questo momento?” è un mantra che ti può aiutare a mantenere i tuoi intenti nella giusta direzione, mentre ti trovi ad avere a che fare con tutti gli elementi che ti circondano in un evento ritmico.</p><p>La facilitazione del drum circle è un atto di servizio verso i partecipanti all’evento, piuttosto che una performance d’arte.</p><p>La vera intenzione di un facilitatore di drum circle è quella di guidare i partecipanti a suonare al più alto livello delle loro abilità, piuttosto che offrire una grande performance di facilitazione.</p><p>Anche se la facilitazione è basata su fondamentali principi di leadership, il tuo miglior intento è quello di portare il gruppo dove questo vuole andare, anche se dove loro vogliono andare è diverso da dove pensavi che li avresti portati.</p><p>Vuoi ascoltare e seguire le persone che stai guidando. Idealmente userai il tuo radar per ricevere le informazioni di cui hai bisogno per prendere la giusta decisione nel momento giusto.</p><p>Per attivare e mantenere attivo questo tipo di radar ti suggerisco di mantenere continuamente la seguente domanda come un mantra nella tua mente, mentre stai facilitando:</p><p>“Cosa posso fare per servire questo cerchio in questo momento?”</p><p>La maggior parte delle informazioni di cui hai bisogno per facilitare con successo il tuo cerchio è presente nella musica e nel ritmo creati dai partecipanti. Con un mantra di servizio nella tua testa e nel tuo cuore, puoi rimanere aperto a tutto il potenziale musicale presente nel gruppo. Questo ti offrirà molte possibilità di facilitazione, in ogni cangiante momento musicale.</p><p>Usare un mantra di servizio può esserti d’aiuto in tanti modi, mentre faciliti.</p><p>Molte volte mentre sono fuori dal cerchio ed aspetto che si sviluppi un punto di transizione, ho una brillante idea di facilitazione. Ho scoperto che più è brillante la mia idea, più sto ascoltando la mia idea invece che i partecipanti. Più sono distratto dalla mia idea, più grande è il casino che faccio con la musica del gruppo quando entro nel cerchio per facilitare quell’idea.</p><p>Se invece nella mia testa e nel mio cuore c’è un mantra di servizio proprio mentre porto questa idea nel cerchio, allora è più facile che io inserisca la mia idea in una prospettiva appropriata in relazione ai miei intenti di facilitazione. Quando dunque ascolto la musica che arriva dai suonatori nel cerchio, sono ispirato a facilitare una sequenza che abbia che fare con quel momento.</p><p>Qualche volta quando raggiungo il centro del cerchio mi accorgo che la mia brillante idea non è poi la cosa giusta da fare in quel momento. Ascoltando il mantra più che la mia idea, posso evitare di creare per me stesso un’esperienza di apprendimento del facilitatore, che però interrompa il flusso ritmico del gruppo invece che migliorarlo.</p><p>Il mantra “Cosa posso fare per servire questo cerchio in questo momento” è specialmente utile quando ti trovi fuori dal cerchio.</p><p>Ascoltare l’""uno"" del gruppo dall’esterno del tuo cerchio è pericoloso. Qualche volta il vero uno non è un numero, ma é in realtà l’inizio di un ciclo ritmico o musicale. Quindi vuoi ascoltare dov’è l’uno a partire dal centro del cerchio. Quando infatti sei fuori dal Drum Circle, non importa dove tu sia in piedi, udrai i suonatori vicini vicino a te molto di più che le altre sezioni della tua drum-circle-orchestra. Ciò che tu odi è una versione distorta della canzone di percussioni che sta venendo creata. Potresti sentire l’inizio del ciclo di una particolare sezione musicale, ma non nel contesto dell’intero gruppo.</p><p>Per ascoltare il vero ""uno"" del drum circle hai bisogno di ascoltare il gruppo dal centro del cerchio. Più grande il cerchio, più lontano ti trovi dal punto di orchestrazione e quindi la tua sensibilità di dove sia l’uno del gruppo risulterà più distorta.</p><p>Ecco perché negli eventi di drum circle più grandi prenoto una sedia nel cerchio centrale, come mio luogo dove stare quando ""mi tolgo dai piedi"".</p><p>Molti facilitatori, incluso me, qualche volta sentono da fuori dal cerchio quello che pensano essere l’uno.</p><p>Poi, senza ascoltare il gruppo, portano quell’uno percepito dentro il punto di orchestrazione e fanno ad esempio un segnale di stop sul secondo, terzo o quarto movimento reale dei partecipanti. Questo crea uno stop ritmico molto caotico, perché molti dei partecipanti sono ancora a metà del suonare un ciclo ritmico.</p><p>Questa situazione, mentre entri nel centro del cerchio a facilitare, può essere evitata facilmente ricordando il mantra di servizio.</p><p>Questa prospettiva ti mette nell’adesso del momento musicale, cancella qualsiasi conteggio tu stessi udendo fuori dal cerchio, e ti permette di udire e sentire la linea melodica ed il ciclo ritmico di tutto il gruppo.</p><p>Il mantra di servizio, quando usato costantemente nella tua facilitazione, crea una completa gestalt che si manifesta nella tua psicologia e nella tua fisiologia. Ti aiuta a mettere la tua missione in azione.</p><p>“Cosa posso fare per servire questo cerchio?” diventa un’attitudine che emana da dentro il tuo centro e si irradia in ogni azione tu compia.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607903162/lzv8e3eoqwv4pjz9muas.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><strong>CREA PICCOLI SUCCESSI</strong></h3><p>Creare piccole esperienze ritmiche di successo nei partecipanti al tuo cerchio è un potente modo di educare il tuo gruppo e di migliorare l’autostima individuale.</p><p>Piccoli successi ispirano anche una più forte consapevolezza di gruppo.</p><p>Puoi facilitare una combinazione di questi piccoli successi così da guidare il gruppo verso una maturazione come ensemble di percussioni.</p><p>La collaborazione implica che i partecipanti nel gruppo sono dipendenti gli uni dagli altri, nel riuscire a completare un compito.</p><p>Puoi facilitare brevi sequenze di eventi collaborativi che producano cambiamenti positivi e di successo nella musica di tutto il gruppo.</p><p>Creando piccoli successi nell’esperienza musicale del gruppo faciliti i seguenti aspetti del gruppo:</p><p>• Transizioni musicali esperienziali che insegnino ai partecipanti specifici aspetti dell’autofacilitazione, delle dinamiche musicali e del suonare in un ensemble di percussioni.</p><p>• Un ambiente di apprendimento positivo in cui i partecipanti siano raramente spinti in modalità di crisi dello studente.</p><p>• Un miglioramento nell’abilità del gruppo di ascoltarsi a vicenda e di suonare insieme.</p><p>• Un livello più alto di confidenza ed autostima sia personale che di gruppo.</p><p>Questi piccoli successi ti aiutano anche ad evitare l’eccesso di facilitazione (over-facilitation), diminuendo la possibilità di sviluppare il burnout da facilitatore, sia per i partecipanti che per te.</p><p>L’accessibilità è la chiave per facilitare esperienze di gruppo di successo, al loro massimo potenziale. Creando semplici sfide ritmiche per il tuo cerchio generi piccoli successi musicali. In questo processo costruisci anche le fondamenta di apprendimento di gruppo che incoraggiano successivi più grandi successi a livello ritmico.</p><p>Rendere un evento ritmico accessibile ai principianti, mentre intanto valorizzi suonatori intermedi ed avanzati in modo che possano esprimere se stessi, è una sfida.</p><p>Per affrontare questa sfida puoi facilitare piccole proposte progressive durante tutto l’evento, che permettano ai suonatori intermedi ed avanzati di esprimersi creativamente mentre i principianti imparano a padroneggiare i compiti di base.</p><p>Rendi ogni passo una piccola esperienza di apprendimento evolutivo per il tuo gruppo. In questo modo ogni esperienza che faciliti diventa una piattaforma per il prossimo passo verso la tua meta principale, cioè suonare con un’orchestra di percussioni in grado di autofacilitarsi.</p><p>Ciò che è buono per il cerchio è buono per il facilitatore. Creare piccoli successi può creare situazioni positive di apprendimento personale per te come facilitatore, migliorare la tua autostima e raffinare le tue competenze, i tuoi strumenti ed il tuo radar.</p><p>Per evitare di “addentare un boccone più grande di quello che tu possa masticare”, usa brevi sequenze di proposte accessibili. Lascia un tempo sufficiente perché il ritmo venga suonato fra una proposta e la successiva, in modo tale da dare sia ai suonatori che a te stesso tutto il tempo per respirare nel groove.</p><p>Nel frattempo gioca al limite della tua esperienza ed abilità di facilitazione, così da poter provare nuove idee, prenderti delle opportunità e creare delle sfide di apprendimento per te stesso. Questo implica che tu non ti limiti a facilitare nella sicurezza tecnica della tua area di comfort. Facendo questo limiteresti la tua opportunità di crescere e maturare come facilitatore, mandando intanto il tuo cerchio a dormire.</p><p>In ogni caso, se sei un facilitatore alle prime armi, ti consiglio di sperimentare ed improvvisare soltanto uno strumento, tecnica o elemento di facilitazione alla volta. Poi, alla fine di ogni sequenza facilitata, sarà semplice per te renderti conto quale parte della tua facilitazione abbia funzionato e quale parte possa necessitare di elaborazione.</p><p>Suggerimento: KISS - Mantienilo stupidamente semplice (Keep it stupidly simple).</p><p>Se mentre faciliti tieni nel tuo cuore il concetto di creare piccoli successi, puoi evitare molti degli effetti collaterali negativi che accadono quando il cerchio viene costretto a fare dei passi più grandi di quelli che è pronto a fare. Alcuni di questi effetti negativi sono “modalità di crisi dello studente”, transizioni musicali fallimentari e burnout del facilitatore.</p><p>Lascia che gli obiettivi per l’evento ti guidino mentre faciliti ogni proposta via via verso il raggiungimento del risultato desiderato. Mantenere questi obiettivi ti aiuterà a rimanere focalizzato sul processo che si manifesta di fronte a te. Fai un piccolo passo di facilitazione alla volta, per raggiungere le mete del gruppo mentre intanto crei un programma di successo.</p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607903138/ssi7mdstoglcbegpfdyc.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><h3><strong>LA PUNTA DELL'ICEBERG</strong></h3><p>Quando vedi un iceberg che fluttua nell’oceano in realtà stai vedendo meno di un quarto della sua massa. Oltre il 75% dell’iceberg è sommerso: un’ invisibile piattaforma che supporta la punta visibile al di sopra della linea dell’acqua.</p><p>Strumenti e tecniche sono le parti visibili degli elementi che formano la ""Triplicità della Facilitazione Arthuriana"" (assieme all'intento, ndr).</p><p>Insieme formano la punta dell’iceberg. Gli strumenti sono facili da imitare ed imparare, basta guardare altre persone che facilitano. Anche la maggior parte delle tecniche di facilitazione sono visibili, ma l'intento dietro di esse é qualche volta non visto.</p><p>Il tuo intento, reso forte dalla tua mission e dalle filosofie che la supportano, è il motore che guida gli strumenti e le tecniche.</p><p>Mentre faciliti un evento di Drum Circle coesivo e congruente, sono i tuoi intenti a muovere i tuoi strumenti e le tue tecniche. Sono la tua filosofia e quindi anche la tua missione ed i tuoi intenti a formare la piattaforma invisibile che tiene in piedi strumenti e tecniche.</p><p>Non importa quanto bravo tu sia nell’usare strumenti e tecniche di base, dovrai avere anche una chiara intenzione, in modo da evitare di creare un Drum Circle vuoto, senza direzione e che magari non è neanche divertente.</p><p>Senza una filosofia ben sviluppata del perché tu stia in mezzo ad un cerchio di suonatori mentre li dirigi, la tua facilitazione mancherà di sostanza. Senza un intento ben sviluppato, pure la punta del tuo iceberg potrebbe essere non ben visibile.</p><p>Mentre avere un’esperienza come percussionista professionista, performer o insegnante di percussioni può darti un vantaggio come facilitatore di Drum Circle, invece possedere soltanto quel background e gli strumenti e le tecniche di facilitazione non è sufficiente per renderti un buon facilitatore.</p><p>La tua capacità di intrattenere, la tua capacità di suonare e le competenze di linguaggio corporeo sono semplicemente degli strumenti.</p><p>Per essere un facilitatore di successo hai bisogno di ascoltare il gruppo in modo da sapere quando, come e perché usare questi strumenti.</p><p>Facilitare con una piena attenzione verso il tuo cerchio deriva dall’ intento di servire il gruppo.</p><p>Questo intento supporta e dirige l’uso degli strumenti di facilitazione.</p><p>Quando comprendi I tuoi intenti, l’esperienza del passato non influenzerà inconsciamente le tue azioni verso una manipolazione che possa ostacolare un’esperienza di successo.<br/><br/> </p><h3><i><strong>Segui il Gruppo che Ti Sta Seguendo</strong></i></h3><p>""La nostra sfida come ""evangelisti ritmici"" è quella di seguire i partecipanti che pensano di stare seguendoci, ed usare l’energia e lo spirito che ci danno. Quando lo facciamo ci conduciamo a vicenda sul giusto sentiero che porta a fare musica veramente magica. Questo é accaduto a me e Christine Stevens alla prima conferenza internazionale di musicoterapia (in USA, ndr.).</p><p>    Christine Stevens è una musicoterapeuta che facilita regolarmente drum circle alle conferenze di musicoterapia, che sono tradizionalmente sponsorizzate da REMO.<br/>Io e lei abbiamo una relazione di facilitazione in continua evoluzione che ha iniziato a svilupparsi fin da quando partecipò al mio primo grande training per facilitatori alla conferenza di musicoterapia a San Louis, Missouri, nel 1992.</p><p>Lei era una dei 200 partecipanti a quel corso e non la incontrai personalmente se non alcuni anni dopo ad un drum circle facilitato sopratutto da uomini, alla Convention della Percussion Arts Society (PASIC).</p><p>Tutti i facilitatori fecero a turno per saltare nel cerchio a mostrare i loro talenti. Fui sorpreso nel vedere questa donna folletto altamente carismatica facilitare una sequenza dinamica nel drum circle tanto bene ed anzi meglio delle sue controparti maschili. A quel tempo avevo una relazione personale con praticamente tutti i Community Drum Circle Facilitator della nostra piccola ma crescente comunità, ma non avevo mai visto o sentito dire di Christine prima di quel momento. Dopo che lei  ebbe concluso il proprio turno nel facilitare il drum circle al PASIC, camminai verso di lei e le chiesi “Dove hai imparato a facilitare così?” La sua semplice risposta fu “Da te”.</p><p>Ad ogni seguente conferenza di musicoterapia, quando facilitavo drum circle o cerchi ritmici, invitavo Christine a saltare dentro e facilitare una sequenza. Ad un certo punto giunse il tempo per noi di cofacilitare veramente ad una intera conferenza di musicoterapia come partner alla pari. Questo accade alla prima conferenza internazionale di musicoterapia mai tenutasi.</p><p>    Questo programma era un grande passo sia per Christine che per me per molti motivi. Per me riguardava il condividere la responsabilità di facilitare un evento di drum circle con altre persone. In questo programma mi fidai abbastanza delle competenze di facilitazione di Christine da lasciare andare il rassicurante stile di facilitazione ‘uno alla volta’ ed abbracciare un processo veramente collaborativo. Per Christine rappresentava sia un riconoscimento da parte mia per quanto riguardava la maestria delle sue competenze di facilitazione, che anche un passaggio della torcia da parte mia, quando da quel momento in poi sarebbe diventata una delle principali facilitatrici di eventi ritmici della comunità di musicoterapia.</p><p>    Christine ed io passammo circa un’ora a pianificare con cura ed esaminare la progressione di passi del drum circle che avremmo facilitato quella notte. Avevamo ambedue sviluppato una relazione con questa comunità di musicoterapia durante un periodo di molti anni. Erano diventati un gruppo che abbracciava gli eventi ritmici come parte della propria pratica professionale e come parte del proprio stile di vita.</p><p>    Molti degli entusiasti partecipanti arrivarono così presto alla location che ci aiutarono a sistemare le sedie e piazzare gli strumenti della Remo per l’evento.</p><p>La sala da ballo si riempì velocemente di 800 eccitati musicoterapeuti da tutto il mondo, per la maggior parte donne. Si sedettero immediatamente ed iniziarono a suonare e furono ""in pieno groove"" entro qualche minuto. </p><p>La ""Chiamata Dei Tamburi"" andò come pianificata, ma presto l’esperienza si sviluppò oltre ogni pianificazione che io e Christine avessimo previsto.<br/>    Questi suonatori vissero l'evoluzione da individui a consapevolezza di gruppo a ensemble di percussioni già nella prima mezz’ora dell’evento. Lo spirito e la spontaneità permeavano l’intero evento. Ogni pochi minuti qualcuno o qualche spicchio del cerchio lanciava un nuovo movimento ritmico, vocale o fisico nel mix e tutti gli altri del gruppo rispondevano.  Già in un momento all’inizio dell’evento Christine ed io ci guardammo e riconoscemmo che avevamo una “tigre da tenere per la coda”, che avremmo dovuto buttare fuori dalla finestra tutti i nostri accurati piani di facilitazione e procedere con il flusso.</p><p>    E così fluì. In diversi momenti stavamo volando come uno stormo di gabbiani in una direzione musicale ed improvvisamente da uno dei suonatori veniva introdotto un nuovo elemento . Entro il tempo di un battito di cuore l’intero stormo rispondeva facendo un tuffo ritmico e poi decollando verso un’altra direzione musicale. Per il resto del programma noi facilitatori seguimmo gli impulsi spontanei del gruppo ed aiutammo facilitando le risposte del gruppo durante le sue sequenze musicali in evoluzione.</p><p>Questo drum circle,  composto “da un solo cuore ed una sola mente”, invece che essere io e Christine ad offrire al gruppo una cavalcata sulle montagne russe del ritmo, offrì a noi la cavalcata sulle montagne russe. Per tutte le persone coinvolte fu veramente una serata magica ed indimenticabile.""</p><h2>

---Estratti Dal libro: COSA POSSO FARE PER SERVIRE IL CERCHIO?La facilitazione è una forma d’arte orientata al servizio.“Cosa posso fare per servire questo cerchio in questo momento?” è un mantra che ti può aiutare a mantenere i tuoi intenti nella giusta direzione, mentre ti trovi ad avere a che fare con tutti gli elementi che ti circondano in un evento ritmico.La facilitazione del drum circle è un atto di servizio verso i partecipanti all’evento, piuttosto che una performance d’arte.La vera intenzione di un facilitatore di drum circle è quella di guidare i partecipanti a suonare al più alto livello delle loro abilità, piuttosto che offrire una grande performance di facilitazione.Anche se la facilitazione è basata su fondamentali principi di leadership, il tuo miglior intento è quello di portare il gruppo dove questo vuole andare, anche se dove loro vogliono andare è diverso da dove pensavi che li avresti portati.Vuoi ascoltare e seguire le persone che stai guidando. Idealmente userai il tuo radar per ricevere le informazioni di cui hai bisogno per prendere la giusta decisione nel momento giusto.Per attivare e mantenere attivo questo tipo di radar ti suggerisco di mantenere continuamente la seguente domanda come un mantra nella tua mente, mentre stai facilitando:“Cosa posso fare per servire questo cerchio in questo momento?”La maggior parte delle informazioni di cui hai bisogno per facilitare con successo il tuo cerchio è presente nella musica e nel ritmo creati dai partecipanti. Con un mantra di servizio nella tua testa e nel tuo cuore, puoi rimanere aperto a tutto il potenziale musicale presente nel gruppo. Questo ti offrirà molte possibilità di facilitazione, in ogni cangiante momento musicale.Usare un mantra di servizio può esserti d’aiuto in tanti modi, mentre faciliti.Molte volte mentre sono fuori dal cerchio ed aspetto che si sviluppi un punto di transizione, ho una brillante idea di facilitazione. Ho scoperto che più è brillante la mia idea, più sto ascoltando la mia idea invece che i partecipanti. Più sono distratto dalla mia idea, più grande è il casino che faccio con la musica del gruppo quando entro nel cerchio per facilitare quell’idea.Se invece nella mia testa e nel mio cuore c’è un mantra di servizio proprio mentre porto questa idea nel cerchio, allora è più facile che io inserisca la mia idea in una prospettiva appropriata in relazione ai miei intenti di facilitazione. Quando dunque ascolto la musica che arriva dai suonatori nel cerchio, sono ispirato a facilitare una sequenza che abbia che fare con quel momento.Qualche volta quando raggiungo il centro del cerchio mi accorgo che la mia brillante idea non è poi la cosa giusta da fare in quel momento. Ascoltando il mantra più che la mia idea, posso evitare di creare per me stesso un’esperienza di apprendimento del facilitatore, che però interrompa il flusso ritmico del gruppo invece che migliorarlo.Il mantra “Cosa posso fare per servire questo cerchio in questo momento” è specialmente utile quando ti trovi fuori dal cerchio.Ascoltare l’""uno"" del gruppo dall’esterno del tuo cerchio è pericoloso. Qualche volta il vero uno non è un numero, ma é in realtà l’inizio di un ciclo ritmico o musicale. Quindi vuoi ascoltare dov’è l’uno a partire dal centro del cerchio. Quando infatti sei fuori dal Drum Circle, non importa dove tu sia in piedi, udrai i suonatori vicini vicino a te molto di più che le altre sezioni della tua drum-circle-orchestra. Ciò che tu odi è una versione distorta della canzone di percussioni che sta venendo creata. Potresti sentire l’inizio del ciclo di una particolare sezione musicale, ma non nel contesto dell’intero gruppo.Per ascoltare il vero ""uno"" del drum circle hai bisogno di ascoltare il gruppo dal centro del cerchio. Più grande il cerchio, più lontano ti trovi dal punto di orchestrazione e quindi la tua sensibilità di dove sia l’uno del gruppo risulterà più distorta.Ecco perché negli eventi di drum circle più grandi prenoto una sedia nel cerchio centrale, come mio luogo dove stare quando ""mi tolgo dai piedi"".Molti facilitatori, incluso me, qualche volta sentono da fuori dal cerchio quello che pensano essere l’uno.Poi, senza ascoltare il gruppo, portano quell’uno percepito dentro il punto di orchestrazione e fanno ad esempio un segnale di stop sul secondo, terzo o quarto movimento reale dei partecipanti. Questo crea uno stop ritmico molto caotico, perché molti dei partecipanti sono ancora a metà del suonare un ciclo ritmico.Questa situazione, mentre entri nel centro del cerchio a facilitare, può essere evitata facilmente ricordando il mantra di servizio.Questa prospettiva ti mette nell’adesso del momento musicale, cancella qualsiasi conteggio tu stessi udendo fuori dal cerchio, e ti permette di udire e sentire la linea melodica ed il ciclo ritmico di tutto il gruppo.Il mantra di servizio, quando usato costantemente nella tua facilitazione, crea una completa gestalt che si manifesta nella tua psicologia e nella tua fisiologia. Ti aiuta a mettere la tua missione in azione.“Cosa posso fare per servire questo cerchio?” diventa un’attitudine che emana da dentro il tuo centro e si irradia in ogni azione tu compia.CREA PICCOLI SUCCESSICreare piccole esperienze ritmiche di successo nei partecipanti al tuo cerchio è un potente modo di educare il tuo gruppo e di migliorare l’autostima individuale.Piccoli successi ispirano anche una più forte consapevolezza di gruppo.Puoi facilitare una combinazione di questi piccoli successi così da guidare il gruppo verso una maturazione come ensemble di percussioni.La collaborazione implica che i partecipanti nel gruppo sono dipendenti gli uni dagli altri, nel riuscire a completare un compito.Puoi facilitare brevi sequenze di eventi collaborativi che producano cambiamenti positivi e di successo nella musica di tutto il gruppo.Creando piccoli successi nell’esperienza musicale del gruppo faciliti i seguenti aspetti del gruppo:• Transizioni musicali esperienziali che insegnino ai partecipanti specifici aspetti dell’autofacilitazione, delle dinamiche musicali e del suonare in un ensemble di percussioni.• Un ambiente di apprendimento positivo in cui i partecipanti siano raramente spinti in modalità di crisi dello studente.• Un miglioramento nell’abilità del gruppo di ascoltarsi a vicenda e di suonare insieme.• Un livello più alto di confidenza ed autostima sia personale che di gruppo.Questi piccoli successi ti aiutano anche ad evitare l’eccesso di facilitazione (over-facilitation), diminuendo la possibilità di sviluppare il burnout da facilitatore, sia per i partecipanti che per te.L’accessibilità è la chiave per facilitare esperienze di gruppo di successo, al loro massimo potenziale. Creando semplici sfide ritmiche per il tuo cerchio generi piccoli successi musicali. In questo processo costruisci anche le fondamenta di apprendimento di gruppo che incoraggiano successivi più grandi successi a livello ritmico.Rendere un evento ritmico accessibile ai principianti, mentre intanto valorizzi suonatori intermedi ed avanzati in modo che possano esprimere se stessi, è una sfida.Per affrontare questa sfida puoi facilitare piccole proposte progressive durante tutto l’evento, che permettano ai suonatori intermedi ed avanzati di esprimersi creativamente mentre i principianti imparano a padroneggiare i compiti di base.Rendi ogni passo una piccola esperienza di apprendimento evolutivo per il tuo gruppo. In questo modo ogni esperienza che faciliti diventa una piattaforma per il prossimo passo verso la tua meta principale, cioè suonare con un’orchestra di percussioni in grado di autofacilitarsi.Ciò che è buono per il cerchio è buono per il facilitatore. Creare piccoli successi può creare situazioni positive di apprendimento personale per te come facilitatore, migliorare la tua autostima e raffinare le tue competenze, i tuoi strumenti ed il tuo radar.Per evitare di “addentare un boccone più grande di quello che tu possa masticare”, usa brevi sequenze di proposte accessibili. Lascia un tempo sufficiente perché il ritmo venga suonato fra una proposta e la successiva, in modo tale da dare sia ai suonatori che a te stesso tutto il tempo per respirare nel groove.Nel frattempo gioca al limite della tua esperienza ed abilità di facilitazione, così da poter provare nuove idee, prenderti delle opportunità e creare delle sfide di apprendimento per te stesso. Questo implica che tu non ti limiti a facilitare nella sicurezza tecnica della tua area di comfort. Facendo questo limiteresti la tua opportunità di crescere e maturare come facilitatore, mandando intanto il tuo cerchio a dormire.In ogni caso, se sei un facilitatore alle prime armi, ti consiglio di sperimentare ed improvvisare soltanto uno strumento, tecnica o elemento di facilitazione alla volta. Poi, alla fine di ogni sequenza facilitata, sarà semplice per te renderti conto quale parte della tua facilitazione abbia funzionato e quale parte possa necessitare di elaborazione.Suggerimento: KISS - Mantienilo stupidamente semplice (Keep it stupidly simple).Se mentre faciliti tieni nel tuo cuore il concetto di creare piccoli successi, puoi evitare molti degli effetti collaterali negativi che accadono quando il cerchio viene costretto a fare dei passi più grandi di quelli che è pronto a fare. Alcuni di questi effetti negativi sono “modalità di crisi dello studente”, transizioni musicali fallimentari e burnout del facilitatore.Lascia che gli obiettivi per l’evento ti guidino mentre faciliti ogni proposta via via verso il raggiungimento del risultato desiderato. Mantenere questi obiettivi ti aiuterà a rimanere focalizzato sul processo che si manifesta di fronte a te. Fai un piccolo passo di facilitazione alla volta, per raggiungere le mete del gruppo mentre intanto crei un programma di successo.LA PUNTA DELL'ICEBERGQuando vedi un iceberg che fluttua nell’oceano in realtà stai vedendo meno di un quarto della sua massa. Oltre il 75% dell’iceberg è sommerso: un’ invisibile piattaforma che supporta la punta visibile al di sopra della linea dell’acqua.Strumenti e tecniche sono le parti visibili degli elementi che formano la ""Triplicità della Facilitazione Arthuriana"" (assieme all'intento, ndr).Insieme formano la punta dell’iceberg. Gli strumenti sono facili da imitare ed imparare, basta guardare altre persone che facilitano. Anche la maggior parte delle tecniche di facilitazione sono visibili, ma l'intento dietro di esse é qualche volta non visto.Il tuo intento, reso forte dalla tua mission e dalle filosofie che la supportano, è il motore che guida gli strumenti e le tecniche.Mentre faciliti un evento di Drum Circle coesivo e congruente, sono i tuoi intenti a muovere i tuoi strumenti e le tue tecniche. Sono la tua filosofia e quindi anche la tua missione ed i tuoi intenti a formare la piattaforma invisibile che tiene in piedi strumenti e tecniche.Non importa quanto bravo tu sia nell’usare strumenti e tecniche di base, dovrai avere anche una chiara intenzione, in modo da evitare di creare un Drum Circle vuoto, senza direzione e che magari non è neanche divertente.Senza una filosofia ben sviluppata del perché tu stia in mezzo ad un cerchio di suonatori mentre li dirigi, la tua facilitazione mancherà di sostanza. Senza un intento ben sviluppato, pure la punta del tuo iceberg potrebbe essere non ben visibile.Mentre avere un’esperienza come percussionista professionista, performer o insegnante di percussioni può darti un vantaggio come facilitatore di Drum Circle, invece possedere soltanto quel background e gli strumenti e le tecniche di facilitazione non è sufficiente per renderti un buon facilitatore.La tua capacità di intrattenere, la tua capacità di suonare e le competenze di linguaggio corporeo sono semplicemente degli strumenti.Per essere un facilitatore di successo hai bisogno di ascoltare il gruppo in modo da sapere quando, come e perché usare questi strumenti.Facilitare con una piena attenzione verso il tuo cerchio deriva dall’ intento di servire il gruppo.Questo intento supporta e dirige l’uso degli strumenti di facilitazione.Quando comprendi I tuoi intenti, l’esperienza del passato non influenzerà inconsciamente le tue azioni verso una manipolazione che possa ostacolare un’esperienza di successo. Segui il Gruppo che Ti Sta Seguendo""La nostra sfida come ""evangelisti ritmici"" è quella di seguire i partecipanti che pensano di stare seguendoci, ed usare l’energia e lo spirito che ci danno. Quando lo facciamo ci conduciamo a vicenda sul giusto sentiero che porta a fare musica veramente magica. Questo é accaduto a me e Christine Stevens alla prima conferenza internazionale di musicoterapia (in USA, ndr.).    Christine Stevens è una musicoterapeuta che facilita regolarmente drum circle alle conferenze di musicoterapia, che sono tradizionalmente sponsorizzate da REMO.Io e lei abbiamo una relazione di facilitazione in continua evoluzione che ha iniziato a svilupparsi fin da quando partecipò al mio primo grande training per facilitatori alla conferenza di musicoterapia a San Louis, Missouri, nel 1992.Lei era una dei 200 partecipanti a quel corso e non la incontrai personalmente se non alcuni anni dopo ad un drum circle facilitato sopratutto da uomini, alla Convention della Percussion Arts Society (PASIC).Tutti i facilitatori fecero a turno per saltare nel cerchio a mostrare i loro talenti. Fui sorpreso nel vedere questa donna folletto altamente carismatica facilitare una sequenza dinamica nel drum circle tanto bene ed anzi meglio delle sue controparti maschili. A quel tempo avevo una relazione personale con praticamente tutti i Community Drum Circle Facilitator della nostra piccola ma crescente comunità, ma non avevo mai visto o sentito dire di Christine prima di quel momento. Dopo che lei  ebbe concluso il proprio turno nel facilitare il drum circle al PASIC, camminai verso di lei e le chiesi “Dove hai imparato a facilitare così?” La sua semplice risposta fu “Da te”.Ad ogni seguente conferenza di musicoterapia, quando facilitavo drum circle o cerchi ritmici, invitavo Christine a saltare dentro e facilitare una sequenza. Ad un certo punto giunse il tempo per noi di cofacilitare veramente ad una intera conferenza di musicoterapia come partner alla pari. Questo accade alla prima conferenza internazionale di musicoterapia mai tenutasi.    Questo programma era un grande passo sia per Christine che per me per molti motivi. Per me riguardava il condividere la responsabilità di facilitare un evento di drum circle con altre persone. In questo programma mi fidai abbastanza delle competenze di facilitazione di Christine da lasciare andare il rassicurante stile di facilitazione ‘uno alla volta’ ed abbracciare un processo veramente collaborativo. Per Christine rappresentava sia un riconoscimento da parte mia per quanto riguardava la maestria delle sue competenze di facilitazione, che anche un passaggio della torcia da parte mia, quando da quel momento in poi sarebbe diventata una delle principali facilitatrici di eventi ritmici della comunità di musicoterapia.    Christine ed io passammo circa un’ora a pianificare con cura ed esaminare la progressione di passi del drum circle che avremmo facilitato quella notte. Avevamo ambedue sviluppato una relazione con questa comunità di musicoterapia durante un periodo di molti anni. Erano diventati un gruppo che abbracciava gli eventi ritmici come parte della propria pratica professionale e come parte del proprio stile di vita.    Molti degli entusiasti partecipanti arrivarono così presto alla location che ci aiutarono a sistemare le sedie e piazzare gli strumenti della Remo per l’evento.La sala da ballo si riempì velocemente di 800 eccitati musicoterapeuti da tutto il mondo, per la maggior parte donne. Si sedettero immediatamente ed iniziarono a suonare e furono ""in pieno groove"" entro qualche minuto. La ""Chiamata Dei Tamburi"" andò come pianificata, ma presto l’esperienza si sviluppò oltre ogni pianificazione che io e Christine avessimo previsto.    Questi suonatori vissero l'evoluzione da individui a consapevolezza di gruppo a ensemble di percussioni già nella prima mezz’ora dell’evento. Lo spirito e la spontaneità permeavano l’intero evento. Ogni pochi minuti qualcuno o qualche spicchio del cerchio lanciava un nuovo movimento ritmico, vocale o fisico nel mix e tutti gli altri del gruppo rispondevano.  Già in un momento all’inizio dell’evento Christine ed io ci guardammo e riconoscemmo che avevamo una “tigre da tenere per la coda”, che avremmo dovuto buttare fuori dalla finestra tutti i nostri accurati piani di facilitazione e procedere con il flusso.    E così fluì. In diversi momenti stavamo volando come uno stormo di gabbiani in una direzione musicale ed improvvisamente da uno dei suonatori veniva introdotto un nuovo elemento . Entro il tempo di un battito di cuore l’intero stormo rispondeva facendo un tuffo ritmico e poi decollando verso un’altra direzione musicale. Per il resto del programma noi facilitatori seguimmo gli impulsi spontanei del gruppo ed aiutammo facilitando le risposte del gruppo durante le sue sequenze musicali in evoluzione.Questo drum circle,  composto “da un solo cuore ed una sola mente”, invece che essere io e Christine ad offrire al gruppo una cavalcata sulle montagne russe del ritmo, offrì a noi la cavalcata sulle montagne russe. Per tutte le persone coinvolte fu veramente una serata magica ed indimenticabile.""

<h3>Combattere la Discinesia Ciliare Primaria!</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>La Discinesia Ciliare Primaria è una malattia genetica rara che colpisce prevalentemente il sottile strato di cellule ciliate che riveste tutto l'apparato respiratorio.</p>

La Discinesia Ciliare Primaria è una malattia genetica rara che colpisce prevalentemente il sottile strato di cellule ciliate che riveste tutto l'apparato respiratorio.
In condizioni normali, le ciglia di queste cellule si muovono velocemente, e col loro movimento trasportano il muco in cui sono intrappolati virus e e germi lontano dalle vie respiratorie. Nel caso dei pazienti affetti da DCP il movimento delle ciglia è scoordinato o inesistente, con tutte le ovvie conseguenze che ne derivano.
Puoi scoprire di più su questa malattia cliccando QUI
Il nostro Team di ricerca è il primo al mondo che è riuscito nel 2015 a adattare e utilizzare una sorta di bisturi genetico per la correzione del difetto alla base della DCP. 
Abbiamo utilizzato questo bisturi molecolare su alcune cellule prelevate da due pazienti, e abbiamo verificato che in un numero significativo di queste cellule le ciglia hanno ripreso a funzionare regolarmente!
Se sei curioso di sapere come funziona la procedura, clicca QUI!

Il nostro prossimo obiettivo è verificare che il procedimento che abbiamo utilizzato funzioni anche su organismi più complessi delle singole cellule.
Si tratta di un passaggio fondamentale lungo la via che porta verso una cura per la Discinesia Ciliare Primaria. Infatti, se tutto andrà per il meglio e il procedimento che abbiamo sperimentato sulle cellule in laboratorio funzionerà anche su questi animali, avremo superato l'ostacolo più impegnativo per la realizzazione di un trattamento personalizzato per i singoli pazienti.
La realizzazione di appositi sistemi di veicolazione di tale trattamento dovrà rappresentare la quarta e ultima fase di ricerca, parallelamente alle procedure per la loro certificazione e registrazione presso le autorità competenti.
Dopodiché avremmo fatto tutto quanto in nostro potere per garantire il buon funzionamento di questo sistema terapeutico, e non resterebbe che iniziare il trial clinico sui pazienti umani.




Chi siamo?

Io sono Giulia, responsabile della campagna, e quando scriverete al nostro indirizzo email crowdfundingdcppisa@gmail.com sarò la persona che vi leggerà :) . 
Qualcuno nella mia famiglia è affetto da Discinesia Ciliare Primaria e fortunatamente è un paziente del Dottor Pifferi, e questo è il motivo per cui sono direttamente interessata all'argomento di questa ricerca.. Siccome poi ho una laurea magistrale in Comunicazione, ho pensato di rendermi utile e organizzare questa campagna, in cui credo moltissimo e in cui spero crederete insieme a me!
Il Team di ricerca invece è composto da cinque medici e biologi di prim'ordine, e sono loro le persone che fanno il lavoro vero. 
Il dottor Pifferi  e il dottor Pistello  sono i responsabili della ricerca e hanno un curriculum decennale ricchissimo alle spalle, completo di pubblicazioni sui temi specifici coinvolti in questa campagna, cattedre, incarichi da revisori per riviste internazionali, e naturalmente ottimi risultati di ricerca; la dottoressa Di Cicco  , la dottoressa Piras 
 e il dottor Lai  sono accomunati da eccellenti risultati accademici, dalle diverse pubblicazioni su riviste internazionali, e dal focus specifico sulla Discinesia Ciliare Primaria di questo primo decennio del loro percorso lavorativo.

Puoi trovare QUI un riassunto un po' più dettagliato del loro curriculum, se vuoi conoscerli  meglio. 



Di quanti fondi abbiamo bisogno e per cosa?
 
Per raggiungere il prossimo step di ricerca il nostro team deve:

Ripetere e adattare il procedimento con cui abbiamo creato il nostro bisturi molecolare, per fare in modo che funzioni su tutte le diverse variazioni genetiche che portano alla Discinesia Ciliare Primaria
Utilizzare questi nuovi bisturi genetici sulle cellule malate che preleveremo dai pazienti, e verificare che funzionino anche per queste altre mutazioni genetiche

Per questi primi due step di ricerca serviranno circa 25.000 euro.
Infine, dovremo
Verificare che il nostro procedimento funzioni anche su organismi più complessi di una singola cellula
Si tratta dello step di ricerca più difficile e anche di quello più costoso; infatti per portarlo a termine serviranno circa altri 50.000 euro.
Per maggiori dettagli clicca QUI

Quello che cerchiamo di fare - con il tuo aiuto - in questa campagna di raccolta fondi, è di finanziare i primi due step e di riuscire per lo meno a iniziare a sperimentare in un modello animale. 
Come ricercatori, siamo molto attenti alla questione della sperimentazione animale e all'invasività dei nostri trattamenti; se vuoi saperne di più clicca QUI e fai scorrere la pagina.
Riuscire ad arrivare a questo livello di sperimentazione unendo le nostre forze è davvero indispensabile, perché se i primi tentativi daranno risultati positivi crediamo di poter avere qualche possibilità in più di trovare uno sponsor ""istituzionale"" che ci aiuti finanziare la ricerca fino alla sua conclusione, nonostante l'ostacolo della rarità della malattia.
E' per questo che abbiamo stabilito un primo traguardo a 66.000 euro, che copre anche i costi legati alla campagna di raccolta fondi, ed è per questo che abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto!

Proprio perché stiamo lottando per tenere viva la nostra ricerca, abbiamo deciso di tenere comunque tutti i fondi che riusciremo a raccogliere, anche se non dovessimo raggiungere l'obiettivo dei 66.000 euro, e proseguiremo il più possibile nella nostra ricerca attraverso gli step indicati sopra usando la cifra che avremo a disposizione.
Tutti i fondi confluiranno sul conto corrente dell'Associazione per lo Studio delle Malattie Infantili Respiratorie Croniche (A.S.M.I.R.C.), l'associazione senza scopo di lucro fondata dal professor Pifferi e dal professor Pistello - responsabili della nostra ricerca - con lo scopo di sostenere e promuovere lo studio di malattie respiratorie come la Discinesia Ciliare Primaria, e saranno utilizzati esclusivamente per finanziare questa ricerca e per coprire i minimi costi di questa campagna di raccolta fondi.

</div><div> </div><div>
<i>     In an era where children grow up with super heroes who have ripped bodies and idealized machismo, I think we need a different kind of hero. A cat. She doesn't have great physical strength and she doesn't have clever weapons. She does, however, have a special power. Her power is her imagination. When faced with challenges, Mia Meow resorts to her creativity and artistry. And then, magical things happen...

  </i>
</div><div><br/></div><div>     Hi there! I am Artist BZTAT, and I am creating a book entitled, <i>“Oh My! Mia Meow!”</i> It is a fun book about a cat named Mia Meow who has a big imagination. In the book, her creativity and imagination lead her on a great adventure, allowing her to explore new places and meet interesting new friends. It is an adventure that is revealed through colorful illustrations that intrigue and enamor children, and thus, inspire their imaginations.

  </div><div><br/></div><div>     The book is the next step in fascinating journey that I began in the fall of 2015. Working as a teaching artist for an arts integration program, I developed the Mia Meow character in a series of whimsical paintings based on my pet cat. I used the paintings and told stories about Mia Meow to introduce visual art lessons with preschool students.

  </div><div><br/></div><div>     The kids LOVED Mia Meow! They loved the character, the paintings, the stories, and the art activities. My students greeted me with anticipation each week, excitedly awaiting Mia Meow’s newest adventure. They quickly grew fond of repeating a line from the Mia Meow story: <em><i>“Oh my, Oh my, Mia Meow!</i>”</em>  Their enthusiasm inspired me to create a book so all children could enjoy Mia Meow!

 
 </div><div><br/></div><div>     The story for the book is simple and fun and sure to delight young readers. It is more than a simple romp of fun, however. The story also teaches children that they can overcome obstacles with creative thinking and imaginative resourcefulness. I know that the book will have great impact on children, because the artwork and story have already warmed the hearts of many young students in my classes. It is my goal to get the book out into the world so it can be enjoyed by many more children.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">There are an endless number of self-development books, courses and
seminars out there, and people spend 1000's (and more!) on these, but what
they really take away, are the short little insights and inspirations that resonate
and stick with them. This is what captures the essence of people’s contexts. What
I aim to do is to capture and share those insights and inspirations, gathered from a range of thinkers, speakers, writers and philosophers, and instead of
focusing on just one area, (which most books and products do), I want to publish a short compilation, for each day of the year, that covers
the six areas of: emotions, mindset, spirituality, finances,
success and physical well-being. This will offer a quick way to help frame positive thinking
for each day.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>So, a little about me… My name is Noleen, I was
born in South Africa in the 70's, and through the years I found my escape during some of my toughest moments, in books. I read whatever I could, and gathered little and large nuggets of content that motivated me… often, helping me get me beyond my circumstances, (like when I battled cancer a few years ago, or when I was facing redundancy, lost all that I had and hit an all time low a year and a half ago!). </p>
<p>I live in the UK and spend a fair amount of
time in the US, and go to a number of conferences, events, workshops and the
like, and see the tens of thousands that people spend trying to improve their
lives and change their mindset, and i<span style=""background-color: initial;"">t strikes me time and time again, that each of
the trainers/facilitators connect with people in exactly the same way… with a
few insights and inspirations… those nuggets that shift and move people. I
believe that there is a way of reaching far more people, more affordably, in a
way that makes as profound a difference to them, and I truly hope that you will
help me achieve this. 20% of profits of books sold, (after meeting commitments to contributors who are receiving a copy), will go toward Macmillan Cancer Care and The Autism Directory. </span></p>

<div>
<p>I want for this to be a lovely, high quality
(so it lasts!), glossy, full color published work. At the moment, I have
content, but require editing, formatting, design, images and layout of the book,
which will cost approximately £2800, most of the images in the book will be
used in the calendar, so costs can be saved on that, but formatting and layout
for the calendar will be approx. £1800. The publishing for approximately 500 copies
of the book and 500 copies of the calendar will be £7000, the application
development will be approx. £950, and crowdfunding fees 5% £627.50.</p>

</div></div>","In Summary 
There are an endless number of self-development books, courses and
seminars out there, and people spend 1000's (and more!) on these, but what
they really take away, are the short little insights and inspirations that resonate
and stick with them. This is what captures the essence of people’s contexts. What
I aim to do is to capture and share those insights and inspirations, gathered from a range of thinkers, speakers, writers and philosophers, and instead of
focusing on just one area, (which most books and products do), I want to publish a short compilation, for each day of the year, that covers
the six areas of: emotions, mindset, spirituality, finances,
success and physical well-being. This will offer a quick way to help frame positive thinking
for each day.

So, a little about me… My name is Noleen, I was
born in South Africa in the 70's, and through the years I found my escape during some of my toughest moments, in books. I read whatever I could, and gathered little and large nuggets of content that motivated me… often, helping me get me beyond my circumstances, (like when I battled cancer a few years ago, or when I was facing redundancy, lost all that I had and hit an all time low a year and a half ago!). 
I live in the UK and spend a fair amount of
time in the US, and go to a number of conferences, events, workshops and the
like, and see the tens of thousands that people spend trying to improve their
lives and change their mindset, and it strikes me time and time again, that each of
the trainers/facilitators connect with people in exactly the same way… with a
few insights and inspirations… those nuggets that shift and move people. I
believe that there is a way of reaching far more people, more affordably, in a
way that makes as profound a difference to them, and I truly hope that you will
help me achieve this. 20% of profits of books sold, (after meeting commitments to contributors who are receiving a copy), will go toward Macmillan Cancer Care and The Autism Directory. 


   What's Needed?

I want for this to be a lovely, high quality
(so it lasts!), glossy, full color published work. At the moment, I have
content, but require editing, formatting, design, images and layout of the book,
which will cost approximately £2800, most of the images in the book will be
used in the calendar, so costs can be saved on that, but formatting and layout
for the calendar will be approx. £1800. The publishing for approximately 500 copies
of the book and 500 copies of the calendar will be £7000, the application
development will be approx. £950, and crowdfunding fees 5% £627.50.


What Do You Get?

If the overall goal is reached:

For every £10 you'll get a massive THANK YOU! on the wall of gratitude I'll be setting up for this project, as well a PDF copy of the book, and free access to the app. 
For every £20 you'll get a massive THANK YOU! on the Facebook wall of gratitude I'll be setting up for this project, as well a PDF copy of the book, free access to the app, along with a signed paperback version. 
For every £50 you'll get a massive THANK YOU! on the Facebook wall of gratitude I'll be setting up for this project, as well a PDF copy of the book,  free access to the app, along with a signed paperback version, and a desktop calendar.

What If I Don't Reach My Goal?
I have a number of smaller goals that I can meet instead, like formatting editing and designing smaller sections of the book, getting the app done etc (depending on the amount raised)... and I will continue to work on gradually completing this project, and raising the funds in order to see it realized, even if it takes a little longer.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Help us <i>Launch</i> Riddled with Arrows Lit</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Mission:</h3>
<p>Many literary magazines say they don't want ""writing about writing"". As writers, we can’t wrap our heads around that. What wordsmith doesn’t have a poem about the agony and bliss of poetry; a story about an author writing a story; a notebook full of <i>I-don’t-know-what-to-call-this</i> bemoaning a missing muse, an empty page, a heart that wants to write but just can’t find the words?</p>
<p>Writing about writing is a time-honored art. Even Sappho indulged in it:</p>
<p><i>“May I write words more naked than flesh, stronger than bone, more resilient than sinew, sensitive than nerve…”</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Riddled with Arrows Literary Journal</strong></i> was created as a safe haven for poetry about poetry and prose about prose. More than this, we seek to compile a body of literature that flies in the face of this arbitrary prohibition against Writing writing.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2017,<i> <strong>Riddled with Arrows</strong> </i>will publish (short) metafiction and metapoems, and writing that celebrates the process and product of writing as art. No restrictions on genre or form, so long as the work is about writing, straight up.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal:</h3>
<p><strong><i>Riddled with Arrows</i></strong> will be a paying market, because we believe that writers should be compensated (""exposure"" don't buy groceries).  However, we don't have a lot of funds to start with, so we are reaching out to the literary community to help us achieve our goals.</p>
<p>We're shooting for $500 - a nice nest egg to draw from for our first four issues - but there's NO MINIMUM level that we need to reach.  ANY DONATION, no matter how small, will go to pay our future contributors.</p>

Any assistance to the campaign will make a difference!  Here’s some ways you can partner with me:
Pray for me as I move forward in what God has called me to do
Help get the word out and make some noise about the Soul H2O Devotional

I’ve worked with Word Alive Press, Goodworks Jewelry and Crossroads Relief & Development to offer you many options that will bless and refresh you while you partner with me in bringing clean water to people in need!The Goodworks Jewelry I've chosen for this campaign are some of my favourite pieces in Helena Cho's line.  Both the bracelet & Necklace will provide funds to dig wells in third world countries!If you look at the Book Sampler you can read details on my partnership with Crossroads Relief & Development Water Projects.  This campaign and proceeds from future sales of Soul H2O will help fund their Water Projects.*** All donations to Crossroads Relief and Development Water Projects will be receipted by Crossroads R&D.THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORTTHE DONATIONS YOU MAKE WILL HELP TO BRING CLEAN WATER TO PEOPLE IN NEED AROUND THE GLOBE AND HELP SPREAD THE REFRESHING MESSAGE OF SOUL H2O.PLEASE GIVE GENEROUSLY AND SHARE THIS CAMPAIGNIT’S MY PRAYER THAT YOU’RE BLESSED AND REFRESHED!​​Risks & ChallengesApproaching the publishing world as a career is not an easy goal (not for the faint of heart?), but I’ve never been one to take the easy way out!  In publishing my first devotional I bore the full expense and hadn’t spoken in years.  In the past three years God has done the miraculous and opened up doors for me are astounding.  Water In The Desert was republished by Word Alive.  They have taken on my husband and I in a co-publishing arrangement.  I am traveling places to speak that I’ve always wanted to visit and my books are going places I’ve never been.  I’m hearing stories that Water In The Desert is being used in places I may never get to go: a Ladies’ Bible Study group in Mexico and a girls’ home in Zimbabwe just to name a few.  I look forward to hearing the same for Soul H2O!  The team God is putting around me to launch this new book is overwhelming; publishers, publicists, fellow authors and supporters.  The opportunity to bring my books into the US market is a Canadian authors dream.  It would seem unattainable without the opportunities I’ve been presented with for a US promotional campaign and Word Alive having secured US distribution for my books.  I believe God has perfectly positioned me for for this next step.  Here is where your contributions will go: ·       Book cover design $500·       Photos $300.00·       Overall graphic designing website, launch & promotions; related to book $1,500·       Editing $2,000·       Office supplies, software, secure data storage $200·       Printing and delivery of books $4,500.00·       Book Launch Expense (Promoting in Canada & USA) $1000.00·       Canadian Promotion of Book $3,000.00·       US Promotion of Book in the new year $5,000.00·       Travel to promote book $1500.00·       Crowdfunding fees (5%) + Credit card fees (3%) $1,600TOTAL LAUNCH BUDGET: $21,100.00*Donations To Crossroads Relief & Development from Contributors will be on top of these expenses.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I had moved to Iowa a couple years ago to be closer to my wife's family, and was overjoyed by the number of writers and soon to be writers living and thriving in Iowa City. I was fascinated and sought to learn more about this literary oasis of the Midwest. In the winter of 2016, I pitched a magazine article concept to Writer's Digest about Iowa City being the UNESCO's City of Literature. The article is in the July/August 2017 edition of the magazine and you can find it in any bookstore or newsstand that carries the magazine. </p>
<p>While I was creating the article I was finishing my book<i> Cucamonga Valley Wine- The Lost Empire of American Wine Making </i>with History Press . I pitched them the idea of creating a book that expanded on the history of Iowa City from a literature and writing point of view. </p>
<p>Iowa city has produced some of the most renowned writers and playwrights in the world such as Kurt Vonnegut, Rita Dove, Marilynne Robinson, Jane Smiley, Ayana Maathis, Tennessee Williams, John Irving, and more. Iowa City has also produced over 30 Pulitzer Prize winners dating back to Frank Luther Mott in 1939 for his <i>A History of American Magazines</i>. </p>
<p>In April of 2017, I signed on with History Press to begin the process of writing the book, and it has been a much larger undertaking than I had anticipated, but a challenge that I wholeheartedly welcome.  </p>
<p>As deadlines loom, I find myself in a bit of a fix. I need between 65 and 70 pictures to go along with my narrative, and the scanned items with permissions are due in mid July. I have found most of my pictures that will fit perfectly with the book from various archives, but to publish and use these photos is not free. In fact I must pay $50.00 a picture. ($3250-$3500). </p>
<p>Like many publishers, History Press does not cover these expenses- and so I must raise them myself. Without the funds I am afraid I may not be able to continue with the book. </p>
<p>This book is extremely important as next year, Iowa City will be the host of the other 20 countries who make up the other UNESCO City's of Literature around the world and they do not have a definitive book to give and sell at this momentous event. </p>
<p>I have also conducted interviews with many of the important figures who made up the literary scene and made Iowa City what it is today including Hualin Nieh Engle- International,  multi- award winning author, and wife to Paul Engle, who was the pioneer of the Iowa Writer's Workshop. These people are getting up in age and I would hate to see their fantastic stories lost. </p>
<p>I am an author of 13 books, a journalist who has written for the New York Times, Reuters, Today Show, and Bloomberg News. I have written for a number of magazines such as INC, Winemaker, and Writers Digest. </p>
<p>Success as a writer does not mean riches. I am an artist, which means, to those who understand, I am not flush in money.  So this is a labor of love and passion at this point. I would not ask for assistance unless it was needed, but as you look at the perks you will see that you will get something for your generous support. </p>
<p><strong>Where do the funds go?</strong> </p>
<p>The good news is that the funds will go directly to the Iowa City Library, the University of Iowa Special Collections, and the Iowa Historical Society- all of which are underfunded and  are non-profits. These funds are not being used in any other way other than that. Not only are you helping make this book a reality, you are directly supporting the arts. </p>
<p>In return, I am offering perks such as sign copies of the book, acknowledgements in the book and as the campaign progresses even greater perks. </p>
<p>If the goal is not reached, I will donate the funds to the institutions I mentioned above. </p>

<p>In Africa, just like in many other underdeveloped parts of the world, women are seen and treated as inferior to men in many ways. They are not allowed to do or say as they please because from a very young age they are raised with the mentality that they should respect and oblige to what the men in their life tell them to even if he is younger, with no questions asked.</p>
<p>Born and raised in England, I’ve been coming to Somalia from a very young age, but it wasn’t until September 2015 when I decided to live here permanently. It was my move to Somalia that has opened my eyes to many things, including how bad gender inequality really is.</p>
<p>The idea of starting a magazine has been playing on my mind for about 2 years now but I wasn’t 100% sure what I wanted it to be about. I’ve been looking for ideas ever since. Opening my online cosmetics store, getting married and becoming a mother has been my biggest inspirations on what I wanted my magazine to be based on.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of BE Magazine (BEM).</p>
<p>I want BE Magazine to inspire and motivate women. To let them know that we are not inferior to men, nor equal but we have our own worth. I want to be able to make as many women as possible feel confident and proud of their skin and body, to love themselves for who they are and also support one another.

</div></div>","In Africa, just like in many other underdeveloped parts of the world, women are seen and treated as inferior to men in many ways. They are not allowed to do or say as they please because from a very young age they are raised with the mentality that they should respect and oblige to what the men in their life tell them to even if he is younger, with no questions asked.
Born and raised in England, I’ve been coming to Somalia from a very young age, but it wasn’t until September 2015 when I decided to live here permanently. It was my move to Somalia that has opened my eyes to many things, including how bad gender inequality really is.
The idea of starting a magazine has been playing on my mind for about 2 years now but I wasn’t 100% sure what I wanted it to be about. I’ve been looking for ideas ever since. Opening my online cosmetics store, getting married and becoming a mother has been my biggest inspirations on what I wanted my magazine to be based on.
That was the beginning of BE Magazine (BEM).
I want BE Magazine to inspire and motivate women. To let them know that we are not inferior to men, nor equal but we have our own worth. I want to be able to make as many women as possible feel confident and proud of their skin and body, to love themselves for who they are and also support one another. I want them to know they have a voice and that they are worthy.

<p><strong>The Impact of Amazing</strong></p>
<p>Historically Amazing was not only the first science fiction magazine, its original editor, Hugo Gernsback basically invented the field. We think we've also made a great start in our first year.

<ul>
<li>With just over $30,000 raised in our first crowdfunding we not only funded the first issue - but through careful costs management, we published for an <strong><i>entire</i></strong> year!</li>
<li>We also not only published a digital and print edition - but have started an <strong>audiobook </strong>for each issue's fiction as well.</li>
<li>We're successfully reaching out to the community to sell and run advertisements for authors, conventions and more - at prices that are <strong><i>easily affordable</i></strong>!</li>

<p>We had to face a major hurdle in our first year. We raised enough to cover one issue. But by careful management of our funds, finding more advertisers, and finding the best and most affordable printers we kept going throughout the entire first year.</p>
<p>So what are the risks this time?</p>

</div>
<p>Have you ever had the feeling that you were on the cusp of something HUGE!? This book is the launchpad in the massive platform of Self-Love I'm creating: Books, workbooks, hynotherepeutic audios, videos, live workshops, speaking at organizations, and a TED Talk. I plan to have a yearly retreat, as well as produce a web show of rapid hypnosis and speed coaching to help people change their lives in an instant.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>To change the world we must first change ourselves</span></li>
<li>I have a huge platform of 300K social media followers who have changed their lives from my videos. Getting married, getting paid more, moving, traveling, following their dreams and overall loving themselves.</li>
<li>I've been making videos for 10 years, and now realize everyone learns differently:<br/>Visual: Videos &amp; demonstrations<br/>Audio: Through hearing and listening<br/>Kinestetic: Through feeling and intuition<br/>Audio-Digital: Manually at live workshops and seminars</li>
</ul>

The Impact

Have you ever had the feeling that you were on the cusp of something HUGE!? This book is the launchpad in the massive platform of Self-Love I'm creating: Books, workbooks, hynotherepeutic audios, videos, live workshops, speaking at organizations, and a TED Talk. I plan to have a yearly retreat, as well as produce a web show of rapid hypnosis and speed coaching to help people change their lives in an instant.

To change the world we must first change ourselves
I have a huge platform of 300K social media followers who have changed their lives from my videos. Getting married, getting paid more, moving, traveling, following their dreams and overall loving themselves.
I've been making videos for 10 years, and now realize everyone learns differently:Visual: Videos & demonstrationsAudio: Through hearing and listeningKinestetic: Through feeling and intuitionAudio-Digital: Manually at live workshops and seminars

SHIPPING:
Shipping in the US  will have a flat rate of $1 for small packages, $5 for medium and $10 for large . International shipments will be charged a flat rate of $25 and $35 to cover the shipping cost. If you have a cheaper method of shipping, please let me know, and when it is time to ship your package if the rate is more than you paid I may contact you to see how you'd like to handle it.

Paperback & Hardcover books (including journal & affirmations booklet) will be delivered in November 2018

Risks & Challenges
As with any book printing much of the timeline depends on the actual printing. It is the goal that the books will be ready by November 2018, however something unforeseen may delay that

<p><strong>My Qualifications: </strong> I am an art journalist and local historian. Since 2011, I’ve published more than 10,000 articles on art, theater and indie film on my blog and in local newspapers and magazines. But I also am passionate about sharing stories about our early origins with the people who visit and live in the town of Fort Myers, Florida, where I live. </p>
<p><strong>The Project: </strong>About a year and a half ago, Robin Tuthill and I began researching and writing a new book (our second, but more on that later). It chronicles the birth and evolution of the Fort Myers Fire Department. But more, it recounts how Fort Myers grew from a dusty frontier town on the banks of the Caloosahatchee River in Southwest Florida into the tarpon and citrus packing capital of the world in spite of a series of devastating early fires. In the process, the book transports readers back in time, providing a glimpse into what life was like in Fort Myers between 1886 and 1915. We call the book <i>Epic Fires of Fort Myers: How A Series of Early Fires Influenced the Town's Development</i>.</p>
<p>The residents and visitors of any town benefit greatly from an appreciation of their origins. That is certainly true here. But <i>Epic Fires of Fort Myers</i> also provides pithy present-day fire prevention and life safety analysis and tips compliments of current Fort Myers Fire Chief John Caufield and Fire Marshal Jen Campbell, as well as former Chiefs Richard Chappelle and Bill Conrod. The insights they impart could one day save lives!</p>
<p><strong>Funding &amp; Perks:</strong> In the process of researching the book, so many new facts, figures and absorbing anecdotes surfaced that the book morphed from a single short historical into two spellbinding volumes. But that entails twice the publishing fees and printing costs than originally anticipated. The costs of publishing Vol. 1 are covered, and it will hit bookstores in early November. But while the manuscript for Volume 2 is done, an additional $6,250 is needed to get it to market.</p>
<p>For a variety of reasons, we have decided to self-publish Epic Fires of Fort Myers. After considerable market research and analysis, we chose to utilize the services of a Denver-based indie publisher by the name of Outskirts Press. The first $1,750 of this funding goal covers the publication fee that Outskirts charges. The balance represents the cost of printing up to 1,000 copies of the book.</p>
<p>To provide you with more than the personal satisfaction that goes with helping preserve and promote our town’s unique and fascinating history, I’m offering a number of perks, which you'll find to the right.</p>
<p><strong>What's in Vol. 2:</strong> So what will you and other readers find in Volume 2 of <i>Epic Fires of Fort Myers</i>?</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapter 1 covers the fire that destroyed the Lee County Packing House in January of 1914, but it also recalls that Fort Myers had a thriving waterfront back in the day – in fact, more business was transacted on the town’s bustling piers and wharves than in the business district itself!</li>
<li>In Chapter 2, readers will learn about the town’s most important steamship line, and how it lost its two most important vessels in the span of less than six months – the <i>Planter </i>to fire and the <i>Mildred </i>to a midnight ramming in the waters off Sarasota.</li>
<li>Chapter 3 treats readers to a recounting of the real-life game of monopoly waged in Fort Myers by Walter Langford, “Wild” Bill Towles, Harvie Heitman and Peter Tonnelier. Imagine, for a moment, scores of shopkeepers, customers and residents watching in open-jaw amazement as construction workers rolled the gargantuan entry stone of the First National Bank building down First Street like an army of ancient Egyptians. Or County Commission Chair Bill Towles standing guard with his shotgun as workers dismantled the old wooden courthouse under the light of a bonfire in order to thwart his opponents, including one Harvie Heitman, from getting another injunction to prevent the construction of the structure that now sits at the corner of Broadway and Main. But it was Peter Tonnelier who was poised to win the board game being played out in the streets of Fort Myers – until a fire burned down the Michigan Hotel and several of Tonnelier’s other buildings, almost taking the First National Bank, Earnhardt and Heitman-Evans buildings with them!</li>
<li>Chapter 4 revisits Fort Myers’ enduring love affair with Thomas Edison and the movie industry his kinetoscope spawned - and the rivalry that developed between the town’s two seminal theaters, the Court and the Grand. You won’t believe the inventive marketing ploys that Jno T. Hendry and K.A. Bryant came up with to gain a competitive edge, but all that came to a smoldering finish when the Grand went up in flames in February of 1915. But if you think that meant that Bryant won the contest, guess again. That’s when Harvie Heitman jumped in with his 500-seat Arcade Theater – the only one of the three that survives to this day.</li>
</ul>
<p>You’ll see Fort Myers through fresh eyes as a result of this read. And for that reason, I hope you’ll join in my cloudfunding campaign to bring the book to market.</p>

Three years ago, we teamed up to write <i>Female Pioneers of Fort Myers: Women Who Made a Difference in the City’s Development</i>. Available on Amazon and in the Edison &amp; Ford Winter Estates gift shop, <i>Female Pioneers </i>tells the never-before-told and nearly forgotten stories of 24 women who helped settle Fort Myers and convert it from a coarse, crass cow town into a center for commerce and tourism.

<p><strong>Our Marketing Plan:  </strong>While both volumes of <i>Epic Fires</i> will be available on Amazon and in bookstores, we will promote the book primarily through speaking engagements before area social organizations, civic groups and gated communities. In fact, many of the groups who heard us speak about <i>Female Pioneers</i> have already invited us back with the new books.</p>
<p><strong>Risks: </strong>The cost of publishing/printing Vol. 2 can always be paid out of the net proceeds realized upon the sale of Vol. 1. But that will delay the publication of Vol. 2 given that there's a limit on the number of speaking engagements we can do in a week, month or tourism season.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways to Help:</strong> If you’re not able to help financially, there’s still plenty you can do. Spread the word through social media, emails, word of mouth and the Indiegogo share tools. Invite us to speak to your group or organization. And by all means, get a copy of the books once they hit bookstores. It will change the way you see Fort Myers and enhance your trips downtown forever more.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>A good book needs <strong>professional editing</strong>. Editing is calculated <u><i>by word count</i></u> and we are looking at est. $3500 - $4500 AUD for the full book.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>ALMOST THERE - YAYYY</strong></u></h2>
<p> </p>

<p>There is no risk for the backers. I offer full transparency and will send out Newsletters after the crowdfunding is finished.</p>

<p>The editing takes usually 3 - 6 weeks. When my draft returns I will sit with my Copywriter to apply the editing amendments.</p>
<p>Next up, handing-in the edited version to my publishing house in Melbourne, AU and Atlanta, USA whom I am in touch with.</p>
<p>For the rare case, I will be turned down, after having already agreed to publish my book once it's edited, I will become the next J.K.Rowling and keep knocking doors... She knocked 51 doors.</p>
<p>Or I become the next Lisa Genova, who self-published ""Still Alice"" first and later was signed by Simon and Schuster.</p>
<p>This book will be in the shelves by August 2019!</p>
<p><strong>Success Guarantee</strong></p>
<p>The timing of consumers searching for answers is pivoting. 2019 and 2020 are forecasted to be the most profitable years in self-help books, yet. ***Forbes magazine 01/19</p>

Hi, I am Caroline, global citizen, and good-mood enthusiast.
 
My book is autobiographical. It’s about finding my lost heart and soul. The newer, more relatable version of ""Eat, Pray, Love"",meets ""Wild"", meets ""Walk in the woods"" if you will.
 
100 industry professionals have received samples of the book and 87 came back with the combined feedback,""There is no doubt, this book will be a success.""
 
 
The Story:

on my 30th Birthday, left by the love of my life, one day before my best friend’s wedding in Cancun
fast Forward, 4 months later, leaving with nothing but a backpack and a teddy bear
running away from life
learning aura seeking in Nepal
attending 18 days a Vipassana meditation retreat in Thailand
speaking to an elephant in Cambodia
getting sensual in Bali with a Spanish Yoga teacher, only to be beaten up by my Indonesian host when catching us
almost raped in Singapore only to then fall for my rescue host
9 destinations
5000 Euro budget
all as a Couchsurfer

 
The reader's outcome:

the desire to take their lives in their own hands
encouragement to follow their real desire
being able to break free
being inspired to change their direction of thoughts
educational insight about the spiritual world
and a good time reading an entertaining novel

 

What We Need & What You Get
 
A good book needs professional editing. Editing is calculated by word count and we are looking at est. $3500 - $4500 AUD for the full book.
 
ALMOST THERE - YAYYY
 


Graphic Design. Every book needs a cover, and parts of the story of how my heart changed from a black-spiky-solid-rock into a glooming open heart are documented. We are looking at $1200 AUD.

Copywriting, to apply the editing amendments but keeping my tone of voice, we are looking at est. $2500 AUD.
A marketing campaign to spread the word about the book is est. with $5500 AUD.

Merchandise $3500 AUD.

 
You'll see there is so much more to it, however, getting half the money with this project will take a tremendous weight off my shoulders. Being an expat with restricted earnings opportunities due to my Visa regulations limits my own financial input.
 
Our perks are designed to give back. This is the subline of the book altogether.
 
Every Dollar counts, no amount is too little.
 
Thank you
Up to $20 AUD, we'll give you a personal shout out on social media, telling the world how amazing you are for engaging in our project.

The Impact
 
With your support, we will get the book out into the world and start transforming hearts and minds.
 
You will be part of:

helping readers to be encouraged to ask themselves if that’s all life has to offer.
helping to teach the reader about a lifestyle adjustment and the power of mindfulness.
helping me to give back and fulfill the promise to hundreds of enquiries.
helping to give others the courage to live their dream.

MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE DOERS rather than followers.
 

Risks & Challenges
There is no risk for the backers. I offer full transparency and will send out Newsletters after the crowdfunding is finished.
Once you've helped me to get enough money to professionally edit my book, I will send my final draft off as soon as I have received the funds.
The editing takes usually 3 - 6 weeks. When my draft returns I will sit with my Copywriter to apply the editing amendments.
Next up, handing-in the edited version to my publishing house in Melbourne, AU and Atlanta, USA whom I am in touch with.
For the rare case, I will be turned down, after having already agreed to publish my book once it's edited, I will become the next J.K.Rowling and keep knocking doors... She knocked 51 doors.
Or I become the next Lisa Genova, who self-published ""Still Alice"" first and later was signed by Simon and Schuster.
This book will be in the shelves by August 2019!
Success Guarantee
The timing of consumers searching for answers is pivoting. 2019 and 2020 are forecasted to be the most profitable years in self-help books, yet. ***Forbes magazine 01/19

<p>My name's Roy, I'm a Husband to be, a Father and a full time musician. Life is good... but do you ever have those overwhelming sensations of nostalgia. A time when everything seemed easier but the world was bigger. A time in fact, when you were more vulnerable but felt safer. A time that now seems so long ago and the values we had seem so far way...?</p>
<h2><u><strong>The Backstory</strong></u></h2>
<p>Every generation has that notion and in the world of reboots and remakes and come backs it's a trait that seems to have no plans of disappearing. But what if we didn't have to rely on nostalgia and fond memories? What if we took the good things from our childhood, our teen years. The friends, the films and shows that defined us and a generation and brought them back into the fray with the advancements we now have around us. </p>
<p>Well that's the melting pot of ideas that spawned the idea of ""Maitland '95"" for me! </p>
<p>There are fantastic things all around us at present but I couldn't help feeling that more often than not the values, morals and plain old family based adventure and mystery were missing from that which we grew up with and helped shape us. There's no denying the amazing advancements in technology we have nowadays but nothing beat a two player computer video game where your best friend was actually next to you or going out after school and having to ask a dozen parents if their kid could come out to play otherwise you had to wait on the step for them to finish their tea. </p>
<p>Well my Teen based Horror/ Adventure novel is very nearly finished and it's chocked full of call backs to the 90's, mystery, monsters, adventure. Taking inspirations from the shows and books from the day. All while keeping good ol' fashioned family values at it's core to hopefully inspire our kids and a new generation. </p>
<p>I never dreamed I could write a novel but here I am and with nearly 350 pages ready to print and with your help we can turn this idea into an actuality. With your backing I can self publish and print the manuscript for ""Maitland '95"" and help bring the best of the 90's into the 21st century</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2><strong><u>Bringing Maitland To Life</u></strong></h2>
<p>So how do we bring the book into the world? The research, Artwork, time spent making the progress so far and initial book awareness has been covered by myself but with the backing by yourselves we can fund the printing and copy-editing. Funding the means to release the novel and it's launch later this year.</p>
<p>Regular updates will be added as I finish the last few sections of the book and hit various milestones and announcements.</p>
<p>If we meet the target goal, we will be able to publish the first 1,000 copies and distribute on digital medium; all further contributions will allow us to print further batches and distribute to Libraries and Schools aswell. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><u><strong>Perks</strong></u></h2>
<p>There will be different ""perks"" for varying levels of contributions, this is a further way of me trying to display my sincere appreciation for believing in me and my work.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>In the past you have supported my music, helping me reach international success with my original music ""Going Global"". Now I'd love to be able to write and release something new you can treasure and give YOU back that feeling you had as a child, maybe a new favourite book for your own child or maybe you were older and enjoyed the classic horror shows and movies of the time and just want to reconnect with something that simply enthralled you. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2><u><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></u></h2>
<p>As with anything in life there are risks, HOWEVER just like the idea of bringing that warm fuzzy nostalgia feeling back to you with my work. I want you to feel safe and secure with your backing in this project.</p>
<p>All of the work has pretty much been done already and it has all been completed by myself alone, including artwork and promo and I will not be winding down anytime soon.</p>
<p>This campaign is purely to boost the project over that wall into a printed product that can be released to all of you lovely people.</p>
<p>Any shortfall on funding by the end of the deadline will result in smaller batches being run instead to honour all backers and then further work will be done by myself to make sure further prints can be released.</p>

<h2><strong><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></strong></h2>

<p>You can still get the word out and make some noise about the campaign, you can share the posts, links, anything helps spread the word and everything is valued greatly.  You can also follow Maitland on all major social media sites and apps such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter all of which make it easy to share and spread the Maitland Love at the literal click of a button. </p>

There will be different ""perks"" for varying levels of contributions, this is a further way of me trying to display my sincere appreciation for believing in me and my work.

In the past you have supported my music, helping me reach international success with my original music ""Going Global"". Now I'd love to be able to write and release something new you can treasure and give YOU back that feeling you had as a child, maybe a new favourite book for your own child or maybe you were older and enjoyed the classic horror shows and movies of the time and just want to reconnect with something that simply enthralled you. 
 

Risks & Challenges
As with anything in life there are risks, HOWEVER just like the idea of bringing that warm fuzzy nostalgia feeling back to you with my work. I want you to feel safe and secure with your backing in this project.
All of the work has pretty much been done already and it has all been completed by myself alone, including artwork and promo and I will not be winding down anytime soon.
This campaign is purely to boost the project over that wall into a printed product that can be released to all of you lovely people.
Any shortfall on funding by the end of the deadline will result in smaller batches being run instead to honour all backers and then further work will be done by myself to make sure further prints can be released.

 
Other Ways You Can Help
I know there are awesome people out there who want to help and even loose change makes a difference but I also appreciate that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help!
You can still get the word out and make some noise about the campaign, you can share the posts, links, anything helps spread the word and everything is valued greatly.  You can also follow Maitland on all major social media sites and apps such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter all of which make it easy to share and spread the Maitland Love at the literal click of a button.

<h2>Living Daily: Alexander Technique for Parkinson's Disease</h2>
<p>I have watched Alexander Technique make a visible difference to people with Parkinson’s Disease for over ten years now. In some cases, the improvements are extraordinary (<a href=""https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/parkinson-s-candace-cox-actor-edmonton-1.5083075"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here</a> to see CBC coverage of AT for PD!). When Alexander Technique students with PD visit their neurologists, they are routinely told: “you don’t look like you should”. Alexander Technique is not a cure, but it provides a way to preserve or recover the ability to function in normal daily living.</p>
<p>This book has been previewed, researched and discussed with people from across the spectrum of folks whose lives are touched by Parkinson’s Disease, from doctors and care-givers to other teachers and most importantly, with patients. It is a resource to help support their learning, and it is the product of 20 years of experimenting with how Alexander Technique can be adapted to make a difference for people with chronic illness.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555597583/arafrnyfcsyhj7pwyhyh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Study Poster from WPC 2013</i></p>
<p>I have taken small pilot projects on the efficacy of Alexander for Parkinson’s to the last two World Parkinson’s Congresses. With your help, I will be presenting this book at WPC2019 in Kyoto, Japan this June. We need a large-scale study to make Alexander Technique an option for all patients. This book can serve as a protocol to help make that research goal a reality. In it I have also chronicled some of the progress made by my students with Parkinson’s, some of which is clinically significant, and all of which is a source of hope. Presenting it in Japan, where I have been invited to be a featured author, will provide tremendous exposure to potential research partners.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Study Poster from WPC 2016</i></p>
<p>A further advantage of having a multi-media book is that we can use it as a postgraduate training tool for other Alexander teachers. Working with Parkinson’s can be a daunting thing, and this book is a culmination of decades of teaching and thousands of hours of one-on-one time working with students as they struggle to manage the disease. We need more trained teachers, and with this book we can offer them a standardized way of adapting Alexander for Parkinson’s, and give them a resource for support as they help students tackle the hugely varied array of symptoms.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>We need $9000 to get this book designed and accessible! We want it designed professionally so that it is easy to read and beautifully illustrated. It seems a small thing, but just having a book that is sturdy and lies flat when you open it almost doubles the print cost--I consider this an essential detail. Using only words to teach Alexander Technique is the difference between painting and sculpting. Therefore the book most have comprehensive photos and clear, simple sketches to help tell the story of your body. Your support will help me cover the costs of terrific photographers and a really talented, empathetic artist, as well as get the book laid out to the best possible advantage.</p>

<p>Further, I am delighted to be working with <a href=""https://brightwing.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bright Wing Media</a> in Vancouver on not just a physical book, but to develop an e-platform for folks who are comfortable reading on-line. Not only is this company ethical and talented, but they have also developed ground-breaking technology that will revolutionize the publishing industry. You can purchase <i>Living Daily</i> as an e-book and read it on any device, from your computer, tablet to even your smart phone, without any special apps. Amazing! Furthermore, they are able to embed short instructional videos throughout the text. Adding video will bring in that extra dimension of showing you what I am talking about; short of being able to reach through the screen and put my hands on you, it is the best way to teach and support that I know of.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have a student with Parkinson’s who has been studying Alexander Technique now since 2007. Although her disease has progressed over the past twelve years, she is still able to overcome intense tremor and stand up completely straight, then move “like a normal person,” as she puts it. Her ability to manage her disease is fairly unprecedented and everyone who meets her, including medical professionals, are amazed by her deliberate gait, strong voice, and her ability to stand up to her full height moments after she has been curled right up by her symptoms. She needs more lessons in order to offset her advancing illness. I am hoping that having the book to refer to during the months I do not see her will help, but more importantly, I want to use it to procure research to help us learn what the best “delivery” of Alexander Technique is for people like her. With research will come funding for patients to have access to lessons in the same way they are offered subsidies for medication and other modalities like physiotherapy.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555607877/m2krmtojvok0vtlqx1m4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And that is only the story of one student. Her progress, and that of a number of other PD patients I have been working with now for several years, shows us that consistent Alexander work seems to slow the onset of the disease, and provide a greater quality of life and certainly a greater functional ability in daily living. Most importantly, it gives hope.</p>

<p>Since 2016, I have had the privilege of working with a patient who was in the advanced stages of Parkinson’s; he could not roll over in bed on his own, get out of a chair on his own, walk or stand unassisted. After three years of working with him, as well as training his wife to use Alexander principles to work with him daily, he has regained all those skills, and shows no sign of stopping. His height has restored from 5’5” to the 6’ of his youth. Patients in advanced stages have fewer and fewer opportunities available to them, and are often told to resign themselves to immobility and worse. It is really important we get them this resource to start down a path of hope—and can move on to get the research to take this work farther.</p>

<h3>What is SISU? </h3>
<p>Derived from a Finnish concept and cultural construct, the word, “sisu,” means not momentary courage, but the ability to sustain that courage in the face of adversity--something that minorities have to do every day. Our zine is independently produced by a group of friends from the University of San Francisco who all share similar and overlapping experiences and backgrounds. As we express ourselves through this zine, we are letting you inside our cultures and identities in order to give representation to voices in the shadows of society.</p>
<h3>Why? </h3>
<p>As minorities, we do not always have the space to speak our minds, and oftentimes we cannot tell our own stories without them being twisted and reconstructed into ideas that do not truly represent us. Through our zine, SISU, we are making that space for ourselves and other creative minds.</p>
<p>Our aim is to share bits of who we are and what we love. We are the future of this nation and must be able to tell our own stories--Our loves. Our heartbreaks. Our growth. Our failures. Our breaking points. We will strive to demonstrate the true meaning of sisu by using our courage to dust ourselves off and overcome. We are standing up to speak what is on our minds, and in doing so we hope that we can inspire you to do the same.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All of us at SISU are college students and funds for all parts of production for the zine and merch come straight from our pockets! Funding a physical zine and merch is extremely expensive and you all can help us get some weight off our shoulders. Our goal of $2,00 will not cover all of our costs but it will for sure help us in a significant way. </p>

<p>My name is Roxana and I'm a self-taught visual designer. Having experienced a regular 9 to 5 existence for a decade, with much of my time in front of a screen, I decided to make a shift in my life. I got to middle management twice and gave that up in both cases. I figured that it was just not for me. I am too interested in the act of creation itself. And so, I recreated my life to start fulfilling my needs and, at the same time, to feel more connected to the people around me and to the communities to which I belong.</p>
<p>After several personal ""aha""s - that I'm very grateful for - this lifestyle shift was the basis of what has come to be the project you see now. The present campaign represents a conscious effort of gathering elements from my newly crafted existence and bringing them to life within the pages of this hardcover book.</p> <p>If you decide to back this project, it will be a decision that has three effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive an amazing piece of artwork</li>
<li>You will support an independent artist to help her transform her work into a sustainable way of making a living</li>
<li>You will donate 5% of your contribution to the children in the community of Tigman village, Palawan, Philippines</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://rockosanna.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/book3.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>To continue my story, after deciding that I needed a change, I challenged myself: I turned my world upside down and took off by myself to travel to South East Asia. I talked with my manager, took 2 months off and went to volunteer in a small village on the astonishing island of Palawan, in the Philippine Archipelago.</p>
<p>Arriving all by myself in Palawan, I had the feeling of landing on a totally different planet. It was, definitely the starkest cultural difference I have yet sensed. With multi-colored tuk-tuks, staring children and unidentifiable food market produce all around me, I stepped back into myself and got to observe, from an ‘alien’ perspective, the happenings in a world so far removed from my own. The Philippines is an amazing country. The natural beauty, the culture of the native tribes, the rural idyllic space, the tens of islands, and the underwater landscape, all present one aspect. However, on the other side of the curtain, there is tension created by the current political landscape, intense poverty with repercussions on culture and education, and a growing distance between the stunning touristic locales and the reality of life for the locals.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://rockosanna.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/philippines2.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I grabbed my pen as often as I got the chance, trying to somehow translate the reality of this place into a familiar language, to capture and store it into forever - a forever that can be shared with others as well. A gentle window into a reality that is as big as it is tiny. From cultural notes to crazy thoughts, from heart-stopping landscapes to mundane oddities or microscopical discoveries - everything went under my pen and got washed by my watercolors. Written in a freestyle manner, with absolutely no academic perspective to it, this book will reveal itself to you as a secret world, an intimate confession of what such a different reality has done to me as a human being. You will be driven by it in all possible emotional states - joy and pain, fear and lust.</p>

<p>When I thought of joining Indiegogo for bringing this project to life, I started researching what this meant. And one element that I liked most about the campaigns developed here is the transparency that the campaign authors offer about the way in which the funds will be used.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to create 100 books and set them free into the world. To you. The ones who will acquire them through contributing to the featured perk.</p>
<p>The other perks that I have created are meant to support the publishing of this batch of 100 books or more (if you request it, we print it!). You can either choose a contribution smaller in amount than the contribution for a book - or you can go for larger contributions. By choosing a larger contribution, you decide to support me in further creating such works in my current travel to South America and in other upcoming travels (together with my baby girl and my husband). You can follow our current journey and get in touch with us <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/rockosanna/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<li>campaign design materials</li>
<li>marketing and PR</li>
<li>social media promotion</li>
<li>research</li>

<li>book editing</li>
<li>the act of creating itself, the intellectual property defined by this final product that is the book</li>
<li>helping a young author publish her first book</li>
<li>Indiegogo taxes and payment processing fees</li>
<li>5% (from total raised, minus shipping) donation to the children in the community of Tigman village, Palawan</li>
</ul>
<p>Please keep in mind that this enumeration is just a short list of what the effort of bringing this project to life actually means. And, above all, I must emphasize the fact that printing a high-quality book is by no means a cheap thing to do. Also, it is very different from simply scrolling on a screen or reading it in black and white on a digital ink device. That would actually defeat the purpose of the full-color illustrations and the paper-feel of it all. Oh, and you just need to discover this world I’m talking to you about within this book - one that you can touch with your hands and feel with your eyes, mind, and heart. And all these things are beyond the material, even though they are shown to you in a paper-cardboard form.</p>
</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://rockosanna.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/technical1.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When you will hold the book in your hands, you will notice that, beyond the original drawings - that have been minimally fine-tuned in the digital medium - and beyond the text (which is  a mix of illustration side notes, journal writings, and post-travel edits &amp; add-ons), there’s also the visual identity of the product. Typography is an important part of it - so it is relevant to mention that the front cover typography is custom designed by me. Also, the text inside is mostly written in a handwriting font, custom-made to match my writing, especially for this book. The watercolor background of the cover was also created in analog form, with real watercolors. It was created at 4 am, on a night when I couldn’t sleep and sneaked out of bed, until baby Maya called me again. :)</p>
<p>As a personal note, during my pregnancy, I was intensely focused on preparing myself for birth and what that means. I have gradually discovered all sorts of taboos that our society sweeps under the carpet in relation to having a baby and giving birth. This is why I put the book project on hold and concentrated exclusively on my soon-to-be-mother experience. After baby Maya came to life, I have been working on the book on and off, dividing my attention between my human child and this intellectual offspring. I’ve done this with a lot of dedication.</p>

<p>The main purpose of this campaign is to get the book to you, directly to your personal library: no publishing house, no bookstore. You want it, we print it and ship it to you. As simple as that. Beyond the book, you can get perks such as a poem and artwork sent to your email, a big poster, a tote bag - you can also have an interview with me. Just go through the cute, illustrated perks below and check them out to the right side of this page, before you make your choice. Don't skip the bigger perks. Who knows, maybe you're a fan in disguise and are just finding that out now!</p>

<p>I know that we can achieve a much bigger goal together. All the perks that I have created are meant to take my creative process to another level. Every artist strives to find his or her style; A way of expressing and bringing value to the world in a unique manner, which enhances experience wherever it touches. I have found my creative spark in the mixed media form, combining illustration with writing, and sometimes also photography. The book you're about to get will show you this, and your support for me will help me to deliver it with impeccable quality. And I will continue to speak to you, my audience, in this unique language that I have discovered as a visual storyteller.</p>

<p>Sharing this book with you is an intimate, sensitive yet powerful confession of the world without, reflected within. It’s like a pair of glasses that I’m asking you to put on once - and maybe you’ll be inspired to wear them afterward too. This campaign is me keeping my promise to make it happen. I am so happy if I can have a book in my library, to read to Maya while she grows, for her to perceive it in all the phases - a book about a far, far away place, where she picked us and the world now. I know that my art will bring joy to your life - and that is a very serious topic. I also know that it will make you question things, it will make you look closer and choose not to pass by - and that is also a very serious topic.</p>
<p>And you know how they say that you need to pay it forward? Or that it would be nice to pay it forward? This I believe. I believe in giving back to the communities that have helped me grow and to the communities that have nurtured my curiosities. The way that I reached Tigman village was as a volunteered with an international volunteering organization. The program facilitates integrating into a local community and supporting them with your work, while also contributing financially to their needs - so the fee paid as a volunteer is also for the community. At the same time, you are guided by locals to comprehend their world, so you go beyond an isolated, touristic perspective of the place. The activities that I was involved in, during my stay there, were related to education and ecology.</p>
<p>I want to somehow provide further support to the children in Tigman village because a volunteer’s time is limited there. It involves a limited impact.  Summer school is a good tool for children in the area. By participating in these activities and interacting with the volunteers’ multiculturality, new horizons are being opened for and presented to them. But it can be a little bit more than that. So, I believe that the donations from this campaign will do that. The sum will be used to buy books and other educational materials for the children.</p>

<p>The Philippines is a wondrous country. The places that I have visited have left me with a longing to go back into the world and travel - and also with a longing to tell the story of my days spent there. It has left me with a desire revealed almost as a duty to pass on the tale of this place to you, my reader. I am here to share with you my thoughts, my inner states and all the nuances that bring us one step closer to our true core, to our real selves - unbroken by too many rules and conventions that one unintentionally follows when being born into this world.</p>
<p>This campaign represents a conscious effort to gather all of the above-mentioned elements in a hardcover book. A book that will reach travel aficionados, nomads, volunteer teachers, students, or people thinking about traveling and not knowing where to start their journey from. My book will act as an inspiration for you, the reader. You will find it amongst these pages - when you're looking for a magnificent moment of magic. You will also find a reminder of times spent together with people that I have met on this journey of transformation and who have now become my friends. You will perhaps feel it like a visit and a reconnection to some of your places seen and things done. This book will remind you of yourself.</p>

<p>With this first IndieGoGo campaign that I have created, I hope that you will help me bring this book to your coffee tables, your backpacks and your lives:</p>
<ul>
<li>The book is done! It is now in the final stages of proofreading by an English native speaker and editor. Currently, I am also working on a sequel.</li>
<li>The book will get to you depending on your location on the globe. Once I am back to Romania from my current travels, I will personally take care that the printing, finishing and delivery processes go smoothly and according to high-quality standards. You can check out the visual timeline below to see when this will happen.</li>
<li>You might need to be a little bit more patient if you are in Singapore or Australia, but the book will get to you. I also want to thank you very much in advance for the fact that you agree to pay the delivery fees - these are different in each country and are quite costly for me to manage. The printing and logistics expenses are enough to be taken care of on this side.</li>
<li>If you are from Romania but are living abroad and are coming home on a regular basis, take into consideration the option of having the book delivered to you at an address in the country. I will make sure you have it then and there. (Also, let me know if you want to meet in person, and then I'll return you also the delivery fee.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: the 20,000$ flexible goal is a personal choice of digits looking right on the screen. One should not be affected by this sum, as it is just a dreamy attempt to materialization. But dreams come true if you make them come true, right? Once you support my campaign, you will receive your perk, no matter if this goal is being achieved or not. So, power this project! As this project is power!</p>

<p>I am a 32 years old Romanian visual designer. I’ve been mostly working digitally in the past decade, in Cluj-Napoca, a beautiful town in the heart of Transylvania. I have a BA in Journalism and an MA in Advertising. I love traveling, people, animals, plants and rocks - almost everything natural found on this planet we call “home”, from sand grains to mountains. I have a dachshund dog called Frido who has been my unconditional companion - whether I’ve been in Romania or not. He is now with family, back home. I am a foodie and an amateur chef. Out of the local communities I am or have been involved in worth mentioning are the startup tech environment, the local <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/tedxcluj/?ref=br_rs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TEDx</a> community, the <a href=""https://ladieswinedesign.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ladies, Wine &amp; Design</a> community (I also founded, together with fellow creative ladies, the <a href=""https://ladieswinedesign.com/cluj/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cluj-Napoca</a> chapter), and local gatherings for UI and UX professionals (user experience and user interface designers). I have worked for both local and international customers as a professional designer, in a small creative boutique kind of scenery and also in a corporate environment, with colleagues from all over the world. I am sometimes a nomad by choice, trying to travel at least 3 months per year as a lifestyle. As a fun fact, I had my publishing debut in 2012, in a collective short stories volume, entitled “<a href=""http://www.humanitas.ro/humanitas/fic%C5%A3iuni-reale"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Real Fictions</a>”. I have been writing essays, editorials, poems before that and ever since - writing is a form of meditation for me, just like drawing.</p>
<p>Another fun fact is that I had free-hand-speed-drawn about 3 kindergarten walls, by working day and night, for an entire weekend. It was intense - I was seeing only butterflies and snails after that!</p>
<p>I am happy to say that I am and always have been a self-made (wo)man. After ticking off all sorts of considered-to-be achievements by the society we live in, I asked myself some questions. After some inner chatter, I went all by myself to volunteer at a kindergarten in South East Asia. There I have discovered a universe that got under my skin and into my bones. From culture and people to flora and fauna, terrestrial and aquatic - everything around me was new and so I have become a curious child all over again, absorbing everything with intensified perception -  sweet honey to my soul.</p>

<p>At the moment you can’t help with a financial donation? There are other ways in which you can support this project.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share my Indiegogo page and let your friends know about this book</li>
<li>Talk to your friends and share the news about my new project</li>
<li>Get creative - maybe you resonate so much with the campaign that you want to become a partner, or maybe you have a hostel in Lima or Montevideo. Or you just want to throw a party with a DJ set and some delicious muffins and talk to people about this. Go wild and crazy - I sure would enjoy any support you can offer!</li>
</ul> <p>Now, I am exploring South America - this time with my husband and my baby girl - writing this very piece of text from a small hostel in Salvador, Brazil. The sequel of the book is being documented already - as writing and drawing are a regular practice. I will leave technology behind, grab the pen, the watercolors, and my drawing notebook, and I will be back - the illustrated travel journals are coming to life and you're helping me achieve that!</p>

</div></div>","My name is Roxana and I'm a self-taught visual designer. Having experienced a regular 9 to 5 existence for a decade, with much of my time in front of a screen, I decided to make a shift in my life. I got to middle management twice and gave that up in both cases. I figured that it was just not for me. I am too interested in the act of creation itself. And so, I recreated my life to start fulfilling my needs and, at the same time, to feel more connected to the people around me and to the communities to which I belong.
After several personal ""aha""s - that I'm very grateful for - this lifestyle shift was the basis of what has come to be the project you see now. The present campaign represents a conscious effort of gathering elements from my newly crafted existence and bringing them to life within the pages of this hardcover book. If you decide to back this project, it will be a decision that has three effects:

You will receive an amazing piece of artwork
You will support an independent artist to help her transform her work into a sustainable way of making a living
You will donate 5% of your contribution to the children in the community of Tigman village, Palawan, Philippines


To continue my story, after deciding that I needed a change, I challenged myself: I turned my world upside down and took off by myself to travel to South East Asia. I talked with my manager, took 2 months off and went to volunteer in a small village on the astonishing island of Palawan, in the Philippine Archipelago.
Arriving all by myself in Palawan, I had the feeling of landing on a totally different planet. It was, definitely the starkest cultural difference I have yet sensed. With multi-colored tuk-tuks, staring children and unidentifiable food market produce all around me, I stepped back into myself and got to observe, from an ‘alien’ perspective, the happenings in a world so far removed from my own. The Philippines is an amazing country. The natural beauty, the culture of the native tribes, the rural idyllic space, the tens of islands, and the underwater landscape, all present one aspect. However, on the other side of the curtain, there is tension created by the current political landscape, intense poverty with repercussions on culture and education, and a growing distance between the stunning touristic locales and the reality of life for the locals.

I grabbed my pen as often as I got the chance, trying to somehow translate the reality of this place into a familiar language, to capture and store it into forever - a forever that can be shared with others as well. A gentle window into a reality that is as big as it is tiny. From cultural notes to crazy thoughts, from heart-stopping landscapes to mundane oddities or microscopical discoveries - everything went under my pen and got washed by my watercolors. Written in a freestyle manner, with absolutely no academic perspective to it, this book will reveal itself to you as a secret world, an intimate confession of what such a different reality has done to me as a human being. You will be driven by it in all possible emotional states - joy and pain, fear and lust.
 
 
 

When I thought of joining Indiegogo for bringing this project to life, I started researching what this meant. And one element that I liked most about the campaigns developed here is the transparency that the campaign authors offer about the way in which the funds will be used.
The goal of this project is to create 100 books and set them free into the world. To you. The ones who will acquire them through contributing to the featured perk.
The other perks that I have created are meant to support the publishing of this batch of 100 books or more (if you request it, we print it!). You can either choose a contribution smaller in amount than the contribution for a book - or you can go for larger contributions. By choosing a larger contribution, you decide to support me in further creating such works in my current travel to South America and in other upcoming travels (together with my baby girl and my husband). You can follow our current journey and get in touch with us here.


 
The money raised will be used to pay for:

the promotional video
campaign design materials
marketing and PR
social media promotion
research
logistics
book editing
the act of creating itself, the intellectual property defined by this final product that is the book
helping a young author publish her first book
Indiegogo taxes and payment processing fees
5% (from total raised, minus shipping) donation to the children in the community of Tigman village, Palawan

Please keep in mind that this enumeration is just a short list of what the effort of bringing this project to life actually means. And, above all, I must emphasize the fact that printing a high-quality book is by no means a cheap thing to do. Also, it is very different from simply scrolling on a screen or reading it in black and white on a digital ink device. That would actually defeat the purpose of the full-color illustrations and the paper-feel of it all. Oh, and you just need to discover this world I’m talking to you about within this book - one that you can touch with your hands and feel with your eyes, mind, and heart. And all these things are beyond the material, even though they are shown to you in a paper-cardboard form.


When you will hold the book in your hands, you will notice that, beyond the original drawings - that have been minimally fine-tuned in the digital medium - and beyond the text (which is  a mix of illustration side notes, journal writings, and post-travel edits & add-ons), there’s also the visual identity of the product. Typography is an important part of it - so it is relevant to mention that the front cover typography is custom designed by me. Also, the text inside is mostly written in a handwriting font, custom-made to match my writing, especially for this book. The watercolor background of the cover was also created in analog form, with real watercolors. It was created at 4 am, on a night when I couldn’t sleep and sneaked out of bed, until baby Maya called me again. :)
As a personal note, during my pregnancy, I was intensely focused on preparing myself for birth and what that means. I have gradually discovered all sorts of taboos that our society sweeps under the carpet in relation to having a baby and giving birth. This is why I put the book project on hold and concentrated exclusively on my soon-to-be-mother experience. After baby Maya came to life, I have been working on the book on and off, dividing my attention between my human child and this intellectual offspring. I’ve done this with a lot of dedication.

Sharing this book with you is an intimate, sensitive yet powerful confession of the world without, reflected within. It’s like a pair of glasses that I’m asking you to put on once - and maybe you’ll be inspired to wear them afterward too. This campaign is me keeping my promise to make it happen. I am so happy if I can have a book in my library, to read to Maya while she grows, for her to perceive it in all the phases - a book about a far, far away place, where she picked us and the world now. I know that my art will bring joy to your life - and that is a very serious topic. I also know that it will make you question things, it will make you look closer and choose not to pass by - and that is also a very serious topic.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>tl;dr — I have a PhD in Iranian linguistics. <br/><i>The Book of Esther Unmasked </i>uses the Book of Esther as an excuse to introduce Ancient Iranian culture, language and history.</b></p><p>Although I was born and raised in Israel and have no (known) genetic connection to Iran, I am fascinated with everything that has to do with Iran of the past 3000 years or so: people, language, society, culture and religion. I love Iran so much, I got a PhD in Iranian linguistics at 2005, supervised by Shaul Shaked, who is one of the greatest Iranists living today. Iranian linguistics means I can read Ahasuerus' original inscriptions, which I have.</p><p>Purim has always been an exciting holiday for me. The Book of Esther gives me an opportunity to talk about ancient Iran, and not only would people not frown — they would actually listen eagerly (and even pay for it)!</p><p>After 17 years of lectures, which developed tremendously over the years, I finally wrote my book last Purim. It was an intensive and exciting crowdfunding campaign on <a href=""http://www.headstart.co.il/project.aspx?id=13576"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Headstart</a>, the local platform for the Israeli market (its videos are in the gallery). The companions in this campaign chose the book's name, cover design, format, publisher's name and more.</p><h3>Introducing <b><a href=""http://www.zeresh.co.il/en/esther"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Book of Esther Unmasked</a></b>:</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441199540/orw8sbpumzrbuoonashw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 300px;height: 466px;""/></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>tl;dr — it's smart, fascinating and funny.</b></p><p>This is what 14-year-old Eyal Shahal wrote about my book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The story of the Book of Esther comprises an integral part of the Jewish DNA: every girl was Queen Esther at least once, and every boy was a king or Mordechai with a cotton beard. Isaac Manger put juicy Yiddish words in the mouths of these characters, but who knows what they actually talked like? The linguist Thamar E. Gindin knows. Her Book of Esther draws directly on the original ancient Mesopotamian, Persian and Greek sources, and that, ladies and gentlemen, is fascinating. Or as <span style=""font-style: normal;"">Chazal</span> put it: Did you know that the Jewish people took cultural ingredients from the gentiles and upgraded them to a flourishing and successful format which the gentiles are buying back?</p> <p>The Book of Esther is a cultural code that has to be deciphered. I laughed myself to tears in the part where Thamar explains the etymologies of the names of Haman's sons. One of them was handmade, and another one was destined to be a gynaecologist! Well, we don't always live to the interpretation of our names, and this happens in the best of languages. Even Old Persian.</p>
</blockquote>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>tl;dr — I want to adapt it to English in order to reach more people, <br/>and to Persian in order to alleviate misconceptions <br/>spread by the current regime.</b></p><p>As I said, <b>The Book of Esther Unmasked</b> is already out in Hebrew, and this project is about publishing English and Persian editions (as well as an expanded second edition in Hebrew).</p>
<p><b>Why English?</b> Because it's the <i>lingua franca</i> (common tongue) of the world today, and I want this knowledge to reach as many people as possible. My English readers will probably be adults, Jewish or of Iranian descent, but it's also suitable for brainy kids.</p>
<p>The English edition will be available both in print and e-book form, and as an audiobook.</p>
<p><b>Why Persian?</b> Because the Islamic regime in Iran, and its media agencies, tell the people horrible lies about the story of Esther. The audience in my lectures rolls on the floor laughing when I tell them about this, but it's actually quite scary. Someone must show them the original text and explain the real nature of the holiday. Besides, this is yet another opportunity to expose modern Iranians to ancient Iran.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441199010/jwmigr7hsoxfh9cowuhu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><span style=""font-size: 90%;"">I kid you not, this is the flag that was burnt in the demonstration against ""Esther and Mordechai the murderers"". The flag reads: ""Holocaust of 77000 Iranians"".</span></p>
<p>The Persian edition is planned as a free PDF, because it's a <i>mitzvah</i> to unconditionally reach as many Iranians as possible. And it would have to circulate freely anyway, even if I had planned to charge for it, because it will take time for the sanctions to be lifted — and right now, Iranians within Iran can't pay internationally or receive goods from abroad.</p>
<p>Because of the different objectives, and because of the different backgrounds I can assume for Hebrew, English and Persian speakers, the English and Persian editions of <b>The Book of Esther Unmasked</b> are actually adaptations, rather than translations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">***</p>
<p>It will be nice to be able to pay the rent and buy food while I write these adaptations. However, the initial sum of the campaign only covers the book's expenses: printing at least 1000 copies of the Hebrew and English editions, perks, Indiegogo fees, currency conversion commissions and so on. In most cases, shipping is also figured.</p>
<p>If we reach 150%, the audiobook will be seriously upgraded with five Purim <i>piyyutim</i> by <a href=""http://www.3kantoren.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-weight: bold;"">Die Drei Kantoren</a>, the amazing Berlin-based <i>Three Cantors</i> — <b>Ido Ben-Gal </b>(tenor), <b>Amnon Seelig</b> (baritone) and <b>Assaf Levitin</b> (bass) — with their home pianist <b>Naaman Wagner</b> and a string quartet. Check them out!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/HU8yvsxvN2o"" width=""420""></iframe></div>
<br/><span style=""font-size: 90%;"">Here they are singing songs relevant to the present time of year. <br/>I chose this video and not one with suits and <i>tallit</i> because Seelig's baby is not in them.<br/>The <i>piyyutim</i> for the audiobook will be studio-recorded.</span><p></p>
<p>If we reach more than that, the print edition will be upgraded, too, with more pages in colour. And there's more in store!</p>
<p>In addition to all of this, my partner Yuval — who does all the editing, proofreading, design and layout — and I would be grateful if we can also see some blessing in our hard work (and by ""blessing"" we mean the dirty P word). Judging by the amount of work we had invested in our previous Hebrew books, that's quite a lot of time and effort!</p><p>What if we don't reach our goal? We promise that al contributors will get their perks, but we can't promise a free PDF in Persian, and the printed editions may be only as large as the number of contributors.</p>

Since it's Flexible Funding, all the contriburots will get their perks, and some already have, in the Friday lecture in Israel and some of the T-shirts. The project will hit the road anyway with additional funds from other sources. And to those who wish to read what we wrote when we were young and optimistic:The story of Esther, an integral part of the Jewish DNA, is a cultural code to be deciphered. Who knows how the characters actually spoke? The Iranist Thamar E. Gindin knows. The Book of Esther Unmasked is a linguistic, cultural and historical exegesis on Book of Esther, a masterful blend of erudite scholarship and humor, drawing directly on the original ancient Mesopotamian, Persian and Greek sources. It shows how the Book of Esther reflects intimate knowledge of the culture and language of the time, and compares it to other stories and festivals in the ancient Near East and worldwide. Crowdfund it now!

 About us 


Thanks





tl;dr — I have a PhD in Iranian linguistics. The Book of Esther Unmasked uses the Book of Esther as an excuse to introduce Ancient Iranian culture, language and history.Although I was born and raised in Israel and have no (known) genetic connection to Iran, I am fascinated with everything that has to do with Iran of the past 3000 years or so: people, language, society, culture and religion. I love Iran so much, I got a PhD in Iranian linguistics at 2005, supervised by Shaul Shaked, who is one of the greatest Iranists living today. Iranian linguistics means I can read Ahasuerus' original inscriptions, which I have.Purim has always been an exciting holiday for me. The Book of Esther gives me an opportunity to talk about ancient Iran, and not only would people not frown — they would actually listen eagerly (and even pay for it)!After 17 years of lectures, which developed tremendously over the years, I finally wrote my book last Purim. It was an intensive and exciting crowdfunding campaign on Headstart, the local platform for the Israeli market (its videos are in the gallery). The companions in this campaign chose the book's name, cover design, format, publisher's name and more.Introducing The Book of Esther Unmasked:

tl;dr — it's smart, fascinating and funny.This is what 14-year-old Eyal Shahal wrote about my book:

The story of the Book of Esther comprises an integral part of the Jewish DNA: every girl was Queen Esther at least once, and every boy was a king or Mordechai with a cotton beard. Isaac Manger put juicy Yiddish words in the mouths of these characters, but who knows what they actually talked like? The linguist Thamar E. Gindin knows. Her Book of Esther draws directly on the original ancient Mesopotamian, Persian and Greek sources, and that, ladies and gentlemen, is fascinating. Or as Chazal put it: Did you know that the Jewish people took cultural ingredients from the gentiles and upgraded them to a flourishing and successful format which the gentiles are buying back? The Book of Esther is a cultural code that has to be deciphered. I laughed myself to tears in the part where Thamar explains the etymologies of the names of Haman's sons. One of them was handmade, and another one was destined to be a gynaecologist! Well, we don't always live to the interpretation of our names, and this happens in the best of languages. Even Old Persian.

You can find more testimonials in our video gallery, on our Facebook page, and if you're patient enough — in the campaign video.

tl;dr — I want to adapt it to English in order to reach more people, and to Persian in order to alleviate misconceptions spread by the current regime.As I said, The Book of Esther Unmasked is already out in Hebrew, and this project is about publishing English and Persian editions (as well as an expanded second edition in Hebrew).
Why English? Because it's the lingua franca (common tongue) of the world today, and I want this knowledge to reach as many people as possible. My English readers will probably be adults, Jewish or of Iranian descent, but it's also suitable for brainy kids.
The English edition will be available both in print and e-book form, and as an audiobook.
Why Persian? Because the Islamic regime in Iran, and its media agencies, tell the people horrible lies about the story of Esther. The audience in my lectures rolls on the floor laughing when I tell them about this, but it's actually quite scary. Someone must show them the original text and explain the real nature of the holiday. Besides, this is yet another opportunity to expose modern Iranians to ancient Iran.
I kid you not, this is the flag that was burnt in the demonstration against ""Esther and Mordechai the murderers"". The flag reads: ""Holocaust of 77000 Iranians"".
The Persian edition is planned as a free PDF, because it's a mitzvah to unconditionally reach as many Iranians as possible. And it would have to circulate freely anyway, even if I had planned to charge for it, because it will take time for the sanctions to be lifted — and right now, Iranians within Iran can't pay internationally or receive goods from abroad.
Because of the different objectives, and because of the different backgrounds I can assume for Hebrew, English and Persian speakers, the English and Persian editions of The Book of Esther Unmasked are actually adaptations, rather than translations.
***
It will be nice to be able to pay the rent and buy food while I write these adaptations. However, the initial sum of the campaign only covers the book's expenses: printing at least 1000 copies of the Hebrew and English editions, perks, Indiegogo fees, currency conversion commissions and so on. In most cases, shipping is also figured.
If we reach 150%, the audiobook will be seriously upgraded with five Purim piyyutim by Die Drei Kantoren, the amazing Berlin-based Three Cantors — Ido Ben-Gal (tenor), Amnon Seelig (baritone) and Assaf Levitin (bass) — with their home pianist Naaman Wagner and a string quartet. Check them out!

Here they are singing songs relevant to the present time of year. I chose this video and not one with suits and tallit because Seelig's baby is not in them.The piyyutim for the audiobook will be studio-recorded.
If we reach more than that, the print edition will be upgraded, too, with more pages in colour. And there's more in store!
In addition to all of this, my partner Yuval — who does all the editing, proofreading, design and layout — and I would be grateful if we can also see some blessing in our hard work (and by ""blessing"" we mean the dirty P word). Judging by the amount of work we had invested in our previous Hebrew books, that's quite a lot of time and effort!What if we don't reach our goal? We promise that al contributors will get their perks, but we can't promise a free PDF in Persian, and the printed editions may be only as large as the number of contributors.

The perks
tl;dr — books, lectures, T shirts, ""mini me""s and acknowledgmentsFirst and foremost — after all, this is why we're here: books!

In Persian: print and digital (e-book) copies of The Book of Esther Unmasked. The e-book will be distributed free of charge, but you are the ones who make it happen!

All books come complete with matching bookmarks.

In addition,


Dedications: you may request a personal dedication from the author. When buying in bulk, you can insert your own dedication to your guests, employees or congregation members, printed inside the book or on a sticker, depending on quantity.

LecturesI lecture in English, Hebrew and Persian. 
Private lectures: I have a variety of lectures and will be happy to advise you (via Skype) on the one suitable for the occasion and audience. Please contact me directly to check my availability before choosing private lecture perks; if you contact me after paying, you'll have to settle for the dates I have available. Lectures in person are limited to countries it's safe for me to travel to (unfortunately, Iran is not one of them).


Local perk for Hebrew-speaking Israelis: on October 13th and 16th, I will give live lectures about women and current affairs in Iran. The lectures will take place at the beautiful studio of Chef Erez Stern. 


Similar lectures abroad will be announced as part of new goals we set, hopefully, as campaign goals are met and passed.
On three Sundays in January, I will give online lectures on the Book of Esther, each week in a different language: January 10th — Hebrew; January 17th — English; January 24th — Persian. The lectures will start at 9PM Israel time, which is evening in Europe and South Africa, night in Iran, and morning/noon in the US and Canada (sorry, Australians!). During the live lecture, you can post questions and comments in the chat, and I will answer or refer to them (almost) right away. For whoever chooses to connect after the lecture, I will post short videos with answers to later questions from time to time.


T-Shirts
T-shirts with your name in Old Persian cuneiform, handmade by my artist daughter Anati. Because they're handmade, you may choose either ""Your Name"" (like this T-shirt) or your actual name, in your choice of colours. You can also ask for a script or language other than Old Persian cuneiform. If it's a real language, we promise to find out how to write your name! If we can't find it, we might write something like ""Net weight: 200g"".You may mix and match perks simply by adding up the values of all the perks you want and writing your full request in the comments. Well, except the local lectures and the collectors' copies of the limited Hebrew edition of The Book of Esther Unmasked, which are, as the name indicates, limited...
Karma and thank you
The real perk (that is, until the book is ready) is knowing you helped the knowledge reach as many people as possible, but we will also thank all contributors in a personal e-mail and on a daily ""thank you"" post on Facebook, tagging the ones we find. If you wish not to be thanked publicly, please let us know in a personal message right after contributing. If you write it in the contribution comments, we may not see it on time!
Please note: if you choose to make a higher contribution but don't write what you want in the comments, we'll just assume you're being generous and don't want anything besides the perk chosen.
A note about shipping: unless otherwise stated, the perks include regular postage to Israel, Europe (including the UK), the US and Canada. We will contact you after the campaign to see if you want other shipping options (by EcoPost, DHL, Fedex etc.), or in any case of shipment elsewhere on the globe.

The Peace Pagoda Restoration and Retreat Center Improvement Project


Part 1: The Pagoda Restoration




 
The Open Path, a Center for Eastern and Western Studies, Inc, founded in 1976 is a non-profit community dedicated to the unfoldment of consciousness through meditation, the study of philosophy and the performance of charitable works. 
Idaho's first and only Buddhist Peace Pagoda urgently needs restoration to continue its compassionate benefits for the present and for future generations.  The proposed work includes restoration of the pagoda as well as building a protective winter covering to prevent future damage.The pagoda is approximately 10 miles from Boise in the Boise Front on a five acre parcel of wooded  land owned by the Open Path.
                       Peace Pagoda in 2016

                  
                                      Peace Pagoda 2016 The Universal Peace Pagoda is a symbol and agent of transformation.  The form itself shows the path of personal liberation, beginning with the grounding of being and the creation of inner peace.  The upper shape symbolizes the channeling of personal aspiration and how to transform that into compassionate activity that benefits all sentient beings.  In addition, its structure and composition helps to channel and magnify positive energies through the skillful application of its form and relics to aid beings in their unfoldment.                         Peace Pagoda 1982

                   Building the Pagoda 1982

Inside the Pagoda's inner core lies precious relics of enlightened beings and sacred metal etchings of holy Buddhist scriptures. 

To see the entire  Pagoda building process slide show from 1982 go to 
our photo gallery on the top of the page or click on the link to our  Picassa slide show .
The Pagoda was built in 1982 by Open Path members under the direction of the Venerable Sayadaw U Thila Wunta, the abbot of Dat Pon Zon Monastery in Burma.  The Venerable Sayadaw was a master builder of pagodas around the world, and the Universal Peace Pagoda was his gift of ""enlightened form to Western students"".

The Sayadaw supervising the construction of the Universal Peace Pagoda in 1982.
Now that The Venerable Sayadaw U Thila Wunta has passed, the Open Path will work with key members of the original construction team to restore the Pagoda in harmony with the designs and methods of its initial creation, to maintain the continuity of its physical and spiritual expression.The Pagoda sits on three beautiful acres in the mountains near Boise, owned by The Open Path. 
Part 2: Beyond the Pagoda: The Retreat Center Improvement Project
The second part of our project is much needed.


There is a partially constructed retreat center on the land.  Any additional $$ raised above the Pagoda Restoration Project goal will go towards siding, windows, doors for the retreat building as well as a detached privy.  Also, extra funds will be used for ongoing pagoda maintenance. 


 The pagoda land site also needs a privy --- just a simple one stall vault
 toilet. What more can we say, ""When you got to go, you got to go!"" 

 Not our actual design - but you get the idea!

<p>At a transitional age when many children start to let go of a magical world-view and their imaginations become hobbled with the restrictions of reality, young Lily inadvertently finds herself on the adventure of a lifetime after she is literally swept into the ocean. The transitional process is represented in the story by Lily’s being forced to move from an idyllic life in a ‘cottage by the sea’ to ‘the city’ which represents all that is grown-up and non-magical. Yet, thanks to Lily’s adventure on the night before her family’s departure, she will carry with her an unshakeable belief and connection to the fairy-tale world where anything is possible and where mermaids really do exist. The story also carries a message about the pride and arrogance of people who do not heed the warnings of the natural world, and a lesson that true faith can work miracles.</p>
<p>The setting for the story is the undersea realm of King Neptune. The title Neptune’s Tale refers to Neptune’s explanation to Lily of where mermaids come from, and his story of the demise of Atlantis.</p>
<p>Neptune’s Tale is aimed at ages 3 through 6 - 7 and is intended as an illustrated storybook, with illustrations by Artist Leith Ridley-Combe according to the style the author envisaged.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p> <ul> <li>We need funding to have this book published as a hardcover book with colour illustrations. To make it viable we'd need to order 100 copies from a print-on-demand publisher, and for this we need around $1000  - the equivalent of R10 000 in South Africa, where the author resides and where we will have it published and printed.</li> <li>We are offering  a signed printed hard-cover copy of a beautiful children's book, with an acknowledgement in the acknowledgement page to each contributor - but this will cost quite a bit, so we can only offer it to those who contribute $50 - it's a lot I know. This is not a cheap book to print.</li> <li>Though this story  is intrinsically about the innocence of childhood, faith and the belief in magic, it is also set in the sea, and based on a love of the ocean. It is written by  someone fortunate enough to live in a place (Plettenberg Bay in South Africa) where you can hear the song of humpback whales echoing around the bay in the still early hours. If we (and by we I mean myself and my sister who is an artist, and who did the illustrations for me) do not achieve our funding target, the collected funds will go to Sea Shephard - the 'pirates' who have dedicated their lives to the welfare  and future of whales and dolphins...and the ocean....so that others may hear the eerie sounds of humpbacks long into the future.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I wrote this story for my own daughter when she was three years old, and I think that it’s worth something; worth enough to go public and ask for help from people out there who might really enjoy it.</p>
<p>The people I’m looking for are those who have children aged 2 to 7, or who have family and friends with children aged 2 to 7. People with open minds - who embrace magic, wonder, faeries and other silly things, people who believe in God or Gaia and all other wondrous possibilities, who love the ocean, animals, innocence, children and adventure; people who remember their childhoods, when they believed in the Tooth Fairy and the Easter Bunny…and their parents didn’t feel guilty for letting them do so. People who believe a seagull might talk and a dolphin might rescue a child from a wild sea, sea monsters might eat stricken sailors, mermaids might exist…and everything that might be is still mighty real in the mind of a child.</p>
<p>I thought of publishing this as an e-book, but it didn’t feel right. I might still (one has to keep with the times), but what I really envision and want is exactly why I am looking for crowd-funding – the expensive option: A hardcover book with colour illustrations that a child can read (or their parent read to them) while they are holding it, running their hands over the illustrations, the book on their lap as they lie under a cosy divan in their warm, safe bedroom. Then mommy, or daddy, leaves the room, switches off the night-light, says goodnight…and they drift off to sleep…to swim with the dolphins, visit whales, meet fish and fairies and makes necklaces of bubbles under the sea.</p>
<p>In the morning, they wake with their heads, hearts and souls filled with adventure – the kind of magical wonder and possibility we tend to forget as adults. The book is on the nightstand, or maybe it has fallen to the floor – to be picked up again, to be kept, to be read again or kept on a bookshelf or a box in the attic for their own children to read one day.</p>

I've had some success with the stories of Kim Soon-ae (Mariam Johari) and Karja Wiredja, and I've presented my account to a major conference in Chicago last March. But more work needs to be done.</span></p>
<p>Here is what I know so far: </p>
<p>In 2007, Kim Soon-ae was an 86-year old woman living in Seoul, Korea. In 1943, she was Mariam Johari, a 22 year-old Malay single mother with three small children living in Plentong, a small town in Johor just across the strait from Singapore.  In May 1943, Japanese soldiers abducted her. They forced her to work building an airfield. In the labor camp, Kim met a Korean soldier in the Imperial Japanese Army. They fell in love, and after the war ended, she ended up with him in South Korea without papers. For more than 60 years Kim was stranded and almost entirely invisible. Her three children in Malaya presumed her dead.  Then, chance intervened. Her story became public and she was able to see her children, now old and gray themselves, again before she died. </p>
<p>Yet, Kim Soon-ae turns out to be just one of perhaps 1,000 women from Southeast Asia in relationships with soldiers in the Imperial Japanese Army, some of them with children, who were shipped off with their partners after Japan surrendered. The fates of these women and their children and have vanished from our consciousness. This project throws long overdue light on Kim and the other women and their children who ended up far from home, stateless and unseen because of their relationships with imperial Japanese army personnel. </p>
<p>In 2011 a Japanese charity in Bangkok discovered Karja Wiredja living in rags in a remote community near Thailand's border with Myanmar. 65 years earlier he had been taken away from his home in Indonesia to work on the notorious Thai-Burma railroad. When Japan's empire in Asia collapsed in 1945, Karja was left stranded, impoverished and stateless in Thailand. The Japanese charity returned Karja to his small hometown in central Java but it was too late: his family had vanished and people could barely understand his way of speaking the local language. Karja is just one of hundreds of thousands of men from Southeast Asia who were taken far from home, forced to work on Japan's imperial projects, and never returned after the war ended. This project seeks these vanished men in Borneo, the Andaman Islands, and in northern Thailand, and brings their lives and their stories into the light at last.</p>
<p>Nothing tells us more about the long term, ongoing effects of Japan's empire and occupations in Asia than the unseen lives of the ordinary people the empire moved, used, ruined, and then left stateless and washed up on some foreign shore. Women like Kim Soon-ae and men like Karja Wiredja deserve to have their stories brought into the light, to have them told, to have their lives remembered and recorded. Your support of <b>part 2 alive</b><i style=""font-weight: bold;""> </i> <b>the undead empire</b><b style=""font-style: italic;""> </b>helps to redress the injustice of silence. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Needs, tasks, and rewards</h3> <p>Join me in completion of the research and writing for this part of the much larger project <b>: the undead empire | reports from Japan's colonies in Asia</b>, a mixed travel/memoir/academic book visiting and exploring the long-term effects of Japan's empire and occupations.

<p>$5,000 ($2,500 for airfares and other travel costs; $2,500 for 14 days of living expenses) supports travel to London and Amsterdam and research in the UK National Archives and the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation where records of displacement and repatriation of women and men like Kim Soon-ae and Karja Wiredja are kept. </p>
<p>$3,000 ($1,600 for airfare; $1,400 for living costs) supports travel to Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India, and field research with Dr. Rashida Iqbal, Curator of the National Memorial Cellular Gaol in Port Blair. The aim of the work here is to track the fates of 600-1,000 Malay and Javanese slave laborers for the empire who were not repatriated to their homelands.</p>
<p>$2,000 ($1,000 for airfares; $1,000 toward daily expenses) supports meetings and interviews in the Philippines and Taiwan with the children and grandchildren of Japanese and Taiwanese soldiers in the Imperial Japanese Army who had children with Filipinas and with women in Singapore, Malaya and Indonesia.</p>

</div></div>","Lives and stories I'm Vivian Blaxell, professor of Japanese and Asian Studies, researcher, writer, and contributing editor for the Asia Pacific Journal: Japan Focus. In the nearly 40 years I've been teaching, speaking and writing about Japan's empire and occupations in Asia I've come across some horrific things, but nothing haunts me more than the untold stories of men and women from South East Asia displaced and ruined by the empire, shipped far from home, and stranded for the rest of their lives without anybody knowing about it. For years I've been trying to track these tragic stories down and bring them into the light. I've had some success with the stories of Kim Soon-ae (Mariam Johari) and Karja Wiredja, and I've presented my account to a major conference in Chicago last March. But more work needs to be done.
Here is what I know so far: 
In 2007, Kim Soon-ae was an 86-year old woman living in Seoul, Korea. In 1943, she was Mariam Johari, a 22 year-old Malay single mother with three small children living in Plentong, a small town in Johor just across the strait from Singapore.  In May 1943, Japanese soldiers abducted her. They forced her to work building an airfield. In the labor camp, Kim met a Korean soldier in the Imperial Japanese Army. They fell in love, and after the war ended, she ended up with him in South Korea without papers. For more than 60 years Kim was stranded and almost entirely invisible. Her three children in Malaya presumed her dead.  Then, chance intervened. Her story became public and she was able to see her children, now old and gray themselves, again before she died. 
Yet, Kim Soon-ae turns out to be just one of perhaps 1,000 women from Southeast Asia in relationships with soldiers in the Imperial Japanese Army, some of them with children, who were shipped off with their partners after Japan surrendered. The fates of these women and their children and have vanished from our consciousness. This project throws long overdue light on Kim and the other women and their children who ended up far from home, stateless and unseen because of their relationships with imperial Japanese army personnel. 
In 2011 a Japanese charity in Bangkok discovered Karja Wiredja living in rags in a remote community near Thailand's border with Myanmar. 65 years earlier he had been taken away from his home in Indonesia to work on the notorious Thai-Burma railroad. When Japan's empire in Asia collapsed in 1945, Karja was left stranded, impoverished and stateless in Thailand. The Japanese charity returned Karja to his small hometown in central Java but it was too late: his family had vanished and people could barely understand his way of speaking the local language. Karja is just one of hundreds of thousands of men from Southeast Asia who were taken far from home, forced to work on Japan's imperial projects, and never returned after the war ended. This project seeks these vanished men in Borneo, the Andaman Islands, and in northern Thailand, and brings their lives and their stories into the light at last.
Nothing tells us more about the long term, ongoing effects of Japan's empire and occupations in Asia than the unseen lives of the ordinary people the empire moved, used, ruined, and then left stateless and washed up on some foreign shore. Women like Kim Soon-ae and men like Karja Wiredja deserve to have their stories brought into the light, to have them told, to have their lives remembered and recorded. Your support of part 2 alive  the undead empire helps to redress the injustice of silence. 
   Needs, tasks, and rewards Join me in completion of the research and writing for this part of the much larger project : the undead empire | reports from Japan's colonies in Asia, a mixed travel/memoir/academic book visiting and exploring the long-term effects of Japan's empire and occupations. To learn more about :the undead empire, visit www.undeadempire.com. 
$5,000 ($2,500 for airfares and other travel costs; $2,500 for 14 days of living expenses) supports travel to London and Amsterdam and research in the UK National Archives and the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation where records of displacement and repatriation of women and men like Kim Soon-ae and Karja Wiredja are kept. 
$3,000 ($1,600 for airfare; $1,400 for living costs) supports travel to Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India, and field research with Dr. Rashida Iqbal, Curator of the National Memorial Cellular Gaol in Port Blair. The aim of the work here is to track the fates of 600-1,000 Malay and Javanese slave laborers for the empire who were not repatriated to their homelands.
$2,000 ($1,000 for airfares; $1,000 toward daily expenses) supports meetings and interviews in the Philippines and Taiwan with the children and grandchildren of Japanese and Taiwanese soldiers in the Imperial Japanese Army who had children with Filipinas and with women in Singapore, Malaya and Indonesia.
$500 to cover fundraising costs.
Rewards for your support include special :undead empire bookmarks and postcard collections created using vintage Japanese postcards from the time, digital and/or hard copies of :the undead empire | reports from Japan's colonies in Asia book when it is published in 2017, and prominent recognition of your support in both versions of the book. Most importantly, your contribution to the alive stage of the project carries with it the reward of knowing you have helped shine light on a tragic and yet mostly unknown part of the recent past. 
This is a flexible funding campaign. If the campaign does not reach the entire goal of AUD$10,500, any campaign funds will be used to support research in London and Amsterdam first, then in Port Blair, and lastly in the Philippines and Taiwan.
Rest assured, the project will be completed no matter what the outcome of this campaign.

</h3><div><h3>Thank you all for the support! </h3></div><div><br/></div>Until
recently, Canada’s government took care of the Canadian veterans who defended
our values of freedom and democracy. 

<p>But with Stephen Harper and the
Conservatives in power, our heroes stand alone. </p>
<p><b>You see,
the Conservatives turned their backs on our veterans. </b></p>
<p>The Harper
Conservatives argued in court they have “no moral obligation to our veterans” who
they sent into war zones.</p>
<p>The Conservatives
spent $750,000 of taxpayers’ money to fight the legal rights of soldiers to get
proper compensation for their injuries.</p>
<p>I’m sure you
agree with us that our vets deserve dignity. 
They deserve respect. You already know that many vets came home injured.  Wounded. And yet the Conservatives closed
nine frontline offices that helped these brave men and women.</p>
<p><b>What we will do</b></p>
<p>We are
running a national campaign to encourage voters to defeat the
Conservatives.  </p>
<p>We are
organizing veteran volunteers and supporters in communities across Canada. We
will use Facebook, our website and our large contact list to mobilize on the
anti-Conservative vote on Election Day. 
And we will be in the media regularly – challenging the Conservatives.</p>
<p><b>Why your donation is so important </b></p>
<p>Our
digital presence will be extensive.  In
one week of testing we reached more than two million people!  A $100 donation will get a support-our-veterans

<p>This
issue resonates with voters. Our Facebook posts have spread like wildfire.</p>

</div></div>","Victims of Bullying Need Help and Healing Victims of bullying in middle school and/or high school often enter college or the workforce with unresolved anger, depression and low self-esteem from the abuse they suffered.  Names Will Never Hurt Me: Healing for Victims of Bullying, will help young adults who were victimized find hope and healing. 



Names Will Never Hurt Me: Healing for Victims of Bullying will help victims by:

1.  Validating their pain.
2.  Illustrating how the psychological damage from the trauma can
sabotage their career and relationships if not dealt with.
3.  Help
them find healing from the trauma and provide a road map to create the life they
desire.
My story will be introduced in the first chapter.  I was the victim of bullying for nearly 10 years beginning in third grade through my senior year in high school.  As a young adult, I was angry, bitter and struggled with low self-esteem and bouts of depression.  
It took another ten years after leaving the bullying behind for me to find healing and develop a better foundation for dealing with life.  Now, I want to help other victims.

Help publish this book and reach out to these victims. The
next steps include editing, layout, printing, marketing and publicity.
The
ultimate goal isn't just selling books. 
My goal is to speak at high schools, colleges and community groups.  I will bring attention to the long-term
damage that bullying causes, and help other victims with their issues. My story
will be used to show them that there is hope for a better future. I’ll listen
to their struggles and help them begin the healing process.
The total I am seeking is $6600, which will go to:  Developmental editing - $800 Copy editing - $400
ISBN numbers - $250

Professional Reviews - $450
Website design - $500

Printing 1000 copies and shipping - $2200

Marketing & Publicity - $2000

Perks Offered
There are three levels of perks offered to those who help get this book published.  Those who donate:

$25 - electronic copy of the book $50 - electronic copy and a signed print copy of the book
$100 - both of the above perks, plus a three week online seminar designed to help you get beyond obstacles from the past and create the life you desire.

I need approximately $4000 to get the book published and print 1000 copies.  The remainder of the funds I'm seeking will allow me to hire people to help with marketing and publicity.  If I reach the smaller goal, I can still publish the book and seek alternative methods to market the book.
I've Been Where These Victims Are: My experience as a victim, and a person who overcame the trauma make me uniquely qualified to help other victims.  I learned better ways to deal with the past, and how to create a  better future.   Challenges  Getting a book noticed with so many titles being published every year can be a difficult task.  Bullying is currently a very hot topic in the media and in schools around the country.  Right now, there aren't a lot of books written to help the victims after they leave the bullying behind.  I will fill a niche that is currently wide open.
I also have contacts at several local universities and in local media outlets  These contacts will allow me to get speaking opportunities, and help me get interviews at local TV stations and radio stations.

Since November 2013 my designs and research on Persian women clothing from Elam (3200 B.C) to Pahlavi dynasty (1979) have been the subject of a Dutch filmmaker's documentary ""Unraveled"". We are aiming to have it ready for the (IDFA) international documentary film festival Amsterdam and other film festivals  (2015).
My ultimate goal is to share my costumes,
knowledge & insights to a bigger audience to make the richness of our
Persian culture more tangible and visible. I hope you are willing to support me
in this goal and to make it our joined effort.


    Risks & Challenges
To ensure quality and transparency, I have asked a writer/editor friend of mine, Beth Hooper of Tower of Babel Communications and Publications (www.tobcp.com), who also has publishing experience to assist with editing and publishing. We have found a highly-skilled and qualified graphic designer, Kjeld de Ruyter of Puntspatie bv (www.puntspatie.nl), to assist with layout and publishing. Thanks to his skill and contacts, we are able to publish at a high level of quality worthy of the research, but yet in a cost effective manner. We are willing to share the estimates with you upon request.

<p><b></b></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><b>Who am I?</b>
<p>I’m graduated in French literature from the University of Sofia. Working for two decades as French translator and radio journalist, I always wrote <span>albeit</span><span> sporadically, but I understood the
difficulty of the craft and the need to improve my skills. So I enrolled in
four on-line courses in creative writing at </span>Barnes &amp; Noble, I’ve read some books and started to implement
what I have learned in my writing, experimenting in
different genres. Gradually, I realized that my passion turned imperceptibly in a vocation I was
taking seriously.</p>
<p>Afterwards I started
uploading my short stories in my blog in Bulgarian language and the response from the Bulgarian readers
was great. Some
of my stories were published in four collections: <i>To Defeat Your Destiny</i>, <i>The Lucky Guy</i>, <i>The Dream Of Ouroboros</i>, <i>And Rome Remained Free</i>. Meantime I met other Bulgarian writers. One of them is Iva Kassabova and
together we created the novel <i>Let Be
Adventure</i>. The novel was published in 2013, we had a great launch party and
a book tour in Bulgaria and it was well received by the readers and attracted
the media attention. Now I have more than
eighty short stories, I’m finishing my second novel and
I’m working on the idea of a third.</p>
<p><b>Why I need your support?</b></p>
<p>I would like to
present my stories to a wider audience, to
see how I’m doing at a worldly level, but that being Bulgarian,
I write in my native language. I know what it means to really master a language and I know my English
is not on the required literary level. So, to do things
professionally, I have to hire a professional Bulgarian to
English translator to give you the opportunity to get acquainted with my stories, a
proofreader, a cover designer and a website designer. I managed to hire a
translator for three of them that you can read through the links below, but for
the rest I need your support.<i><a href=""http://philipdanchev.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-free-will.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><br/></a></i></p><p><i><a href=""http://philipdanchev.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-free-will.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Free Will</a></i></p><p><i><a href=""http://philipdanchev.blogspot.com/2015/04/zama.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Zama</a></i></p><p><i><a href=""http://philipdanchev.blogspot.com/2015/04/the-lucky-guy.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Lucky Guy</a></i><br/></p><br/><p><b>Why should you support me?</b></p>
<p>Bulgaria is an old country, there were many different
cultures and unknown legends – I based my novel on one of them. In the mean
time this is a modern country with ancient roots and, despite the difficulties
of today, successfully mixes past and present. That’s exactly I do in my
writing, although I don’t write only for or about Bulgarians. Even if some of
my characters come from different places and different times, the stories I
write are comprehensible for anyone no matter where they are from and where
they are living. In the meantime I lean on that mix between past and present I
mentioned above and I have what to say with my work.</p>
<p><b>How I’ll use the collected amount</b></p>
<p>As I mentioned above, to do the things professionally I have to hire a
professional translator, a proofreader, a cover designer and website designer.
I will manage to hire the cover designer and the proofreader myself but to
translate my best short stories with approximately length of 90 000 words I
need $ 9 900. I secured $ 1 000 for the website designer but I lack another $ 1
500, in total $ 11 400. If the campaign succeeds partially, I intend to
create a website and to hire the translator and the proofreader for the corresponding
amount of short stories. If the campaign exceeds the desired amount, I’ll be
able to hire them for my novel too, gathering the rest by myself.</p>

<p>Завършил съм френска филология в СУ „Св. Климент Охридски”. От две десетилетия
работя като преводач и радио журналист и винаги съм писал, макар и спорадично,
но разбрах трудността на занаята и необходимостта да усъвършенствам уменията
си. Затова изкарах четири онлайн курса по творческо писане към <span>„</span>Barnes &amp; Noble”,
прочетох някои книги по темата и започнах да прилагам наученото в писането си и
да експериментирам в различни жанрове. Постепенно осъзнах, че тази моя страст
незабелязано се е превърнала в призвание, към което подхождах сериозно.</p>
<p>След време започнах да публикувам разказите си
в първия си блог на български и реакцията на читателите беше много добра. Някои
от тях бяха издадени в четири сборника: ""Да победиш съдбата си"", ""Щастливецът"", ""Сънят на Уробороса"" и ""И Рим остана свободен"". Междувременно се запознах с други
български писатели. Един от тях беше Ива Касабова, с която заедно създадохме
първия си роман „Да бъде приключение”. Романът беше издаден през 2013 г.,
имахме чудесна премиера и турне, романът бе добре приет от читателите и
предизвика вниманието на медиите. В момента имам над осемдесет разказа и

сметка, че английският ми не е на нужното литературно ниво. Затова, за да мога
да направя нещата професионално, трябва да наема професионален преводач от

three years later. Sigurlina’s potential outstrips her control
making her a danger to herself and others. She is now the only
survivor of her line charged by her ancestors with avenging them
against the crusader assassins infesting the north lands.</p>
<p><b>Audun </b>Bear Friend: drawn to study and
adventure and born into a sea faring family Audun studied as a
navigator form childhood and took up the study of the Runes becoming
a Galdr in his mid teens.  He longs to see all of Midgard and holds
that faith is personal and that you must judge others by their
actions not their words. He had no enemies until crusaders attacked
his ship and slaughter his crew. Now he is sworn to vengeance and
will use all his power both as a man and a Galdr to end the
crusader’s tyranny.</p>
<p><b>Ragna</b>, born the daughter of a Karl who
sided with Aethelstan in his invasion of Wessex. In her youth she
learned Latin, as well as several other languages. When she was nine
the crusaders executed her father for preaching religious tolerance.
She was made a thrall in her own home. Taken in a Viking raid she
served in Karl Geldnir Oar Snapper’s hall where her skills with
languages earned her a place in Geldnir’s confidence and later
heart. When Geldnir’s beloved wife died Ragna took to his bed, but
more importantly to his heart giving him something to live for. When
Geldnir died Ragna was freed and sent off to Finnmark. Ragna wants a
luxuriant life, sees men as play things and meal tickets, but is
fiercely loyal to those who show her kindness and regard. If there is
an angle you can rest assured that Ragna is working it. She distrusts
almost everyone at first and hates crusaders for their hypocrisy and
greed.</p>
<p><b>Vidurr</b>: Ulfhednar, wolf warrior, raised
by his pack to be as comfortable on four legs as two. An expert
hunter and trapper. He was a husband, father, loyal son and follower
of Surt until the crusaders burnt his village, slaughtered his kin
and left his father crippled to suffer the straw death. Vidurr has
nothing more to lose and has sworn revenge against the crusader scum
that killed his pack. If he must, he will align himself with the Aesir followers,
because the crusaders are the greater threat.</p>
<p><b>Kjorn</b>: Sworn bondsman to Fjorn Kjorn is
loyal to a fault. A competent, though unimaginative, seaman who has
seen more of Midgard than most dare dream exists. Fond of a horn of
mead and a good meal he is also a stalwart fighter and a
semi-reformed scoundrel. Crusaders have stolen the peace of the
island or Orkney where he intended to wait out his years in relative
comfort. Now he is called to action again for love and loyalty and a
chance at a good death.</p>

</div></div>","Horn of the Kraken
 
We at Pendelhaven publishing are very happy to announce our second Fate of the Norns novel: Horn of the Kraken. We are both excited and eagerly looking forward to publishing a line of novels that expand and decorate the mythic tapestry of the Fate of the Norns Viking universe.


The sun and moon
have been devoured by the cosmic wolves casting the world into
Fimbulwinter. Men prey on each other to survive. Into this world
comes a war of brothers.
During
the sword age of Ragnarok, the Viking apocalypse, a group of heroes
must steal the Horn of the Kraken from Hakon, the bastard pretender
to the throne of Norveig. This mighty and magical artifact summons a terror from the deep, and the current target is the longship fleet of Jarl Erik Bloodaxe!
Can a karl’s son unite a band of champions and face a threat that endangers the future of Midgard? 
The Norns have decreed that he is to lead a Seith witch, who is
plagued by ghosts, a near giant Galdr, with the power of the Runes, a Maiden of Ratatosk, mischief shield maiden who may be more
trouble than she’s worth, and an Ulfhednar, wolf warrior and master hunter.
Follow this fellowship as they embark on an epic adventure filled with danger, political intrigue, love, monsters, alliances and betrayals.




Story & Characters
 

The tale unfolds in western Midgard. Hakon has allied himself with the Christian King Aethelstan in order to overthrow the eldest of the late King Harald's sons- Erik Bloodaxe.
Fjorn son of Geldnir, Karl of Orkney
desires nothing more than to pursue his studies as a skald in peace
and defend Orkney from the forces of Hakon, bastard pretender to the
thrown of Norveig. Everything changes when Fjorn learns that the man
he calls father is not his sire. Now his blood ties him to a lineage
encompassing Jarls and the gods; forcing him to become a hero and choose between half
brothers.
The warband includes:
Sigurlina was born of a line of powerful
seithkona; she was shocked into her powers at age twelve when
she witnessed crusaders murdering her mother and destroying her
village. Her Grandmother trained her until the old woman’s death
three years later. Sigurlina’s potential outstrips her control
making her a danger to herself and others. She is now the only
survivor of her line charged by her ancestors with avenging them
against the crusader assassins infesting the north lands.
Audun Bear Friend: drawn to study and
adventure and born into a sea faring family Audun studied as a
navigator form childhood and took up the study of the Runes becoming

actions not their words. He had no enemies until crusaders attacked
his ship and slaughter his crew. Now he is sworn to vengeance and
will use all his power both as a man and a Galdr to end the
crusader’s tyranny.

fiercely loyal to those who show her kindness and regard. If there is
an angle you can rest assured that Ragna is working it. She distrusts
almost everyone at first and hates crusaders for their hypocrisy and

because the crusaders are the greater threat.

<h3>
<i>The Bias Magazine</i> - A Project of the Institute for Christian Socialism</h3>
<p>** Thanks to donations to our first <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/institute-for-christian-socialism"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IndieGoGo campaign</a>, we were able to raise <strong>$1,810 </strong>for our writers and website needs. We're grateful for your support! We're now attempting to raise a second round of funds. **</p>
<p><i>The Bias Magazine</i> is the inaugural project of the Institute for Christian Socialism and the premier voice of the Left in American Christianity. Cutting across the routine conventions of the Church and religious academy, we are the distinctive radical and ecumenical voice on politics, culture, economy, and environment. Your funding supports the production and labor costs for print and digital editions of <i>The Bias</i>. The print edition publishes twice a year, with digital content appearing regularly every week. </p>
<p>We need to fundraise $5,000 to sustain and build the work we've begun. Can you consider a gift to help us grow this year?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why <i>The Bias</i>? Why Now?</h3>
<p><i>The Bias</i> is designed to respond to the absence in the religious publishing landscape of a distinctive leftwing and socialist voice. <i>The Bias</i> will give voice to the conviction that the Christian Church and its theology cannot be accurately understood in our time apart from its material conditions. The absence of any significant representation of the political Left within the Church, academy, or religious and theological media only exacerbates these conditions. <i>The Bias</i> will speak to the intersection of church life and Left politics, better represent the church within the politics of the Left, and help nurture new social formations, within the church and society at large</p>
<p>Readers of <i>First Things, Sojourners</i>, and <i>Christianity Today</i> will find a unique voice and perspective presented in our pages, and will stand as a Christian iteration of publications like<i> Jacobin, Catalyst, Dissent</i>, and <i>New Left Review</i>, while remaining distinct enough in its format from these other programs to offer consistent brand and market differentiation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What can I expect to find in <i>The Bias?</i>
</h3>
<p><i>The Bias</i> will begin as a digital publication. We have begun planning to grow into a print magazine while continuing to generate quality digital content. <i>The Bias</i> will explore issues of politics, culture, economy, and environment from an ecumenical and radical perspective. Each published issue will present a guiding theme. For example, one issue may focus on “Race,” “The Left and Religion,” “Climate Change,” or “Labor.” While each of these themes is responsive to contemporary news cycles, the editorial voice and presentation will approach them in an “evergreen” fashion, so that every issue will be fresh and relevant for many months after initial release. This same relevance will also be sustained by the regular content posted to the magazine’s website every week.</p>
<p>The magazine format will allow for the publication of a number of notable voices from across the fields of contemporary theology, ethics, textual study, and religious history. Every piece published will emphasize fine writing and original, unconventional analysis of the intersection of Christianity with contemporary social, political, and cultural life. The reader can expect certain types of regular commentary, but both the print and online formats will allow for a great deal of flexibility in terms of themes, topics, and outlook. Cultural commentary, film and music criticism, and human-interest pieces will also be regular features of the magazine.</p>
<p>The production cycle for our print magazine will be seasonal, with new writing appearing each week online. Essays and commentary will be curated and solicited by editors overseeing topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Politics</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Environment and ecology</li>
<li>Anti-racist and feminist movements and theory</li>
<li>The Religious Right</li>
<li>Political theology</li>
<li>History of Christian socialism</li>
<li>Film, art, and literature</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What does my donation help with?</h3>
<p>In order to make <i>The Bias</i> a reality, we need your support to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase technology and website tools to support the digital presence of <i>The Bias</i>
</li>
<li>Compensate writers and editors for their quality work</li>
<li>Expand our artistic capacities by compensating radical artists</li>
</ul>
<p>For this funding cycle, we need to fundraise $5,000 to sustain our initial work. If you would like to make a large gift and/or would like to explore partnership as a publisher, seminary, denominational organization, or religiously-focused philanthropy, we welcome the opportunity. Please email us at contact@christiansocialism.com.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The impact of your donation</h3>
<p>Your contribution now makes a difference. You are helping us to establish a firm foundation for<i>The Bias</i> and to develop additional material manifestations of the vision of God’s new creation: a society marked by the interdependent health of our common earthly home, the shared enjoyment of our common wealth, and the just participation of all in our common social and political life together.   </p>
<p><i>The Bias</i> is just the start. Our Solidarity Projects and Convivia are emerging even now. The vision has its time. It will not delay.   </p>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>Every gift counts from $5 to $50 to $500.</p>
<p>If you can't donate today, it doesn't mean you can't help in other ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out about our fundraising campaign by sharing with your networks</li>
<li>Help connect us with organizers, ministers, theologians, and other workers at the intersection of Christianity and left politics</li>
<li>If you are interested in working with ICS, <i>The Bias</i>, and especially if you'd like to write for us, please send an email with ""Contributor"" in the subject line to editor@christiansocialism.com</li>
</ul>

Cutting across the routine conventions of the Church and religious academy, we are the distinctive radical and ecumenical voice on politics, culture, economy, and environment. Your funding supports the production and labor costs for print and digital editions of The Bias. The print edition publishes twice a year, with digital content appearing regularly every week. 
We need to fundraise $5,000 to sustain and build the work we've begun. Can you consider a gift to help us grow this year?

Why The Bias? Why Now?
The Bias is designed to respond to the absence in the religious publishing landscape of a distinctive leftwing and socialist voice. The Bias will give voice to the conviction that the Christian Church and its theology cannot be accurately understood in our time apart from its material conditions. The absence of any significant representation of the political Left within the Church, academy, or religious and theological media only exacerbates these conditions. The Bias will speak to the intersection of church life and Left politics, better represent the church within the politics of the Left, and help nurture new social formations, within the church and society at large
Readers of First Things, Sojourners, and Christianity Today will find a unique voice and perspective presented in our pages, and will stand as a Christian iteration of publications like Jacobin, Catalyst, Dissent, and New Left Review, while remaining distinct enough in its format from these other programs to offer consistent brand and market differentiation.

What can I expect to find in The Bias?

The Bias will begin as a digital publication. We have begun planning to grow into a print magazine while continuing to generate quality digital content. The Bias will explore issues of politics, culture, economy, and environment from an ecumenical and radical perspective. Each published issue will present a guiding theme. For example, one issue may focus on “Race,” “The Left and Religion,” “Climate Change,” or “Labor.” While each of these themes is responsive to contemporary news cycles, the editorial voice and presentation will approach them in an “evergreen” fashion, so that every issue will be fresh and relevant for many months after initial release. This same relevance will also be sustained by the regular content posted to the magazine’s website every week.
The magazine format will allow for the publication of a number of notable voices from across the fields of contemporary theology, ethics, textual study, and religious history. Every piece published will emphasize fine writing and original, unconventional analysis of the intersection of Christianity with contemporary social, political, and cultural life. The reader can expect certain types of regular commentary, but both the print and online formats will allow for a great deal of flexibility in terms of themes, topics, and outlook. Cultural commentary, film and music criticism, and human-interest pieces will also be regular features of the magazine.
The production cycle for our print magazine will be seasonal, with new writing appearing each week online. Essays and commentary will be curated and solicited by editors overseeing topics such as:

Politics
Economics
Environment and ecology
Anti-racist and feminist movements and theory
The Religious Right
Political theology
History of Christian socialism
Film, art, and literature


What does my donation help with?
In order to make The Bias a reality, we need your support to:

Purchase technology and website tools to support the digital presence of The Bias

Compensate writers and editors for their quality work
Expand our artistic capacities by compensating radical artists

For this funding cycle, we need to fundraise $5,000 to sustain our initial work. If you would like to make a large gift and/or would like to explore partnership as a publisher, seminary, denominational organization, or religiously-focused philanthropy, we welcome the opportunity. Please email us at contact@christiansocialism.com.

The Bias is just the start. Our Solidarity Projects and Convivia are emerging even now. The vision has its time. It will not delay.

<p>The book was created by a group of multidisciplinary designers to act as exhaustive reference material for biomimetic design. By breaking down a variety of natural examples by form, pattern/texture, and color, the handbook puts all the nature-based form inspiration you need at your very fingertips. Created to help designers and artists across multiple disciplines, the book painstakingly documents a variety of plants and animals, creating an easy-to-access database of their forms, patterns, and dominant colors. These examples could save you hours of research on Wikipedia or Pinterest (or any other place you go for research) by simply giving you a sort of Yellow-Pages of organic design. </p>

<p>The Book is subjective to the context of its use. To say, if you're</p>
<p>A <strong>product designer</strong>, you may use the forms and textures of the Starfish in creating a grip texture on your products. Or Shape for various products design.</p>
<p>A<strong> graphic designer</strong>, you may find the color schemes and the textures useful in producing good illustrations and compositions.</p>
<p>An <strong>automotive designer</strong>, you may use the attributes to find the power curves for your next automobile sketch.</p>
<p>A <strong>textile designer</strong>, you may find the naturally coupled color theme and the symmetrical forms of the Starfish to tessellate and create a spread.</p>
<p>a <strong>UI/ UX designer,</strong> you can use the color themes to contextually generate a more realistic web experience.</p>
<p>An <strong>Engineer/ a Modeler</strong>, you can feed your creative end by converting the 3D textures into meshwork and derive stress and strength parameters.</p>
<p>A<strong> Student</strong>, You can use for your science projects to various artwork project.</p>
<p>It simply makes your process of inspiration hunt easier. The aforementioned users are from our limited source of knowledge. The uniqueness of this product lies in the fact that it is one, but many at the same time. The reader can manifest his/ her/ their own meaning into it.</p>

""This visual reference book for designers includes hundreds of forms, patterns, and colors extracted from natural things like fruits, veggies, insects, fish, and more, providing a new source of creative inspiration...""-The Awesomer 



The Nature of Form won The Design Intelligence Award (DIA) 2020, and  got placed in DIA TOP 100 list.
Designed to do for nature-inspired design what the Pantone Shade Card did for colors, the Nature of Form handbook captures and carefully documents as many as 1454 forms, patterns, and colors, all pulled from flora and fauna.

 
The book was created by a group of multidisciplinary designers to act as exhaustive reference material for biomimetic design. By breaking down a variety of natural examples by form, pattern/texture, and color, the handbook puts all the nature-based form inspiration you need at your very fingertips. Created to help designers and artists across multiple disciplines, the book painstakingly documents a variety of plants and animals, creating an easy-to-access database of their forms, patterns, and dominant colors. These examples could save you hours of research on Wikipedia or Pinterest (or any other place you go for research) by simply giving you a sort of Yellow-Pages of organic design. 

 

 
The book’s multiple examples come with images, forms, silhouettes, color values and palettes, and even physical attributes that help spark the imagination and get those creative juices flowing. Whether you’re an industrial or transportation designer looking for aesthetic cues, or a graphic designer looking for patterns, logo inspiration, or even color palettes, the Nature of Form puts a veritable encyclopedia of nature-inspired design in the palm of your hand.

 
“Nature of Form for Designers” is a self-published design book co-created by UDLAB and distributed by Fablab Innovation, USA. Designed to be a go-to reference book, Nature of Form makes it easy to conceptualize, detail, and design effective and aesthetic products by tapping into the world’s largest design database… Nature itself


 
This book features an exclusive original collection of Forms, Textures & Colors, derived from Nature. The forms are classified into characteristic attributes as well. We reckon nifty use of this data in the fields of Product Design, Graphic Design, Textile Design, Fashion Design, Transportation Design, Animation, Artistry, other Creative disciplines, & certainly, by an Inquisitive Individual.


 
We are building a system that looks at form development from a new perspective. This product is one of its kind, inception never seen or heard of before. It's indigenous, it's disruptive and moreover, the best part is it powers the originality within a person. This product is one, but many at the same time. It makes you wonder. Each reader can manifest their own meaning into it, giving us the possibility of numerous derivatives from one single book.  We bring to you an avant-garde subject, the ‘Nature of Form’, and the assets we fabricated with much diligence.
Inside the Book: A collection of extractions of Organic Elements from Nature into Forms, Textures, and Colors. Total: 1454 Entities, 432 forms + 231 Patterns +791 colors
 



On top of our Nature of Form design theme, for every design book we sell, we will plant a tree through One Tree Planted, a nonprofit organization dedicated to the reforestation of our planet!

A graphic designer, you may find the color schemes and the textures useful in producing good illustrations and compositions.
An automotive designer, you may use the attributes to find the power curves for your next automobile sketch.
A textile designer, you may find the naturally coupled color theme and the symmetrical forms of the Starfish to tessellate and create a spread.
a UI/ UX designer, you can use the color themes to contextually generate a more realistic web experience.
An Engineer/ a Modeler, you can feed your creative end by converting the 3D textures into meshwork and derive stress and strength parameters.
A Student, You can use for your science projects to various artwork project.
It simply makes your process of inspiration hunt easier. The aforementioned users are from our limited source of knowledge. The uniqueness of this product lies in the fact that it is one, but many at the same time. The reader can manifest his/ her/ their own meaning into it.

 






Since its genesis, we have devoted around 3780 hours into making Nature of Form what you see today as a finished(pilot) product.
In the full length of 325 days, there were around 250 thousand strokes drawn.
Around 2,200 selective forms were digitized out of the many that were manually drawn.
The conclusion/ upshot of all that rigorous exercise was the achievement of  432 forms, 231 Patterns, and 791 colors.
We further comprehended all the forms between 9 attributes, by linking a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 attributes to each form.

The cards will guide you regardless.</p>
<ul>
<li>52 beautiful collage-style cards that work together to offer wisdom and guidance for life and its various challenges.</li>
<li>Independently produced by the deck’s creator.  This deck will not be sold on Amazon.</li>
<li>3” x 5” Premium 300gsm cardstock with smooth finish.</li>
<li>Sturdy 2-piece box if we reach the goal of 500+ decks.</li>
<li><strong>Made in the U.S.A.</strong></li>

<h3>The Energy of the Wisdom of the Serpent</h3>
<ul>
<li>Snakes often elicit fear but they are truly wondrous beings from whom we can learn a great deal about transformation and shedding what no longer serves us just as serpents shed their skin so they can grow and evolve. </li>
<li>The serpents chosen for this deck are those whose characteristics, behaviors, and mythologies present a window into our own lives.  By looking within and recognizing how the serpents’ wisdom can assist us we, too, can grow and evolve by shedding what no longer serves us in our lives.</li>
<li>The collage colors chosen to accompany each serpent symbolize emotions and intuition evoked by the serpent, its colors, and its characteristics.</li>
<li>Serpent wisdom can assist us with our own spiritual journeys, both within and in the world, and can help with shadow work, spiritual enlightenment, and being of service to others.  Most important, serpent wisdom can facilitate loving ourselves and our own unique characteristics, quirks, and idiosyncracies.</li>

<h3>What I Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to birth this deck into reality:</p>
<ul>
<li>$17,500 funding will pay for copyright, licensing, and use of the serpent images, printing costs for the cards that include hard-copy proofs, two-piece boxes, printing of the guidebook, shipping costs, and labor. </li>
<li>There are two individual perks--a signed 8x11 professional quality print of the King Cobra card signed by the creator and a 30-minute face-to-face individual reading using the deck--as well as a perk that combines the two.</li>
<li>If we don’t reach the goal, decks will still be printed, however we will not get the two-piece boxes because a minimum order of 500 is required for that.  Funding will still pay for the use of the images, the decks, and the guidebooks.  Two-piece boxes will be substituted with tuck-boxes (like what a typical deck of playing cards comes in), which can be included regardless of the number of decks funded.</li>

The Energy of the Wisdom of the Serpent

Snakes often elicit fear but they are truly wondrous beings from whom we can learn a great deal about transformation and shedding what no longer serves us just as serpents shed their skin so they can grow and evolve. 
The serpents chosen for this deck are those whose characteristics, behaviors, and mythologies present a window into our own lives.  By looking within and recognizing how the serpents’ wisdom can assist us we, too, can grow and evolve by shedding what no longer serves us in our lives.
The collage colors chosen to accompany each serpent symbolize emotions and intuition evoked by the serpent, its colors, and its characteristics.
Serpent wisdom can assist us with our own spiritual journeys, both within and in the world, and can help with shadow work, spiritual enlightenment, and being of service to others.  Most important, serpent wisdom can facilitate loving ourselves and our own unique characteristics, quirks, and idiosyncracies.



What I Need and What You Get
In order to birth this deck into reality:

$17,500 funding will pay for copyright, licensing, and use of the serpent images, printing costs for the cards that include hard-copy proofs, two-piece boxes, printing of the guidebook, shipping costs, and labor. 
There are two individual perks--a signed 8x11 professional quality print of the King Cobra card signed by the creator and a 30-minute face-to-face individual reading using the deck--as well as a perk that combines the two.

My dream is to be of service to others live a life they love living and one way I can do that is by creating this deck to help guide them on their path.",4.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>About the Story</h3>
<p>Not so long ago, I knew the path my life would take. Housewife. Mother. A noble calling, yet predictable, ordinary.</p>
<p>Then out of nowhere came a strange proposal...innocent...intriguing. Abruptly, my course was altered, whisking me from the security I'd always known to a new town, another life far from home. As I struggled to hold to my end of the agreement, I didn't see that all I loved was slowly crumbling.</p>
<p><i>Wings in the Storm</i> is the true story of mistakes realized too late, of everything lost, of the fight to get it back, and of rebuilding a life far different from before. It delves deep into frailties and vulnerabilities, yet it’s peppered with touching moments, valued friendships, humorous stories, and glimpses at the everyday beauty that surrounds us. From dark beginning to uplifting ending, it explores the defeats, victories, scars, healing, and richness that have come from my walk through brokenness.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why It Matters</h3>
<p>Yet, at the core of the book are struggles not unique to me. People everywhere have gone through hardships that set them spinning and changed their lives forever.</p>

<h3>About the Author &amp; the Book </h3>

<p>I'm Sandra Grace, author of <i>Wings in the Storm</i>.</p>
<p>In my early elementary school years, I dreaded creative writing assignments. I just didn’t get it. One day, my third-grade teacher asked us to write a story about a time machine—we could step back into the past or race ahead to the future. The idea intrigued me. Creativity sparked to life, and my pencil flew across the page. My pre-historic adventure surprised my teacher, and her encouragements that day started my life-long love of writing.</p>
<p><i>Wings in the Storm</i> is my first creative non-fiction book. It started over seven years ago with a bus ride that forever changed my life. In those beginning days, alone and determined, I knew something big was coming. I wanted to write the story. I just didn’t know what the story was yet.</p>
<p>So I kept journals and letters to record one event after another. Life happened, and piece by piece, my story came together, rich and colourful; and it begged to be written. When I finally sat down at the keyboard, it all spilled out as I relived it.</p>
<p>For a year, this book was my full-time job, and I’m excited about the finished product.</p>
<p>Experience it for yourself. I hope you enjoy reading <i>Wings in the Storm</i> as much as I enjoyed writing it for you.</p>

</div></div>","About the Story
Not so long ago, I knew the path my life would take. Housewife. Mother. A noble calling, yet predictable, ordinary.
Then out of nowhere came a strange proposal...innocent...intriguing. Abruptly, my course was altered, whisking me from the security I'd always known to a new town, another life far from home. As I struggled to hold to my end of the agreement, I didn't see that all I loved was slowly crumbling.
Wings in the Storm is the true story of mistakes realized too late, of everything lost, of the fight to get it back, and of rebuilding a life far different from before. It delves deep into frailties and vulnerabilities, yet it’s peppered with touching moments, valued friendships, humorous stories, and glimpses at the everyday beauty that surrounds us. From dark beginning to uplifting ending, it explores the defeats, victories, scars, healing, and richness that have come from my walk through brokenness.
 
Why It Matters
Yet, at the core of the book are struggles not unique to me. People everywhere have gone through hardships that set them spinning and changed their lives forever.
Early Wings in the Storm readers say they were captivated by the story and refreshed by its raw honesty about doubts and questions they, too, faced. More importantly, they found strength and encouragement in the truths reflected throughout its chapters.
This book is for anyone who’s endured heartache or loss. For anyone who knows someone who’s hurting. For anyone who enjoys a real-life story that’s sure to entertain, uplift, and challenge.
Come with me on the adventure. Chances are, you’ll find yourself somewhere in the pages of Wings in the Storm.

About the Author & the Book 

I'm Sandra Grace, author of Wings in the Storm.
In my early elementary school years, I dreaded creative writing assignments. I just didn’t get it. One day, my third-grade teacher asked us to write a story about a time machine—we could step back into the past or race ahead to the future. The idea intrigued me. Creativity sparked to life, and my pencil flew across the page. My pre-historic adventure surprised my teacher, and her encouragements that day started my life-long love of writing.
Wings in the Storm is my first creative non-fiction book. It started over seven years ago with a bus ride that forever changed my life. In those beginning days, alone and determined, I knew something big was coming. I wanted to write the story. I just didn’t know what the story was yet.
So I kept journals and letters to record one event after another. Life happened, and piece by piece, my story came together, rich and colourful; and it begged to be written. When I finally sat down at the keyboard, it all spilled out as I relived it.
For a year, this book was my full-time job, and I’m excited about the finished product.
Experience it for yourself. I hope you enjoy reading Wings in the Storm as much as I enjoyed writing it for you.

<p><strong>Warum das Buch</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bergregionen</strong> stehen heute vor mehreren Herausforderungen, z.B. fehlenden wirtschaftlichen Perspektiven, Einwohnerschwund und Klimawandel. Als Kind in Amerika war ich von den Bergen fasziniert und besitze seit 25 Jahren eine Zweitwohnung in den Alpen. Ich identifiziere mich sehr stark mit ihnen und will die Region beim <strong>Meistern der Herausforderungen</strong> unterstützen. </p>
<p>Das Buch bietet viele originelle Lösungen für meine geliebten Bergregionen, um sich in der rasch wandelnden Wirtschaft und der dynamischen Gesellschaft zu behaupten. Plakativ ausgedrückt, <strong>der Antrieb zum schonenden Wachstum liegt nicht „auf dem Berg“ sondern „im Tal“</strong>; beispielsweise: </p>
<ul>
<li>Aufbau von sogenannten <strong>MICE-Anlässen</strong> – Meetings, Incentives, Conferences und Exhibitions – für Geschäftskunden gefördert durch innovative <strong>Digitallösungen</strong>, welche die Abläufe der B2B-Kundschaft erheblich erleichtern und die Erlebnisse bereichern; </li>
<li>Gruppierung von nahliegenden Ferienorten in einem <strong>Regionalverbund</strong>, die dadurch erfolgte Ressourcenteilung  würde Kosten senken und durch die Weiterentwicklung der Alleinstellungsmerkmale jedes Dorfes die Attraktivität des diversifizierten, jedoch vereinten Verbundes und somit die Umsätze gesteigert werden;</li>
<li>Aufbau von Arbeits- und Wohnplätzen, welche durch die <strong>Verschmelzung der Grenzen zwischen Arbeits-, Frei- und Ferienzeit</strong> die Menschen anziehen.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft allgemein stehen vor gewaltigen Herausforderungen. Die im Buch geschilderte neue Art von Wirtschaften ist eine <strong>wichtige Antwort zu vielen verbreiteten Herausforderungen heute.</strong> Zur Illustration davon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alle bekennen sich zur Nachhaltigkeit, während die Weisse Arena Gruppe den Weg in die Zukunft mit einem <strong>Stretch Target</strong> zeigt: der erste <strong>selbstversorgende Ferienort</strong> in den Alpen zu werden. Dafür steht einen umfassenden 7-Punkte-Plan. Dass Nachhaltigkeit und die damit verbundene Förderung der Biodiversität zentral zum Firmenverständnis sind, wird durch die Verleihung einer Markenname – Greenstyle – als Kennzeichnung für sämtliche solche Aktivitäten unterstrichen. Gleichzeitig ist die Marke ein klares Signal, dass <strong>Nachhaltigkeit und Biodiversität zentral zum Marktauftritt</strong> des Unternehmens sind;   </li>
<li>Ein einfaches und bekanntes Beispiel, welches selten mit der notwendigen Konsequenz wie bei der Weissen Arena Gruppe umgesetzt wird: Das Beziehen von Rohmaterialien und Nahrungsmitteln aus der Gegend senkt nicht nur die Transportemissionen, sondern fördert auch die lokale Wirtschaft, intensiviert das regionale Bergerlebnis für die Berggäste und stimuliert Innovationen im Bau oder Lebensmittel, welche auch ausserhalb der Bergregion einer Nachfrage dienen könnten – also, eine <strong>Wertsteigerung für mehrere Communities.</strong>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have been a dancer my whole life. I love to move, breathe, and enjoy everything God gave us. When trauma hit me, I thought I would never dance again. I slowly lost my function; I could not walk without pain. In this slow decline, the inner sense of, ""I will never be able to do the things I love again (tennis, dancing, and snow skiing)"" hit me and depression set in. I am here to tell you that you can regain function, heal old injuries, overcome fear, and go back to the things that you love. I did it. Somatics works. The healing is real and gives you a sense of hope. This book gives you the tools that you need to begin the healing process. Let the beautiful Somatic movements unwind the deep, hidden, and tight muscles. As you begin to unwind, you will have a sense of hope and freedom that you have not felt since you were younger!</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My goals for the greater impact of this book are:</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li>To be used as a guide for individuals to navigate their personal healing </li>
<li>To give insight to those who are suffering about what’s needed for holistic transformation to happen in the body</li>
<li>To take part in the healing of humanity – making way for joy, peace, and wellness for everyone</li>
<li><p>To be used as a recipe for the health of your own personal body, nervous system and brain, and for spiritual encouragement</p></li>
<li><p>To be used as a resource for trainers, therapist, chiropractors, caregivers and  psychologist to share the healing movements with clients</p></li>
<li><p>To be used by groups who have suffered trauma to begin the divine healing movements together</p></li>
<li><p>To be part of the larger movement of healing the cry for help in every heart <br/><br/>The heart of a person<br/>The heart of the city<br/>The heart of a nation</p></li>
<li><p>To be of service to the healing of humanity, leading the way to true freedom, peace, joy, health and wholeness.<br/><br/>Freedom from anxiety<br/>Freedom from fear<br/>Freedom from trauma<br/><br/>2 Peter 1:3<br/><br/>God's Divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through the full knowledge of the One who called us by his own glory and excellence.</p></li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
I have been a dancer my whole life. I love to move, breathe, and enjoy everything God gave us. When trauma hit me, I thought I would never dance again. I slowly lost my function; I could not walk without pain. In this slow decline, the inner sense of, ""I will never be able to do the things I love again (tennis, dancing, and snow skiing)"" hit me and depression set in. I am here to tell you that you can regain function, heal old injuries, overcome fear, and go back to the things that you love. I did it. Somatics works. The healing is real and gives you a sense of hope. This book gives you the tools that you need to begin the healing process. Let the beautiful Somatic movements unwind the deep, hidden, and tight muscles. As you begin to unwind, you will have a sense of hope and freedom that you have not felt since you were younger!
 

The Impact
My goals for the greater impact of this book are:



To be used as a guide for individuals to navigate their personal healing 
To give insight to those who are suffering about what’s needed for holistic transformation to happen in the body
To take part in the healing of humanity – making way for joy, peace, and wellness for everyone
To be used as a recipe for the health of your own personal body, nervous system and brain, and for spiritual encouragement
To be used as a resource for trainers, therapist, chiropractors, caregivers and  psychologist to share the healing movements with clients
To be used by groups who have suffered trauma to begin the divine healing movements together
To be part of the larger movement of healing the cry for help in every heart The heart of a personThe heart of the cityThe heart of a nation
To be of service to the healing of humanity, leading the way to true freedom, peace, joy, health and wholeness.Freedom from anxietyFreedom from fearFreedom from trauma2 Peter 1:3God's Divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through the full knowledge of the One who called us by his own glory and excellence.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a children's/teen's fantasy author who has been writing since I could hold a crayon. When I was battling cancer as a young boy, fantasy stories were my escape, and it is important to me to offer that same comfort and sense of adventure to a new generation of young readers. I've been working on this particular book series for a few years now. While the first book is doing well, I could use some help releasing the second book, which ties up the loose threads in the series. A few quick facts:</p>
<p>This particular series is important to me because it features a Latinx family as the heroes. It is important to me that young Latinx readers feel seen and represented in authentic and positive ways, empowering them to grow as heroes in the ""real world!""</p>
<p>If you want to know more about the series, you can read the blurb for the first book on <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Roses-Dragons-Den-Jacob-Devlin-ebook/dp/B07Q6RK9XY/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=roses+in+the+dragon%27s+den&amp;qid=1579546369&amp;sr=8-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amazon</a>.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The funds will go toward the cost of production for a Kindle and paperback version of BRAMBLES IN THE WISHING WELL. I am self-published by choice, and for consistency, I want to keep the same editor and designers I used for the first book. Based on the cost of production for the first book, I estimate the following:<ul>
<li>Cover Art: $600 (March 2020)</li>
<li>Professional Edits: $1600 (Fall 2020)</li>
<li>Interior Formatting: $375 (December 2020)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For your contributions, I offer the following perks:<ul>
<li>A preview of the first three chapters</li>
<li>Signed character prints, which have already been designed</li>
<li>A copy of the book when it is released in 2021</li>
<li>Your name in the acknowledgments as a valuable contributor</li>
<li>Your name in a future book as an actual character</li>
<li>Coffee/Lunch/Skype Session</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If I surpass my goal, additional funds would go to the cost of promotion: table fees for conventions, online ads, etc. It also secures the ability for me to continue writing and publishing after this book is released!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>The first book, ROSES IN THE DRAGON'S DEN, has been granted a New Apple Literary Award and is under consideration for a Wishing Shelf Award. It has garnered strong reviews and positive reception from children, parents, and school librarians.</li>
<li>There are still important strides to be made in including strong Latinx characters in fantasy, especially for children. We're getting there, but I simply want to add my voice, wherever it might be heard!</li>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You don't have to buy a book or donate to a campaign to show support. There are many small, free ways to make big differences. Here are just a few:</p>

<p>When I think about children’s books I read when growing up, there were very few characters who represented the Latinx culture. I wish I saw more books that included music I could relate to, food, language, or even scenery. </p>
<p>When children grow up not seeing themselves or their culture in books, it signals their culture is not worthy of representation. </p>
<p>In a study done by <a href=""https://ccbc.education.wisc.edu/the-numbers-are-in-2019-ccbc-diversity-statistics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cooperative Children’s Book Center</a> 2019, there were more children's books published featuring an animal main character than children's books featuring a Black, Native, Asian, or Latinx character. Let’s work on changing that. </p>
<p>My goal is to tackle this challenge by adding to the diversity in publishing and children’s books by creating this multicultural book featuring a Latinx character.</p>

</div></div>","Author's Website: https://aventurasenesl.com/    Roqui’s Pandero Beat is a multicultural book celebrating the musical genre of plena from Puerto Rico. Roquí is a coquí frog who wants to play plena on the pandero drum. He tends to focus on a repetitive musical beat throughout the story. While he does move to the U.S. mainland, he still holds on to his dream of performing as a pandero drummer, yet he's worried his small size will get in the way. As the story evolves, Roquí encounters classmates who play a similar music genre (bomba) and almost gives up on his dream. His perseverance and attitude shape the ending of the story.
The Sounds of a Pandero Drum





When I think about children’s books I read when growing up, there were very few characters who represented the Latinx culture. I wish I saw more books that included music I could relate to, food, language, or even scenery. 
When children grow up not seeing themselves or their culture in books, it signals their culture is not worthy of representation. 
In a study done by Cooperative Children’s Book Center 2019, there were more children's books published featuring an animal main character than children's books featuring a Black, Native, Asian, or Latinx character. Let’s work on changing that. 
My goal is to tackle this challenge by adding to the diversity in publishing and children’s books by creating this multicultural book featuring a Latinx character.









As an educator, I am depending on this campaign to help fund the book. Being on a teacher salary means using my savings to fund this dream. By contributing to my campaign, you will help expand multicultural literature into your home and/or school. 




Meet the Author
Delia Ruiz is an educator and writer. Writing a children’s book has always been a dream for her and with Roquí’s Pandero Beat, it will finally become a reality. Her inspiration for creating this book was rooted in sharing the Puerto Rican culture with her future children. ""When the time comes to have children, I want them to value both mine and my husband's cultures. I want them to  celebrate the music that comes from the island and know those roots are part of them too."" You can follow her journey on Instagram @aventuras.en.esl or Facebook as Aventuras En ESL
Meet the Illustrator
Luis Patiño is an artist based in Grapevine, Texas.  Luis has known Delia since high school and jumped on board to illustrate his first book. Luis is known for his watercolor style and designed the entire book using this medium. Some of his favorite things include plants, hiking, and enjoying the benefits of traveling. You can follow his journey @nino_planta.

Two years later Station Hill's close participation began on this 492-page collection, carefully selected with Coolidge's help and covering the first 20-plus years of his writing life. Larry and Clark wanted to do this project with us in part because of 
Station Hill's 35-year involvement with new poetry - publishing the 
earliest books by Hannah Wiener, Bernstein, Mac Low as well as John Cage, among many
 notable others - but also because we published Coolidge's poetic compatriot Bernadette Mayer <i>(<a href=""http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9781581771206/studying-hunger-journals.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Studying Hunger Journal </a></i>and, subsequently, <i><a href=""http://www.spdbooks.org/Producte/9781581771350/eating-the-colors-of-a-lineup-of-words-the-early-books-of-bernadette-mayer.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eating The Colors Of A Lineup Of Words: The Early Books of Bernadette Mayer</a></i>). <br/></p>
<p>So, five years later, we are very close to realization. Larry and Clark had finished their editing in late 2014, and it was passed on Miles Champion, whom Station Hill commissioned to make a clean transcription of all the poems. It was then passed back to Larry Fagin, and Michael Gonzales put the book into its initial InDesign format, which subsequently was perfected by Susan Quasha. Larry and Clark chose for the cover image a 1967 line drawing by Susan Coolidge of Clark at his drum set when he was playing in David Meltzer's band Serpent Power.  The <i>Selected</i> includes an introduction by Bill Berkson, entitled ""The Spools of Clark Coolidge,"" recounting Coolidge's coming up and influences as well as eloquently expressing the visionary nature of his poetic enterprise. <br/></p>
<p>We now are very close to having a finished, press-ready book, for which in part we returned to Miles, commissioning him to review and make final changes, which he has accomplished with characteristic acumen. We have advanced praise from John Ashbery (see below), Lyn Hejinian and Ron Silliman. We have even made an advance, uncorrected proof of the book, an image of which is above. <br/></p>
<p>Here's a slice of what Berkson says of Coolidge's work: “From the heights each poem appears to take its own peculiar plunge. The insistent musings, discriminations, glees, puzzlements, irritability, those sardonic driveby<br/>puns, and philosophic remarks that register almost as stage whispers without<br/>claiming any prior authority, all signify a powerful affection for the world as encompassed, and ultimately, Clark’s will to articulate that fabled specific infinity<br/>he has had his eye on, the ‘quest to know anything, write everything,’ the Chapel<br/>Perilous of these poems.”</p>
<p>Further, we would make some claims: <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>Clark Coolidge is securely among the giants of contemporary poetic practice</li>
<li>Into the foreseeable future this <i>Selected Poems</i> will be among the significant promontories from which that magnitude will be glimpsed<br/>
</li>
<li>Much of the experimental  whirring of the last 50 years are a footnote to or at best elaboration on the works of Clark Coolidge (maybe)<br/>
</li>
<li>Reading Coolidge's work is to ""come back, this time enclosed, trim in<br/>paper. Plain sky part of sewn perimeters. Gurries and wobblances. The handtorch shows the tune its rock to turn.""<br/>

</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We need $4,300 to do a  thousand-copy print run of the <i>Selected</i>.

Out of pure cussedness (as Ted Berrigan would have said) we've rounded that $4,300 figure up to $5,000 to help defray  a little of what we've paid out.<br/><br/>We are asking for $100 donations to this project, for which you will have your name inscribed in this historic big book - and, preferably, on a dedicated page if there are enough donors at this level.

<span>Hey everyone! I'm Sean Overman and I'm asking for your help to </span><span>publish </span><span>my first  book! </span><br/>
</h3>
<p>It's my novel called <i>City of Angeles and Discontent</i>. It's about a young professional  living in LA. He deals with the struggles of a dead end job and wants to live the American  dream. In the process, he breaks up with his fiancée of five years, dates vigorously in the city, finds a wife, then cheats on her too with multiple women. His is a path to self discovery or self destruction, but he doesn't know which. He also uncovers the truth about his dad's death and sees how that has affected him as a young man.</p>
<p><b>My Story</b></p>
<p><span>I come from a modest family. My dad was a brilliant man, but I lost him to tragedy when I was quite young. Thus, my mom raised a family of five on a bank teller's income until my siblings and I moved out to college. With little income and support, no dad to offer advice, love and care, I struggled through my life.</span></p>
<p><span>I've always wanted to write a book, but never knew I had the courage in me to do so. In high school, I was told by  friends that I was a good writer, but never pursued it. I was a troubled kid and often turned to drugs and alcohol as a way to cope. Eventually my past landed me in trouble and I knew that enough was enough. I needed to shape up and change my life. Eventually,</span><span> on the verge of graduation from high school,</span><span> I got the idea to be an FBI agent  and went to college to chase my dreams. </span></p>
<p><span>I  moved to LA with only $200 in my pocket and everything I owned in my tiny little hatchback.  After years at the university, I obtained my bachelor degree and figured I'd be a cop in no time. Boy was I wrong. I turned down many full time gigs for work, hoping to be a police officer. </span></p>
<p>I earned a career at a non profit org, where I've been for nearly a decade and work with probation youth and foster kids.  After so many years there, though I love my work and steering kids towards the right path on a daily basis, I figured I needed to guide myself and follow my one true love and art: writing.</p>
<p>Through a side gig, hustling at nights on a podcast, I developed a passion for discussing my favorite TV shows, writing news and gossip and interviewing my favorite actors.Through the podcast, I made a powerful connection who was interested in my ideas and suggested I write a book for her company.  At that point in my life, I had neither the time nor the belief in myself that I needed.</p>
<p><b>My Book</b></p>
<p>Two years later, I finally put pen to paper, fingers to keyboard and wrote to my heart's content. At first, I didn't know what I had written. I rewrote, cut, pasted annotated and consolidated everything I had. I culminated it into a compelling story about a young man living his life in a big city to find happiness. I emailed my old publisher contact. She was open and willing to evaluate my manuscript and give me excellent advice.  I shared my project and manuscript completion to a seminar headed by the founder of my podcast with 50 other cohosts present, to which I received a round of applause. I was surprised and a little embarrassed, but I received praise, support and great advice from everyone there. The founder has written two books herself and encouraged me to stay the course. </p>
<p>Further, at the seminar I got a great contact from two authors. One of which, has published over 20 books. I'd like to think of her as my mentor. She continues to give me great advice on the book publishing industry. It's sad, but it can be just as cut throat as the TV and film business. Luckily, I've gotten the courage and taken steps to self-publish.  I've asked many friends for help with social media and marketing strategies, cover art, to read it, proofread and give me encouragement on my journey. Thanks to my mom, family, friends and my loving wife for supporting me on this journey. Yet, I want to thank others out there. </p>
<p><b>Your Help</b></p>
<p>Some of the biggest challenges I face are: 1) finding an editor to help with my book and make it the best it can be, which can cost thousands of dollars, 2) self publishing my own book to get printed copies out to my readers, 3) marketing the book to a wide audience via radio, TV, social media, and podcasts.</p><p>So here I am, turning to you dreamers out there. If I can inspire you with my book, a passage, a quote, a phrase or a sentence that I wrote, then I'll know I made an impact in your life. </p>
<p>Therefore, I need your help to get this book off the ground, get it into the hands of others and make an impact in lives. Even if you can't donate, please let others know about my campaign. Share it on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and any other social media. Heck, even by word of mouth and snail mail! Many thanks and much gratitude in advance for making an author's dream come true!</p>

<div><br/></div> <ul> <li>Shamar Hill is a single father to a 6 year old son. He has been working on a poetry collection, <i>Photos of an Imagined Childhood</i> for almost 2 years.

<li>Shamar was accepted to the Bread Loaf Writers Conference which will take place August 12-22, 2015 in Middlebury, VT. However, the tuition (plus the room and board) is $3,050.

<p>If Shamar reaches the goal of $3,500 , it will pay for the tuition, room and board to attend Bread Loaf. Any additional funds will cover travel to Middlebury, VT.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you give $30, you will receive a personalized sampler chapbook from the collection <i>Photos of an Imagined Childhood</i></p>

<div>Hi. My name is Jari ""Sojari"" Bradley and I am a queer woman of color, broke college student, and spoken word artist. Out of a great number of applicants,I have recently been accepted to Callaloo's Creative Writing Workshop. I am now trying to get to Callaloo's Creative Writing Workshop which takes place May 31st- June 13th at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. You can find out more about Callaloo and its distinguished creative writing program here: <span style=""background-color: initial;""><a href=""http://callaloo.tamu.edu/2015-CCWW-USA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://callaloo.tamu.edu/2015-CCWW-USA</a></span>
</div>
<div>I need to reach my goal by May 28th, which is a very short amount of time. And while this is an incredible honor and a huge opportunity, I am not currently able to afford what it costs to make the trip as a broke college student. I've been spread pretty thin with the work of finishing my senior year as a Sociology major at San Francisco State University, getting things ready for graduation,  preparing myself for Graduate School, and other community-oriented projects (like coaching the Mills College CUPSI Slam Team). This is where I need your help and the help of my community, as it is important to invest in the lives and voices of working poor writers of color so that they may have access to spaces such as these. What you are able to contribute is not only about me realizing my own personal goals, but it is also a contribution to black voice in a time where violence committed against bodies that resemble my own are prevalent nationwide. I seek to utilize my voice in collaboration with other writers of color as a means of resistance, and my participation in Callaloo would greatly assist in that endeavor. <br/>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>As a queer woman of color writer, it is also not common for a voice like mine to be celebrated and upheld in mainstream discourse around socioeconomic inequity and police violence against black and brown bodies. My work as a writer, academic, and community leader is centered on making the conversation around black bodies and queer bodies of color more accessible and transparent despite the various obstacles set in place via oppression, racism, sexism, and homophobia. </p>
<p>Coming from meager means, it is hard to come up with enough money on my own to take this opportunity that has been afforded to me. So without community support, I won't be able to attend Callaloo. But with your help, I can guarantee this opportunity will help me grow in my work immensely. </p>

<h3>Breve reseña</h3> <p></p>
<p>Hola a todos, soy Carlos Jiménez
Duarte: autor de la novela Alumbramiento de una estrella, la cual es la primera
entrega de la saga literaria El Renacer de los Astros. Quiero ser un escritor
consagrado a la creación literaria y hacer una revolución en las mentes a
través de mi imaginación y los contenidos expuestos en mis libros, donde se
trabajan temáticas sobre la mente humano, la esperanza y el poder de la fe para
unir la voluntad de toda la humanidad hacia una ruta de paz y armonía. </p>
<p>Pero, en el mundo actual, los escritores
que mejor pueden cumplir ese sueño son aquellos que son patrocinados por las
editoriales y las librerías. Para darme a conocer quiero iniciar una campaña de
Bookcrossing, que es una forma de dejar que los libros viajen a través de las
personas y por el mundo, de modo que mis lectores se hagan una idea del libro
que ofrezco a través de Amazon. Un libro colocado deliberadamente en una mesa
de un café puede ser el motivo suficiente para que un lector se tome la
molestia de disfrutar al menos las primeras 5 páginas de mi libro y quedar tan
cautivado que esté dispuesto a comprarlo en su versión digital, por tan solo
$0,99 dólares. El Bookcrossing es una técnica muy útil para hacer llegar los
contenidos de un libro, volviéndolo en una obra popular que pasa de voz a voz
hasta convertirse en un éxito literario. </p>

<p>El presupuesto para este proyecto sirve
para financiar al menos 120 libros, con el contenido impreso en su totalidad de
mi novela. Serán 120 libros que viajarán por todo el mundo, ya que no solo los
dejaría libres para que se muevan en mi propio país, sino que a través de mis

<p>El libro está en todo el potencial de convertirse en un best-seller,
inaugurando una nueva legión de lectores apasionados por los temas de mi obra y

triunfar por otros medios como lo puede ser un ebook bajo el patrocinio y la
pubilicidad gestada con un buen sistema de bookcrossing. Es una idea revolucionaria
que demuestra que si es posible </p>
<p>El arte y la literatura que expongo en mi obra, permite a sus lectores
soñar con sus contenidos y ver más allá de los límites de la mente humana. Se
trata de una novela que emocionante que cambiará la vida de muchas personas y
ofrece nuevas puertas sobre la espiritualidad y la voluntad del ser humano. Una
novela de aventuras totalmente épica que nos transporta a un mundo maravilloso
y novedoso como lo es el planeta Ulmuden, lo que enseña de paso a las
sociedades que vivir en paz y mantenerse al margen de los poderes del mal si es
posible. Un libro que nos deja comprometernos con el destino de nuestro planeta
y la naturaleza que posee, tal como se vivencia en este epicentro literario. </p>
<p>Si las cosas marchan mejor, quizá la novela pase a convertirse en un

<p>The books that I remember most from my childhood are the giant, illustrated poetry collections my mom would read to me; Calvin &amp; Hobbes; stories from the Bible; DK visual dictionaries about castles and knights and other unknown things; and the weird stories about aliens and spaceships that we'd find in coloring books and on the sides of boxes of gummy fruit snacks.</p>
<p>They were all Big Books. Big Books are freakin' <i>great</i>.</p>
<p>In size, to be sure. You won't find many books thicker than a picture Bible. The story treasuries were always so tall that they had their own place on the top shelf. Calvin &amp; Hobbes was always tricky because they were so long that you'd bump into them if you walked too close to the bookcase.</p>
<p>Just <i>holding</i> a book that's physically too big to hold is exciting - if you don't believe me, go try it right now.</p>
<p>But they were also big in ideas. History. Concept. Intelligence. Depth. I can go back to any of those and find something new, even after reading it for almost three decades. (Well, maybe not the fruit snacks.)</p>
<p>They inspired me - both then, as a kid, and now, as an adult. They make me want to see the beauty and wonder that I know are all around me in the world. And, yeah, you know, fruit snacks are just as important as the rest of them in all of that.</p>
<p>These kind of Big Books are hard to find. They're expensive - not to mention risky - to make. But that doesn't make them any less important.</p>
<p>So I decided to make one of my own. A Big Book, with lots of cool pictures and weird stories and interesting ideas and new worlds, something that children would enjoy just as much as adults.</p>
<p>And this is it.</p>

<p>I'm Jeremiah. I'm a creator and an English teacher at Hebei Normal University in Shijiazhuang, the capital city of Hebei Province, China. I really like finding new ways of looking at the world, and to me, blending the linguistic and visual arts is the perfect way to do that.</p>
<p>About six years ago, I wrote a short story about crows turning into the night sky, and thought it would be cool to make it into an illustrated children's story. I talked to my friend Kristin, a local artist, and she thought it would be cool, too.  At the time, she was drawing a series of living dresses. We figured there had to be a story behind them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a friend teaching English in Vietnam sent me books of local children's tales featuring cute forest animals doing inexplicably horrible things to each other and frogs literally exploding in anger.</p>

<p>Don't worry, I <i>do</i> know what ""literally"" means.</p>
<p>In the course of writing stories about whatever came into my mind, a pile of surreal and not-quite-normal stories collated. The kids who read them seemed to enjoy them immensely. Making a book out of the whole thing seemed like the thing to do.</p>

<p>There will be approximately fifteen stories within the book's 80 pages. I won't describe them because the titles describe them pretty accurately. Also I want to create this kind of aura of mystique around the stories. Is that a thing? Pretty sure it is.</p>

</div></div>","Stories aren't just what you read; they're what you tell. They take you through new doors to new places. We've put together The Crown of Secrets, a big book of stories and pictures about tigers and papayas and robots and tapioca pudding (and much more), to do just that.  15 stories of the weird and wonderful, fully illustrated by eight fantastic artists 9""x12"" hardcover; pages printed on heavy, high-quality paper Suitable for children, adults, and everybody else  We've been collaborating together on this book for well over a year and are extremely excited to bring it to you.


Art from Little Drifters (Jake Cochrane)
______________________________________________________


The books that I remember most from my childhood are the giant, illustrated poetry collections my mom would read to me; Calvin & Hobbes; stories from the Bible; DK visual dictionaries about castles and knights and other unknown things; and the weird stories about aliens and spaceships that we'd find in coloring books and on the sides of boxes of gummy fruit snacks.
They were all Big Books. Big Books are freakin' great.
In size, to be sure. You won't find many books thicker than a picture Bible. The story treasuries were always so tall that they had their own place on the top shelf. Calvin & Hobbes was always tricky because they were so long that you'd bump into them if you walked too close to the bookcase.
Just holding a book that's physically too big to hold is exciting - if you don't believe me, go try it right now.
But they were also big in ideas. History. Concept. Intelligence. Depth. I can go back to any of those and find something new, even after reading it for almost three decades. (Well, maybe not the fruit snacks.)
They inspired me - both then, as a kid, and now, as an adult. They make me want to see the beauty and wonder that I know are all around me in the world. And, yeah, you know, fruit snacks are just as important as the rest of them in all of that.
These kind of Big Books are hard to find. They're expensive - not to mention risky - to make. But that doesn't make them any less important.
So I decided to make one of my own. A Big Book, with lots of cool pictures and weird stories and interesting ideas and new worlds, something that children would enjoy just as much as adults.
And this is it.

Page from Hunting My Dress (Kristin Richland)
______________________________________________________


I'm Jeremiah. I'm a creator and an English teacher at Hebei Normal University in Shijiazhuang, the capital city of Hebei Province, China. I really like finding new ways of looking at the world, and to me, blending the linguistic and visual arts is the perfect way to do that.
About six years ago, I wrote a short story about crows turning into the night sky, and thought it would be cool to make it into an illustrated children's story. I talked to my friend Kristin, a local artist, and she thought it would be cool, too.  At the time, she was drawing a series of living dresses. We figured there had to be a story behind them.
Meanwhile, a friend teaching English in Vietnam sent me books of local children's tales featuring cute forest animals doing inexplicably horrible things to each other and frogs literally exploding in anger.

Don't worry, I do know what ""literally"" means.
In the course of writing stories about whatever came into my mind, a pile of surreal and not-quite-normal stories collated. The kids who read them seemed to enjoy them immensely. Making a book out of the whole thing seemed like the thing to do.
______________________________________________________   

There will be approximately fifteen stories within the book's 80 pages. I won't describe them because the titles describe them pretty accurately. Also I want to create this kind of aura of mystique around the stories. Is that a thing? Pretty sure it is.

A typical planner helps you track the various stages of pregnancy; some of the more intricate planners also feature countdowns. A few might even allow you to track your doctor’s appointments, growth milestones, diet, “To Do” lists, shopping lists, etc. Others are more like journals with writing prompts and questions. Both types are typically full of helpful facts and tidbits about pregnancy, birth, and newborn care—but not a lot of detailed information or rigorous research. These really serve more as keepsakes or mementos of your pregnancy than as in-depth planners.</p><p>Additionally, you may be familiar with the massive—but amazingly helpful—wedding planners and wedding binders currently available on the market. These help brides-to-be plan every last detail of their dream day. They include a great deal of information on all the various steps of planning a wedding and allow readers to lay down exactly how they want their special day to go.</p><p>Now imagine a birth planner—a guidebook—with the detail and completeness of a wedding planner, but focused on orchestrating your own natural birth, home birth, or a more conventional birth. That's the Dream Birth Project. I want the Dream Birth Planner and Guide to inspire a woman to see her birth, first and foremost, as an amazing—even sacred—event; one that deserves all the forethought and planning of any other life-altering, socially powerful, and celebrated moment. The planner and guidebook would be specifically geared toward natural birth and home birth and would educate and empower the expecting mother (and her partner) to take the reins of her pregnancy and birth. It would provide all the information, resources, suggested readings, and tangible tools needed to plan every aspect of a “dream” natural or home birth, with all of the safety measures and backup planning in place.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h3>My Progress</h3><div>The starting point for this project is all of the research I did in planning my own birth experience...the home birth of my son. I also have the very detailed birth plans (with back-up plans) I developed, as well as the experience of pulling together the resources needed for a home birth, and the coordination of doulas, midwives and the like.</div><p> </p><p>The table of contents—including the desired vignettes, features, tables, charts, and forms—is complete. A writing, publishing, and marketing team is in place (all part of a new venture called The Island—but more on that later) to assist with content creation, research, compiling and assembling, copyediting, publishing, and finally, printing and distribution. With my years of publishing and project management experience, my own personal home birth success, and the initial conception and vision for this project, I truly believe that I’m the right person to bring this unique and much-needed birth tool to the market. My team and I are excited to be working on the first stages of prototyping and plan to have the overall look and design nailed down soon.</p><p> </p><h1> </h1><h3><b style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">About The Team</b></h3><h4> </h4><p style=""line-height: 24px;""> </p><p style=""line-height: 24px;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Jenefier Winchell</span></span></p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;line-height: 24px;"">Mother of Three.

A typical planner helps you track the various stages of pregnancy; some of the more intricate planners also feature countdowns. A few might even allow you to track your doctor’s appointments, growth milestones, diet, “To Do” lists, shopping lists, etc. Others are more like journals with writing prompts and questions. Both types are typically full of helpful facts and tidbits about pregnancy, birth, and newborn care—but not a lot of detailed information or rigorous research. These really serve more as keepsakes or mementos of your pregnancy than as in-depth planners.Additionally, you may be familiar with the massive—but amazingly helpful—wedding planners and wedding binders currently available on the market. These help brides-to-be plan every last detail of their dream day. They include a great deal of information on all the various steps of planning a wedding and allow readers to lay down exactly how they want their special day to go.Now imagine a birth planner—a guidebook—with the detail and completeness of a wedding planner, but focused on orchestrating your own natural birth, home birth, or a more conventional birth. That's the Dream Birth Project. I want the Dream Birth Planner and Guide to inspire a woman to see her birth, first and foremost, as an amazing—even sacred—event; one that deserves all the forethought and planning of any other life-altering, socially powerful, and celebrated moment. The planner and guidebook would be specifically geared toward natural birth and home birth and would educate and empower the expecting mother (and her partner) to take the reins of her pregnancy and birth. It would provide all the information, resources, suggested readings, and tangible tools needed to plan every aspect of a “dream” natural or home birth, with all of the safety measures and backup planning in place.  My ProgressThe starting point for this project is all of the research I did in planning my own birth experience...the home birth of my son. I also have the very detailed birth plans (with back-up plans) I developed, as well as the experience of pulling together the resources needed for a home birth, and the coordination of doulas, midwives and the like. The table of contents—including the desired vignettes, features, tables, charts, and forms—is complete. A writing, publishing, and marketing team is in place (all part of a new venture called The Island—but more on that later) to assist with content creation, research, compiling and assembling, copyediting, publishing, and finally, printing and distribution. With my years of publishing and project management experience, my own personal home birth success, and the initial conception and vision for this project, I truly believe that I’m the right person to bring this unique and much-needed birth tool to the market. My team and I are excited to be working on the first stages of prototyping and plan to have the overall look and design nailed down soon.  About The Team  Jenefier WinchellMother of Three. Life Blogger, Crunchy, Plant Based, Environmentalists, Philosopher, Writer, Artist, Gentle Parent, Birth Enthusiasts, Project Manager, Publishing Manager, Textbook Acquisitions, Book Pre-production Manager  In short, I am a textbook development and acquisitions manager turned mom overnight. Almost four years ago, my partner and I began fostering his niece and nephew. It was then that I began my journey of conscious parenting. Once expecting, I took on pregnancy and birth much like I take on all new ventures in my life—with plenty of thought, research, and attention to detail. It was only natural that I would stumble upon the idea of a natural and home birth. The more research I did the more I was convinced that it was the most safest and most logical choice.Now a little over a year after having my own amazing home birth, The Dream Birth Project is now my passion. I am on a journey to share my experience and hard-won knowledge with the birthing world! I believe the Dream Birth Planner and Guide is not only a project worth funding but also, if done correctly, a project with the potential to make waves in the birthing community and beyond.  Amber PoeschelMother, Wife, Activist, Doula, Advocate, Educator, Writer, Community Resource  Other than being a wife and mother to two little boys, I am a birth and postpartum doula in Northern California with a focus on loving women through their most vulnerable time through community, empowerment, and education. I have been involved in the natural birthing community since 2011 and I spend my time educating and advocating as a blogger in my free time. Richard SchofieldInventor, Engineer and Serial Entrepreneur  I'm lucky. I have a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering and a thirst for innovation. I've been an entrepreneur for thirty years and have started three successful companies. I hold five U.S. patents and have over twenty papers in scientific journals. My experiences include environmental engineering, web development, publishing, and e-commerce technology. I've been a professor, a business manager, a scientist, and a husband and father. I'm an avid outdoor enthusiast and I live to create new things. The Plan With this crowdfunding campaign, we hope to raise the funds that I need to buy the time necessary to continue to research, write, compile, and design the Dream Birth Planner and Guide. It’s my hope that crowdfunding will take care of the financial aspect of the project, allowing me and my team—and, if you’re willing, you—to focus on the heart of the project: the ideas.Crowdfunding 101  With the help of a crowdfunding platform and a solid pitch, campaign video, social media buzz, and local support, anyone can connect with an audience that cares about and believes in their venture. People throughout the country (and world) can contribute to an idea in whatever amount they’re comfortable with, often contributing in the form of a preorder of the finished product. This means that creators are no longer tied to commercial sponsors or large investors. This allows for greater freedom and increases the likelihood that worthy projects will get the funds they need to come to fruition. How You Can Help First and foremost, you can help by generating buzz and getting the word out. If you believe our project could be helpful to someone you know, tell them! Mention it to your inner circle via email, social media feeds, blogs, and personal websites. It’s our belief that there are people out there waiting for a book like this—we just need some way to let them know what we’re up to!

write for a living. But s</b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">ince I have
finally realised my dream of becoming an author (I have already published my
two first books in French at Magical Publishing / Les Éditions Magiques, a
publishing house I have founded 5 years ago), I really wish to go further and
higher with my company by publishing in English the very first Volume of my
French series, La Robe jaune, which in English is The Yellow Dress Volume 1:
Mom in Heaven. By publishing the first Volume in English, the market will then
become global (the planet), so I will be able to reach more readers, that means
I will be able to bring magic in more hearts &amp; lives, which is my purpose,
and the purpose of Magical Publishing / Les Éditions Magiques. By selling more
books, my publishing house will get bigger. Then, I will be able to publish new
authors' books, thus helping new authors to realize their own dream of becoming
an author, the dream I had when I was a kid. I also wish to publish and launch
the third Volume of The Yellow Dress in French, La Robe jaune tome 3.</b></p>
<p><b>Because my
purpose &amp; the purpose of Magical Publishing is to bring magic in the hearts
&amp; lives of people, it was naturally that we have concluded a partnership
with The Children's Wish Foundation (La Fondation Rêves d'enfants); for every
book soled at Magical Publishing / Les Éditions Magiques, 1$ (one dollar) will
be given to The Children's Wish Foundation. Another good reason to contribute
to my project. For more information, visit <a href=""http://www.childrenswish.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.childrenswish.ca</a> </b></p>

information about my projects: The first Volume of The Yellow Dress has already been translated
from a professional translator from French to English. What is needed from now
is to print it, promote it and launch it. I will organize great book launches
in Montréal (Québec) CANADA, in the USA (New York), and in other cities in the
USA, and in United Kingdom (London), in 2016. And you will be invited as a VIP guest!
Plus, the book launches will be organized in very nice places with the help of
many artists and major business partners. I will also launch the third Volume

<p><b>Help me reach my goal of 10,000$. I will also ask contributions to other private investors until I reach my goal, because I really

only to the big publishing houses, I have never received any penny from them.
With your contribution, you will participate in an important mission: to help literature,
to help a young publishing house specialized in modern tales (fantasy and fairy
tales), to bring magic in the lives of sick children &amp; in the heart of
other readers, plus you will bring magic in the lives of people who want to
become an author, because Magical Publishing publishes new talented authors. With the publishing of my first two books in French, I
have already spread magic in the lives of thousands of readers. They
really appreciate the story of <i>The Yellow Dress </i>and the main
message included in this fantasy, fairy tale: <i>When you dare to be
yourself, Miracles happen</i>. I personally believe in that message because I

Et, à ceux que je n'ai pas encore eu la chance de connaître, je dis : au plaisir de vous rencontrer !Je vous souhaite beaucoup de magie dans votre vie et dans votre coeur !Comme le dit si bien la princesse à La Robe jaune : Quand on ose être soi-même, les miracles s'accomplissent !Magiquement Vôtre,IsabelleENGLISH VERSIONSince I was a
kid, my biggest dream was to become an author & writer. I have always been passionate
by writing and reading. Books were, and are still, my very precious things, my
treasure. Before I became an author, I became a journalist because I wanted to
write for a living. But since I have
finally realised my dream of becoming an author (I have already published my
two first books in French at Magical Publishing / Les Éditions Magiques, a
publishing house I have founded 5 years ago), I really wish to go further and
higher with my company by publishing in English the very first Volume of my
French series, La Robe jaune, which in English is The Yellow Dress Volume 1:
Mom in Heaven. By publishing the first Volume in English, the market will then
become global (the planet), so I will be able to reach more readers, that means
I will be able to bring magic in more hearts & lives, which is my purpose,
and the purpose of Magical Publishing / Les Éditions Magiques. By selling more
books, my publishing house will get bigger. Then, I will be able to publish new
authors' books, thus helping new authors to realize their own dream of becoming
an author, the dream I had when I was a kid. I also wish to publish and launch
the third Volume of The Yellow Dress in French, La Robe jaune tome 3.
Because my
purpose & the purpose of Magical Publishing is to bring magic in the hearts
& lives of people, it was naturally that we have concluded a partnership
with The Children's Wish Foundation (La Fondation Rêves d'enfants); for every
book soled at Magical Publishing / Les Éditions Magiques, 1$ (one dollar) will
be given to The Children's Wish Foundation. Another good reason to contribute
to my project. For more information, visit www.childrenswish.ca 

More
information about my projects: The first Volume of The Yellow Dress has already been translated
from a professional translator from French to English. What is needed from now
is to print it, promote it and launch it. I will organize great book launches
in Montréal (Québec) CANADA, in the USA (New York), and in other cities in the
USA, and in United Kingdom (London), in 2016. And you will be invited as a VIP guest!
Plus, the book launches will be organized in very nice places with the help of
many artists and major business partners. I will also launch the third Volume
in French, La Robe jaune tome 3, in Montréal & in Paris in 2016.
Help me reach my goal of 10,000$. I will also ask contributions to other private investors until I reach my goal, because I really
believe in what I do and where I want to go. Since the government give money
only to the big publishing houses, I have never received any penny from them.
With your contribution, you will participate in an important mission: to help literature,
to help a young publishing house specialized in modern tales (fantasy and fairy
tales), to bring magic in the lives of sick children & in the heart of
other readers, plus you will bring magic in the lives of people who want to
become an author, because Magical Publishing publishes new talented authors. With the publishing of my first two books in French, I
have already spread magic in the lives of thousands of readers. They
really appreciate the story of The Yellow Dress and the main
message included in this fantasy, fairy tale: When you dare to be
yourself, Miracles happen. I personally believe in that message because I
have experienced it in my own life. If you wish to hear from the readers
of The Yellow Dress, you can read their testimony (in French for now, in English soon). Visit the Magical Publishing' Web site www.leseditionsmagiques.com OR www.magicalpublishing.com (not yet completed, but soon !) You can also visit our Facebook' pages: www.facebook.com/larobejaune123 & www.facebook.com/editionsmagiques and www.twitter.com/editionsmagique
To launch my
book in English in Canada, in the USA and in UK is a pretty nice challenge to
me, but the purpose worth it. Same thing about the Volume 3 in French. Would you like to participate and be involved in
this great adventure? If your answer is yes, please contribute now! If you cannot
contribute but would like to be involved in the adventure, maybe you can spread
the word and make some noise about it. If you are willing to do so, just use
the Indiegogo share tools! That's all you need to do to contribute to 3
heartily causes: literature, sick children & new authors. Please help and
spread the Magic! I will be so grateful! Thank you and I wish you a lot of
Magic in your life and in your heart! Do not hesitate to offer The Yellow Dress (in French for now) as a Christmas gift !And don't forget; this is just the beginning as I will, next year, publish new authors / new tales for children.

<p>
Margo
Candelario was born in San Bernardino, California. She moved to New
York at the age of seventeen, where her interest in the arts and
culture flourished. She attended Germaine School of Photography in
1984 studying commercial manipulation of lights, props, cable
releases and the dark room, spending hours in the dark studying every
shade of gray. She welcomed the challenge of discovering where her
talents were the strongest, behind the lens in plain sight or in the
dark. 
</p>
<p>
Seven
years later she married Phil Candelario, had their first daughter and
relocated to the State of Georgia, seeking a slower pace and
healthier environment.  Unable to find employment outside of the
home, Margo began to focus on her God given talent to create art,
learning the market and finding a niche. As her name began to
generate a buzz in the art community, her husband suffered a massive
heart attack at the age of thirty four, leaving three children with
questions and fear of death and separation. Uncomfortable leaving
three small children in the care of strangers, Ms. Candelario
resurrected her talent for storytelling and writing to generate an
income while also helping others who have suffered a loss. “Take Me
To The Water” was her first book of poems about love and the
benefits of waiting for the natural sequence of relationship
development.</p>
<p>
Margo
was invited to lecture and perform her poetry at several Universities
in the states of Georgia, South Carolina, and New York, earning her
the 1999 author of the year poetry category nomination. In 2008 six
poems were  published in an Anthology called “The New Poetry
Showcase Myspace” by Copeland Books in the U.K and in 2009 her
children’s book “Looking to the Clouds for Daddy” illustrated
by Jerry Craft was released and reviewed by notables. Margo
Candelario is an accomplished, award winning visual artist with works
exhibited from Hawaii to the eastern seaboard. She currently resides
in Georgia with her three daughters and Mother who share in a family
business called Young Female Farmers, specializing in Naturally Grown
produce and baked goods.</p><p><a href=""http://youngfemalefarmers.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://youngfemalefarmers.com</a><br/></p>
<p>Hello
I am <b>John
Gholson</b>,
and I am working together with Margo, a seasoned writer for this
unique children's book.  I have a gift which lets me express my
ideas, visions, and surroundings, in a visually unique way. My
ultimate dream is to find balance in my life, work, and adventures
outside of the studio. My future plans will focus on this vision,
along with the people who would like to see my dream become a
reality.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1162749/files/20150120122610-park3flat5_640.jpeg?1421785570"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>I
have been surrounded by art my entire life. My mother is an artist,
so I was encouraged to draw and paint at a very young age. I
submitted my first painting for exhibit at age 6; since then, I have
been acclaimed as a talented young artist. My style is to incorporate
a broad array of bright colors into my artwork; saying more with
less.  Continue reading about my artist – illustrator bio here

For
this project, I am using a  traditional to digital work flow.  It is
a superior technique to get the best of both worlds; and is cutting
edge, using the latest most up to date technologies combined with the
great masters layering methods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
I
also use light plus shadows, with a middle ground foreground, and
background for each illustration.  Making sure that every page, is a
work of art by itself. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I
bring a great use of perspective to the illustrations; that will help
create the environment for the scenes in the story. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FoZZQDMuYBLE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoZZQDMuYBLE&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FoZZQDMuYBLE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/>

To
see this project to completion Margo and I need to raise 10,000
dollars to finish  the book and contribute to distribution, marketing, and creation cost.  
</p>
<p>
For
the digital books we are going to be utilizing the amazon kindle
platform, which Margo's other book, ""Looking to the Clouds for Daddy"",
is now available on.</p>
<p>We are focusing most of our efforts on the ebook Kindle platform.  At certain donation levels we will be
offering full black and white coloring books of the story with the
characters.  Keep in mind that at the 3<sup>rd</sup>
donation levels you can take home an original piece of artwork from
the book.  
</p>
<p>
Each
illustration takes approximately 1 – 2 days to complete, scan
digitize and convert the line drawing to a colored page.  The book is
going to have many illustrations, full color, high quality.  
</p>
<p>
Margo
needs time, a very important resource for all writers and artist, to
fine tune and add the finishing touches to the story.  For many
people reading this, you may have never created a work of art or
poetry, you may see it as a magical process.  It is magical, but it takes
time, money, and resources to create.  We both have years of  training
and real world success in our chosen fields.  You are working with

home, Margo began to focus on her God given talent to create art,
learning the market and finding a niche. As her name began to
generate a buzz in the art community, her husband suffered a massive
heart attack at the age of thirty four, leaving three children with
questions and fear of death and separation. Uncomfortable leaving
three small children in the care of strangers, Ms. Candelario
resurrected her talent for storytelling and writing to generate an
income while also helping others who have suffered a loss. “Take Me
To The Water” was her first book of poems about love and the
benefits of waiting for the natural sequence of relationship
development.

Margo
was invited to lecture and perform her poetry at several Universities
in the states of Georgia, South Carolina, and New York, earning her
the 1999 author of the year poetry category nomination. In 2008 six
poems were  published in an Anthology called “The New Poetry
Showcase Myspace” by Copeland Books in the U.K and in 2009 her
children’s book “Looking to the Clouds for Daddy” illustrated
by Jerry Craft was released and reviewed by notables. Margo
Candelario is an accomplished, award winning visual artist with works
exhibited from Hawaii to the eastern seaboard. She currently resides
in Georgia with her three daughters and Mother who share in a family
business called Young Female Farmers, specializing in Naturally Grown
produce and baked goods.http://youngfemalefarmers.com
Hello
I am John
Gholson,
and I am working together with Margo, a seasoned writer for this
unique children's book.  I have a gift which lets me express my
ideas, visions, and surroundings, in a visually unique way. My
ultimate dream is to find balance in my life, work, and adventures
outside of the studio. My future plans will focus on this vision,
along with the people who would like to see my dream become a
reality.I
have been surrounded by art my entire life. My mother is an artist,
so I was encouraged to draw and paint at a very young age. I
submitted my first painting for exhibit at age 6; since then, I have
been acclaimed as a talented young artist. My style is to incorporate
a broad array of bright colors into my artwork; saying more with
less.  Continue reading about my artist – illustrator bio here

For
this project, I am using a  traditional to digital work flow.  It is
a superior technique to get the best of both worlds; and is cutting
edge, using the latest most up to date technologies combined with the
great masters layering methods.


I
also use light plus shadows, with a middle ground foreground, and
background for each illustration.  Making sure that every page, is a
work of art by itself. 


I
bring a great use of perspective to the illustrations; that will help
create the environment for the scenes in the story. 
This
campaign is important to both Margo and I for several reasons

it
addresses these current relevant topics.


""healthy
eating""

""conflict
resolution""

""negotiation
skills""

""persuasion
methods""

""healthy
sense of adventure and exploration""


By
endorsing this project you are supporting all of the ideologies
presented above, and you are helping two talented passionate
individuals follow their dreams by pursuing their craft.  If you
cannot donate to the project financially, but still want to support
what we are doing thats okay.  Please spread the word to your friends and family, to let them know that you are as excited as we are, and want to spread
the positive story campaign to those who need and would like to hear
it!  Thank you for taking your time thus far to read this
information.  






			What
			We Need & What You Get






To
see this project to completion Margo and I need to raise 10,000
dollars to finish  the book and contribute to distribution, marketing, and creation cost.  


For
the digital books we are going to be utilizing the amazon kindle
platform, which Margo's other book, ""Looking to the Clouds for Daddy"",
is now available on.
We are focusing most of our efforts on the ebook Kindle platform.  At certain donation levels we will be
offering full black and white coloring books of the story with the
characters.  Keep in mind that at the 3rd
donation levels you can take home an original piece of artwork from
the book.  


Each
illustration takes approximately 1 – 2 days to complete, scan
digitize and convert the line drawing to a colored page.  The book is
going to have many illustrations, full color, high quality.  


Margo
needs time, a very important resource for all writers and artist, to
fine tune and add the finishing touches to the story.  For many
people reading this, you may have never created a work of art or
poetry, you may see it as a magical process.  It is magical, but it takes
time, money, and resources to create.  We both have years of  training
and real world success in our chosen fields.  You are working with
professionals.  




There
are several perks that are included for donating to this project. 


In
fact there are 3 categories of support.  And there are 9 donation
levels.

A mandatory sentence is a court decision where judicial

What would you do if you learned your son was a going to be a

Taylor’s family faces a
crisis of their own as they live through the horror of a rape charge against
him … the broken justice system … the unwitting betrayal caused by the wrong
words uttered to the wrong person. 
Why this book now?  Because my wife and I were disgusted when we visited our son and the number of similar young men facing the same fate or worse. I am also the author of the forthcoming novel, Edge of 17. This book is about love and redemption, sex crimes and the nation’s broken justice system.I know about the Colorado justice system – I learned it the hard way.I want
this story to serve as a beacon for other families facing the uncertainties of

I hope I reach my goal, as it's the only way I could really afford this dream, and that I am able to share it with you every step of the way.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>
My name is Ian Hughes.  I found my passion for writing back in the summer of 2012.  Although
creative and imaginary with my works, I have been writing stories since I was
told off at school to what I can and cannot write in a story.  I
decided to ignore my teacher and wrote whatever came from my heart without any boundaries.
  Currently writing for both children and adults in various fields
including children's books, published poetry and also the paranormal
to which I have a keen interest.   I want you to feel and experience how I feel
in the stories and accounts which I am telling as though you were there with me.</p>
<p>Having
had a cancer scare back in the summer of 2014 which placed my books and
ideas on the back burner for a while, this enabled me to re-think my
stories and give them the passion I think they deserve and thinks
you as the reader will love for many years to come.</p>

A

My name is Ian Hughes.  I found my passion for writing back in the summer of 2012.  Although

ideas on the back burner for a while, this enabled me to re-think my
stories and give them the passion I think they deserve and thinks
you as the reader will love for many years to come.


The campaign funding is for marketing and getting me across the United Kingdom and in to schools, children's hospitals and book signing events in and around the UK.  Further funding over my threshold would enable me to provide 10% of the over funding to be given to Bleakholt Animal Sanctuary in Greater Manchester.  I have a dog from here who aptly named him Bolt because he is super fast :) If we somehow manage to over fund for a trip to the US to promote my book would be absolutely amazing and hopefully see some of you kind people at a book signing.  If we are so successful that some crazy billionaire likes my project and gives me an amazing amount to use then this will be used for a website to promote the characters and maybe a gaming app for your phone too.  I have so many ideas, so many things to think about that I think it is amazing.

If I don't reach my target, that is okay, I will have to downscale the Countrywide book tour, dependant on what the outcome brings whatever the amount of funding is provided be sure that it will be spent on marketing my book and getting it out there as much as I humanly can.    The Impact  I feel my project on Zeki and the Space Cadets can be valuable as it teaches kids and even young adults what it is like to grow up in a world of bullying, war and sadness, but gives enough hope that no matter what happens around us, the world can be one amazing place to be.  If I am lucky enough to get enough funding to provide my book to the third world and bring hope and joy through reading and learning then I feel I have done something right in my life.  It's all about giving.

I wanted to be able to hire some other folks to write for the site--with a particular focus on hiring writers of color, and folks who could write about organizing that was happening outside of DC and New York, or about organizing that went beyond responding to our present moment to look at what was coming down the road in 10 or 15 years. </p>
<p>A lot has changed for me, personally, since I launched this site. I went from having a half-time job and a consulting gig to being a full-time consultant, and back to having a full-time job. Particularly since returning to work full-time, I've struggled to maintain regular posting of my own, much less having the ability to manage writers. </p>
<p>Some folks have been kind enough to support us on <a href=""https://www.patreon.com/katisipp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patreon</a>, and I really appreciate that funding. But it only comes in when we have an original post up (ie--the weekly newsletter doesn't trigger contributions), and that can be infrequent. If you're already contributing on <b>Patreon</b>--don't worry, I'm not asking you for more money. And thank you, for being an early supporter!</p>
<p>At this point, I'm honestly conflicted about whether it makes sense for us to continue trying to put out original reporting. And so I'm coming to you, the audience, to tell me what you want to see. </p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Goal</h3> <p>The goal of this campaign is to raise $6,000, which basically covers two pieces of original reporting a month for a year. If we don't reach that goal, we'll use whatever money comes in to run for this year.</p>
<p>Right now, we pay $250 per post for regular writers, and $75 per post for guest writers. Your freelance writing folks will tell you, that's higher than most online sites pay. But this site is about economic justice, especially in the new economy. It would be kind of messed up to pay people peanuts. </p>
<p>All the money that is raised will be used to pay writers. The infrastructure costs, such as they are, will continue to be paid for by me. I don't pay myself for work on the site--I have a good-paying job, and I'd rather spend the money that's raised on funding writers. </p>

</div><div> <p>It's certainly possible that all of you out there don't care that much for the original reporting that this site has produced, or share my vision of a site that isn't telling you the same stories you can find in other parts of the labor press. In that case, I'll stop trying to make fetch happen, and just focus on finding you more links about robots, or snarky stories about Uber.</p>

</div></div>","Iterate Often Hack the Union started as a bootstrapped project--basically, I spent a bunch of months working as a consultant, and used some of the money from my consulting for the first year's worth of stories. I wanted to be able to hire some other folks to write for the site--with a particular focus on hiring writers of color, and folks who could write about organizing that was happening outside of DC and New York, or about organizing that went beyond responding to our present moment to look at what was coming down the road in 10 or 15 years. 
A lot has changed for me, personally, since I launched this site. I went from having a half-time job and a consulting gig to being a full-time consultant, and back to having a full-time job. Particularly since returning to work full-time, I've struggled to maintain regular posting of my own, much less having the ability to manage writers. 
Some folks have been kind enough to support us on Patreon, and I really appreciate that funding. But it only comes in when we have an original post up (ie--the weekly newsletter doesn't trigger contributions), and that can be infrequent. If you're already contributing on Patreon--don't worry, I'm not asking you for more money. And thank you, for being an early supporter!
At this point, I'm honestly conflicted about whether it makes sense for us to continue trying to put out original reporting. And so I'm coming to you, the audience, to tell me what you want to see.    
The Goal The goal of this campaign is to raise $6,000, which basically covers two pieces of original reporting a month for a year. If we don't reach that goal, we'll use whatever money comes in to run for this year.
Right now, we pay $250 per post for regular writers, and $75 per post for guest writers. Your freelance writing folks will tell you, that's higher than most online sites pay. But this site is about economic justice, especially in the new economy. It would be kind of messed up to pay people peanuts. 
All the money that is raised will be used to pay writers. The infrastructure costs, such as they are, will continue to be paid for by me. I don't pay myself for work on the site--I have a good-paying job, and I'd rather spend the money that's raised on funding writers. 
    

If You're Gonna Fail, Fail Fast

 It's certainly possible that all of you out there don't care that much for the original reporting that this site has produced, or share my vision of a site that isn't telling you the same stories you can find in other parts of the labor press. In that case, I'll stop trying to make fetch happen, and just focus on finding you more links about robots, or snarky stories about Uber.

practically doubles.  The money that is raised will go towards paying the very talented graphic designer.  The book covers and almost every page in the books, has incredible artwork and illustrations that brings the story to life!  The remainder of the money will be used to print the books and have them shipped.Tonia and Skylar were extremely proud that they were successful in publishing the first book in 'Fatherless Like Me' series in 2012.  The money that is generated from the book sales -- goes directly back into printing more books.  They really want to complete the 'Fatherless Like Me' book series, but they can sure use a little help!                             ********************





Dedicated to uplifting the spirits of fatherless kids

Tonia and Skylar are very community driven!  They spend most of their
 time engaging with fatherless children, single moms and fatherhood 
programs.  Making appearances, doing book reading and signings at 
various schools, churches and after school programs all over the NY 
Tri-state area.

""We received rave reviews from fans and our first book 'Fatherless Like Me: Growing Up Without Dad' has literally changed lives!  How do we know this?
  We get our data straight from the horses mouth!  We've had moms, dads 
and children, tell us how much they love the book and the characters. 
 We've had single moms breakdown crying because the book was able to 
reach their child in a way that they could not.  Surprisingly, fathers' 
who were estranged from their kids have embraced the book, and 
understand why it's so important to reconnect with their children."" - 
Says, Tonia Grady                                 'FATHERLESS LIKE ME' MAKES THE NEWS!!! We were featured in the Amsterdam News, and we were featured on 
Brooklyn Independent Television's Neighborhood Beat show (video clip at 
top).

More about Tonia Grady....




Ms. Grady, also known as Gradygirl, is an entrepreneur, television producer, independent filmmaker and author.  In 2007, Tonia produced and directed a independent documentary film titled, ""Man-Up: The Exploration of a Fatherless Nation"".  Ms. Grady is recognized as a pioneer in the fatherhood movement because of her film, Man-Up was the first of its kind. The film was very well received, and earned Tonia many awards and accolades.  Because Ms. Grady is so passionate about her work of connect broken families and helping fatherless children; She took her film on the road with a 10-city tour, so she could be up close and personal with her viewing audience.  This move proved to be priceless and helped Man-Up documentary to become a huge underground phenomenon!

In order to achieve this project in such a small timeframe we ask the support of all those who appreciate our work. Even the smallest contribution will be priceless to us!


TO OUR SUPPORTERS
 Come attestato di gratitudine, ogni donatore che vorrà supportarci verrà accreditato come produttore nei 5 numeri della rivista (a meno che non preferisca rimanere anonimo). A coloro che doneranno più di 150 euro (circa 170 dollari) verrà inoltre inviata l’esclusiva Polo tecnica dry-tech “I love Terre di Confine Magazine"".
 Unless they prefer to remain anonymous, our supporters will be credited as producers and their names mentioned in the five issues to be released. As a thank-you gesture, those who will contribute with 170 Dollars or more will also be rewarded with our exclusive dry-tech polo shirt “I love Terre di Confine Magazine"".

FIT FOR JOY BRAZIL  FIT FOR JOY  IN FRANCE""To follow the heart is an adventure of living a life that has been there for you all along.""When my heart felt like leaving New York to go somewhere else to do some rewriting and editing for Fit for Joy I sent a message to many of my friends all over the world. One of the first replies I got within minutes read:  ""Yes and yes, you can stay in my house in Paris for as long as need to work on your book. My lovely friend ANA FREN has made my journey of writing my first book as spiritual and interesting as it could be!! Thank you again and again....!! :)""WE CAN'T UNITE THAT WHICH WAS NEVER APART.""For someone who has been listening to the heart in health and love for all my life, to conclude the final pages of Fit for Joy in The City of Love and Lights, could just be a natural path, but beyond my wildest dreams!! The enchanting and transcendent romantic atmosphere of Paris will mark my journey as an author that will be reflected on the pages of this book.Life is about the adventure of finding out who we really are. We must go where ever the heart takes us. Before landing in the City of Love and Lights, I made many other stops. The story I tell  will take you with me to all the cities of life I have been to. There is a marvelous and mysterious feeling that Fit for Joy has been carried and written within my being throughout life. It was born in New York, will be raised in France to become a citizen of the world! What is not to LOVE about life?!!! :)I'll be in France from October 15th, 2016 to January 15th, 2017.

<p><strong><i>It is time to turn fiction into reality</i></strong></p>
<p>From the age of 8, I declared myself a lover of letters and wrote my first poems to my mother. Over time I have accumulated many texts between poetry, novel, and theater. I know that with your support my texts will see the light to become the texts of all. I invite you to merge in my universe, and to know my story.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>SUMMARY</u></strong></p>
<p>My name is Reinaldo del Orbe, I am an actor, and a writer who won honorable mentions in international literature contests. But the most important thing is that I own a fantastic universe that I encourage to share. That universe has found refuge in the letters, those that you want to and you will read</p>
<p>In this campaign I want to present my book: ""Ruido de Corazón"", in which I dare to mix the theater with fantasy, creating a fantastic literature story that I am sure will touch you when you read it. This story has love, hate, romance, and why not? A little vengeance to give the subject seasoning. You will encounter fantastic beings, magical islands, and time games.</p>
<p>Do you want to know why you should support me? Because you are an indispensable part of this project. With your collaboration, the child who began to write will become an adult and will join the world of letters. Not only will you be sponsoring a book project, but a lifelong dream.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Kara Landhuis. I am a freelance writer and graphic designer. I was introduced to the concept of a ""meet cute"" in one of my favorite romantic comedies, The Holiday. I've always found it such a charming idea. I was introduced to the concept of ""flash fiction"" in one of my university creative writing courses. I'm an aspiring novelist, but I'm very happy to be creating my first book with the help of dozens of other writers and artists.</p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>
<h3>The Stories</h3>
<p>The submissions that I have received are really fun and diverse. My writers have interpreted the theme with a lot of creativity. Flash fiction is an interesting genre. It seems like it would be easy to write a good story in fewer than 1000 words, but it's actually very difficult. Thus, it is a true joy to read well-written flash fiction. Here is a peek at some of the stories that will be included in this collection: </p>
<ul>
<li>A mail carrier delivers mail to an enchanted swamp</li>
<li>An Occupy Wallstreet protester and a businessman end up in the back of the same police car</li>
<li>A disillusioned clown shares a park bench with a mime</li>
</ul>
<h3>This looks familiar...</h3>
<p>This Campaign is a re-launch. Meet Cute's initial Kickstarter campaign was unsuccessful for a number of reasons. Here's how this campaign is different:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initially, I thought I would need to pay 50 contributors and produce a book that was 150 pages. After reviewing submissions, I found that I would be including fewer stories. Now, I am expecting to pay 30 contributors, and the book will have fewer than 100 pages. Accordingly, my funding goal has been halved.</li>
<li>Kickstarter's ""All or Nothing"" format was not appropriate for this project. If I raise enough support to approach my goal, this project will be completed with the help of personal funds. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What is the money for?</h3>
<p>Obviously, my Kickstarter failed. However, I have reevaluated the needs of the project and believe that this relaunch will be successful. Here is the breakdown of the needs of the campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>$350 - Paying contributors (writers and illustrators)</li>

My name is Kara Landhuis. I am a freelance writer and graphic designer. I was introduced to the concept of a ""meet cute"" in one of my favorite romantic comedies, The Holiday. I've always found it such a charming idea. I was introduced to the concept of ""flash fiction"" in one of my university creative writing courses. I'm an aspiring novelist, but I'm very happy to be creating my first book with the help of dozens of other writers and artists.

The Stories
The submissions that I have received are really fun and diverse. My writers have interpreted the theme with a lot of creativity. Flash fiction is an interesting genre. It seems like it would be easy to write a good story in fewer than 1000 words, but it's actually very difficult. Thus, it is a true joy to read well-written flash fiction. Here is a peek at some of the stories that will be included in this collection: 

A mail carrier delivers mail to an enchanted swamp
An Occupy Wallstreet protester and a businessman end up in the back of the same police car
A disillusioned clown shares a park bench with a mime

This looks familiar...
This Campaign is a re-launch. Meet Cute's initial Kickstarter campaign was unsuccessful for a number of reasons. Here's how this campaign is different:

Initially, I thought I would need to pay 50 contributors and produce a book that was 150 pages. After reviewing submissions, I found that I would be including fewer stories. Now, I am expecting to pay 30 contributors, and the book will have fewer than 100 pages. Accordingly, my funding goal has been halved.
Kickstarter's ""All or Nothing"" format was not appropriate for this project. If I raise enough support to approach my goal, this project will be completed with the help of personal funds. 


What is the money for?
Obviously, my Kickstarter failed. However, I have reevaluated the needs of the project and believe that this relaunch will be successful. Here is the breakdown of the needs of the campaign:

$350 - Paying contributors (writers and illustrators)
$600 - Printing
$400 - Shipping
$150 - Fees & Other

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A new book that explores the connection between mental health + soccer. Through various individual vignettes, the book shows the connection, similarities, and journeys of mental health and how they related to soccer culture.  </p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm a soccer journalist who has dealt with mental health issues personally, so why not combined the two? I want to tell my story and the story of others; I want to show people that they are not alone</p>
<p>So far, the book is funny and poignant, sad and inspiring. Not because of me as a writer, but because of the stories I am being told.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>So I am writing a book, why do I need money? Turns out, publishing costs a lot. Paying proofreaders, buying resources, coffee for interviewees, coffee for me, time, photocopying, printing, postage, paying an artist, These things add up. Plus taking time from other writing works to finish this piece. The cost may look like a lot, but I want to give this project everything, so hopefully you will understand why I need the support. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If one person reads this book and feels better, it will all be worth it. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Telling people's stories is always going to be a challenge, both for person reasons and because I am using someone else's voice. My biggest risk is doing this project justice and representing people to the best of my ability. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You may not be able to contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help. Other ways you can help give to the project:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word</li>
<li>Talk to me if you think you can contribute to the book personally </li>

</div><p>Thank you so much!</p><p>Love and hugs,</p><p>Sonja Cori Missio</p></div>","Short Summary
A new book that explores the connection between mental health + soccer. Through various individual vignettes, the book shows the connection, similarities, and journeys of mental health and how they related to soccer culture.  
About Me
I'm a soccer journalist who has dealt with mental health issues personally, so why not combined the two? I want to tell my story and the story of others; I want to show people that they are not alone
So far, the book is funny and poignant, sad and inspiring. Not because of me as a writer, but because of the stories I am being told.  

What We Need
So I am writing a book, why do I need money? Turns out, publishing costs a lot. Paying proofreaders, buying resources, coffee for interviewees, coffee for me, time, photocopying, printing, postage, paying an artist, These things add up. Plus taking time from other writing works to finish this piece. The cost may look like a lot, but I want to give this project everything, so hopefully you will understand why I need the support. 

The Impact
If one person reads this book and feels better, it will all be worth it. 

Risks & Challenges
Telling people's stories is always going to be a challenge, both for person reasons and because I am using someone else's voice. My biggest risk is doing this project justice and representing people to the best of my ability. 

Other Ways You Can Help
You may not be able to contribute financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help. Other ways you can help give to the project:

Spread the word
Talk to me if you think you can contribute to the book personally 
Tell me if you can help in any other way 

Thank you so much!Love and hugs,Sonja Cori Missio",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>My third grade teacher had a poster with an apple on it that said: Everything I need to know I learned in Kindergarten. In Kindergarten we learn to be safe on the playground. We learn to play house and respect each others' personal space. We learn to share what is most personal to us, like prize toys and big tough feelings. But we’ve come to live in a world where it’s easy to forget what we learned in Kindergarten. It’s from that place that the idea for this Indiegogo publishing project arose.</p>
<p>“All This While F*cking” is an autobiographical memoir written by Kelsey Straight, which is set to be published in connection with this campaign on Valentine’s Day. 50% of the Indiegogo proceeds will go to three different charities sharing thematic connections to the book: Planned Parenthood (<a href=""https://www.plannedparenthood.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.plannedparenthood.org/</a>), Heads Together (<a href=""https://www.headstogether.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.headstogether.org.uk/</a>), and Pronto (<a href=""http://prontointernational.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://prontointernational.org/</a>). Once the book is published, 25% of all profits from actual book sales will also be evenly divided between these three charities, in the form of direct donations and fundraising events designed to raise awareness around the issues at hand.</p>
<p>“All This While F*cking” is a true account of the three years the author spent living in Brooklyn and dating, compulsively, off Tinder. In the process of meeting and sleeping with an impressive diversity of strangers - over 200 dates and 100 one-night-stands - she was ultimately forced to meet and go to bed with herself – first on the page, and then in practice. The uncensored stories included within open the door to an array of personal and mental health issues that might come as a surprise to those closest to the author. But there are things we don’t talk about. It’s difficult to negotiate stigmatic issues into what is “right and normal” when those issues are also integral parts of who we are as human beings.</p>
<p>We have chosen to give a percentage of all profits to charity because art is there to help us. Art is the creation of what we need. In a society where art is valued more for how much money it makes than how many lives it might impact, and thus a world where art is often more commercial than human, it’s increasingly easy to forget this. I’m tired of hearing that my high school classmates have committed suicide. I’m tired of emotional censorship and the number of hearts that lose their way when we trade in compassion for judgment. I am exhausted by our culture of “self,” because it doesn’t work emotionally. Being there for others is the same thing as being there for ourselves. We used to live in packs or ""troops"". Now we live in connected digital profiles. I hope that in talking candidly and honestly about my own issues and experiences, it will give others the permission to do the same, both men and women alike, because at the end of the day, the only difference between us is that which we choose to create. We must choose to create things that bring us together instead of dividing us further. We must remember what we learned in Kindergarten.</p>
</div><div>
<p>So, please donate. It’s not the amount that’s meaningful; it’s act of donating itself. 50% of the Indiegogo profits will go to charitable causes, and the remaining 50% will go to actual expenses arising from the publication of the novel, including manufacturing costs for physical copies, copy-writing services, and marketing geared at raising awareness for both the book and the issues within. If you wish, you may indicate which of the three charities you’d like your donation allocated towards. It will otherwise be divided evenly between the three. The majority of donations will be sent directly to the applicable charity, but a portion of proceeds will also be used in fundraising events for these same issues. Tax receipts will be provided upon request.</p>
<p>Perks include everything from signed copies of the book, to branded <i>All This While F*cking </i>condoms, to Dating &amp; Tinder Survival Guides written by yours truly, to a surprise date-night with a loved one in the city of your choice, to branded t-shirts and boxers, to your name mentioned in the book acknowledging your donation, or perhaps sharing a creative project you might be working on, or including a message to friend you’ve lost touch with. All backers also receive an invite to the launch party for the physical version of the book + any additional invites to fundraising events occurring in connection with the book over the next couple years. The more money we raise, the more fundraising events in different cities there will be.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Here is one reason why.  </h3>

<p>In the darkness of that corner - with three bullies surrounding her, cowering deep behind the sofa, tucking in her stomach – so not to make a sound or breath  -- she closed her eyes for a few moments – and wished that her life were different. </p>
<p>Elena dreamed of becoming a Princess -- living in a castle, with her mother, Carmen and her grandmother, Alma.  In her castle, she saw a gorgeous closet with beautiful dresses, purses and shoes, a softer than air, white, comfy bed with a matching luxurious white desk -- to sit and draw her creations.  She envisioned a big refrigerator filled lots of delicious food – and never to feel hungry or scared again.  Her vision of escape so real, so vivid  -- until she heard the cry of a furry animal – who could not speak.</p>
