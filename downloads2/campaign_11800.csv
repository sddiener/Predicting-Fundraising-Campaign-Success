<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Here's Our Story</span></h3>
<p>Back in 2017 I started writing a comic script. As time went on, I started weaving a novel about past betrayals, loyalty, and friendship, with fighting or dialogue on every page. I wanted to write pulp! 2019 rolled around, and I finally published my first novel. I kept getting a nagging thought in the back of my head, though. I'd done several successful crowdfunding campaigns so far in tabletop, why not comics? </p>

<p>​I contacted Startwo, a creative duo based out of Portugal on the recommendation of my buddy Cirsova (who runs a delightful pulp magazine).

<p><strong><i>Welcome to a comic book as wild and weird as Texas itself:</i></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>  <br/>Howdy folks, I’m Drew Edwards and ya'll know me as the writer/creator of the long running indie comic hit, Halloween Man. While, I've been in the funny book biz for quite some time, this project is one that is particularly special to me.  Because this time I'm bringing together a creative team that is completely comprised of talent from right here in Austin, Texas.   People I'm proud to work with and proud to call friends. </li>

<li>I think you'll find this comic very different from even the other Halloween Man comics I've published in the past.  The stories contained within range from the personal to the comedic to the lurid.  They're stories that speak to me both as a writer and as someone who loves to collaborate with artists.   Because they were all tailored directly to the artist's requests of things they'd like to draw.   This approach means these stories will a different place within Halloween Man canon and have a unique feel.</li>
<li>  <br/>Texas has also always had a special place in Halloween Man lore, because I'm a child of the lone star state.  As a kid, I always wanted there to be superhero adventures that look place in Texas. The creation of Halloween Man's hometown of Solar City, TX grew out of wild summertime story sharing telling sessions I used to share with my twin brother on our boat dock on Possum Kingdom Lake.  It's only natural that as an adult, that Texas pride would drive me to create this comic, a comic completely rooted in Austin and its artistic talent. So, I could showcase the many wonderful people who live and work in this city. </li>

<p>Hallo! Mein Name ist Filip und ich bin studierter Illustrator und Animator. Ich bin 31 Jahre alt und arbeite als Freiberufler in Deutschland.</p>
<p>Ich habe von 2011 bis 2020 Illustration und Animation an der Kunsthochschule Kassel studiert. Als Beispiel ist hier mein Abschlussprojekt STROMLAND. Ein detailliertes Animatic zu einem 24-minütigen animierten Kurzfilm, den ich über das Erwachsenwerden eines Jungen erstellt habe. Der Film enthält biografische Elemente aus meiner Familiengeschichte.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.tinyurl.com/stromland-animatic-final"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.tinyurl.com/stromland-animatic-final</a></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622070321/dqkgsix4sodjdhhvvevr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Bei dieser Kampagne geht es um mein neuestes Projekt ""<strong>Weird World Hero Book</strong>"" (Arbeitstitel). Es wird ein kleines digitales Artbook mit Illustrationen von seltsamen Charakteren aus einer meiner seltsamen Fantasiewelten sein. Es wird etwa 50 von mir erfundene und illustrierte Charaktere enthalten. Zusätzlich wird jeder Charakter einen kurzen Flavor-Text auf Englisch über sein Leben, seine Fähigkeiten oder andere interessante Details bekommen.</p>
<p><u>Das Buch wird eher an ein erwachsenes Publikum gerichtet sein</u>, da es Zeichnungen enthalten wird, die Gewalt und teils nicht-explizite Nacktheit darstellen. Ich möchte Männer, Frauen und andere Kreaturen auf Abenteuer, in oder nach Kämpfen und in gewagten und körperbetonten Posen zeigen. <i>Ich werde keine Zeichnungen erstellen, die nur Nacktheit oder Brutalität um der Nacktheit oder Brutalität willen zeigen, weil ich das zu langweilig finde.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622070817/numhal24cd4q24er0ox3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Dies Artbook wäre mein erstes selbstgemachtes Buch mit eigenen Illustrationen. Ich denke, die Welt könnte daran interessiert sein, wie schräg und faszinierend einige meiner Helden tatsächlich sein können.</p>
<p><u>Danach würde ich das Buch gerne drucken lassen und verkaufen</u>. Das hängt allerdings stark davon ab, wie viele Leute sich für das Buch interessieren und wie viel vom Finanzierungsziel erreicht wird. Das wird ein Teil des nächsten Produktionsschritts sein und ist noch nicht Teil dieser Kampagne.<br/>Da Indiegogo hauptsächlich eine amerikanische Website ist und der Versand einzelner Exemplare an einzelne Adressen in den USA von Deutschland aus sehr kostspielig ist, kann es mir noch nicht leisten dieses Artbook zu drucken und international zu versenden. Für deutsche Unterstützer rechne ich damit, dass es möglich sein wird, das Buch nach der Kampagne für einen kleinen Aufpreis in gedruckter Form zu bekommen. Aber das hängt ganz davon ab, wie viele Leute ein gedrucktes Exemplar haben wollen. Da das digitale Artbook in Schwarz, Weiß und wahrscheinlich Grautönen sein wird, wird es auch auf E-Readern gut lesbar sein :)</p>

<p>Im Moment habe ich so wenig Geld, dass ich jeden Monat befürchte, meine Miete nicht bezahlen zu können. Außerdem habe ich einen hohen Schuldenberg durch mein Studium. Aber ich möchte nicht nur um Geld bitten. Ich möchte den Menschen, die mir helfen wollen, etwas von meinem Zeichentalent zurückgeben. Das ist der Punkt, an dem <i><strong>Ihr</strong></i> die Bühne betretet. Euer finanzieller Beitrag wird mir helfen, meine Miete zu bezahlen, aber auch einen Bildband mit schönen Zeichnungen zu produzieren, in den Ihr dann eintauchen können.</p>

<p>Die Erstellung dieses kleinen Buches wird einige Zeit in Anspruch nehmen.<br/>- Ich plane 50 Charaktere in schwarz-weiß und Grautönen zu entwickeln und zu illustrieren.<br/>- Auch plane ich für jeden Charakter einen kleinen Flavor-Text zu schreiben, der seine Person, sein Leben, seine Besitztümer, seine Fähigkeiten oder andere interessante Dinge beschreibt.<br/>- Schließlich werde ich das kleine Buch layouten müssen, um es für den Druck vorzubereiten.</p>
<p>Für jede Zeichnung werde ich etwa 8 Stunden Arbeit benötigen, bis sie fertig und einzigartig ist. Das macht 50 x 8 Stunden = 400 Stunden Zeichnen.<br/>Für jeden Flavor-Text werde ich bis zu 1 Stunde brauchen, um ein interessantes, vielleicht ein wenig humorvolles und korrekturgelesenes Stück zu bekommen. Das macht 50 Stunden für das Schreiben.<br/>Schließlich wird es noch einmal 10 Stunden Arbeit erfordern, alles zu layouten, um es druckfähig zu machen.</p>
<p>Insgesamt sind das 460 Stunden Arbeit. Ich möchte mein Finanzierungsziel auf 4.600€ (~5.400$) setzen, was mir 10€ pro Arbeitsstunde einbringen würde.</p>

<p>Die Perks, die ich erstellt habe, reichen von winzigen Beteiligungen bis hin zu großen Schritten, die Ihnen die Chance geben, an meinem kleinen Artbook mitzugestalten.

<p>Das <strong>Weird World Hero Book</strong> kann für jeden wertvoll sein. Ich selbst liebe Fantasy und Science-Fiction vor allem wegen ihrer Kraft, meine Gedanken weg von den Problemen des realen Lebens und hin zu fiktionalen Ereignissen und Welten zu lenken, in denen ich träumen und Stress loslassen kann, während meine Vorstellungskraft positiv angeregt wird.</p>
<p>Ich möchte, dass die Zeichnungen und kurzen Texte meines winzigen Buches Euch an die Hand nehmen, Euch zu einem riesigen goldenen Tor mit einem Schlüsselloch von der Größe Eures Kopfes führen und Euch hindurch in eine andere Welt blicken lassen, die vor Abenteuern und seltsamen, faszinierenden Dingen nur so strotzt. Ich möchte, dass mein kleines Buch Euch dazu bringt, es viele Male durchzuschmökern und immer wieder neue Details zu finden. Ich möchte, dass es Euch entspannt und gleichzeitig inspiriert.</p>
<p>Das <strong>Weird World Hero Book</strong> kann aber auch einen viel praktischeren Nutzen haben. Wenn Du - <i>wie ich und viele andere Leute heute</i> - ein Fan von Tabletop-Rollenspielen bist und vielleicht Deine eigenen Rollenspielkampagnen leitest, kann mein Buch eine Inspiration für Charaktere, Schurken und Helden in Deiner eigenen Fantasy-Welt sein. Wäre es nicht toll, wenn Deine und meine Fantasy-Welt sich gegenseitig beeinflussen könnten? Ich fände es super!</p>

<p>Vielleicht arbeite ich in der Zwischenzeit auch an anderen Aufträgen. Das wiederum lässt mir nicht immer Zeit, für das <strong>Weird World Hero Book</strong> zu zeichnen. Ich zeichne allerdings schon, seit ich 8 Jahre alt bin. Und ich liebe es, mich zurückzulehnen, mit einer Tasse Tee zu entspannen und abends oder nachts zu zeichnen, wenn die Welt ruhiger und die Ablenkungen immer weniger werden.</p>
<p>Insgesamt sollte es etwa 2 Monate dauern, bis das ganze Buch fertig ist. Bei Problemen, die ich noch nicht sehen und nicht berechnen kann, werde ich dem Buch 3 Monate geben, um sicher fertig zu werden.</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Filip and I am a professional illustrator and animator. I am 31 years old and work as a freelancer in Germany.</p>

<p>This would be my first ever selfmade book with my own illustrations. I think the world might be interested in how weird and intriguing some of my heroes can actually be.</p>
<p><strong>Afterwards I would love to get the book printed</strong> and sell it. That depends hugely on the amount of people interested in the book, though, and how much of the funding goal is reached. That will be part of the next step of production and is not yet part of this campaign.<br/>As Indiegogo is mainly an american website and shipping single copies to individual addresses in the U.S. from Germany is very costly. I'm not able yet to afford printing this art book and shipping it internationally. For German backers I expect it to be possible to get the book after the campaign for a little extra cost in printed form. But that completely depends on the amount of people wanting a printed copy.<br/>As the digital art book will be in black, white and probably graytones, it will be readable perfectly on e-readers. :)</p>

<p>At the moment I have so little money that I fear not being able to pay my rent every month. Additionally I'm looking at a big amount of debt from my studies.

<p>If only a part of the funding goal is reached, the book could just become smaller. Anything from 25 drawings upwards instead of the whole 50 is possible.

<p>The Weird World Hero Book can be valuable to absolutely anybody. I myself love fantasy and science fiction especially for their power to direct my thoughts away from real life problems and towards fictional events and worlds, where I can dream and let go of stress, while being positively stimulated in my imagination.</p>
<p>I want the drawings and short texts of my tiny book to take you by the hand, guide you to a huge golden gate with a keyhole the size of your head and let you look through it into another world that thrives with adventures and weird, fascinating things. I want my tiny book to make you read it many times and always find new details. I want it to relax and inspire you at the same time.</p>
<p>The Weird World Hero Book can also have a much more practical use. If you are - like myself and many other people today - a fan of tabletop roleplaying and maybe leading your own roleplaying campaigns sometimes my book can be an inspiration for characters, villains and heroes in your own fantasy world. Wouldn't it be great if your fantasy world and mine could affect each other? I'd absolutely love it!</p>

<p>I might also work on other jobs in the meantime. That again won't always leave me time to draw for the Weird World Hero Book. I draw since I am 8 years old now, though. And I love to sit back, relax with a cup of tea and draw at night, when the world calms down and the distractions become less and less.</p>
<p>In total it should take around 2 months to finish the whole book. Regarding problems I'm not able to see yet and can't calculate I will give the book 3 months to be finished safely.</p>
<p>I'm certain I'll find enough time to finish the book until November 2021.</p>

Hallo! Mein Name ist Filip und ich bin studierter Illustrator und Animator. Ich bin 31 Jahre alt und arbeite als Freiberufler in Deutschland.
Ich habe von 2011 bis 2020 Illustration und Animation an der Kunsthochschule Kassel studiert. Als Beispiel ist hier mein Abschlussprojekt STROMLAND. Ein detailliertes Animatic zu einem 24-minütigen animierten Kurzfilm, den ich über das Erwachsenwerden eines Jungen erstellt habe. Der Film enthält biografische Elemente aus meiner Familiengeschichte.
www.tinyurl.com/stromland-animatic-final
 

Bei dieser Kampagne geht es um mein neuestes Projekt ""Weird World Hero Book"" (Arbeitstitel). Es wird ein kleines digitales Artbook mit Illustrationen von seltsamen Charakteren aus einer meiner seltsamen Fantasiewelten sein. Es wird etwa 50 von mir erfundene und illustrierte Charaktere enthalten. Zusätzlich wird jeder Charakter einen kurzen Flavor-Text auf Englisch über sein Leben, seine Fähigkeiten oder andere interessante Details bekommen.
Das Buch wird eher an ein erwachsenes Publikum gerichtet sein, da es Zeichnungen enthalten wird, die Gewalt und teils nicht-explizite Nacktheit darstellen. Ich möchte Männer, Frauen und andere Kreaturen auf Abenteuer, in oder nach Kämpfen und in gewagten und körperbetonten Posen zeigen. Ich werde keine Zeichnungen erstellen, die nur Nacktheit oder Brutalität um der Nacktheit oder Brutalität willen zeigen, weil ich das zu langweilig finde.

Dies Artbook wäre mein erstes selbstgemachtes Buch mit eigenen Illustrationen. Ich denke, die Welt könnte daran interessiert sein, wie schräg und faszinierend einige meiner Helden tatsächlich sein können.
Danach würde ich das Buch gerne drucken lassen und verkaufen. Das hängt allerdings stark davon ab, wie viele Leute sich für das Buch interessieren und wie viel vom Finanzierungsziel erreicht wird. Das wird ein Teil des nächsten Produktionsschritts sein und ist noch nicht Teil dieser Kampagne.Da Indiegogo hauptsächlich eine amerikanische Website ist und der Versand einzelner Exemplare an einzelne Adressen in den USA von Deutschland aus sehr kostspielig ist, kann es mir noch nicht leisten dieses Artbook zu drucken und international zu versenden. Für deutsche Unterstützer rechne ich damit, dass es möglich sein wird, das Buch nach der Kampagne für einen kleinen Aufpreis in gedruckter Form zu bekommen. Aber das hängt ganz davon ab, wie viele Leute ein gedrucktes Exemplar haben wollen. Da das digitale Artbook in Schwarz, Weiß und wahrscheinlich Grautönen sein wird, wird es auch auf E-Readern gut lesbar sein :)
DEUTSCHE BACKER DES SAGE-PERKS ERHALTEN DAS WEIRD WORLD HERO BOOK VORAUSSICHTLICH OHNE AUFPREIS IN GEDRUCKTER FORM!!!
 

Im Moment habe ich so wenig Geld, dass ich jeden Monat befürchte, meine Miete nicht bezahlen zu können. Außerdem habe ich einen hohen Schuldenberg durch mein Studium. Aber ich möchte nicht nur um Geld bitten. Ich möchte den Menschen, die mir helfen wollen, etwas von meinem Zeichentalent zurückgeben. Das ist der Punkt, an dem Ihr die Bühne betretet. Euer finanzieller Beitrag wird mir helfen, meine Miete zu bezahlen, aber auch einen Bildband mit schönen Zeichnungen zu produzieren, in den Ihr dann eintauchen können.

Smaller perks contain the book as a pdf or single digital versions of one of the characters signed by me.
Of course every backer will be named in the book. 

 

If only a part of the funding goal is reached, the book could just become smaller. Anything from 25 drawings upwards instead of the whole 50 is possible. If the funding only reaches a very small part of the whole goal, your contribution will help a poor freelancer artist in Germany survive hard times and get on his feet. (That'd be me :) )
 


The Weird World Hero Book can be valuable to absolutely anybody. I myself love fantasy and science fiction especially for their power to direct my thoughts away from real life problems and towards fictional events and worlds, where I can dream and let go of stress, while being positively stimulated in my imagination.
I want the drawings and short texts of my tiny book to take you by the hand, guide you to a huge golden gate with a keyhole the size of your head and let you look through it into another world that thrives with adventures and weird, fascinating things. I want my tiny book to make you read it many times and always find new details. I want it to relax and inspire you at the same time.
The Weird World Hero Book can also have a much more practical use. If you are - like myself and many other people today - a fan of tabletop roleplaying and maybe leading your own roleplaying campaigns sometimes my book can be an inspiration for characters, villains and heroes in your own fantasy world. Wouldn't it be great if your fantasy world and mine could affect each other? I'd absolutely love it!

 


I might also work on other jobs in the meantime. That again won't always leave me time to draw for the Weird World Hero Book. I draw since I am 8 years old now, though. And I love to sit back, relax with a cup of tea and draw at night, when the world calms down and the distractions become less and less.
In total it should take around 2 months to finish the whole book. Regarding problems I'm not able to see yet and can't calculate I will give the book 3 months to be finished safely.
I'm certain I'll find enough time to finish the book until November 2021.
 


If you don't have a credit card or Google Pay or Apple Pay, then contact me directly via my profile above. We can also set up another form of financial support such as PayPal, which will of course give you the same perk you chose.
If you can't afford to help me financially, show my campaign to your family members and friends who might be interested. People spend hundreds on fantasy comics, sci-fi movies, action videogames and other great digital content all the time. Maybe they'd like to follow the creation of a little book filled with weird fantasy heores, too?! Who knows?
What I definitely know is that I'll greatly appreciate it. :) Thank you!

<p>As you can guess from the title, NED is not the name of a person you'd expect to be the ruler of a Pit in the bowels of Hell. (Actually, I'm not sure I want him near the bowels of anything.)

But in this new, original 144 page graphic novel written and drawn by me, I don't give him a choice.</p>

<p>It's a funny (to us) and frightening (especially to him) story of an average guy discovering the world is so much stranger than he thought, and his family (himself included) are way more connected to the darker, scarier side of reality than he knew or would ever ever want.

<p>This first volume (the story does continue) runs over 130 pages of story; as I draw, I keep adding pages, letting scenes breathe so the page count is not set in stone. There's a great thing about creator-owned and Crowd-funding: No editor saying ""Can you have this five pages fit into three, even though it screws up the storytelling and kills the gags and any suspense?"" And there'll be extras of course, like behind the scenes goodies; of course the THANK YOU page listing the name of every backer; and guest pin-ups by Mike McKone, Tom Raney, Matt Clark, Alan Davis and others to be announced.

<p><strong>Welcome Aboard The Richest Treasure Ship You’ve Never Heard Of</strong></p>
<p>From 1565 till 1815, THE single-richest treasure-ship a pirate could dream of taking as a prize was <i>THE MANILA GALLEON</i>.</p>

<h3>What We're About In These Waters:</h3>
<p>Our campaign goals are simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-Publish <strong>Manila #1 </strong>(using a USA-based Printer!), in which our characters are introduced and face their first challenges (a yacht race in Manila Bay and a Dutch attack), digitally and in-print, for our backers.</li>
<li>Give our <strong>Mighty Artist</strong> a head-start on drawing <strong>Manila #2</strong>, in which the plot thickens and THE GALLEON arrives in-port...</li>
<li>Create an excited <strong>Crew of Readers</strong> to follow the MANILA storyline to its conclusion as we self-publish new Issues on a regular basis.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of how your precious Booty gets paid-out:</p>

<h3>A Worthy Maiden Voyage...</h3>
<p>As you might have deduced, MANILA does not take place in the Caribbean, nor in Old Europe. Rather, it's a story of East and West colliding in the beautiful and treacherous waters of the Philippine and South China Seas. It's something of a fish-story, larger-than-life, as we fans of pirate tales prefer, BUT it's also based on the very real historical events of the mid-17th century, in which the whole world scrambled and fought for a piece of the East Indies, and all the riches pouring out of that region.</p>
<p>MANILA is a tale in which our intrepid heroes are primarily FROM East Asia, and in which their main antagonists are from Spain (the colonial overlords of Manila and its environs) and The Dutch East India Company (a rising maritime power, having ruthlessly established a nutmeg monopoly and hungering for more). </p>
<p>The Crew executing the Galleon heist includes:</p>

</div></div>","Welcome Aboard The Richest Treasure Ship You’ve Never Heard Of
From 1565 till 1815, THE single-richest treasure-ship a pirate could dream of taking as a prize was THE MANILA GALLEON.
“…but what is THE MANILA GALLEON?” you may ask. Click on our above video intro and you’ll get the idea. [ also, follow us on Facebook and Instagram @ManilaComic ]
 
Who We Are:

Eugene Park (artist) – creator/writer/artist of the Red Roger comic, independent illustrator, and pirate lore, cartoon, and film enthusiast.  IGG @eugeneypark / @red_roger_official_page
http://Eypark0704.myportfolio.com
Paul Suda (writer) - horseman/swordsman you may have seen on Deadliest Warrior, Full Metal Jousting, Gamology’s Experts React series, and producer/fight designer of Tower of Joy – A Game of Thrones FanFilm.  IGG @actorpaulsuda

What We're About In These Waters:
Our campaign goals are simple:

Self-Publish Manila #1 (using a USA-based Printer!), in which our characters are introduced and face their first challenges (a yacht race in Manila Bay and a Dutch attack), digitally and in-print, for our backers.
Give our Mighty Artist a head-start on drawing Manila #2, in which the plot thickens and THE GALLEON arrives in-port...
Create an excited Crew of Readers to follow the MANILA storyline to its conclusion as we self-publish new Issues on a regular basis.

 
Here's a breakdown of how your precious Booty gets paid-out:

 

A Worthy Maiden Voyage...
As you might have deduced, MANILA does not take place in the Caribbean, nor in Old Europe. Rather, it's a story of East and West colliding in the beautiful and treacherous waters of the Philippine and South China Seas. It's something of a fish-story, larger-than-life, as we fans of pirate tales prefer, BUT it's also based on the very real historical events of the mid-17th century, in which the whole world scrambled and fought for a piece of the East Indies, and all the riches pouring out of that region.
MANILA is a tale in which our intrepid heroes are primarily FROM East Asia, and in which their main antagonists are from Spain (the colonial overlords of Manila and its environs) and The Dutch East India Company (a rising maritime power, having ruthlessly established a nutmeg monopoly and hungering for more). 
The Crew executing the Galleon heist includes:

Yang - Taiwanese shipwright, Architect of THE PLAN

Gan - Yang's son, Taiwanese-Malay boat Skipper

Imugi - Korean crack-shot, Master Gunner

Makisig (""Phil"") - tribal Filipino highlander, Top-Man 

Hu - Chinese accountant serving the Ming consul, Purser

Chesa - Javanese-German adventuress, Thief

Tala - Filipina Manila-dwelling tavern-owner, Quartermaster

Bunji - Japanese Ronin

Jesus - Mexican-Spanish Forger

Houghtalen - Dutch-American Bosun


As fun as the classic West Indies setting can be for a pirate heist, we thought you might enjoy a change of scenery, a fresh take on high-seas Adventure, as well as more than one cultural reaction to European incursions in Asia.

When she finally indulges her own passions, they nearly destroy her. While tutoring the childlike Princess Melina, Jhana falls hopelessly in love with the dark, visiting princess Edris. Their torrid affair ends with the announcement of a political engagement between Edris and Melina, leaving Jhana devastated and suicidal. Though planning to end her misery on their wedding day, a visit with her benefactor Vana opens her eyes to the devastation caused by Queen Leith. Rather than end her life, she devotes it to overthrowing the Queen and the house of her former lover.</p><p><strong>Kendan</strong>: One of Jhana’s pupils, Kendan is good-hearted merchild with an extreme lack of focus, often seemingly unaware of what’s right in front of her. Rather than pay attention in class, she is forever running off to watch the scintillating colors of the rainbow fish. Is she a hopeless dreamer, addicted to shiny surfaces, ADD or all three? In any case, she’s present enough to remind her teacher to bid farewell to a benefactor, shaking Jhana from her own malaise.</p><p><strong>Gidri</strong>: Divine herald of Kalise, Gidri is tasked with rousing the creatures of the sea. The sadness of knowing all living things must die keeps her from accomplishing her goal. Enraged, Kalise gives her gills and fins, and casts her from his presence. Though her task is finally completed, she remains removed from her divine source. To the mermaids, she is a goddess in her own right, and an example to live by. Through worship they honor her love and sacrifice.</p><p><strong>Melina</strong>: Naïve, childlike daughter of Queen Leith, ruler of Loria, Melina loves both Jhana and Edris with an open heart. Unaware of their affair, her engagement to Edris delights her. Unaware of politics, her kidnapping by the rebels only confuses her.</p><p><strong>Edris</strong>: Impulsive daughter of Sandra’s Queen Vanthi, blackfish of the family, Edris loves the tutor Jhana with a passion. At the same time, she’s tired of living in the long shadow cast by her more noble sister, Elexa. When her mother betroths her to the naïve young Melina for political reasons, she turns her back on Jhana and obeys, only to find herself in a battle for the realm, on the opposite side of her former.</p><p><strong>Vava</strong>: A kindly older mermaid who took Jhana in when her affair with Edris ended and she was forced to leave the palace. It’s only when the compassionate Vava and her family are forced to leave Loria that Jhana sees firsthand the cruelty of Leith’s armies.</p><p><strong>Leith the Shark Queen</strong>: Everyone has heard the rumor that Loria’s ambitious ruler Leith killed her own mother to speed her ascension to the throne. Far fewer know that Loria is also a changeling, able to transform a deadly killer. As new leader, the Shark Queen’s cruelty begat rebellion, her harsh military response has destroyed the realm’s resources and forced the starving to flee in droves. Marrying her daughter Melina to Edris of Palagia, ties her family to the ocean’s most powerful army, leaving the other realms wondering who she’ll seek to conquer next.</p><p><strong>Thessa</strong>: Queen of Rhanur, the compassionate Thessa risks attack when she opens her borders to Loria’s starving fugitives. If Queen Leith believes her in league with the rebels, Rhanur may be her next target. Though supporting the rebel cause, Thessa not only has a far weaker military, she and her wife Ydim have a child on the way.</p><p><strong>Ydim</strong>:  Wife of Thessa, Queen of Rhanur, Ydim is pregnant with their first child, who will be heir to the throne – if the realm survives. Though she loves and respects her queen, the more pragmatic Ydim fears her too-kind wife will bring the Shark-queen’s wrath down on their smaller realm when she opens their borders to Loria’s starving fugitives.</p><p><strong>Loria</strong>: The undersea realm of Loria is second only to Palagia in size and strength. Once the gem of the seas, the cruel reign of Leith, the Shark Queen led to rebellion. The harsh military response collapsed the civil order, devastated their resources and led to a massive exodus of starving refugees. Rather than help her people, Leith is more interested in joining her family to Palagia by marriage. When she succeeds, neutralizing her biggest threat, it seems only a matter of time before the army shifts from crushing rebels to conquering new territory.</p><p><strong>Pelagia</strong>: With the most powerful military under the waves, whither Pelagia turns, so goes the undersea world. Only Loria’s army, if it joined with just one other realm, might challenge her. Some believe Loria’s recent aggressions led Pelagia’s Queen to agree to joining the ruling families through the marriage of her daughter Edris to Loria’s Princess Melina.</p><p><strong>Gordova</strong>: Gordova, capital of Loria, holds the grand palace of the vicious Queen Leith, where she lives with her conniving concubine, the Lady Vita, and her naïve, child-like daughter Melina. Once-glorious, thanks to Leith’s harsh treatment of the rebels, the city is now by plagued by famine and a decaying social order. The citizens live in fear, the starving flee in droves.</p><p><strong>Rhanur</strong>: A vulnerable neighbor to the newly militant Loria, the peaceful Rhanur has opened its borders to the starving refugees. Its own resources strained, should it prove to harbor the rebels Loria wants to destroy, it may swiftly become Queen Leith’s next target. When princess Melina is kidnapped and Loria’s armies on the move, the time has come for Rhanur to act.</p><p><strong>Vanthi</strong>: Queen of Sandar, the most powerful undersea realm, Vanthi is also mother to Edris, the family’s impulsive blackfish, and the noble Elexa, hero to the people. When Elexa returns from a quest suffering a strange madness, a cloud hands over the realm. With the powerful Loria stretching its muscles, Vanthi arranges a marriage between Edris and Loria’s Princess Melina, perhaps hoping to stave off an attack from her only military rival.</p><p><strong>Elexa</strong>: Daughter to Vanthi, princess of Pelagia, the epic feats of the brave, noble Elexa have set an example throughout the seas. When she returns from a dangerous quest suffering a strange madness, it makes the realm seem weaker. Family blackfish Edris becomes the only viable heir, and a pawn in a complex political game.</p><p><strong>Gimaine</strong>: Jester and gadfly to more than one queen, Gimaine’s brash, scathing tongue has nearly been cut out by irate royalty on many occasions. At the same time, had the old Queen of Loria heeded her warnings, she might still be alive, and her ambitious daughter not dragging the whole of the watery world into war. Much as Gimaine prefers to stand outside the ocean’s madness and observe with clever quips, Leith’s cruelty leads even the fool to take a stand – with the rebels.</p><p><strong>Madja</strong>:  Queen of Denor, while recognizing the danger of Leith’s aggression, Madja clings to what she knows best, a diplomatic solution. War is to be avoided at all costs, not only because of the loss of life, but because Denor’s army is hardly huge. Her concern rises when Edris and Melina are married, moreso when rebels kidnap Loria’s princess. It’s only when she’s goaded by Rhaur’s Queen Thessa that she feels her options have run out, and she must risk her people to take a stand against the Shark Queen.</p><p><strong>Grumia</strong>: Although one of the smaller realms, wealthy Grumia is known as the cultural center of the seas. What it lacks in numbers it makes up for in expertise, luxury and advanced weaponry. When Queen Barra invites the newlywed Edris and Melina to enjoy their honeymoon in Grumia’s lush environs, it’s taken as a signal of her decision to support the Shark Queen.</p><p><strong>Barra</strong>: The calculating Queen of Grumia, cultural center of the seas, Barra carefully tracks the shifting military powers. When Loria is joined to the powerful Pelagia in marriage, Barra chooses to ally with the cruel Queen Leith rather than face her wrath. Her decision, subtly announced at the wedding, rattles the other realms, forcing them to choose sides, or fall like dominoes.</p><p><strong>Sandar</strong>: Largest and most powerful of the undersea realms, Sandar’s standing army could easily squash any of the other realms. Only the newly aggressive Loria might prove a challenge – but when the two houses are joined by marriage, what could possibly stand in their way?</p><p><strong>Shere</strong>: Hopelessly cheery even in these dark times, Shere continues to run one of the few remaining inns on the outskirts of Loria. Though it doubles as a rebel base, despite the danger, the idealist rebel still adheres to the old rules of hospitality. Otherwise, she figures, they’re just as bad as Leith. Her kindness pays off when she allows Jhana inside, unwittingly giving the rebellion their newest, and perhaps most key, member.</p><p><strong>Rinko</strong>:  Curt, steely Rinko is a veteran, jaded by war and the loss of her comrades. Though lending her blade to the rebels, strategy makes her impatient, and she bristles at any command. Will her hot temper help or destroy their chances at success?</p><p><strong>Anaya</strong>: Terribly strong, and unwaveringly loyal to the rebel cause, Anaya is a rare changeling, able to puff her body up like a blowfish with terrifying results. Using her powerful arms to draw foes into her body and incapacitate them, she can likely defeat any single enemy.</p><p><strong>Abyssinia</strong>: Her body multi-colored and translucent, her mind opaque even to those who know her best, Abyssinia is a stranger in a strange land. Though she sides with the rebels, her motives remain as cryptic as her origins and her odd way of talking that makes her seem an alien species.</p><p><strong>Itsar</strong>: Leader of a ragtag rebel team, Itsar is a born strategist. Now, dogged on all sides by Leith’s soldiers, the clever mind that never failed her now struggles just to keep them alive. In a final, desperate effort to turn the tide, Istar decides on a desperate gambit – the kidnapping of princess Melina. The effort is a success, but now the whole of the Queen’s armies have one goal; finding and destroying them. If she makes it to neighboring Rhanur with her prize, it means the beginning of a war. If not, death.</p><p><strong>Vita</strong>: Concubine to Queen Leith, the Lady Vita’s own aspirations are kept in check by the fear of her lover. Eagerly taking the throne whenever the queen is away, she revels in the power, only to meekly surrendering it whenever her sadistic paramour returns.</p><p><strong>General Sot</strong>: Leader of Leith’s ruthless armies, once honored as a great military mind, General Sot now lives on a razor’s edge. Should she ever fail the queen, regardless of her stature or her experience, her life would be forfeit.</p><p><strong>Denor</strong>: Though one of the smaller realms, Denor has survived and thrived thanks to the clever diplomatic machinations of its calculating Queen, Madja. But in war, one cannot be a friend to all, and whose side they take, for good or ill, will likely decide Denor’s survival.</p><p><strong>The Three:</strong> Capable of rare magic, the Mer-crones known as The Three act as a means of instant communication. Through them, voice and image instantly travels the leagues, allowing the rich and the royal to speak with one another as if they were next to each other.</p><p><strong>Chaka the Joker</strong>:  One of four gods whose boredom creates the world, the jovial Chaka embodies the primal force of earth. His joyful mirth makes manifest all mountains, plains and canyons. With Raden, he brings lava, with Kalise, the swamps, with Aitor fertile soil.</p><p><strong>Raden the Furious</strong>:  One of four gods whose boredom creates the world, the explosive Raden embodies the primal force of fire. His rage brings flame, volcano and lightning into being. With Chaka, he brings lava, with Kalise, steam, with Aitor, hurricanes.</p><p><strong>Kalise the Wailer</strong>: One of four gods whose boredom creates the world, the emotional Kalise is the embodiment of the primal force of water. His tears bring the seas, lakes and rivers. With Chaka he brings the swamps, with Raden, steam, with Aitor, the rain.</p><p><strong>Aitor the Dreamer</strong>: One of four gods whose boredom creates the world, the ephemeral Aitor embodies the primal force of air. Through him come the wind, breath and ether. With Chaka, he brings fertile soil, with Raden, he brings hurricanes, with Aitor, the rain.</p><p><strong>Tendri</strong>: Divine herald of Chaka, Tendri is tasked with rousing the trees, seaweed and other plant life that blanket the earth and seas. She performs her duties with swift joy.</p><p><strong>Ladri</strong>: Divine herald of Aitor, Ladri is tasked with rousing the birds and flying fish that dance in his skies. She performs her duties with dancing abandon.</p><p><strong>Rugri</strong>: Divine herald of Raden, Rugri is tasked with rousing the warm spark of life that permeates all living things. She performs her tasks with a fiery intensity.</p><p> </p><p><i>THE MERMAIDS is RATED ""T"" – TEEN – Appropriate for readers age 12 and older.

When she finally indulges her own passions, they nearly destroy her. While tutoring the childlike Princess Melina, Jhana falls hopelessly in love with the dark, visiting princess Edris. Their torrid affair ends with the announcement of a political engagement between Edris and Melina, leaving Jhana devastated and suicidal. Though planning to end her misery on their wedding day, a visit with her benefactor Vana opens her eyes to the devastation caused by Queen Leith. Rather than end her life, she devotes it to overthrowing the Queen and the house of her former lover.Kendan: One of Jhana’s pupils, Kendan is good-hearted merchild with an extreme lack of focus, often seemingly unaware of what’s right in front of her. Rather than pay attention in class, she is forever running off to watch the scintillating colors of the rainbow fish. Is she a hopeless dreamer, addicted to shiny surfaces, ADD or all three? In any case, she’s present enough to remind her teacher to bid farewell to a benefactor, shaking Jhana from her own malaise.Gidri: Divine herald of Kalise, Gidri is tasked with rousing the creatures of the sea. The sadness of knowing all living things must die keeps her from accomplishing her goal. Enraged, Kalise gives her gills and fins, and casts her from his presence. Though her task is finally completed, she remains removed from her divine source. To the mermaids, she is a goddess in her own right, and an example to live by. Through worship they honor her love and sacrifice.Melina: Naïve, childlike daughter of Queen Leith, ruler of Loria, Melina loves both Jhana and Edris with an open heart. Unaware of their affair, her engagement to Edris delights her. Unaware of politics, her kidnapping by the rebels only confuses her.Edris: Impulsive daughter of Sandra’s Queen Vanthi, blackfish of the family, Edris loves the tutor Jhana with a passion. At the same time, she’s tired of living in the long shadow cast by her more noble sister, Elexa. When her mother betroths her to the naïve young Melina for political reasons, she turns her back on Jhana and obeys, only to find herself in a battle for the realm, on the opposite side of her former.Vava: A kindly older mermaid who took Jhana in when her affair with Edris ended and she was forced to leave the palace. It’s only when the compassionate Vava and her family are forced to leave Loria that Jhana sees firsthand the cruelty of Leith’s armies.Leith the Shark Queen: Everyone has heard the rumor that Loria’s ambitious ruler Leith killed her own mother to speed her ascension to the throne. Far fewer know that Loria is also a changeling, able to transform a deadly killer. As new leader, the Shark Queen’s cruelty begat rebellion, her harsh military response has destroyed the realm’s resources and forced the starving to flee in droves. Marrying her daughter Melina to Edris of Palagia, ties her family to the ocean’s most powerful army, leaving the other realms wondering who she’ll seek to conquer next.Thessa: Queen of Rhanur, the compassionate Thessa risks attack when she opens her borders to Loria’s starving fugitives. If Queen Leith believes her in league with the rebels, Rhanur may be her next target. Though supporting the rebel cause, Thessa not only has a far weaker military, she and her wife Ydim have a child on the way.Ydim:  Wife of Thessa, Queen of Rhanur, Ydim is pregnant with their first child, who will be heir to the throne – if the realm survives. Though she loves and respects her queen, the more pragmatic Ydim fears her too-kind wife will bring the Shark-queen’s wrath down on their smaller realm when she opens their borders to Loria’s starving fugitives.Loria: The undersea realm of Loria is second only to Palagia in size and strength. Once the gem of the seas, the cruel reign of Leith, the Shark Queen led to rebellion. The harsh military response collapsed the civil order, devastated their resources and led to a massive exodus of starving refugees. Rather than help her people, Leith is more interested in joining her family to Palagia by marriage. When she succeeds, neutralizing her biggest threat, it seems only a matter of time before the army shifts from crushing rebels to conquering new territory.Pelagia: With the most powerful military under the waves, whither Pelagia turns, so goes the undersea world. Only Loria’s army, if it joined with just one other realm, might challenge her. Some believe Loria’s recent aggressions led Pelagia’s Queen to agree to joining the ruling families through the marriage of her daughter Edris to Loria’s Princess Melina.Gordova: Gordova, capital of Loria, holds the grand palace of the vicious Queen Leith, where she lives with her conniving concubine, the Lady Vita, and her naïve, child-like daughter Melina. Once-glorious, thanks to Leith’s harsh treatment of the rebels, the city is now by plagued by famine and a decaying social order. The citizens live in fear, the starving flee in droves.Rhanur: A vulnerable neighbor to the newly militant Loria, the peaceful Rhanur has opened its borders to the starving refugees. Its own resources strained, should it prove to harbor the rebels Loria wants to destroy, it may swiftly become Queen Leith’s next target. When princess Melina is kidnapped and Loria’s armies on the move, the time has come for Rhanur to act.Vanthi: Queen of Sandar, the most powerful undersea realm, Vanthi is also mother to Edris, the family’s impulsive blackfish, and the noble Elexa, hero to the people. When Elexa returns from a quest suffering a strange madness, a cloud hands over the realm.

When she returns from a dangerous quest suffering a strange madness, it makes the realm seem weaker. Family blackfish Edris becomes the only viable heir, and a pawn in a complex political game.Gimaine: Jester and gadfly to more than one queen, Gimaine’s brash, scathing tongue has nearly been cut out by irate royalty on many occasions.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>In 1967, Scott Anders rocketed into space on a secret, CIA-sponsored mission referred to as the Kayless Project... to investigate an astronomical anomaly known only in the darkest corridors of the U.S. Government. Three days later all communication ceased. The project, seen  as an embarrassing and costly failure, was erased from history and forgotten.</p>
<p>Until today, when Scott mysteriously plummets to earth and emerges, unscathed, and hellbent on one purpose… to return to the anomaly in space. Why does he want to go back? How did he gain his new invulnerability? And what is the mysterious organization that stands in his way, determined to protect the secret of Kayless at all costs?</p>

Beltox is The lead Scientist in DNA Modification, and an expert in dragonfly DNA. His collection of different species from different planets led people to nickname him The Curator. They reside on the planet Selusha, a murky,  red planet that looks like a hybrid of Earth and Mars.

Grove is an ancient sorcerer whose special vintages of wine, often contain aspects of potions. Some potions make the wine taste better, some make the wine ferment faster, some make the wine last longer but most importantly, some give special effects to the drinker of the wine. These are generally very expensive and reserved for the most elite of customers. But not all visitors to Ye Olde Wine Port have the best intentions...</p>
<p>“Greetings! Welcome to Ye Olde Wine Port! This is my humble establishment! Now, I must insist you ask your palette to name a taste you never even dreamed of before. Take your time and think of starflowers… or lavaginger… or even the spice rings of Saturn 11! Whatever your desire, it will be my absolute honor to quench it with a sampling from my vast and timeless collection of wines! Smile! You are my celebrated guests!

<h3><strong>THE TOMMY GUN DOLLS VOL. 2</strong></h3>
<p>Frankie, the grifter is back along with those bawdy burlesque girls--Poppy, Mai and Rose as they'll discover what friendship and trust really means to one another. The stakes get higher as they close in on finding Rouletta's murderer while in the midst of an all out turf war between the crime syndicates in San Francisco’s seedy underworld backstreets during the Prohibition Era.</p>
<p>Inspired by a true story of San Francisco’s dark underworld, a group of Prohibition Era burlesque dancers pursue their friend’s murder by posing as masked bandits and knocking over the Mob’s speakeasies. The Tommy Gun Dolls is a sordid tale told in the classic Noir tradition, with roots in San Francisco’s historic Nob Hill Mansions of society’s elite class down to the seedy gang-filled streets of Chinatown, through the Tenderloin and neighboring North Beach. </p>

<h3><strong>REPRESENTATION:</strong></h3>
<p>""Growing up, comic books meant the world to me! They were my passion and my escape but I never found myself in the pages. When I started sharing my favorite stories and superheroes with my daughters it really hit me, I didn't have a Puerto Rican superhero or even an authentic Puerto Rican story to share with them...so I decided to share mine. The Pagan is a story of a displaced Taino without a tribe. This is ONE Puerto Rican story..."" ~ David Pagan </p>

<h3><strong>LETTER FROM THE CREATOR:</strong></h3>
<p>    “From the bottom of my heart, thank you for sharing this with me. I’ve always loved comics as a kid so writing one has been a surreal experience. Still doesn’t feel real but it has been fun as F*_K. The writing process gave birth to an entire universe even we were surprised by so I hope you enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed writing this bad boy!”       ~David Pagan</p>

<h3><strong>COSTS and STRETCH GOALS:</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal is to cover the cost of creating the book, the cover, the variant cover, and printing all the rewards. We also plan to add some bonus materials to your rewards if we can get past a few of our goals. This includes the $5,000 mark, $10,000, and $15,000. We understand that the costs may seem high compared to buying in a store, but you are not just buying the book... you're helping us create it!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>SHIPPING:</strong></h3>
<p>We understand that when you pick a campaign to back you try to estimate every penny you spend. We are working with a TOP fulfillment printer to get you the BEST comics and merch. Shipping has increased over time and we have set out prices for shipping as low as we can without taking a loss or being unable to fulfill your order. These complications are also why we currently are not offering shipping to outside the United States. However, we have worked hard to make sure things are ready to ship as fast as possible. Once we receive funds we will begin shipping!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges:</strong></h3>
<p>This book has had many challenges, including COVID19. But we have worked nonstop to try and bring this to you as soon as possible! It is David Pagan's first book and he intends a total of twelve. So one of our main challenges was making sure this first book was not only going to deliver the information you need for the following books, but that it would be a great story all by itself! We want readers to be able to read one issue and feel like they went for a ride!</p>

<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></h3>
<p>Please share this campaign with your social media, fiends, and family! There are not enough Puerto Rican characters in today's world! WTF Comics has many other projects and we take each one very seriously! Help this project be a success so we can continue to bring you all new characters, stories and creators!

   The premiere, 28 page issue, of  THE PAGAN! This is issue dives into the paranoid world of Manuel “Manny” Pagan, THE DAMNED SHAMAN. To most the world around him, Manny, is a generally good guy. By day he works and lives above an orphanage. By night he parties like he might die tomorrow. Is he just paranoid or is someone truly after him? More importantly what is the ""fix"" he seems so desperate to obtain?
   A man framed for his daughter’s murder and estranged from everything he’s ever known. He must learn how to control his emotions... so he can BLLLLLAAAAST his enemies to shreds with them! 
 
THE STORY: (Some Spoilers)
   Trained by a secret society to use his powers of persuasion to control the masses and then exiled for refusal, Manny hunts for meaning and some semblance of peace and normality. Brokenhearted, soul tainted and framed for his daughter’s murder he finds safety living above an orphanage in a small community when his true powers emerge. Visions of his daughter haunt Manny while he hides from both public and secret societies. It is in this hidden hell, The Pagan is born...

REPRESENTATION:
""Growing up, comic books meant the world to me! They were my passion and my escape but I never found myself in the pages. When I started sharing my favorite stories and superheroes with my daughters it really hit me, I didn't have a Puerto Rican superhero or even an authentic Puerto Rican story to share with them...so I decided to share mine. The Pagan is a story of a displaced Taino without a tribe. This is ONE Puerto Rican story..."" ~ David Pagan 

 

VARIANT COVER:
    We have a special variant cover from DC artist Yanick Paquette! We will reveal this cover very soon! Reserve you copy ASAP!


THE ART:
   Below are a few samples of the art work, we will be releasing the A Cover very soon, and the Variant Cover by Yanick Paquette! You may notice there is very little showing the ""beast"" seen in some of the art above... that is because there is a major plot point we are avoiding... we will add some other action scenes as we receive more artwork from GS20 Studio our production partner. 





 
LETTER FROM THE CREATOR:
    “From the bottom of my heart, thank you for sharing this with me. I’ve always loved comics as a kid so writing one has been a surreal experience. Still doesn’t feel real but it has been fun as F*_K. The writing process gave birth to an entire universe even we were surprised by so I hope you enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed writing this bad boy!”       ~David Pagan

 
LOCATION:
This book is set in Orlando, Florida! Real people and real locations are used as inspiration for the artwork you see. Even the music used in our video is provided by Metane Phillips (AKA- METANE)! 


 
COSTS and STRETCH GOALS:
Our goal is to cover the cost of creating the book, the cover, the variant cover, and printing all the rewards. We also plan to add some bonus materials to your rewards if we can get past a few of our goals. This includes the $5,000 mark, $10,000, and $15,000. We understand that the costs may seem high compared to buying in a store, but you are not just buying the book... you're helping us create it!
 
SHIPPING:
We understand that when you pick a campaign to back you try to estimate every penny you spend. We are working with a TOP fulfillment printer to get you the BEST comics and merch. Shipping has increased over time and we have set out prices for shipping as low as we can without taking a loss or being unable to fulfill your order. These complications are also why we currently are not offering shipping to outside the United States. However, we have worked hard to make sure things are ready to ship as fast as possible. Once we receive funds we will begin shipping!
 
Risks & Challenges:
This book has had many challenges, including COVID19. But we have worked nonstop to try and bring this to you as soon as possible! It is David Pagan's first book and he intends a total of twelve. So one of our main challenges was making sure this first book was not only going to deliver the information you need for the following books, but that it would be a great story all by itself! We want readers to be able to read one issue and feel like they went for a ride!

 
Other Ways You Can Help:
Please share this campaign with your social media, fiends, and family! There are not enough Puerto Rican characters in today's world! WTF Comics has many other projects and we take each one very seriously! Help this project be a success so we can continue to bring you all new characters, stories and creators! At WTF Comics one of our top priorities is to elevate talented creators that have never gotten the attention they deserve!

Eine Science Fiction Story über drei Söldner, die widerwillig für einen korrupten Politiker arbeiten. Mit eurer Hilfe möchte ich diesen Comic im typischen US-Heftformat in Deutschland herausbringen.Die Entwicklung der Alcubierre'schen Warp-Technologie hat alles verändert. Sie versetzt uns in fremde Galaxien und erlaubt uns die Eroberung der Sterne. Zwar trafen wir im ganzen Universum auf intelligentes Leben, doch die Mächtigen sind noch immer mächtig, die Reichen noch immer reich und nun richtet sich die Gier der Mega-Corporations, einst auf eine im All treibende Felskugel beschränkt, auf Gefilde jenseits der Sterne.Wir haben neue Bündnisse geschmiedet, aber das ein oder andere Mal haben wir auch furchtbar versagt. Statt unseren heimischen Boden unter uns aufzuteilen, tun wir dies nun mit den Weiten des Universums und alles nur für das liebe Geld. Allein die Sinnlosigkeit des Kapitalismus ist nicht das einzige Thema auf der Tagesordnung. Weitere Probleme tauchten am Horizont auf, als Terra von den Wogen der Konflikte zwischen den Alien-Völkern erfasst wurde. Streitigkeiten um Lebensraum, um knappe Ressourcen, religiös motivierter Völkermord und zu allem Überfluss noch die nicht enden wollende Völkerwanderung der T’Sorianer tragen das Ihre zu der besorgniserregenden Überbevölkerung auf Terra bei.Vor diesem Hintergrund erzählt DERELICTS die actiongeladene Geschichte einer zerrütteten Truppe von Sternen-Söldnern, die an Bord ihres alten Raumers versuchen, über die Runden zu kommen. Dabei stellen sie sich lebensbedrohlichen Missionen, manövrieren durch ein ebenso tödliches Netz aus Intrigen, um am Ende einen Platz für sich im Universum zu finden. Dies ist die Geschichte hinter der Comic-Reihe DERELICTS, in deren Genuss nun auch die deutschen Fans kommen sollen. Und dazu brauche ich eure Hilfe. DERELICTS ist als 3-teilige Heftserie im US-Format 168 x 260 mm geplant. Das erste Heft enthält 24 Seiten. Während das Lineart für alle 24 Seiten bereits vollständig vorliegt, werden die Seiten derzeit koloriert und gelettert. Das offizielle Print zu DERELICTS von Ralf Singh und Nic Chapuis. Gedruckt wird es auf hochwertigem Papier im A4 Format.FRANK MELIÉREEin terranischer Veteran, Kommandant der Mansonia und Anführer des Söldnertrupps, um den es in DERELICTS geht. Frank hat anhaltend damit zu kämpfen, dass für ihn als Cyborg die Grenzen zwischen Mensch und Maschine verschwimmen. So sind große Teile seiner Vergangenheit in Finsternis gehüllt, doch er ist bestrebt Licht ins Dunkel zu bringen. Seine Implantate erlauben es ihm unter anderem, sich mit Maschinen zu verbinden, insbesondere mit Onodata, der für ihn wie ein Exokortex, eine externe Erweiterung seines Gehirns, fungieren kann.ILKEE KR`TOV / CRICKETDie T'Sorianerin ist Angehörige eines außerirdischen Volkes, das humanoiden Grashüpfern ähnelt. Ihre Heimatwelt T'Sor wird immer wieder von dem Volk der Tuatara angegriffen, was die beiden Spezies immer wieder aneinander geraten lässt. Ilkee ist erst seit Kurzem bei dem Söldnertrupp. Ihr Talent und ihre Aufgabe ist es, sich unbemerkt einzuschleichen. Sie ist süchtig nach Grünem Tee und jahrhunderte alten Telenovelas.HUN’MAKEiner der wenigen Tuatara-Überläufer, ist er ein starker aber in sich gekehrter Kraftprotz, was ungewöhnlich für ein Volk ist, dessen einziger Antrieb Zerstörungswut zu sein scheint. Tuatara sind gnadenlose Reptiloide, die schon rein auf neurologischer Ebene unfähig sind, Mitgefühl zu empfinden. Sie versklaven, erobern und nehmen sich was sie wollen mit Gewalt. Hun'Mak dagegen scheint sich nach anderen Dingen zu sehnen. Obwohl die Tuatara zu den intelligenten Alien-Völkern zählen, gehören sie nicht dem CSS, dem Zusammenschluss von Systemen intelligenter Völker an und sind diesem daher bei der Expansion in den Lyra-Sektor im Weg. ZINNOBERDrachen haben die Erde erobert. Die letzten Überlebenden der Menschheit kämpfen um das blanke Überleben. Doch eines Tages bekommt die Waise Claire die Chance, das Blatt zu wenden und den Drachen einen schweren Schlag zu versetzen. Ihr Motiv ist Rache, denn die neuen Beherrscher der Erde haben vor zwanzig Jahren alles zu Asche verbrannt, was sie je geliebt hat.  Der erste Band von Zinnober mit 100 Seiten.

Overview
Octopus Cowboy Book 1 is the first installment in an ongoing series, a 100+ page, full color, perfect bound graphic novel written and illustrated by Jason Orfalas. The purpose of this crowdfunding campaign is to get this book out there directly to be enjoyed by readers. Your contribution would help pay for printing and fulfilment.

 
 
 
Story
Slade is a highly evolved pacific octopus endowed with an intelligent spirit. Captured by humans and taken miles away from the ocean...

 
...he is forced to fight in a vicious bloodsport where animals are pitted against each other for entertainment.
 

 
His captor and caretaker is ex-fighter Charlie Knox, a heavy-handed broken man and killer, exploiting animals to make a living.
 

 
After what should've been a highly profitable match, Charlie is cheated out of his payment.
Now he has no choice but to return to the town where he fell from grace and risk it all in a high-stakes bout that Slade can't possibly win.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The story exists in a fantasy world pushed past the medieval era, where gunpowder has shaken the very foundations of society – much in the way it did our own world. Gunpowder has democratized power by diminishing the role of knights and mages. The story follows a young wannabe knight – a member of a noble house of former knights and dragon hunters. Favian (aka The Flintlock Knight) struggles to find his place in a world that has moved on from the antiquated idea of knights.<br/>Before the events of the story, The Flintlock Knight spent his days roaming the countryside, trying to recapture the honor and glory of the past by completing petty tasks and helping people in need. But when an ancient evil is re-awoken, he is thrust into an epic world of sorcery, intrigue, and adventure.</p>
<p>Created and written by David W., pencils and inks by Marcelo Oliveira Costa, and letters by Jahch.</p>
<p>This campaign is for Issue #1, consisting of 22 pages of story. The issue is now completed and is at the printer!</p>
<p>The comic will be in full greyscale.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why was this created? </strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> I’ve always enjoyed storytelling and manga since I was a very young child. This is why I chose the manga style.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622776088/w2piqn3wtvvacjn1ct2f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>What made me want to create this story was, for two main reasons. The first and foremost reason is to make an entertaining, positive story for the world. Something to honor all of the dear friends and family that I have lost over my lifetime. Every character has pieces of people that were dear to my heart. This is a project that has become my entire reason to keep pushing forward.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622776217/thuit8gadmiu1n6dvsmi.png"" src=""""/><br/> Secondly, as an LGBT+ creator with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, I want to show that disabled people want and like the same things as other people. The story purposely doesn't ignore or focus on this and focuses more on fun characters, some just happen to have a disability.

</div></div>","Second Chance Campaign for people that missed the original Kickstarter!
Book now 400 pages of story and art!
[PG and PG-13 on rare occasions]
Foxy and Wolfy volume 1 is the first of 7 planned books for the series. Each book will be 160-240 pages, except the first one at 400 pages. This project is my heart and soul and I want to share this awesome adventure with everyone! We have updated scenes, redone dialogue and colored 100%

Foxy and Wolfy is about the adventures of two spirit guardians. A Foxy young spirit guardian with muscular dystrophy named Misaki Kimura and her Wolfy partner, Amaya Bellerose.

Known as mahou shoujo (""magical girl"") or just majokko (""witch-girl"") in Japanese, Magical Girls are empowered by various means with fantastic powers that both assist and complicate their lives, but manage to persevere despite this.

In the world of Foxy and Wolfy Chaos, spirit guardians are humans who fight genocidal demons and purify souls consumed by hatred. Through the use of spirit keys, the main characters Misaki and Amaya (along with their friends) travel between the human and demon worlds to defend all they hold precious against nefarious demons seeking chaos.

Volume 1 follows their initial origins at Foxshuffle academy as new kid mages, and their first official mission as adults! Expect magical combat, silly shenanigans and deadly fanatical demon attacks! You will see them when they are kids first and later as adults going after their first target.  Come join the fun!

Why was this created? 
 I’ve always enjoyed storytelling and manga since I was a very young child. This is why I chose the manga style.

What made me want to create this story was, for two main reasons. The first and foremost reason is to make an entertaining, positive story for the world. Something to honor all of the dear friends and family that I have lost over my lifetime. Every character has pieces of people that were dear to my heart. This is a project that has become my entire reason to keep pushing forward.
 Secondly, as an LGBT+ creator with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, I want to show that disabled people want and like the same things as other people. The story purposely doesn't ignore or focus on this and focuses more on fun characters, some just happen to have a disability. One of my goals is to positively portray a disabled LGBT+ character without making it the only layer to them.  The first priority is fun for all! Comics bring EVERYONE joy and should be enjoyed by all.


 Who will love Foxy and Wolfy? 
 Fans of Sailor Moon, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Cardcaptor Sakura and other fun magical girl series. 
People who like My Hero Academia, Fairy Tail, Inuyasha and other fantasy tales with a large, fun cast of characters. 
Collectors of independent comic books and manga! 
If you like your comics with shonen style fighting, fun shenanigans, and wholesome yuri, THIS IS YOUR BOOK!

<h3><i>Short Summary</i></h3>
<p>I am a child of the 80’s. I grew up with some amazing TV and film, especially in the sci-fi and action genre. Movies like Total Recall, Blade Runner, Alien, Aliens and Terminator were on the top of my list. On the TV side, we had A-Team, Battlestar Galactica, and of course Miami Vice. Not to mention, some really great cartoons. Mars City Vice is inspired by a lot of great 80’s film and TV! <strong> You will receive a digital version when you back a printed copy.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613841279/iun1xvetpvnuonvo1z0m.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<h3><i>What's the Story of the Comic? </i></h3>
<p>Mars circa 2089, humans live and play alongside various extraterrestrial races. Several planets in our solar system have been colonized for many years. The Moon has sprawling slums, while Mars has become a popular and exclusive theme park based on a super stylized version of 80's Miami - a synthetic world of cloned flamingos, neon and fast cars. Two unlikely police detectives, a human Maxwell 'Moony' Boone and his new alien partner Tykar 'Ty' Baths try and overcome their differences, as they work undercover in this fake 1980's Miami investigating a mysterious kingpin, who is threatening to corrupt the solar system with a new drug made from a rare alien blood</p>

<h3>Recap of Issue #1 &amp; #2</h3>
<p><strong>Issue #1: 'Wipe off that Grin'</strong></p>
<p>Our story starts in the crime infested slums of Moon York, Moon York. We open on the alien detective Tykar 'Ty' Baths. He is working deep undercover on his own trying to find his missing sister Carena. She is being held against her will by the arch criminal Hadrian, who is making a drug created using the blood of Bath's and Carena's people (Maldakiens). Boone also starts out in Moon York as an undercover detective on the trail of Hadrian, but finds himself the target of his own fellow policeman.</p>
<p><strong>Issue #2: 'I've Seen Your Face Before'</strong></p>
<p>Boone is transferred to Mars City, currently themed like Miami in the 80's. He is prepped about all things 1980's and inserted into the amusement park city to be more actor than cop, which he hates. He soon learns that nothing is as it seems, and there is real crime in the fake city. He is partnered up with the stoic Baths by their hard-boiled Lt Vedanko and the two 80's obsessed alien twins. Baths and Boone butt heads at first, but come to realize they are both after the same arch criminal. Hadrian sends a hit squad led by an unstoppable killer, and there is of course - a big explosion. Does someone die?</p>

<h2>THE SETTING</h2>
<p>Apollo Beach is a popular resort town in the summer. There was a time that the small town even claimed it's own super hero, The Valkyrie! The Valkyrie once defended Apollo Beach against strange giant monsters. In winter now the tourists are all gone and they aren't all that is missing. Both The Valkyrie and the monsters she once battled have all disappeared.</p>
<p>Tim Boring is one of a handful of people who knows what happened to her. The Valkyrie's real name is Sofie Iceni and she was the love of his life. Sofie left Tim upon learning that it was The Valkyrie's powers themselves that had summoned the monsters she fought.</p>
<h2>THE CONFLICT</h2>
<p>At a drunken party Tim meets Journeigh Weathers. Journeigh is a free spirited and somewhat selfish young woman who gladly takes on the mantle of The Valkyrie. Journeigh thinks fighting giant monsters would be fun and isn't concerned with the safety of those around her. Now he's stuck with a crazy woman who is willing to put all of Apollo Beach in danger for her own entertainment!</p>

What is Island 19 A Tale of the Bermuda Triangle?
The story (90-100 pages), is based on the true events surrounding the 1945 disappearance of NAS Flight 19 over the Bermuda Triangle.
You'll follow the exploits of the mission commander of Flight 19, Captain Pete ""Crash"" Keddel as he may or may not become the inspiration for the classic fictional forever kid-- Peter Pan!
Never-Land was never like this! Nazis, Pirates, Native Tribes and an ancient battle between good and evil set the scene for Captain Keddel and his new friends as they look to uncover the mysteries of Island 19.  Please check out the preview below:

<h3>A Tale Spanning the First Ages of Time and Space   </h3>
<p>At the beginning of the universe, a world forms at its centre and life springs forth upon it. The world becomes known as Ines. The divine Dragi are the first advanced race to appear and in their divinity create two races, each containing different parts of themselves. The Homin and Orested. An age of peace ensues.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559004312/zoljgrmpiqvnmrfnxsj4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Not all is right in this world, however At its centre lies a dark heart. A creature of unimaginable terror emerges from this dark heart and bursts forth upon the surface. It brings forth a plague that mutates the bodies of the dead and creates monsters which spread out with one mission: KILL ALL LIFE. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559004421/u0rorpbjnlb5ciucp7qh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The peoples of the world, the Homin and Orested, band together with their creators, the Dragi, to fight back the monsters and defeat the terror. Ultimately the Dragi devise a way to defeat the evil creature at the cost of their lives. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559004733/r0eabugh4qfxoakucqap.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Peace returns to the world and time winds forward through history until the Age of the Angelous, the new ruling race of the planet. A hybrid of the Homin and Orested, they inherit the power the Dragi once processed. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559005586/lgayn75royxijvhwtaxv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>They raise an island nation into the skies as a testament to their power. From this land, rule over the remaining Homin and Orested just as their Dragi creators once did. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559006102/h8dnps9g2gz8bovvkfrh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The evil was not fully defeated and it now returns in a diminished, but no less dangerous form. After several lost battles against this new foe, the Angelous retreat to their flying cities and abandon the surface dwellers, betraying their role as protector in the most heinous of ways.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559006364/feboysqzlzzy3d6metfm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> A secret group forms within the Angelous military bent on helping the surface and ridding the world of this ancient evil. This elite group of deeply spiritual and moral warriors is lead by the great High Judicar Phasenion. His young, head strong,  but loyal student Onixia is tasked with the burden of finding the one thing that can save the world after a terrible tragedy.  As the events unfold, Onixia must complete this task or all life in the world shall perish.</p>
<p>“Of Time and Space” is a callback to the sci-fi and fantasy tales I was influenced by as a child, with some inspiration from religion and myths.</p>
<p>The Lunar Rise is the first Chapter of the 5 chapter spanning saga that is Of Time and Space. There are 5 Chapters mapped out for the whole story that follow a linear progression over thousands of years on the planet Ines.</p>
<p>By helping to fund this you are helping to fund many more stories to come in this saga. </p>

</div></div>","A Tale Spanning the First Ages of Time and Space   
At the beginning of the universe, a world forms at its centre and life springs forth upon it. The world becomes known as Ines. The divine Dragi are the first advanced race to appear and in their divinity create two races, each containing different parts of themselves. The Homin and Orested. An age of peace ensues.


Not all is right in this world, however At its centre lies a dark heart. A creature of unimaginable terror emerges from this dark heart and bursts forth upon the surface. It brings forth a plague that mutates the bodies of the dead and creates monsters which spread out with one mission: KILL ALL LIFE. 


The peoples of the world, the Homin and Orested, band together with their creators, the Dragi, to fight back the monsters and defeat the terror. Ultimately the Dragi devise a way to defeat the evil creature at the cost of their lives. 


Peace returns to the world and time winds forward through history until the Age of the Angelous, the new ruling race of the planet. A hybrid of the Homin and Orested, they inherit the power the Dragi once processed. 

They raise an island nation into the skies as a testament to their power. From this land, rule over the remaining Homin and Orested just as their Dragi creators once did. 

The evil was not fully defeated and it now returns in a diminished, but no less dangerous form. After several lost battles against this new foe, the Angelous retreat to their flying cities and abandon the surface dwellers, betraying their role as protector in the most heinous of ways.


 A secret group forms within the Angelous military bent on helping the surface and ridding the world of this ancient evil. This elite group of deeply spiritual and moral warriors is lead by the great High Judicar Phasenion. His young, head strong,  but loyal student Onixia is tasked with the burden of finding the one thing that can save the world after a terrible tragedy.  As the events unfold, Onixia must complete this task or all life in the world shall perish.
“Of Time and Space” is a callback to the sci-fi and fantasy tales I was influenced by as a child, with some inspiration from religion and myths.
The Lunar Rise is the first Chapter of the 5 chapter spanning saga that is Of Time and Space. There are 5 Chapters mapped out for the whole story that follow a linear progression over thousands of years on the planet Ines.
By helping to fund this you are helping to fund many more stories to come in this saga. 

 
What You Are Funding and What You Get
Your funding is very important to the completion of this book in a timely manner. The script, design and basic layout are all complete. The funding will cover the remaining sequential art for the book, 14 of the 48 pages are complete at this time. With your support, I can order the rest of the pages from Rob Cannon all at once. Once funded, we plan to ship in December of 2019. 
There are great perks available, besides the book itself, every copy will be signed by me, Larry Holder, on the inside cover.

 

 
Besides the regular full wrap cover there will also a second full wrap variant available, in limited quantity,  featuring the two concept posters by Andre Boulard and Daswhox. These copies also come signed of course.

 
I also have a set of metal prints available featuring both the cover art and a selected image from Page 21 of the book. These are actually images transferred directly onto a sheet of aluminum. These will be available in super limited quantity due to high production cost.

With art complete and colours and letters budgeted for already, there should be a quick turn around time on this title! No year-long waits from BLACKPRYOR PRESS! In fact, while the Issue #1 campaign is live and funding, Brazillian Superstar artist Celso Mazine will already be hard at work on THE COMPANY MEN: DEAD, WHITE AND BLUE Issue #2! Again, this work is budgeted for separate to the outcome of this campaign!

Supernatural energies and monstrosities pour into the frontier, transforming a large part of America in a lethal no-man’s land. For the settlers the winning of the West, near to its end, has to restart from scratch.

<h3>A little history and a glimpse into the future</h3>
<p>I have fulfilled more than a dozen crowdfunding campaigns on another platform.  I have a lot of experience in campaign fulfillment.  These issues are printed and in hand so perks for this campaign will begin shipping once campaign funds are received from Indiegogo.  </p>
<p><strong><i>Issue one's first press run sold out in its entirety</i></strong> so I commissioned a second cover from Alexia Veldhuisen and had a larger press run printed.  Print copies of issue one shipped through this campaign are from that second press run.  Issue two's successful crowdfunding campaign paid for the issue's art, variant covers and lettering, giving us three gorgeous covers for our second issue.  </p>
<p><strong>Yes, this means that perks are shipping.</strong></p>
<p>Take a look at my crowdfunding history both through my <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/sinopapublishing/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">personal profile</a> and through the <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sinopapublishingllc/sinopa-omnibus-volume-one-5e-npcs-stories-and-more?ref=discovery&amp;term=sinopa%20publishing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sinopa Publishing profile</a> to see my track record of successfully funded and fulfilled campaigns.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>These issues are on hand and waiting to ship.  The only real risks are in shipping.  To help mitigate shipping risks we ship all comics bagged and boarded and packed in Gemini Mailers.  Large (11 by 17 inch) art prints shipped sleeved in UltraPro top loaders and are packed in USPS board game boxes (along with any other accompanying perks).   </p>
<p>There are a few things you can do to help make certain shipping risk is minimized:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide your full and correctly spelled mailing / shipping address.</li>
<li>If your address changes before fulfillment has begun, please notify me immediately so I can update the information before books are shipping out the door.</li>
<li>Provide a good email address so that my mailing software/service can send your tracking information to you.</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","The story of the 47 Ronin!
47 Furious Tails is the story of the Ako Incident, the tale of the 47 Samurai who avenged the death of their lord and became legendary ronin.  This series tells this timeless classic from the pages of Japan's history through the use of anthropomorphic animal characters, in an art style that harkens back to the wood block prints of the Edo period and utilizes traditional ink brush techniques as well.   

Issues one and two of this twelve issue limited series are now printed and ready to ship.  
If you're looking for an exciting new title, enjoy furious samurai action, and support the indie comic renaissance, then this is the title for you! 

Featuring art by Kubert school alum Alexia Veldhuisen (Cover and all interiors)
Written by W.S. ""Sam"" Quinton (Sinopa Publishing).
Each tier ships print copy of issue 1 plus one (or more) of the available covers for issue 2.
Variant covers available for issue two by Kubert School instructor Fernando Ruiz and by Kubert school alum Paul Walcott.
Printed in 6 by 9 inch digest size, on 80lb paper with an exquisite 130lb satin soft touch finished cover.  Premium papers used for quality and durability. 



What We Need & What You Get
We know that a lot of Indie comic fans prefer the Indiegogo platform so we're bringing 47 Furious Tails here so you too can enjoy this new series. 
What do we get out of this?  We get to expand our readership, introduce people to our work, and generate more revenue to fund future issues.  Net proceeds from this campaign will be used to help fund future issues.  
What we are offering:

Our tiers ship print copies of 47 Furious Tails, Issue One (28 full color pages) and Issue Two (20 full color pages) straight to you.  
You can add on additional copies as you like.
All contributing artists have already been paid for their work at fair market rates and under written contracts. Proceeds from this campaign will fund shipping of backer rewards with remaining funds to be used for creating future issues.  
Shipping perks whether we reach goal or not (flexible funding). 



A little history and a glimpse into the future
I have fulfilled more than a dozen crowdfunding campaigns on another platform.  I have a lot of experience in campaign fulfillment.  These issues are printed and in hand so perks for this campaign will begin shipping once campaign funds are received from Indiegogo.  
Issue one's first press run sold out in its entirety so I commissioned a second cover from Alexia Veldhuisen and had a larger press run printed.  Print copies of issue one shipped through this campaign are from that second press run.  Issue two's successful crowdfunding campaign paid for the issue's art, variant covers and lettering, giving us three gorgeous covers for our second issue.  
Yes, this means that perks are shipping.
Take a look at my crowdfunding history both through my personal profile and through the Sinopa Publishing profile to see my track record of successfully funded and fulfilled campaigns.
 

Risks & Challenges
These issues are on hand and waiting to ship.  The only real risks are in shipping.  To help mitigate shipping risks we ship all comics bagged and boarded and packed in Gemini Mailers.  Large (11 by 17 inch) art prints shipped sleeved in UltraPro top loaders and are packed in USPS board game boxes (along with any other accompanying perks).   
There are a few things you can do to help make certain shipping risk is minimized:

Provide your full and correctly spelled mailing / shipping address.
If your address changes before fulfillment has begun, please notify me immediately so I can update the information before books are shipping out the door.
Provide a good email address so that my mailing software/service can send your tracking information to you.

County, from South Central to Palmdale and from Venice to East L.A.in order to incorporate the many cultures of Los Angeles into the posters themselves. </p><p>Back in 2010, I realized that I possessed a true form of Folk Art -- hand-drawn, hand-painted posters made by ordinary people. They were meditations on the mundane.  At this time I foresaw the rise of these posters becoming fully digitized templates and felt that the form of Folk Art displayed in these posters had every right to be preserved and viewed for years to come. </p><p>If every piece of art has a story, some pieces of art have deeper and more meaningful stories than others. These posters tell the story about the times and places in which we are living. The posters use the combined artistic mediums of graphic and visual arts, illustration, and photography in a poetic and cohesive collage of raw emotion to tell their tale. </p><p>I went on to find posters of dogs, cats, dragons, unicorns, clip-art bunnies, toucans, and many more. In total, I collected over 2,000 posters amassing the world’s largest collection of this form of Folk Art.</p><p>After my collection for this book came to a close. I started an Instagram account which is now getting submissions from around the world. Posters from such places as: Argentina, Chile, Japan, China, Russia, Mexico, Canada, all of the United States, and Europe.</p><p>The Instagram has even helped reconnect people with their lost and found animals.  </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582151291/u4se12jizi2du5wwn4fw.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582151334/oqhjvryv0n2drhwig7xr.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582151373/eoxbaoekgumobzdzcsue.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582151399/cjuhkbpcys8gw6fmjow1.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582154296/smlnqpam8mkhgrsllfr5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582151875/h9gny7sgebkogmwmegdh.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><i><strong>$ANY AMOUNT: THE LOVEBIRD</strong></i></p><ul><li>You love the project and would like to make a pledge without any reward.</li></ul><p style=""text-align: center;"">(it's the pink button at the top right of this page that says ""<u>BACK IT</u>"")</p><p> </p><p><i><strong>$30: THE FLAMINGO (SUPER EARLY BIRD)</strong></i></p><ul><li>(1) Still Missing Book (limited pre-order edition/not signed)</li></ul><p> </p><p><i><strong>$45: THE TOUCAN (SIGNED EARLY BIRD BOOK)</strong></i></p><ul><li>(1) Still Missing Book (limited pre-order edition/hand-numbered/ signed by author)</li></ul><p> </p><p><i><strong>$50: 2 FLAMINGOS (SUPER EARLY BIRD)</strong></i></p><ul><li>(2) Still Missing Books (limited pre-order edition/not signed)</li></ul><p> </p><p><i><strong>$70: 2 TOUCANS (SIGNED EARLY BIRD BOOK)</strong></i></p><ul><li>(2) Still Missing Books (limited pre-order edition/hand-numbered/ signed by author)</li></ul><p> </p><p><strong><i>$75: THE HAMSTER (YOUR PET’S NAME IN THE BOOK)</i></strong></p><ul>

POSTER ADVENTURE with AUTHOR ($300) TOUR OF STARBURNS STUDIOS and ASSOCIATE PUBLISHER CREDIT on FRONT PAGE of the BOOK ($600)  From 2010 to 2013, I drove around Los Angeles County collecting lost and found animal posters. Being a huge animal lover myself, I set a rule for my project… I had to see at least three identical posters in a one-block area in order to take one (to not defeat the owners quest of finding their animal). For three years, I drove tirelessly all over L.A. County, from South Central to Palmdale and from Venice to East L.A.in order to incorporate the many cultures of Los Angeles into the posters themselves. Back in 2010, I realized that I possessed a true form of Folk Art -- hand-drawn, hand-painted posters made by ordinary people. They were meditations on the mundane.  At this time I foresaw the rise of these posters becoming fully digitized templates and felt that the form of Folk Art displayed in these posters had every right to be preserved and viewed for years to come. If every piece of art has a story, some pieces of art have deeper and more meaningful stories than others. These posters tell the story about the times and places in which we are living. The posters use the combined artistic mediums of graphic and visual arts, illustration, and photography in a poetic and cohesive collage of raw emotion to tell their tale. I went on to find posters of dogs, cats, dragons, unicorns, clip-art bunnies, toucans, and many more. In total, I collected over 2,000 posters amassing the world’s largest collection of this form of Folk Art.After my collection for this book came to a close. I started an Instagram account which is now getting submissions from around the world. Posters from such places as: Argentina, Chile, Japan, China, Russia, Mexico, Canada, all of the United States, and Europe.The Instagram has even helped reconnect people with their lost and found animals.        $ANY AMOUNT: THE LOVEBIRDYou love the project and would like to make a pledge without any reward.(it's the pink button at the top right of this page that says ""BACK IT"") $30: THE FLAMINGO (SUPER EARLY BIRD)(1) Still Missing Book (limited pre-order edition/not signed) $45: THE TOUCAN (SIGNED EARLY BIRD BOOK)(1) Still Missing Book (limited pre-order edition/hand-numbered/ signed by author) $50: 2 FLAMINGOS (SUPER EARLY BIRD)(2) Still Missing Books (limited pre-order edition/not signed) $70: 2 TOUCANS (SIGNED EARLY BIRD BOOK)(2) Still Missing Books (limited pre-order edition/hand-numbered/ signed by author) $75: THE HAMSTER (YOUR PET’S NAME IN THE BOOK)

<p>My name is Chris Morris and to me, ""Bwahahaha"" used to be, as Billy Idol would say, a ""Rebel Yell"", to a generation of comic book fans.  ""Bwahahaha"" meant you had a comic book in your hands that included action, superheroics, drama, great characters, but most importantly, HUMOUR!  AND FUN TOO!  Is this even TRUE?  Am I misquoting Billy Idol?  Am I OVERSTATING things to create CONTROVERSY and GET ATTENTION?  Am I using NOSTALGIA to get YOUR attention?  Am I simply abusing the CAPS LOCK button?<br/></p>

My name is Chris Morris and to me, ""Bwahahaha"" used to be, as Billy Idol would say, a ""Rebel Yell"", to a generation of comic book fans.  ""Bwahahaha"" meant you had a comic book in your hands that included action, superheroics, drama, great characters, but most importantly, HUMOUR!  AND FUN TOO!  Is this even TRUE?  Am I misquoting Billy Idol?  Am I OVERSTATING things to create CONTROVERSY and GET ATTENTION?  Am I using NOSTALGIA to get YOUR attention?  Am I simply abusing the CAPS LOCK button?

This quickly results in mayhem in the streets.Making matters worse is the discovery that the last stage of the disease is irreversible genetic damage.  Victims of the disease slowly descend into complete madness and in the final stages lose their very humanity becoming the stuff of nightmares.
In this darkest hour one military leader manages to hold parts of Moscow with his troops restoring some stability. 
As the deadly disease spreads throughout the world, the city under his control becomes a rallying point for the remaining resistance. The Commander is beautifully illustrated comic book project produced by the hard-working, talented people working for Red King Press, an up and coming Indy comic book company which prides itself on being innovative and as resourceful as they can possibly be with the tools at their disposal.  They truly believe the Commander # 1 is a project for which print copies should be made readily available and to do that they are asking for your support.What we need & what you getWe are wanting to have printed physical copies of the Commander # 1 made available.

<p><i>(Cover page)</i></p>
<h2>Zombiraq: War of the Undead</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Some of the oldest accounts of the dead raising from their graves to feast on human flesh can be traced back to the Middle East. During the Golden Age of Islam, a collection of tales called </span><i style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">One Thousand and One Nights </i><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">(sometimes known as </span><i style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Arabian Nights</i><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">) was compiled. In the early 1700's, those stories were translated and captivated English-speaking audiences for the first time. </span><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p>Centuries later, <i>Zombiraq </i>(Pronounced ""Zomb-ee-rok"")<i> </i>tells the story of a specialized Air Force detachment sent to Northern Iraq as reinforcements for a strained infantry company to combat a rising insurgency. When they arrive, they discover the ruthless militant group that they came to eradicate may be the least of their worries. </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Behind the Comic Book</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;"">In 2007, Dylan Park spent a life-changing year in Iraq. It was there that he witnessed both the beauty of the human spirit and the horrors of war. The time spent overseas, in some of the most deplorable conditions imaginable, would be the catalyst for his budding writing career. </span></p>
<p>One night during a patrol, while seeking shelter within the walls of an ancient cemetery, he pondered to himself how a graveyard could feel like the safest place in that country. It was an eye-opening epiphany that highlighted how atrocious one's circumstances really could be--admittedly, conditions that were previously foreign to Dylan. With the right combination of imagination, fatigue, and fear, it was there, in that graveyard, where the idea for <i>Zombiraq</i> was dreamt up.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p>After completing his 6-year stint in the military,<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> graduating from film school, </span>and gaining real world experience in Los Angeles, Dylan decided he wanted to put his story on paper.  He developed a colorful universe, wrote the manuscript, and sought to find the right artist for the job. Following countless hours of research, he finally found an illustrator who fit perfectly with the project--Daniel Reneau. Not only is Dan a phenomenal artist, he shared an excitement for the project that was integral.  </p>
<p>The two exchanged hundreds of emails--story ideas, concept art, everything--and after reviewing some offers from publishers, ultimately decided that crowdfunding the first two issues of their new comic series would be the best route... </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Mission</span></p>
<div>The 732nd<i> </i>has one mission: to save humanity by defeating the hordes of undead. The creators of <i>Zombiraq:War of the Undead</i> have another: to entertain the audience with beautiful artwork, original storylines, and rich character development. That should be the goal of any comic book or graphic novel, right? </div>
<div><div>
<p>Today, the average American can't turn on the TV or browse the web without seeing images of death and destruction--some of which is obvious fear mongering  from politicians and the media. <i>Zombiraq </i>merges Middle America's topical fear of a violent terrorist organization with the nightmare-inducing images of the dead rising from the graves to feast on the living. </p>
<p>Honestly, what could be more frightening than a zombie wearing a suicide vest?</p>
<p>Using his firsthand experience of combat, Dylan employs the drama and intensity of warfare with the horror of an impending zombie apocalypse.  But no comic is complete without artwork that evokes emotion. Dan's attention to detail and vibrant coloring brings the words to life--or death, if you will. </p>
<p><i>Zombiraq </i>seeks to provide comic book fans with a unique take on the ever popular horror narrative.  </p>
</div></div>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why We Need Your Help...</span></h3>
<div>Simply put, producing and releasing quality work is expensive. And publishers often take advantage of first-time authors because of this. Without going into too much detail, a lot of book publishers offer new writers contracts that leave them at a severe disadvantage--small advances, low royalty percentages, and perhaps most importantly, the author often loses the rights to their own work. </div>
<div>At first glance, one might ask, ""Why do you need $10k to produce a comic series?"" Here's the answer: $10k isn't even for the entire comic series, it's simply to produce the first double-issue. </div>
<div>The breakdown: Before printing fees and shipping fees, the artist needs to be paid first. The current market rate for a professional comic book illustrator is $200-300/page. So, for two 30-page issues, you're already looking at $12,000--on the low end. Add another $2,000 for printing costs, $1,000 for shipping, and you can see that we're not in this to ""get rich quick."" We really just want the world to see and enjoy our work without having to sell our souls (and rights) to a giant corporation.  </div>
<p>We have plans to release an original 6-issue comic book series. But that doesn't happen without a tremendous start. With your help, we can/will do that.</p>

<p>We're offering several amazing perks for different levels of contribution, starting with high resolution digital copies of our special edition double-issue debut. Rewards also include: signed printed hard copies of the comic, contributor names in the back of the comic, signed art prints, custom art (send us a portrait and we'll make you a zombie), and we even have a perk where you have a chance to become a character in the comic. </p>
<p>Due to cost, the initial offering of the comic will be a color cover and black and white interior. <b>If we're fortunate enough to make 150% of our goal, we'll offer the comic with a full color cover and interior. </b></p>
<p>On the flip side, even if we don't meet our goal, we will still try and fill all of the orders to the best of our abilities. If not, we'll offer refunds.  We'll take a  loss before we'll cancel an order, but we don't anticipate that happening. <b>  </b></p>

<br/> </div><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","UPDATE!!! - LEGION OF THE UNDEAD SNEAK PEEK: 
After some re-drafts, we're finally finishing up the last few pages of art in the 64-page book. If you contributed at the Legion of the Undead perk level, there's a good chance you might see a zombie that looks familiar. See if you can spot yourself.

 

(Cover page)
Zombiraq: War of the Undead
Some of the oldest accounts of the dead raising from their graves to feast on human flesh can be traced back to the Middle East. During the Golden Age of Islam, a collection of tales called One Thousand and One Nights (sometimes known as Arabian Nights) was compiled. In the early 1700's, those stories were translated and captivated English-speaking audiences for the first time.  
Centuries later, Zombiraq (Pronounced ""Zomb-ee-rok"") tells the story of a specialized Air Force detachment sent to Northern Iraq as reinforcements for a strained infantry company to combat a rising insurgency. When they arrive, they discover the ruthless militant group that they came to eradicate may be the least of their worries. 
Behind the Comic Book
In 2007, Dylan Park spent a life-changing year in Iraq. It was there that he witnessed both the beauty of the human spirit and the horrors of war. The time spent overseas, in some of the most deplorable conditions imaginable, would be the catalyst for his budding writing career. 
One night during a patrol, while seeking shelter within the walls of an ancient cemetery, he pondered to himself how a graveyard could feel like the safest place in that country. It was an eye-opening epiphany that highlighted how atrocious one's circumstances really could be--admittedly, conditions that were previously foreign to Dylan. With the right combination of imagination, fatigue, and fear, it was there, in that graveyard, where the idea for Zombiraq was dreamt up. 
After completing his 6-year stint in the military, graduating from film school, and gaining real world experience in Los Angeles, Dylan decided he wanted to put his story on paper.  He developed a colorful universe, wrote the manuscript, and sought to find the right artist for the job. Following countless hours of research, he finally found an illustrator who fit perfectly with the project--Daniel Reneau. Not only is Dan a phenomenal artist, he shared an excitement for the project that was integral.  
The two exchanged hundreds of emails--story ideas, concept art, everything--and after reviewing some offers from publishers, ultimately decided that crowdfunding the first two issues of their new comic series would be the best route... 
 
 

 
The Mission
The 732nd has one mission: to save humanity by defeating the hordes of undead. The creators of Zombiraq:War of the Undead have another: to entertain the audience with beautiful artwork, original storylines, and rich character development. That should be the goal of any comic book or graphic novel, right? 

Today, the average American can't turn on the TV or browse the web without seeing images of death and destruction--some of which is obvious fear mongering  from politicians and the media. Zombiraq merges Middle America's topical fear of a violent terrorist organization with the nightmare-inducing images of the dead rising from the graves to feast on the living. 
Honestly, what could be more frightening than a zombie wearing a suicide vest?
Using his firsthand experience of combat, Dylan employs the drama and intensity of warfare with the horror of an impending zombie apocalypse.  But no comic is complete without artwork that evokes emotion. Dan's attention to detail and vibrant coloring brings the words to life--or death, if you will. 
Zombiraq seeks to provide comic book fans with a unique take on the ever popular horror narrative.  

The Creative Team 

Dylan Park - Creator, Writer - Dylan currently lives in Santa Monica, CA, where he is participating in a fellowship at AMC Networks (note: he is a self-proclaimed Walking Dead fanboy, and this is his dream gig) and learning the intricacies of the television writing and development process. After serving in the military for 6 years,  he graduated from Arizona State with a BA in Film and Media, and is currently finishing grad school at the University of Southern California. 

Daniel Reneau - Artist, Letterer, and Colorist - Daniel is a Denver-based illustrator who is skilled in a variety of artistic disciplines and genres, using both traditional and digital mediums, with a focus on comic book art along with sci-fi and fantasy illustration. He is a winner of the 2013 L. Ron Hubbard Illustrators of the Future award, as well as the first place winner of the ‘Super 8 Comic Contest’, which was sponsored and juried by Paramount Pictures and DC Comics.



 


Why We Need Your Help...
Simply put, producing and releasing quality work is expensive. And publishers often take advantage of first-time authors because of this. Without going into too much detail, a lot of book publishers offer new writers contracts that leave them at a severe disadvantage--small advances, low royalty percentages, and perhaps most importantly, the author often loses the rights to their own work. 
At first glance, one might ask, ""Why do you need $10k to produce a comic series?"" Here's the answer: $10k isn't even for the entire comic series, it's simply to produce the first double-issue. 
The breakdown: Before printing fees and shipping fees, the artist needs to be paid first. The current market rate for a professional comic book illustrator is $200-300/page. So, for two 30-page issues, you're already looking at $12,000--on the low end. Add another $2,000 for printing costs, $1,000 for shipping, and you can see that we're not in this to ""get rich quick."" We really just want the world to see and enjoy our work without having to sell our souls (and rights) to a giant corporation.  
We have plans to release an original 6-issue comic book series. But that doesn't happen without a tremendous start. With your help, we can/will do that.
 
 


Now The Fun(d) Part
We're offering several amazing perks for different levels of contribution, starting with high resolution digital copies of our special edition double-issue debut. Rewards also include: signed printed hard copies of the comic, contributor names in the back of the comic, signed art prints, custom art (send us a portrait and we'll make you a zombie), and we even have a perk where you have a chance to become a character in the comic. 
Due to cost, the initial offering of the comic will be a color cover and black and white interior. If we're fortunate enough to make 150% of our goal, we'll offer the comic with a full color cover and interior. 
On the flip side, even if we don't meet our goal, we will still try and fill all of the orders to the best of our abilities. If not, we'll offer refunds.  We'll take a  loss before we'll cancel an order, but we don't anticipate that happening.

We love DJ Dirty Brown, and we think you will too.  We've made the first comic ""DJ Dirty Brown"" with stunning art by Yishan Li and our second is ready to print.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello and thank you for stopping by! I'm James Bowers and I'm the writer of My Dad, Death. I've been writing for a number of years now and have published two novels. I've always wanted to venture into the world of comic books and have had a very healthy pull list for nearly as long as I've been writing. The idea of My Dad, Death has been gestating since I myself was at high school. I always knew I wanted to bring the supernatural to the real weirdness of growing up but until February of 2016 I didn't know the best way to bring it to life. Then I came across Michelle. Her artwork was very unique and I thought it matched the quirky theme of the story rather well. I chanced my arm and approached her. A funny thing happened. She believed in the project too! A budding collaboration blossomed. </p>
<p>Michelle Henderson is a Scottish based professional artist and like me, this is her first time working on a full comic book series this involved. She's worked as an artist for a number of years under her Tengu Arts umbrella and can be found working diligently through DeviantArt, Facebook and Twitter. She's awesome and is available for commission.</p>
<p>Our editor is none other than my awesome and supportive wife Natalie who is qualified to do so because she can be painfully straight up about critiques (which as much as they sting we need to make it as good as it can be), has an English Degree and used to write for a magazine publication. </p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is to get the series onto it's feet by raising enough money to get the first issue into production and into your hands. We have four issues scripted and nearly two years of episodic storytelling to get underway and we'd love for you to experience it from the start. So, what is My Dad, Death and why should you care?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470250136/msibqxbn7vy9np6vgt5c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>Orion Grymm is just an average, nerdy high school kid who learns his father is the Grim Reaper. Unfortunately for Orion, the role of Grim Reaper is hereditary and now he must train to take over the mantle. The downside; he's not a quick learner and he hasn't got the best teacher. Orion's been given just 6 months to be up to scratch. This could be a problem, especially when his new boss Satan is keeping a close eye on him. Should Isaac and Orion Grymm begin to miss souls, even whilst training, the wayward ones could open up a seam that allows the tormented creatures of hell to leak back into the mortal realm. My Dad, Death is a comic series set in a not too distant future, in a fictional city. It is a dark comedy, dimension hopping adventure that never takes itself too seriously but that won't come at the cost of telling a good story. The project was influenced by the Discworld series, Dan Slott's Spider-Man, Deadpool, I Hate Fairyland, Paper Girls, Gwenpool, Game of Thrones and Black Adder. The series will be a commentary on the real weirdness of the world we live in, how not too distant future technology could affect our lives and how death doesn't have to be the end.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need is your support, trust and anticipation. The target we are aiming for will raise enough money to pay for the artwork and printing costs (and perk fulfilment). My day job is working social media and website literature for a quirky print company so the printing costs are pretty fair because of staff discount (woohoo). </p>
<p>The perks you'll get for supporting us range from digital issues of the comic to printed and signed issues, exclusive artwork, exclusive Q&amp;A videos, you getting to be a character in the series, exclusive progress updates, unique custom artwork and your name at the back of each issue.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our full goal we will do our best to still bring My Dad, Death to you. Dependent on the costs involved and the amount we receive there is a few different ways we can go. We could go digital only, so no print run, or shorten the size of the issue to try and tell a one shot engaging story. So no matter how well we do, you'll still be getting a My Dad, Death, independent comic, shaped fix in your life.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact you'll make by helping us reach our goal will be almost unexplainable for us. You'll make this old comic book nerd's dream come true of actually bringing one to life. Indiegogo actually state for this section that I have to 'explain how this project will be valuable to the contributor and the world'. Well, I'm no megalomaniac but I would love to share our stories with the world and Michelle's artwork too. She deserves more exposure. I hope, if we are fortunate enough to pull this off, that it will inspire other independent writers and artists to do the same and chase their dream. Hey if we can do it then, there is no magic formula, anyone can! The dream would be to write comics for a living and getting this comic published would be a HUGE step in that direction and it would get our foot in the door. Down the line we could add more titles to our back catalogue and then eventually be welcoming other creative teams to join us in founding a publishing house (but that's way down the line in fantasy land). At least you know we're not short on ambition.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenge with raising funds via Indiegogo means that if we reach our goal, once that money is gone it is gone and it will only cover producing the first issue. We do have a plan (you'll be pleased to hear) to keep the series going. If we reach our target then we will approach Indie Publisher Alterna who specialise in supporting Indie comics. It's the best of both worlds as we'll retain the freedom of an Indie venture but with the exposure and backing of a publisher. With Alterna we will still need to fund the series and we plan to do this through the monthly crowdfunding subscription service <a href=""http://patreon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patreon</a> (after issue one is already in your hands). </p>
<p>We are already getting good feedback through social media and have even been recognised (surprisingly) by people within the comic book industry. It's a weird world we live in and it's about to get weirder. Should the first few issues require additional funding I am prepared to put in all I can to make this a success.</p>

<p>Hey, you don't have to contribute at all. The fact you've read this far is awesome enough. Even if you can't or would rather not contribute, we would greatly appreciate you sharing this campaign with friends and family who may be interested. Spreading the world would be assistance enough and we'd send good vibes and warm hugs your way.</p>
</div></div>","Summary
Hello and thank you for stopping by! I'm James Bowers and I'm the writer of My Dad, Death. I've been writing for a number of years now and have published two novels. I've always wanted to venture into the world of comic books and have had a very healthy pull list for nearly as long as I've been writing. The idea of My Dad, Death has been gestating since I myself was at high school. I always knew I wanted to bring the supernatural to the real weirdness of growing up but until February of 2016 I didn't know the best way to bring it to life. Then I came across Michelle. Her artwork was very unique and I thought it matched the quirky theme of the story rather well. I chanced my arm and approached her. A funny thing happened. She believed in the project too! A budding collaboration blossomed. 
Michelle Henderson is a Scottish based professional artist and like me, this is her first time working on a full comic book series this involved. She's worked as an artist for a number of years under her Tengu Arts umbrella and can be found working diligently through DeviantArt, Facebook and Twitter. She's awesome and is available for commission.
Our editor is none other than my awesome and supportive wife Natalie who is qualified to do so because she can be painfully straight up about critiques (which as much as they sting we need to make it as good as it can be), has an English Degree and used to write for a magazine publication. 
This Indiegogo campaign is to get the series onto it's feet by raising enough money to get the first issue into production and into your hands. We have four issues scripted and nearly two years of episodic storytelling to get underway and we'd love for you to experience it from the start. So, what is My Dad, Death and why should you care?

The Story
Orion Grymm is just an average, nerdy high school kid who learns his father is the Grim Reaper. Unfortunately for Orion, the role of Grim Reaper is hereditary and now he must train to take over the mantle. The downside; he's not a quick learner and he hasn't got the best teacher. Orion's been given just 6 months to be up to scratch. This could be a problem, especially when his new boss Satan is keeping a close eye on him. Should Isaac and Orion Grymm begin to miss souls, even whilst training, the wayward ones could open up a seam that allows the tormented creatures of hell to leak back into the mortal realm. My Dad, Death is a comic series set in a not too distant future, in a fictional city. It is a dark comedy, dimension hopping adventure that never takes itself too seriously but that won't come at the cost of telling a good story. The project was influenced by the Discworld series, Dan Slott's Spider-Man, Deadpool, I Hate Fairyland, Paper Girls, Gwenpool, Game of Thrones and Black Adder. The series will be a commentary on the real weirdness of the world we live in, how not too distant future technology could affect our lives and how death doesn't have to be the end.


What We Need & What You Get
What we need is your support, trust and anticipation. The target we are aiming for will raise enough money to pay for the artwork and printing costs (and perk fulfilment). My day job is working social media and website literature for a quirky print company so the printing costs are pretty fair because of staff discount (woohoo). 
The perks you'll get for supporting us range from digital issues of the comic to printed and signed issues, exclusive artwork, exclusive Q&A videos, you getting to be a character in the series, exclusive progress updates, unique custom artwork and your name at the back of each issue.
If we don't reach our full goal we will do our best to still bring My Dad, Death to you. Dependent on the costs involved and the amount we receive there is a few different ways we can go. We could go digital only, so no print run, or shorten the size of the issue to try and tell a one shot engaging story.

<p><strong>Greetings, I am the artist TimeBomb100 and my project, Amerikkkan Slaughterhouse(ASH), is a great fictional tale of a post Apocalyptic Civil war in which the fate of an egalitarian world rest on the shoulders of two children, Prince A'tu, and Princess Genisis. Each page of ASH is a sci-fi adventure into the highly unexplored world of AFRO-STEAMPUNK.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This story involves a Post-Apocalyptic America approximately 1,000 yrs from now.  A nuclear storm has devastated the Earth and was brought about by a global war and an American leader who promised to “MAKE AMRICA GREAT AGAIN”! </strong></p>
<p><strong>The remaining survivors of the 3rd world attempt to enter America, as it stands as the only bastion of the old world. A “Great Wall” prevents any foreign “Mongrels” from doing so.</strong></p>
<p><strong>America’s elite (those with an abundance of wealth and resources) flee to the Arctic, and into an 80 ton fire, bomb, gas, and radiation proof vault called “Valhalla”.  While there, they genetically graft new bodies for themselves in order to survive the environmental crisis.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Emerging 600 yrs. Later, the IP’s (Ice People) are the new ruling class. Taller, faster, and stronger than the rest of humanity, these highly enhanced meta-beings, along with their advanced senses, animal instincts, nocturnal eyesight, and elemental capabilities are the new predators of the Earth. </strong></p>
<p><strong>After establishing the N.A.U. (New American Union), The I.P’s (Ice People) create a cast system in order to categorize and rule all others. The cast system consist of Class 1(the Gifted), Class 2(General Laborers), Class 3(The ""Jesters""-people who provide sports, entertainment, and work dead-end jobs), Class 4(Slaves), and finally, those who live outside of America's ""Great Wall"" and have been purged from the caste system...""The MONGRELITES!""</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Scouting the Outlands(the lands outside of American borders),  two wealthy tycoons by the names of Lord Sirus J. Wingate and Lord Chester O’Malley, come into possession of the two surviving children  of a purged group,..Prince A’tuu and Princess Genisis.  The two tycoons develop plans to breed the pair into an exploited species and used as “pets” for the elite, or as fighters in grueling blood sports. It is completely forbidden to allow “purged” groups into the N.A.U., as they may pose a security threat to the new order.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Out of nowhere, a small band of Mercenaries and assassins emerge from the shadows of the underground to rescue he two children. Known as “the Final Kut (FK)”, this miniature army are the final decadence of a condemned group!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ruthless and vengeful, the “FK” consist of the highly skilled Lady Kmaat Fatale, the genius Professor Dunbar (Banneker-II), the comedic Coon-C, Doobie, Jamie Turquoise, Phoenix Blak, General Ezra El Marcos, Termite, and the most indestructible being known to man… DOC WOMACK!</strong></p>
<p><strong>A national emergency is declared as a great showdown is pending between America’s past (the “FK”) and America’s future (the IP’s). The entire fate of humanity lay on the prophesized transition of power foretold of TWO YOUNG CHILDREN.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>This campaign is important due to its level of diversity it conveys as well as its accurate depiction of unapologetic African-American experiences in future decades. ASH serves as both an entity of entertainment as well as a great moment of reflection as it parodies society's imperfections. Contributors will receive the first 12 copies based on the amount of donations, as well as t-shirts, banners and other merchandise from Black Death World Media. I'm currently looking for $1500 in funding. These funds are needed to offset expenses for professional pencilers, inkers, colorist, page editors, publishing and mass distribution.  Although subject matter is edgy due to its ambitious goal of taking on social issues that have plagued this society from its inception, it is import in human evolution to address these matters in order to grow beyond them. This epic sci-fi/social parody follows the same tradition in story telling as The Matrix, Planet of the Apes, and Avatar.</strong></p>

<h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>December 2016, while enduring the harsh Nebraska winter, I began writing a story. This story is much like the stories and shows we grew up watching on Toonami. However, this story differs from those in many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Aaron, but some may also know me as Phelps Vigier. I'm originally from Houston, TX, but I've spent some time dwelling in several other places on this earth: Florida, Kuwait, Nebraska, but for now, I'm back in Texas.</li>
<li>If you're anything like me, you grew up watching several animes including super-human beings achieving peace thru several random ballads of terror. DBZ, Yu Yu Hakusho, Pokemon, Sailormoon, Ronin Warriors.. But have you ever had the urge to create an anime of your own?  Problem is, I'm not Japanese. I'm just a half Black, half Mexican American citizen with a hyperactive imagination. But why would I let that stop me? I would like to introduce to you, my friends, <i><u>XX Zonbi</u></i> , the graphic novel.</li>
<li>Every cent contributed is a cent closer to the completion of this graphic novel, which in good time, will be pitched as an animated series. And honestly guys, I cant do it without you...</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Help me make history..</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I'm hoping to raise at least $5,000... That will be enough to illustrate, build a following through marketing strategy, and ensure <i><u>XX Zonbi</u></i> is completed in its entirety!</li>
<li>Once we establish a solid fan base, I'll launch an assault-style campaign to acquiring funding from a major anime studio such as Funimation </li>
<li>But with your contribution, you deserve some token of appreciation. Therefore, I have established a tier system that rewards you based on your contribution. They will range between $5 - $250... For $5, I can assure you that I deeply appreciate you. For $250 you can become a character in the story line! All this and much more, check the <strong>Perks </strong>section for more information!</li>
<li>An in the event that I do not reach my $5,000 goal, I will still invest whatever I have raised towards this book and do everything I can to stay on schedule. All perks are still promised and will be delivered when available. I will not fail.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a vital step to realizing my ultimate dream:</p>
<ul><li>An average 25min anime episode costs approximately $200,000... And honestly, I don't have that type of money. But if i can achieve this initial goal, urban and Japanese hybrid animated programs could become the future of television. Imagine having more than just The Boondocks... </li></ul>

<p>From 1992 to 2013, we published Tripwire as a print magazine. Publishing more than 55 issues in print including annuals in the summer, plus two anniversary books (Tripwirex10 in 2002 and Tripwire at 21 in 2013), Tripwire covered every major comics and genre writer, producer, artist and mover and shaker. From Guillermo del Toro to Frank Miller, Joss Whedon to Matt Groening, Mike Mignola to Alan Moore, Tripwire was there to cover their work and their career.</p>

<p>It started life as a black and white fanzine but became a full colour magazine in 2003. We were the first people to cover DC’s influential Vertigo imprint, interviewing seminal creators like Grant Morrison, Peter Milligan, Frank Quitely, Jamie Delano and many more. We dropped music which we introduced back in 1992 and replaced it with film and TV in 1999.</p>

<p>In fact there is far too much in the issue to list it all here.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to us because it will allow us to return to the format that garnered us our international reputation. Creating for the web is amazing because it offers immediacy and the opportunity to share content instantly but there is something unique about having a physical, tangible object you can hold in your hand. So those who support us here will allow us to achieve this goal and help us to create new quality print journalism. We intend to return to the production values that we achieved with our Annuals from 2007 to 2011, creating an object that is accessible but that people want to have in their possession.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>We have worked out that we require £13,000 from this campaign. We have broken down our expenses that we require to make this work:</p>
<p>We need £4500 to print the magazine. This will allow us to print 144 pages in full colour at the sort of quality we need to offer the full impact of the issue, printing 2000 copies with 1000 copies featuring the Dan Mora Once &amp; Future cover that only people who support us here will get.</p>
<p>We require £2000 to pay an editor and a designer for the project. Editing, commissioning and designing 144 pages is a huge undertaking and the person who does this will need to be paid properly.</p>
<p>We need £1500 to create the unique perks we are offering in this campaign like badges, T-shirts, unique prints featuring Tripwire covers past and present featuring work from the likes of <strong>Walter Simonson</strong>, <strong>Frank Miller</strong>, <strong>Mike Mignola</strong>, a print with our current cover by David Michael Beck and others and other really cool stuff.</p>
<p>We need a further £1000 to pay a number of journalists who will write some of the articles contained in the issue. These writers are all professionals and this is their career and so we feel it is essential they get paid properly for their work.</p>
<p>We also need a further £4000 to get the various perks out to all of our supporters through a professional fulfilment company.</p>
<p>If we don’t hit our entire target, then we would send out the perks ourselves rather than using a fulfilment company and look at scaling back how many we would print. Plus we would also look at saving money by paying the editor and designer a little less.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The return of Tripwire to print would see quality print journalism back in an industry where this is harder to find than it used to be. Tripwire has always been proud of creating magazines in print and it would allow us to do this again. It would also hopefully act as a springboard to allow us to return to publishing the magazine on a regular basis again. It would also act as a showcase for creative people’s unique work in print rather than online, offering a glimpse behind the creation process.</p>
<p>We published 55 issues and we garnered a lot of notable fans in the world of comics and genre. Oscar winning director and writer Guillermo Del Toro (<strong>The Shape Of Water</strong>) said this about Tripwire:”Tripwire has been for nearly three decades the touchstone of comic book culture in the U.K and one of the leading periodicals dedicated to this narrative art form. Incisive, smart and always relevant.”</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584006765/sgvfbug90tsextk7jpnn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Best selling author Ian Rankin (Rebus) was equally effusive: “ Still the coolest magazine on the planet, and helping young and old alike fritter away their lives with the best coverage of comics, film and TV.”</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584006414/lvnwcltsgdyhbghm7hou.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Legendary TV writer and producer Mark Verheiden (<strong>Ash vs The Evil Dead, Daredevil</strong>) was also one of our biggest fans: “TRIPWIRE is essential reading - one of the best on the market”</p>
<p>Finally fantasy grandmaster Michael Moorcock (Elric) had this to say about us: “TRIPWIRE really is a breath of fresh air. Its layouts are superb, with great well-written features perfectly set off by the pictures, adding clarity and intelligence to every page. And it keeps on doing it. Amazing, gratifying. A pleasure to look at, a pleasure to read.”</p>

<p>Our decades in publishing, both print and online, and our involvement over the past three years with the successful <strong>Portsmouth Comic Con</strong>, means that we feel confident we can deliver a great project. We are also keen to reestablish Tripwire as an advocate and champion of all aspects of pop culture artforms. We do what no other magazine does and we shall continue to do that here.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong><br/>We know life is tough at the moment and print faces a lot of different challenges. However, we feel that our enthusiasm and love for comics and genre and our almost thirty years experience will allow us to deliver what we have promised here. We know every key figure and mover and shaker in the worlds of comics and genre and feel that this will help us to succeed here. We also know people who run websites and magazines who cover the worlds of comics and genre so they will help us get the word out. So they will help us either to share this campaign online or even in some cases they will kindly contribute to the campaign. So we feel more than up for the challenges as we produced a magazine for many years in the past and these are skills which we continue to hone. The team at Tripwire including writers who have worked for places like NME, The Guardian and more, are prepared for whatever hurdles we have to overcome. We have also solicited a direct market edition so we can get income from those copies sold and also done a deal to offer a digital edition through Comixology which will help our revenue for the magazine.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Even if people can’t contribute financially to our campaign, they can still help us. They can share it online via Twitter, Facebook or other forms of social media. They can plug it on their blog or their website if they have one. Thanks for reading and watching our video and thanks for your time.</p>

Looking for a way to tap into the magic one more time, I started writing the story that would coalesce into SUPER TEAM INTERNATIONAL! It's a self-contained universe in six issues, telling the tale of a team of heroes with hearts as big as their inexperience. While I knew what the story was going to be, I didn't know who it was going to be about beyond a couple of superheroes I've had in my back pocket for a while.</p><p>That's where my kids came in. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585424654/udc6dzpswirs463e8xa4.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Sebastian and Samantha have been blossoming into delightfully, creative little powerhouses as a direct result of current day superhero movies and anime (we're looking at you, Marvel and Kodansha). Over the years, I had found character ideas scribbled in their notebooks and on scraps of paper and on their tablets, and some of it has been utterly brilliant. We took the best ones, heroes and villains, mixed in a few public domain characters, and then when I added mine to the mix, we had a working cast to star in the comic!</p><p>Next up was finding the right artist to bring them to life. That's where Carlos Diaz came in. I've known him for several years and worked with him on a few projects in that time. I'll let him tell his story:</p><p>As soon as I read the script and saw the logo, I had a strange feeling of nostalgia and euphoria. I knew we were thinking about the same thing: The Giffen Justice League,and the classic post-Crisis stories of the bronze and early modern age ... you know, when the comics were fun and there were no limits to the imagination! That is really what SUPER TEAM INTERNATIONAL is all about. </p><p>Every time that I sat in front of the PC to work, I was excited as a boy, especially when Scott sent me directions to shape the characters. I can't tell you how much fun it was to dress Buck Gallus like as human chicken and turn his old el Camino into the Chicken Mobile. MR CHICKEN is the kind of hero that you doesn´t know if you should hug or offer him a bowl of soup. It was also a challenge to mold DEEP TRENCH's fish face... or draw a worm with an Ipad! When I was drawing the last details to the KING OF ALL EVIL DRAGON's face, I could hear him speaking. It was strange, but he spoke to me with his gritty voice while raising one of his sinister eyebrows. I designed each character to be unique from his physiognomy to his posture because each of them has a different story and motivation.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585424783/aukdfd39euxw8nye9vjs.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Once the character design was finished, I immersed myself in drawing each page. I tried to give a more classic style to be more in line with the climate of the story, a sequence of action scenes with funny dialogues. STI is not only about drawing men and women in spandex suits doing heroic poses. There are also other different characters in STI, such as Donutopia. Forget the Hall of Justice or Avenger's Tower, a donut shop is the best place where your favorite heroes can meet. In short, it´s a pleasure to draw this story full of heroes and villains with hilarious touches. I hope you, dear readers, can enjoy it as much as I do!</p><p>MORE ABOUT CARLOS</p><p>Born in Buenos Aires four decades ago, Carlos’ life was changed forever the day he picked up The Flashvolume 2, #3, for first time. That’s when he knew he’d be a comic artist for the rest of his life. Carlos has collaborated on short stories for anthologies in Argentina and around the world, and in 2017, he won a national prize as writer for the graphic novel ""Tupac"". Carlos works as a storyboard artist for advertising agencies and film producers, but the comics were, are, and always will be his greatest passion!</p><p>MORE ABOUT SCOTT</p><p>Born and bred in rural Alabama, the earliest known photo of Scott O. Brown is at age two, reading the Sunday comics on the back of a pick-up truck. It wasn’t long before he discovered comic books proper and embarked on a career creating and helping others create comics and graphic novels. Winner of the Harvey and Independent Publisher awards, Scott is a veritable Man of ComicsTM, and has been writing, lettering, and producing comics for the industry since 1999!</p><p>MORE ABOUT SEBASTIAN AND SAMANTHA</p><p>Twins and burgeoning creative powerhouses in their own right, Sebastian and Samantha Brown started with single page photocopies that they sold for a quarter at the Small Press Expo.

V.I.L.E., under the leadership of The King of All Evil Dragons, is done messing around and ready to rid the world of heroes once and for all. Little does either team know that a greater threat grows in the background! SUPR TEAM INT'L is a celebration and return to the style of those awesome Bronze and Modern Age Comics of the 80's with a 2020 flair.Carlos and I grew up on classic DC and Marvel comics on opposite sides of the hemisphere, and their influence runs thick! Looking for a way to tap into the magic one more time, I started writing the story that would coalesce into SUPER TEAM INTERNATIONAL! It's a self-contained universe in six issues, telling the tale of a team of heroes with hearts as big as their inexperience. While I knew what the story was going to be, I didn't know who it was going to be about beyond a couple of superheroes I've had in my back pocket for a while.That's where my kids came in. Sebastian and Samantha have been blossoming into delightfully, creative little powerhouses as a direct result of current day superhero movies and anime (we're looking at you, Marvel and Kodansha). Over the years, I had found character ideas scribbled in their notebooks and on scraps of paper and on their tablets, and some of it has been utterly brilliant. We took the best ones, heroes and villains, mixed in a few public domain characters, and then when I added mine to the mix, we had a working cast to star in the comic!Next up was finding the right artist to bring them to life. That's where Carlos Diaz came in. I've known him for several years and worked with him on a few projects in that time. I'll let him tell his story:As soon as I read the script and saw the logo, I had a strange feeling of nostalgia and euphoria. I knew we were thinking about the same thing: The Giffen Justice League,and the classic post-Crisis stories of the bronze and early modern age ... you know, when the comics were fun and there were no limits to the imagination! That is really what SUPER TEAM INTERNATIONAL is all about. Every time that I sat in front of the PC to work, I was excited as a boy, especially when Scott sent me directions to shape the characters. I can't tell you how much fun it was to dress Buck Gallus like as human chicken and turn his old el Camino into the Chicken Mobile. MR CHICKEN is the kind of hero that you doesn´t know if you should hug or offer him a bowl of soup. It was also a challenge to mold DEEP TRENCH's fish face... or draw a worm with an Ipad! When I was drawing the last details to the KING OF ALL EVIL DRAGON's face, I could hear him speaking. It was strange, but he spoke to me with his gritty voice while raising one of his sinister eyebrows. I designed each character to be unique from his physiognomy to his posture because each of them has a different story and motivation.  Once the character design was finished, I immersed myself in drawing each page. I tried to give a more classic style to be more in line with the climate of the story, a sequence of action scenes with funny dialogues. STI is not only about drawing men and women in spandex suits doing heroic poses. There are also other different characters in STI, such as Donutopia. Forget the Hall of Justice or Avenger's Tower, a donut shop is the best place where your favorite heroes can meet. In short, it´s a pleasure to draw this story full of heroes and villains with hilarious touches. I hope you, dear readers, can enjoy it as much as I do!MORE ABOUT CARLOSBorn in Buenos Aires four decades ago, Carlos’ life was changed forever the day he picked up The Flashvolume 2, #3, for first time. That’s when he knew he’d be a comic artist for the rest of his life. Carlos has collaborated on short stories for anthologies in Argentina and around the world, and in 2017, he won a national prize as writer for the graphic novel ""Tupac"". Carlos works as a storyboard artist for advertising agencies and film producers, but the comics were, are, and always will be his greatest passion!MORE ABOUT SCOTTBorn and bred in rural Alabama, the earliest known photo of Scott O. Brown is at age two, reading the Sunday comics on the back of a pick-up truck. It wasn’t long before he discovered comic books proper and embarked on a career creating and helping others create comics and graphic novels. Winner of the Harvey and Independent Publisher awards, Scott is a veritable Man of ComicsTM, and has been writing, lettering, and producing comics for the industry since 1999!MORE ABOUT SEBASTIAN AND SAMANTHATwins and burgeoning creative powerhouses in their own right, Sebastian and Samantha Brown started with single page photocopies that they sold for a quarter at the Small Press Expo. They created many of the characters in STI ’88 and co-wrote the plot. This is their first comic book.We hope you are as excited about this foray into classic superhero storytelling as we are!

<h3>About the Author and the Storybook</h3>
<ul>
<li>I’m a family man of over twenty years and the father of two children. I’ve spent over two decades in product development/marketing and sales. I’m an artist with nearly thirty years’ experience in animation, special effects, 3D design and dubious voice-over work. I enjoy the creative process and developing projects to their completion.</li>
<li>When my Navy veteran grandfather reached the last years of his life, I visited him and learned more about his life. After he passed, I created a eulogy and poured over 94 years of his life in pictures. It was amazing. Sometimes we don't get to say goodbye to the ones we love, but the time you spent with them is invaluable.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>In 2015, Overground Comics creator Jon Hughes hit the road and toured the entire west coast of the country telling comic shop owners and comic readers in over 300 different stores about Overground's new line of books that would be coming to stores soon.  The one title that everyone wanted to talk about during the tour was our high risk project, America.  </p>
<p>For our other books, Overground Comics stayed small, and worked with artists who had proven themselves in the independent comic book community, with most of those books being delivered on time and with great results.  </p>
<p>With America, we decided to reach out to some enigmatic talents, and take a chance on making a big splash by landing some big talent.  It worked.  Sort of.  Overground Comics was able to sign outstanding Marvel and DC artist Jason Pearson to draw the first two issues of the book, and fans were excited to see Pearson back to work on a monthly title.  After two issues, however, Jason decided to remove himself from the project, and we were left to find another artist to fill the void.  While we had artists in our studio we knew that we could trust, we knew that fans would want another established artist to fill that void, so the search began.  </p>
<p>We contacted Ale Garza, who like Pearson was a talented, established artist looking for a fresh start.  Fans were again excited to see Garza added to the project, and work began on  finishing the polarizing series.  Unfortunately, Garza was unable to deliver the books before our distribution deadline, and Overground Comics was unable to deliver the fourth and final issue of the book.  After finally receiving the finished pages from Garza, Overground was able to publish the final issue through another independent imprint called American Mythology, but unfortunately, so much time had passed that most readers weren't even aware that the book was available, and order numbers dropped significantly.  </p>
<p>Despite all of the challenges with our small company getting in over our head, we did produce a good book that people responded really well to, and we want everyone to have access to the finished project once and for all.  This campaign finally brings the book together in a graphic novel, with some awesome never before seen bonus material.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For this campaign, we are raising money to print as many copies of the graphic novel as possible, to be sold on tour at conventions across the country.  It's simple.  The work has been done for most of the project, we just now need the funds to print as many copies as we can to be able to get them to everyone who wants one.   Here's a closer look at some of the rewards:</p>

<h3>Why does ""America"" matter?</h3>
<p>A lot of people misunderstood this book when it was produced, largely due to the fractured nature of the delivery of the book, but we believe that this is a book that people will benefit from reading.  Is America an outrageous character?  Yes.  However, her inability to accept the changes in her life is something that we can all relate to, and something that needs to be discussed.  Readers won't simply be entertained by this book, it's an introspective look at who we all really are, and how we respond to unwelcome change.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Honestly, this is an absolutely zero risk campaign.  The book has already been completed, we are simply trying to raise money to print it.  If we only raise enough to print what's purchased through the campaign, then we're okay with that.  We're not trying to overachieve, we're trying to get this book into the hands of the people who have been waiting patiently for it.  All pledges are guaranteed to be rewarded, because nothing really needs to be done except an order being put in to our printer.  That's not difficult.  We just need the funds to pay for it.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Help Us Out!</h3>
<p>If you can't pledge, then please help us out by spreading the word about this project.  We sold thousands of copies of these comics nationwide, and even had the book published overseas, but so many people were left wanting a conclusion they didn't have access to.  Tell your friends and fellow comic readers that now is the time to finish this story!</p>

For this campaign, we are raising money to print as many copies of the graphic novel as possible, to be sold on tour at conventions across the country.  It's simple.  The work has been done for most of the project, we just now need the funds to print as many copies as we can to be able to get them to everyone who wants one.   Here's a closer look at some of the rewards:

Why does ""America"" matter?
A lot of people misunderstood this book when it was produced, largely due to the fractured nature of the delivery of the book, but we believe that this is a book that people will benefit from reading.  Is America an outrageous character?  Yes.  However, her inability to accept the changes in her life is something that we can all relate to, and something that needs to be discussed.  Readers won't simply be entertained by this book, it's an introspective look at who we all really are, and how we respond to unwelcome change.

Risks & Challenges
Honestly, this is an absolutely zero risk campaign.  The book has already been completed, we are simply trying to raise money to print it.  If we only raise enough to print what's purchased through the campaign, then we're okay with that.  We're not trying to overachieve, we're trying to get this book into the hands of the people who have been waiting patiently for it.  All pledges are guaranteed to be rewarded, because nothing really needs to be done except an order being put in to our printer.  That's not difficult.  We just need the funds to pay for it.  

Help Us Out!
If you can't pledge, then please help us out by spreading the word about this project.  We sold thousands of copies of these comics nationwide, and even had the book published overseas, but so many people were left wanting a conclusion they didn't have access to.  Tell your friends and fellow comic readers that now is the time to finish this story!",13.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The following is the opening sequence to Project Shadow Breed:</p>
<ul><li><p>In the new millennia, SinTech, A private government contract corporation, began developing a serum to turn ordinary soldiers into werewolves.  With the backing of the US military, SinTech perfected the serum.  In 2014, they created the first “Wolf Pack” of soldiers.  What they didn’t expect to create was Marrok.</p></li></ul>
<p>If that doesn't setup ""BADASSERY"" (it's a word, look it up. Actually, don't look it up) then we don't know what will.  Project Shadow Breed is the brainchild of Justin Bartz, a writer, a husband, and a father from Michigan.  When he's not spending time with his family, his mind drifts in and out of the world he's creating.</p>
<p>This special issue of Project Shadow Breed is an early sneak peek release of what's to come next.  As a contributor you will get your hands on a copy of Project Shadow Breed before the public release, even those attending comic conventions.  We are not scheduled for conventions till after June.  WooHoo!</p>
<p>Join Justin as he unveils what government contractors create behind closed doors and unleash in the public sector.  Join Marrok (half werewolf, what's that about?) and Leroy (Ex-Military, Mentor, and official Marrok ass-kicker) as they uncover the truth behind Marrok's past (he wasn't always a werewolf you know) and get mixed up in the biggest war that's coming to Seattle. Oh, and they save people too.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Great news!  The book is already complete and ready for print.  Which means we can get books to you faster!  The funds that need to be raised will cover the cost of printing and perks for backers.  This venue allows small publishers in the indie market to thrive and share content on a consistent basis.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Justin Bartz has been developing the Project Shadow Breed world for as long as he can remember.  The passion you hear in his voice when he is talking about this book is undeniable.  There are many stories about vigilantes rising to face the injustice of the world.  However, Justin writes these characters with so much heart and soul that you feel it on every page.</p>
<p>The goal, with your help, is to bring this story to as many people who love storytelling as much Justin and the Amazing Action Comics team does.</p>
<p>As we grow, we'll never forget those who rode this journey with us.  Your names will forever be imbedded in our hearts and in the pages we create.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Any project faces a number of risks and challenges to reach a finished product. We understand the faith that backers will have shown in this project and will be fully committed to bringing Project Shadow Breed to life within the projected timeframe.</p>
<p>We are very much looking forward to taking on the challenge of bringing this project into your homes as early as June 2019.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event of delays We'll keep all backers and interested parties updated, both here, on our website (<a href=""http://www.amazingactioncomic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.amazingactioncomics.com</a>) and via social media. We strongly believe that good, honest communication is the best approach in business and hope that this transmits the level of commitment We have to making this project happen.</p>
<p>Without potential (and more importantly, actual) investors this dream simply wouldn’t occur in the timeframe defined. This is a symbiotic journey of creation. Our vision and time invested is only part of the elements for success, YOU are an important part in making this happen. We sincerely hope you'll join us in this endeavor.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>One of the many cool things about The Book of Jessica is that it is part of a larger Post-Apocalyptic Universe being developed by MWP Comics called The Third Testament Universe. This universe will allow the reader to follow multiple storylines which will highlight many heroes and heroines. Currently, in addition to The Book of Jessica comic series, The Book of Luka graphic novel is in production and will be available in April. The Book of Luka follows the Guardian Luka and his companions in the same universe as Jessica. </p>
<h3>The big picture:</h3>
<p>The Battle of Armageddon has come and gone, leaving a charred and devastated world behind.  There was no rapture, no day of jubilee...only destruction.</p>
<p>In the aftermath, humans possessed by lower demons stalk the desolate landscape devouring souls and flesh alike. In addition to the supernatural evil haunting the world, human scavengers and petty warlords fight over the scraps, challenging even demons in their savagery.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543603702/artb0hicjcrpbbdketcw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>But hope does exist, however small.</p>
<p>Those given special powers by the archangels stand watch over the ever-shrinking flock of humankind. </p>
<p>Guardians, with their increased strength and anointed swords (capable of killing all but high demons) are the watchdogs that defend the citadels. </p>

<p>Far-roaming, stealthy, and possessing deadly speed, Rangers scout the wastelands for  supplies and worthy survivors.    </p>

<p>These warriors, and the flocks they protect, are led by the Bishops. Chosen for their bravery and leadership in the first days of the Apocalypse, they have the power to exercise lower demons and the will to do what must be done in order for those under their care to survive.</p>
<p>Working outside the confines of the warrior-class are the Relic Holders. Given tokens of immense power by the seraphim just prior to the Apocalypse, they carry the weight and pain of their gifts as they forge their own paths to restore the world for mankind.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge is time.  Will MWP get this project out in early 2019 or will we need to wait for other projects to pay off and delay it several months or even into 2020?  This is where your help is vital to maintaining a constant flow of quality comics to fans. </p>
<p>We have set a budget for this project that allows us to create one of the highest quality comic books your going to find out there, indie or otherwise.  That being said, it isn't cheap and your support will be vital to getting this issue complete and out to people. </p>
<p>The writing is done, we have worked with ALL of the artists before on Issue #1 and they are excited about getting started on Issue #2.  </p>

Currently, in addition to The Book of Jessica comic series, The Book of Luka graphic novel is in production and will be available in April. The Book of Luka follows the Guardian Luka and his companions in the same universe as Jessica. 
The big picture:
The Battle of Armageddon has come and gone, leaving a charred and devastated world behind.  There was no rapture, no day of jubilee...only destruction.
In the aftermath, humans possessed by lower demons stalk the desolate landscape devouring souls and flesh alike. In addition to the supernatural evil haunting the world, human scavengers and petty warlords fight over the scraps, challenging even demons in their savagery.

But hope does exist, however small.
Those given special powers by the archangels stand watch over the ever-shrinking flock of humankind. 
Guardians, with their increased strength and anointed swords (capable of killing all but high demons) are the watchdogs that defend the citadels. 

Far-roaming, stealthy, and possessing deadly speed, Rangers scout the wastelands for  supplies and worthy survivors.    

These warriors, and the flocks they protect, are led by the Bishops. Chosen for their bravery and leadership in the first days of the Apocalypse, they have the power to exercise lower demons and the will to do what must be done in order for those under their care to survive.
Working outside the confines of the warrior-class are the Relic Holders. Given tokens of immense power by the seraphim just prior to the Apocalypse, they carry the weight and pain of their gifts as they forge their own paths to restore the world for mankind.  
This is were Jessica comes into play! Here are some pages from Issue #1!

 




 
What We Need & What You Get
This campaign is to support the main artwork, cover art, and initial print run. Here are the numbers:

Principle artwork and cover: $3000.  Pencils/inks by Toni Doya, Colors by David Ocampo, and Letters by Ernesto Lovera.  Cover art by Kevin McCoy. These artists have worked for the likes of Marvel, Image, Zensecope, and even the Seattle Seahawks!
 Initial 500 print run: $900

We've got a ton of perks ranging from PDF copies or paper copies to original art and even having your likeness in a MWP comic or graphic novel!
Our Record

MWP has a record of completing projects at the highest level.  Just take a look at what Mountaineer West Productions has completed or successfully funded in the last 18 months:

Comics/Graphic Novels:
The Book of Luka #1  (From The Third Testament Universe) 

The Book of Luka Graphic Novel. Fully Funded.  (April 2019 Release)

The Book of Jessica #1.  Complete. 

War Angels #1. Fully Funded, Early 2019 release.



Film:
Lions Short Film (Military Scifi) Fully Funded. This film will be in the film festival circuit in 2019. 


Books:
The Gateway Military Scifi series
 
Southern Rites (Southern Gothic Fiction)
Escape of the Relentless (Runan Empire Series #1) - Military Scifi scheduled for January 2019 release


Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge is time.  Will MWP get this project out in early 2019 or will we need to wait for other projects to pay off and delay it several months or even into 2020?  This is where your help is vital to maintaining a constant flow of quality comics to fans. 
We have set a budget for this project that allows us to create one of the highest quality comic books your going to find out there, indie or otherwise.  That being said, it isn't cheap and your support will be vital to getting this issue complete and out to people. 
The writing is done, we have worked with ALL of the artists before on Issue #1 and they are excited about getting started on Issue #2.  

Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>One of the unique perks offered in my campaign is the opportunity to be in the story.  I will have 21 slots available for people.  With that being said, when I create the anime for this story, your character will also be a part of the show.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>By backing this book, you will do more than help me achieve my dream.  You will also create job opportunities for animators, voice actors, sound engineers, video editors and more.</p>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I've read comics and watched anime.  I came up with this story 4 years ago, but after talking to a few comic and manga companies, I've learned that it's a very inclusive environment.  After seeing more and more demand for indie content, I decided to create this book. This book is the first step in my plan to create a new life and embrace my calling.  The funds generated from this campaign will not only allow me to create this book, but also allow me to create a new animation studio.  This gives me and my backers a very unique opportunity. The opportunity to not only be in the book, but the anime as well. </p>

What’s so different about what I’m doing, you ask? Well, I’m creating for a much younger audience than what is today’s beginning readership for comic books, which is 13 to 15 years old.
My characters and stories are for the “Seedlings,” kids who are between 4 to 12 years old. And within that age range I have two specific groupings: 4 to 7, and 8 to 12.
I’m being very specific in my age grouping because as kids grow from 4 to 7 and develop into 8 to 12 year olds, what entertains them also develops and changes.

But can they stop fighting amongst themselves long enough to save the kingdom from tyranny and a moat-load of misogyny?  Actors Carlee Baker (Robot Chicken) and Troy Fromin (Saved By the Bell) co-star in this action & joke-packed sword & sorcery romp, with a special guest appearance by writer/artist Frank Dietz and Cody Cox, a backer from the prior campaign, in a hilariously real scene with Sonya! Written by Todd Livingston & Nick Capetanakis, illustrated by Brendon Fraim & Brian Fraim, and colored by James Couts.Main cover by Best Comic Artists of 2020 nominees Brendon & Brian FraimThis issue is currently featured in Previews (FEB 21) with a scheduled street date of April 2021 - but only the Exclusive perks are available through this Indiegogo campaign.

Newest Model (Work in Progress) 1/2/2015





Short Summary  My goal is to purchase a 3D printer. We are Currently modeling many figures from the series to be 3D printed. Having our own printer would cut down costs for everyone, especially fans and supporters.
   What We Need & What You Get  $500 is the lowest amount you can put on Indiegogo, the amount I need is around $900 for a higher quality printer than what you can buy at Best Buy. I am only asking for partial amount to help me purchase. 100% of funds will towards printer, any extra funds will go towards upgrades and extra color material.
Figures made with new printer will be shipped to people helping with $15 or more. (The Rare Metal figures will be printed by professionals)
Here is the printer I am interested in: 




Amazon Link : Click Here
    The Impact  Your funds will help lower the overall cost and production of these figures. I am personally paying all the up-front costs for indie creator friends of mine to have their own action figure. This will help so many more people other than myself.    Risks & Challenges  There are very few risks involved, I do not see any that could really come up.
With Flexiable funding and goal is not met, I will still make sure your figures will be printed, even if I have to pay someone else to do it.    Other Ways You Can Help  Please help get the word out about this campaign. Indiegogo has amazing share tools!",2.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>What is Patron Comics?</b></span><br/></p>
<p>Hi! I am Anthony James Perez, Publisher of ReginaCaeli Publishing and creator of <b>Patron Comics</b> - a comic book series pegged as 100% entertainment with 100% catechism. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440145894/vbgp9qm5qoezm2oblo5b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I created Patron Comics in order to seamlessly incorporate entertainment with catechism in way that is not too hard sell. Our youth, who are the primary target of the comics, imbibe their catechism better if they see it applied in real-life situations, and real-life situations and characters are what we offer in Patron Comics. </p>
<p>In this confused world where people deny God and the cross, pursue paths of self-destruction like <b>divorce, same-sex marriage, and abortion</b>, we need to reinforce and in many ways restructure the way we teach the catechism to our Catholic brethren, and Patron Comics does precisely that: we tackle these issues, and more, head on, using the light that comes from<b> Sacred Scripture, Magisterium, and Sacred Tradition</b> and in a way that is very entertaining for our readers. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440145447/n8f40qi75jysqa4abzuy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The entry point of our stories, and its main theme is spiritual battle specifically through <b>exorcism</b>. The creative team and covered all the bases to make sure we aren't just making something for cheap thrills; we're here to show that the devil exists, but <i>our aim is not to scare our readers, but to show God's victory over evil</i>. It is also our experience that by talking about the supernatural, we can easily have a captive readership; from there we can deliver the correct catechism regarding topics like ghosts, haunted houses, and occult activities, and, in the case of Book 1, we used this theme in order to emphasize the utter importance of Holy Communion and Confession. </p>

</div><div>
<div>I am in need of <b>25,000 USD</b> or roughly 1.14 million Philippine Pesos in order to create, publish, and print books 1 and 2 of Patron Comics this year, and there are two batches of printing. The first batch, for around 1000 copies, has started this June, and will be printed monthly until March. The second batch, for 8,000 copies, will start late September or early October.The cost is exclusive of the salaries of the administrative staff (I only employ two people at the moment to minimize costs). </div>
<div>This is how the cost is broken down: (cost is in PHP)</div>
<div><u><b>1st Batch</b></u></div>
<div>artists' cost - 33, 000 PHP per issue</div>
<div>printing cost - 27,000 PHP per issue of 1000 copies = 60,000 per issue</div> <p>60,000 PHP per issue x 7 issues remaining = <b>420,000 PHP or around 9000 ++ USD. </b></p>

</div></div>","What is Patron Comics?
Hi! I am Anthony James Perez, Publisher of ReginaCaeli Publishing and creator of Patron Comics - a comic book series pegged as 100% entertainment with 100% catechism. 

I created Patron Comics in order to seamlessly incorporate entertainment with catechism in way that is not too hard sell. Our youth, who are the primary target of the comics, imbibe their catechism better if they see it applied in real-life situations, and real-life situations and characters are what we offer in Patron Comics. 
In this confused world where people deny God and the cross, pursue paths of self-destruction like divorce, same-sex marriage, and abortion, we need to reinforce and in many ways restructure the way we teach the catechism to our Catholic brethren, and Patron Comics does precisely that: we tackle these issues, and more, head on, using the light that comes from Sacred Scripture, Magisterium, and Sacred Tradition and in a way that is very entertaining for our readers. 


The entry point of our stories, and its main theme is spiritual battle specifically through exorcism. The creative team and covered all the bases to make sure we aren't just making something for cheap thrills; we're here to show that the devil exists, but our aim is not to scare our readers, but to show God's victory over evil. It is also our experience that by talking about the supernatural, we can easily have a captive readership; from there we can deliver the correct catechism regarding topics like ghosts, haunted houses, and occult activities, and, in the case of Book 1, we used this theme in order to emphasize the utter importance of Holy Communion and Confession. 
Patron Comics was created with the help of the Archdiocese of Manila Office of Exorcism and is endorsed by several bishops here in the Philippines. 
Breaking the Cost down

I am in need of 25,000 USD or roughly 1.14 million Philippine Pesos in order to create, publish, and print books 1 and 2 of Patron Comics this year, and there are two batches of printing. The first batch, for around 1000 copies, has started this June, and will be printed monthly until March. The second batch, for 8,000 copies, will start late September or early October.The cost is exclusive of the salaries of the administrative staff (I only employ two people at the moment to minimize costs). 
This is how the cost is broken down: (cost is in PHP)
1st Batch
artists' cost - 33, 000 PHP per issue
printing cost - 27,000 PHP per issue of 1000 copies = 60,000 per issue 60,000 PHP per issue x 7 issues remaining = 420,000 PHP or around 9000 ++ USD. 
2nd Batch
artists cost - 0 PHP
printing cost - estimated at 240,000 PHP per issue of 8,000 copies 
240,000 per issue X 3 issues (10 issues consolidated into three to minimize costs) = 720,000 PHP
420,000 + 720,000 = 1,140,000 PHP Total Amount

I appreciate every donation to this cause, big or small. I will take whatever funds that people donate in order to defray the high cost of printing. We need to win the culture back, and I believe that this is a step towards that direction. We have to save souls and we have to be creative in doing so.

<p>I've made most of the original illustrations available as perks for contributions of $100 or $150. Most of the illustrations were created on 9""x12"" art board (these are for $100).

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have already completed the book and sent it to the printer so there are very little risks of this book not coming into existence. However, to pay the printer I did have to take out a loan from a very shady looking fella named Dimitri. Now, if I raise enough money with this campaign I can pay him back, no problem. If I don't well... Dimitri says, ""you no pay me back, I take hand, hand you draw wit."" *gulp* So, there's that risk...</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. The most helpful and easiest way is to spread the word. Social media has the widest reach but word of mouth tends to be the most sincere. Preaching from a street corner might be the least effective but I will applaud the effort of any individual who would like to take it to that extreme. </p>

Ink the Void is about a young boy who is given the task of filling a large endless void with his oversized brush and pail of ink. At first daunted by the task, he soon runs off creating wondrous environments and creatures. However, in his carelessness he unwittingly creates a monstrous ink monster who begins consuming his creations.

What is a GifT Book??





This is an app that is quite different and fun, 


where artists can connect with many readers.




<What can be discovered?> 




The Gift can further deepen artist's info.
 People can discover many different kinds of ideas from the artists. 
They will be able to discover their favorite artists.



<About us>




We are artists who enjoy creating stories.
To share our stories, we even created a website. 
http://www.agora-gacha.net
https://www.facebook.com/AGORA-gacha-185003614906878/


<Our problem>  
This is not a job, rather a place where we enjoy meeting artist friends. 
We hope to create an app to further promote our works, but 
for amateur artists like us, we do not have the budget to engage in such a project.
Thus we would like to create a simple template and share it amongst the artists. 



<Amount needed>   
We need at least 2,500 dollars.
2,100 dollars to develop this app and create a gift page.
and 400 dollars to make the gift.





<Benefits for the donors>   

These days there are many different ways to make purchases.
Therefore buyers can choose a method that best suits them.
Knowing your favorite works or artists can enrich one's life even more.
And in the future,
if we could sell a lot of artist apps, we  will give your investment back to you 
with option money.

<First gift book work>   



""THE CREATURES""






By Takuya Mishina which is a work based on soul.
This is an app that is quite different and fun, where artists can connect with many 
readers!
https://www.facebook.com/takuya347/
http://www.geocities.jp/takuyamac347/



<Target Time of our First App>  
Untill Summer season (2016) We will tell you our process regularly.

<About Perks> 
From Mishina's ""CREATURES"" 




Appreciation message/Digital book/Endroll with individual names/Printbook
/USB /Ice cream/Original Mishina's paint/etc.
(Attention: These perks do not indclude the App. We report our progress status.)

<Introduction of Takuya Mishina>



My name is Takuya Mishina from Japan.
My passion is to create illustration, and comics.
I want to become a professional artist so that the creators and art enthusiasts 
can enjoy my work.
My art is not enough now. In the future,
I want to master and reach the zenith of my art and expression.
Tr.Eugene, Everett


<Risks and Challenges>   

We will do our best to meet the challenge.
Even if we cannot meet the minimum budget,we will do what we can.

If we succeed in this challenge, we will make and develop more applications 
for artists.




<Voice from Artists>

This new app is the foundation of something bigger 
and I'm happy to be a part of it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<h3>Welcome Back to the UVUniverse!</h3>
<p>One year later and 261.4k fans later, we are back and ready to go with our second issue!</p>
<p>This fundraiser is going to help us produce copies of the second issue, move our products into one warehouse and pay our artists for their efforts and time!</p>
<p>The second issue script has been completed, and the team has been working on it for quite some time now!</p>
<p>The feedback on the first issue was AMAZING, and we implemented as many of the requests as we could into this next issue, and are very proud to say that this might be our best one yet!</p>
<p>ULTRAVIOLET: Fun in The Sun </p>
<p>Takes place right after the first issue and the action picks up very quickly, and you get to meet our newest character in the series, Kaja Bylilly! </p>
<p>In this issue, you get to learn the backstory of why UV came to Earth, and what lurks around the corner for Jai!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Once we reach this goal, </p>
<p>We'll be able to start up Twitch streaming again, purchase the second issue in bulk, move all of our products into one big warehouse, and purchase more copies for the first issue to be made as well! The rest of the budget goes to shipping, smaller freebies, and legal fees that may occur for UV!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The Biggest risk is shipping delays, just like last time! </p>
<p>With COVID and its variants spreading around and countries considering lockdowns again, we will do our best to keep everyone updated on the shipping status, and shouldn't have an issue with the ETA's this time being its out second go around!</p>

<h3>Hi There!</h3>
<p>My name is Mason Parker. I am a hip-hop MC, spoken word artist, actor, and content producer. In 2012 I conceptualized ""The Paperback Hero Saga"" as a response to the monotony of the mainstream. Often times in pop culture, the best way to educate is to entertain. With the music industry quickly becoming visual, I viewed it as an excellent opportunity to introduce my comic book to help illustrate the themes discussed in my music.</p>
<p>Now that the project is complete I need you to help me get it to the masses. This project has been a 6 year journey, taking thousands of personally funded dollars, and even moving clear across the country in order to complete. I have put my EVERYTHING into this project and so at this point I proudly present the product of my passion hoping to garner the sincere support of others wanting to perpetuate the love frequency in the art we create and consume. I truly believe this project will change lives for the better. Please help me touch as many people as possible.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So in order to pull this off, we will need a total of $16,500- $20,000 which we have broken down into 3 phases raising a minimum of $5,500 each. The first phase will include producing more visuals to extend the reach of the project, creating merchandise and as much social media and grassroots promotion as we can muster. The second phase will be dedicated to creating more press opportunities, completing the rest of the visuals, and of course, physical copies of the comic book and album. The third phase will be focused on taking PBH Saga on the road!  To show how appreciative we are for your support, we offer several perk packages when you donate over certain amounts. Perks include t-shirts, posters, as well as autographed copies of the CD and comic. Trust me, the more we CAN do, the more we WILL do, so rest assured we plan for the perks to only get bigger and better with each phase!</p>
<p>OK, so you may be asking, ""What if you don't get all the money?"" Well, the money will still go towards our promotional efforts at whatever scale we can afford. Your contribution is valuable to me, and in turn I believe this project will enrich the lives of the people who support it. I believe it's a fresh take on age old principles and truths that impact all of our lives for the better once we understand how they work.</p>
<p>I am so passionate about spreading this to the masses because I believe that not only is this a positive message needed in today's entertainment, but because I believe it will positively impact YOU. So even if you can't contribute financially. Listen to the music. Read the digital comic. Enjoy it, and tell every friend and family member you talk to! Either way, your efforts are going towards a worthy cause and are EXTREMELY appreciated. Please use the Indiegogo and social media share tools to spread the word about what we're doing!</p>

<p><strong>STORY</strong>  </p>
<p>The protagonist Mr. Hopeless is an unsuccessful, weak and slothful everyman, with a body too naïve a pain in the neck of his soul, who eventually leaves him. Having become all the more spiritless now that he lacks a soul, Hopeless notices that he has also grown invisible and that he does not, in the regular sense of the word, even “exist” in the current world which now seems to him a negatively-aesthetic cluster of images. </p>
<p>Accompanying his invisibility is a dog that only he can see, a dog that can randomly multiply and decrease in number. It turns out that the dog(s) will guide him throughout the search for his soul, as a letter that he receives informs us. The letter is from a man who introduces himself as Mr. Spider. The story begins right in the beginning of the protagonist's surreal journey across the Mother Land, a world of fantasy with metaphysical undertones, inhabited mostly by animals: it is the probable shelter of lost souls, but one that torments, psychologically dissects, forces Hopeless to face his background more than it offers a shelter. It is also a journey in which the main character slowly loses his status as a protagonist, not only because it is a place that dismantles established identities, but also it soon becomes apparent that other (animal) characters have deeper stories than the protagonist's. </p>

<p>We attempt to present an enjoyable read. The story includes elements of surreal, black and blue comedy, but first and foremost irrealistic humor with less of an expressionist taste, in a way that challenges and satirizes many recurring questions inherent in modernity, literary conventions and motifs, such as the moralistic undertones in the Faustian canon. Doing all of these in a comic format, in a simplified world that reads like a twisted fable is itself a great challenge to ourselves and the genre in which we apply our methods. You are invited to interpret, revisualize and even complete the universe we offer, while enjoying the read and the artwork (so we hope). </p>

<p>Our target is thus adults who appreciate ambiguity, allegorical/alternative worlds out of their comfort zones, lack of fixated subjectivities. If you strive for liberation but are too conscious of the –global and local – conditions which have generated and continues to structure us beyond our control, then this story might be for you. In a way, we seek people who would not mind letting the gravity of their train of thought and the gusty levity of their chuckle cohabit. As for our format, the non-linerar story arc is optimal for a mini series, since we are more interested in process-driven narratives than Aristotelian structures; however, once it is completed it can be published as a full original graphic novel since it constitutes a whole. It is a colored work, as it is essential for the carnivalesque, grotesque, macabre style of artwork and story.</p>

<p><strong>The Pig</strong></p>
<p>The welcomer of the Mother's Land. A s-s-stutterer with a perpetual grin that grinds your eyes, before the high-pitched swelling of its fragmented words grinds the entire earwax of your own language. The Pig holds a meat grinder, an animated mouth-device that chews the newcomers all the way through the guts of the Land. Yes, entering the Mother's Land is hella painful and you must be literally ground to bits. Hopeless is about to get each of his cells castrated.</p>

<p><strong>Spider, aka Daddy Longlegs</strong></p>
<p>A man of letters. A Platonic dreamer in a dream world. A masochist with an idealized ego that denies reality. An astute producer of guilt in others. Obsessively in love with Blatta.

<p><strong>WHY INDIEGOGO?</strong></p>
<p>Production and shipping costs are a major concern for us, especially because our work appeals to international readers and we do not have any financial support or a sponsor. Indiegogo is a great place to accomplish the projects of the like. If we reach our goal, we offer to share with you a limited edition of the first two episodes of our project which is now complete. Since mass production is not yet an option for us, a limited addition will allow for a high quality work with the cost as minimal as possible. We also kept these factors in mind while carefully selecting rewards.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524393393/gjql36b70ybtvhvhihut.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>

We have had to limit the first edition to only 250 copies in order to fulfill this goal with a realistic budget: We ensure you will have added a painstakingly created product to your collection. Not only will you receive the 88 page colored book and 20"" x 27"" sized coated glossy paper posters including the characters of the first issue, but also fan artworks added to the book (5 additional pages and possibly more). The one you see above was made by Şerif Karasu and you will get the artwork of two more artists in print. We are in the process of creating our characters for the second issue, and you can also get posters including them if you would like to take a peek into what is to come.</p>

You are invited to interpret, revisualize and even complete the universe we offer, while enjoying the read and the artwork (so we hope).

Our target is thus adults who appreciate ambiguity, allegorical/alternative worlds out of their comfort zones, lack of fixated subjectivities. If you strive for liberation but are too conscious of the –global and local – conditions which have generated and continues to structure us beyond our control, then this story might be for you. In a way, we seek people who would not mind letting the gravity of their train of thought and the gusty levity of their chuckle cohabit. As for our format, the non-linerar story arc is optimal for a mini series, since we are more interested in process-driven narratives than Aristotelian structures; however, once it is completed it can be published as a full original graphic novel since it constitutes a whole. It is a colored work, as it is essential for the carnivalesque, grotesque, macabre style of artwork and story.
 
Some Characters of the First Issue
 Hopeless
The would-be protagonist of the story. Invisible, redundant among us. A flour sack dragged, tortured, analyzed, shaken out of his oblivion across the Mother's Land, but has free will as much as we do.

Mr. Four Legs
Hopeless' companion and guide. A mock Virgil and pseudo-Woland. Initially single and mute, he displays a skill to multiply and become a pack.

The Pig
The welcomer of the Mother's Land. A s-s-stutterer with a perpetual grin that grinds your eyes, before the high-pitched swelling of its fragmented words grinds the entire earwax of your own language. The Pig holds a meat grinder, an animated mouth-device that chews the newcomers all the way through the guts of the Land. Yes, entering the Mother's Land is hella painful and you must be literally ground to bits. Hopeless is about to get each of his cells castrated.

Spider, aka Daddy Longlegs
A man of letters. A Platonic dreamer in a dream world. A masochist with an idealized ego that denies reality. An astute producer of guilt in others. Obsessively in love with Blatta. If he wishes you a happy Christmas, you should see the Mormon in him, sneaking to push his agenda. Beware of him though, for he is unbelievably persuasive! Hopeless doesn't know better when Spider invites him to Mother's Land.

Scorpion
The mirror-image and the object of Mr. Spider's homicidal/homoerotic pursuit. An alleged child killer. A rational and careless superego that must perish so that Spider could be relieved of agony. Blatta's current lover. Though the tension in the first issue is between his alleged infanticidal nature and his congruent position in the love triangle, a deeper story will be unfolded later in parallel with Hopeless' psyche.

Louse
One of the bouncers in the club Blatta works at. Just there for fun. Oh, and he accidentally exposes one of Mr. Four Legs' powers: The power of not only increasing in number, but also growing in size on a gigantic scale.

Blatta
The subject of Spider's unrequited love, his ex-lover. A burlesque performer. An elusive yet authoritative figure. Liberated from all kinds of trauma, she has grown immune to Spider's persuasive and guilt-generating skills. Contains men and fixes them painfully, which might be why Hopeless feels uncomfortable with her.

WHY INDIEGOGO?
Production and shipping costs are a major concern for us, especially because our work appeals to international readers and we do not have any financial support or a sponsor. Indiegogo is a great place to accomplish the projects of the like. If we reach our goal, we offer to share with you a limited edition of the first two episodes of our project which is now complete. Since mass production is not yet an option for us, a limited addition will allow for a high quality work with the cost as minimal as possible. We also kept these factors in mind while carefully selecting rewards.
WHAT YOU WILL RECEIVE

Paperback edition, poster and fan art: Our initial and biggest goal is to deliver the first two episodes of our story in high quality paperback form. We have had to limit the first edition to only 250 copies in order to fulfill this goal with a realistic budget: We ensure you will have added a painstakingly created product to your collection. Not only will you receive the 88 page colored book and 20"" x 27"" sized coated glossy paper posters including the characters of the first issue, but also fan artworks added to the book (5 additional pages and possibly more). The one you see above was made by Şerif Karasu and you will get the artwork of two more artists in print. We are in the process of creating our characters for the second issue, and you can also get posters including them if you would like to take a peek into what is to come.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign
