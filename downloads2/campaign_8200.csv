Knit the Bridge (KtB) doesn't aim simply to transform public space. We want to transform the way our communities work, play, and interact with each other. Knit the Bridge reaches deep into diverse neighborhoods and brings people together in new ways to knit, crochet, design, install, and collaborate. Over the past year, we've organized hundreds of local events and knit-ins. When drivers, bikers, boaters, and pedestrians admire the bridge's fabulous new look, we want them o see the full range of ages, ethnicities, gender identities, abilities, and economic groups that comprise our vibrant corner of the rustbelt.  
 
What it takes
Knit the Bridge is a labor of love and commitment that started with the Fiberarts Guild of Pittsburgh, a local nonprofit organization committed to the creative development, appreciation, and preservation of the fiber arts.  Local funders and arts organizations jumped on the bandwagon to help us buy materials and reach out to various communities.  Boosted by so many supporters, volunteers, community leaders, and amazing knitters... we are in the home stretch of a landmark project that can light up the Pittsburgh region and serve as a model for other cities.  But we need help to go the distance.  We are hoping to raise $35,000 to pay installation costs, ensure public safety, and reuse the materials. 
 
 
 
In case you’re wondering...
What happens to all that knitting once the project comes down?  Most of the bridge panels will be thoroughly laundered, repaired, and donated to neighborhood shelters. Some pieces will be given as thank you perks to indiegogo donors. Check out our perks listed on the sidebar and on our blog: http://knitthebridge.wordpress.com/indiegogo/

 
How you can help
At Knit the Bridge every person counts, every stitch gets us closer to our end goal. There are many ways to participate including donating funds, spreading the word, and signing up on our website to help assemble, prep, and install for the bridge.

Made programming free for participants.2. Will provide free transit cards to be used to and from program.3. Will provide 1 meal per day, prepared and shared by instructors and students.Your donations are going towards funding our Pilot Summer Session, which will impact the lives of 12 girls this June 16th through July 26th.  That is programming for 6 weeks, 4 days a week, 4 hours a day. At the end of program there will be 3 performances for you to catch!  All content will be written and performed by the {she crew} participants!The $13,000 goes to:{she crew} rental space CivicLab!  Without this space, we cannot have a program.Food. We provide one free meal a day to participants.Transit Cards. Without transit cards, we cannot ensure that our participants can make it to and from program each day.Class Materials. There are a lot of materials that go into making a successful arts program. Think pens, journals, art supplies, yoga mats, etc. Administrative Costs. We have an incredible team working to make {she crew} happen. The crew members are working around the clock to ensure this groundbreaking and one-of-a-kind program can exist. Our Very Talented Videographer.  He made the video above, yay!  He will also catch moments throughout program, so we may have first rate marketing materials, as well as state-of-the-art assessments to better the future of {she crew}!and Instructors!  But most importantly... There are a lot of people giving their time, skill, and love to make {she crew} happen, and working at a massive discount because they believe in the cause. It is not news that being an adolescent girl is difficult. We've all been there or know someone who has been there. Everyone involved in {she crew} is working for little or nothing to ensure that these 12 girls receive support, community, artistic outlets, and a boost in confidence, in this incredibly formative age that will impact them for years to come.  The power of one girl is incredible, but the power of two, or three, or twelve is infinite! Our students are at a formative age, when girls begin to identify with particular cliques and trends, and create a long lasting idea of who they are.  Carol Gilligan, a revolutionist in the academic world of psychology and gender studies, described this age in girls as: a ""watershed in female development, a time when girls are in danger of drowning or disappearing"".  {she crew}'s empowerment message is meant to be preventative; to give girls tools, artistic outlets, and a grounding sense of self, to help them through their later teen years.  When you give one girl the tools to be confident and speak her mind, she inspires others to do the same.  Other ways to contribute:{1.} Come to our physical fundraiser!"" {she crew}'s Sadie Hawkins Dance!""Where: La Bruquena in Humboldt Park, Chicago, IL.When: April 11th at 9pm.{She's inviting you!}{2.} In Kind Donations!  Have more pens than you know what to do with?  Want to give enough yoga mats for each girl to have one during program?

The purpose of the project is to promote tourism and culture in Livorno by combining the basic principles of ecology and Art. Specifically, the installation provides for the exploitation of public areas that need to be upgraded, the possibility of interaction and the necessary accessibility for its use, with zero environmental impact and all this at a very low cost as the result of a free collaboration between citizens and experts. Will be considered the possibility of involving young students in training activity designed to raise awareness of the musical culture, education and listening in the broadest sense, a self-awareness that contributes to the formation of the individual's harmony.

<h2><em>The IMPACT<br/></em></h2>
<p><strong>Life Is Sweet will be the first ever picture book in English about the Ishigaki Island sugarcane harvest.</strong> That means the book will be a great asset in preserving the traditional and current histories being written as farmers plow their fields and the big factory or small local presses process their cane. My shared experience will provide a deeper understanding of the various aspects of the region-specific work that rough and weathered farmers must do each year to satisfy the national sweet tooth. I worked the fields myself blistered, bug-bitten, sunburnt, busted and bruised in order to accurately offer this special in-depth look at an annual way of life for many - a means to survive on beautiful, yet typhoon-ridden, windswept island gems like Ishigaki.</p>
<p><img alt=""Teamwork"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://jmuzacz.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/teamwork.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Teamwork""/></p>
<p><strong>Meeting a local farmer with generations of experience</strong> and a wealth of knowledge about all aspects of growing and harvesting satou-kibi sugarcane, I was very lucky as a foreigner to be taken under wing, trained and gain first hand experience from the start. I feel obliged thus to recreate through colorful images bound with an insightful story what I have seen, felt and learned in a FUN way.</p>
<p><strong>This local history is completely unique to the Yaeyama Islands of Ryukyu Okinawa, though many underlying themes and struggles on this small island represent much greater universal issues.</strong> For instance, that of modern farmers worldwide balancing environmental costs and benefits associated with growing crops we all love and can't get enough of, the importance of cultivating teamwork and healthy community, respecting tradition while increasingly utilizing new technologies to maximize efficiency, AND that unmatched contentment you feel after completing a long, hard day's work.</p>

The People have spoken, Option #1 Cover design ""The Field"" it is!
  
If you have a sweet tooth and/or want to live to be 100...Get the book and some black sugar! You've never tasted healthy sugar this good. A one-way ticket for your senses straight to a little known island of southern Okinawa. Perfect reading for the kids, too. Don't have kids? Give the book to a friend who does! I need your contribution now to publish this work properly in August.
""It is interesting that Okinawa is famous for enjoying the greatest longevity among the entire Japanese population, and the Japanese themselves have the longest life span in the world. The consumption of pure Kokuto black sugar along with plenty seaweed, tofu and pork (yes, pork!) is believed to contribute to the healthy long life of Okinawans.""

<p>Yebo! ArtReach is a nonprofit organisation in the Kingdom of Swaziland. Founded in 2011 as an extension of <strong>Yebo! Art Gallery</strong>, we work together with local artists in running arts-related outreach projects and workshops. In 2012, ArtReach was registered as a separate NGO, primarily to address the lack of arts awareness and creative education in Swaziland.</p>
<p><strong>Vision:</strong> A vibrant, creative and artistic Swaziland where the arts are both promoted as a necessary and relevant industry, and practiced as a unique tool for personal and social development </p>
<p> <strong>Mission:</strong> To promote the arts, innovative skills-training and creative freedom of expression in Swaziland through various grassroots initiatives and development work </p>
<p> Please visit <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.yeboswaziland.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.yeboswaziland.com</a></span> to find out more about us.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need!</strong></h2>
<p>ArtReach is on the move! We have already accomplished a great deal in the 9 months that we have been operating. With enormous potential and an overwhelming response to our work, we are looking to expand our vision and capabilities into the new year.</p>
<p>  In order to do this we need your help! We are looking to raise at least <strong>$6500</strong> (approx. SZL 53,000) to begin our work in 2013. This amount is a starting point and will not cover our operations for the whole year, so any funds raised on top of this amount will definitely go a long way in reaching our goals!</p>
<p> ArtReach is currently working on a long-term project to begin intensive training programs with local artists and teachers. In the meantime, we are also looking to expand our continued outreach work in and around Swaziland. This is where you come in!</p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign has two important aims:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fundraising for the <em>Art Goes Public</em> project</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Fundraising for School and Youth Centre Outreach work</strong><strong><br/></strong>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/>1. Art Goes Public – Promoting the arts in Swaziland: Transforming Spaces &amp; Empowering Voices</span></strong></p>
<p>ArtReach has developed a new project called <em>Art Goes Public</em> to address the strong need for engaging with the arts amongst the Swazi public as a whole. This dual-focused project will work towards bringing visual arts and spoken word poetry into the public sphere of Swaziland. ‘Art Goes Public’ will work with established local artists and poets to facilitate public mural/mosaic projects, and poetry workshops and performances. This project aims to use visual arts and spoken word in collaboration to create a platform for creative expression regarding relevant and contemporary artistic and social issues in Swaziland.</p>
<p>The project will be facilitated by ArtReach in collaboration with local organisations <strong>Yebo! Art Gallery</strong> and <strong>Rooted Soulz Poetry Collective</strong>. It will run for a pre-determined number of days each month between March-August 2013 in various locations around Swaziland. Please read the full <strong><em>Art Goes Public</em> proposal for more info</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A minimum of $3000 is needed to begin this project. This will go towards the initial costs of: purchasing necessary materials, hosting artist’s planning meetings, paying artists, printing promotional arts materials and covering transport. Proper funding will then be sought to extend the project further into 2013.</strong></p>

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><br/>2. ArtReach – Using the arts as a tool for personal development through selected outreach projects</span></strong></p>
<p>ArtReach aims to continue our art classes and creative skills workshops with teachers and students around Swaziland. Some of the places we will be visiting in 2013 are: The High School for the Deaf, Cheshire Homes for Disabled People, Juvenile Detention Centre, Women’s Correctional Services, and selected youth centres around the country.</p>
<p> We need to further our capacity to run the workshops and projects in these places - largely by acquiring art, craft and stationary supplies, as most of our recipients cannot afford to purchase their own. ArtReach needs more tools and equipment in order to run these projects and workshops, but we would also like to be able to leave the participants with materials in order to continue working after the projects. Additionally, we will use funds to pay our artists and volunteers for their assistance in support in planning and conducting workshops. Though these workshops will focus primarily on visual arts, we will also be incorporating spoken word poetry, clowning, theatre and dance where possible.</p>
<p><strong>A minimum of $3000 is needed. This will go towards: purchasing necessary materials, paying artists and volunteers for their time, and covering transport costs. <br/><br/></strong></p>

<h2><strong><br/>Background Information</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>The Kingdom of Swaziland</strong></h3>
<h3><img alt=""Swaziland flag"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://unimaps.com/flags-africa/swazi-flag.gif"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Swaziland flag""/></h3>
<p>Swaziland is an amazing country with immense potential. It is, however, facing serious social, economic and political crises. Some of the issues currently facing Swaziland include youth unemployment of 53%, the breakdown of the traditional family unit, extreme HIV/AIDs statistics, financial crises, lack of proper education and resources, and growing social unrest. Over half of the population of Swaziland is now under the age of 18, and nearly a quarter are classified as ‘Orphaned and Vulnerable Children’ (OVC). For a tiny country with a small, homogonous population, these are all issues that will undoubtedly have dire consequences in the very near future.</p>
<p>These statistics may suggest rather bleak prospects for the average youth of Swaziland, but there are a number of positive initiatives addressing the various needs of the country. So how else can we begin to work towards strengthening the future of Swaziland? How can we help Swaziland realise it's full potential?</p>
<p>Whilst it is extremely important to address fundamental needs such as healthcare and access to food and water, it is also necessary to provide access to activities and people that stimulate innovative or creative thinking. This needs to be done in order to promote a stronger sense of individual or collective empowerment and awareness. It is extremely necessary to provide a platform through which Swazi youth (and adults) can express themselves freely in order to begin engaging in both internal and external dialogue. One of the best ways of doing this is through the arts – a sector that has, unfortunately, largely been neglected in Swaziland.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why Art?</strong></h3>
<p><img alt=""Artreach wall  painting"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://yeboswaziland.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/ArtReach-arters-6.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;"" title=""Artreach wall  painting""/>Swaziland has the capacity and potential to be a vibrant, dynamic and creative country. In order to get to this level, we need to begin thinking about alternative solutions.</p>
<p>Development is multi-faceted– when talking about personal or social development, we need to think more holistically, and begin thinking of ways in which we can empower the voices and spirits of a people, rather than just providing them with the bare essentials for survival. In order to do this, we need to begin building sustainable platforms for creativity and expression, as well as expose the general public to the arts in as many ways as possible.</p>
<p>What Swaziland needs is a conducive atmosphere for people to openly express themselves, and one that fosters creative thought processes. One of the best ways of achieving this is through sustained exposure to and involvement with the arts – an unparalleled means for developing strength, resiliency, and self-image that allows people to participate in society in a healthy way.  In the last decades, a significant body of research and practice has emerged, demonstrating that sustained involvement in the arts provides significant benefits, particularly for the youth. Harnessing creativity sparks a process of imagination and belief, encouraging creative thinking and problem solving: important traits that are then applied to all facets of one’s life – work, relationships, family, school, etc.</p>
<p>Art provides a holistic, “bigger picture” interpretation of life, and may be seen as embodying the end goal of any human development initiative: the cultivation of mental and physical health, worth and expression. For this reason, it is important to address promotion of the arts and creative thought and expression for all people in this country, bringing these to as wide an audience as possible.</p>

<p align=""center""> </p></div>","Yebo! ArtReach is a nonprofit organisation in the Kingdom of Swaziland. Founded in 2011 as an extension of Yebo! Art Gallery, we work together with local artists in running arts-related outreach projects and workshops. In 2012, ArtReach was registered as a separate NGO, primarily to address the lack of arts awareness and creative education in Swaziland.
Vision: A vibrant, creative and artistic Swaziland where the arts are both promoted as a necessary and relevant industry, and practiced as a unique tool for personal and social development 
 Mission: To promote the arts, innovative skills-training and creative freedom of expression in Swaziland through various grassroots initiatives and development work 
 Please visit www.yeboswaziland.com to find out more about us.
 
What We Need!
ArtReach is on the move! We have already accomplished a great deal in the 9 months that we have been operating. With enormous potential and an overwhelming response to our work, we are looking to expand our vision and capabilities into the new year.
  In order to do this we need your help! We are looking to raise at least $6500 (approx. SZL 53,000) to begin our work in 2013. This amount is a starting point and will not cover our operations for the whole year, so any funds raised on top of this amount will definitely go a long way in reaching our goals!
 ArtReach is currently working on a long-term project to begin intensive training programs with local artists and teachers. In the meantime, we are also looking to expand our continued outreach work in and around Swaziland. This is where you come in!
This Indiegogo campaign has two important aims:

Fundraising for the Art Goes Public project

Fundraising for School and Youth Centre Outreach work


1. Art Goes Public – Promoting the arts in Swaziland: Transforming Spaces & Empowering Voices
ArtReach has developed a new project called Art Goes Public to address the strong need for engaging with the arts amongst the Swazi public as a whole. This dual-focused project will work towards bringing visual arts and spoken word poetry into the public sphere of Swaziland. ‘Art Goes Public’ will work with established local artists and poets to facilitate public mural/mosaic projects, and poetry workshops and performances. This project aims to use visual arts and spoken word in collaboration to create a platform for creative expression regarding relevant and contemporary artistic and social issues in Swaziland.
The project will be facilitated by ArtReach in collaboration with local organisations Yebo! Art Gallery and Rooted Soulz Poetry Collective. It will run for a pre-determined number of days each month between March-August 2013 in various locations around Swaziland. Please read the full Art Goes Public proposal for more info.
A minimum of $3000 is needed to begin this project. This will go towards the initial costs of: purchasing necessary materials, hosting artist’s planning meetings, paying artists, printing promotional arts materials and covering transport. Proper funding will then be sought to extend the project further into 2013.
    
2. ArtReach – Using the arts as a tool for personal development through selected outreach projects
ArtReach aims to continue our art classes and creative skills workshops with teachers and students around Swaziland. Some of the places we will be visiting in 2013 are: The High School for the Deaf, Cheshire Homes for Disabled People, Juvenile Detention Centre, Women’s Correctional Services, and selected youth centres around the country.
 We need to further our capacity to run the workshops and projects in these places - largely by acquiring art, craft and stationary supplies, as most of our recipients cannot afford to purchase their own. ArtReach needs more tools and equipment in order to run these projects and workshops, but we would also like to be able to leave the participants with materials in order to continue working after the projects. Additionally, we will use funds to pay our artists and volunteers for their assistance in support in planning and conducting workshops. Though these workshops will focus primarily on visual arts, we will also be incorporating spoken word poetry, clowning, theatre and dance where possible.
A minimum of $3000 is needed. This will go towards: purchasing necessary materials, paying artists and volunteers for their time, and covering transport costs. 
     
Your Impact
Every Dollar/Euro/Pound/Rand goes a long way in Swaziland. By contributing to our fundraising campaign you are helping to develop ArtReach as an organisation, as well as ensuring that our work reaches as many individuals and groups as possible.
We are excited to keep you up to date with our growth and developments, and to welcome you as part of the ArtReach team! Please see our previous fundraising success on Indiegogo here and here, and we encourage you to explore more of our work on our website and Facebook page.
We are also offering a small selection of “perks” for all Indiegogo contributers!  These are items that we can offer to say thank you for your enthusiasm and support. Please see the full list of Perks on the right side of our page. . .
 
Background Information
The Kingdom of Swaziland

Swaziland is an amazing country with immense potential. It is, however, facing serious social, economic and political crises. Some of the issues currently facing Swaziland include youth unemployment of 53%, the breakdown of the traditional family unit, extreme HIV/AIDs statistics, financial crises, lack of proper education and resources, and growing social unrest. Over half of the population of Swaziland is now under the age of 18, and nearly a quarter are classified as ‘Orphaned and Vulnerable Children’ (OVC). For a tiny country with a small, homogonous population, these are all issues that will undoubtedly have dire consequences in the very near future.
These statistics may suggest rather bleak prospects for the average youth of Swaziland, but there are a number of positive initiatives addressing the various needs of the country. So how else can we begin to work towards strengthening the future of Swaziland? How can we help Swaziland realise it's full potential?
Whilst it is extremely important to address fundamental needs such as healthcare and access to food and water, it is also necessary to provide access to activities and people that stimulate innovative or creative thinking. This needs to be done in order to promote a stronger sense of individual or collective empowerment and awareness. It is extremely necessary to provide a platform through which Swazi youth (and adults) can express themselves freely in order to begin engaging in both internal and external dialogue. One of the best ways of doing this is through the arts – a sector that has, unfortunately, largely been neglected in Swaziland.
 
Why Art?
Swaziland has the capacity and potential to be a vibrant, dynamic and creative country. In order to get to this level, we need to begin thinking about alternative solutions.
Development is multi-faceted– when talking about personal or social development, we need to think more holistically, and begin thinking of ways in which we can empower the voices and spirits of a people, rather than just providing them with the bare essentials for survival. In order to do this, we need to begin building sustainable platforms for creativity and expression, as well as expose the general public to the arts in as many ways as possible.
What Swaziland needs is a conducive atmosphere for people to openly express themselves, and one that fosters creative thought processes. One of the best ways of achieving this is through sustained exposure to and involvement with the arts – an unparalleled means for developing strength, resiliency, and self-image that allows people to participate in society in a healthy way.  In the last decades, a significant body of research and practice has emerged, demonstrating that sustained involvement in the arts provides significant benefits, particularly for the youth. Harnessing creativity sparks a process of imagination and belief, encouraging creative thinking and problem solving: important traits that are then applied to all facets of one’s life – work, relationships, family, school, etc.
Art provides a holistic, “bigger picture” interpretation of life, and may be seen as embodying the end goal of any human development initiative: the cultivation of mental and physical health, worth and expression. For this reason, it is important to address promotion of the arts and creative thought and expression for all people in this country, bringing these to as wide an audience as possible.
  
How else can you help?
Other than trying to raise funds, any extra donations of time (volunteering, promoting, etc), materials (art and craft supplies) or resources (books, magazines, movies, etc) are greatly appreciated. 
Are you a manufacturer of art supplies? Do you have access to donated or second hand material? Are you part of a group or collective that could gather together to donate material? 
We are always looking for any of the following: Arts Materials (sketch pads, paints, pens, pencils, canvases, brushes, etc.), Crafts Materials (stationary, designs, etc), Books (classroom books, art reference books, magazines, etc) & relevant Computer Software programs or discs.
 
Thank You!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>New England has a great Art Scene, and Portland has a great Array of Galleries.<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: 'Trebuchet MS', Tahoma, Verdana; border-collapse: separate; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);""> </span> However most of these galleries are only looking to display commercial works. This leaves lots of the less conventional artists without an outlet.</p>
<p>The goal of this Art Show is to help get more of the local artists who can't get their work in galleries, or who at least never even thought they had a chance, out there and to get people to look at their work. To appreciate it despite or perhaps for its non conventional ways.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This show will help many New England artists gain exposure and present their work to people they couldn't reach without this event. It will also hopefully give the Portland audience an introduction to art and ideas they wouldn't normally be presented with. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $2000 will go towards securing a venue(Insurance fees, Permit fees if it's held on public property,Security deposits, and application fees if held on public property), helping to fund participating artists, paying the bands that come to play, advertising, and renting any necessary equipment(PA, Generator, Tents, Stage)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can tell all your friends, make us flyers. Show them to us and we'll probably print them up and put em around. Or just put them up yourself wherever you are. Or do both, whatever floats your boat. The more people that hear about it, the more funding we'll have, the more artists we can show, and the more people will come.</p>
<p>Also you can come to the show, you can have art in the show, you can run around waving your arms and screaming about the show. Just help us get people there.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If you do want to have art in the show and you're a New England Artist, or if you have any questions, send an E-Mail to EvanTGilbert@gmail.com.</p>

I really hope to get a lot more of these projects off the ground.I have many more ideas I would love to pursue with your help.But really, funding is just the very first way you can help,it would be amazing if you could share this page on yourTwitter, your Facebook, etc.ALSO, for more images and art just click the ""website"" link.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

After our out-all-night, glam-jam, party-party-party Opening Gala, 50 emerging artists across numerous disciplines will showcase their work in various unconventional site-specific— or “found”— spaces.

<h3>Who is 67 Sueños?</h3>
<p> <a href=""http://www.67suenos.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">67 Sueños</a> is a migrant youth collective born out of the need to raise our own voices and participate in legislative decisions that affect our future. </p>
<p>As a group, our objective is to strengthen the voices of underpriviledged migrant youth and broaden the legislative possibilities for immigration reform.</p>

<p>The goal of the 67 Sueños ""Health and Art with Migrant Womyn"" Campaign is to create a mural to be unveiled on August 26th, 2012 in the Fruitvale District of Oakland, California. The mural aims to bring light to the health challenges that migrant womyn face on a daily basis. It will highlight the 12 womyn's struggle to be heard and be healthy.</p>
<p>In our creative process for this mural we have interviewed womyn who have made the difficult choice of having to leave their own families and communities in search of a better life in the U.S. and in an effort to provide a better future to their children. We have interviewed young womyn who came to this country as children and are also struggling to remain healthy, to go to college, to secure a decent job and to become successful. In total we will interview 12 womyn young, adult and elderly and use these interviews to inform our mural vision. Professional artists and our youth will translate these stories into a large piece of public art that educates and encourages dialogue. The more we humanize the stories the more people will come to know that ""No Human is Illegal"".</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> What We Need:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> To achieve this mural we need $5,000 and over 50 volunteers. The money will be split between artist fees and youth stipends. All of the artists involved are local East Oakland Artists. We want this local mural to create paid opportunities for local artists and local migrant youth. We have already raised funds for materials and with your help are ready and willing to grace the Fruitvale community with a vibrant, beautiful and important mural.</p>

<p> This will be our second mural. Last summer 67 Sueños successfully painted a mural in San Francisco that portrayed what migrants leave behind when they come to the U.S. and what they encounter upon arrival.

<p><strong>The Impact </strong></p>
<p>Art is a  creative, non-violent and highly cultural and accessible form of communication. We believe in creating a culture united around a concern for change.   For that reason, today we want to bring art to the Fruitvale that exposes injustice and humanizes the womyn who live and struggle in this community. It is currently one of the most segregated and low-income communities in the Bay Area making this project transformative. Our Mural will be part of the cultural shift that engenders the statement, ""No Human Being is Illegal!""</p>

<p>Over the years, I've had many requests from fans that prints be made available to purchase of various paintings and other artwork.  Until now, two problems usually prevented me from pursuing these requests:  1.The venture required significant financial investment and risk, and/or 2. the end cost to the buyer would be too high to make it accessible to most fans.</p>
<p>Through financial backing from fans through indiegogo, I will be able to purchase my own giclée printer.  By producing the prints myself, I can print on demand, which in turn allows me to sell a wide variety of my artwork in a way that would both be profitable for me and at a very reasonable price for my fans.  In producing the prints myself, I can ensure that each print meets my high standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>The print quality is nearly identical to the original artwork.  </li>
<li>The sizing will match when possible (the majority of my artwork will reproduce at a 1:1 ratio).  </li>
<li>The paper and ink is archival quality.</li>
<li>All prints signed and numbered.</li>
<li>All prints will have a 1"" white border (approx).</li>
</ul><p>The initial print collection will include iconic and notorious paintings from Deadworld and Cannibal Corpse as well as some paintings and pen and ink drawings from my personal and art gallery works.</p>
<p><strong>BIO:</strong></p>
<p>Vince Locke: Artist and Illustrator<br/><br/> Vince Locke is an accomplished artist who began his art career in 1986 illustrating <em>Deadworld</em>, a zombie horror comic that soon became an underground hit. Since then, his illustrative talents in comics have included <em>The Sandman</em>, <em>American Freak</em>, <em>Batman</em>, <em>Witchcraft: Le Terreur</em>, <em>The Spectre</em>, <em>A History of Violence</em>, (which was later made into a movie directed by David Cronenberg and starring Viggo Mortensen), and most recently, <em>The Unwritten</em>. Locke has also gained notoriety by creating ultra-violent watercolor paintings used as album covers for the death metal band Cannibal Corpse, and by providing illustrations for the dark-fantasy author Caitlín R. Kiernan. His paintings have been featured in numerous galleries around the world.  He lives with his wife and three sons in Michigan, where he continues to draw and paint many things.</p>

Over the years, I've had many requests from fans that prints be made available to purchase of various paintings and other artwork.  Until now, two problems usually prevented me from pursuing these requests:  1.The venture required significant financial investment and risk, and/or 2. the end cost to the buyer would be too high to make it accessible to most fans.
Through financial backing from fans through indiegogo, I will be able to purchase my own giclée printer.  By producing the prints myself, I can print on demand, which in turn allows me to sell a wide variety of my artwork in a way that would both be profitable for me and at a very reasonable price for my fans.  In producing the prints myself, I can ensure that each print meets my high standards:

The print quality is nearly identical to the original artwork.  
The sizing will match when possible (the majority of my artwork will reproduce at a 1:1 ratio).  
The paper and ink is archival quality.
All prints signed and numbered.
All prints will have a 1"" white border (approx).
The initial print collection will include iconic and notorious paintings from Deadworld and Cannibal Corpse as well as some paintings and pen and ink drawings from my personal and art gallery works.
BIO:
Vince Locke: Artist and Illustrator Vince Locke is an accomplished artist who began his art career in 1986 illustrating Deadworld, a zombie horror comic that soon became an underground hit. Since then, his illustrative talents in comics have included The Sandman, American Freak, Batman, Witchcraft: Le Terreur, The Spectre, A History of Violence, (which was later made into a movie directed by David Cronenberg and starring Viggo Mortensen), and most recently, The Unwritten. Locke has also gained notoriety by creating ultra-violent watercolor paintings used as album covers for the death metal band Cannibal Corpse, and by providing illustrations for the dark-fantasy author Caitlín R. Kiernan. His paintings have been featured in numerous galleries around the world.  He lives with his wife and three sons in Michigan, where he continues to draw and paint many things.

Rumor has it, it might’ve been due to the onset of computer games, and/or to the unprecedented ease  of access to pictures of girls in various stages of undress …<br/>Miro put his drawing on hiatus until the  age of 17 when all that time he’d sunk into playing computer games finally paid off in an unexpected way. One day, he booted up Warcraft 3, and there he found his inspiration in Blizzard’s art team incredible artwork. There was no turning back. Going back to the pencil and ink, Miro spent countless night at improving and refining his skills, before finally deciding to make the jump to digital art.<br/><b> </b> All the hard work was not for naught: in 2006, he was hired as a concept and texture artist at the game developer Masthead Studios, where he spent the next 6 years giving freedom to his fantasy, and bringing fantastic creatures and landscapes to life. In 2012 Miro left the company to pursue  his own business and to branch out in more diverse creative directions.</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/524741/files/20140422032701-ThankYouFellows.jpg?1398162421"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p></div>","Between

The Creation of MiroSomewhere between socialism and something else, in the very begining of the upcoming long and cold winter of 1985, Miroslav was born, with a marvellous for the time almost 5 kilograms weight.Untill the age of 9, it was his teacher conviction that he was a natural born art prodigy.  Years passed, though, and he proved them all wrong by not evolving at all (one of his biggest regrets in retrospect) artistically. Rumor has it, it might’ve been due to the onset of computer games, and/or to the unprecedented ease  of access to pictures of girls in various stages of undress …Miro put his drawing on hiatus until the  age of 17 when all that time he’d sunk into playing computer games finally paid off in an unexpected way. One day, he booted up Warcraft 3, and there he found his inspiration in Blizzard’s art team incredible artwork. There was no turning back. Going back to the pencil and ink, Miro spent countless night at improving and refining his skills, before finally deciding to make the jump to digital art.  All the hard work was not for naught: in 2006, he was hired as a concept and texture artist at the game developer Masthead Studios, where he spent the next 6 years giving freedom to his fantasy, and bringing fantastic creatures and landscapes to life. In 2012 Miro left the company to pursue  his own business and to branch out in more diverse creative directions.",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

I’ve worked in film and games for the last 6 years, creating monsters and rich story lines for them and even got to get in front to the camera a couple of times. </span><p>Ever since I got my first gameboy as a child Ive been hooked on Pokemon.

Technology far advanced than our own and legends and a world that marvel against our own. With all of this and a collecting element to the game, they created something that would capture the hearts and minds of millions. However, as I’ve grown, Pokemon hasn’t grown with me. Its still aimed at a young audience, and rightly so, but what about their older fans? One day, I thought to myself, why isn't there an older form of Pokemon for a generation that grew up loving it, so thats where I came up with the idea, of ‘The World of Pokemon’.</p><div>

<p>My plan is to build a fully interactive site with huge amounts of artwork and detailed information on the Pokemon world.</p>
<p>'The World of Pokemon' is a non profit website that shows Pokemon in a realistic way.</p>

<p>Within a year of receiving the funding we will have a screening of the website to which only the 'Beta Testers' will all be allowed to see. We will have a message board open for one week where you can state your likes and dislikes about the site. We will then go away and fix any bugs and change anything that you guys didn't like. </p>
<p>The site will then launch to the general public with the first lot of content. This will probably include a large amount of Pokemon, a detailed look at Pallet and much much more.</p>
<p>Finally we will begin to give monthly updates with new and exciting things like new Pokemon, Gyms, Tech etc Also possible videos with presenters giving you all the latest news on everything Pokemon (if budget allows).</p>
<p>We will work on a region at a time, very much how you work your way through the games but including information from every source, up until the latest release. This means you will get content out faster and you will be constantly updated with new and exciting things!</p>
<p>Eventually I want to be able to invite artists and writers from all over the world to contribute and offer areas for fans to post fan art and fan fiction. I also have ideas in the far future to involve 3D artists from around the world to create a 'National Geographic' style web series, but this can only be done with backing and community support</p>

I’ve worked in film and games for the last 6 years, creating monsters and rich story lines for them and even got to get in front to the camera a couple of times. Ever since I got my first gameboy as a child Ive been hooked on Pokemon. It builds upon some of the fundamental elements of the imagination, blending science fiction and fantasy. A world filled with fantastical creatures with amazing abilities living alongside humans. Technology far advanced than our own and legends and a world that marvel against our own. With all of this and a collecting element to the game, they created something that would capture the hearts and minds of millions. However, as I’ve grown, Pokemon hasn’t grown with me.

One day, I thought to myself, why isn't there an older form of Pokemon for a generation that grew up loving it, so thats where I came up with the idea, of ‘The World of Pokemon’.
The Idea
My plan is to build a fully interactive site with huge amounts of artwork and detailed information on the Pokemon world.
'The World of Pokemon' is a non profit website that shows Pokemon in a realistic way.
The website includes:


Biology


Biological studies of the Pokemon. Types and how their abilities work, how evolving works, their habitats, diets, training techniques and much, much more!
The World


The World in which the Pokemon live in. Looking at the Cities, Towns, forests and wilds, each with detailed maps and histories surrounding them. Also looking at Gyms etc.



History
A long and detailed look at the History of their world such as lost civilisations, world wars and religion. Plus a look into the natural evolution of Pokemon.


Technology


The Technology of the their world and how it works, such as Pokeball's, Pokemon storage etc.



The Pokemon League

The League and the different tournaments it provides like Pokemon Battles, Beauty contests, Breeding contests etc.



Extras
The website will also be full of fun extras, such as online comics, fan fiction, areas for fans to talk and share their ideas (which will help shape the website) and possibly even mini games and videos! Other possible extras are:


Fully animated graphic transitions on the site such as buttons, page shifts and mini animations
A cinematic score created by Gabriel Ryfer Cohen and his team
Actual SFX of the Pokemon calls and roars.
3D models of each Pokemon created by our incredibly talented 3D design team. First as realistic pictures but hopefully we can develop and rig them into animated models.
The site could be translated into many other languages such as French, Italian, German and Japanese.
Bring on game designers to create free mini games. A few Ideas are - 'The Pokemon Academy' where you learn about Pokemon and solve tests and puzzles to find out what kind of Trainer you will be and a 'League simulator' where you manage a team (similar to football manager) through the league right up to the World championships. 
A full 'Pokemon Youtube Channel' that collaborates with many other Pokemon channels bringing you the latest news.


If you fund the project you will not only be kept up to date as it goes on, you will even get to help shape what we create. The more funding we receive, the more time we can spend on it as a team, making it as in depth as possible using all the resources at our disposal.Copyright?
We are a FAN SITE. The website wont charge its members a membership fee and will be purely funded by advertisements and donations.

What We Need!We want to create a full interactive fan site of a high quality, the money will go towards:

Paying a skilled web designer to create and maintain the site.

and Hosting

We have asked for quotes from a number of web designers and most have said (for the original size, scale and complexity that were after) - £15'000- £25'000.

The Plan

Within a year of receiving the funding we will have a screening of the website to which only the 'Beta Testers' will all be allowed to see. We will have a message board open for one week where you can state your likes and dislikes about the site. We will then go away and fix any bugs and change anything that you guys didn't like. 
The site will then launch to the general public with the first lot of content. This will probably include a large amount of Pokemon, a detailed look at Pallet and much much more.
Finally we will begin to give monthly updates with new and exciting things like new Pokemon, Gyms, Tech etc Also possible videos with presenters giving you all the latest news on everything Pokemon (if budget allows).
We will work on a region at a time, very much how you work your way through the games but including information from every source, up until the latest release. This means you will get content out faster and you will be constantly updated with new and exciting things!
Eventually I want to be able to invite artists and writers from all over the world to contribute and offer areas for fans to post fan art and fan fiction. I also have ideas in the far future to involve 3D artists from around the world to create a 'National Geographic' style web series, but this can only be done with backing and community support

I created the group on Facebook. I have learned what people want in a colouring book and what the frustrations are for seniors with the current styles of adult colouring books. A lot have eye sight and dexterity issues which make the intricate pages impossible for them to colour.</p>
<p>I need to get the group from facebook and into its own website where colouring books can be sold, the pages coloured can be displayed, events calendar for people to see the upcoming free events and a blog where i can be doing videos and writing about colouring tips!</p>
<p>I want to create a colouring book with multiple artists to provide a variety of images. I want lots of natural images with some intricate and some easy so that everyone can find a page to colour! I will have images for men and women, images from the decades they grew up in and music to go along with the books to make them smile.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Adult colouring books are big business and are therapeutic. Anyone can colour you do not need to have artistic talent and it can be done with dollar store pencils.  The New York Times Best Seller list has 5 of their top 10 books as adult colouring books.  By 2020 10% of the world population will be over 65. I want to bring a little childhood joy back to them and respect their likes and dislikes. I want to colour with alzheimer and dementia patients to see if i can get a smile from them with the music they love in the background!  I just want to bring a little joy into their lives!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I have been looking for the right opportunity for me to make a true difference in this world. I personally struggle with complex PTSD depression and anxiety so this is also therapeutic for me. I know that this will be healing for me and for the seniors i can bring joy too. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Even if you can't contribute do you know someone who is an artist who might want to contribute a picture for this book?</p>
<p>Do you know a group of seniors that would love to be interviewed about what they want in a colouring book?</p>
<p>Please share with the tools on this site and tell all your friends about my idea if its one you believe in!</p>

I want to bring a little childhood joy back to them and respect their likes and dislikes. I want to colour with alzheimer and dementia patients to see if i can get a smile from them with the music they love in the background!  I just want to bring a little joy into their lives!
    Risks & Challenges I have been looking for the right opportunity for me to make a true difference in this world. I personally struggle with complex PTSD depression and anxiety so this is also therapeutic for me. I know that this will be healing for me and for the seniors i can bring joy too. 
    Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't contribute do you know someone who is an artist who might want to contribute a picture for this book?
Do you know a group of seniors that would love to be interviewed about what they want in a colouring book?
Please share with the tools on this site and tell all your friends about my idea if its one you believe in!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Thanks to the local community the launch of <a href=""http://www.thekelseytheater.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Kelsey Theater</a> has been a growing success, and even given birth to what we now call <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/LakeParkArtsDistrict/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Lake Park Arts District</a>.

The answer is to utilize the only real estate we have left in a project that benefits local artists and the community alike.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481476474/o9toafgxdejogezafllq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Where others saw only a blank wall <a href=""http://www.singlehandedstudio.com/about.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A.J. Brockman</a> and company saw a blank canvas with seemingly endless opportunities. The plan is to turn the back side of the 700 block into a giant mural with contributions from multiple artists. Much like Miami's Wynwood we are taking an otherwise unremarkable alleyway and turning it into a cultural destination. We already have one section completed (you can learn More here : <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/leaving-our-mark-in-lake-park-a-mural-project-art-community/x/935803#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Phase 1</a>)</p>

<p>So why are we raising money? All of the artists involved are professionals, people who make their living from their art. Many times people get artists to do something like this in exchange for ""exposure"" and as artists ourselves we feel that is not always fair. They deserve compensation for their contribution. So the money raised will first purchase the materials needed and then every remaining cent will go to paying the artists for their work. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, we need to fill this wall with eye-popping color that will make The Lake Park Arts District visible from outer space! Okay, maybe that's a bit unrealistic, but we still want to beautify this town with public art. The extent to which the wall gets painted depends on how much money we raise. Here is a quick illustration for those visual learners. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494431105/v0xuyimzgm6dmu5l2gd3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>100% of all the funds raised will be going towards supplies, rental equipment, permitting and actually paying these artists because artwork is WORK. Once we reach our initial goal any additional money raised will be put into escrow and applied to the next round of muralists until we are able to paint the entire 700 building (pretty much a city block). After that, we start again right back at the beginning so there is always fresh imagery to inspire our community.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481483126/v7z6ztz7ww4b9igckcjx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are also partnering with local businesses, art stores, construction companies, and the suppliers themselves in order to minimize the amount of money we have to actually spend to make this wall happen. In turn, we are able to put more money into the artist pockets allowing them to continue to share their work and make a living.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481483151/ymabsojvevezf0vbwqhz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Art is something that was always a passion to me as a child and as an adult, more like my mistress. Art nights are no sleep nights. My best art is done during the late hours. I went to school for fine arts. Bak Middle School of the Arts was my base. As I got older, Dreyfoos School of the Arts helped me find myself as an artist. I tried college but found myself in the real world and had to work. Today I find myself tattooing and painting for a living and couldn't be happier. Tattooing at Ritual Ink has given me the pleasure to do art and live. Murals are something I have love for but I haven't had too many chances to show off publicly. I've aways done them in private homes. It's always nice to get a public recognition when it comes to big art. I live for the smile people get when they see art and are confused or intrigued.</p>

Where others saw only a blank wall A.J. Brockman and company saw a blank canvas with seemingly endless opportunities. The plan is to turn the back side of the 700 block into a giant mural with contributions from multiple artists. Much like Miami's Wynwood we are taking an otherwise unremarkable alleyway and turning it into a cultural destination. We already have one section completed (you can learn More here : Phase 1)

So why are we raising money? All of the artists involved are professionals, people who make their living from their art.

Five years passed and I received my Bachelors degree from Universidad Central del Ecuador (Central University of Ecuador), majoring in Sculpture. During that time I worked in the urban area, including abandoned buildings in various cities of Ecuador. Currently, I alternate between Florida, Mexico, and Ecuador. 

 
Jennifer Chaparro – She grew up in San Diego, but has lived in Florida since 1999. She has a degree in Design from UCLA. She began street painting in 2004 in Lake Worth, Florida, with her daughter, Mercedes, and then her other daughter, Carmen.  Her company, Amazing Street Painting, creates large scale art in many mediums, including chalk & paint, for companies like Starbucks, Lexus and Ford.  Jennifer has won many awards for her chalk art, and travels the world creating custom works of art for festivals and special events.  She received her Maestro Certification in 2011, and is known for her exquisite portraiture, but also for exciting 3D anamorphic street art that boggles the mind. Jennifer was the first US woman to win an award in the 3D category at the Street Art Festival in Wilhelmshaven, Germany.  She also recently won the CANVAS West Palm Beach Local Showdown for her mural work in 2016.

 
Jose Gaddi – I was born in Argentina and raised in the States. Art is something that was always a passion to me as a child and as an adult, more like my mistress. Art nights are no sleep nights. My best art is done during the late hours. I went to school for fine arts. Bak Middle School of the Arts was my base. As I got older, Dreyfoos School of the Arts helped me find myself as an artist. I tried college but found myself in the real world and had to work. Today I find myself tattooing and painting for a living and couldn't be happier. Tattooing at Ritual Ink has given me the pleasure to do art and live. Murals are something I have love for but I haven't had too many chances to show off publicly. I've aways done them in private homes. It's always nice to get a public recognition when it comes to big art. I live for the smile people get when they see art and are confused or intrigued.

 
Mayling Pao – born in Matagalpa, Nicaragua and raised in South Florida. She attended the prestigious high school, New World School of the Arts in Miami, FL and received her BFA from the Kansas City Art Institute in Kansas City, MO. Her fine art has been exhibited in galleries and art festivals in Miami, West Palm Beach, FL, and Kansas City, MO. Her art includes fine art paintings, portraits, murals, and paper maché sculpture. She is also a body painter and special effects makeup artist.

 
Sami Makela – (born 1972) is from Helsinki, Finland. As a son of a well-known World War II illustrator, Reijo Makela, Sami grew up appreciating all types of art. After finishing art school in Helsinki and making a name for himself as a graffiti mural artist, Sami traveled to Paris to seek inspiration. Finally in 1994, Sami decided to pursue his dreams in America. As an owner of Makela Art Studio, art restoration, murals and decorative painting is close to Sami’s heart. He has also continued to create his original paintings for clients. He has also been involved in street art events and work since the mid-1990s, and many of his murals are still in existence around Palm Beach County. In addition, one of his mural works “History of Helsinki” (1992) is part of a permanent exhibit in Helsinki Museum of Art.

 
Evgeniy Shurakov – Born and raised in Russia in 1981.  I drew a lot as most children do but at about age 11 I made a conscious choice to become an artist.  In 1996 my mother brought me here to South Florida.  Graduated Deerfield Beach High School in 2000.  In high school, I was a part of the Magnet program and I did illustration for the school's newspaper and other publications.  Between 2000-2003 apprenticed at an art studio under master artist doing murals, faux finish, hand painting among many other things.  Did a lot of work in the style of Trome l'oeil.  I went on to graduate Ringling College of Art and Design in 2007 with a BFA in Illustration and minoring in Fine Art.  From 2008-2013 moved to Russia and worked as a concept/2D artist at Playrix Entertainment (casual gaming industry).  Since 2013 I moved back to South Florida with my wife and kids and continue as a freelance artist doing murals, theater production, digital illustration among many other things.  

 

Risks & Challenges
With the success of one of the most-funded campaigns in Indiegogo history in the theater category, so let's just say this is not our first rodeo. We have built an awesome core team of organizers, have city and governmental support, own the building, pulled permits, have artists ready and waiting, not even mother nature can hold us back (we have plenty of rain ponchos for our artists and have even scheduled more than two weeks to create these murals before the big unveiling; even if we are dodging South Florida sun showers). The only thing missing is the money, coffee, and paint thinner to get this mural launched!

<p>Hi I'm Robert Hughes, a self taught artist.  I'm very excited that the Cafe Verde in Ann Arbor will host an art show with my art.  I have a number of pen and ink with watercolor pencil drawings, which are ready to show; however, I think that my best art is the digital images that I've created.</p>
<p>The contributions that you make here will fund the professional printing of some of these digital images I've designed.  Paragon Display, in Ann Arbor, is an excellent print shop.  For $500 they will take one of my digital images and blow it up to four feet by five and a half feet.  I'd love to see some of my images at that size in the Cafe!</p>
<p>However, it may be that I don't raise my goal of $2000.  If that is the case, I'll have to go for smaller sizes of these prints.  A framed ten inch by fourteen inch print costs $96 for the print shop to make.  That's a respectable size; and it would be great to have several of my images showcased that way.</p>

<p>If I only raise a very small amount of money, I'll put it into framing the pen and ink drawings that I have done and get them to the cafe.  These signed original artworks can be purchased as perks on this fundraising site.  They are done on 90 lb watercolor paper produced by Strathmore.  They have a cold pressed surface and are acid free.  The drawings, made about two years while I lived at the Zen Buddhist Temple, are holding up very well, and if kept from direct sunlight should be genuine heirloom pieces.</p>
<p>The drawings are easy to spot in the gallery section of this fundraiser.  They are the photos where you can see my hands holding the art at the top and bottom of the artwork.  The digital art images, from which I'll make the art cards (and larger sized posters) are also in the gallery section.  They are the flatter images with no hands holding the art.</p>
<p>The art cards (and 8 and a half by 11 inch posters) that I am offering here are made with longevity in mind.  They are made on 65 lb weight acid free card stock with a HP color laser printer.  Kept from direct sunlight, they will maintain their splendid colors for many, many years.</p>
<p>The artwork that I have made will amplify and enhance the ambiance of the Cafe Verde, where people of all ages converge.  Your generous contribution will increase the impact that the art has on the people visiting the store.</p>

<h3>Welcome To The Black Sabbath</h3>
<p>After several months of hard work, the Devilman Tarot Project team is pleased to announce that our finished deck, <strong>Tarot of the Black Sabbath</strong>, is finally available for preordering! All of our mods and contributors have put their hearts and souls into making this project a reality, and only a few of us had to merge with demons to make it possible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>A Terrible Fate Awaits You...</h3>
<p>...Or maybe a really great one! That's what these cards are for, after all. But while we can't change your future, we can guarantee at least <i>one</i> good thing will happen if your preorder!</p>
<p>The deck itself contains 78 cards, and comes inside its own tuck-box for convenient storage or display. It also comes with a small guide booklet containing all of the card meanings and artist credits!</p>
<p>We've provided a few different options for preordering, and so long as you donate $10 or more, you can get yourself some of our cool merch! Depending on what you select, this includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The full 78 card deck</li>
<li>A collaborative sticker sheet featuring several characters from the series</li>
<li>Button badges</li>
<li>Acrylic charms</li>
<li>Enamel pins</li>
<li>And postcards, featuring printed artwork</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally,<i> </i><strong>everyone</strong> who preorders will receive an exclusive glow-in-the-dark Tako charm, regardless of which perk they choose. The first 10 people who preorder either merch bundle will <i>also</i> receive a limited edition Devilman bunny charm! (Be sure to select the ""Limited Edition"" version when choosing your perk if you want to claim yours!)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Goals, Risks, &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In order to fully fund production of the deck and other merchandise, we're asking for a total of $6000. This may seem like a lot, but we want to be sure that we are able to deliver a quality product to all of our customers, and that all of our contributors are properly compensated.</p>
<p>The good news? If we reach even <i>half</i> of our total goal, everyone who preordered will still get their copy of the deck, plus their preorder bonus items!</p>
<p>The not-so-good news? Most of our items are unable to be produced until after certain funding goals are met, so if we don't hit our target, we may have to cut back on some of the merch included in the bundles, or downgrade more expensive items, such as changing the enamel pin to an acrylic one.</p>
<p>But we are optimistic, and will do what we can with whatever funding we receive!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Any amount you can contribute will be beneficial, but if you can't donate, then you can help spread the word by telling your friends or posting about us on Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, or whatever social media site you use!</p>

I really want to make sure this project is done well, and for that I need your help.</p><p>I envision the video being like a surreal concert. It will explore concepts such as mapping between senses—in this case between music and sexual stimulation—as well as the performer-audience relationship. I also hope the video will be strangely beautiful and moving, even if its basic premise is rather absurd.</p><p>To make sure these points come across, I plan to hire a professional theremin player and people who will make sure the video is filmed and recorded well.

<p>A faint sound echos down the unfamiliar corridors. Almost like the wind, calling. You obey.</p>
<p>Louder, yet still unplaceable. One moment like some great generator starting up, the next like an opera singer heard through the floorboards. And there is something else too. Faint mumblings. Definitely human. Part of you wants to turn back but you're so close now. Through that cracked door just up ahead. With infinite caution, you peer in.</p>
<p>At the center of the chamber stands a man silhouetted by a spotlight. The air reverberates with etherial sound. He stands almost motionless, arms outstretched over a mysterious wooden box with two antennas springing from its sides. Only his hands move, gently yet commandingly, as if tracing out some infinitely intricate design in the air. You cannot look away. As his motions become quicker, the sound grows deeper and more profound.</p>
<p>Just as the music reaches a crescendo, a groan echoes out. Your heart races. Who else is there? The man continues playing unfazed.</p>
<p>How had you not noticed them before? The three figures reclining around the edge of the room. But they have not seen you. They look only at him, enraptured. Bodies contorting with every change in the music, with every subtle hand motion. Faces expressing pure bliss. And, in this moment, you want nothing more than to join them...</p>

Każda z naszych kolekcji jest realizowana w ramach limitowanych edycji w celu zapewnienia wyjątkowości i unikatowości naszych kreacji.</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Kolory odgrywają niezwykle istotną rolę w naszym życiu codziennym. W ramach naszej pierwszej kolekcji, proponujemy odważne kombinacje barwne, do noszenia na codzień, pasujące do eleganckich i niezobowiązujących ubrań. Jedwabny szal jest czymś więcej niż zwykłym dodatkiem, jest niczym biżuteria, która natychmiast odmieni Twój strój.</span></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">JAKOŚĆ JEST NASZYM PRIORYTETEM</span></strong></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Rozwijając naszą pierwszą kolekcję, współpracowaliśmy z doskonałymi rzemieślnikami, specjalizującymi się w druku na jedwabiu i wykończeniach tego cennego materiału, z dbałością o każdy szczegół. Naszą misją było stworzenie kobiecych, eleganckich i nowoczesnych dodatków o najwyższej jakości. </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">W tym celu, zrealizowaliśmy prototypy w 3 różnych krajach, porównując jakość i wierność kolorów. Przetestowaliśmy różne rodzaje jedwabiu i wybraliśmy jedwab typu Twill ze względu na jego bogatą teksturę, pięknie układające się fałdy i delikatny połysk. Twill nie gniecie się tak łatwo jak satyna jedwabna, co zapewnia mu nienaganny wygląd nawet po całodniowym noszeniu.</span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605760220/hsj636vm8p0xwwkm6lmm.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">EUROPEJSKIE TRADYCJE &amp; SAVOIR-FAIRE</span></strong></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Nasze szale są wykonywane na północy Włoch, w regionie Como.

Each of our collections is limited to a small number of pieces in order to guarantee the exclusivity and uniqueness of our creations. Colours play a vital role in our everyday life. In this first collection, we tried to play with bold combinations, providing you with a daily touch of colour, matching with elegant and casual cloths. More than a simple accessory, a silk scarf is like a jewel instantly transforming your outfit. QUALITY IS OUR PRIORITYTo develop our first collection, we were working with crasftsmen of excellence, from pattern making to silk printing and finishing, with care for every detail. Our mission was to create feminine, elegant and modern pieces of high quality and  high artistic value. We realised prototypes in 3 different countries, comparing the quality and colour rendering. We tested different types of silk to identify the combination of characteristics matching our philosophy of luxury scarf for daily use. We chose silk twill, because of its rich texture with fluid drape and delicate sparkle. Twill tends to keep its shape, compared to silk satin, easily wrinkled. EUROPEAN TRADITIONS & SAVOIR-FAIREOur scarves are crafted in the north of Italy, region of Como. It has ideal conditions to produce silk, due to its abundance of mulberry trees and crystal clear waters.  For more than 500 years, silk manufacturing in Como has been a worldwide symbol of quality, prestige and refinement.100 % OF COLOURS INSPIRED BY NATUREFor our first collection, we selected three leading colours, directly inspired by nature:
turmeric ORANGE expressing joy and happiness
carmin RED bringing dynamic forces and energy
verdian GREEN often linked to good balance and self-confidence.
The combinations of colours are eye-catching and harmonious, flattering and adding a special glow to the face. BOTANICAL INSPIRATIONSFor each pattern, Weronika (expert in botanical art) painted a rich ""vocabulary"" of floral shapes, carefully observing their anatomy.

Chacune de nos collections est limitée à un petit nombre d’exemplaires afin de garantir la qualité et l’originalité de nos créations.Les couleurs jouent un rôle vitale au quotidien. Dans cette première collection, nous avons essayé de jouer avec des combinaisons ambitieuses, apportant une touche de couleur compatible aussi bien avec des tenues élégantes qu’avec des ensembles décontractés. Plus qu’un simple accessoire, un foulard en soie peut, tel un bijou, transformer joliment une silhouette.LA QUALITÉ EST NOTRE PRIORITÉPour développer notre première collection, nous avons travaillé avec des artisans d’excellence, de la création du motif, à l’impression de la soie jusqu’aux dernières finitions. Tout cela avec le plus grand souci du détails. Notre mission fut de créer des pièces féminines, élégantes et modernes de grande qualité dont la valeur artistique est préservée. Nous avons réalisé des prototypes dans 3 pays différents, comparant la qualité et le rendu des couleurs. Nous avons testé différent type de soie pour identifier la matière la plus en phase abbé notre idée de foulard haut de gamme pour un usage au quotidien.Nous avons choisi le twill de soie grâce à sa texture riche, fluide et sans brillance délicate. Le twill garde sa forme à comparer au satin qui se froisse facilement.LES TRADITIONS & LE SAVOIR-FAIRE EUROPÉENSNos foulards sont fabriqué dans le nord de l’Italie dans la région de Côme. Nous avons fait ce choix car cette région dispose des conditions idéales pour produire la soie grâce à l’abondance des arbres de Mulberry et la qualité de ses eaux pures. Pendant plus de 500 ans, la production de soie de Côme dispose d’une réputation de qualité, de prestige et de raffinement.  100 % DES COULEURS INSPIRÉS PAR LA NATUREPour notre première collection, nous avons sélectionné 3 couleurs principales, directement inspirées par la nature:
ORANGE turmeric exprimant la joie et le bonheur

Ces combinaisons de couleurs attirent le regard tout en étant délicate et embellissent le visage en y reflétant un trait de couleurs souvent bénéfiques pour le teint.INSPIRATIONS BOTANIQUESPour chaque motif, Weronika (expert en art botanique) a peint un « vocabulaire » de silhouette florale, en observant méticuleusement leur anatomie.

Łączymy w niej ręcznie malowane projekty ze szlachetnym jedwabiem, oferując luksusowe szale o wysokim walorze artystycznym. Każda z naszych kolekcji jest realizowana w ramach limitowanych edycji w celu zapewnienia wyjątkowości i unikatowości naszych kreacji.Kolory odgrywają niezwykle istotną rolę w naszym życiu codziennym. W ramach naszej pierwszej kolekcji, proponujemy odważne kombinacje barwne, do noszenia na codzień, pasujące do eleganckich i niezobowiązujących ubrań. Jedwabny szal jest czymś więcej niż zwykłym dodatkiem, jest niczym biżuteria, która natychmiast odmieni Twój strój.JAKOŚĆ JEST NASZYM PRIORYTETEMRozwijając naszą pierwszą kolekcję, współpracowaliśmy z doskonałymi rzemieślnikami, specjalizującymi się w druku na jedwabiu i wykończeniach tego cennego materiału, z dbałością o każdy szczegół. Naszą misją było stworzenie kobiecych, eleganckich i nowoczesnych dodatków o najwyższej jakości. W tym celu, zrealizowaliśmy prototypy w 3 różnych krajach, porównując jakość i wierność kolorów. Przetestowaliśmy różne rodzaje jedwabiu i wybraliśmy jedwab typu Twill ze względu na jego bogatą teksturę, pięknie układające się fałdy i delikatny połysk. Twill nie gniecie się tak łatwo jak satyna jedwabna, co zapewnia mu nienaganny wygląd nawet po całodniowym noszeniu.EUROPEJSKIE TRADYCJE & SAVOIR-FAIRENasze szale są wykonywane na północy Włoch, w regionie Como. Ze względu na bogactwo drzew morwowych i krystalicznie czystą wodę, region ten posiada idealne warunki do produkcji jedwabiu. Od ponad 500 lat jedwabne tkaniny z Como są światowym symbolem jakości, prestiżu i wyrafinowania.100 % KOLORÓW INSPIROWANYCH NATURĄW ramach naszej pierwszej kolekcji wybraliśmy trzy główne kolory, bezpośrednio zainspirowane naturą:
pomarańcz kurkumy ""turmeric ORANGE"" wyrażająca radość i szczęcie
czerwień karminową ""carmin RED"" dająca witalność i energię
szmaragdowa zieleń ""verdian GREEN"" często kojarzona z dobrą równowagą pewnością siebie.
Harmonijne kompozycje kolorystyczne przyciągają wzrok, a barwy barwy delikatnie rozświetlone przez jedwabną tkaninę dodają twarzy szczególnego blasku i korzystnego wyglądu. BOTANICZNE INSPIRACJEDla każdego ze wzorów Weronika (specjalizująca się w sztuce botanicznej) namalowała bogate ""abecadło"" form kwiatowych, splecionych w organicznych kompozycjach. Podobnie jak w naturze, tak i na naszych chustach, każdy element jest unikatowy i nie występują powtórzenia.LIMITOWANA EDYCJA Oczekując na otwarcie naszego sklepu online, możecie wciąż  zamówić nasze jedwabne chusty poprzez tą platformę i skorzystać z korzystniejszych cen. INDIEGOGO SPECIAL: 130 € (cena rynkowa: 175 €)INDIEGOGO SPECIAL: 130 € (cena rynkowa: 175 €)INDIEGOGO SPECIAL: 130 € (cena rynkowa: 175 €) NOWE WZORY WKRÓTCEDziś posiadamy dwa nowe projekty, przetestowane i gotowe do wprowadzenia, oraz pracujemy nad nowymi wzorami.

Welcome to the campaign to Get Drawn As a Cartoon Character For Dirt Cheap!  WHY I'M RAISING FUNDS: Hello, my name is Zoran Nova Corban. I am the writer, artist and cartoonist for the animation ""Angels of Accolade"" Because of the Virus I am no longer making enough money with Lyft and I am struggling with my bills. The best way for me to raise money at this time is to offer art with an offer ""you can't refuse""! If I can raise enough in funding, I want to also build my Facebook page which currently has 1k followers. my goal is to build 10k followers so that I can successfully create a 20 minute cartoon for my story ""Angels of Accolade"". I want to make it into DVDs and hopefully one day have my animation featured on Adult Swim or Netflix.  I drive for Lyft to raise funds to make my dreams a reality, but the Virus became an issue and I am not making enough money anymore to accomplish my goals. It got so bad that I am not even making enough money to pay my rent! I brainstormed Ideas to try and raise money to pay for rent and build my Facebook community... I decided to start a crowdfund! I understand that no one is making any money at this time and to afford artwork is not possible... so I decided to make my artwork DIRT CHEAP!!! Not only will I make my artwork cheap, I will also make it HIGH QUALITY... So take advantage of this amazing offer!    MY GOAL:Since the beginning of this year, I decided to make my dreams a reality to create my very own cartoon. I saved up for months to afford the expensive equipment required to make this cartoon happen... The next step was to build my Facebook page to bring awareness to my animation ""Angels of Accolade"". At first I was doing well and pulled off 1k followers who loves my artwork and story. I had a goal to reach 10k followers, but then the virus happened and my Lyft job suffered heavy because of it.  I knew I had to come up with another way to raise funds to achieve my dreams... And that's why I decided to create this campaign!      THE PERKS   GET DRAW IN BLACK AND WHITE    You or your loved one will be drawn, no color. You can also be drawn with wings or horns.     GET DRAWN IN FULL COLOR $45 OFF     You or your loved one will be drawn in full color. You can also be an angel or demon.

<p><span>The Clay Case meets both of those
needs - providing mobile programming and deepening the classroom experience.  Curriculum can be integrated into a
Clay Case to make them useful for teachers and really impactful for

Plus it’s a handy, fun tool that kids can take home, to extend that
learning with their families!</span></p>

<p>If we succeed in
raising the funds for this campaign, we'd be able to provide more programs in
schools,<span> at low cost or no-charge to the
school or students.  This is critical to
serve youth from low-income families. It would also allow us to increase the
number of schools that we work with and increase the number of students that
get to work with clay and own their own Clay Case.  </span></p>
<p><span>With this success, UP will
continue to foster interaction and creative community building within the
greater community, just as we do every day within our building.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our vision for the Clay Case is to continue bringing our studio – and authentic ceramic experiences - into families’ homes and schools all over Pittsburgh.</p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We need to raise $5,000 to buy all the supplies that go into the Clay Case, print more Clay Case boxes and work mats, cover the cost of firing finished artwork in our kiln, and send ceramic artists into schools to teach lessons with the Clay Cases.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If we don’t quite
reach our goal, <span>we won't be able to make
as many Clay Cases, we may not be able to give them to schools for free, and we
won't be able to send them in with a ceramic artist - a critical link in integrating
clay into existing curriculum. In
order to fully provide an authentic clay learning experience to children, we
need to raise the full $5,000.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our
unique perks include one-of-a-kind, handmade artwork from artists on staff and in
our community.  We’ve worked with them to
create drawings of our stained glass windows, images of Union Project, a
special edition ceramic mug, and a slate of high-end ceramic art!</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>By supporting this project you will help take ceramics programming out of our studio and put it directly into students' hands in classrooms.</p>
<p>When students learn how to create with clay, they
get excited and take more ownership and care in their work. They are proud to
share their learning with their friends and families.</p>

We need to raise $5,000 to buy all the supplies that go into the Clay Case, print more Clay Case boxes and work mats, cover the cost of firing finished artwork in our kiln, and send ceramic artists into schools to teach lessons with the Clay Cases.

If we don’t quite
reach our goal, we won't be able to make
as many Clay Cases, we may not be able to give them to schools for free, and we
won't be able to send them in with a ceramic artist - a critical link in integrating
clay into existing curriculum. In
order to fully provide an authentic clay learning experience to children, we
need to raise the full $5,000.

Our
unique perks include one-of-a-kind, handmade artwork from artists on staff and in
our community.  We’ve worked with them to
create drawings of our stained glass windows, images of Union Project, a
special edition ceramic mug, and a slate of high-end ceramic art!
   The Impact 
By supporting this project you will help take ceramics programming out of our studio and put it directly into students' hands in classrooms.
When students learn how to create with clay, they
get excited and take more ownership and care in their work. They are proud to
share their learning with their friends and families.
Donate today and help ensure that arts education through the Clay Case is available for all our communities’ children.  
    
    Other Ways You Can Help Once you've made your donation, please help us spread the word and share our campaign with your friends and family!

Our studio is a 30-foot-long moving truck where one of it's walls folds down into a giant stage, revealing a wild live glass blowing show. Our craft features 1200 degree celsius molten glass, fire, a collision of creative ideas, sassy humor, fire, and fire.


Now imagine taking this truck on tour across North America... 
welcome to the Glass House Fine Art Collective - Indiegogo campaign.




In 2015, Mandy Patchin and I, Kai Scholefield founded this artist's company and successfully built a fully functioning hot glass blowing studio in our very own moving truck! (Yes, we did) The first of its kind in Canada. 


As professional glass blowers, and divas for public attention, we traveled across western Canada, testing our vehicle & equipment while performing glass blowing feats, telling jokes, and solving crimes (Mandy is a regular Miss Marple).
After performing live shows for thousands of people both indoors and outside at festivals, or hosting small
 classes for all age groups, the overwhelming feedback from all demographics has been incredibly positive. 
So far, our experience has been that this shared experience cultivates awareness and appreciation for art, and each other. 
We are spearheading a passion driven initiative, the mission of which is to create an enterprise out of our sincere desire to share our ideas of art and fun through the burning hot lens of liquid sand. 

As we have gained momentum, and a flair for the dramatic, we noted that we were ready for the next step, a larger road trip. 

T H E      P R O J E C T

This campaign, if funded, will enable us to literally take this dream farther than ever before, bringing our antics and sense of humor to communities in dire need of each across North America.

  All contributions and support will:  Help weather proof the mobile studio by building a adaptable stage cover and framework so we can perform and provide enclosures for shows in rain, snow, tornadoes and hurricanes.  Fund permits and licenses in the many wonderful places, and festivals to be visited.
Provide power- it takes a lot of electricity to put on a good show! Approximately, 30,000 watts of electricity and a special generator is required to power our studio and keep the glass molten hot!






If we don't reach our funding goal, we will thank our supporters, but unfortunately won't be able to make needed changes to our truck, nor power a tour.

Hello.  The builders of Beau Le'Phant (the pink elephant) have a new Mutant Vehicle they would like to bring to BRC this year, The Bi-Polar Express (BPE).  The team of Dr. Galaxo Magic, Captain Danger Shipwreck and Uncle Charlie have already secured the base vehicle, a 1987 Cushman Turf Truckster.  Uncle Charlie has refurbished it and we begin construction shortly.
Dr. Galaxo has worked on Mutant Vehicles since 2001,  Captain Danger was lead builder of Beau Le'Phant (2011, 2012) and Uncle Charlie helped build Beau.  Now Uncle Charlie has become the lead builder of the Bi-Polar Express (BPE).  The BPE will feature a locomotive and coal car, plus one to two Circus Cage cars being pulled by the locomotive.  The Circus Cage cars will transport the wild animals of BRC around the desert in caged delight.
We expect the BPE to cost around $3000 to bring to BRC.  We just need a little help to bring this awesome train to the folks of BRC. 
We have several Perks that we think will fit any budget and might work for you to help us.Beau Le'Phant was a huge success on the playa in 2011 and 2012 but it took 3 days to assemble Beau once we were on the playa.  The BPE will be built and transported to the playa on a flatbed trailer.  That way, the BPE can return again and again to BRC.  And the BPE can make appearances away from BRC, like parades and regional Burning events.

We successfully built Beau Le'Phant with no blueprints, the BPE will use our expertise to bring lighting, steampunk, the circus, a train, color, sound and amusement to the folks of BRC.

So please help us make this an awesome Mutant Vehicle by donate to the Bi-Polar Express.

</p><p><b>YOU can help us exhibit art quilts from the Walsh Collection!  </b>The Texas Quilt Museum needs your help to pay for shipping costs.<br/></p><p>We invite quilt lovers to help us ship 54 art quilts from the world-famous collection of John M. Walsh III for our Fall 2014 exhibition season.  This will be the first major exhibition of the Walsh Collection quilts in Texas and the <i>most comprehensive display anywhere</i> of his quilts!  We are the only quilt museum in the American 
Southwest (texasquiltmuseum.org), celebrating our second-year 
anniversary. (We are a 501 c 3 organization.)</p>
<p>WHY SHOULD YOU HELP?  John Walsh has been collecting for more than 20 years, and his collection represents the very best in art quilts.  Opening in early October and running through mid-December, the Walsh exhibition will be a blockbuster show, completely filling the Texas Quilt Museum.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE YOU HELPING US PURCHASE?  You are helping to pay for a professional art transport company to bring the quilts cross country via truck from the Walsh storage facility to La Grange.  We are applying for grant money to pay for returning the quilts via art transport.</p>
<p>WHY ARE WE ASKING FOR SO MUCH MONEY?  Art transport is quite expensive, and we need $4000 to pay for one-way shipping.  Also, administrative costs from IndieGoGo and First Giving 
take approximately ten percent of money contributed.  (Your receipt from The Quilt Institute will 
be emailed by First Giving, which manages the IndieGoGo non-profit 
campaigns.)</p>
<p>If we happen to exceed our goal, additional funding will be applied 
to the Museum's exhibitions budget. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Any amount of donation is very much appreciated.  Please note that,

<h3>The Basics</h3>
<p>Working under the nom de guerre of Rustbelt Cartography, I've been a professional cartographer for about 20 years and a self-acknowledged artist for about ten years. As an artist, I have found success selling my prints in Cleveland, Ohio when I was living there and I have succeeded in entering several group and juried shows with my art. I was also artist-in-residence at The Art Dogs studio in Gardiner, Maine.</p>
<p>This effort is a little different from the artwork that I have produced in the past in that it is a combination of my profession (map design) and my passion (art). While i have played a prominent role in numerous shows in both Ohio and Maine, this is my first solo show.</p>
<p>Submitting a handful of pieces to an art show is not very difficult, but an entire show is difficult because the up-front costs increase significantly. For instance, the cost of a frame will run about $75–$100 for each piece. (Consider that the next time you're in an art gallery!)</p>
<p>Contributions to this campaign will pay for those up-front costs that prevent struggling artists—such as myself—with the working capital to put this show together.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>My needs</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>I need money. I'm sorry to be so blunt, but after being laid off from my job about a year ago, my finances have been limited. Any contibutions that are submitted will go for very specific materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>Picture frames. I've already mentioned their expense! Frames will consume approximately 90% of this campaign.</li>
<li>Paper for printmaking supplies. The blocks are already cut, but printmaking paper is expensive</li>
<li>Perks. You'll make a contribution for this project, but you'll also help with its promotion.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it. No hidden agenda!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Maybe you can't contribute enough to earn a ""Perk;"" that's ok. Small contributions are also welcome. If you can't contribute cash, please spread the word about this campaign—perhaps someone else that you know shares the belief that Cartography is an Art worthy of its own recognition.</p>
<h3>The Show</h3>
<p>The Lost Maps of Norumbega will be presented in April, 2013 at the <a href=""http://www.monkitree.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Monkitree Gallery</a> in <a href=""http://goo.gl/maps/140aq"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Map"">Gardiner, Maine</a>. As more details are available (specific dates, opening reception, and so on), I will post them here and in an email to my supporters. If you can be in Maine during the late spring of 2013, I encourage you to visit the show!</p>
<p>The show itself will feature my maps utilizing a variety of media: block printing, ink illustrations, and watercolor. As the development progresses, additional media may also be employed as appropriate.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Will Graham.  I am a professional artist who is looking to expand artistically, and bring exposure to other talented, but struggling artists.</p>
<p>Will Graham is a globally collected, Canadian born muti-media artist. He has exhibited in galleries from London, to New York, and gained world recognition with ‘sell out’ art shows and several of his pieces featuring in numerous publications, and prominent locations, such as the iconic LED billboards in Times Square.  His work is heavily influenced by Van Gogh, Monet, and the neo impressionists, and has been compared to the likes of Tim Burton, and David Bollt.  However, due to the self-taught nature of his paintings he is in a class all his own, using bold lines and vibrant colours to stand out among the rest.  He is a successful tattoo artist, experienced graphic designer, and award winning chalk artist.</p>
<p>To know more about me, check out my website at <a href=""http://www.willgrahamgallery.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.willgrahamgallery.com</a></p>
<p>Art is so underappreciated in this day and age.  And so much of it goes unnoticed largely because showcasing art is expensive and space is limited.</p>
<p>It is my hope with this campaign, to secure a creative studio space and gallery.  The studio space would allow me to create the large pieces I have plans for, unhindered by the shortcomings of my basement.   Among the new collections I have plans for, is a series of portraits of infamous buildings.  Such as the Dakota Building, where John Lennon was shot and killed.  I am seeking to tell a story with these pieces, and bring the history of these iconic buildings to the public eye.  It is my vision that this studio will offer space to other artists needing a creative outlet to work from, but do not have, nor can they afford to rent an appropriate space.  This studio space would also house a public gallery to showcase my art collections.  This gallery would also offer public exposure for the many fine artists in London and surrounding area, by allowing them to showcase their work as well. The unique and personal gifts hand-crafted by our artists, as well as the original paintings created by the artists showcasing in this gallery will reflect the creativity of the thriving arts community in our region.</p>
<p>A professional studio space to work from and a public upscale gallery which is accessible by all artists who may need it, is in my opinion, a facility that has a real need in this community.  Providing more exposure for local artists and engaging the public with more awareness of the arts is goal that has benefit for everyone.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This project has come at a crucial time in my career.  I run a successful business that operates on the reputation of the artists that work out of my tattoo studio.  The Neon Crab Tattoos &amp; Piercing studio runs like a well oiled machine.  For the first time, I have the ability to focus my efforts on a truly artistic endeavor.  Hundreds of artists will be able to create and display their art.  But we need your help!</p>
<p>Your contribution will play a key role in the financing of such a large undertaking. With your donation, large or small, you will pledge that you believe, like us, that art is an integral component of a healthy community.  Through our art we can challenge perception and provoke change in a positive manner.  By supporting us, you will become a member of our ever-growing creative family, and you will stand beside us as we spread our message.</p>
<p>In recognition of your support, certain ""perks"" will be made available.  Everything from recognition on our highly trafficked websites and social media outlets to VIP tickets to the opening night of the gallery are available as a thank you for your contribution.  Please, pledge today.  We deeply appreciate your help.</p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For those in the art world, we know the term 'starving artist' is very real, and it is very difficult to actually make a living creating art.  I know first hand the stuggles an artist goes through to simply do what they love doing.  I studied art all though school, I worked in print and lithography, I moved into graphic design before discovering tattoo art.  I quickly moved into that arena, and thrived there for years.  I regularly work with chalk in street painting events, have created murals and corporate art to make ends meet, and all the while I have worked to gain recognition for my own personal oil on canvas paintings.  Only now, after what seems like a lifetime of pushing myself as an artist, do I feel that I am starting to gain some recognition.  It's been a long journey, as it has been for many other artists just like me.  So it should be of no surprise, but your support (financially and spiritually) is keeping my dream alive and allowing me to continue to develop as an artist. Without your ongoing contributions I would not be this far along in my career. Thank you for believing in me and allowing me to continue on this creative journey.  And with this project, we will help many other struggling artists gain the recognition they deserve.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Whether you can afford to donate $1000 or $1, every dollar helps and is immensely appreciated. Some people just can’t contribute financially, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help.  This fundraiser has to be about our energy and positive spirits. In order for us to succeed in creating this community art gallery, your role in personally asking friends, family, artists, and art lovers to support us is equally as important. </p>
<p>Pass on this message through email, facebook, and personally reaching out to your friends and family, share us through indiegogo tools. and together we can make this project a reality</p>

<h3>Bigger is Better!</h3>
<p>My name is Rod Lindauer. I've been a full time artist for twelve years, mostly as a sculptor and furniture maker. I recently seriously injured my left hand in a shop accident, making me unable to work in my traditional media for several months. I have always been interested in antique film photopraphy and had been working off and on as time and funds permitted to build a very large format film camera and perfect the chemistry and techniques required to make large glass plate negatives. I am trying to build a camera that will allow me to take life sized portaits and contact print those onto handmade photographic paper. These techniques date back to the dawn of photography, and are as tedious, cumbersome, and uncertain as today's digital photography is thoughtless and perfect. The funding for this project will allow me to push past the experimental phase and replace my cardboard prototype with a durable camera and pay for the chemistry and paper that I need to make negatives and photographs. The result will be a totally handmade photograph, with all the artifacts and imperfections that come with that. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>A huge negative means bigger everything.</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge for my project was to find a lens large enough to cover such a huge negative. Large lenses are very expensive and most of those will only cover a negative that is 8x10 inches, the size of the most common large film still available. The answer to my problem was a lens from a very old machine that duplicated poster art. Now I need a camera to mount it on. That means I'll have to build one. My cardboard test camera revealed that I need six feet of bellows between the lens and the film to produce a portrait. That's a big ass camera! The negatives will be three feet by three feet. That means large trays for coating and processing the images and lots of silver nitrate, gelatin, and developer. The funding from this site is the only way I'll be able to afford to take this to the next level.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why go to so much trouble for a photograph?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Kodak is going to stop making film. It's a digital world now. Every phone is a camera and a dozen apps can make you Andsel Adams. Why bother? I like the idea that this giant dinosaur of a camera will be the polar opposite of convienient. It will take all day to make just one photograph. If you sit for your portrait, you will have to be perfectly still for several minutes. It's not a disposable thing. It will take time and skill and the result will never be perfect.</p>
<h3>I'm poor, how can I help?</h3>
<p>If you can't donate and you like the idea, you can help spread the word. Put me on your Facebook page or pin me in Pinterest. I'd really appreciate it!</p>

</div></div>","PLEASE NOTE THIS FUNDRAISER IS SUSPENDED for the time being. The tone of the convention itself has changed so dramatically given recent events in and around Phil Cambpell, Alabama, that we are refocusing our efforts on ways to help the tornado-stricken town (the town's Hoedown has been canceled). Ultimately, we will be trying to a) provide direct help to the residents of Phil Campbell, and b) draw attention to the town's urgent needs. Whatever money earned here will redirected into our new fundraising efforts . If anyone who's already given has a problem with that, as our mission has changed, please contact me ASAP and I will arrange to reimburse you.thanks! phil campbell (Brooklyn)==============

<p>For almost a year now, we at Project Project have provided
the city of Omaha and the surrounding region with exciting new contemporary art
exhibitions featuring the work of many extremely talented artists, many of whom
are showing in Omaha for the first time. On top of that, we have been able to
use our space and resources to host lectures and concerts which adds to our
monthly exhibition schedule. Plus we have had a lot of fun and we love giving
back to our community and its artists.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, we have gladly covered all of the
costs for this space with money from our own pockets, but we want to offer
more. To this point, the space has been rent-free but that will soon change. We
are also unable to offer any sort of compensation to our exhibiting artists
aside from 80% of sales, meals and beers. We want to take Project Project to
the next level, and that is where we hope you come in</p>
<p>We are resurrecting an Omaha art tradition by hosting a $100
Art Sale. Unlike previous, similar events, not one penny will be spent anywhere
aside from rent for the space, new exhibitions and gallery upkeep. We have no
interest in making money off of Project Project or the artists that choose to
show there. Another year of supporting artists could be funded by the sale of
just 42 pieces. </p>
<p>We are holding this online portion of the fundraiser so that
friends of the gallery who are out of town or people that cannot attend will be able to help contribute as
well. Thanks for taking the time to hear our request. Have a great day!</p><br/></div>","Hey there!

of the INDIE GOGO community to turn a project he initially created into
 something he could only dream of creating by molding this record into 
the beautiful piece of art it was intended to be.A little goes a 
long way when stretching for the final push, which includes funding for 
film, development of film, renting a camera, buying cowboy boots, and procuring a large transparent 
water container. It's very important to meet this objective as he cannot do this on his own. We've got a lot of great rewards you can see them below or to the column at the right. Albert is looking forward to making this Indie GOGO campaign all it can be.   The ImpactThis album was birthed from water and fire damage to an apartment Albert once lived in. He now wants to return the album to the same fate as it's birth. It is a circle of life. The essence of good mixed with the proponents of evil. This is something not everyone gets to experience in their own lifetime, let alone the same year as its birth.

<p>            Hello, Spinbliss.com is a web based business that also intends to have a local brick and mortar presence with the mission of promoting and supporting the arts, entertainment, and culture on a local, national, and global scale.  Spinbliss.com intends to be the premier resource for artist, crafters, and arts o<span>rganizations </span> to gain maximum exposure and distribution to a more diverse, worldly audience. </p>
<p>            Your contribution today will help us complete more features on the site, which will add value to those who are already willing to use the site and to those who might use it in the future. </p>
<p>            Your donation today will also go a long way toward helping artist, crafters, and arts organizations achieve their goals as well because that is what the site is for.  So your donation will ultimately help them. </p>
<p>            We also want to create a platform for the average person to be able to discover all the unique independent creative stuff that is all around them. </p>
<p>            We are providing an avenue for everyone to be able to promote and/or discover their own bliss. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>            We need to write code for the site and to do that we need money to pay our coders (programmers).  We have three super people employed as coders at Spinbliss and we would like to hire more to speed up the process so that we can bring these great features to the public faster. </p>
<p>            Your donation today will bring you closer to being able to enjoy a fully functional website, but you can also choose other rewards such as a CD from Mercury Descends, prints from artist Rashelle Dawn, Philly Johnmeyer, Craig Downs, and Chris Sabatino.  There are also handmade hand bags from Kassioh, as well as stickers and T-shirts from Spinbliss.  We are also giving away some free perks to be used on the site and  VIP invitations to our launch party.   </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>          Your, donation today will have a bigger impact than you can probably imagine.</p>
<p>1<sup>st</sup>.  Your donation will obviously have an impact on Spinbliss and the employees who will receive a paycheck because of your donation. </p>
<p>2<sup>nd</sup>.  Of course there is always an economic multiplier effect to consider as well.  When we pay our coders, with your donation, they will go spend that money somewhere else.  (Which creates even more jobs and stimulates the economy.)</p>
<p>3<sup>rd</sup>.  Your donation will help build the premier platform for artist, crafters, and arts organizations to promote and distribute their stuff.  This means that they will create another revenue stream for themselves  which in-turn will multiply also….(Creating jobs and stimulating the economy even more.)</p>
<p>4<sup>th</sup>. When you make a donation you will also receive a reward or perk and someone has to make those perks.  So the manufactures (who make the perks) will pay their employees to make the rewards, possibly have to hire more people to keep up with demand and thus stimulate the economy even more. </p>
<p>5<sup>th</sup>. Last but not least is the impact those will feel when they use the site.  They might find some amazing inspirational video that seems to answer all the questions about life they had, or someone might be able to reach a new contact and collaborate on a new awesome project, or maybe an up and coming artist in France could start to develop a huge following in Brazil. </p>
<p>          The possibilities for the impact of your donation are limitless, but it does seem that you will help bring art, entertainment, and culture to those who need and want it most… and at the same time possibly solve a major economic problem too. </p>
<p>Seems like a no brainer.  Really great perks and really great outcomes. </p>

<h3>A Little About Us</h3>
</div>
<div>I am a print-maker living at <a href=""http://milepost5.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Milepost 5</a>, a community for creatives in Portland, Oregon.  150 artists, writers, film makers, and musicians  live, work, and create together here in an historic, slate-roofed mannor.  As emerging artists, resources are hard to come by, so we rely on eachother and share resources (for example, the video for this campaign was put together by a film-maker in the building, earlier this year, my dog appeared in one of his projects).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All of us came here to launch or advance our creative careers.  In order to do that, we need to be able to produce engaging and graphicly pleasing promotional materials, book covers, CD jackets, flyers, and posters.  We have made-do with a cobbled together, single color screen printing set-up untill now, but to do this thing right, we need the right equipment.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
</div>
<div>In order to create the visually striking book covers, CD sleaves, posters, broadsides, and fine art prints necessary to make our collective mark, we need a <strong>Four Color Silk Screen Press</strong>.  Buying a new, commerially made press could cost  <a href=""http://atlasscreensupply.net/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=5_239_241&amp;products_id=1231"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">thousands of dollars</a>,  but we have the skills and tools to build one for $500.  Thats where <strong>YOU</strong> come in: one contribution from you supports the careers of over a hundrad artists!</div>
<p>$500 is the bare minimum we need to make this happen.  Any additional funds raised, above the cost of building the press, will go towards essentials such as emulsion, ink, and paying for the space where the press will be located.  Additional funding will also allow us to make the press available to local schools and community groups. This is a project that never stops giving!</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your help, we will be able to make everything from promotional items to fine art prints  ~in <em>technocolor</em>!  Your donation will help not just one person, but <span style=""font-style: italic;"">a hundrad and fifty,</span> to live and thrive from their creative process. Your donation ensures our continued ability to pursue creative endevors and ability to reach our full potential.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"" style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">Having a four-color press will also enhance our ability to serve our community partners: the schools, community groups, and non-profits with whome we collaborate and create.</p>

</div></div>","A Little About Us

I am a print-maker living at Milepost 5, a community for creatives in Portland, Oregon.  150 artists, writers, film makers, and musicians  live, work, and create together here in an historic, slate-roofed mannor.  As emerging artists, resources are hard to come by, so we rely on eachother and share resources (for example, the video for this campaign was put together by a film-maker in the building, earlier this year, my dog appeared in one of his projects).
 
All of us came here to launch or advance our creative careers.  In order to do that, we need to be able to produce engaging and graphicly pleasing promotional materials, book covers, CD jackets, flyers, and posters.  We have made-do with a cobbled together, single color screen printing set-up untill now, but to do this thing right, we need the right equipment.
 

What We Need

In order to create the visually striking book covers, CD sleaves, posters, broadsides, and fine art prints necessary to make our collective mark, we need a Four Color Silk Screen Press.  Buying a new, commerially made press could cost  thousands of dollars,  but we have the skills and tools to build one for $500.  Thats where YOU come in: one contribution from you supports the careers of over a hundrad artists!
$500 is the bare minimum we need to make this happen.  Any additional funds raised, above the cost of building the press, will go towards essentials such as emulsion, ink, and paying for the space where the press will be located.  Additional funding will also allow us to make the press available to local schools and community groups. This is a project that never stops giving!
 

The Impact
With your help, we will be able to make everything from promotional items to fine art prints  ~in technocolor!  Your donation will help not just one person, but a hundrad and fifty, to live and thrive from their creative process. Your donation ensures our continued ability to pursue creative endevors and ability to reach our full potential.
Having a four-color press will also enhance our ability to serve our community partners: the schools, community groups, and non-profits with whome we collaborate and create.
With one contribution, you do a world of good!

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>The <a href=""http://workshopforcommunityarts.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Workshop for Community Arts"">Workshop for Community Arts</a> is a community-based and artist-run organization located in Santa Ana that facilitates creative workshops and events.  With expertise in creative writing, visual art, music, and community organizing, we use our experience, resources, and craft to engage in collaborative art-making and create opportunities for people to share their stories. </p>
<h3>
<br/>The Project</h3>
Cartonera Cartography (Aug 4th-18th) is a community art project which brings artists and residents together in collaboration to create – by means of writing, photography, art, and cardboard – a cartonera “guidebook” of Santa Ana. In a series of workshops, participants will explore and document the places and experiences that, for them, represent the “essence” of Santa Ana: <em>What do I see that you do not see? What do I love about this city and have never told anyone? </em> <a href=""http://uwdc.library.wisc.edu/collections/Arts/EloisaCart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cartonera</a> bookmaking is a form which first began in Latin America and which invites active community participation in the process of making and publishing books, a process which thereby promotes accessibility, creativity, and self-sufficiency, as well as environmental responsibility by using recycled materials. With the guidance of Nicole Cecilia Delgado, an internationally-recognized cartonera artist (<a href=""http://vimeo.com/24390224"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hear her talk about cartonera here</a> ), participants will see their words and ideas come to life. They will be trained in cartonera bookmaking, resulting in the publication and distribution of over 120 handmade guidebooks throughout Santa Ana. The final “guidebook” about the city Santa Ana will be a community document – created by, for, with, and in the community.</div>

<p>We're trying to raise $1,500 to help cover the costs of the Cartonera Cartography.  And, realistically, this only covers part of what it takes to put on this kind of event.  We've had many generous donations of time, talent, and supplies.  BUT there are still things that we have to pay for, and that's where this fundraising drive comes in.  Your donation on this website will help for travel expenses to get our amazing guest artist from Puerto Rico (where she runs Atarray Cartonera) to Santa Ana, California.  And for bookmaking supplies -- because we can't make books without'em!</p>
<p>And we have some really nice handmade thank-you gifts which we will send you if you donate at the following levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>For $5 dollars, show your support for art in the community and in return we offer our profound gratitude!</li>
<li>An artist-designed hand-stenciled cartonera postcard in your mailbox! for a $25 donation.</li>

</div></div>","Who We Are
The Workshop for Community Arts is a community-based and artist-run organization located in Santa Ana that facilitates creative workshops and events.  With expertise in creative writing, visual art, music, and community organizing, we use our experience, resources, and craft to engage in collaborative art-making and create opportunities for people to share their stories. 

The Project
Cartonera Cartography (Aug 4th-18th) is a community art project which brings artists and residents together in collaboration to create – by means of writing, photography, art, and cardboard – a cartonera “guidebook” of Santa Ana. In a series of workshops, participants will explore and document the places and experiences that, for them, represent the “essence” of Santa Ana: What do I see that you do not see? What do I love about this city and have never told anyone?  Cartonera bookmaking is a form which first began in Latin America and which invites active community participation in the process of making and publishing books, a process which thereby promotes accessibility, creativity, and self-sufficiency, as well as environmental responsibility by using recycled materials. With the guidance of Nicole Cecilia Delgado, an internationally-recognized cartonera artist (hear her talk about cartonera here ), participants will see their words and ideas come to life. They will be trained in cartonera bookmaking, resulting in the publication and distribution of over 120 handmade guidebooks throughout Santa Ana. The final “guidebook” about the city Santa Ana will be a community document – created by, for, with, and in the community.

<p>I would like to introduce you to my father, Vince Semary.  He is the greatest man I know.  My father is an accomplished artist, teacher, business man, football player and coach.  He began his life as one of three sons of immigrant parents from Italy and Sicily.  Vince grew up in the inner city of Cleveland, Ohio in the 1940's and '50's, a time he looks back on with great fondness.  Stories of working for Uncle Joe, the shoemaker, hopping trains along Train Avenue to go downtown with his pals to visit the Cleveland Museum of Art where lessons were free, afternoons filled with playing outdoors; cornerlot baseball, football, wrestling and exploring trainyards and alleys, and a mother whose sole purpose in life was to make her sons and husband happy, fill my father's memories.  It was a time of innocence, of discovery, of hope and dreams.  Dreams, that at times, seemed out of reach, given his poor performance in school.</p>
<p>While he didn't shine brightly in the classroom, he loved to draw.  His third grade teacher began calling him ""Michaelangelo"" and sent him off to paint murals throughout the school, boosting his self-confidence.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was West Tech High School, an early prototype of a magnet school.  It offered him the opportunity to major in art, receiving thorough training as well as preparation for college.  Vince majored in art and played football, two things he had always felt passionate about.</p>
<p>""The art was there for me.  I was able to find my way through it.  The art department was very diversified and we were provided with a strong commercial background.  But I loved football, too. It was the best of both worlds.  I had a great senior year and, although I lacked the English credits to go to a Big Ten school, I was recruited by Don Schula and accepted by the University of Kentucky on a scholarship. Blanton Collier was coaching at the time, so it was a perfect opportunity.</p>
<p>""I found myself totally lost in art, however.  It was the early sixties and the universities were becoming the mainstream for avant-garde art.  My background was so concrete, that when we were assigned a garden to draw, mine was the only one with recognizable trees, bushes and pathways.  The others were completely abstract. I was told my grade would be affected if I couldn't grasp the concept of abstract expressionism.</p>
<p>""As the end of my term approached, I had five paintings to do in two weeks and a C- average.  In frustration, I went out on the town with my football buddies.  When we got back, we all picked up brushes and did the paintings.  You can imagine what they looked like, but I turned them in and, to my astonishment, the professor raved about them, gave me an A, and said I'd finally grasped the expression of the inner self!  I've laughed about that many times over the years, but the experience did help me to develop a more complex approach to my art"".</p>
<p>After earning his Master's Degree, Vince taught art and coached football at many high schools and universities, finally landing a job at Rice University, which brought him to Houston, Tx. in 1976.  Football and art were a comfortable balance until 1979, when he took an art class from a talented 18-year-old who reintroduced him to watercolors.  </p>
<p>The following year, an admirer of his art commissioned him to produce twenty-four paintings in twelve months, and he's been painting professionally ever since.</p>
<p>In 1978, Vince left coaching and he and his wife Susan opened a gallery in Kingwood, The Shadow Box Gallery, where he taught art and painted.  ""I think like an athlete.  I accept the challenge of coming up with the perfect performance.  Here it's paint across paper instead of a ball across a field.  The goal is still the same.  I want people to like what I do"".</p>
<p>For 34 years now, my father and mother have been in business, and as with all small businesses have seen prosperous times and hard times.  The last four years they have been hit hard by the economic downturn our country has been in and by mounting bills and expenses to keep the business doors open.  Facing retirement with a mound of debt is stressful to say the least.  Meanwhile, the gallery is full of beautiful original paintings by my father and stacks of prints.</p>
<p>In an effort to help them with the debt and move some of this gorgeous work, and share with the world the talent of Vince Semary, we are asking for your donations in return for his work.  For each level of donations, you will receive a beautiful print, set of prints, or at the highest level of donations, an original commissioned art work of your choice of subject matter.</p>
<p>You will receive the artwork, and we will receive the funds to help pay off mounting debt and the hope for a peaceful retirement for two people who have worked hard their whole lives to bring beauty into the world through art.  There could be no greater gift than peace of mind for these small business owners who have lived a life of passion and purpose to do something good in this world and provide for their family.  </p>

These were a series of paintings Vince did in commemoration of the Humble Good Oil Days from 1981-1984.The following is a brief history of Humble, Tx.</p>
<p><em><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial;"">Just before the Civil War, a wandering fisherman named P.S. (Pleasant) Humble brought his family into the area. They settled on the banks of the San Jacinto River and operated a ferry near the present U.S. 59 crossing. A flood drove his family away from the river in search of higher ground. Soon a small community began forming in the area.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial;"">A pioneer oil boom town. Originated as crossroads community named for settler <strong>Pleasant Smith Humble (1835?-1912)</strong>, who lived here before 1889, hewing his timber into railroad ties, mining gravel from his land, keeping store, and serving as justice of the peace.</span></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial;"">Economic bases were farms and sawmills. The post office opened 1902. <strong>In 1904 C. E. Barrett (1866-1926) drilled for oil in this area</strong>, securing small production on Moonshine Hill. <strong>On Jan. 7, 1905, he brought in the No. 2 Beaty Well</strong> which yielded 8,500 barrels a day, opening the great boom. From a village of 700, Humble grew at once into a town of 20,000. <strong>Field production-- the largest in Texas for the year 1905-- was 15,594,923 barrels of oil.</strong> The field was named for the town. A group of its <strong>operators, including Ross S. Sterling, later (1931-33) governor of Texas</strong>, in 1911 incorporated a new oil company named for the field, The Humble Oil Company, thus spreading into the annals of world commerce the town's name. Production from several strata here exceeded the total for fabulous Spindletop by 1946. Known as the greatest salt dome field, Humble still produces and the town for which it was named continued to thrive.</span></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial;"">The Humble Oil Company's name was changed to Exxon two decades ago. The opening of Houston Intercontinental Airport was a major local growth catalyst on the late 1960's. Located less than five miles from Humble, this event stimulated development throughout Houston's north side. Soon, subdivision development was initiated nearby. The resultant growth started a transformation of the City of Humble and the surrounding rural homestead areas. <a href=""http://www.kingwoodtexas.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kingwood</a>, Forest Cove, Northshire, <a href=""http://www.atascocitatexas.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Atascocita</a>, <a href=""http://www.eaglespringshomes.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Eagle Springs</a>, Summerwood, <a href=""http://www.texaslandfsbo.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Commons of Lake Houston</a> just to name a few.</span></em></p>

<div>My New Years resolution for this year was to create ninjas for my shop. Previously, I had not really delved into doing such but for someone who really loves ninjas I felt that my shop was seriously deprived of them. In December of 2011, I sent off designs of my very first batch of laser cut arcylic charms to a laser cut supplier. One of them contained my very first ninja design. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In Feburary of this year, I bought my first Tecre button machine. One of my earliest button designs was (you guseed it) of a ninja. Since I have a bit of a soft spot for ninjas and cute things, I figured the latter out and then began to create even more ninja-related items that included clay forms too. </div>

<p> </p>
<h2>""THE MANY FACES OF A NINJA""</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Over the summer, I released a series that titled ""The Many Faces of a Ninja."" This series has so far been very well received among many of my supporters. The series contains eight ninjas and their various forms of faces. They are very simply designed, but I intended to keep it that way since I believe that eyes can tell a plethora of stories by themselves. </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>MY GOAL</strong></h2>
<strong>My objective is to raise $600. This amount is the minimum that I need to cover expenses to order the supplies needed for my project. I plan to order all eight ninja designs as vinyl stickers and 1"" inch laser cut charms.</strong>
</div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div><strong>My supplies include laser cut charms, jewelry components, vinyl stickers, the supplies for pinback buttons, printer ink, chain, cell phone charms, and key rings. All of this comes to around my goal.</strong></div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>
<strong>Any additional that could be raised will help fund rewards for my project and will enable me to order even more supplies!</strong>

<p><strong>More information about laser cut acrylic: </strong></p>
Laser cut acrylic is what many artists including myself have turned to to make our art wearable. This medium is often seen at conventions, online shops, and more. Charms that are acrylic are very resistant. They are shatter proof, scratch resistant, water proof, and very easy to clean if they get dirty or finger prints on them.<strong> </strong>

My New Years resolution for this year was to create ninjas for my shop. Previously, I had not really delved into doing such but for someone who really loves ninjas I felt that my shop was seriously deprived of them. In December of 2011, I sent off designs of my very first batch of laser cut arcylic charms to a laser cut supplier. One of them contained my very first ninja design. 
 
In Feburary of this year, I bought my first Tecre button machine. One of my earliest button designs was (you guseed it) of a ninja. Since I have a bit of a soft spot for ninjas and cute things, I figured the latter out and then began to create even more ninja-related items that included clay forms too. 
 
 

 
 
""THE MANY FACES OF A NINJA""
 
 
Over the summer, I released a series that titled ""The Many Faces of a Ninja."" This series has so far been very well received among many of my supporters. The series contains eight ninjas and their various forms of faces. They are very simply designed, but I intended to keep it that way since I believe that eyes can tell a plethora of stories by themselves. 
 
 
MY GOAL
My objective is to raise $600. This amount is the minimum that I need to cover expenses to order the supplies needed for my project. I plan to order all eight ninja designs as vinyl stickers and 1"" inch laser cut charms.

 
My supplies include laser cut charms, jewelry components, vinyl stickers, the supplies for pinback buttons, printer ink, chain, cell phone charms, and key rings. All of this comes to around my goal.
 

Any additional that could be raised will help fund rewards for my project and will enable me to order even more supplies!
 
 
 PERKS

 
*Please scroll down for instructions on how to leave notes for which ninja you would like in your perk.*
I have many different perks available! Below are some of the things offered

 
 
""The Many Faces of a Ninja"" 4x6 print
 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
I plan to use the following below for the key chains and cell phone lanyards:

<h3>What I need money for</h3>
<p>Making art takes an investment of not only time but also money. Not only for final production, but also for lots, and lots of testing. Here is a rundown of the costs involved in this project.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Half of the budget has been reserved for the creation of my gifts to you!</b><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>3D printing</b><br/>Printing in 3D is still a very new technology. It is really quite cool, but it's not yet cheap, especially in the more exotic materials (Sterling silver for instance). It starts at $1.- and goes up to as much as $20.- per cubic centimetre.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Presentation supplies</b><br/>Boxes, labels, pins, and such all have to be ordered from specialist Entomology suppliers. The boxes have to seal properly, the labels have to be acid free, and the pins rust proof.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Various art, and office supplies</b><br/>Drills, pliers, drill bits, nails, stickers, paper, envelopes, boxes, postage stamps. In short... a multitude of items is required to take the Entoforms from a concept to a finished product.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Space rental</b><br/>In august of 2011 the Entoforms will be exhibited in association with a renowned art gallery in Amsterdam. In this case part of the cost is covered by the gallery and part by the artists.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Foodstuffs</b><br/>For the duration of the project, the artist has to be fed. This keeps him running at peak performance. Unfed he becomes grumpy, uninspired &amp; altogether unproductive.</li>

<h1>THE PROJECT</h1>
<p>April 20 marks the two year anniversary since the biggest oil spill in history. In May I will spend eight days in exile on Horn Island in the Gulf of Mexico. There I will study the longer term effects of the BP spill. Afterwards there will be two exhibitions to raise awareness of the ongoing impact.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Why eight days? When I was a flight attendant. We had a mantra of survival. 3 minutes without air, 30 minutes of exposure, 3 days without water, 7 days without food. Eight days exceeds those numbers. It invokes resource management and supplies enough time to investigate and aquatint myself with the space. - Though I think Andy Goldsworthy would think it 3 or 4 years too short.It causes you to begin to understand and question what is necessary for survival and what is not. Everything I bring will be essential and have purpose for my life.</p>
<p>During the eight days, I will gather information on the islands current state, from found objects, flotsam and jetsam mostly, to making sketches and other documentation. I expect to find signs of the damage of human pollution, including but not limited to the recent gulf oil spill.</p>
<p>After I get back I will create works based on my experience and observations during my exile. These will be displayed in Seattle and Memphis, and will include community outreach events. The overall purpose of the outreach and artwork is to draw attention to the fact that our energy need puts at risk the worlds habitats, and can cause long term consequences.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> We are Spiral Fae Accents (Mitch &amp; Amber) the fairies, or the mask people as we are known throughout these United States. We are known for our beautiful hand crafted leather masks and gemstone jewelery. It is our mission to keep "" hand made"" in the vocabulary of America. For the last four years we have traveled across the country selling our one of a kind artworks, sharing the beauty and happiness with so many people.</p>
<p> You may have seen us at World of Fairies outside of Chicago, Fairie Worlds in Oregon, The Renaissance faire's of Missouri and Kansas or in the company of our beloved and talented musician friend S.J. Tucker.<br/></p>
<p>  We understand that this past year was the hardest it has ever been on every one. Gas prices being so high last year made it much harder to have anything in savings for this years start, and that is where you come in. <br/></p>

 We are Spiral Fae Accents (Mitch & Amber) the fairies, or the mask people as we are known throughout these United States. We are known for our beautiful hand crafted leather masks and gemstone jewelery. It is our mission to keep "" hand made"" in the vocabulary of America. For the last four years we have traveled across the country selling our one of a kind artworks, sharing the beauty and happiness with so many people.
 You may have seen us at World of Fairies outside of Chicago, Fairie Worlds in Oregon, The Renaissance faire's of Missouri and Kansas or in the company of our beloved and talented musician friend S.J. Tucker.
  We understand that this past year was the hardest it has ever been on every one. Gas prices being so high last year made it much harder to have anything in savings for this years start, and that is where you come in.

Yet few people outside of Taiwan are aware of the bravery, passion and self-sacrifice that transformed Taiwan from a one-party state to one of the first democracies in Asia. Taiwan is in the peculiar position of being a country that is not really considered a country, of being a homegrown democracy that should be valued by the Western world, but is instead considered a nuisance and a threat to global peace. International pressure for Taiwan to unite with China rarely considers what would happen to Taiwan’s hard-won civil rights and democracy. The Taiwanese are never part of the One China debate, even though the political status of Taiwan is a central issue. It’s almost as if the Taiwanese don’t exist.</p><p>Some considerations:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>For over 50 years, Taiwan's identity has been subsumed or repressed. Taiwan has its own unique <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Taiwan"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">history</a> and <a href=""http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/asia/taiwan/culture-etiquette/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">culture</a> that deserves to be celebrated. The majority of Taiwanese people are of Chinese descent, but Taiwan is not China. If that sounds confusing, just think of it this way: the U.S. is definitely not England although we speak English in America and a good percentage of us are of English descent. </li>
<li>The Taiwanese should be included in the <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2000/05/what_is_the_onechina_policy.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">One China</a> debate, which is couched as a power struggle between two Chinese powers (the Nationalists and the Communists). All people should have the right of self-determination, but the Taiwanese are never considered when it comes to political jurisdiction over their own island.</li>
<li>Taiwan's freedom of speech, direct elections, and human rights need to be considered in the cry for unification with China. While unification with China may mean ""cross-strait peace"" for the Nationalists and the Communists, it would be a big step backward for the Taiwanese in terms of the democratic rights that they won with much <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Terror_(Taiwan)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tears</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/228_Incident"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bloodshed</a>.</li>
</ul><p></p><p>Efforts to consolidate support for Taiwan’s democracy have largely concentrated on higher political circles. Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA) has been very successful in rallying Congress to sign up for the Taiwan Congressional Caucus. It’s currently the second largest country caucus with over 150 members who receive a steady stream of current information on Taiwan. But advocacy in higher government is only one ingredient of a strong and successful movement; there needs to also be intense international concern and pressure.</p><p>In order to gain the empathy and support of the wider world, it is my belief that artists and grassroots activists need to be engaged. Artists in particular have the loudest voices, the biggest reach, and the deepest influence. Art provides an avenue for people who are not Taiwanese to identify with the movement. <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2012/06/03/154234617/napalm-girl-an-iconic-image-of-war-turns-40"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nick Ut’s iconic photograph</a> of a naked Vietnamese girl running away from a napalm bombing moved many people to join the anti-Vietnam War movement.

The posters would additionally be viewable on a dedicated website and available to purchase online. Art for a Free Taiwan is designed to be sustainable, with a percentage of sales set aside to commission more posters from artists all over the world. Eventually, it is hoped that the project will engage over 25 artists and offer over 50 posters that will cause the general public to stop, think, and be curious enough to investigate the full story of Taiwan’s democracy. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>More about the project</h3><p>
</p><p>This project came from an idea to grow the movement for Taiwan's democracy in tandem with promotional efforts for ALMOST HOME: TAIWAN. 
The basic idea is to utilize resistance art posters to raise awareness of Taiwan’s
precarious democracy. The first stage of this project will be to create posters that would be exhibited and sold in the cities that have already supported ALMOST HOME: TAIWAN. While the art exhibit will include a sneak preview screening of the film, the posters themselves are not advertisements or otherwise connected to the film beyond having the same political viewpoint.
They will stand on their own as dynamic,
provocative, resistance art posters. The project is meant to be self-sustaining and grow into an international movement of art for Taiwan. This initial stage will be comprised
of the following elements: </p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">6-8 artists from the US and Taiwan would be engaged to begin the
project.</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> Artists would be chosen for their renown and/or
connection to grassroots activist movements. Currently we have a commitment from</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> award-winning artist </span><a href=""http://www.lukova.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Luba Lukova</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> and </span><a href=""http://www.justseeds.org/artists/josh_macphee/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Josh MacPhee</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> of </span><a href=""http://interferencearchive.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Interference Archives</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">All posters will state</b><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> “Keep Taiwan Free” or “</b><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">維護台灣民主</b><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">.” </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> This would provide a unifying
theme for these posters, which will be of vastly different styles, although
they will all be within the resistance art vernacular.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Proceeds from the sale of the posters would be split between the
film and the artist</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">,
after a small percentage is reserved for future commissions and upkeep of the
website. This would provide an added incentive for artists to take part in the
project. The proceeds would also grow the project by allowing us to commission more artists and print more posters. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Posters will be exhibited in 3-5 cities</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">: New York, Boston, Washington
DC, San Francisco, and/or Seattle (or Portland, OR). The tour will coincide with
commemorations of the 228 Massacre in 2014. Each city has already supported the film
and has a strong base of attendants for an art opening and film preview. In
each city, an art gallery known for political work will be secured for 1-3 days. The art opening would feature a sneak preview screening of the film and posters available for purchase. Where possible, we will also
engage a speaker or possibly a panel for a town-hall style discussion about
Taiwan.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A website will be created to exhibit and sell the posters. </b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The website will will not only offer posters for sale, but also provide links to books, films, music and other artistic works about Taiwan, to additionally grow
interest and awareness.</span>
</li>

We'll screen the film, talk up Taiwan and exhibit 6 to 8 posters created by artists in Taiwan and the United States in the tradition of resistance art from the Spanish Civil War, the United Farm Workers movement, and Mai 1968.

The music of Hugh Masekela and Ladysmith Black Mombazo broadened international awareness of the anti-apartheid movement. The documentary film Burma VJ introduced the world to the injustices of the military dictatorship in Myanmar.Art for a Free Taiwan seeks to jumpstart international awareness of Taiwan’s precarious democracy through commissioning six political artists to create posters that would be exhibited in five cities. The posters would additionally be viewable on a dedicated website and available to purchase online. Art for a Free Taiwan is designed to be sustainable, with a percentage of sales set aside to commission more posters from artists all over the world. Eventually, it is hoped that the project will engage over 25 artists and offer over 50 posters that will cause the general public to stop, think, and be curious enough to investigate the full story of Taiwan’s democracy. More about the project
This project came from an idea to grow the movement for Taiwan's democracy in tandem with promotional efforts for ALMOST HOME: TAIWAN. 
The basic idea is to utilize resistance art posters to raise awareness of Taiwan’s
precarious democracy. The first stage of this project will be to create posters that would be exhibited and sold in the cities that have already supported ALMOST HOME: TAIWAN. While the art exhibit will include a sneak preview screening of the film, the posters themselves are not advertisements or otherwise connected to the film beyond having the same political viewpoint.
They will stand on their own as dynamic,
provocative, resistance art posters. The project is meant to be self-sustaining and grow into an international movement of art for Taiwan. This initial stage will be comprised
of the following elements: 


6-8 artists from the US and Taiwan would be engaged to begin the
project. Artists would be chosen for their renown and/or
connection to grassroots activist movements. Currently we have a commitment from award-winning artist Luba Lukova and Josh MacPhee of Interference Archives. 


All posters will state “Keep Taiwan Free” or “維護台灣民主.”  This would provide a unifying
theme for these posters, which will be of vastly different styles, although
they will all be within the resistance art vernacular.


Proceeds from the sale of the posters would be split between the
film and the artist,
after a small percentage is reserved for future commissions and upkeep of the
website. This would provide an added incentive for artists to take part in the
project. The proceeds would also grow the project by allowing us to commission more artists and print more posters. 


Posters will be exhibited in 3-5 cities: New York, Boston, Washington
DC, San Francisco, and/or Seattle (or Portland, OR). The tour will coincide with
commemorations of the 228 Massacre in 2014. Each city has already supported the film
and has a strong base of attendants for an art opening and film preview. In
each city, an art gallery known for political work will be secured for 1-3 days. The art opening would feature a sneak preview screening of the film and posters available for purchase. Where possible, we will also
engage a speaker or possibly a panel for a town-hall style discussion about
Taiwan.


A website will be created to exhibit and sell the posters. The website will will not only offer posters for sale, but also provide links to books, films, music and other artistic works about Taiwan, to additionally grow
interest and awareness.



Artists who are involvedHerewith in alphabetical order are bios for the amazing artists who are contributing to this phase of Art for a Free Taiwan, followed by an example of their work. If you're interested in finding out about Victoria Linchong, check out her personal website. Peter Kuper's illustrations and comics appear regularly in Time, Newsweek, The New York Times, and MAD, where he illustrates SPY vs. SPY every month. His most recent books are adaptions of Franz Kafka's The Metamorphosis, Upton Sinclair's The Jungle and Sticks and Stones, a wordless graphic novel about the rise and fall of empires, which was awarded the gold medal in the sequential arts category in the 2004 Society of Illustrators competition. In 1979 he co-founded the political comix magazine World War 3 Illustrated and remains on its editorial board to this day. Since 1986 he has taught courses in comics and illustration at the School of Visual Arts and currently at Parsons in New York City. Luba Lukova is a Bulgarian-born artist and designer widely regarded for her editorial illustrations for The New York Timesand has received commissions for her work from the Wall Street Journal, Time, Adobe Systems, Sony Music and Harvard University. Lukova has won many awards including Grand Prix Savignac at the International Poster Salon, Paris, France; the Golden Pencil Award at the One Club, New York; ICOGRADA Excellence Award at the Poster Festival in Chaumont, France; and Honor Laureate at the International Poster Exhibition in Fort Collins, CO. Solo exhibitions of her work have been held at UNESCO, Paris; DDD Gallery, Osaka, Japan; La MaMa, New York and the Art Institute of Boston. Her work is included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the Library of Congress, Washington, DC; and Bibliotheque Nationale de France. Josh MacPhee is a designer, artist, activist, and archivist. Founder of the Justseeds political graphics collective, MacPhee is author or editor of five books and curator of two major touring exhibitions on political art and the visual culture of protest. Since 1998, he has commissioned over 100 posters in the Celebrate People’s History series, which was published in book form in 2010. Most recently, MacPhee co–founded the Interference Archive, a zine archive and exhibition space in Brooklyn that collects and displays socially–engaged art and activist publications. Mac McGill is a pen and ink artist whose work has been published in World War III Illustrated, Tikkun Magazine, The Amsterdam News, Chimurenga Magazine (South Africa), Warburger Comix (Slovenia) and The Black Panther Community News Service. His illustrations have also appeared in several books, among them, Mumia Abu-Jamal’s All Things Censored (Seven Stories Press), Wobblies! A Graphic History of the Industrial Workers of the World (Verso), and The Quotable Rebel...Political Quotations for Dangerous Times (Common Courage Press). IX XI MMI, eight pen-and-ink images of the events of 9/11, was featured at Exit Art in New York City in early 2002 and subsequently purchased by the Library of Congress and the Brooklyn Museum of Art. His work has also exhibited internationally in Portugal, Greece, and Italy, as well as at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine and ABC No Rio in New York City.  Nicole Schulman is known for her comics, posters and illustrations which have appeared in The New York Times, The Progressive, and Inguine Mah!gazine (Italy), as well as in World War 3 Illustrated — of which she is on the editorial board. She has never made much of an attempt to break into the gallery world, yet through the prodding and hard work of other people, Nicole's work has been exhibited in Exit Art, in 3 Cities Against the Wall exhibition (shown simultaneously in New York, Tel Aviv and Hebron), The Art Museum of Ravenna during the Komikazen Festival 2005, and the Brooklyn Historical Society. Her comic from the 911 issue of WW3 is in the permanent collection of the Library of Congress.Wang LeWei is a Taiwanese illustrator whose work has been exhibited throughout Taiwan and in Hong Kong. Your DonationWe are thrilled that Taiwan Foundation for Democracy gave us a $3,000 grant for this project, but now we need to match it! Their donation will go towards gallery rental, printing of posters, and travel. We need you to help us with the following expenses: 
Artist and administrative fees (allow $1,200) 
Framing and shipping of 6 posters (allow $1,200) 
Design and launch of website that will not only offer posters for sale, but also be a central online location for books, films, music and other artistic works about Taiwan (allow $600) 
This is the minimum we need to make this project happen. With another $1000-$2000, we could have the exhibit up for a whole weekend and we'll also be able to afford a reception for the opening. So please tell your friends. Any donation, big or small, will help make this project a reality! Other Ways You Can HelpThis campaign can only be successful if it reaches as many people as possible. Please share it on your facebook page, write about it on your blog, and send the link to friends whom you think would like to support democracy in Taiwan. Thank you!",6.0,2,"3 Campaigns

</div></div>","Nad Ronnoco (Dan Oconnor backwards), born 1973 in Rahway New Jersey, never formally trained in any school, but started drawing the funnys in the news paper with his mother. She then gave him a set of oils and let him at it, creating nothing but mud his first 100 tries, he then watched Bob Ross on channel 13 pbs and watched and watched until he started creating his own landsacapes. rough around the edges, and not patient he gave up on oils.After taking a fifteen year break and facing some trials and tribulations and some of lifes unexpected tragedies in 1999 he picked up his brushes with a new vigor and zest for life and art. a passion that has satyed with him since.His style is diverse and not consistent but explores many different styles with his own insight and eye for color and fun energetic paintings....... his ever changing style is what he calls his niche, he chooses to not be drawn to one style or range but to explore, like a true Gemini from one to the next and finding new experiences to drive his art. He never looked to do anything but paint and be able to continue his love and passion for art.... a true lover of nature and lifes mysteries come follow him as he evolves...


MY VISION. As follows: I am an artist, I am a sculptor, a painter, a photographer, most of all these I love art.... What I am not, definitely not a business person,  or salesperson, or a marketeer, these things I am sure of.....another thing I am sure of is that most people don't have thousands of dollars to spend on awesome , fantastic, artwork that they love....this needs not change, and I am the one who is willing to do it.....my goal is to get art in to those who otherwise normally couldn't afford it but certainly deserve , and desire , original artwork.......I don't  want there only options for affordable art to be Department Stores for there ""sofa matching art"".   I can create fantastic paintings in many genre's, large sizes and on a budget similar to the large chains.  Not prints, not duplicates, all originals on canvas or muslin, gallery wrapped and signed.      Art is to be seen ,enjoyed ,shared, and like music it should be  affordable and enjoyed with out breaking the bank.....my goal is to create 100 paintings for this year and sell not one painting of this series for more than 300$ for the largest 36x48  and most entry level 20x26, 24x24, 30x40, 24x56 priced on a sliding scale starting at 50$.  


The budget for this project includes: canvas, paint, photography and online store.

<p>I have been hard at work all summer perfecting the process to make a better, stronger, and more effective pair of glasses and feel confident with the progress that has been made thus far.  The official release date will now be sometime this August or September.  Please stay on the lookout or follow this project on Twitter at twitter.com/ProperWood.</p>

<h3>Proper Eyewear - Made in Milwaukee</h3>
<p>My name is Josh Rickun, I'm a glasses wearing, nearsighted student at the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design, part time graphic designer, concert poster maker, vintage sunglass collector, and volunteer screen printing instructor at Discovery World, a hands on science museum.</p>
<p>I've been hard at work for the better part of the past year discovering a process that is successful in producing beautifully detailed, hand crafted wooden eye glasses that are unwilling to compromise form for the limitations of the material.  It took numerous failed attempts until I completed a pair that worked.  There’s still a small ways to go and always room for innovation, and I am excited for new breakthroughs and discoveries.</p>
<p>I use only Wisconsin sourced, sustainably grown and fallen urban lumber, carefully selected individually for its unique grain and figure for every pair made.  In addition to its beauty, the wood is chosen for its hardness, resiliance, and resistance to breaking or scratching. Proper Eyeglasses are one of a kind wearable works of art<br/>that are as strong as they are beautiful.</p>
<h3><strong>Immediate Goals</strong></h3>
<p>In addition to helping make Proper glasses available anywhere, supporting this project will allow me to produce hinges right here in Wisconsin, rather than China, that reinforce the strength of the temples and allow optometrists anywhere to adjust the glasses to any wearer.</p>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am working with a veterean optometrist of 48 years, Lupe Aguilar of Innovative Optique in Fox Point, WI, to make sure Proper glasses are of the highest quality and universally accepted by optometrists anywhere in the world.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to this project, you are helping me continue to develop a high quality product that is produced right in Milwaukee out of sustainable and gorgeous Wisconsin lumber.  Milwaukee has a long standing reputation of hard work and innovation and I believe this project follows that tradition.  I am fortunate to live in a place that grows some of the best wood in the world; in the words of Michael Green from his Ted Talk this year, <em>""Wood is the most technologically advanced material we can build with &amp; mother nature holds the patent.""</em></p>

<h3></h3>
<p>Last week, an Atlanta woman named <b>Gabrielle Mirville was arrested while topless in Woodruff Park. Her arrest, and subsequent jailing and fining, go against Georgia's laws which allow for women to go topless wherever it's okay for men to do so.</b></p>
<p>To read more about Gabrielle's story, Georgia's law, and the implications of this kind of discrimination, check out this article in Creative Loafing: <b><a href=""http://clatl.com/atlanta/right-to-bare-breasts/Content?oid=9000712"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://clatl.com/atlanta/right-to-bare-breasts/Content?oid=9000712</a></b></p>
<p>Gabrielle Mirville was a model in a photo shoot on the morning of August 4th. The shoot consisted mostly of the 24-year-old model standing alone against the early morning cityscape. The resulting photos are elegant, reverent portraits of both the model and the city.</p>
<p>A few of the shots required Mirville to be momentarily topless. This is where things got tricky. And Mirville got arrested.</p>
<p>Considering previous shoots that included nudity, Mirville says the team thought they had a good grasp of the law. On previous shoots in public places, Mirville claims, nearby APD officers had told them essentially ""do what you gotta do and don't be porny."" They quickly got the shots they needed, the project was tasteful and professional, and Mirville remained clothed except for the actual moment the photos were being taken.</p>
<p>On this morning, however, a bike cop felt differently. He arrested Mirville for public indecency. She subsequently spent nine hours in jail before being bailed out. At her Atlanta Municipal Court appearance the next morning, unaware of what constituted public indecency, she pled no contest.</p>
<p>""This was my first appearance so I hadn't been assigned a public defender or anything,"" Mirville told me. ""I wasn't sure what I should do. I was on my own. If I knew then what I know now about the law, there's no way I would've accepted any of that.""</p>
<p>By Mirville's account, Judge Terrinee Gundy allegedly wasn't interested in hearing her defense: ""When I tried to explain to the judge, she said, 'No, and next time maybe you'll learn to carry yourself like a lady.'""</p>
<p><b>Mirville had a choice: spend 10 days in jail or pay nearly $500 right then. Without anyone to counsel her on possible options, she paid up.</b></p>
<p><b>This campaign is to help raise money to cover her fines, and contribute to her legal fees as she challenges the ruling.</b></p>
<p>Your support is greatly appreciated!</p>

<h3>Your Money Makes Art Happen!</h3>
<p>It's almost time for Sideshow Crazy 8! A two-day festival of art and music that celebrates the local arts scene and is unique in Dayton for its variety, ambition, and all-volunteer grassroots energy. This year's Sideshow will feature a variety of artwork including paintings, photographs, sculptures and video installations from more than 50 artists as well as performances by over 20 musical acts. Admission is free, and open to everyone.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean The Sideshow is free to put on though <span>- this year we estimate operating costs to be approximately $5000, for items such as tents, sound pros &amp; equipment, required permits and much more - </span>and this is where we need your help. </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our campaign is only for $1500, less than a third of our estimated budget. If we exceed our goal (and we hope we will by a lot!) know that all the money will be used to make the Sideshow even better!</p>
</div>
<p>If you're an artist or musician that has participated in a past Sideshow, please donate! If you are friends with artists or musicians who have participated in a Sideshow, please donate! If you just like the idea of supporting a great art show or seeing cool things happen in Dayton, Ohio, please donate!</p>
<p>Any amount helps whether it is $5 or $500... think about it, where else will you get to see that amount of art and music for $5!</p>
<p>It's not just your money that makes art happen, your friend's money works too! Look at some of the big dollar perks we have and pool your money together to get them. Who wouldn't want a private rock show with 40 of your friends? Share this all over facebook and anywhere else that you can think of as well - the more it is out there, the better chance we have of exceeding our goal!</p>
<p>And keep checking back, we will be adding new perks through the month.</p>
<p>Most important, even if you can't afford to donate, make sure you come to The Sideshow on May 10 &amp; 11 at the Yellow Cab building (700 E. 4th St.) and see what gets created!</p>
<h3>Your Money Makes Art Happen!</h3>
<div>
<p>The Sideshow is magic - both for the people who participate and for those who attend. Built by artists just for the sheer fun of celebrating art and music, it is a unique show. This is our eighth year holding The Sideshow, and it is safe to say that hundreds of artists and musicians have added their talent and emotion to the Sideshow. For many it was their first time exhibiting or playing in front of a live audience. For others, it was a chance to experiment and try totally new things. You may have participated in past Sideshows yourself, and know the magic that we speak of... if not it is likely that you know at least one person, and more likely multiple people who have played a part in putting on the Sideshow. Your donations help make all this possible.</p>

<p>The Historic Warehouse Arts District in downtown Tucson is an eclectic, thriving and growing community. Citizens Warehouse, a cornerstone to this community, is home to 23 artists of varied mediums and disciplines. For the past few months we have been working on an art book featuring the artists of Citizens Warehouse.</p>
<h3>About the Book</h3>
<p>The primary purpose of the book is to support and give exposure to the artists in Citizens Warehouse.

The Historic Warehouse Arts District in downtown Tucson is an eclectic, thriving and growing community. Citizens Warehouse, a cornerstone to this community, is home to 23 artists of varied mediums and disciplines. For the past few months we have been working on an art book featuring the artists of Citizens Warehouse.
About the Book
The primary purpose of the book is to support and give exposure to the artists in Citizens Warehouse. It showcases select works from 20 artists, amounting to more than 120 full color images of paintings, drawings, sculpture, ceramics, metal work, furnishings, and multi-media art. There are also photographs to illustrate the culture of the warehouse from events, excursions and figure drawing sessions. It is a perfect bound, coffee table, art book measuring 8""x10"" closed with a soft cover, 104 pages in length.
The book also presents the stories of Bicycle Inter-Community Art and Salvage (BICAS) and its Art Annex, a historic essay about the warehouse—how it came to be what it is today, and more about the Tucson Historic Warehouse Arts District, Citizens Artist Collective (CAC) and Warehouse Arts Management Organization (WAMO).
Why a Book?
Citizens Warehouse, and spaces like it everywhere, is in danger of being lost, which would be a tremendous shame as the community of artists here would be displaced, as well as BICAS and their Art Annex. Currently, Citizens Warehouse offers affordable studio space (below market rate) to these artists which, if lost, would negatively impact the arts community—specifically, the Tucson Historic Warehouse Arts District.
So we want to spotlight this unique building and its artists with a beautiful art book. We think folks are really interested to know more about the inspired work that goes on in this concrete art bunker.
Book Sales
All money generated from the sales of this book after printing will be donated to funds for maintenance and repairs on the building, further marketing and promotion of the artists who work here, community programs such as field trips and workshops for students, and programs to help protect the warehouse—insuring it remain a vital part of the Arts District Community.

<p><em>“Behind the storm of daily conflict and crisis, the dramatic confrontations, the tumult of political struggle, the poet, the artist, the musician, continues the quiet work of centuries, building bridges of experience between peoples, reminding man of the universality of his feelings and desires and despairs, and reminding him that the forces that unite are deeper than those that </em></p>
<p><em>divide.”</em>                                                                                                         </p>
<p>John F. Kennendy </p>
<p>           Some days you wake up and put on clothing that came from China or Indonesia and was made by many different hands, and some days you wear something that is made of fine Italian silk, and some days it’s something that was formerly owned by a stranger.  It is unlikely that anyone wakes up and wears a garment that they made themselves in their own space, just the day before.  I want to know what this feels like and suffer all of the physical and emotional consequences.  I want to talk about this process and show that it is gratifyingly both simple and strenuous.</p>
<p>            I am an artist and designer living and working in New York City.  My practice circulates around utilizing everyday objects and materials to elevate our understanding of the creative process and accentuate the daily presence of the transcendent act of making.  I use fabric, clothing, food, and design as a way to engage the public and exemplify the unsung masterpieces inherent to our daily lives.   </p>
<p>            This project is important to me because a devotion to meaningful work promises to provide a space for meditational experience and the unmatched gratification that is derived from making something out of nothing.  For the past four months I have been engaging in a rigorous schedule commuting back and forth from New York to Boston each week in order to teach in several college programs.  This process has been physically, emotionally, and socially challenging, but has overall allowed me to recognize that repetitive, steady practice is absolutely necessary to my process.  Not able to maintain this regular practice has left me deeply desiring a regimented project in which my only task is to create every day.  This focus will inevitably lead to a higher understanding of myself and of the processes that I utilize in my work.  In addition to this personal experience that is necessary to my work right now, I feel that this performance accentuates the labor and material that is invested in the objects that we interact with very casually on a day-to-day basis.  I am requesting funding for this project so that I may embark on this journey without pressures to distract away from the experience and true and unadulterated focus.  The length of the project will be dictated by how much funding I receive through this platform and other sources.  The funds will be used for material (fabric, notions, and food stuffs for dinners), equipment, and rent.  If enough is raised, I would like to rent a space dedicated solely to this piece, a storefront would be ideal, allowing this process to be accessible to the public for the duration of the project . </p>
<p>            The proposed project, entitled Suit Yourself, is a publicly accessible, long-term, intensive performance with weekly craft-based workshops and culinary events.  The artist will design and construct each article of her clothing every day for at least one month but not to exceed one year.  No individual garment will be worn for more than one day, after which it will be catalogued and stored until the end of the performance.  The project is comprised of four major components:</p>
<ol>
<li>PERFORMANCE:</li>
</ol><ul>
<li>Craft-based, process-oriented performance in which the artist designs and constructs all items of clothing to be worn each day. </li>
<li>Concept circulates around production and practice of dressmaking and emphasizes material wastefulness and the disregard with which we treat most garments.</li>
<li>Sisyphean process (spending each day wearing what was made the day before while making the clothing to be worn the next day) is a metaphor for futility of repetitive, monotonous work while simultaneously exhibiting reverence for meaningful work and skillful practice.</li>
<li>Public hours will be available for visitors to come by and observe this work and talk to the artist about this experience.</li>
</ul><ol>
<li>DINNERS/WORKSHOPS:</li>
</ol><ul>
<li>Each week the artist will host and prepare a dinner for 10 participants who reserve a seat ahead of time.  The purpose of this gathering is to discuss the performance and the creative process involved in everyday activities such as dressing and cooking.</li>
<li>Each week the artist will run a workshop teaching simple skills involved in the performance (hemming pants, mending, altering, baking, pickling, etc) that accentuate the transcendent nature of unpacking habitual process and learning self-sufficiency.</li>
</ul><ol>
<li>DOCUMENTATION:</li>
</ol><ul>
<li>BLOG: each day the production will be carefully documented on a journalistic photo blog.</li>
<li>CATALOGUE: an image catalogue of each singular garment will be compiled at the end of the performance.</li>
<li>RECIPE BOOK: A book of the recipes prepared at the 24 meals will be created.</li>
</ul><ol>
<li>EXHIBITION:</li>
</ol><ul>
<li>The project will culminate in an exhibition of all garments created, exemplifying the scope of production. (180 bras, 180 undergarments, 180 outfits, etc.)</li>
</ul><p>         Though I have significant sewing experience, there will inevitably be frustration with certain items.  I recently executed a condensed version of this project at chashama266 in New York for three days.  I doing so, I was confronted with the task of constructing a brassiere for the first time, which ultimately proved to be very challenging.  By the third day I had improved significantly, but was by no means adept.  After ten months and the creation of approximately 300 bras alone, I will have found rhythm and ease with this process.  I am interested in the compulsive nature of honing physical skills through repetition.  I am eager to witness the psychological fallout, as I do believe it will be an overall enriching experience. Monotonous practice catalyzes inward reflection and amplifies the thought process as practice settles into a pattern-based flow.  </p>
<p>          This project examines the use of tangible skills pertaining to goods and services.  It analyzes the impulse to cover and decorate the body through a series of creative decisions based on social, cultural, and historical instincts and questions the classification of meaningful work and its ability to facilitate a transcendental experience.  I am interested in how we approach the act of adorning our bodies as a basic utilitarian need and as a vehicle for social or cultural expression.  Fashion articulates who we are—the intrinsic manifestation of art and life colliding.  I aim to accentuate the minute, creative ventures that happen everyday; the shape and palette of an outfit, flavor profiles of a meal, the composition of a room.  These unsung masterpieces are inadvertently similar to the artistic process.  I am interested in accessing this foundation of basic creative procedures as an impetus for dialogue and cooperation.  My work explores the inherent human visionary intuition.    </p>
<p>           Any support from donations received through Indiegogo will further this body of work by providing funding for equipment, materials, and space.  I have recently engaged in a studio-based graduate program, founded a communal gallery and studio space in Brooklyn, attended a studio residency in Boston MA, and taught at several colleges in the art and design programs.  This vested interest in community engagement in terms of education and public participation is at the heart of my career and my work.  It is pivotal to creation and existence of this work.  An opportunity that incorporates community discourse with making art would both shape my work and help me to extend this knowledge to my public.  It is these qualities, along with my experience in design and my education in New York City, that I am most proud of and have formed me into a valuable member of the arts community with an unmatched devotion to my practice.</p>
<p>           I truly thank each and every one of you in advance, for even reading this far and considering this project worth your time.  Please spread the word, far and wide, and help me to make this project a reality. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My dream is finally coming to fruition because of YOU!  My name is Katherine Nelson, and I am an art teacher at Warren T. White High School in Dallas.  The school was built in 1964, and although it is located in a beautiful area, we are a Title 1 school (underprivileged student body).  This year, we officially began a Fine Arts Academy and the administration has agreed to offer Ceramics next year, a program that will give our students the opportunity to express themselves through clay.    My school budget is dedicated to purchasing clay and other basic art supplies.  Here's where you come into the picture.  The only equipment we have is a small kiln.  We have absolutely NOTHING else needed for the program.  Some of the items needed to get a ceramics program started are expensive and will be used for many years by thousands of students; your gifts will outlive us all and continue serving our students.  It has always been a dream of mine to teach ceramics and I SO appreciate any help you can give!<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Ceramics is one of the very few subjects where everyone can succeed, regardless of socioeconomic status, physical, mental, or language limitations, or lack of previous education.  Many students who lack confidence refuse to try anything because they are afraid of failure - they choose to take a zero grade rather than face the possibility of failure on an assignment.  Once a student tastes success in any form, they are more willing to try harder in all their subjects.  This moves from school to real life situations.  I see a real and tangible opportunity to keep our kids off the streets and away from drugs.  Clay!   </span></h3>
<p>Every year, I have approximately 200 new art students.  The few times I have brought clay into the studio, every single kid was completely absorbed, looked forward to coming to class, and did not want to leave after the bell.  I have students coming into my room Mon.-Fri. beginning <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">at 7am</a>, during lunch, and staying after school until I kick them out <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">at 6:30pm</a>.  I LOVE my kids and with your help we can give them so much more!<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to finance $22,000 which will allow us to renovate an old mechanical room (my current art room) into a ceramics studio.  We need pottery wheels (I would like to start with 8), a slab roller, particle boards for wedging the clay, HardieBacker board to reclaiming clay, shelving to store the greenware, bisque, and current projects.  We need a pugger so none of our clay is wasted, and a clay sink so we don't ruin the plumbing.  We need sponges, mops, glazes, buckets, garbage cans, a hose, bats, extrusion dies, and CLAY!  As we receive donations, we will begin with the basic materials, then add the wheels and other goodies until we have the most spectacular studio in the area. We would love to thank you by making you a piece of pottery, so make sure we know who you are!!!</p>

What We Need & What You Get


Up to this point, due to lack of financial funding, we have only been able to create a photographic archive of the events.  Many times, particularly in the case of music and theatre, we felt this was not enough.

With more events already lined up we are increasingly feeling the need to start diffusing the unique artistic creations and exchanges that take place in this location via live stream around the world, and to build up a professional archive.

In order to do so, the ARTtractions Festival asks for your support in acquiring a semi-professional HD video camera for this purpose.   


Donors will be actively helping to preserve all the events that take place as part of the Festival, and for this reason will receive the gratitude of everyone involved in it, from volunteers and performers to the local community and wider internet audience, who will always have permanent records to look back on. You will be sent every spring a yearly Festival programme with details of live streaming performances, plus your name will be added to the book printed at the end of every Festival season.  In addition Palazzo Rinaldi Artists' Residency is also providing some perks to entice you further...

<p>In the spring of 2015, Emma Arrick, BRAT Production's 2014-15 Resident Artist will curate and direct Plant Me Here a multidisciplinary immersive experience based on the poetry of Philadelphia playwright Jason Rosenberg. Plant Me Here will be a culmination of a creative exploration conducted by artists from various disciplines, curated by Arrick, working as ensemble to interpret Rosenberg's poetry. Plant Me Here is an evening of sloppy magical realism that asks the viewer to vilify the body and find the beauty in horror. Plant Me Here is the result of open studio cross disciplinary collaboration. Right now it feels like when you put your hand in a bowl of spaghetti in a haunted house and for half a second you think that maybe it really is guts. Maybe later it will feel like something else. The piece is changing daily. </p>
<p><b>BRAT Productions’ Resident Artist Program</b></p>
<p>BRAT’s Resident Artist program was created to give emerging artists with bold and unapologetic visions the opportunity to produce original work. The Resident Artist program is unique in that gives an artist the opportunity to have both total creative ownership of an idea and access to BRAT’s years of producing experience to make that vision come to life. By offering the combination of creative ownership and producorial mentoring, BRAT is supporting the true “emerging artist,” and empowering the next generation of theater makers in Philadelphia.</p>

She is the co-founder of Cursed Church Art Collective, with whom she has played many roles including performer, stage manager, director, screenwriter, casting director and producer. Over the past several years Emma has allied herself with local experimental film company, Zimbo Films, Philadelphia based multi-disciplinary showcase series 5x7 Space Showing, BRAT Productions as well as individual artists spanning all mediums.

<p>Jason Rosenberg is playwright, poet, and actor based in Philadelphia. He is currently a senior at the University of the Arts with a focus in Playwriting. He is the co-founder and resident playwright for Cursed Church and the development intern for BRAT Productions. His writing asks, “How can we be happy if we’re going to die?” and explores this idea through the interplay of poetic visuals and sparse, emotionally disarming language. He hopes that through his work in Plant Me Here, he can contribute to the ongoing conversation about the relationship between playwrights and devised theater.</p>
<p><b>Cursed Mission Statement</b></p>
<p>The Cursed Church Artist Collective is a group of multidisciplinary artists dedicated to the creation of visceral, innovative works of theater and film and anything that can be loosely categorized within those perimeters. We are a group of young artists based in Philadelphia. Our artistic pursuits range from the staging of original poetic and movement centric theater to long form improv comedy to experimental filmmaking to rock musicals. Our aesthetic interests are always changing. When a member of our ensemble has an idea for a project they are interested in working on under the umbrella of our company, we make it happen. We have found that the best way to ask a question is shamelessly and the best way to answer it is with as many voices as possible. We are 8 people lucky enough to be surrounded by people who want to help us continue to do what we love. We are spooky and funny mostly.</p>

Involved in all forms of visual expression, including painting and sculpture, drawings, prints and illustrated books, photography, architecture and design, and film and video, as well as new forms yet to be developed or understood, that reflect and explore the artistic issues of this era. That these forms of visual expression are an open-ended series of arguments and counter arguments that can be explored through exhibitions and installations and are reflected in CuatroH. Also to affirm the importance of contemporary art and artists in Bushwick to remain vital and engaged with the present.
