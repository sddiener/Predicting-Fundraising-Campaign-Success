<li>Appreciative Inquiry</li>
<li>Trust Theory</li>
<li>Chaordic Design </li>
<li>Generative Dialogue </li>
<li>Adaptive Cycle </li>
<li>Enterprise Facilitation </li>
<li>Theory U </li>
<li>Process Oriented Psychology </li>
<li>Integral Theory </li>
<li>Conscious Co-Creation</li>
</ul><p>Each framework is summarized from the perspective of what is most useful in the field: the framework in a nutshell, its origin, a story of the framework in action, how it applies at the personal level (new!), finer points, possible pitfalls and finally key questions as a short cut to drawing out the insights of that framework. Icons support the reader to see connections between the different frameworks. </p><p>You can see a sample chapter <a href=""http://www.katersutherland.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Appreciative_Inquiry_Oc2.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p><p>The tools offer complementary perspectives and pointers, each focused on different aspects of how humans are together. Just as carpenters need hammers, screwdrivers, measuring tape, drills, sandpaper and so on, no one tool can do it all, but all together they support effective action. </p><h3>A toolkit to mobilize Barefoot Facilitators</h3><p>Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been inspired by the idea of Barefoot Doctors. In China in the mid-60s, there was little access to medical care in rural areas, and not enough resources to supply fully trained doctors. Instead, 30,000 villagers were trained in basic Western and Chinese medicine — enough to treat common ailments, and to share information about hygiene, family planning, and prevention of epidemics. Almost overnight, this important innovation revolutionized health outcomes in rural China.</p><p>By analogy, we do not have resources or capacity to supply professional facilitators to all the meetings and group endeavours supporting the great shifts underway. There are, however, thousands of people in all walks of life working to facilitate deep and lasting change in the human systems of which they are a part. </p><p><strong>This campaign is about giving tools to ""Barefoot Facilitators""</strong>, so people like you — embedded in meetings, teams, networks, companies and bureaucracies (along with families and communities) — have the confidence to intervene, and the capacity to do so effectively! </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496530297/qamxd1sa0fggb2rnccww.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>The book in action </h3><p>The first edition of the book, <i>Make Light Work in Groups: 10 Tools to Transform Meetings, Companies and Communities</i>,(2012), has been tried and tested:</p><ul>

Kate has brought the best of these together, in clear and direct language, making these processes easily accessible. Yet we must also notice how, in these past decades, we have become more separated, impatient and self-protective. Working well together is a much less frequent--even rare--experience as people withdraw in fear in response to profound uncertainty. This is where Kate's book becomes both a challenge and a gift. Can we commit to working in these ways so that people again become engaged with their work and manifest their collective creativity? If we do, people will remember the joy of what it feels like to work well together and produce work they believe in. And this is the ultimate gift.”</p><p>*****</p><p>Nina Simons, Co-Founder, Bioneers</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“This book is a rare gem, as it’s easily accessible, deeply useful and offers clear guidance to make changes that seem simple, but that will have profound effects, if practiced. Kate helps us to surface and make pragmatic what we intuitively know about groups and change processes. I urge you to see for yourself. It will strengthen your ability to navigate everything from relationships to complex systems, and to create the better outcomes we so need at this time.”</p><p>*****</p><p>Health Nexus </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“Open any page of this book and you will find practical ideas and strategies for working with groups — as a facilitator, participant or manager. We will definitely use and share these tools!”</p><p>*****</p><p>Alissa Hauser, Co-Founder, The Engage Network </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“Understanding group management theories as Kate lays out so simply and accessibly, is a huge benefit to anyone who relies on a group to get something done – whether it is a corporate team, a care circle that forms to take care of a sick friend, or a group of citizens who want to make their community stronger. I particularly love Kate’s personalized, narrative voice that makes it seem like she wrote the book just for me. The book is information-packed, yet an easy read at the same time. I will definitely integrate many of the models and theories Kate explains so eloquently into the groups I work with.”</p><p>*****</p><p>Susan Zielinski, Managing Director, SMART (Sustainable Mobility and Accessibility Research &amp; Transformation) University of Michigan </p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">“My work has to do with transforming transportation into something that helps us live more equitably and more sustainably on the planet. This gets a lot more complicated as the world urbanizes, demographics shift, climate change makes its presence known, the economy restructures, and a responsive flurry of new technologies and services and systems arrive on the scene faster than we can figure out how they all fit together and what might be their effects. Suddenly transportation is as much about working together, connecting the dots, collaborating on multi-faceted solutions across disciplines and sectors as it is about engineering and infrastructure. I think Kate’s book should be required reading at the very least for all transportation professionals if not for anyone who’s responsible for making our cities and communities better.”</p><h2> </h2><h2>About Kate &amp; the team</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495994322/tvo307fczbdoql8al7je.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>Kate Sutherland</h3><p>Kate Sutherland is founding faculty for Simon Fraser University’s Certificate in Social Innovation, and faculty and executive coach with THNK School of Creative Leadership.

What happens when we hit our crowdfunding goal? Once the book revisions are funded, then we can start to add video to our toolbox to help get these frameworks into the hands of more people for even greater impact. More about the bookWe Can Do This! introduces a complementary set of 10 frameworks, including: 
Appreciative Inquiry
Trust Theory
Chaordic Design 
Generative Dialogue 
Adaptive Cycle 
Enterprise Facilitation 
Theory U 
Process Oriented Psychology 
Integral Theory 
Conscious Co-Creation
Each framework is summarized from the perspective of what is most useful in the field: the framework in a nutshell, its origin, a story of the framework in action, how it applies at the personal level (new!), finer points, possible pitfalls and finally key questions as a short cut to drawing out the insights of that framework. Icons support the reader to see connections between the different frameworks. You can see a sample chapter here.The tools offer complementary perspectives and pointers, each focused on different aspects of how humans are together. Just as carpenters need hammers, screwdrivers, measuring tape, drills, sandpaper and so on, no one tool can do it all, but all together they support effective action. A toolkit to mobilize Barefoot FacilitatorsEver since I was a kid, I’ve been inspired by the idea of Barefoot Doctors. In China in the mid-60s, there was little access to medical care in rural areas, and not enough resources to supply fully trained doctors. Instead, 30,000 villagers were trained in basic Western and Chinese medicine — enough to treat common ailments, and to share information about hygiene, family planning, and prevention of epidemics. Almost overnight, this important innovation revolutionized health outcomes in rural China.By analogy, we do not have resources or capacity to supply professional facilitators to all the meetings and group endeavours supporting the great shifts underway. There are, however, thousands of people in all walks of life working to facilitate deep and lasting change in the human systems of which they are a part. This campaign is about giving tools to ""Barefoot Facilitators"", so people like you — embedded in meetings, teams, networks, companies and bureaucracies (along with families and communities) — have the confidence to intervene, and the capacity to do so effectively! The book in action The first edition of the book, Make Light Work in Groups: 10 Tools to Transform Meetings, Companies and Communities,(2012), has been tried and tested:
Core Text for the MA in Global Leadership at Royal Roads University, Canada and SFU's Certificate in Social Innovation. 
Required text for ""Creativity and Leadership in Groups” at Kwantlen Polytechnic University
Pivotal resource used to shift teams at BC's Provincial Health Services Authority from PowerPoints to participatory training sessions. 
Key resource for posAbilities' Building Caring Communities social innovation initiative for deepening the team’s ability to reflect on and articulate its practice. 
Recommended as required reading for 'every college and university"" by Ashoka Fellow Al Etmanski
TestimonialsMargaret Wheatley, author of many books, including Leadership and the New Science and most recently, Who Do We Choose To Be? “I've been very grateful for the many group processes developed in the past  decades that create new capacities and new relationships among people working together. Kate has brought the best of these together, in clear and direct language, making these processes easily accessible. Yet we must also notice how, in these past decades, we have become more separated, impatient and self-protective. Working well together is a much less frequent--even rare--experience as people withdraw in fear in response to profound uncertainty. This is where Kate's book becomes both a challenge and a gift. Can we commit to working in these ways so that people again become engaged with their work and manifest their collective creativity? If we do, people will remember the joy of what it feels like to work well together and produce work they believe in. And this is the ultimate gift.”*****Nina Simons, Co-Founder, Bioneers“This book is a rare gem, as it’s easily accessible, deeply useful and offers clear guidance to make changes that seem simple, but that will have profound effects, if practiced. Kate helps us to surface and make pragmatic what we intuitively know about groups and change processes. I urge you to see for yourself. It will strengthen your ability to navigate everything from relationships to complex systems, and to create the better outcomes we so need at this time.”*****Health Nexus “Open any page of this book and you will find practical ideas and strategies for working with groups — as a facilitator, participant or manager. We will definitely use and share these tools!”*****Alissa Hauser, Co-Founder, The Engage Network “Understanding group management theories as Kate lays out so simply and accessibly, is a huge benefit to anyone who relies on a group to get something done – whether it is a corporate team, a care circle that forms to take care of a sick friend, or a group of citizens who want to make their community stronger. I particularly love Kate’s personalized, narrative voice that makes it seem like she wrote the book just for me. The book is information-packed, yet an easy read at the same time. I will definitely integrate many of the models and theories Kate explains so eloquently into the groups I work with.”*****Susan Zielinski, Managing Director, SMART (Sustainable Mobility and Accessibility Research & Transformation) University of Michigan “My work has to do with transforming transportation into something that helps us live more equitably and more sustainably on the planet. This gets a lot more complicated as the world urbanizes, demographics shift, climate change makes its presence known, the economy restructures, and a responsive flurry of new technologies and services and systems arrive on the scene faster than we can figure out how they all fit together and what might be their effects. Suddenly transportation is as much about working together, connecting the dots, collaborating on multi-faceted solutions across disciplines and sectors as it is about engineering and infrastructure. I think Kate’s book should be required reading at the very least for all transportation professionals if not for anyone who’s responsible for making our cities and communities better.” About Kate & the teamKate SutherlandKate Sutherland is founding faculty for Simon Fraser University’s Certificate in Social Innovation, and faculty and executive coach with THNK School of Creative Leadership.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I have dreamed of being a novelist for YEARS. Ashes and Ice is based off of a character sketch I wrote when I was 12. After being introduced to the AMAZING Indie community, I published Ashes and Ice in February 2013. I was floored when within 24 hours of release, Ashes and Ice was on Three Top 100 Bestsellers Lists. Ashes and Ice was also voted #1 for Best YA Book Cover of 2013. I was so grateful to all the bloggers and readers who helped to make Ashes and Ice so successful. </p>

<h3><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get:</b></h3>
<b>So, why do I need your help?</b><p></p>
<p>Well, after a lot of thought and consideration I decided I wanted to release an extended edition of Ashes and Ice to my readers. I have been in contact with two incredible actors who are willing to be narration for the Ashes and Ice audiobook AND I am antsy to release the sequel to Ashes and Ice! All this awesomeness takes moolah. If I waited till I had this amount of money to invest in this series it may take me well into 2014 or even 2015 to pull the cash together and I would LOVE to get this series done and published way before then. THAT is where you come in!</p>
<p>Where is the money going?</p>
<ul>
<li>$700 for editing and marketing costs for the re-release of the extended edition of Ashes and Ice</li>
<li>$2000 for producing, releasing, and marketing the Ashes and Ice Audiobook</li>
<li>$4000 for editing, formatting, cover design, and marketing for Book 2</li>
<li>$1300 for a print run for 250 Books</li>
<li>STRETCH GOAL! (Total of 12k) $4000 for editing, formatting, cover design, and marketing for Book 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Every single dollar gets me (and this series) a step closer to this $8k (or 12k stretch) goal. I know how phenomenal the Indie Book community is and have faith that we can get this project off the ground. I also know that you gorgeous donators deserve PRIZES! What kind of prizes are we talking about??</p>

A Teaser:



Many more Ashes and Ice teasers on my Facebook Author Page!

What I Need & What You Get:
So, why do I need your help?
Well, after a lot of thought and consideration I decided I wanted to release an extended edition of Ashes and Ice to my readers. I have been in contact with two incredible actors who are willing to be narration for the Ashes and Ice audiobook AND I am antsy to release the sequel to Ashes and Ice! All this awesomeness takes moolah. If I waited till I had this amount of money to invest in this series it may take me well into 2014 or even 2015 to pull the cash together and I would LOVE to get this series done and published way before then. THAT is where you come in!
Where is the money going?

$700 for editing and marketing costs for the re-release of the extended edition of Ashes and Ice
$2000 for producing, releasing, and marketing the Ashes and Ice Audiobook
$4000 for editing, formatting, cover design, and marketing for Book 2
$1300 for a print run for 250 Books
STRETCH GOAL! (Total of 12k) $4000 for editing, formatting, cover design, and marketing for Book 3

Every single dollar gets me (and this series) a step closer to this $8k (or 12k stretch) goal. I know how phenomenal the Indie Book community is and have faith that we can get this project off the ground. I also know that you gorgeous donators deserve PRIZES! What kind of prizes are we talking about??
Here's a snapshot of the hotness coming your way:





Ebooks, signed paperbacks, and signed hardbacks!
Bookmarks, posters, postcards, bookplates!
Beta-reads, critiques!
Deleted scenes, teasers, sneak peaks, POV scenes! 
Sexy fishnet stockings, boots, and apparel!
Shout outs/chats/autographs from Character-Look-A-Like Models!
AND MORE! Oh, and prepare for an awesome party during the campaign AND another HUUUUGE party for the Release! 


Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:

Share the campaign via Facebook, Twitter, Blogs, ANYWHERE and enter to win prizes.
Have you read Ashes and Ice? Did you love it? If so, if you could consider doing a video review and submitting the link to me via my contact page on www.rochellemayacallen.com OR Facebook page!
Become a member of my street team and help get the campaign and Ashes and Ice as much publicity as possible!


My Promise:
If I can get my STRETCH GOAL of $12k fully funded, I will publish the whole Trilogy by April 2014!
Yeah, that freaks me out a little bit, but if you believe in me enough to get me to my goal then I will work my ass off to get you this story AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. 
Wow, here we go!
I am so freakin' excited that I am practically doing cartwheels in my living room. I HEART all of you and I am sending you all a gigantic cyber hug!




Now just a CUTE photo from a reader to put a smile on your face :)
Happy reading and *ehem* donating.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

While undoubtedly we love the work we publish, and the voices to which we lend a platform; and, while we're sure that the hours upon hours of grunt-work we perform each week are, in a sense, their own reward; yet, despite all of that, we are living in a state of relative poverty, and require some manner of assistance from our beloved and be-loving readers and readers-to-be.  Furthermore, we don't particularly want to monetize as we feel it would detract from the aesthetic uniformity and not-suckiness of the site.<br/></span></span> <br/><div>

In two years of existence we've published the work of 200+ established and emergent, fringe-dwelling, dazed, confused, unscrubbed, slightly unbalanced, cuddly, lovable literary voices, but all thoroughly and unusually brilliant. In that time, 'SB' has grown into a community, as well as a periodical: its unique cross-platform ethos and approach facilitating the free exchange of ideas, discussions, criticisms, and feedback; in addition to being a home for great works of emergent literature, we are also something of a school: for writers, for written works, for ideas; a visionary space wherein readers, editors and contributors alike may brainstorm ideas, develop, experiment with, hone and refine their respective crafts. While undoubtedly we love the work we publish, and the voices to which we lend a platform; and, while we're sure that the hours upon hours of grunt-work we perform each week are, in a sense, their own reward; yet, despite all of that, we are living in a state of relative poverty, and require some manner of assistance from our beloved and be-loving readers and readers-to-be.  Furthermore, we don't particularly want to monetize as we feel it would detract from the aesthetic uniformity and not-suckiness of the site.

<p><b>Just a Little About the Start of This Campaign </b></p>
<p>Hello, and thank you for stopping by my campaign! I hope that after you read
this information you will share my enthusiasm about the potential of this
campaign! </p>
<p>My name is Tiffany Bennett, and I am currently a student at West Virginia
University studying Child Development and Family Studies. I will graduate this May, and then I will go to grad school to get my Masters in Preschool Special Needs. In my free time I
enjoy writing children’s books. Currently, I am working on the publication for
my first book, Fred Fishy, M.D. Fred Fishy, M.D. is a doctor that is a fish. In
this first book, it describes what his job is all about, and how he has helped
the community. From then on, the books will be focused around a sea creature
that has a disability. Fred Fishy, M.D. will be a secondary character that helps the
sea creature overcome his/her disability. </p>
<p><b>Help Provide Support to the Children </b></p>
<p>With the publication of this series of books, children that have a
disability will be able to have a book that relates to them. This book series will provide support to children with
disabilities, and it will give them a book that they can relate to. This book
series will not just be for disabled children, however, it will be beneficial
to children without a disability, as well. It will introduce them to the
differences that each person has, and it will help to teach them acceptance of
these disabilities. </p>
<p><b>What Your Support Will Provide </b></p>
<p>All of the funding will go towards the publication of this book series. The
publishing package that I have chosen costs $3,999 for the first book. With my
goal of raising $4,800, I will be able to pay for the publication package, pay
the fees to Indiegogo and purchase copies that I will pass out at children’s
hospitals and signing events. </p>
<p>If I am not able to reach this goal, I will drop down the publication
package to a package that does not include hardcover copies or promotional
materials (bookmarks, fliers, and postcards).</p>
<p>If I receive more contributions than my goal amount, those funds will go
towards the publication fees of the following books in this series. </p>
<p>These children’s books will rhyme, and each the story will be about 10 pages
long. This length is shown to be great for children in preschool, and kindergarten. Books for this age group are very popular, and sell great.
Also, books for children with special needs and disabilities are also in high
demand. </p>
<p>I hope you all are as excited about this campaign as I am! If you are able
to give a donation to this cause, every donation will help! If you are not able
to give money as a donation, there are still ways you can help this cause!
Share it with your friends, and they can share it with their friends! I truly
appreciate any type of help you are able to give! </p>
<p>Thank you all so much for your interest in this campaign! I hope that you

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <p>This eBook will help you ""boil down"" the corporate-speak and walk you through creating a strategic plan that is relevant to your one-person creative business, whether you sell on Etsy or any other online marketplace, set up a booth at craft fairs and other events, wholesale your products to gift shops, or any combination thereof.  While this is geared toward handmade goods artists, I believe the concepts will work for any kind of creative solopreneur, including fine artists, writers, and other freelancers.</p>
<h3>What Is Strategic Planning and Why Do You Need It?</h3> <p>One of the best definitions I found of the strategic planning process describes it as making the big decisions that guide the destiny of your business.  It's a process of figuring out the <i>whys</i> of your business, the core values and reasons it exists.  You paint the big picture of your business dreams and then work backwards to create a plan to make it come true.</p>
<p>So why does a solo artist need a strategic plan?  First of all, if you want your business to be a business, you have to treat it as a business.  And if you want your business to grow, you have to set goals and take actions to achieve them.  Strategic planning helps you direct those goals and make business decisions faster.  For example, when you're deciding if you should make a new product, start selling through a new venue, advertise on a certain website, etc. you can look at the decision through the frame of your strategic plan.  If it fits with your whys, you probably want to go for it.  But if it doesn't, you should probably steer clear.</p>
<p>Strategic planning is also a great reminder of why you decided to make a business out of your art.  It's easy to feel like throwing in the towel when you're short on inspiration and not making sales, but with a strategic plan you'll be able to look past your present issues and see how your future vision is still on track (or just needs a bit of tweaking).</p> </div> <div> <h3>Why Should You Listen To Me?</h3> <p>The idea for the eBook came while I was working on my Capstone project for my Bachelor's degree in E-Commerce and Internet Marketing.  My degree was designed through individualized studies, and throughout my education I focused on how I could translate the ""big business"" concepts I was learning to apply to my own very small business designing jewelry and accessories and selling them online and at events.  My project involved creating a strategic plan for my business, and I was continually frustrated by the lack of relevant information available for very small businesses.  I spent three months digging into corporate strategic planning and figuring out how to reframe it into something that made sense for my business.</p>
<p>My final paper (for which I received an A+ grade) had the following sections:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Strategic Planning (an overview and why very small businesses should do it)</li>
<li>Competencies and Capabilities (what you need to be, do, and have)</li>
<li>Defining Success </li>
<li>Case Studies of Micro-Businesses</li>
<li>Developing the Strategic Plan</li>
</ul>
<div>While I won't bore you with the over-analysis of every article I read, I will be using this framework and all the research I've done (and continue to do) as I write this book.  In addition, I have started a group on Facebook with a variety of my friends who are small business owners, writers, artists, and freelancers.  Their feedback and suggestions so far have already shown me that the scope of this book may need to be expanded to include other types of planning, which I consider ""next step"" plans once you've determined your strategic plan.  These include Operational Planning, Financial Planning, Marketing/Sales Planning, Product Development Planning, Contingency/Continuity Planning, Sustainability/Social Responsibility Planning, Growth Planning, and Human Resource/Succession Planning.  Put these all together, and you will have the Ultimate Business Plan.</div>
<div>If you would like an invite to the group, please let me know. :)</div>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What's In It For You?</h3> <p>This campaign is for pre-orders of the eBook I am working on.  By offering it through IndieGoGo before I've completed it, I'm giving you a chance to get it at a steep discount, as well as have a say in what gets included in the final draft.  You'll have an opportunity to ask me questions about strategic planning and make suggestions that are relevant to your business.</p>
<p>Everyone who makes a contribution will receive a personal email from me.  Besides thanking you, I will also ask you to respond to that email with any of your questions and suggestions.  You can even make suggestions on what my next book should be about!</p>
<p>The first 100 people to pre-order the eBook will get it for only $5.  Everyone after that will get it for $10, which is still more than half off the planned regular price of $25.  </p>
<p>In addition, I have designed other perks to help YOU with YOUR business.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>For $25, you will receive weekly emailed updates from me as I work on the book and use it to create my own strategic plan.  Follow along with what I'm doing and apply the concepts to your own business.  Of course, you'll also get a copy of the completed eBook.</li>
<li>For $50, your ""business card"" will be included in the back of the book.  You will have a business card sized space to advertise your business and contact info.  You will also receive the weekly emailed updates and the completed eBook.</li>
<li>For $100, you will be featured on my blog, either as a ""Share Your Story"" article that you write, or one that I write after interviewing you (via email).  The business card ad, email updates, and completed eBook are also included in this perk.</li>
<li>For $250, you will get to have a brainstorming session with me via Skype or chat.  We will talk about your business, your dreams, and get you started on creating your own strategic plan.  You will also be featured on my blog (I can interview you during the brainstorming session, or give you ideas for writing your own article), and you will receive the business card ad, email updates, and completed eBook.</li>
<li>For $500, I will walk you through creating your own strategic plan.  This will be done mostly via email, with the occasional Skype or chat as necessary.  The blog feature, business card ad, email updates, and completed eBook are also included.</li>
<li>For $1000, we will ""meet"" once a week for a year online (via Skype or chat) to work on your own strategic plan and put it into motion.  The blog feature, business card ad, email updates, and completed eBook will also be included.</li>
<li>For $5000, I will come to you and work with you on your strategic plan in person for up to one week.  This price should cover airfare and hotel accommodations for me.  I will also continue to meet with you online for a year.  And you will receive the blog feature, business card ad, email updates, and completed eBook.</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The past year has been very challenging for me, with both my husband and myself having health issues.  I had to shut down my Etsy shop because I wasn't able to get orders out in a timely fashion.  Thankfully, we are doing better, and while we are by no means ""cured,"" we have become more accustomed to our ""new normal.""  </p>
<p>Writing is something I think I can do even when I'm not feeling well enough to do anything else.  It doesn't require me to put on pants (pants are evil) and go to the post office, at least!  And by offering the weekly emailed updates, I am holding myself accountable to continually making progress.  I am also going to take a page out of NaNoWriMo and commit to working on the book every day in November and using the update feature here to report my daily word count.</p>
<p>I have set my goal very low, as I am planning to write this book regardless.  Once I reach the first $500, I will be adding another type of planning for each additional $500 raised.</p>
<p></p>

<li>$4000 = Growth Planning</li>
<li>$4500 = Human Resources/Succession Planning</li>
<li>$5000 = Putting Together Your Ultimate Business Plan</li>
</ul>
<div><b>Each of these will be a separate book, and normally sold individually for $25 each, but you can get them ALL for as little as $5 by supporting this campaign and preordering!</b></div>
<p>I have several other ""stretch"" goals in mind, including audio and print versions of the book, companion workbooks and/or journals, additional reports on related topics, a private forum where you can discuss your plans and businesses with other contributors, and a few other ideas I'll keep a surprise for now.  :)</p>

called her over with a look of desperation. The waitress walked over and said,
“I hate to interrupt what looks like an intense conversation, but I wanted to
know if you wanted anything else before I leave.” I said, “We are set, can I
just grab the check.” The waitress and I looked at each other and smirked. This
didn’t go unnoticed by my date, who angrily said, “I can’t believe you are
flirting right in the middle of our date.” She was clearly upset and told me,
“I have no time for people who play games.” I had a completely reactionary
response, so without thinking I blurted out, “Well, you’d have more time if you
stopped talking so much.” That did it, a switch flipped in her head and I could
see the rage in her eyes. Her face wrinkled like a prune and I knew it was
going to get ugly. She grabbed the glass of water and gave what had to be the
worst attempt in the history of throwing a drink in someone’s face. Not only
did every drop of water miss me, but the glass also slipped out of her hand and
was launched into the side of a fish tank. I stared at her in complete
disbelief as she ran out of the bar muttering to herself. I couldn’t help but
think, “She’s still talking, unbelievable!” </i></p>

These fools are gonna distribute the fuck out of some words and word related paraphernalia. Let’s set minds on fire, not books.""  -The Gap-Toothed MadnessObtaining the necessary funds (the ugly part of art)I am busting my body working 40-60 hours a week, selling my possessions, and doing jobs for the weird Craigslist folks.  Anything I can to add flesh to Books & Shovels I am doing.  We are preparing to hit the road at the 2014 NYC Poetry Festival (July 26th to 27th), and do not have enough time to sacrifice our eating habits and pockets for this mission.  We're setting up the speakers, but need your voice to help amplify the collective scream.  Your pledges will be the necessary vocal cords we cannot strum on our own.   Every pledge we receive is entitled to one of the wonderful rewards we've set up for you to show our appreciation of your assistance. What is the money going towards?All pledged / raised funds will help cover:
Emergency car repair 
Wire racks 
Book printing
Distribution 
Banners 
Venue / tour space 
Hosting open mics
Vendor tables at festivals 
Decals 
Distributing your books / cds / art
We have the bones. We have the art, the joy, the love, the fear, and now it's time to split lightening in two.Given the chance, we will split lightening in two. How will you be distributing?When Books & Shovels is in operation, we will be busking (i.e. street performing) in front of a station-wagon-turned-bookstore overflowing with books and art.  Everything will be presented on a fold-out table and on collapsible bookshelves.  We will have this set up on your local street corners, outside open mics and slams, at festivals, and anywhere we can bleed openly.  O, and rogue open mics are a thing.  Nostrovia! Poetry and UndergroundBooks hosted D.I.Y. open mics at the 2013 NYC Poetry Festival, and the same concept will be applied to wherever shop opens.  We'll slightly touch upon acting as a mobile venue through this process.  What will you be distributing?
Chapbooks
Street Books
Novels 
Cook Books
Comics
Zines
Broadsides
Paintings & Drawings
CDs / Records
Stickers & Graffiti 
& any physical example of passionate living
If you would like to have your art distributed through Books & Shovels, please contact us through the Books & Shovels website.YOUR REWARDSAlong with the good karma that comes with all our rewards, we'll give you accreditation for your assistance on the Books & Shovels website.  Some rewards are IndieGoGo exclusive, and will never be available again (the kiss is always available). Some of the rewards include working with you on a poem, private ciphers, Books & Shovels coming to your town, ghost written love poems, book reviews, and other fun jazz.  Look to the right hand side bar to see your rewards for supporting us.WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU OVER SHOOT?Pending on pledgers and how much we over shoot our fundraising goal, we can afford to give back to the community, and purchase publications from wonderful indie presses such as 48th Street Press, Lazy Fascist, Black Balloon Publishing, Tiny Hardcore Press, Horror Sleaze Trash, and Blood Pudding Press. With excess pledges, we will financially give back to the artistic community.WHEN WILL YOU BEGIN TRAVELING?Nostrovia! Poetry and UndergroundBooks are featured performance sets and vendors at the 2014 NYC Poetry Festival at Governor's Island.  After the festival finished on July 29th, we hit the road.
""At the ripe age of 19, Jeremiah Walton will challenge the latent ageism in you when you realize all that he’s accomplished thus far."" -Effie StarWHERE ARE YOU GOING?All of the cities below, and every where in between.  We are not making a concrete schedule or plan regarding locations (except for those who pledge 500+ dollars, with whom we'll be meeting up and getting involved in their area).  We aren't planning concretely due to the nature of the road: it beats the hell out of you and doesn't care where you're headed.

PLEDGE TO FIGHT APATHY & SET FIRE TO THE GASOLINE THAT IS BOOKS & SHOVELS.
 ""Nostrovia Poetry is a bomb. In two years that I know Jeremiah Walton he grew his underground guerrilla publishing empire to ten times its size. There is no money in poetry, and no poetry in money, and in particular there is zero money in independent poetry… But somehow, when a person is passionate things work out. Nostrovia! gets it done. If we all help–a little, by donating a chap-book, a dollar or just sharing this–there will be a new, mobile small press book store on the roads of America.

<br/>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I'm Jody Medland and I am a professional writer who is equally as passionate about books as I am about film.</p>

Ten e-books and over 3,000 downloads later, we have established a great readership community and are now gearing up for the launch of our first paperback book, <i>The Moors</i>.<br/><br/><p>This project is hugely important to myself as a writer and the company as a whole because it will help us deliver content to more readers and subsequently build our fanbase for all future releases.  <br/></p>
<b>Mission statement</b><br/>To seek, educate and nurture talent in both literature and screenwriting, creating and publishing original works that will challenge and alter people’s perceptions of the world.<br/><br/>The mission starts now and by contributing to the project, you can help make it happen.<br/>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>For the past 9-months myself, digital content manager Michael Pengelly, graphic designer Paul Newsome and proofreader/photographer Prima Patel have been working hard to get <i>The Moors</i> ready for the marketplace. </p>
<p>We are very nearly ready, but there is still a great deal of effort needed in regards to designs (for posters, special edition book covers, etc) and marketing (arranging radio spots, magazine column inches, online interviews, etc).</p>
<p>We are currently £3,000 short of what's needed to give the book the best possible chance of commercial success. In the instance we don't quite reach our goal, we have many plan B scenarious set up, so your money won't be wasted. However, it will mean less slots on the radio to smaller audiences and more sporadic news coverage when the book is actually released.<br/></p>

Short Summary Hi there!
I'm Jody Medland and I am a professional writer who is equally as passionate about books as I am about film.

Pen Works Media was formed in 2011 with the intention of finding original stories and bringing them to modern readers. Ten e-books and over 3,000 downloads later, we have established a great readership community and are now gearing up for the launch of our first paperback book, The Moors.This project is hugely important to myself as a writer and the company as a whole because it will help us deliver content to more readers and subsequently build our fanbase for all future releases.  
Mission statementTo seek, educate and nurture talent in both literature and screenwriting, creating and publishing original works that will challenge and alter people’s perceptions of the world.The mission starts now and by contributing to the project, you can help make it happen.
  
What We Need & What You Get For the past 9-months myself, digital content manager Michael Pengelly, graphic designer Paul Newsome and proofreader/photographer Prima Patel have been working hard to get The Moors ready for the marketplace. 
We are very nearly ready, but there is still a great deal of effort needed in regards to designs (for posters, special edition book covers, etc) and marketing (arranging radio spots, magazine column inches, online interviews, etc).
We are currently £3,000 short of what's needed to give the book the best possible chance of commercial success. In the instance we don't quite reach our goal, we have many plan B scenarious set up, so your money won't be wasted. However, it will mean less slots on the radio to smaller audiences and more sporadic news coverage when the book is actually released.
We have spent time looking at what people like to receive in return for financial contributions. It seems that people enjoy tangible rewards that they get to hold and, more importantly, are able to use. Therefore, we have taken care to create things that: 

Connect you to the project

Provide you with collector's items
Make you a part of our community

Associate you with a growing company

We have created things such as a pack of Top Trumps based on the book's characters, special edition posters and book covers that very few people in the world will own. What's more, for every supporter that purchases The Moors, 5% of the sale will be donated to Barnardo's, who have partnered with us for the launch, so not only can you contribute to a cool project and get some great souvenirs, but you can help unfortunate children towards a brighter future in the process. 

Remember, it's not just The Moors that will benefit from your contributions but all books created by Pen Works Media in the future.Note: It has been known for some backers to prefer the entirety of their contribution to be used for the cause. If you would rather we use all of your money for the campaign as opposed to dedicating a percentage of it towards your gifts, simply let me know via e-mail once you have pledged.


About The Moors

Book Blurb
                     The call was disturbing, but as far as
investigatory                           journalist Amanda Connors was concerned, it
had to be fate.
            Inadvertently, it was the years of abuse during her childhood            that led her into journalism and to now receive an anonymous         tip-off claiming negligence within a
children’s care home offered                             the chance to finally put the past behind
her. 
       It was the winter of 1972 when she journeyed
from London to Devon                to pursue the lead, though she would only learn one thing.
                                    Some secrets are better left
buried.

<p>An easy task this will not be - countless ideas and recipes have come across our desk in the last two years - all worthy to appear in this jaffle bible.

An easy task this will not be - countless ideas and recipes have come across our desk in the last two years - all worthy to appear in this jaffle bible. Sadly, we cant include everything, so we must choose the absolute cream of the crop, the jewels in the crown, the clutch players in the final 5 seconds. The most delicious, tasty, amazing recipes is what we're after and we need you to help us achieve this mountainous task.

What We Need & What You Get

The Big Breakfast boffins have crunched the numbers and the results are in. To recreate all recipes, photograph each toasty treasure, produce the book and provide the perks we need the princely sum of $7800. 
To achieve this royal figure we have come up with some perks for our loyal #TST disciples. Help us achieve this sum and you will be regally rewarded with gifts that range from your name chronicled in this historic book - to full blown naming rights on-air.
This is the opportunity to have YOUR favorite recipe gracing the pages! When all is said and done, Robbie and Adam believe they owe it to toasted sandwich lovers everywhere to make this happen. Lets be honest - if you love #TST then deep down you already know that you owe it to YOURSELF to be involved!!  

Other Ways You Can Help

Not everyone can afford to help in monetary terms - we totally understand. But hey, you can help in other ways! Please by all means share our journey. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Blogging - please just share, share, share the TST movement!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

My name is Kofi Opam,
and I'm a 24-year old writer. I was born and raised in New York City (Queens, to be exact #LETSGOMETS), and I have been writing since I was a Lisa Frank diary-loving little kid. I am a cat dad, a lover of bad TV, and the child of Haitian and Ghanaian immigrants.




(My parents and grandmother)
My writing has been published in The Gallatin Review, The Atlas Review, and with the Undiscovered Countries arts festival, and I've won several awards for my work, including the Herbert Rubin Prize for excellence in prose.
I am raising money to help cover the tuition, lodging, and travel costs to attend the 17th annual Voices of Our Nations Arts Workshop at the University of Miami. The VONA Workshop is the country's only multi-genre writing workshop for writers of color, and I just found out that I was selected to participate! 
Going to VONA means the world to me. As a transgender black man, particularly one who is a first-generation immigrant, voices like mine have never really felt supported in conversations about writing - in previous classes we read a lot of Fitzgerald and Hemingway and not a lot of Morrison or Baldwin. This will be my first writing workshop, and my hope is that VONA, as a safe space for writers of color, will give me the opportunity to focus on my writing in an encouraging environment with people of similar experiences! 


(Pictured: photos from VONA workshops, in all of their glory.)
I first heard of the workshop through the work of Dominican author Junot Díaz, one of VONA's original founders. I'm borderline compulsive when it comes to reading everything that Díaz has ever touched - from his short story collections to The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao - because his characters and his writing voice taught me more about myself and my own history than I ever learned in mainstream English classes. The way he writes about Hispañiola, its people and its mythologies and its pain, all ring true for me. 
On top of that, the fact that Díaz received a Pulitzer Prize for a book about a Dominican ghetto-nerd raised a mirror to my own dreams, kind of like: you can do this too, cabrón. 
And now I have the chance to study at the writing workshop that he founded!

All of the money I raise will go towards my tuition and travel fund, and any additional funds will go to Indiegogo fees ($50-$150) and the income I will lose from taking off from work to attend.

Since 2011, we've featured more than 40 poets and writers from across the U.S. and offered over 21 free writing workshops. </p><p>My name is ire'ne lara silva. My brother and I are the co-coordinators for the Flor De Nopal Literary Festival. Our dream has been to open up a space for the creation of new literary/writing/creative communities. In the past few years, we have seen these communities take root and grow. For the future, we imagine strengthening and expanding what we have already begun.</p><p>The Flor de Nopal Literary Festival’s mission is to promote the literary work of emerging and established Mexican-American/Latin@ poets and writers, to create and nourish ties between Mexican-American/Latin@ writers and writers of other<br/>races and ethnicities, and to offer writing workshops not only of interest to other <br/>writers but to diverse communities.</p><p>Unfortunately, this year, many of our funding sources suffered budgetary cuts and we have not been able to raise the funds we need to complete our 2013 programming. </p><p>Currently, we need to raise a total of  $2000 for Flor De Nopal and for Red Salmon Arts' SOY (Save Our Youth) Program...Red Salmon Arts was founded by the late poet raul r. salinas and is the non-profit umbrella for Flor De Nopal.</p><p>$1100 to fund honoraria for the writers which will be featured on December 6, 2013. Many of these writers have already been involved with Flor De Nopal by offering free writing workshops to the community.</p><p>$200 to cover costs of gifts + shipping/handling for donors.</p><p>$700 to fund Red Salmon Arts as it re-launches its efforts with the SOY (Save Our Youth) Program.</p><p>Any funds raised over the target amount will benefit Red Salmon Arts/SOY Program. If we do not reach our target amount, honoraria, gifts, and RSA/SOY's funding will be proportionately reduced.

Since 2011, we've featured more than 40 poets and writers from across the U.S. and offered over 21 free writing workshops. My name is ire'ne lara silva. My brother and I are the co-coordinators for the Flor De Nopal Literary Festival. Our dream has been to open up a space for the creation of new literary/writing/creative communities. In the past few years, we have seen these communities take root and grow. For the future, we imagine strengthening and expanding what we have already begun.The Flor de Nopal Literary Festival’s mission is to promote the literary work of emerging and established Mexican-American/Latin@ poets and writers, to create and nourish ties between Mexican-American/Latin@ writers and writers of otherraces and ethnicities, and to offer writing workshops not only of interest to other writers but to diverse communities.Unfortunately, this year, many of our funding sources suffered budgetary cuts and we have not been able to raise the funds we need to complete our 2013 programming. Currently, we need to raise a total of  $2000 for Flor De Nopal and for Red Salmon Arts' SOY (Save Our Youth) Program...Red Salmon Arts was founded by the late poet raul r. salinas and is the non-profit umbrella for Flor De Nopal.$1100 to fund honoraria for the writers which will be featured on December 6, 2013. Many of these writers have already been involved with Flor De Nopal by offering free writing workshops to the community.$200 to cover costs of gifts + shipping/handling for donors.$700 to fund Red Salmon Arts as it re-launches its efforts with the SOY (Save Our Youth) Program.Any funds raised over the target amount will benefit Red Salmon Arts/SOY Program. If we do not reach our target amount, honoraria, gifts, and RSA/SOY's funding will be proportionately reduced. (For example, if we raise only $1000, $550 will go to honoraria, $100 to gifts, and $350 to RSA/SOY).All donations are tax-deductible contributions. All donations made during this campaign are tax-deductible for 2013.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Nowadays, you read about a ""crazy person"" shooting someone and then themselves on the news all too often.  There's usually a manifesto, but who gets to read it?  This book is about a Bipolar Woman's healing, and provides a look into the mind of what some may label as a ""crazy person.""  It is a perspective lacking in our society, and one which will greatly contribute to understanding. </p>
<p>As to the story, come giggle and be shocked as you discover great truths about humankind in the time loop, while watching a pot-smoking Telepath find herself in the Snowden exposed Honey Trap in the USA, and on her way to spiritual redemption!!  In addition, it details persecution during out times in the USA, and forgiveness.</p>

<p>Most people don’t realize just how forgiving God is; there
is very little you can do that hasn’t been already done by someone else in time
and that hasn’t already been forgiven. 
This book will entertain you not only with an impossibly naïve,
irrational and immature perspective which you will watch develop right under
your eyes as the Lord transforms the subject, or “molds the vase,” into a
maturity level fit for the revelation of some Biblical mysteries that you'll find to be amazing!  <br/></p>

It came to me in a dream on the afternoon of June 13th, 1996. I ran downstairs to write is as a short story before I forgot it. It then became a screenplay called 'Blood' that finished in the top 10% of the Expo 4 contest out of 2,500 entrants (see here; http://messageboard.donedealpro.com/boards/showthread.php?t=14249)
Now I am about to launch The Vorbing on an unsuspecting public as a novel. I will withhold the title until publication, you'll see why. Self-publishing is a fantastic way to get your work out there with no barriers.   What I Need & What You Get I need approximately €1000 to get my book cover designed, have my manuscript formatted into all the various formats for eBook and print, get all the ISBN numbers necessary and get a print run done (I'm sure there will be more costs down the line). Regardless of whether I reach the full amount I am seeking, I will utilise every cent raised to get my book out there.

Heather Fowler’s fourth collection of fiction speaks the language of need. Desperate, obsessive, even demented need—both emotional and erotic—is voiced by characters ill or ill-advised. From cyber to stalker, illicit, explicit, tender and tedious, the relationships in
<i>Elegantly Naked In My Sexy Mental Illness</i>
translate love and lust into disorder. How we hear our own need and the way it sounds to others proves in these enthralling stories an imperfect but utterly captivating conversation, a destructive yet dynamic discourse between well-being and disease, images and words.

Ever since I started school people have been mispronouncing my name, with good reason. I've gotten Kaglin, Caitlin, Collin-- once someone even called me Charlie. Mostly teachers, usually substitutes, would reach my name on the attendance list and pause for a very long time, at which point I'd tentatively raise my hand and tell them how to say my name. Throughout school, I was painfully shy, but this call-to-attention that came from my pig-Latin name, I got used to it. My mom always told me my name was taken from ""girl"" in one language, ""warrior"" in another. Which I liked, considering I <i>am</i> a girl, and what fantasy reader to-be fantasy novelist doesn't want her name to mean warrior? Still, I was shallowly upset at the fact searching my own name online resulted in nothing, except a little squiggly red line underneath it and an auto correct. <i>Did you mean Caitlin Smith?</i> It still does that, but now when I search myself I get results that actually correspond with the correct spelling of my name; results about my books. It's kind of worth it in that way, to have this ridiculous name for so long, so now when I search it the first hit I get is what I'm most proud of in my life, my novel.</div><h3><br/></h3><h3>The Novel</h3><div>I say ""The Novel"" when inwardly I still think ""My Novel."" I can't help it. Even when so many people own a part of it now-- my publisher, editor, all the people who helped make it happen-- it's still my baby, still a piece of me that instinctively turns me possessive. It's weird. I feel like it's mine and I never want anyone to take it from me, but at the same time I want to give it away. I want people to love it and my upcoming novels as much as I do; so much that they become as instinctively possessive as me. Because as much as I write for myself, I write for other people. I want to give my readers what writers give me; a new reality, a new piece of myself, a new love. I want to share my writing and whatever it may give with everyone.</div><div><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""><br/></span></div><div>

</div><p>At least, not the facts about the novel itself, the really juicy stuff. I didn't even tell you the title. It's called <i>Hallow Hour</i> and, to be honest, when it first came out I was embarrassed when people asked me the title. I was a jumbled mess of shyness, pride, and social awkwardness whenever my book was brought up. I wasn't used to talking about my stories, let alone stories that could now be acquired at the local Chapters, read or skimmed, and brutally criticized. The whole thing terrified me. Then I started going into schools and reading to different grade levels from my book, with question periods after the reading. That knocked the embarrassment and shyness right out of me. These students, they actually liked my book. I couldn't believe it! I'd stop reading, right after a monster had attacked, or when a mysterious new character arrived, and they'd want me to continue! Of course I wouldn't, because I'm a writer, and don't we have this nasty tendency towards cliff-hangers? (Don't worry, I never left off at too painful a spot. I'm not <i>that</i> mean.) Point is, after all of this-- of actually seeing, in person, the excited, glowing reactions <i>I</i> have to a book on someone else about <i>my</i> book-- well, let's just say I don't mind telling people the title of my novel anymore. <i>Hallow Hour</i>.

As mentioned, it's called The Emerging Writers' Festival, held in Melbourne, Australia. <i>Australia</i>. As a youngster, I traveled around with my mom a bit, due to her job, but never have I gotten close to Australia. You know the Travel List, the one everyone has of places they want to see, at least once? For me, Australia is way, way up on that list. As in top three. Of course, I can't tell you which slot it takes, because that would be an early reveal, cutting the suspense. (I just can't turn off this writer business, see? It doesn't help that I'm also an English Major.) So the fact this Festival I've been invited to attend as a guest author is in Australia is one, huge thing, but the fact I'm being invited to attend <i>as a guest author?</i> I'm pretty sure this is one of those opportunities of a life-time that I've employed in past stories. (Or, you know, that I've heard of people getting in actual real life.) So to sum it all up-- hopefully eloquently, considering my chosen profession-- I, Caighlan Smith, 19 year old English Major at Memorial University of Newfoundland, who will soon have two novels out in a YA Fantasy, Post-apocalyptic, Adventure series, has started this campaign in hopes of going on her own fantasy adventure (I'll leave the post-apocalyptic for now, thanks.)

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<div>
<p>My name is Dave Hellman but some people call me Davey H. I'm a regular guy with a degree in Computer Science and Psychology and therefore not your typical self-help author. I’ve taken thousands of hours of coursework on nutrition, cooking and the food business; more than most physicians. I voraciously read magazines, books and have an inbox flooded with data on the subject. And when I’m not working my 6 AM to 6 PM job in high technology, I practice as a certified Exercise Nutrition Coach and an Integrative Health Coach. I trained at Duke University Integrative Medicine and Precision Nutrition, two of the leading and most prestigious institutions in their respective fields. I guide professional athletes and business people towards success.</p>

<h2>About this Campaign</h2>
<p>I introduced the <a href=""http://www.livelongleadlong.com/karma-sense/karma-sense-eating-plan-index/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Karma Sense Eating Plan</a> in the blog for my nutrition and health coaching practice, <a href=""http://www.livelongleadlong.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Live Long Lead Long</a>. I knew I was onto something but did not expect such fantastic reader response. As the series progressed, the requests for a book version increased. However, I continued with the blog version so I wouldn’t leave the existing readers hanging.<br/></p>
<p>I am the first to admit, the world does not need another healthy lifestyle/diet book. Fortunately, the Karma Sense Eating Plan is not just another healthy lifestyle/diet book. Because rather than force fitting some overbearing set of rules into your way of life, it reverse engineers a healthy lifestyle based on what you want most out of life as well as from your tastes, values, and inevitable constraints.</p>Currently, 80% of the content for this book is published on the web. But since then, I've expanded to include additional planning tools, recipes, food lists, and case studies. See the statistics below to get an idea of where the book currently stands.</div>

<h2>About Your Support</h2>
<div>I'm asking for your support to <u>assist</u> in funding the publishing of this book. I've carried all expenses to date and will continue to fund this project as needed. Here are some additional tasks I'd like to complete.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Developmental Editing</li>
<li>Copyediting</li>
<li>Artwork including cover art, improvement of some of the figures and overall design</li>
<li>Formatting for print and e-publishing</li>
<li>Administrative costs (e.g. getting an ISBN)</li>
<li>Promotion costs</li>
</ul>
<div>I have estimates for many of these tasks but no firm quotes. The goal is based on this estimate. I'll fully fund this project regardless of whether this campaign reaches its goal or if the expenses end up being greater than the total contribution. And if expenses are lower, I have a plan for that too.</div>
<div>Since<span style=""background-color: initial;""> this is a book about making you healthier, happier, and saving the world, I will donate <b>a</b></span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">ll </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">profits that result from the sale of this book to charities that fight poverty and hunger.

</div></div>","Executive SummaryThis campaign exists to fund a published version of the Karma Sense Eating Plan, a sincere yet light-hearted movement that improves your health, increases your happiness and enhances your appreciation for others. The Karma Sense Eating Plan originated as a series of blog posts at karma-sense.com.About the Karma Sense Eating Plan
Your weight? Your LDL/HDL?  Your A1C? Your health is about more than achieving some numeric value. Reaching a number won't give you long-term happiness. Besides, how do we make sense of the swirl of conflicting data on what to do for better health? The Karma Sense Eating Plan provides a realistic approach for achieving optimal health and happiness. It cuts through the scientific mumbo jumbo without taking itself too seriously. If you want to



Be healthier,
Be happier, and
Make the world a better place,
the Karma Sense Eating Plan is for you. It's an audacious goal, one that requires Karma Sense.
What it is




A suite of behaviors you can adopt in part or in whole;
An inclusive and tolerant lifestyle that makes no assumptions about your values, goals, lifestyle or schedule;
An opportunity to explore concepts of health and happiness in whatever depth you seek;
An evidenced-based approach to reach your goals.

What it isn't

A prescriptive plan that you can either pass or fail;
A list of restrictions that challenges your needs;
A boring or dogmatic review of nutrition and health facts;
A diet.

About the Author

My name is Dave Hellman but some people call me Davey H. I'm a regular guy with a degree in Computer Science and Psychology and therefore not your typical self-help author. I’ve taken thousands of hours of coursework on nutrition, cooking and the food business; more than most physicians. I voraciously read magazines, books and have an inbox flooded with data on the subject. And when I’m not working my 6 AM to 6 PM job in high technology, I practice as a certified Exercise Nutrition Coach and an Integrative Health Coach. I trained at Duke University Integrative Medicine and Precision Nutrition, two of the leading and most prestigious institutions in their respective fields. I guide professional athletes and business people towards success.



About this Campaign
I introduced the Karma Sense Eating Plan in the blog for my nutrition and health coaching practice, Live Long Lead Long. I knew I was onto something but did not expect such fantastic reader response. As the series progressed, the requests for a book version increased. However, I continued with the blog version so I wouldn’t leave the existing readers hanging.
I am the first to admit, the world does not need another healthy lifestyle/diet book. Fortunately, the Karma Sense Eating Plan is not just another healthy lifestyle/diet book. Because rather than force fitting some overbearing set of rules into your way of life, it reverse engineers a healthy lifestyle based on what you want most out of life as well as from your tastes, values, and inevitable constraints.Currently, 80% of the content for this book is published on the web. But since then, I've expanded to include additional planning tools, recipes, food lists, and case studies. See the statistics below to get an idea of where the book currently stands.
Book Stats


6x9 inch (A5) pages: 310


Footnotes: 124


Figures: 54


Tables: 21

Ridiculous Pop Culture References: Countless

About Your Support
I'm asking for your support to assist in funding the publishing of this book. I've carried all expenses to date and will continue to fund this project as needed. Here are some additional tasks I'd like to complete.


Developmental Editing
Copyediting
Artwork including cover art, improvement of some of the figures and overall design
Formatting for print and e-publishing
Administrative costs (e.g. getting an ISBN)
Promotion costs

I have estimates for many of these tasks but no firm quotes. The goal is based on this estimate. I'll fully fund this project regardless of whether this campaign reaches its goal or if the expenses end up being greater than the total contribution. And if expenses are lower, I have a plan for that too.
Since this is a book about making you healthier, happier, and saving the world, I will donate all profits that result from the sale of this book to charities that fight poverty and hunger. Your funding gets this project that much closer to profitability.

About the Perks
There are three types of perks associated with this campaign:


Be one of the first people to receive the Karma Sense Eating Plan either as an eBook or in its printed form.
Receive any one of the four Karma Sense personalized health coaching packages.
Become a member of the Karma Sense Advisory Board and help determine the charities that receive the profits from the sale of the Karma Sense Eating Plan book.

See the perks section of this campaign for specifics.
About the Risks



I'm carrying the risk of this project. The book already exceeds the quality of the typical self-published book. You can judge for yourself by reading the posts on my blog starting with the Karma Sense Index page. I've made significant improvements since then.
But even without outside funding, I'll invest in the editing and design work necessary to bring the quality up to a higher standard. I'm convinced that if even a small number of people adopt some or all of the elements of the Karma Sense Eating Plan, the world will be better off. That's incentive to make this book as desirable to others as possible.
Please don't let that stop you from contributing, though. Every cent I receive means more money for the charities that benefit from this initiative.
About Other Opportunities to Help
Besides your monetary contribution you can help in the following ways:


Read the Karma Sense Eating Plan in its current blog form and adopt the relevant elements for you. If you prefer, contact me and I'll send it to you in PDF format.
Provide me input on any aspects of this project regardless of whether it is this campaign, the content of the book, or anything else you think I should know.
Spread the word to your friends, relatives, colleagues, or random people you happen to encounter. Use email, social media, or whatever else works.
Share this campaign via the Indiegogo sharing tools.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Established in the conceptual framework of my first book <i>Decomposing The Shadow</i>, I offer you, with as much honesty as I can muster, <i>The True Light Of Darkness.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This book presents three of my most notable experiences of facing the darkness of my psyche through psilocybin. Each story takes place at different points of development within my own practice, and they progress with increasing darkness and complexity. This book explores how these experiences manifested in my personal consciousness, how I navigated and integrated them, as well as the explanations of the psychological, social, and spiritual mechanisms they expose.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">As <i><a href=""http://www.decomposingtheshadow.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Decomposing The Shadow</a> </i>is a book presented to engage the intellect, a book established on an accessibly scholarly approach to the psychology of psilocybin-educed spiritual experiences, its demographic is limited to a certain subset of people. Within the pages of this book, I offer a storytelling narrative to engage the heart and hopefully offer my process of effectively navigating deeply challenging emotional experiences with psychedelics to an even broader audience. </p>

<h2><span>About Me</span></h2>
<br/><p>My name is James W. Jesso. Four years ago I began a journey that would change my life forever by committing to taking a significant doses of (magic) Psilocybin Mushrooms once every month, and go out into the night alone to meditate and reflect on my life. Through this process I hoped to address some invasive and destructive mental illness patterns, particularly depression and borderline psychosis,  which had emerged from a year of destructive drug use. Over the thirteen months in which I remained committed to this practice, I changed my life entirely for the better. Since then, I have done everything I could to unlock these same potentials to as many people as possible.</p>

The Story
Established in the conceptual framework of my first book Decomposing The Shadow, I offer you, with as much honesty as I can muster, The True Light Of Darkness.
This book presents three of my most notable experiences of facing the darkness of my psyche through psilocybin. Each story takes place at different points of development within my own practice, and they progress with increasing darkness and complexity. This book explores how these experiences manifested in my personal consciousness, how I navigated and integrated them, as well as the explanations of the psychological, social, and spiritual mechanisms they expose.
As Decomposing The Shadow is a book presented to engage the intellect, a book established on an accessibly scholarly approach to the psychology of psilocybin-educed spiritual experiences, its demographic is limited to a certain subset of people. Within the pages of this book, I offer a storytelling narrative to engage the heart and hopefully offer my process of effectively navigating deeply challenging emotional experiences with psychedelics to an even broader audience. 
I need your help to bring this book to the masses. 



""This is about more than just getting a book funded, it's about deepening the culture around psilocybin so it can spread and inspire others. It's about letting others know they are not alone in the darkness they have faced and the benefits they have earned. This book is a fruiting body of something much larger than the author, and this campaign is the spore liberation. ""  Excerpt from the press release, read it here.

More About The Actual Content Of The Book






About Me
My name is James W. Jesso. Four years ago I began a journey that would change my life forever by committing to taking a significant doses of (magic) Psilocybin Mushrooms once every month, and go out into the night alone to meditate and reflect on my life. Through this process I hoped to address some invasive and destructive mental illness patterns, particularly depression and borderline psychosis,  which had emerged from a year of destructive drug use. Over the thirteen months in which I remained committed to this practice, I changed my life entirely for the better. Since then, I have done everything I could to unlock these same potentials to as many people as possible.



Where is your contribution going?

Several great people have offered their time and skills to assist with the project, and this campaign will help me to pay them for their investments.

I am completely funded by supporters like you. For me to keep going, all the support possible is needed.

Official SoundTrack Sampler



This is a brand new perk! The full album will be released at the same time as the book in July.

!?Fine Art Prints?!
""It is through this 'community' that great possibilities can come to fruit."" This is why I reached out to five inspiring and talented artists to read TLOD and capture their impression in an original work, specifically for this campaign. They have offered their time and skills to producing work inspired by TLOD to not only help with the campaign, but to help diversify the community intersecting around this project. Please take a movement to honour their efforts (pictures below).
These will be Limited Edition, Signed and Numbered, Archival Prints, and will only ever be 30 of each of them (EVER!).  25 each for the campaign  + five extra for each piece (two for the Artist, two for the author, and one to be held for donation to other projects funding psychedelic-research).
They will be printed through the a high end Giclee process on watercolour paper. ""The term  ""Giclee print"" connotes an elevation in printmaking technology. Images are generated from high resolution digital scans and printed with archival quality inks onto various substrates including canvas, fine art, and photo-base paper. The Giclee printing process provides better colour accuracy than other means of reproduction. Archival quality ensures that the prints are light-fast and non water soluble."" [source]
Take a look directly below, or at the Gallery Tab above, to see each what each print in order to select which one you want. (These images are only samples and the end product will be the image itself without the words and background, signed and numbered). After choosing this perk, place the name of the piece you want in the ""comments"" section of the campaign at the top of the page.

Due to feedback received, we have decided to KIV this experiment for now. We have written all funders and regret any inconvenience caused.CrowdPowers is a Singapore experiment to openly engage and empower strangers globally to pilot a new way of
doing business for everyone’s benefit.  By
eventually giving away up to 97% equity, CrowdPowers aspires to
become the world's first global crowd actualized branding agency, exclusively
focused on Tomorrow matters.
  


Terms will be crowd defined, progress will be
on www.crowdpowers.com and the initial proposed blueprint will be in the published
book.  As you participate, you will shift
mindsets from “Me” to “We” and yes, even invent your dream jobs/startups.


Our ""New century, old business models?” book
will share how different the 21st century is and kickstart creating
a global community of doers passionate about openly co-creating our shared
future. NOTE:  Book release is postponed to July 2014.  (See gallery for content and sample chapter) and website is BETA (yes, still buggy).


What we need & what you get

The initial $13,999 raised will seed costs of creating shared opportunities to crowd actualize a happier 21st
century:


Pilot the future of work around giving of our best for everyone's benefit

Share percentage of net profits from this
campaign with the best co creators

Crowd actualize book fulfillment (paperback, mobi and ePub versions) 

Develop and maintain Phase I responsive mobile website


Marketing and hosting charges


Crowdfund basic fees for 3-4 people to harness the power of the crowd to scale the
“Tomorrow matters” momentum

<p><strong>Write for Life: Expressive Writing for the Cancer Community</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>Every 23 seconds, someone in America is diagnosed with cancer. What if they began writing about their experience?</p>
<p>What if they could take better control of their situation by communicating more effectively and sharing their feelings?</p>
<p>Research conducted at the Lombardi Cancer Center at Georgetown University indicates that expressive writing––dealing with one’s deepest thoughts and emotions––may contribute to improved physical and emotional health.</p>
<p>A study in <em>The Oncologist</em> medical journal found patients who participated in a single 20-minute writing session improved their outlook on cancer and their physical quality of life.</p>
<p><strong>WHY I AM WRITING THIS BOOK</strong></p>
<p>Expressive writing can become a therapeutic, educational, and artistic tool not only for patients and survivors, but for caregivers, family members, friends and medical staff.</p>
<p>But the question persists: How do I start? This is often the toughest part for anyone, especially someone associated with a cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>Writing can be intimidating, especially finding entry points. <em>Write for Life</em> offers a simple collection of do-it-yourself exercises, prompts and examples to help anyone––and I mean anyone––make writing work for them in positive and healing ways.</p>
<p>Since cancer comes out of the blue, why not simplify a complex tapestry of emotions by breaking down the writing process into manageable and meaningful steps? That is what <em>Write for Life</em> is all about.</p>
<p><strong>WHO IS DAVID TABATSKY?</strong></p>
<p>I am the Co-author of Chicken Soup for the Soul’s <em>The Cancer Book: 101 Stories of Courage, Support &amp; Love</em>, and co-creator and facilitator of the Write to Fight Cancer workshop program (sponsored by Genentech), conducted in cancer centers around the country including The Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard University in Boston, and University of California Medical Center in San Francisco.</p>
<p>I am the editor of two cancer memoirs: <em>It’s Just a Word,</em> by Elizabeth Bayer and <em>Slipping Reality, </em>by Emily Beaver, as well as the co-author (with Mark Banschick MD) of <em>The Intelligent Divorce</em> book series and <em>The Wright Choice: Your Family’s Prescription for Healthy Eating, Modern Fitness</em> <em>and Saving Money</em> (with Randy Wright MD).</p>
<p>I am the founding editor of High School XPress, a national newspaper for secondary students and a teaching artist in the New York City public school special education system.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT STATUS</strong></p>
<p><em>Write for Life</em> has been in progress for the past year-and-a-half. Your support will allow me to finish the book, arrange the layout, finance the first print run and navigate distribution. I have excellent colleagues lined up to make this book a reality –– as soon as I finish the manuscript!</p>
<p>I aim to have the book in print by early fall to coincide with a series of live events I am conducting around the country in cancer centers, support institutions and therapy retreats, so it’s critical I raise the money now. Funds collected will pay for graphic design, website, printing, and initial distribution.</p>
<p>If you think this book can help people, please contribute!</p>
<p><strong>HOW THE FUNDING WORKS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your contributions of $100 or more are 100% tax deductible.</strong></p>

<p><strong>WHAT IF WE EXCEED THE FUNDING GOAL?</strong></p>

<p>Danke für Deine Zeit diese Seite zu lesen. Weil wir keinen Film haben ist der Text etwas länger geworden.<br/></p>
<p>Ich heisse Boris Gröber-Schuhmann. Ich mache diese Kampagne für Tatjana, meine Frau. Sie ist 43 Jahre alt und Mutter unserer 6-jährigen Tochter.<br/></p>
<p>Meine Frau leidet seit 4 Jahren an Krebs. In dieser Zeit hat sie alternative Heilungsmethoden, eine grosse OP, eine Chemotherapie und viele Krankenhausaufenthalte durchlaufen. Leider ist, trotz der Nebenwirkungen der Behandlungen, der Krebs immer wieder aktiv geworden. Die Schulmediziner sprechen nicht mehr von Heilungschancen, nur noch von Linderungsmöglichkeiten und ein wenig Zeitgewinn. Stück für Stück zerstört die Krankheit alles, was man als ein normales Leben, mit Höhen und Tiefen, bezeichnen könnte. Für sie, für uns als Familie. <br/></p>
<p>Trotz dieser scheinbar aussichtslosen Situation hat Tatjana nie die Hoffnung auf eine vollständige Heilung aufgegeben. Sie kämpft immer weiter, weil sie, wie sie sagt, noch so viele Aufgaben in ihrem Leben hat.</p>
<p>"" Ich möchte vollständig gesund werden. Ich möchte die starke innere Kraft der Heilung die in jedem von uns steckt beweisen. ""</p>
<p>Mir hat sie schon lange vor ihrer Erkrankung gesagt, dass sie einmal im Hospiz sterbende Menschen begleiten möchte. Ich war, will sagen: geschockt. Und ich weiss nicht ob es einfach meine eigene Angst vor dem Tod war, die sich da gezeigt hat, oder dieses überwältigende Mitgefühl von ihr. So ist sie : mitfühlend und unerschrocken. Unersetzlich. <br/></p>
<p>Tatjana ist mein bester Freund. Ich will dass sie diese Chance auf Heilung bekommt. Denn ohne baldige Heilung werden wir sie wahrscheinlich verlieren.</p>
<p>Konkret geht es um die Finanzierung einer neuen effektiven Ursachenbehandlung und einer mehrwöchigen stationären Krebstherapie (nach Dr. Max Gerson). Beide werden nicht von der Krankenkasse getragen. Die Kosten einschliesslich der Unterbringung, Verpflegung, Transportkosten und Gebühren betragen 10.000,-€.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Da es unter den gegebenen Umständen kaum möglich ist, einen halbwegs normalen Alltag als Familie aufrecht zu erhalten, ist uns bisher nicht gelungen hier einen Film zu präsentieren, der uns besser vorstellen könnte. <br/></p>
<p>Wenn der Gesamtbetrag nicht vollständig erreicht wird, dann wird Tatjana auf jeden Fall die erst genannte Behandlung finanzieren und versuchen, die Mittel für die Krebskur auf andere Art zu sammeln. <br/></p>
<p>Ehrlich können wir den Spendern nur den Dank zurückgeben einen mutig kämpfenden Menschen zu unterstützen. Einen Menschen der eine Diagnose wie `unheilbar` schon wegen der Hoffnungslosigkeit der Aussage nicht aktezptiert. Einen Menschen, der sich sein ganzes Leben weiterentwickeln will um zu beweisen, dass es für uns alle möglich ist Grenzen zu sprengen. Für sich, für sein Kind, für alle Menschen.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Bitte macht unsere Kampagne bekannt auch wenn Ihr nichts spenden könnt oder wollt.</p>
<p>Manch einer der uns kennt fühlt sich vielleicht verpflichtet oder gar genötigt uns zu unterstützen. Das wollen wir nicht: keiner von euch schuldet uns etwas. Bei dieser Kampagne geht darum eine faire Chance zu erhalten, auch wenn man selbst nicht genug Geld hat.<br/></p>
<p></p>

<p>Wer mehr über Tatjana erfahren möchte kann hier einige Dinge lesen die Freunde über sie sagen:</p>
<p>"" Sie ist einer der mutigsten Menschenl, die ich kenne. Obwohl sie von sich selbst meist zuviel erwartet, hat sie für andere immer ein gutes Wort, sprich: sie ist nachsichtig. Und sie tröstet auf eine Art, die überzeugt und mich schon aus einem tiefen Loch geholt hat. "" Freundin</p>
<p>""Ich habe Tatjana als einen sehr aufrichtigen Menschen kennengelernt, auf dessen Wort man sich verlassen kann. Sie zeigt stets grosses Engagement anderen zu helfen und zu unterstützen."" Freund<br/></p>

Support your national park by supporting the publication of this book of landscape photographs by Yosemite-photographer Nancy Robbins and essays by author Mas Masumoto.  In this breathtaking collection of photographs, essays, and extensive photographer’s notes, Yosemite visitors—and readers who haven’t yet made the trip—will follow an intrepid photographer to her favorite places and experience the park through her lens. This book not only reveals a beautiful landscape, it also shares a photographer’s stories of her adventures and a writer’s consideration of a public space in personal terms. Photographer Nancy Robbins arrived in the Sierra over a decade ago to photograph people in nature. Writer David “Mas” Masumoto farms peaches in California’s Central Valley. They intersect in Yosemite National Park, a 1200-square-mile jewel sculpted from granite, alive with crashing waterfalls, home to charismatic wildlife, and beloved of visitors from around the world. Once completed, proceeds from the sale of each copy of A Sense of Yosemite support enhancement projects in Yosemite National Park, helping to fund trail and habitat restoration, wildlife protection programs, scientific research, youth in Yosemite programs, and more.  The Conservancy needs to raise $10,000 for editing and color proofing of A Sense of Yosemite.Once we are able to raise funds for this book, we expect to bring this project to completion without obstacles. The Conservancy has a proven track record of publishing high quality books, from park maps to children’s storybooks to Yosemite history. Yosemite Conservancy provides for Yosemite’s future. We inspire people to support projects and programs that preserve and protect Yosemite National Park’s resources and enrich the visitor experience. As the park’s primary philanthropic partner, Yosemite Conservancy is providing for over 40 projects in 2015 alone through donations from generous Yosemite-lovers, purchases of authentic Yosemite books and educational products, and other programs. Thank you for supporting your park by supporting this Campaign through both your contribution and by sharing this with just one friend.

<h3>Longing to GO</h3>
<p>Every now and then we hear about a woman who seems to defy the culture, a woman who braves the great unknown and walks away with breathless tales. She has a certain something about her. We see her, and we wish we could be her, but a great many things keep us stuck right where we are. Resisting our deep inner urges, we often spend years vacillating, waiting and aching, afraid to go and afraid of not going. I was such a woman.</p>
<h3>Letting GO</h3>
<p>Finally, the pain of staying stuck outweighed the fear of moving forward. Last August, with very little planning and a lot of anxiety, I embarked on a solo journey that would take me from one corner of the country to the other, to the edge of myself and beyond. I packed my car as best I could figure, and with my 9-year-old pup as my only companion, I said goodbye to the life I knew and pressed down on the accelerator.</p>
<h3>Helping others GO</h3>
<p>Many women dream of travel and adventure, but they don't always understand why, and they are rarely encouraged to pursue these deep longings. I believe the Wild is calling to us, calling us to connect to nature, to our instincts and to our soul.</p>
<p>The Wild has secrets to impart to us. When a woman chooses to answer this call, she can learn the secrets to healing herself, her children and our planet. My purpose is to help more women move beyond the pain of being stuck and into her epic adventure in a way that is safe, smart and sacred.</p>

<h3>You can help</h3>
<p>I could have lived on the road for the rest of this year with the money I had saved. Instead, I chose to go all in on this book, and I committed more than I had left to make it happen. I believe in this message and the women who need to hear it. While I may travel solo, I am no lone ranger. I deeply appreciate making connections with like-minded people, and I believe these connections are critical to making a real impact in this world. Your support will help in many ways toward the realization of these results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Producing a book that actually makes a difference</li>
<li>Creating a publishing plan that achieves that goal</li>
<li>Creating a marketing plan that gets the message to the right audience</li>
<li>Having the tools and training needed to produce quality services</li>

<h3>Per iniziare...</h3>
<p>Buongiorno, mi chiamo Lorenzo Vargas e sono uno scrittore esordiente di 21 anni.</p>
<p>Dopo lungo peregrinare nel mondo editoriale (ho cominciato presto) ho raggiunto la consapevolezza che, fuor di certi canoni di tipo commerciale, senza un determinato background è quasi impossibile pubblicare qualcosa di nuovo sul panorama italiano oggigiorno.</p>
<p>Poi, all'improvviso, mi è venuta un'idea.</p>
<p>Essendo il libro PER i lettori, perchè non far scegliere a loro, se esso vedrà la luce o meno?</p>
<p>Per questo ho contattato due fidati disegnatori, anche loro esordienti, Matteo Stella ed Annamaria Dassori, per dare ulteriore valore all'opera con copertine ed illustrazioni originali.</p>
<p>Così è iniziato il progetto ""Pierre non Esiste""</p>
<p>Potete trovarlo <a href=""http://10kee.blogspot.it/2013/03/spam-per-amore-pierre-non-esiste.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">QUI</a> raccontato meglio da <a href=""http://10kee.blogspot.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lokee</a></p>

<h3><strong>Il Libro</strong></h3>
<p><strong><img alt=""Una copertina che vale di più di mille parole!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-h-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/294810_305854566214690_1169983806_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Nato nel 2011 da una malsana idea di esperimento diaristico, il libro (di cui potete golosamente vedere la copertina qua sopra) prende vita nei tempi morti delle lezioni, tra un caffè e dell'altro, in stati mentali non sempre dei più lucidi e parla di Pierre.</p>
<p>Pierre è un emerito signor nessuno che vive in una immaginario prossimo futuro orwelliano. Divide la sua esistenza tra una relazione insoddisfacente, un lavoro senza prospettive ed un mondo attorno a lui generalmente abbastanza scialbo.<br/>Il Nostro, però, sin da piccolo, soffre di una strana allucinazione paranoide, un personaggio multiforme di nome <em>Rho</em>, che non fa altro che chiedergli: <em>Sei felice?</em><br/>Ma cosa succede quando Pierre, per la prima volta ponderando la propria risposta, scuoterà la testa?<br/>E se Rho non fosse un'illusione?<br/>Se lo fosse <em>tutto il resto</em>?</p>
<p>Volete qualche informazione in più? O addirittura vorreste una piccola anteprima? <a href=""http://satisfiedpear.blogspot.it/p/blog-page.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CLICCATE QUI PER IL PRIMO CAPITOLO!</a></p>
<h3>Perché illustrato?</h3>
<p>Senza troppi mezzi termini, perchè si.<br/>Il romanzo è pieno trabordante di immagini evocative e situazioni grottesche (per non parlare del magico magico penultimo capitolo...) per questo motivo ho sentito il bisogno di illustrarlo.</p>
<p>Questa furba trovata risale però al primo tentativo, ancora convenzionale del romanzo. Ora, dovendovi offrire il libro migliore possibile (del <em>nostro</em> possibile) ho deciso di chiamare per la parte grafica persone capaci in questo campo quanto io reputo di essere nel mio.</p>
<p>La fortuna ha voluto recapitarmi Matteo Stella, un talentuosissimo tatuatore ed illustratore ed Annamaria Dassori, più che promettente artista digitale e non, che si sono occupati rispettivamente delle illustrazioni (una per capitolo, in un meraviglioso bianco/nero milleriano) ed alla più generale grafica ed estetica del volume (siete poc'anzi inciampati su uno dei prodotti della Dassori, la copertina).</p>
<p>I due hanno affrontato l'impresa (titanica se si considera che è stata portata avanti insieme all'Accademia delle Belle Arti) con la giusta determinazione, dando ancora una volta prova che ci sono in fondo ragazzi pronti ancora a tirarsi su le maniche per <em>creare</em> qualcosa.</p>
<p><img alt=""Illustrazione per il capitolo 1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/544217_277549785711835_2087922125_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Il nostro obiettivo</h3>
La campagna ha tre principali obiettivi:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Primo, dare alle stampe una prima tiratura del volume, che ammonterà a cinquecento copie (o più, dipende da voi), per poi presentarlo in giro per farlo conoscere al più vasto pubblico possibile.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Secondo, portare avanti l'intero processo editoriale in modo totalmente indipendente, appoggiandoci solo a mezzi <em>non convenzionali</em> e per lo più quasi open source. Ci saremo soltanto noi ed il denaro che ci concederete. <br/><br/>
</div>
<div>Terzo, permettere a tre esordienti di campi estremamente chiusi (mondo editoriale e dell'illustrazione) di potersi fare un nome con le proprie forze, senza dover passare per l'inevitabile fase di gavetta prostitutoria.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In questo modo speriamo di mandare un chiaro messaggio ad un mondo paralizzato da delle leggi di marketing che privilegiano nella diffusioni i <em>prodotti</em> alle <em>opere</em>.</div>
<div>
<h3>Un po' di numeri</h3>
<p>La base della campagna, 1600<span class=""st"">€, copre:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>La stampa delle prime 500 copie del romanzo.</li>
<li>L'invio di parte delle stesse tramite Piego di libri di Poste Italiane per le rispettive donazioni.</li>
<li>Cartoleria e affrancatura varia per il suddetto invio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tutti i fondi che eccederanno i 1600<span class=""st"">€</span> saranno utilizzati per organizzare e coordinare le presentazioni che allestiremo in modo quanto più uniforme secondo le esigenze di chi ci ha seguito.</p>
<p>Raggiunte particolari cifre-svolta, i fondi saranno riorganizzati come segue:</p>
<ul>
<li>2300€: La tiratura verrà raddoppiata ed aumenteranno anche le presentazioni.</li>
<li>3500€: Il libro verrà tradotto in lingua Inglese da un professionista ancora da definirsi</li>
<li>4500€: Verranno aggiunti ai premi (da 25€ in su) alcuni articoli di merchandise. Forse magliette. Troppo ottimismo mi divide dal pensare seriamente a cosa fare.</li>
<li>&gt;4500€: Tiratura di 1500 e vi GIURO, su ciò che mi è più caro al mondo, che vado a piedi alla direzione centrale Mondadori entro nell'ufficio del responsabile editoriale, gli grido PUPPA e poi me ne vado.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Lorenzo ""Glasya-Labolas"" Vargas</em></strong><br/><strong><em>Matteo Stella</em></strong><br/><strong><em>Annamaria ""Mepheesto"" Dassori</em></strong></p></div>","Per iniziare...
Buongiorno, mi chiamo Lorenzo Vargas e sono uno scrittore esordiente di 21 anni.
Dopo lungo peregrinare nel mondo editoriale (ho cominciato presto) ho raggiunto la consapevolezza che, fuor di certi canoni di tipo commerciale, senza un determinato background è quasi impossibile pubblicare qualcosa di nuovo sul panorama italiano oggigiorno.
Poi, all'improvviso, mi è venuta un'idea.
Essendo il libro PER i lettori, perchè non far scegliere a loro, se esso vedrà la luce o meno?
Per questo ho contattato due fidati disegnatori, anche loro esordienti, Matteo Stella ed Annamaria Dassori, per dare ulteriore valore all'opera con copertine ed illustrazioni originali.
Così è iniziato il progetto ""Pierre non Esiste""
Potete trovarlo QUI raccontato meglio da Lokee
Oppure QUI, sviolinato da Cronache Maceratesi.it!
Il Libro

Nato nel 2011 da una malsana idea di esperimento diaristico, il libro (di cui potete golosamente vedere la copertina qua sopra) prende vita nei tempi morti delle lezioni, tra un caffè e dell'altro, in stati mentali non sempre dei più lucidi e parla di Pierre.
Pierre è un emerito signor nessuno che vive in una immaginario prossimo futuro orwelliano. Divide la sua esistenza tra una relazione insoddisfacente, un lavoro senza prospettive ed un mondo attorno a lui generalmente abbastanza scialbo.Il Nostro, però, sin da piccolo, soffre di una strana allucinazione paranoide, un personaggio multiforme di nome Rho, che non fa altro che chiedergli: Sei felice?Ma cosa succede quando Pierre, per la prima volta ponderando la propria risposta, scuoterà la testa?E se Rho non fosse un'illusione?Se lo fosse tutto il resto?
Volete qualche informazione in più? O addirittura vorreste una piccola anteprima? CLICCATE QUI PER IL PRIMO CAPITOLO!
Perché illustrato?
Senza troppi mezzi termini, perchè si.Il romanzo è pieno trabordante di immagini evocative e situazioni grottesche (per non parlare del magico magico penultimo capitolo...) per questo motivo ho sentito il bisogno di illustrarlo.
Questa furba trovata risale però al primo tentativo, ancora convenzionale del romanzo. Ora, dovendovi offrire il libro migliore possibile (del nostro possibile) ho deciso di chiamare per la parte grafica persone capaci in questo campo quanto io reputo di essere nel mio.
La fortuna ha voluto recapitarmi Matteo Stella, un talentuosissimo tatuatore ed illustratore ed Annamaria Dassori, più che promettente artista digitale e non, che si sono occupati rispettivamente delle illustrazioni (una per capitolo, in un meraviglioso bianco/nero milleriano) ed alla più generale grafica ed estetica del volume (siete poc'anzi inciampati su uno dei prodotti della Dassori, la copertina).
I due hanno affrontato l'impresa (titanica se si considera che è stata portata avanti insieme all'Accademia delle Belle Arti) con la giusta determinazione, dando ancora una volta prova che ci sono in fondo ragazzi pronti ancora a tirarsi su le maniche per creare qualcosa.

Il nostro obiettivo
La campagna ha tre principali obiettivi:
 
Primo, dare alle stampe una prima tiratura del volume, che ammonterà a cinquecento copie (o più, dipende da voi), per poi presentarlo in giro per farlo conoscere al più vasto pubblico possibile.
 
Secondo, portare avanti l'intero processo editoriale in modo totalmente indipendente, appoggiandoci solo a mezzi non convenzionali e per lo più quasi open source. Ci saremo soltanto noi ed il denaro che ci concederete. 

Terzo, permettere a tre esordienti di campi estremamente chiusi (mondo editoriale e dell'illustrazione) di potersi fare un nome con le proprie forze, senza dover passare per l'inevitabile fase di gavetta prostitutoria.
 
In questo modo speriamo di mandare un chiaro messaggio ad un mondo paralizzato da delle leggi di marketing che privilegiano nella diffusioni i prodotti alle opere.

Un po' di numeri
La base della campagna, 1600€, copre:

La stampa delle prime 500 copie del romanzo.
L'invio di parte delle stesse tramite Piego di libri di Poste Italiane per le rispettive donazioni.
Cartoleria e affrancatura varia per il suddetto invio.

Tutti i fondi che eccederanno i 1600€ saranno utilizzati per organizzare e coordinare le presentazioni che allestiremo in modo quanto più uniforme secondo le esigenze di chi ci ha seguito.
Raggiunte particolari cifre-svolta, i fondi saranno riorganizzati come segue:

2300€: La tiratura verrà raddoppiata ed aumenteranno anche le presentazioni.
3500€: Il libro verrà tradotto in lingua Inglese da un professionista ancora da definirsi
4500€: Verranno aggiunti ai premi (da 25€ in su) alcuni articoli di merchandise. Forse magliette. Troppo ottimismo mi divide dal pensare seriamente a cosa fare.
>4500€: Tiratura di 1500 e vi GIURO, su ciò che mi è più caro al mondo, che vado a piedi alla direzione centrale Mondadori entro nell'ufficio del responsabile editoriale, gli grido PUPPA e poi me ne vado.

Ovviamente, qualora non raggiungessimo il nostro obiettivo, la campagna è programmata in modo che non ci arrivi nemmeno un centesimo, al che torneremo piangendo dal pertugio da cui siamo gocciolati all'inizio di questa avventura. Forse qualcuno di noi non supererà la notte per lo shock.
Ma niente è per niente...

Le vostre non saranno veramente donazioni.
Il punto di questa piattaforma è che i soldi non sono donazioni ma finanziamenti e come tali hanno una ricompensa:


10€Vi verrà inviato il libro a casa, senza spese di spedizioni, autografato dall'autore. 


15€Come sopra, ma la copia sarà autografata (e disegninata) da tutti e tre i colpevoli del Progetto.

20€Come la ricompensa da 15€, in più vi contatterò per scrivere una piccola paginetta illustrata su di voi con la mia fidata Lettera22. Il tutto ovviamente condito dal mio personalissimo tocco di persona molto bisognosa di un trattamento al litio. Un esempio QUI!

25€Come la ricompensa da 15€, più il vostro nome (o pseudonimo) sarà nella pagina dei ringraziamenti del libro, ben evidenziato con un evidenziatore di nostra scelta. (Max. 200)

40€Come la ricompensa da 15€, più una riproduzione ad alta risoluzione di una delle illustrazioni del romanzo, scelta ed autografata dai tre colpevoli 


100€Come la ricompensa da 15€, più un artwork originale (a voi la scelta se fatto da Matteo o Anna) su vostra consegna. Ovviamente tri-autografato. (Max. 20)

600€Come nella ricompensa da 25€, più ci impegnamo, ovunque viviate a fare una presentazione nel vostro paese (o dintorni), intrattenerci a pranzo/cena con voi e, se sarete così gentili da lasciarci una cuccia di cane dove dormire, vi faremo compagnia tutta la giornata, per poi sparire nelle nebbie una volta tornato il sole. Vi autograferemo tutto quello che vi pare, da fogli a mobili a parti del corpo. Unica cosa, dovete indicarci un luogo dove fare la presentazione, a metterci daccordo coi tizi ci pensiamo noi. (Max. 10)

Non vuoi aiutarci finanziariamente, ma vuoi comunque sostenere il progetto?
Se non potete permettervi di pagare anche solo 10 euro per un libro, ma il senso di colpa vi spinge, come un imperativo morale kantiano, a sostenerci comunque, diffondete la pagina, fate passaparola, consigliate a parenti e amici, fatevi foraggiare dai vostri genitori, insomma fate in modo che la notizia si imprima in più cervelli possibile.
In questo modo potremo raggiungere obiettivi che nemmeno ci saremmo immaginati!
Il progetto vi incuriosisce, ma avete ancora dubbi?
Venite a farci TUTTE le domande che vi saltano in mente sulla PAGINA FACEBOOK o, se siete timidi, basta un messaggio personale!
Siamo a disposizione.
E per concludere...
Donate, donate, donate!
Non mi ripeterò mai abbastanza, questo è un progetto importante e purtroppo ancora insolito nel nostro Bel paese. Sarete parte di una svolta.
Non vorrei che vi pentiste del contrario

<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">(</span>Excerpt from<i> Positive Choices = Positive Behavior: Choices That Affect Your Character, Life, and Relationships</i><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">)</span><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">INTRODUCTION<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">ACKNOWLEDGING MY PERSONAL CHOICES</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Something snapped within me! I
felt extremely angry, broken, exhausted, frustrated, and scared. <span>After more than 40 years of being a victim and taking abuse
from my family and husband, I finally came to a point where I had had
enough!  I needed a break!  Hadn't I suffered enough?  Something
had to change—soon! I cried out in desperation, “Please
God, help me! Someone please help me! </span>I’m
so tired of being abused, especially by the people who are supposed to love me.
I need some serious help with my situation, God. I know You’ve always been
there for me and have my best interests at heart. Would You please show me how
to make my life better? I’ll do whatever it takes, God. Just please help me!
Thank you!” </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A
few days later my answer came to me as an “aha” moment: <i>I can react and respond either negatively or positively to people or
situations. The choice is mine.</i> Wow!
This “aha” moment triggered something deep within my soul. It was like a switch
that instantly turned my negative, oppressive outlook about my life into a
positive, promising one. I no longer felt totally overwhelmed with the painful
emotions concerning my husband, family members, other people, and myself. I
acknowledged that we all have the power of free will. I felt empowered to seize
the moment and take control of my life. This was the crucial turning point in
my life that prepared me to answer the questions of how and why I reacted and
responded negatively to people. This turning point also helped me realize why I
remained angry and bitter with these people who had offended me during the
course of my lifetime. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">ADDRESSING MY PERSONAL CHOICES</span></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">

Besides feeling angry with, fearful of, and neglected
by my husband, family members, and certain other people, I felt powerless, unacceptable,
unforgivable, unloved, unwanted, and unworthy. Taking positive action and
addressing my personal choices, <span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;""> I
recognized the significance of my negative and positive reactions (with body
language) and responses (with words) to people in various situations. Desiring to
make significant improvements in my life, I wrote regularly in a journal about my
negative reactions and
responses in respect to anger, criticism, fear, forgiveness,
love, personal power, rejection, and relationships. I analyzed the </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">how </i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">and </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">why </i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">of my past
negative reactions and responses plus looked at my choices from other people’s
point-of-view. I finally understood how my destructive behavioral patterns caused
the unfavorable outcomes of damaging my character, harming my quality of life,
and weakening my relationships. It was time for me to take responsibility for
the numerous negative choices I had made. After I started making more positive
choices, I found that I was able to put the past behind me, heal my emotional
wounds, and move forward with my life.</span></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Exhibiting
courage, having an attitude of gratitude, and maintaining a sense of humor have
helped me behave toward people
and situations in a positive, reasonable, and respectful manner. I</span> <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">have confronted
and conquered my fears, managed my anger properly, and supported others. I now
accept, forgive, and love myself and others, in addition to giving love to
others and receiving love from them. My new constructive practice of positive
behavior has produced the favorable outcomes of enhancing my character,
improving my quality of life, and strengthening my relationships. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My
life-changing “aha” moment and incredible journey of transformation, in
conjunction with drawing on my experiences, common sense, empathy, life
lessons, observations, and wisdom, serve as the basis for <i>Positive
Choices = Positive Behavior: Choices that Affect Your Character, Life, and
Relationships</i>. I’m not a mental health professional,
nor do I have a degree in communication, counseling, or psychology. What I do
know for sure is that my life purpose is to serve others through communication.
As an author, a mentor, and a speaker, my mission is:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">• 
To plant the seeds of awareness in you
about your negative and positive choices</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">• 
To prompt you to work through the
consequences from your past reactions and responses and to make more positive
choices on a daily basis</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">• 
To suggest helpful, practical ways for
you to enhance your character, to improve your quality of life, and to
strengthen your relationships</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Within
this self-help book, I share a few of my negative and positive choices in each
chapter along with the valuable life lessons I’ve learned from them. If I, an
average individual, can enhance my character, improve my quality of life, and
strengthen my relationships as a result of making more positive choices on a
daily basis, you can too. My intention is to be your mentor and inspire you to
work through your own personal issues in a constructive manner. In doing so,
this can pave the way for you to heal your emotional wounds regarding other
people’s habitual offensive behavior toward you, as well as your destructive
reactions and responses toward them. Deciding to accept and forgive yourself
and others can become a reality if that’s what you truly want.<span> As a means of
encouragement during your journey of transformation, I will provide you
with some tools for confronting and conquering your fears, managing your anger properly, and supporting others. In addition, it is my hope to help
you deal with your relationships so you can open your heart to loving yourself
and others unconditionally. Together you and I <i>can</i> make a positive difference in this world! Are you interested?

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>Positive
Choices = Positive Behavior</i>
has two objectives. First, examine your negative reactions and responses to
others in general. Second, explore how you can make more positive choices and
behave more positively toward people instead. This self-help book covers topics
relating to your anger, criticism and support, fear, forgiveness, love,
personal power, rejection and acceptance, and relationships. It’s my desire to
encourage you in each chapter so you will feel empowered to make the commitment
to enhance your character, improve your quality of life, and strengthen your
relationships.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The vast majority of this self-help
book <span>is <i>about</i> you and <i>for</i> you<i>. </i>Use </span>your
own “aha” moments, common sense, life experiences, logic, and wisdom to assess
your personal choices and to learn more about your behavior. While working through this workbook, you may find
yourself at times basing your reactions and responses on your feelings.
Sometimes you may base them on your logic. Neither method is “right,” nor
“wrong.” The many “aha” moments you may experience as you read through this book could be felt on either an
emotional or intellectual level.</span></p>

what you think when someone reacts and responds negatively to another person or even to you. Would it be a wise move on your part to start behaving in a
more positive manner toward everyone? Imagine how making more good
choices on a daily basis could produce more favorable outcomes in your life. Are
you ready to do the necessary work to become
a stronger emotional, intellectual, and spiritual individual than you ever

(Excerpt from Positive Choices = Positive Behavior: Choices That Affect Your Character, Life, and Relationships)
INTRODUCTION 


ACKNOWLEDGING MY PERSONAL CHOICES



Something snapped within me! I
felt extremely angry, broken, exhausted, frustrated, and scared. After more than 40 years of being a victim and taking abuse
from my family and husband, I finally came to a point where I had had
enough!  I needed a break!  Hadn't I suffered enough?  Something
had to change—soon! I cried out in desperation, “Please
God, help me! Someone please help me! I’m
so tired of being abused, especially by the people who are supposed to love me.
I need some serious help with my situation, God. I know You’ve always been
there for me and have my best interests at heart. Would You please show me how
to make my life better? I’ll do whatever it takes, God. Just please help me!
Thank you!” 

A
few days later my answer came to me as an “aha” moment: I can react and respond either negatively or positively to people or
situations. The choice is mine. Wow!
This “aha” moment triggered something deep within my soul. It was like a switch
that instantly turned my negative, oppressive outlook about my life into a
positive, promising one. I no longer felt totally overwhelmed with the painful
emotions concerning my husband, family members, other people, and myself. I
acknowledged that we all have the power of free will. I felt empowered to seize
the moment and take control of my life. This was the crucial turning point in
my life that prepared me to answer the questions of how and why I reacted and
responded negatively to people. This turning point also helped me realize why I
remained angry and bitter with these people who had offended me during the
course of my lifetime. 

ADDRESSING MY PERSONAL CHOICES


Besides feeling angry with, fearful of, and neglected
by my husband, family members, and certain other people, I felt powerless, unacceptable,
unforgivable, unloved, unwanted, and unworthy. Taking positive action and
addressing my personal choices,  I
recognized the significance of my negative and positive reactions (with body
language) and responses (with words) to people in various situations. Desiring to
make significant improvements in my life, I wrote regularly in a journal about my
negative reactions and
responses in respect to anger, criticism, fear, forgiveness,
love, personal power, rejection, and relationships. I analyzed the how and why of my past
negative reactions and responses plus looked at my choices from other people’s
point-of-view. I finally understood how my destructive behavioral patterns caused
the unfavorable outcomes of damaging my character, harming my quality of life,
and weakening my relationships. It was time for me to take responsibility for
the numerous negative choices I had made. After I started making more positive
choices, I found that I was able to put the past behind me, heal my emotional
wounds, and move forward with my life.
Exhibiting
courage, having an attitude of gratitude, and maintaining a sense of humor have
helped me behave toward people
and situations in a positive, reasonable, and respectful manner. I have confronted
and conquered my fears, managed my anger properly, and supported others. I now
accept, forgive, and love myself and others, in addition to giving love to
others and receiving love from them. My new constructive practice of positive
behavior has produced the favorable outcomes of enhancing my character,
improving my quality of life, and strengthening my relationships. 
My
life-changing “aha” moment and incredible journey of transformation, in
conjunction with drawing on my experiences, common sense, empathy, life
lessons, observations, and wisdom, serve as the basis for Positive
Choices = Positive Behavior: Choices that Affect Your Character, Life, and
Relationships. I’m not a mental health professional,
nor do I have a degree in communication, counseling, or psychology. What I do
know for sure is that my life purpose is to serve others through communication.
As an author, a mentor, and a speaker, my mission is:
• 
To plant the seeds of awareness in you
about your negative and positive choices
• 
To prompt you to work through the
consequences from your past reactions and responses and to make more positive
choices on a daily basis
• 
To suggest helpful, practical ways for
you to enhance your character, to improve your quality of life, and to
strengthen your relationships
Within
this self-help book, I share a few of my negative and positive choices in each
chapter along with the valuable life lessons I’ve learned from them. If I, an
average individual, can enhance my character, improve my quality of life, and
strengthen my relationships as a result of making more positive choices on a
daily basis, you can too. My intention is to be your mentor and inspire you to
work through your own personal issues in a constructive manner. In doing so,
this can pave the way for you to heal your emotional wounds regarding other
people’s habitual offensive behavior toward you, as well as your destructive
reactions and responses toward them. Deciding to accept and forgive yourself
and others can become a reality if that’s what you truly want. As a means of
encouragement during your journey of transformation, I will provide you
with some tools for confronting and conquering your fears, managing your anger properly, and supporting others. In addition, it is my hope to help
you deal with your relationships so you can open your heart to loving yourself
and others unconditionally. Together you and I can make a positive difference in this world! Are you interested?
Read on.

ASSESSING YOUR PERSONAL CHOICES
Positive
Choices = Positive Behavior
has two objectives. First, examine your negative reactions and responses to
others in general. Second, explore how you can make more positive choices and
behave more positively toward people instead. This self-help book covers topics
relating to your anger, criticism and support, fear, forgiveness, love,
personal power, rejection and acceptance, and relationships. It’s my desire to
encourage you in each chapter so you will feel empowered to make the commitment
to enhance your character, improve your quality of life, and strengthen your
relationships.
The vast majority of this self-help
book is about you and for you. Use your
own “aha” moments, common sense, life experiences, logic, and wisdom to assess
your personal choices and to learn more about your behavior. While working through this workbook, you may find
yourself at times basing your reactions and responses on your feelings.
Sometimes you may base them on your logic. Neither method is “right,” nor
“wrong.” The many “aha” moments you may experience as you read through this book could be felt on either an
emotional or intellectual level.

CHALLENGING YOUR PERSONAL CHOICES
Ask yourself how you feel or
what you think when someone reacts and responds negatively to another person or even to you. Would it be a wise move on your part to start behaving in a
more positive manner toward everyone? Imagine how making more good
choices on a daily basis could produce more favorable outcomes in your life. Are
you ready to do the necessary work to become
a stronger emotional, intellectual, and spiritual individual than you ever
imaged you could be? Millions of people around the world have done this. Yes,
you can do this too! I’m right here
to assist and to motivate you. How about we do this together? Today, make
positive choices! 




AWARD WINNER


Positive Choices =
Positive Behavior is a Bronze medal winner in the motivational category in the 2013 Readers’ Favorite
contest out of six finalists. Click on their link http://readersfavorite.com/2013-award-contest-winners.htm. This manuscript also received a 5-star review from
Readers' Favorite as well. What is amazing about this is that I won this award despite the
fact that I had not had it edited by anyone, nor had it been read by others
except for the reviewers and my daughter. You can read more about this award on
my website book page at www.NancyJanke.com/books/ plus other news on my blog page at www.NancyJanke.com/blog-1/.


USE OF FUNDS

I am
raising funds to self-publish my book as I do not have the funds to do so at
this time. I have spent the last eight years passionately and tirelessly working
full-time on myself while writing this book for other people who have gone
through what I have (abuse victim, divorce, low self-esteem, rejection, toxic
relationships). Thankfully, I have been transformed into a confident,
determined, and passionate woman who is accepting, forgiving, and loving. 
In the
past year, I have run out of money and am now staying with my ex-husband, which
is not the best situation for me. But, it’s either that or living in my car or
a homeless shelter.
I will
be self-publishing Positive
Choices = Positive Behavior as a paperback through either Create Space
or Lightning Source plus have a Kindle version as well. In paying additional
money for expanded distribution, my book will be available through book
distributors and Barnes & Noble throughout the U.S. plus Canada and Europe.

RISKS AND CHALLENGES
There is minimum risk of
this project is as the manuscript (54,000+ words) for Positive Choices = Positive Behavior is
completed. As of October 1, 2013, this book has been edited by two professional editors who were previously editors at small publishing houses. The next steps are having the custom work done for my unique book interior, the book cover created, and having the galleys
done and approved. Once approved, the paperback goes live on Amazon. Once this is done, I will have the book formatted for the Kindle as well as I-books and Smashwords.

Non-Fiction Book & Audio Book by Larry Dvoskin
Since the age of 12, I have been loving making music. From the age of 15, I started earning money playing out.  At 18 I toured nationally behind 3 albums with a band on a major label, and I've been supporting myself in the business ever since.Do What You Love -- the book and audio book -- will share my proven insights about creating lasting happiness, finding personal fulfillment, and living your dreams. 
Through high-tide and low, making both hits and ho-hummers's, I live my life relying on a set of keys -- the insights in Do What You Love -- that not only have made me happy, but countless dozens of people in my personal life as well who have been inspired, consoled, and driven by these hard-earned, but simply-stated, insights. 
DOES 'DO WHAT YOU LOVE' WORK?
For me, the proof is in the precious metals that hang in the form of records on my walls.  I've sold millions of songs as a coauthor, and earned enough trust in my field to work with the most respected performers in worldfrom most-recently Sony Records and MGMT, David Bowie, Van Halen vocalist Sammy Hagar, Sean Lennon, Bono's One.Org, Paul Doucette of Matchbox 20, Alec Baldwin, Al Jardine & Carl Wilson of The Beach Boys, Bad Company, to being signed by RCA, Capitol Records, EMI, Warner Chappell, Famous Music to touring opening for Queen, Chicago, Allman Brothers, Tom Petty and many others.
IS THIS LECTURE-Y OR FUN?
It's fun, purely.  My life and work has been about the momentum of spiritual fire.  I'm just here, my dear, to set you ablaze in the light of your best work on earth.

<p>Arenas escaped Cuba in 1980 in the Mariel exodus after being in jail for over three years for false accusations of “child molestation” and for “publishing outside Cuba without the permission of the UNEAC”. Arenas was marginalized for his homosexuality and for defying the Revolution’s control on freedom of speech by publishing his books outside Cuba.</p>
<p>Arenas “attacks to the Cuban government were based on the policies against homosexuals in Cuba”.

<p>David Fernández</p></div>","Celestino antes del alba (1967) is Reinaldo Arenas’ first novel and only book he ever published in Cuba. Ediciones Unión printed the novel after it received a honourable mention in National Literary Contest Cirilo Villaverde in 1965. The novel was written while Arenas worked at the National Library. The Cuban artist Manuel Vidal designed the artwork for the edition of 2,000 copies. The book sold out in one week and it was never reprinted in Cuba, but due to its limited run “the author’s reputation was restricted to a small number of Cubans”. Arenas’ second novel, El mundo alucinante [Hallucinations] received another recognition at a national literary award but it was not printed due to rumours of Arena’s homosexuality  Arenas smuggled out of the island the manuscripts of Celestino antes del alba and El mundo alucinante that were published in France by Editions du Seuil, and the manuscript of Con los ojos cerrados that was published by Editorial Arca in Uruguay.
Arenas escaped Cuba in 1980 in the Mariel exodus after being in jail for over three years for false accusations of “child molestation” and for “publishing outside Cuba without the permission of the UNEAC”. Arenas was marginalized for his homosexuality and for defying the Revolution’s control on freedom of speech by publishing his books outside Cuba.
Arenas “attacks to the Cuban government were based on the policies against homosexuals in Cuba”. Later in exile he would become the most outspoken critic of the treatment of homosexuals during the Revolution. His legacy relies on his courageous accounts of repression during the 1960s and 1970s against homosexuals and freedom.

The Road So Far
Back in 2011 I published the first novel of my alternate history/WW2 series The Burning Ages, called Wolf Hunt to the acclaim of critics and fellow authors alike.
One of the best this year ... engaged me from the first page to the last. [Sift Book Reviews]Terrific multi-genre fiction! [William P. Grasso, author of East Wind Returns]First rate, action packed techno-thriller and alternate history. [Steven Konkoly, author of The Jakarta Pandemic]
Wolf Hunt is part technothriller, part alternate history in the style of John Birmingham's Axis of Time trilogy or Eric Flint's Ring of Fire. It explores, among others, social and historical themes like racism and guilt, featuring a wide range of actual historic figures, ranging from J. Edgar Hoover and F.D.R. to Adolf Hitler. And it ends with a radically altered year 1940.
If you like to find out more you can dig into some post here talking about the setting and the events of Book 1. And you can read the first 3 chapters under the tag ""Samples"" here.
Now Clash of Eagles starts where Wolf Hunt ended.
Adolf Hitler is dead. The Führer of Nazi Germany has been brought down by a bold attack, led by the mastermind of Germany's military intelligence organization, the Abwehr, Wilhelm Canaris. But Canaris did not act on his own. Soldiers - men and women - from the future, flung back in time by a strange tempest, fought at the conspirators' side. The course of history has been changed.But not all is well.  The Nazis are shocked and battered, but far from beaten. Reinhard Heydrich, the head of the Nazi security apparatus and new self-proclaimed Reichsführer, is gathering his forces as occupied Europe finds itself cut in half, embroiled in a German civil war. With Germany in disarray, Italy's fascist leaders are seeking glory and conquests of their own. Across the Channel, Churchill's Britain stands undefeated and defiant, confident that the time has come to turn the tides of this war.
And while the United States stands as a distant towering giant, with ""Uptimers"" of its own working to prepare it for the coming struggle, the realization of those in Germany that there is more than one devil (and he may come offering gifts) may just propell their fellowship into a precipice...

ï¿½Itï¿½s probably nothing serious, but you might want to
get it checked outï¿½ 


These are the words that I heard from a nurse standing
in my house in 1992. These words would act as the ï¿½seedï¿½ to this incredible
story. 


             I didnï¿½t know it then, but these words would lead to a
defining moment in my life. A trial that I would be forced to go through. That
would cause me to question who I was, all that I had believed, and God himself.


             I had played Jesus Christ in a passion drama for 9
years, the same drama that brought me to the Lord in 2001. I was also a
successful girls fastpitch softball coach for 7 years, coaching girls from 10
& under all the way to the high school level. I work for a fire sprinkler contractor
in Toledo, OH and have worked there for 20 years. I am married to a lovely lady
and have 2 beautiful daughters.


But in 2010, I was left standing on the outside
looking in, as I came to the realizationï¿½ 


ï¿½life as I knew it was overï¿½ 


I would begin a race against time to go on dialysis
and get a kidney transplant as my kidneys began to shut down. Only to find out
that the one thing that was supposed to keep me alive, was actually killing me. It wasnï¿½t till he delivered me through the
valley of the shadow of death, through incredible odds and miraculous events.
It was then that I realized ï¿½why this happened to meï¿½. 
It was to write this book and to share with you, the
hope of what I know to be true. In my darkest moment, as I lay on deaths door
step. Hope showed up in a miraculous way! That is the same hope that is with you
through all of your trials. 
This story is not just about me. This story is your
own as well. My battle was life and death as my kidneys began to shut down.
Yours may have been another health issue, the loss of a loved one, the changing
of a career, or some other trial that was unforeseen. 
We all have a story to tell, your experience may be
the inspiration that gives ï¿½Another 2nd Chanceï¿½ to someone else. 

              Sometimes I look back over the things that happened
and marvel at all of the incredible events that took place. Events that were
taking place years earlier. Events taking place half way across the nation. These
things had to fall into place to create this incredible story, all leading up
to one main event in July of 2010. 
 
""It was then that I realized those seeds that God had been dropping had blossomed into a beautiful reflection of my past. There was beauty in the broken path, joy in the suffering, and meaning in the journey.""

              Just when I counted on a brothers Love to save me, it
was a Fathers love that saved us both. A thousand miles away, a stranger
stepped up and courageously gave with nothing expected in return. 

             I could not have imagined what
God had in store for all who were part of this story and Hollywood couldnï¿½t have
scripted it. This is a story that is written in the lives
of all involved by the sovereign creator of the universe. 

This
is Gods Story!

<p><br/><br/>Hi! I'm Heather and I'm passionate about building peace and empathy through learning history. To that end, I've been podcasting on Tudor history since 2009 when I launched the Renaissance English History Podcast. Even before then, I built my first history website in 1998! In 2016 I created the Tudor Planner, which brings together all the awesome of a weekly/monthly diary with Tudor history. There's This Week in History, musical listening lists, quotes, all wrapped up in a gorgeous cover that looks like a manuscript.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Basics About the Tudor Planner:</h3>
<p>I'm passionate about planners myself, and am always checking out new ones. This planner incorporates planning elements that I love, in a layout that will be familiar, while also mixing in tons of Tudor history, in a style that resembles a manuscript.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pages are 6x9 inches (close to an A5 size). The cover adds a bit of extra space, but doesn't hang out very much further (see photos for more detail).</li>
<li>The cover changes each year, but is always a Tudor period work, <strong>evoking the feel of 16th century England</strong>.</li>
<li>Dated<strong> Weekly and monthly layouts</strong>, the Tudor Planner runs from December 2020 to February 2022 so you can start to use it straight away, and it will carry you through planning early in the following year. </li>
<li>End-of-month <strong>check in pages</strong> to keep you on track with your goals, and set the stage for a productive new month.</li>
<li>Plenty of <strong>notes pages</strong>, including dotted, lined, and plain.</li>
<li>Three pages of <strong>stickers</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Two sided pocket</strong> in the back to hold papers and notes.</li>
<li>
<strong>All major holidays noted, as well as many Tudor feast days</strong>. Of course the Tudors lived through the Reformation (which manifested itself a little differently in England than in the rest of Europe) so the holidays our Tudor friends would have had in 1590 were different than in 1510. Still, the major and most popular ones are included.</li>
<li>Each week has an interesting <strong>Tudor fact that happened that week</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Music suggestions each month</strong>, and a link to a Spotify playlist so you can listen to Tallis while planning.</li>
<li>All planners shipped through this IndieGoGo fundraiser will include a <strong>signed thank you postcard</strong>.</li>
<li>Spiral binding allows the planner to lie flat.</li>
<li>High quality 120gsm Golden Sun Uncoated Woodfree paper</li>
<li>Shipped from Maryland, USA</li>
<li><i>Created with love by a writer who has been sharing stories about history online for over 22 years.</i></li>
<li>The Tudor Planner layouts run Monday to Sunday.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Benefits of being an early backer:</strong><br/>Of course there are intangibles - you'll have my deepest appreciation, and the good feeling that comes from supporting creative projects. But you'll also be among the first to receive the Tudor Planner when it arrives and ships. </p>
<p>Plus, the cost of the Tudor Planner will go up considerably after this funding period is over. The retail price is $39.95, and it will stay there until I discount any that are left in March, 2021. </p>
<p>Also, you'll guarantee that you get one. I print a limited amount, and previous years have sold out.</p>

<br/>June 19 Quick Update (and stretch goals):</h3>
<p>I'm completely blown away by the outpouring of support for the Tudor Planner, and I'm so incredibly grateful to everyone who supported the project so far! I wanted to add in a few stretch goals and bonuses as we enter the home stretch of the final 9 days! <br/><br/><i>First off, if we hit $30,000</i> all backers, no matter what level, will receive several<strong> Tudor themed printable to-do lists and daily planners </strong>that you can print out at home (or use on your device). <br/><br/><i>If we hit $35,000</i> all backers will also get a <strong>Tudor rose laptop sticker</strong> AND a pad of <strong>Tudor themed sticky notes. </strong><br/><br/><strong>If you haven't yet shared the project, please do so, and let's smash the stretch goals! </strong></p>
<h3>
<br/>Meet Heather (aka the Backstory)</h3>
<p>I've been writing and talking about history since 1991 when I started a summer job at a Revolutionary War museum when I was in high school. In 1998 I built my first history website, on Colonial America. And in 2009 I started the Renaissance English History Podcast, which makes it one of the longest continuously running indie history podcasts. Since then I've spoken about podcast community building at writers conferences, and at conferences including the Sound Education conference at Harvard.</p>
<p>In late 2016 I created the 2017 Tudor Planner,  which was a mix of two of my favorite things - Tudors and planning! It's a weekly/monthly planner that brings together history with planning - something that I definitely need as a busy mom with a young kiddo. I've always loved planners, since I bought my first Ziggy assignment book in 1989 - I color coded my assignments with Crayola skinny markers in Bold colors.</p>
<p><strong>Here's the cover from the 2017 Tudor Planner - the very first one:</strong></p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590677993/wqojr82x38j5ko4hkp9y.png"" src=""""/></h3>
<p><strong>It was one of those things that I wanted to create basically so that I could buy it.</strong> I thought it would be fun, and I might sell a few dozen. But that first one was way more successful than I ever imagined, and for the 2018 one, I worked with a custom printer. I've been working with the same printer since then, and this year I'm updating the design, and adding more planning tools and stickers.</p>
<p><strong>The Tudor Planner is a gorgeous book that will lead to people wandering by your desk just to check it out, and will cause spontaneous conversations whenever you take it out :)</strong>  Because each planner is a unique work of art. It's like having art, history, and planning all wrapped up in one. I mean, what else is there!?</p>
<p><i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">This will be the 5th year that I've created the Tudor Planner, and I rely on these IndieGoGo fundraisers to pay for the printing and distribution - this is all an independent project that I do on my own - there is no publisher involved other than me. So I rely on your support to bring this planner to life each year. </span></i></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why I'm Running this IndieGoGo (aka, the expenses)</span></h3>
<p>The main expense for the Planner is printing.  But I am also updating the design of the pages this year, requiring the skill of a designer. Plus the cover image requires the purchase of a high res photo that can run into several hundred dollars, and a designer to make it all look great! Then there is warehousing the books at a location in Maryland, and that's where they are packaged and shipped from.</p>
<p><strong>Every bit raised will be put towards that work, and the project will happen whether the goal is reached or not. </strong></p>
<p>The perks I'm offering include all kinds of great stuff, including a digital-only copy of the planner, a new activity book on the Six Wives, gift cards from my shop (TudorFair.com), a podcast episode on a topic of your choice, and tickets to the 2021 Tudorcon (plus the 2020 Virtual Tudorcon). The planners themselves will be shipped around the end of November, in time for the holidays. This is also the lowest price that the planner will be until I discount whatever is left in March of 2021. So hop on now to get the best deal, AND Tudorific perks!</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Impact (I mean, WHY does anyone want a Tudor Planner?):</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>I'm going to be totally honest here, and share that <i>I actually considered not doing the Tudor Planner this year</i>. The world seems like it's going crazy - between the economy and the pandemic, plus killer hornets thrown in on top of it all. I mean, is anybody even interested in getting a Tudor Planner right now? I thought that maybe I would skip this year entirely. But I polled some listeners, and people on my mailing list, and what I found was that yes, people actually did still want a Tudor Planner! And as I thought more about it, I became more excited.</p>
<p><strong>Because maybe now is actually the best time for a Tudor Planner</strong>. Maybe now it's more important than ever to connect with the people of the past - especially the Tudors who endured summer after summer of plague and sweating sickness and economic uncertainty - and find within that our common humanity. Maybe now, in the midst of a pandemic and political arguments, now is the time to find ourselves in the people who came before, in their stories, and sew a connection that spans centuries. And by doing that, we might be able to sew deeper connections within our own communities. </p>
<p><i>And then of course there's also the idea that when we manage our lives with a planner that helps keep everything organized, the chaos seems a little less scary. </i></p>
<p>So yes, it's a crazy time, and because of that I'm also adding in a special perk I've never done before, the<strong> Digital perk for those who want to support the project and get a Tudor Planner of their own</strong>, but just don't have the budget for the full copy right now. That perk will receive a digital copy of the planner that can be printed out at home, or imported into a note taking app like GoodNotes. </p>
<p>I always say that I'm a storyteller who makes history accessible because I believe it's a pathway to understanding who we are, our place in the universe, and being more deeply connected to our own humanity. And I try to do that in a physical way with the Tudor Planner each year. </p>
<p>That sounds pretty heavy for a planner, right? <i>Who knew that a planner could have such a deep meaning?</i>  You just want to track your habits and remember your appointments. But for me, writing out our lives like that is actually kind of sacred, because who knows who will find it in several hundred years, and piece together stories of our own lives from the record we leave in our journals and calendars? </p>
<h3><strong>A couple of bonuses:</strong></h3>
<p>Every backer will receive access to<strong> two short courses I did a few years ago on Kick@ss Women in Tudor England as well as Pregnancy and Childbirth in Medieval and Tudor England.</strong> Many of you will already have access to those when I sent them out to the mailing list earlier this year, but if you are new to me and my work, they have been really well received, and were incredibly interesting to research. I'll send out the link each week to new backers.</p>
<p>I'll also send you the list to all the <strong>videos of previous Tudor Summits</strong> that I did, starting back in 2017. These were online events that happened every six months for two years featuring leading Tudor authors and historians. I don't do them anymore because of my focus on Tudorcon planning, but there are over 35 talks filled with everything from visiting Tudor London to digging deeper into Mary Tudor. Again, once a week I'll send out a PDF with all the links to all backers. <br/> </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is the 5th time I've published a Tudor Planner, so things are a lot more clear now than they've been in the past, but there are always underlying risks. The printer could drop the ball, or the shipment could get delayed and stuck in customs. But since I'm using the same printer I've used for the past three years, and on pretty much the same schedule as before, I'm not anticipating any issues around that. </p>
<p>Of course, if you're not happy with the planner, I will do my best to make it right for you. Last year we had more printing errors than normal, and when I asked the printer about it, they told me they had switched to a different plant because demand was high. They assured me that this year they will be back in the original plant, so those errors shouldn't happen. We did send replacement copies to anyone who found an error. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute (or you just don't really care about planners, but you want to support the podcast anyway) I would love any and all shares of this campaign! Let's get the word out to other Tudor history lovers - or planner lovers who also love history! - and let everyone know that the world just got a LOT more Tudorific, and they can add a dash of history to their lives every day of the year with the 2021 Tudor Planner!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to consider supporting the Tudor Planner, and for those of you who do support it, I want to add an extra big Thank You. </p>

<div><h3>Summon the Summary!</h3></div>
<div>
<p>A blessing or a curse?</p>
<p>Trinia wakes up on her 16th birthday to find she can duplicate herself in mind and body, and the implications of her power spells doom for her people.</p>
<p>Her power-hungry father, Chieftain Caderyn, plans to use her gifts to create an army large enough to conquer the world, starting with her people. She goes on the run to seek out someone, anyone, who she can stand with to fight against him.</p>
<p>Deep in the Forest of Nex she finds Údar, a man of legend, who she hopes to convince to help her stop her father before it’s too late.</p>
<p>But when the ancient darkness of the Banshee Queen begins to rise and Trinia encounters far worse evil than her father, it becomes harder and harder to ignore the ancient prophecy that sealed her fate before she was even born.</p>
<p>That she will destroy the world.</p>
</div>
<h3>About the Book</h3>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Stephen Howard, and I am the author of <i>The City of Snow and Stars</i>. When I sat down to write this book, it was supposed to be one book. I told myself I was going to keep things simple, nothing crazy like I had tried to do in the past... Now, it's a planned Trilogy. Least I can say is that I tried.<br/><br/>One reason I wrote this book is that, as a Christian, I’ve been faced with hard questions that I didn’t have answers for. Why does God let bad things happen? Why are people abused? What does it mean to follow God when everything is going wrong? Questions I've asked myself countless times and wanted to explore and discover for myself.<br/><br/>These are tough topics to address on a good day, let alone write them into a book! Funny thing was, the characters of Trinia, Údar, and others seemed to write themselves and I was just along for the ride. They each share a common hurt from my past, but the way they processed and handled it differently made them uniquely their own person. In the end, I found more of them in me than me in them.<br/><br/>I love these characters and have spent countless hours with them (they are a rowdy bunch) and now I get to share them with you. I hope that in reading this book you will discover the pieces of the flawed and broken characters who are looking for the answers in yourself the same as I did. Their story is our story in so many ways because the truth is this: we are all a little broken.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy characters that are relatable, broken, imperfect, and human. They are flawed in so many ways, each one searching for something and not knowing fully what it is. They want to be loved, cherished, powerful, perfect, successful and seen for their merits. They, like us all, seek to overcome the pains we’ve gone through and find something better.<br/><br/>The City of Snow and Stars speaks to young adults and those in their early to mid-twenties who want to grapple with why God lets bad things happen and how we can address not only our brokenness but reach out in love to those who are broken.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that The City of Snow and Stars inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions that help us understand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why we cannot make it ""going it alone""</li>
<li>How our brokenness comes in many different shapes</li>
<li>And how, in the end, God can bring forth beauty from pain</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing God, abuse (be it physical, sexual, emotional, or mental), and slavery (human trafficking) in new ways that will change us all for the better.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>Welcome to My World</h3></div><div>
<p>The land of Wintenaeth is vast. Filled with majestic mountains, lush valleys, craggy shorelines, and wild forests, and is called home to no less than five kingdoms. It's a land filled with variety, bounty, and promise. A land where all peoples share in the magic and power gifted to them by Elohai, though now seldom use it. </p>
<p>But it was not always so. Ruins from bygone eras rise from the mists in each of the five kingdoms, a reminder to the brutal past under the reign of the Airgid Empire over a thousand years ago. A time when darkness held the land captive.</p>

A blessing or a curse?
Trinia wakes up on her 16th birthday to find she can duplicate herself in mind and body, and the implications of her power spells doom for her people.
Her power-hungry father, Chieftain Caderyn, plans to use her gifts to create an army large enough to conquer the world, starting with her people. She goes on the run to seek out someone, anyone, who she can stand with to fight against him.
Deep in the Forest of Nex she finds Údar, a man of legend, who she hopes to convince to help her stop her father before it’s too late.
But when the ancient darkness of the Banshee Queen begins to rise and Trinia encounters far worse evil than her father, it becomes harder and harder to ignore the ancient prophecy that sealed her fate before she was even born.
That she will destroy the world.

About the Book
Hello everyone, my name is Stephen Howard, and I am the author of The City of Snow and Stars. When I sat down to write this book, it was supposed to be one book. I told myself I was going to keep things simple, nothing crazy like I had tried to do in the past... Now, it's a planned Trilogy. Least I can say is that I tried.One reason I wrote this book is that, as a Christian, I’ve been faced with hard questions that I didn’t have answers for. Why does God let bad things happen? Why are people abused? What does it mean to follow God when everything is going wrong? Questions I've asked myself countless times and wanted to explore and discover for myself.These are tough topics to address on a good day, let alone write them into a book! Funny thing was, the characters of Trinia, Údar, and others seemed to write themselves and I was just along for the ride. They each share a common hurt from my past, but the way they processed and handled it differently made them uniquely their own person. In the end, I found more of them in me than me in them.I love these characters and have spent countless hours with them (they are a rowdy bunch) and now I get to share them with you. I hope that in reading this book you will discover the pieces of the flawed and broken characters who are looking for the answers in yourself the same as I did. Their story is our story in so many ways because the truth is this: we are all a little broken.You will love this book if you enjoy characters that are relatable, broken, imperfect, and human. They are flawed in so many ways, each one searching for something and not knowing fully what it is. They want to be loved, cherished, powerful, perfect, successful and seen for their merits. They, like us all, seek to overcome the pains we’ve gone through and find something better.The City of Snow and Stars speaks to young adults and those in their early to mid-twenties who want to grapple with why God lets bad things happen and how we can address not only our brokenness but reach out in love to those who are broken.Ultimately, I hope that The City of Snow and Stars inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions that help us understand:

Why we cannot make it ""going it alone""
How our brokenness comes in many different shapes
And how, in the end, God can bring forth beauty from pain

I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing God, abuse (be it physical, sexual, emotional, or mental), and slavery (human trafficking) in new ways that will change us all for the better.
 
Welcome to My World
The land of Wintenaeth is vast. Filled with majestic mountains, lush valleys, craggy shorelines, and wild forests, and is called home to no less than five kingdoms. It's a land filled with variety, bounty, and promise. A land where all peoples share in the magic and power gifted to them by Elohai, though now seldom use it. 
But it was not always so. Ruins from bygone eras rise from the mists in each of the five kingdoms, a reminder to the brutal past under the reign of the Airgid Empire over a thousand years ago. A time when darkness held the land captive.
After the fall of the Empire, the kingdoms rose to take their place:
- Canamor claimed the northeastern section of the Empire, from the Forest of Nex to the sea. It is slightly more advanced in its armor and weapons than any other kingdom, but lacks adequate farming and relies heavily on the sea. 
- Thydu claimed the northwestern portion of the Empire, and are a more hardy people. Known for their prowess with horses, it is their primary source of trade and extremely lucrative.
- Ungaar beat the others in claiming the heart of the fertile lands that once kept the Empire fed. Populated mainly by farmers, the kingdom is not defenseless as it boasts Qepho City, home of The Academy of Mages. Combined with their sheer numbers, Ungaar is quite the force to be reckoned with and is by far the most powerful of the kingdoms.
- X'phos made up the southern border of the Airgid Empire and is made up of free peoples who serve no one. Their strength is in the community and their wealth in the vine. It is also the homeland of the Iomliad, a people with shape-shifting abilities unique only to them.
The world is rich with cultures, peoples, and places, and I am so excited to share each of them with you all!

<p>We grew up reading EVERYTHING. As kids, we'd get Scholastic News in the classroom and every issue, there was something new and exciting. As we got older, we'd read Seventeen and Teen Vogue.

For teenage girls in West Africa, who face struggles such as low literacy, limitations on their ability to advance, and societal pressure that takes away their voices, a magazine is a platform--a platform for 11.7 million girls that can build community, foster a culture of reading, and improve women's outcomes.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> </span>

<p><strong>A review from a beta reader</strong></p>
<p><i>Zoetic Soul – Pertaining to life -by -Jan Mayfield</i></p>
<p><i>I was very skeptical about the subject of this book  partially “written in trance”. However when I started to read, it became very difficult to put down, with well described scenarios.</i></p>
<p><i>I became totally immersed in the subject and began to reflect on my own life my “Zoetic Soul” pertaining to my life.</i></p>
<p><i>It became very clear to me that we are on earth for a very short time, everything planned and set out for us before birth. We are here to learn and grow our souls from our experiences here.</i></p>
<p><i>I felt that each scenario was being passed on as learning experience for me and found it enlightening and intriguing.</i></p>
<p><i>I found this book a very good source of valuable information which would help everyone to have a glimpse into their own soul and learn from the experience.</i></p>
<p><i>At times I was mesmerized, with the rhythm of the tranced dialogue. </i></p>

A review from a beta reader
Zoetic Soul – Pertaining to life -by -Jan Mayfield
I was very skeptical about the subject of this book  partially “written in trance”. However when I started to read, it became very difficult to put down, with well described scenarios.
I became totally immersed in the subject and began to reflect on my own life my “Zoetic Soul” pertaining to my life.
It became very clear to me that we are on earth for a very short time, everything planned and set out for us before birth. We are here to learn and grow our souls from our experiences here.
I felt that each scenario was being passed on as learning experience for me and found it enlightening and intriguing.
I found this book a very good source of valuable information which would help everyone to have a glimpse into their own soul and learn from the experience.
At times I was mesmerized, with the rhythm of the tranced dialogue. 
I recommend it highly as a very well written book. A very good read indeed.

<h3>PEN/Margery Davis Boyden Residency<br/>
</h3> <p>Last year, I was selected as the 2016 PEN/Margery Davis Boyden Wilderness Writing Resident. Originally designed as a 6 - 7 month residency, I have worked with the homestead owners to winter over in the <a href=""http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/rogue-siskiyou/specialplaces/?cid=stelprdb5305663"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rogue River Wilderness</a> and write for 1 year.  I won't have access to electricity, cell service or internet. During the winter, snowed in, I won't have access to the nearest town (2 hours away) or a grocery store. All donations will fund food stores and growing for those extra 6 months while I work on two major writing projects, a long poem and a novel, inspired by the ecologically diverse and preserved Rogue River Wilderness. By backing me, you will bring Western landscapes into your life and home. </p>

</div><div> <h3>The Risks<br/>
</h3> <p> While the only thing standing between me and good writing is myself, wintering over in the wilderness comes with unique challenges. I will not have access to a grocery store, electricity, internet or cell service. The Rogue River is home to black bear, cougar and other large predators with keen noses. In an emergency or unexpected illness, I will have to rely on preparation and resourcefulness.  I will need to cultivate a sizable winter garden, erect a portable greenhouse, and stock food stores for 7 months in case the winter is harsh and long. I will also need certain tools, materials and supplies. Every contribution makes this level of preparation possible:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>$2 – A packet of heirloom
seed stock<br/>
</li>
<li>$5 – A spade, gardening gloves, or
other necessary hand tool</li>
<li>$7 – A typewriter ribbon</li>
<li>$15 – A shovel, hoe or other similar
tool for cutting, tilling and planting</li>
<li>$40 – Wash bin, ringer, and
powder soap to do laundry</li>
<li>$90 – Fertilizer for about two growing seasons for half an acre</li>
<li>$100 – 10 gallons of kerosene to
power lanterns through winter</li>
<li>$125 – Jars, pectin, sugar, vinegar, citric acid and other supplies for canning and preserving food.<br/>
</li>
<li>$150 – First aid supplies and emergency preparedness<br/>
</li>
<li>$200 – A cord of firewood to burn for
heat for 2-3 months</li>
<li>$425 – Materials to erect a greenhouse
of about 48 square feet</li>
<li>$600 – Propane to power stove, alt.
lighting, and refrigeration for winter</li>
<li>$1,200 – Foods stores for a seven-month winter</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3>Backers Make It Happen</h3>
<h2>
</h2>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>America has a track record for cultivating some of the 
world's greatest artists, by investing in the arts. This residency lives
 in the artery of this tradition. By backing me, you provide 6-7 
additional months of time for me to work, study and dedicate myself to 
quality writing in an inspiring place. I don't view this residency as a 
vacation, or time off, by any means. I intend to work, to write every 
day, to study and to yield writing that contributes meaningfully to our 
cultural conversation. I have been doing this for some time now. I have 
earned a BA and MFA in English and Creative Writing, received 
fellowships from the University of Idaho and Centrum Foundation, and my 
work has  appeared in national publications including <i>Willow Springs, Lake Effect, Kahini Magazine </i>and <i>Boston Review.</i></p>

The Rogue River is home to black bear, cougar and other large predators with keen noses. In an emergency or unexpected illness, I will have to rely on preparation and resourcefulness.  I will need to cultivate a sizable winter garden, erect a portable greenhouse, and stock food stores for 7 months in case the winter is harsh and long. I will also need certain tools, materials and supplies. Every contribution makes this level of preparation possible:



$2 – A packet of heirloom
seed stock

$5 – A spade, gardening gloves, or
other necessary hand tool
$7 – A typewriter ribbon
$15 – A shovel, hoe or other similar
tool for cutting, tilling and planting
$40 – Wash bin, ringer, and
powder soap to do laundry
$90 – Fertilizer for about two growing seasons for half an acre
$100 – 10 gallons of kerosene to
power lanterns through winter
$125 – Jars, pectin, sugar, vinegar, citric acid and other supplies for canning and preserving food.

$150 – First aid supplies and emergency preparedness

$200 – A cord of firewood to burn for
heat for 2-3 months
$425 – Materials to erect a greenhouse
of about 48 square feet
$600 – Propane to power stove, alt.
lighting, and refrigeration for winter
$1,200 – Foods stores for a seven-month winter



Backers Make It Happen



 
America has a track record for cultivating some of the 
world's greatest artists, by investing in the arts. This residency lives
 in the artery of this tradition. By backing me, you provide 6-7 
additional months of time for me to work, study and dedicate myself to 
quality writing in an inspiring place. I don't view this residency as a 
vacation, or time off, by any means. I intend to work, to write every 
day, to study and to yield writing that contributes meaningfully to our 
cultural conversation. I have been doing this for some time now. I have 
earned a BA and MFA in English and Creative Writing, received 
fellowships from the University of Idaho and Centrum Foundation, and my 
work has  appeared in national publications including Willow Springs, Lake Effect, Kahini Magazine and Boston Review.


  
Special Thanks to the Team

First and foremost, Frank & Bradley Boyden, who live in Oregon. Without them, and their invaluable support for the arts, this residency would not exist.
Clinton Begley has built a life traveling waters between lands  with kayak and camera, and now he works on rivers in Oregon, where he brings people together in cooperation and stewardship of important and thriving waters.
John Daniel is an award-winning writer and editor of poetry, fiction, and nonfiction--and an advocate for the arts and artists. With PEN Northwest, he administers this residency. His book, Rogue River Journal: A Winter Alone, details his experience winter over in the Rogue River Wilderness. 
Peggy Christian is a book artists living in Montana.
Kayla Paisley lives and paints in Portland, Oregon.
Spence Palermo has 28 years experience in film and television production 
throughout the US, Canada, Latin America, Europe, Asia, the Artic and 
the Pacific. Clients include National Geographic, Discovery Channel, 
PBS, History Channel and a host of other non-fiction venues and private 
non-broadcast clientele.
Matt Parker resides in Bend, Oregon with his loyal companion, Murdock (a 
German Shorthaired Pointer). He spends every free minute mountain biking, skiing, climbing, hiking and enjoying the backcountry on his dual-sport motorcycle.
Laura Sievert spends her days doing commercial art but is most happy 
when getting back to ""messy"" art forms like drawing and sculpting. She's
 an avid outdoorswoman and is especially drawn to cycling, kayaking and 
hiking.  She is married and has one son who shines more brightly in her 
life than the sun, moon and stars all combined. She is currently living 
in Quincy, IL.
Jordan Sparrow is a national award-winning graphic designer and art director, and a dear friend of Eric Greenwell.
Loren Tracy is a Midwest transplant living in Portland, Oregon. He is a visual designer who loves music and the outdoors.

<p>Publishing is big business. But we believe in the small community of readers. Did you know Jane Austen's book, <em>Emma</em>, had a print run of only 2000?

<h3>Like many Andy is a current college graduate (SUNY Geneseo) working hard to balance jobs and does not have health insurance.  </h3>
<h3>My friend does not know I am campaigning for him and would never expect perfect strangers to help support him financially. He is an optimistic and kind person who goes out of his way to help and listens empathetically to the troubles and triumphs of his friends.</h3>
<h3>With this campaign I hope to raise enough money to cover his medical expenses, which as of now include an ER visit, ambulance ride, and follow up care. Let's wow Andy with our generosity and show him that not all dog owners are the bite-and-walk type!</h3>
<h3>Below is his story, as posted on Facebook, in his own words:</h3>
<p>""Dear World on Facebook:<br/><br/>Yesterday, I went for a run through Cobbs Hill Park and around the reservoir. On a humid day, around 1:30pm I was headed back to East Avenue. Running down Culver Road, I came up behind a guy walking his pit bull after crossing the bridge over 490. The pup was almost comically fat with an orange/red coat, and the owner roughly 5'10"", skinny, light skinned with 3-4"" brown hair, wearing a backwards turned baseball cap and sunglasses.</p>
<p>Between the off ramp and Harvard St I decided to pass the two on the grass to the right, between the sidewalk and a fence. I looked down at the adorable, waddling pooch, and as I did this it jumped up and bit me, tearing my shirt. I was immediately startled as it jumped up again and bit my left thigh. I fell forward to the ground as the owner restrained the dog. I got up, looked at him, and the first words that came out of his mouth were: ""Maybe you shouldn't sneak up on a pit bull.""</p>
<p>Feeling blood run down my leg, I looked through the sunglasses to where his eyes would be and asked, ""Are you serious right now?"" From a silver car stopped at the red light in lunch time traffic an onlooker yelled, ""Hey, I saw what just happened. Do you need me to call an ambulance?"" Another car, red, carrying two passengers, pulled up on the side of the road. One of them asked, ""Are you okay?"" and ""We saw everything that happened.""</p>
<p>I looked down at my shorts, a dark stain spreading across the fabric, and back up to the dog owner. He said, ""Maybe you should take care of your leg."" I looked down at my leg, peeled back my shorts and torn boxers, and saw a [chunk] of my skin missing, the wound spilling with blood. I looked up and said, ""Yeah, you're right (thanks, I wasn't sure of what I should do next),"" and asked ""Do you have a cellphone?"" He told me he didn't. I asked the two people in the red car the same question, and they drove off. The man in the silver car had already driven off, presumably with a green light.</p>
<p>I looked at the dog owner, and of course I wanted to punch him in the face. I looked at the dog, and all I could think was that if I called the police and pushed further, then the dog would most likely be put down. It's not the dog's fault his owner is, well... whatever you'd like to call him. So, I thought, ""Screw this,"" and walked the quarter or half mile to my grandparents house, left shoe filling with blood. The owner continued walking his dog, seemingly unfazed, down Harvard St.<br/><br/>After a brief, expletive filled walk, I called up to my grandmother and asked her to grab some water, her car keys and to bring me to the emergency room. After a few minutes, she appeared with my grandfather, taking a moment to put some ice in the water (gotta/God love her). Driving towards Highland Hospital, we came back to the same corner, where a RPD Animal Control vehicle was just pulling up. I got out and spoke with the officer, and filed a report. I have no personal information for the owner. She sat me down in some shade, and washed my wound with water as I drank a bit. I took an ambulance ride to the U of R Medical Center where I was treated...<br/><br/>...I've been told that if a pit bull bites at a person once it is likely to do it again. I hate the idea of the dog being put down, though it could be for the best. I wouldn't want a child or anyone for that matter to get bitten.<br/><br/>So all I can say now is, please, be good to your animals and be good to each other.""</p></div>","This campaign is to raise money for my friend Andy who was recently attacked by a pit bull while jogging in a public place, leaving him with a substantial amount of medical bills.

<p> </p>
<p><em>At last! A proper guide on how to deal with the ‘other woman’ in your partner’s life – his MOTHER! </em></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What is this project about?</strong></h3>
<p>‘Monster-in-law…and the Rest of Her Rotten Family’ is a must-read guide for any daughter-in-law (DIL) having trouble with her mother-in-law (MIL). A hilarious read, it is one of the bitchiest, most cleverly crafted, laugh-out-loud books of its kind; chock full of fast facts, short stories and full colour cartoons.</p>
<p>My name is Nicola Milan and together with my co-author (and mum) Judy Davies, we wrote and illustrated this book to help me heal from the dramatic and stressful breakdown of my engagement to my fiancé. Why did we break up? Because of HIS MOTHER. </p>
<p>To create this book we interviewed women dealing with a problem MIL, conducted extensive online research and drew on our own experience. We quickly realised that there are women all over the world struggling with a difficult mother-in-law and this book has been designed to help you learn what ‘type’ of MIL you have and how to manage her behaviour.</p>
<p>We have even covered other rotten family members you might encounter. You will learn how to deal with a lascivious FIL (father-in-law) or bitchy SIL (sister-in-law.)

Let’s Go!
 
At last! A proper guide on how to deal with the ‘other woman’ in your partner’s life – his MOTHER! 
 
What is this project about?
‘Monster-in-law…and the Rest of Her Rotten Family’ is a must-read guide for any daughter-in-law (DIL) having trouble with her mother-in-law (MIL). A hilarious read, it is one of the bitchiest, most cleverly crafted, laugh-out-loud books of its kind; chock full of fast facts, short stories and full colour cartoons.
My name is Nicola Milan and together with my co-author (and mum) Judy Davies, we wrote and illustrated this book to help me heal from the dramatic and stressful breakdown of my engagement to my fiancé. Why did we break up? Because of HIS MOTHER. 
To create this book we interviewed women dealing with a problem MIL, conducted extensive online research and drew on our own experience. We quickly realised that there are women all over the world struggling with a difficult mother-in-law and this book has been designed to help you learn what ‘type’ of MIL you have and how to manage her behaviour.
We have even covered other rotten family members you might encounter. You will learn how to deal with a lascivious FIL (father-in-law) or bitchy SIL (sister-in-law.) It is also a wake-up call to older women who are becoming MILs for the first time. Some readers may even recognise themselves as one of the MIL types!

The only reason that the dachshunds survived, was because Dexter built them a nest in the snow. Trooper had two hurt back legs, and Dexter had frostbitten ears. Many of the boys' teeth were rotten and had to be extracted. They were starved and had small frames and little bony tails. Dexter's nose is scarred the whole way up his snout from burrowing into the ground for shelter. <br/>
</li> <li>
<b>This campaign is important to me, an indie house, published author, because Trooper, Dexter's brother, is still receiving therapy for his back legs and is separated from us. Their story is unfinished, but together we can finish it. </b>Trooper receives acupuncture and swim therapy (through the kindness of donors such as yourself) to help him get out of his wheelchair and back to using his back paws again. I want Dexter, who assists my disabled husband, to be his brother's own therapy dog and save Trooper for a second time. </li>
<li>The other problem with rejoining the boys without your help: my husband has degenerative disc disease, and he will be receiving another operation soon. As you can imagine, the men in my life, by no fault of their own, need special care that is keeping us united but in separate homes. I am asking for your help today, the only way I know how, by using my talent, to back a product to completion. Not any product, but one that you can receive as a thank you with a larger perk below (hopefully soon). (Dexter will give you something for now, of course, while you are waiting). The book is half-written, but I want to write about the boys' recovery process. </li>
<li>
<i><b>Don't you want to hear about their happy ending? Limited donors of fifty-dollars or more can receive the book if we reach our goal (small perks to come promptly-SEE ""PERKS"" SECTION IN SIDEBAR FOR MORE DETAILS). </b></i>
</li>
<li>There is also great information in my book about rescuing a dog. The process, as you can read, has its ins and outs. The beginning of this book, thus far, is the <i>Marley &amp; Me</i> of rescue dog stories, and it should not be missed! All agents and publishers willing to back the book are welcomed to contact me.</li>
<li>Someday, we will also sell the book at our area events (for those who miss out on the perks with smaller donations of under fifty). We will use the donations we receive now, to supplement our own monies to help with Trooper's adoption fees, medicines, treatments, and our bills (as supplement pay to working my day job, as a hairdresser). Any money, if there is any leftover, will go to editing and promoting the book. The book sales will hopefully keep life going a little smoother. We will receive most of whatever our funding is at the end, so please give what you can. Spreading the word about our campaign is a plus!</li> </ul> <p><i><b>Will you rescue the rescuer a second time?</b></i> </p>

Not any product, but one that you can receive as a thank you with a larger perk below (hopefully soon). (Dexter will give you something for now, of course, while you are waiting). The book is half-written, but I want to write about the boys' recovery process. 

Don't you want to hear about their happy ending? Limited donors of fifty-dollars or more can receive the book if we reach our goal (small perks to come promptly-SEE ""PERKS"" SECTION IN SIDEBAR FOR MORE DETAILS). 

There is also great information in my book about rescuing a dog. The process, as you can read, has its ins and outs. The beginning of this book, thus far, is the Marley & Me of rescue dog stories, and it should not be missed! All agents and publishers willing to back the book are welcomed to contact me.
Someday, we will also sell the book at our area events (for those who miss out on the perks with smaller donations of under fifty). We will use the donations we receive now, to supplement our own monies to help with Trooper's adoption fees, medicines, treatments, and our bills (as supplement pay to working my day job, as a hairdresser). Any money, if there is any leftover, will go to editing and promoting the book. The book sales will hopefully keep life going a little smoother. We will receive most of whatever our funding is at the end, so please give what you can. Spreading the word about our campaign is a plus!  Will you rescue the rescuer a second time? 
Thanks for reading,

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For example, in the most extensive story of the collection, titled ""The Object of All Dreams"", the main character attempts to better his impossibly dire financial condition and get away from a no-end work he maintains due to needing to pay the bills for his already spartan-like style of living.

<h2><b>Illustrator</b></h2>
<b>
</b><p><b>The illustrator, and main associate of this project, is a very 
talented artist, Vaso, whose site you will likely love, and you should 
explore it at <a href=""http://vasodelirium.blogspot.gr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vasodelirium</a>.</b><b> In the same page you will find links to her accounts at DeviantArt, Youtube, Facebook and other sites.</b></p>
<b>
</b><p><b>In her own words, her description follows:</b></p>
<p><b>""I'm a (mainly) traditional illustrator 
from Greece and am here to share my ideas with the world. I'm highly 
inspired by the natural world as well as fantastic zoology, mythology 
and fairytales.
My dream house is a library or a lighthouse (heaven would be a mix of 
both!) and is placed in Ulthar. Always enjoy loosing myself in good 
comics and books with my sketchbook somewhere near to take notes or make
 doodles of my thoughts. I also enjoy leaving notes in my books and see 
them again every time i decide to re-read it.
I respect every form of life, with a tiny bit more attraction to 
felines.""</b></p>
<p>In her <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/VasoDeliriumArt/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook page</a>
 you can find some more of her works, including works in progress and 
information about her current work as a graphic designer for 
Athens-based publishing houses and as a freelance illustrator...

</p>
<p>Finally, I want to express my own admiration of Vaso. I can regard 
her as a friend, despite never -by now- having met her in person (we 
live in different cities... Thessaloniki and Athens). I do know that she 
likes my own work as well- she has read both The Chrysalis book and 
other works of mine- be sure to check the campaign's Gallery for more pieces of her wonderful creation...! <br/></p>
<p>She deserves to become more known, despite already being a very respectable young artist!

<p><br/></p>The following is the introductory chapter of the book, translated (placeholder translation) into English:
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>""Gray Walls""</b></p>
<b>
<br/></b><b>
</b><p><b>""It
was a noon during the middle of summer, which was of some importance
given the hot Sun allowed the opportunity to the staff -and the
patients- to have a walk at the great yard of the public mental
health hospital. I arrived on time to meet with one of the doctors
that I knew from days of old. The occasion for my visit was a
distinction awarded to one of my stories. I had promised to read it
to him personally, as I used to do in the past when we would get
together.<br/>My acquaintance, who worked there, gave me a tour of the
areas comprising his office and also of those other ones open to the
public, in the department which he has been administrating for a
short while now. “All the walls here are gray” he said.<br/>At
some moment, as we were still in his spacious office, sat comfortably
in our armchairs and having each lit a cigar, my acquaintance having
just recalled something of significance told me that I have to see
one more location.<br/>I accepted, only was saddened a little that I
should now rise from such a nice environment, and also have to
extinguish my cigar, but soon we were in the corridors, and there we
walked, him in front of me, and myself at the back.<br/>For some time
we marched in corridors which in equal distances were being separated
by doors with diaphanous glass in their upper parts, whereas other
doors to the sides of us- themselves not diaphanous- were leading to
places unknown to me. At last we reached the end of the floor. He
opened the final door- which also was not diaphanous and thus I had
guessed that it would be the door to a single room and not one behind
which there existed the continuation of the corridor- stood in front
of it, told me to “please, go on”, and as I went inside the empty
white room he closed the door abruptly and locked it... <br/><br/>Since
that time I remain here. From the window I gaze at the yard, below,
sometimes I shout but no one seems to listen to me. It has even
happened that I would deem that one had heard- such a development
perhaps not at all easy as those others were thirty meters below, but
I yelled with all my power- a group of patients which must have
belonged to the persons with mental disability raised their heads and
seemed to look at me, and this in turn caused me to cry against my
will...<br/>I am thinking of the betrayal by that person. To have
locked me here, where there exists nothing… Or rather at first I
thought there existed nothing, since at some moment – I supposed
that I was becoming crazy- I noticed a protrusion, white as well, on
the floor, and I neared it so as to assure myself that it was merely
a delusion. But it was not. It was a small white piece of
chalk!<br/><br/>From that time I am looking at the chalk, and the
walls, with horrible speculation. From that time I have moved away
from the walls, stay at the window, holding the chalk in my hand as I
stretch it outside towards the powerful Sun. Should I let this fall?<br/></b>
</p>
<b>
</b><p><b>
And
a thought devours me. That the walls outside of this cell were all of
one color. That if I neared, perhaps, the walls of the cell, if,
against all hope, I dared scratch a bit onto them with my hand, <i>the
color of the used-up and existent everywhere chalk would diminish</i>,
and then I would be forced to watch more carefully, the endless
series of letters on that wall, and then – how much do I fear it! –
to find scribbled, between other ones, even this very story which I
am now narrating to myself…"".</b></p>

<br/><ul><li><h3>
<b>An overview of the twelve parts of The Chrysalis and its original 162 pages</b><br/>
</h3></li></ul>
<br/><p></p>
<p>1) Gray Walls (the piece presented also in part #3 of this campaign!)</p>
<p>Gray Walls is geared to immediately create the sense that the book 
has a world of mirrors and facades, where not much can be certain to be 
deemed as what it may appear to be. 

</p>
<p>2) The Fault</p>
<p>This is a relatively large short story, dealing with a painter's 
strange fault, which makes him banished from Art School, and causes him 
to plot a way to return... The ""fault"" is about automatic and horrible 
movements by his hands while painting.</p>
<p>3) The Ceremony</p>
<p>A story about a dead body, and a low-rank police officer first on the
 scene, waiting for his superior to get specific orders. Or is it...? 

</p>
<p>4) Darkness</p>
<p>Possibly one of the bleakest (externally) pieces of the Chrysalis, 
Darkness is about a young student in England (more specifically The 
University of Essex), who develops a threatening fascination with a peer
 who has some horribly deformed body parts.</p>
<p>5) The Spider</p>
<p>The Spider is a story I wrote influenced by the eponymous movie 
(adapted from a British novel), starring Ralph Fiennes. However, in this
 Spider story, the protagonist is trying to commit suicide. A sinister 
web appears as a direct result of that decision.</p>
<p>6) The Object of All Dreams</p>
<p>The largest piece of this collection, and briefly described in this 
campaign already. It is a story about the world of Dreams, and the Abyss
 which opens in them. The story has a passage by ancient philosopher 
Empedocles as accompanying the title, however it could also be prefaced 
by Heraclitos of Ephesos apofthegm, according to which ""Most people 
forget all about thoughts they have when awake, much like they forget 
all about what they do or think in their dreams""...</p>
<p>7) At the top floor</p>
<p>A second story taking place in England, and the University I studied 
in. Actually, this is the only purely autobiographical piece of this 
collection. About a very dangerous progression of events, concerning my 
views about the very strange and potentially dangerous system of 
perpetually moving elevators of the 5-level Library of this University! 
Being 18 can be very bad for one's health! :)</p>
<p>8) The ultimate veil to be lifted</p>
<p>A quite large story focused on an imposing building in the city 
center, and the will of a student to get inside and witness if he was 
correct in imagining it features an internal garden. Also deals with 
painting, and the human form.</p>
<p>9) The Singular Attempt</p>
<p>One of the shortest pieces of the collection (larger only than the 
Gray Walls). This is a tale about being trapped in a deep well, or some 
similar empty pit surrounded by four walls, a metallic ladder, and a 
locked door.</p>
<p>10) The Chrysalis
</p>
<p>The piece which gives this book its title, and one of the largest 
ones in the collection. Also one of the darkest-toned ones, despite hope
 co-existing with the first pages (which can indeed be termed as very 
saddening). The story starts in a hospital's bed, where the narrator 
tries to examine- without being able to do so directly- if he suffered 
as much harm as he feared he had, and mumbles about ""the surgical 
operation"".
</p>
<p>11) The Landmine</p>
<p>The second largest of the stories. A series of police investigations 
triggered by the gruesome remain of a young person, found in one of his 
apartment's rooms. Apparently the dead figure had once believed that 
there existed some kind of landmine in the city, one which he might run a
 real risk of running into, while preparing to leave to a far-away 
location (or even a different dimension altogether?)

</p>
<p>12) The Untravelled</p>
<p>The final story of The Chrysalis, it is one written down as the notes
 in real time of a man spending time in the luxurious house of an old 
friend. At some time, though, he discovers that he cannot get out...

<br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The nine perks are named after parts of ancient Greek philosophy... They are of three main categories: <b>digital and physical commemorative artworks (three levels), inclusion of your name in the thank you lists of the published book, and physical copies of the books.</b></p>
<p>-Two perks involve receiving pre-published stories of The Chrysalis, in digital form<br/></p>
<p>-A special perk involves choosing an added language for some of the stories, to be printed alongside the rest.</p>
<p>-The Diogenes perk is one which is included in some later perks, but not all!</p>
<p>The entire list of perks, with detailed description for each, is available to the right of the screen! <br/></p>
<p>I am sure that Vaso and myself will have loads of fun with the feedback generated by sent perks... Already looking forward to that!</p>

<ul><li><h3>Where/how financial support will be spent &amp; plan for release of the end result!<br/>
</h3></li></ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p>List of costs<br/>
</p>
<p>a) Pay of a Native English speaker, professional translator, who will be translating the 12 stories plus any bonus pieces <br/></p>
<p>b) Costs of physical objects given (card and poster artwork, copies of the original book and of the Illustrated new version, shipping costs)</p>
<p>c) Paying for book as well as perk-tied illustration work by Vaso</p>
<p>d) Any funding asked by the Publishers, to allow for physical copies of the illustrated Chrysalis in English, initially of up to 200 physical copies</p>
<p>e) Unexpected other costs, shipping costs and campaign fees<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Analysis<br/>
</p>
<p>a) The original book has 162 pages, and the new edition shall have roughly 200 pages. Translating to English will cost around 1000 Euros (1130 US Dollars), depending on level of expertise of the English translator. It may be a little below or above that amount.</p>
<p>b) Each original physical copy of The Chrysalis has a market price of 13 euros, set by the Publishing House. While negotiating a better price in case of bulk shipping is realistic, this still means that (for example) 40 copies would cost at least 500 US Dollars. In general, any larger quantity (more use of that perk or perks past it) can stabilize the cost at that amount, so I think it can be roughly estimated here as being in the region of 500 US Dollars.</p>
<p>c) For the entirety of her work, Vaso has agreed to a fixed pay of 1200 euros (1370 US Dollars) in the case of a fully funded campaign ($5.000 or more raised). <i>Important note - despite being a bit gloomy!: In the (hopefully only theoretical) case the campaign is not funded nearly as much as to reach the region of $5.000, there is a larger flexibility with Vaso's pay, <b>and we both still are fully resolved to ship any perks promised </b>(apart from any involving electronic or physical copies of the New Chrysalis book, cause it would not materialize at that point).</i><b> </b><br/>
</p>
<p>d) The creation (print) of 200 physical copies of The illustrated Chrysalis book will require a co-funding of the project, on my part, in the region of 600-1000 euros. More crucially, due to the bilingual version's difficulty in the local market itself, thus being more of a risk to the publishers. The final price may be a little less than that, depending on the campaign's development, yet it is a realistic estimate... So, if it is roughly 1100 euros/ 1130 US Dollars.</p>
<p>e) Around 800-900 US Dollars reserved for any unexpected costs for translating, shipping costs for the perks, and campaign fees.<br/></p>
<p>This also makes provisions for myself of not over-extending financially while still focused 
primarily on this important project- which, indeed, for myself is a very
 considerable step...: Regardless of how a book does as an 
example of use of its own language, it is very true that the spread of 
ideas or of art only happens through the lingua franca of any time, being primarily English 
in the case of our own times.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

You turn around, towards your own world again, but take with you our thank you note!</h3></li></ul>
<br/><br/><h3>
<b>Ending notes, thank you for your support!!!</b><br/>

<p><br/></p>
<h4><b>Thank you so much for being interested in our campaign! We look forward to making this project, and are hopeful it shall be of a very high standard...</b></h4>
<p>We wish, in ending this presentation, to draw your attention again to the fact that both myself and Vaso shall do our best to send all perks not including the copies of the English edition, even if the asked amount ($5K) is not reached. We also mean to keep in touch, and look forward to any of your questions or messages! You can also contact me at FB if you wish...</p>

The book we want to create is based on the original edition in Greek, now to be elegantly illustrated with Vaso's brooding work and translated to English.

Info about the Chrysalis stories

The Chrysalis is a horror story collection, composed of twelve interconnected works.



The tales are about change, symbolized by the stage of metamorphosis inside a chrysalis. Metaphorically, the territory of alteration can also contain the vastness of an individual's inner world, and a motif in the stories is the unexpected - and often unnerving - manifestations of that internal Abyss that humans carry around- despite normally being oblivious as to its machinations.


A central theme of the work is the will- or need- to change, in order to survive. This personal will, however, can easily reveal just how little travelled is the environment ourselves- and the narrators of these stories- consider as their own; consider as known and easy to walk onto or form calculations about. 



For example, in the most extensive story of the collection, titled ""The Object of All Dreams"", the main character attempts to better his impossibly dire financial condition and get away from a no-end work he maintains due to needing to pay the bills for his already spartan-like style of living. He aspires to present nothing short of a firework of a success, by presenting a mathematical proof concerning one of the unsolved problems, and consequently live off the considerable cash prize attached to that solution...!



In his opinion he is nearing the stage where he can make a breakthrough. But then he is met with a most unexpected obstacle.  One not of this world. 



Bio notes





Author
My
 name is Kyriakos Chalkopoulos (Κυριάκος Χαλκόπουλος) and I live in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki. My main interest 
is art, and in particular the more unsettling types of it. I graduated 
from the University of Essex, in the 
UK, 
with a degree in Philosophy, and I work as a seminar creator for the 
municipality of Thessaloniki. Along with London, 
Thessaloniki is the core environment of the stories in The Chrysalis.


I 
also organize and present programs on classical literature (Kafka, 
Borges, Gogol, De Maupassant, Poe and others) and lately present some 
courses on modeling and animating -using the open-source program 
Blender. 


You can have a look at my page in the Greek Writers database, or visit my home-page for the Greek edition of The Chrysalis, on Facebook. You might even wish to see a couple of pics (from presentations of The Chrysalis, or my seminars in libraries) found in my Personal FB account.




Illustrator

The illustrator, and main associate of this project, is a very 
talented artist, Vaso, whose site you will likely love, and you should 
explore it at Vasodelirium. In the same page you will find links to her accounts at DeviantArt, Youtube, Facebook and other sites.

In her own words, her description follows:
""I'm a (mainly) traditional illustrator 
from Greece and am here to share my ideas with the world. I'm highly 
inspired by the natural world as well as fantastic zoology, mythology 
and fairytales.
My dream house is a library or a lighthouse (heaven would be a mix of 
both!) and is placed in Ulthar. Always enjoy loosing myself in good 
comics and books with my sketchbook somewhere near to take notes or make
 doodles of my thoughts. I also enjoy leaving notes in my books and see 
them again every time i decide to re-read it.
I respect every form of life, with a tiny bit more attraction to 
felines.""
In her Facebook page
 you can find some more of her works, including works in progress and 
information about her current work as a graphic designer for 
Athens-based publishing houses and as a freelance illustrator...


Finally, I want to express my own admiration of Vaso. I can regard 
her as a friend, despite never -by now- having met her in person (we 
live in different cities... Thessaloniki and Athens). I do know that she 
likes my own work as well- she has read both The Chrysalis book and 
other works of mine- be sure to check the campaign's Gallery for more pieces of her wonderful creation...! 
She deserves to become more known, despite already being a very respectable young artist!



A story from The Chrysalis






The following is the introductory chapter of the book, translated (placeholder translation) into English:

""Gray Walls""


""It
was a noon during the middle of summer, which was of some importance
given the hot Sun allowed the opportunity to the staff -and the
patients- to have a walk at the great yard of the public mental
health hospital. I arrived on time to meet with one of the doctors
that I knew from days of old. The occasion for my visit was a
distinction awarded to one of my stories. I had promised to read it
to him personally, as I used to do in the past when we would get
together.My acquaintance, who worked there, gave me a tour of the
areas comprising his office and also of those other ones open to the
public, in the department which he has been administrating for a
short while now. “All the walls here are gray” he said.At
some moment, as we were still in his spacious office, sat comfortably
in our armchairs and having each lit a cigar, my acquaintance having
just recalled something of significance told me that I have to see
one more location.I accepted, only was saddened a little that I
should now rise from such a nice environment, and also have to
extinguish my cigar, but soon we were in the corridors, and there we
walked, him in front of me, and myself at the back.For some time
we marched in corridors which in equal distances were being separated
by doors with diaphanous glass in their upper parts, whereas other
doors to the sides of us- themselves not diaphanous- were leading to
places unknown to me. At last we reached the end of the floor. He
opened the final door- which also was not diaphanous and thus I had
guessed that it would be the door to a single room and not one behind
which there existed the continuation of the corridor- stood in front
of it, told me to “please, go on”, and as I went inside the empty
white room he closed the door abruptly and locked it... Since
that time I remain here. From the window I gaze at the yard, below,
sometimes I shout but no one seems to listen to me. It has even
happened that I would deem that one had heard- such a development
perhaps not at all easy as those others were thirty meters below, but
I yelled with all my power- a group of patients which must have
belonged to the persons with mental disability raised their heads and
seemed to look at me, and this in turn caused me to cry against my
will...I am thinking of the betrayal by that person. To have
locked me here, where there exists nothing… Or rather at first I
thought there existed nothing, since at some moment – I supposed
that I was becoming crazy- I noticed a protrusion, white as well, on
the floor, and I neared it so as to assure myself that it was merely
a delusion. But it was not. It was a small white piece of
chalk!From that time I am looking at the chalk, and the
walls, with horrible speculation. From that time I have moved away
from the walls, stay at the window, holding the chalk in my hand as I
stretch it outside towards the powerful Sun. Should I let this fall?



And
a thought devours me. That the walls outside of this cell were all of
one color. That if I neared, perhaps, the walls of the cell, if,
against all hope, I dared scratch a bit onto them with my hand, the
color of the used-up and existent everywhere chalk would diminish,
and then I would be forced to watch more carefully, the endless
series of letters on that wall, and then – how much do I fear it! –
to find scribbled, between other ones, even this very story which I
am now narrating to myself…"".










An overview of the twelve parts of The Chrysalis and its original 162 pages


1) Gray Walls (the piece presented also in part #3 of this campaign!)
Gray Walls is geared to immediately create the sense that the book 
has a world of mirrors and facades, where not much can be certain to be 
deemed as what it may appear to be. 


2) The Fault
This is a relatively large short story, dealing with a painter's 
strange fault, which makes him banished from Art School, and causes him 
to plot a way to return... The ""fault"" is about automatic and horrible 
movements by his hands while painting.
3) The Ceremony
A story about a dead body, and a low-rank police officer first on the
 scene, waiting for his superior to get specific orders. Or is it...? 


4) Darkness
Possibly one of the bleakest (externally) pieces of the Chrysalis, 
Darkness is about a young student in England (more specifically The 
University of Essex), who develops a threatening fascination with a peer
 who has some horribly deformed body parts.
5) The Spider
The Spider is a story I wrote influenced by the eponymous movie 
(adapted from a British novel), starring Ralph Fiennes. However, in this
 Spider story, the protagonist is trying to commit suicide. A sinister 
web appears as a direct result of that decision.
6) The Object of All Dreams
The largest piece of this collection, and briefly described in this 
campaign already. It is a story about the world of Dreams, and the Abyss
 which opens in them. The story has a passage by ancient philosopher 
Empedocles as accompanying the title, however it could also be prefaced 
by Heraclitos of Ephesos apofthegm, according to which ""Most people 
forget all about thoughts they have when awake, much like they forget 
all about what they do or think in their dreams""...
7) At the top floor
A second story taking place in England, and the University I studied 
in. Actually, this is the only purely autobiographical piece of this 
collection. About a very dangerous progression of events, concerning my 
views about the very strange and potentially dangerous system of 
perpetually moving elevators of the 5-level Library of this University! 
Being 18 can be very bad for one's health! :)
8) The ultimate veil to be lifted
A quite large story focused on an imposing building in the city 
center, and the will of a student to get inside and witness if he was 
correct in imagining it features an internal garden. Also deals with 
painting, and the human form.
9) The Singular Attempt
One of the shortest pieces of the collection (larger only than the 
Gray Walls). This is a tale about being trapped in a deep well, or some 
similar empty pit surrounded by four walls, a metallic ladder, and a 
locked door.
10) The Chrysalis

The piece which gives this book its title, and one of the largest 
ones in the collection. Also one of the darkest-toned ones, despite hope
 co-existing with the first pages (which can indeed be termed as very 
saddening). The story starts in a hospital's bed, where the narrator 
tries to examine- without being able to do so directly- if he suffered 
as much harm as he feared he had, and mumbles about ""the surgical 
operation"".

11) The Landmine
The second largest of the stories. A series of police investigations 
triggered by the gruesome remain of a young person, found in one of his 
apartment's rooms. Apparently the dead figure had once believed that 
there existed some kind of landmine in the city, one which he might run a
 real risk of running into, while preparing to leave to a far-away 
location (or even a different dimension altogether?)


12) The Untravelled
The final story of The Chrysalis, it is one written down as the notes
 in real time of a man spending time in the luxurious house of an old 
friend. At some time, though, he discovers that he cannot get out...











What you get for helping/perks






The nine perks are named after parts of ancient Greek philosophy... They are of three main categories: digital and physical commemorative artworks (three levels), inclusion of your name in the thank you lists of the published book, and physical copies of the books.
-Two perks involve receiving pre-published stories of The Chrysalis, in digital form
-A special perk involves choosing an added language for some of the stories, to be printed alongside the rest.
-The Diogenes perk is one which is included in some later perks, but not all!
The entire list of perks, with detailed description for each, is available to the right of the screen! 
I am sure that Vaso and myself will have loads of fun with the feedback generated by sent perks... Already looking forward to that!




Where/how financial support will be spent & plan for release of the end result!


List of costs

a) Pay of a Native English speaker, professional translator, who will be translating the 12 stories plus any bonus pieces 
b) Costs of physical objects given (card and poster artwork, copies of the original book and of the Illustrated new version, shipping costs)
c) Paying for book as well as perk-tied illustration work by Vaso
d) Any funding asked by the Publishers, to allow for physical copies of the illustrated Chrysalis in English, initially of up to 200 physical copies
e) Unexpected other costs, shipping costs and campaign fees

Analysis

a) The original book has 162 pages, and the new edition shall have roughly 200 pages. Translating to English will cost around 1000 Euros (1130 US Dollars), depending on level of expertise of the English translator. It may be a little below or above that amount.
b) Each original physical copy of The Chrysalis has a market price of 13 euros, set by the Publishing House. While negotiating a better price in case of bulk shipping is realistic, this still means that (for example) 40 copies would cost at least 500 US Dollars. In general, any larger quantity (more use of that perk or perks past it) can stabilize the cost at that amount, so I think it can be roughly estimated here as being in the region of 500 US Dollars.
c) For the entirety of her work, Vaso has agreed to a fixed pay of 1200 euros (1370 US Dollars) in the case of a fully funded campaign ($5.000 or more raised). Important note - despite being a bit gloomy!: In the (hopefully only theoretical) case the campaign is not funded nearly as much as to reach the region of $5.000, there is a larger flexibility with Vaso's pay, and we both still are fully resolved to ship any perks promised (apart from any involving electronic or physical copies of the New Chrysalis book, cause it would not materialize at that point). 

d) The creation (print) of 200 physical copies of The illustrated Chrysalis book will require a co-funding of the project, on my part, in the region of 600-1000 euros. More crucially, due to the bilingual version's difficulty in the local market itself, thus being more of a risk to the publishers. The final price may be a little less than that, depending on the campaign's development, yet it is a realistic estimate... So, if it is roughly 1100 euros/ 1130 US Dollars.
e) Around 800-900 US Dollars reserved for any unexpected costs for translating, shipping costs for the perks, and campaign fees.
This also makes provisions for myself of not over-extending financially while still focused 
primarily on this important project- which, indeed, for myself is a very
 considerable step...: Regardless of how a book does as an 
example of use of its own language, it is very true that the spread of 
ideas or of art only happens through the lingua franca of any time, being primarily English 
in the case of our own times.


You turn around, towards your own world again, but take with you our thank you note!

Ending notes, thank you for your support!!!


Thank you so much for being interested in our campaign! We look forward to making this project, and are hopeful it shall be of a very high standard...
We wish, in ending this presentation, to draw your attention again to the fact that both myself and Vaso shall do our best to send all perks not including the copies of the English edition, even if the asked amount ($5K) is not reached. We also mean to keep in touch, and look forward to any of your questions or messages! You can also contact me at FB if you wish...

Finally, we want to ask that even if you cannot support this project financially, you can mention it to others, and help spread the word!",10.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Thank you so much for your time! My
name is Niki Breeser Tschirgi and I lived in Tok, Alaska from 1982-1992. I am a
stay-at-home mom of six (yes six adopted kids). That's another book for
another time. I have always wanted to publish so to be doing this right here
right now feels pretty amazing. I've been writing since the 7th grade and even
studied creative writing in college. I've had personal blogs over the years
mostly sharing about real life issues. My most recent one is available to read
at SpokandyLand.com. I also wrote for an on-line magazine called Blindigo while
living in Houston. Currently, I have a Facebook page called “Growing Up Alaska”.
You should check it out!<br/></p><p>Actually, my Facebook page is what
encouraged me to publish my book. Over the months of writing stories about my
childhood and posting old pictures I found that a lot of people connected with

am. I can’t do this project alone so I am asking for help from my friends,
family and whoever thinks this is a worthy project to support! My plan for the
money raised is to help offset the cost of publishing, printing, postage,
merchandise, etc. It will also help me get up to Alaska in the summer of 2015

<p>I've got some pretty great perks for those who can donate!
I'm kind of looking at this as a presale for my book. There are different

Alaska” car decal. Donate $25.00 and get a car decal and a book when it is published or donate $50.00 and get a signed book from me! The list goes on but I will have limited edition hoodies (Alaska state flag colors) ONLY for this crowd
fund. I’ve lined up some cool business donations, too!  If you are feeling especially generous, you
can have dinner with me in Tok (sorry you have to get there!) and a printed “thank

I’m hoping to reach my goal of $10,000 but if I don’t, funds will go first to

Summary</b></p>
<p>I am Mark Tremblay, a registered patent attorney. I’ve
worked on patents from smart
phones to paper making equipment, lightning protection systems to bar
code readers, wind generators to smart card systems:far, far too many technologies to list here! I really love learning how
all these new technologies work!</p>
<p>However, throughout my career, I have seen systemic
problems within the patent system that keep it from being optimal. Our patent system often hampers rather than
promotes emerging technologies. Unfortunately, the problems within the patent
system run deep, and typify problems permeating our entire political system. </p>
<p>I have suspended my work in patents to tackle the root problems in politics.
I have created a plan for a solution I call the IParty Democrats.  Below is a short summary of the IParty. If you would like to see more videos, download audio files, or see a <a href=""http://i-party.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/IParty-Outline.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">complete outline</a> of the IParty plan, please visit the IParty Website<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/iparty-democrats/edit/www.i-party.us"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>.

<p>The IParty creates an adjunct party within
the Democratic party, to avoid dividing the Democratic party vote and throwing
general elections to Republicans opposed IParty positions. The IParty joins elements of the Libertarian, Progressive, and
Green wings of the Democratic party to form a voting bloc capable of winning
primary elections. The IParty will seek to field candidates in all state and
federal elections, including areas conceded by the Democrats.</p>
<p>The
IParty structures itself as three democratic republics within three distinct
organizations to exemplify the reforms desired in other parts of society.  The IParty will
fight to reform government and corporate structures by adding internal
democratic, representative and constitutional elements. The IParty will
champion individual liberties by working towards a constitutional convention to
restore the eroded Bill of Rights, and enumerate additional rights. The IParty
will seek to increase economic equality by reforming corporate structures, for
example by adding members of corporate boards elected by employees, and
reforming the distribution of stock options. The IParty will work towards
improving our system of producing energy to mitigate environmental problems and
to create jobs in the U.S. Finally, the IParty will live by a set of core
principles to create a recognized brand trusted by voters.</p><p>

<h3>In a Nutshell</h3>
<p>If you've taken the time to stop by, you know that I moved to Chicago to study at The Second City and begin my acting career. The past year of study at this legendary training center has been absolutely everything I imagined and more, but God has been working in my life in ways I never would have expected. He used Second City to draw me here, but it didn't take long for me to realize that it was Soul City he had waiting for me once I arrived.</p>
<p>Soul City Church exists to lead people into a transforming relationship with Jesus, and after a year of being a part of this amazing community of people I have seen and been a recipient of this powerful transformation that is happening in this city. Words cannot describe how grateful I am to God for placing me amongst this incredibly faithful and talented group of people that is Soul City Church.</p>
<p>As if the blessing of being a part of such an amazing community wasn't enough, God chose to bless me with the opportunity to take part in Soul City's Leadership Intensive this summer. So that's what this campaign is all about! It has been my prayer that God would provide a way for me to devote my full attention to this Leadership Intensive so that I can receive everything God has in store for me there, and the area that is currently proving to be an obstacle is my finances.</p>
<p>Over the next 3 months, I will be working alongside and learning from some of the top leaders in the country, and by contributing to my campaign you will be a very real answer to a big prayer of mine! The ability to fully devote myself to what God is doing through this Intensive is something that will create an incredible amount of room for transformation and growth in my life that will then equip me to better understand just how I can best glorify God!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What's in it for Me &amp; What's in it for You</h3>
<p>$3,800 is a ridiculous amount of money! And because I'm asking you to contribute to this incredible number, I want you to know where your money will be going! Soul City has been very generous in providing a stipend to each of the proteges that will help with  some expenses, but it's not quite enough to meet the cost of living in Chicago. So here's a run down of the money:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,100- miscellaneous expenses: phone, internet, utilities, food, etc.</li>
<li>$1,000- security deposit and first month's rent for new apartment. My current lease is up August 31, and I'll need these funds for the costs involved with getting into a new place.</li>
<li>$380- giving. I'm trusting God to provide for me in ways that are absurd to me, and I want to make sure I'm giving back to him because he is good!</li>
<li>$320- Indiegogo keeps that. I love that this service exists, but unfortunately it's not free. The site will keep a portion of the monies raised.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to give back to you! There will be perks for each level of giving! If you look to the right side of the window, you should see the different levels and what you can expect!</p>
<p>And just so you're aware, if my ""Only God"" goal of $3,800 isn't reached by the end date set at June 30, your contributions will still be very much appreciated and well stewarded. God is faithful.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm so excited for what's happening this summer, and I want you to know what I'll be doing! So here's a little snapshot of what my life will consist of within this Leadership Intensive.</p>
<p>Each of the six Proteges (pictured above) have certain areas of ministry that will be his/her focus. Mine is, probably not a surprise to you, Student Ministry! One of the most exciting yet challenging aspects about the student ministry at Soul City is...there really isn't one. We currently have an incredible middle school small group that meets weekly, but it's on a small scale. And now we have the opportunity to really listen to God for what he has in mind for a full student ministry and how we can best make it happen!</p>
<p>Part of my role this summer will be to help develop a launch strategy for our student ministry, and I am so pumped about how God is going to be moving to make this ministry something exciting and different! I get a little emotional thinking about the ways in which Jesus will be impacting and transforming these students' lives in and through Soul City Students. This ministry is only going to add more and more ""Only God"" moments to what Soul City is already witnessing!</p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>It is my hope that you will be able to help out finacially, but another really big way you can help is to simply pray for me! Pray that God will provide and that I will trust in his faithfulness in the process. Pray that God will be moving in my life this summer as I learn to lean on him and to lead and love people well. Pray that God will be moving through Soul City Church to be a light to this city, and that he would open doors that need to be opened and shut those that need to be shut.</p>
<p>Another big way you can help is to share this campaign with others! Definitely share it with people who know who I am, but if you happen to know people who simply find joy in giving or praying feel free to share it with them as well!</p>
<p>Indiegogo has sharing tools for different social medias and such, but you can also copy and paste the link wherever you like.</p>
<p>So with that, I'll leave the rest up to God! Thank you so much for all your support!</p>

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>My name is Malcolm J. Brenner, and I'm the author of the 2010 novel <a href=""http://wetgoddess.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Realm of the Wet Goddess"">""Wet Goddess: Recollections Of A Dolphin Lover.""</a>  Before that, I worked for 20 years as a reporter, winning numerous awards.  Now I'm raising money to self-publish an important book about my childhood struggle in a weird, pseudoscientific cult.</p>
<p>""Growing Up In The Orgone Box: Secrets Of A Reichian Childhood"" is a 335-page memoir of the excruciating torture I suffered in therapy with Dr. Albert Duvall, a trusted compatriot of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Reich"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Wikipedia: Wilhelm Reich"">Dr. Wilhelm Reich.</a>  Reich was the 20th Century's maddest ""mad scientist,"" a psychiatrist who reduced all of human psychology to the orgasm, and who claimed to have discovered ""orgone energy,"" a cosmic life-force which only he and his trusted band of followers could detect, measure and control.</p>
<p>What Reich didn't know, or refused to see, was that his buddy Duvall was a sadistic serial pedophile who molested hundreds of pediatric patients in the name of giving them better orgasms!  I know, because I've contacted many of them, and we all share pretty much the same sad story.  Needless to say, ""orgone therapy"" was all crap back in the 1950's and it remains crap to this day. Reich died in prison in 1957, but he still has many devotees.</p>
<p>Indiegogo has requested a disclaimer: this book contains adult content, that is, vulgar language and graphic descriptions of sexual acts such as sodomy, fellatio, masturbation and bestiality.  If this material offends you, there are many other worthy campaigns out there.</p>
<p>Your contribution to my Indiegogo campaign will help me self-publish ""Orgone Box,"" as I have been unable to find an interested publisher, or an agent to represent me.  </p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get:</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I have written, illustrated and done the page layout for ""Orgone Box"" myself. A talented graphic artist has designed the cover.  I use a local printer, who does good work and gives me a great deal.  I need $1,000 to pay for the first print run of 100 copies, which will cost $750, and to pay the artist $250 for the cover.</p>
<p>For each $25 you contribute from the US or $50 from overseas, you will get as your perk an autographed trade paperback copy of ""Orgone Box"" directly from me.  It's that simple.  Any and all funds raised will go to printing costs, then to the cover artist. If donations exceed my request I will print and ship more copies. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>""Growing Up In The Orgone Box"" will expose Duvall for a pervert and Reich for the pseudoscientist he was.  Pseudoscience can drive out good science, because it tells us <em>what we want to believe</em> instead of telling us <em>the truth about our world.</em>  It happened to me, and I am convinced Reich's bogus ""orgone therapy"" also destroyed my family by making my parents' psychological problems worse instead of better.</p>
<p>I have a great track record.  ""Wet Goddess,"" my 2010 autobiographical novel about a human-dolphin love affair, has sold 950+ copies in 17 countries around the world.  People in the publishing industry tell me this is astonishing for a self-published, self-promoted book with no major publisher behind it and no advertising budget.</p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"">Other Ways You Can Help:</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Even if you can't contribute, you can help spread the word.  Talk about my book to your friends, your enemies, anyone you know who might be interested!  Discuss it on social media, your blog or in forums.  And be sure to use Indiegogo's share tools to pass the word on.</p>

""Growing Up In The Orgone Box: Secrets Of A Reichian Childhood"" is a 335-page memoir of the excruciating torture I suffered in therapy with Dr. Albert Duvall, a trusted compatriot of Dr. Wilhelm Reich.  Reich was the 20th Century's maddest ""mad scientist,"" a psychiatrist who reduced all of human psychology to the orgasm, and who claimed to have discovered ""orgone energy,"" a cosmic life-force which only he and his trusted band of followers could detect, measure and control.
What Reich didn't know, or refused to see, was that his buddy Duvall was a sadistic serial pedophile who molested hundreds of pediatric patients in the name of giving them better orgasms!  I know, because I've contacted many of them, and we all share pretty much the same sad story.  Needless to say, ""orgone therapy"" was all crap back in the 1950's and it remains crap to this day. Reich died in prison in 1957, but he still has many devotees.
Indiegogo has requested a disclaimer: this book contains adult content, that is, vulgar language and graphic descriptions of sexual acts such as sodomy, fellatio, masturbation and bestiality.  If this material offends you, there are many other worthy campaigns out there.
Your contribution to my Indiegogo campaign will help me self-publish ""Orgone Box,"" as I have been unable to find an interested publisher, or an agent to represent me.  
What I Need & What You Get:


I have written, illustrated and done the page layout for ""Orgone Box"" myself. A talented graphic artist has designed the cover.  I use a local printer, who does good work and gives me a great deal.  I need $1,000 to pay for the first print run of 100 copies, which will cost $750, and to pay the artist $250 for the cover.
For each $25 you contribute from the US or $50 from overseas, you will get as your perk an autographed trade paperback copy of ""Orgone Box"" directly from me.  It's that simple.  Any and all funds raised will go to printing costs, then to the cover artist. If donations exceed my request I will print and ship more copies. 


The Impact:
""Growing Up In The Orgone Box"" will expose Duvall for a pervert and Reich for the pseudoscientist he was.  Pseudoscience can drive out good science, because it tells us what we want to believe instead of telling us the truth about our world.  It happened to me, and I am convinced Reich's bogus ""orgone therapy"" also destroyed my family by making my parents' psychological problems worse instead of better.
I have a great track record.  ""Wet Goddess,"" my 2010 autobiographical novel about a human-dolphin love affair, has sold 950+ copies in 17 countries around the world.  People in the publishing industry tell me this is astonishing for a self-published, self-promoted book with no major publisher behind it and no advertising budget.
Other Ways You Can Help:


Even if you can't contribute, you can help spread the word.  Talk about my book to your friends, your enemies, anyone you know who might be interested!  Discuss it on social media, your blog or in forums.  And be sure to use Indiegogo's share tools to pass the word on.

Thanks in advance for your contribution, whatever it may be!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><em>Yoga Ph.D.: Integrating the Life of the Mind and the Wisdom of the Body <br/></em></h3>
<p><em><a href=""http://carolhortonphd.com/yoga-phd/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yoga Ph.D.</a> explores contemporary yoga from the unique perspective of a political science professor-turned-yoga teacher.</em> Like most Americans, Carol Horton started studying yoga in search of nothing more than stretching and stress relief. Over time, however, yoga revealed itself to be a powerful yet subtle tool for exploring her body, mind, and the connections between them in ways she’d never previously imagined possible. This caused her to wonder: <em>What is yoga, really? Where did it come from? Why has it become so popular? And what does it offer us, as individuals and a society?</em></p>
<p>In <em>Yoga Ph.D.,</em> Carol integrates her diverse experiences as yoga practitioner and social scientist to provide provocative answers to these questions. Contemporary yoga, she notes, is a paradoxically multidimensional practice, pursued for everything from physical fitness to spiritual transformation – simultaneously commercial and mystical, recreational and therapeutic, scientific and esoteric. To make sense of such incongruities, Carol synthesizes personal reflections on her own practice with a research-based analysis of yoga as a sociocultural phenomenon. The result is a book that breaks new ground by offering a sympathetic yet critical analysis of the promise and pitfalls of American yoga.<br/><br/></p>
<h3><em>Cutting-Edge Yoga Photography: Gritty, Inspiring &amp; Real</em></h3>
<p><strong>Sarit Rogers</strong> creates a photographic style that not only celebrates her subjects as the they are, but allows viewers to look at the world in a different, more realistic way. A yogi herself, she is dismayed by the pastel world of yoga photography, finding herself perpetually uninspired. When Sarit was contacted about  photographing the cover of <em>21st Century Yoga,</em> a floodgate of creativity opened. She was in her element, shooting something she loves, while supporting a practice that nourishes her recovery and soothes her mind. These images gave her the opportunity to create something authentic and tangible for anyone and everyone, regardless of their age, weight, gender, or race. </p>
<p>Sarit's work for <em>Yoga Ph.D.</em> and <em>21st Century Yoga</em> is a labor of love. She hopes this campaign will provide her with some of the financial support she needs to offset the creation of these shoots while also allowing her to purchase some new lights that will add to her versatility as a photographer. It would be wonderful to be able to take her shoots into more exotic places with more variable lighting situations that may be lacking in grounded sources of electricity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About the Author and Photographer</h3>

She served on the faculty at Macalester College, and has extensive experience as a research consultant specializing in issues affecting low-income children and families.

Non perché vogliamo salvare il teatro - 'il teatro sta morendo?' - chissenefrega, lo facciamo perché vogliamo sopravvivere noi” 
Come nasce il progetto



Ecco perché nel 2011 con quattro amici mi costruisco, in 6 mesi, un teatro. Sì, me lo costruisco proprio con le mie mani. Trasformiamo una vecchia tipografia fatiscente in un accogliente teatro: il Caffè della Caduta. 
Inauguro con il mio primo Live Show. Giusto per non dimenticarci che siamo vivi.
Un talk-show teatrale in cui si fondono l’esperienza di 15 anni di teatro di strada e la passione per la comicità sottile dello stand-up anglosassone. Tutto è Live, accade “qui e ora”, il pubblico è protagonista, niente e nessuno viene escluso a priori.  Si crea ogni sera uno spettacolo inedito. Scritto e riscritto, ogni volta diverso. 
In due anni ho raccolto storie, temi, racconti che vorrei far diventare un libro. Un tascabile interattivo, un live show portatile, un antidoto contro l'infelicità. Un Libro LIVE.
Làsciati guidare dall'umore del momento, segui le aspirazioni di giornata per addentrarti in uno dei tre percorsi: 
Alive. Esiste solo un luogo dove la sopravvivenza è possibile. Riuscirai a trovarlo?
Love. Euforici incontri, (in)solite perversioni inseguendo il vero amore. 
Life. Incontri con uomini straordinari che cambiano una vita. Nel bene e nel male.
""La sopravvivenza del teatro sta al luogo come quella del libro al non luogo""
                                                           Jean Baptiste Sophiste 
Di che cosa ho bisogno



L'obbiettivo è quello di raccogliere 3200€ per la realizzazione materiale del libro: progetto grafico di copertina, impaginazione e sezione fotografica; la parte di editing che richiede la competenza di un editor, appunto, in grado di aiutarmi nella stesura del libro. Infine i costi di stampa per una tranche di 500 copie. La vostra ricompensa!


Perchè sostenermi?  
Non solo per avere una copia del libro, ma per diventarne parte. E' questo il gioco in cui voglio coinvolgervi. Per renderlo Live ficcatevi dentro. Nel modo che più vi rispecchia. Non prendetevi troppo sul serio e decidete se essere il personaggio che muore nel capitolo Alive o quello di cui mi innamoro nel capitolo Love. Alcune ricompense avranno bisogno di essere personalizzate. Scrivetemi direttamente a francesco.giorda@fastwebnet.it

<h3>Qui ?</h3>
<p>Je suis Pascal Nuti, 46 ans, passionné d'écologie, fervent acteur de l'efficacité énergetique et à son service depuis 20 ans.</p>
</div>
<h3>L'objectif</h3>
<p>Je lance ce projet pour aider Naoufel, 30 Ans, tunisien, un entrepreneur bio ethique en tunisie.</p>
<p>Les contreparties sont livrées sous la forme de flacons d'huile de figue de barbarie pure et bio, 100% premier pressage à froid, un miracle anti-rides que nous offre dame nature. Ce produit est aussi trés utile pour tous problèmes de peau : acné, rougeurs, irritations, vergetures etc..</p>
<p>Le montant minimum de 30000€ sera réparti entre trois personnes : Pascal Nuti, Naoufel et Ramzi, qui fait actuellement la production sur sidi bouzid, dans le sud de la Tunisie. Naoufel s'engage à financer son équipement avec ce financement, Ramzi fera vivre sa famille.</p>
<p>Comme Ramzi est déja en production, tout montant financé pourra être positif, et l'opération est donc validée par avance, il n'existe pas de risque autre que le ciel nous tombe sur la tête...</p>
<div>
<h3>Les retombées</h3>
<p>L'impact est énorme, nous réussissons ensemble une des premières levées de fonds qui, non contente de permettre de créer une entreprise dans un pays qui en a cruellement besoin, permet de payer les acteurs ruraux le double du prix du marché (et oui !), tout en bénéficiant d'un produit doté d'une pureté unique, le tout sans intermédiaire à un prix 40% inférieur au marché !!!!</p>
<p>Je dirige un autre projet le plus clair de mon temps sur place, et donnerais un coup de main aux équipes, tout en gardant un regard acéré sur la qualité du produit final.</p>
<p>A partir de l'automne, Naoufel se concentrera sur d'autres produits bio, éthiques, et locaux, sa gamme s'élargira afin de pouvoir financer une activité étalée sur toute l'année. Vous entrez ainsi dans une aventure dont vous serez l'acteur, ainsi que le membre : une base de données vous permettra de profiter de tous les lancements de produits, avant leur récolte, toujours à des tarifs plus bas que le marché : nous ne payons pas d'aggios à notre banquier, pas de dailly, et nous payons malgré tout, grâce à vous, tous nos partenaires cash. Par ailleurs, aucun réseau de distribution n'est requis, grâce à Indiegogo. </p>
<p>Des dizaines de personnes vont pouvoir retrouver un peu de dignité grâce à ces fioles magiques : 1000kg de figues de barbarie pour un litre d'huile, un million de graines à sélectionner, laver, presser, filtrer, mettre en bouteille, ça fait du travail.</p>
<p>Le lieu de production, entièrement alimenté en énergie photovoltaique, est situé au bord du lac Ichkeul, patrimoine Unesco.</p>
<p>L'utilisation est très simple : il faut en passer un film d'huile sur la peau le soir, avant de dormir. Attention, cette huile ne protège pas des UV, une bonne huile solaire est toujours utile pour faire bronzette.</p>

<p><span>Help Naoufel, 30 Ans, tunisian, a bio ethic entrepreneur in north Tunisia. With benefits, he will buy the material to press the seeds, filtering machine and so on.</span></p>
<p>The gifts will be prickly pear seed bio oil, fresh and pure, 100% first cold pressed, a miracle for your beauty and your skin, the most active natural product you can find against aging of skin.</p>
<p>The minimal amount of 30000€ will be shared beetween three peoples : Pascal Nuti, Naoufel and Ramzi, who is actually doing the pricky pear seed oil extraction on sidi bouzid, in south Tunisia. Naoufel will buy equipment to make same thing in north, and Ramzi will is happy to help us and use his machines to make some money .</p>
<p>As Ramzi is already producing, every gifts will be devlivered , even if we don't reach the 30000€ goal, there is so no risk of failure for this project ...</p>
<div>
<h3>Impact</h3>

You are so beguning an adventure where you are an actor, and a menber : A database will permit you to have offers, before the harvest date, always at prices under the market : we have nothing to pay to our bank, no debs, but we pay cash all our partners, often two times the marlket price. BTW,due to indiegogo, we need no costly distribution networ. </p>
<p>A lot of poor peoples will have benefit from this action : 2000 LBS of pricky pear are needed to produce onmy a liter of oil, one million of seed to select, wash, press, filter, store, this is a lot of job.</p>
<p>The production site will be situated 1km far from the ichkeul lake, unesco heritage classified.</p>
<p>Using the oil is very simple : you have only to coat your face before sleeping. Be carefull, this oil don't protect from UV and sun, use regular sun oil for protect skin outdoor.</p>

<p><i>Let Them Stay</i> is a book of oral histories, public statements, and personal narratives of U.S. War Resisters in Canada from 2004 to the present.</p>
<p>Long before Chelsea (Bradley) Manning released the Iraq War logs and the Collateral Murder video, Canada had its own WikiLeaks in the embodied form of the American soldiers who fled to Canada seeking refuge from the UN-deemed illegal war in Iraq. Now, after an almost decade-long struggle to stay in Canada, their stories and related documents have been collected in one place: <em>Let Them Stay, </em>the book.</p>
<p>These stories are vital to understanding how the politics of war changed the lives of men and women who had valiantly served their country but whose consciences would not allow them to continue to fight. Did you oppose the Iraq War? So did these US soldiers. By contributing to <em>Let Them Stay, </em>you will help document the sacrifices made by these brave men and women fighting to stay in Canada.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need:</strong></h2>
<p>With many War Resisters and activists volunteering time and talent to <em>Let Them Stay</em>, our supportive publisher, Iguana Books (<a href=""http://iguanabooks.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://iguanabooks.com/</a>), has managed to keep production costs low. Among others, a professional editor, a professional graphic artist, and a professional videographer have all donated their time to getting this book launched.</p>
<p>Even with all the unpaid time and effort that have gone into the making of this book, we still need to secure funding for some aspects of production, marketing, promotion, and on-line world-wide distribution for eBook and print. The total budget for this campaign is $6500.</p>
<p>We would like to see the campaign exceed that goal so we can make a donation to the War Resisters Support Campaign (<a href=""http://www.resisters.ca/index_en.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.resisters.ca/index_en.html</a>). Additionally, Iguana Books, Luke Stewart and Sarah Hipworth are donating the majority of the royalties to WRSC. This means that once <em>Let Them Stay</em> has been released, 85% of all sales will go directly to support the fight to keep conscientious objectors in Canada. Buying a book will help WRSC Let Them Stay!</p>

Based in southern Italy SuccoAcido lives in Europe and in the Mediterranean area but winks to other continents, because the goal is to publish in all languages of the world within the next 10 years. For 14 years the magazine represented a model of independent journalism. SuccoAcido features articles, interviews, reviews and events about art, cinema, comics, music, theatre and writing published in different languages. Our purpose is to let people cross several cultural circuits and languages in as many ways as possible.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/967500/files/20141028213920-succoacidon2.jpg?1414557560"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
<p><b>About this crowdfunding campaign</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>No advertorial. Our resources based on advertising or on subscriptions of those who want to distribute a free magazine that are the guarantee of our independence and our neutrality editorial.</p>
<p>SuccoAcido magazine needs funding for the next printed edition of 2015,
 as well as for the maintenance of SuccoAcido website and community, in 
addition to the developing of an app dedicated to our 
readers and distributors. SuccoAcido online digital edition is daily 
updated, the printed edition will be updated every 3/4 months.Besides all this, we want to extend distribution to many other countries now! <br/></p>Everywhere in the world, Culture should be the first investment for the benefit of all, but unfortunately it is not. Since we started, we have invested more than twice the amount we are asking today, but we continue to believe that there was no better way to spend our money in spite of the fact that it has never returned in our hands. We have reinvested in the magazine all that we have gained. We made our best but we cannot continue to support by ourselves such a complex cultural project that today requires more investments. If you believe that SuccoAcido is a useful resource for our brains, it's time to help us to go ahead! Join us untill the end of this campaign...<br/><p></p>
SuccoAcido editorial project helps you to think about the differences among peoples and own limits, doesn't it? It sounds like as a little manifesto of human complexity to be exported to other galaxies and worlds, doesn't it? We hope so... <br/><p>Remember: if you'll support SuccoAcido you'll support all those cultural networks that SuccoAcido have supported over the past years.</p>

Voilà pourquoi un crowdfunding: raconter une histoire de la presse libre et indépendante, et peut-être continuer...</p>

<p><b>À propos de cette campagne de crowdfunding</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Ni publireportage. Nos seules ressources reposent sur la publicité ou sur les abonnements pour ceux qui veulent distribuer un magazine gratuit qui sont la garantie de notre indépendance et de notre neutralité éditoriale.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Le magazine SuccoAcido a besoin d’argent pour continuer et augmenter le tirage et la distribution des prochains numéros de SuccoAcido 2015 en papier, ainsi que pour la maintenance du site Web et de la communauté de SuccoAcido et de plus pour le développement d’une application dédiée aux lecteurs et distributeurs de SuccoAcido. SuccoAcido édition numérique est mise à jour quotidiennement en ligne, l’édition papier sera mise à jour tous les 3/4 mois.</p>
<p>Nous voulons étendre la distribution dans de nombreux pays maintenant! Publié dans autant de langues que possible, SuccoAcido est un rare exemple de mélange des cultures et des circuits d’une manière très simple et inhabituel. <br/></p>
<p>Partout dans le monde, la culture doit être le premier élément de 
l'investissement pour le bénéfice de tous, mais malheureusement il n'est
 pas. Depuis que nous avons commencé, il ya 14 ans, nous avons investi 
lentement plus du double de la somme que nous demandons aujourd'hui et 
nous croyons toujours qu'il n'y a pas de meilleure façon de dépenser 
notre argent en dépit du fait qu'il n'a jamais retourné dans nos mains 
pour être réinvestis sur le magazine. Nous avons fait de notre mieux, 
mais nous ne pouvons plus continuer à soutenir par nous-mêmes un projet 
culturel si complexe qui nécessite en effet d'énormes investissements. 
Si vous croyez que SuccoAcido est une ressource utile pour beaucoup de 
nos cerveaux maintenant il est temps pour nous aider à aller de l'avant 
sur cette voie. Soutenez-nous en aucune manière possible, même lorsque 
cette campagne se terminera ...
<br/></p>
<p>Est-ce que le projet éditorial SuccoAcido aide vous à réfléchir sur les différences entre les peuples et les limites propres de chacun? Ne sonne-t-il pas comme un petit manifeste de la complexité humaine à exporter dans d’autres galaxies et mondes? Nous l’espérons ... Rappelez-vous: soutenir SuccoAcido signifie soutenir tous les circuits culturels que SuccoAcido veut soutenir.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>En particulier votre argent de la campagne de crowdfunding sera utilisé:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>pour IMPRIMER &amp; DISTRIBUER les nouveaux numéros de SuccoAcido 2015 en papier</li>
<li>pour DÉVELOPPER et MAINTENIR le site Web et de la communauté de SuccoAcido</li>
<li>pour DÉVELOPPER une application SuccoAcido très utile pour iPhone, iPad et Android</li>
<li>pour ÉTENDRE notre équipe pour les articles et les traductions</li>
<li>pour RÉALISER sacs et tasses de SuccoAcido, t-shirts et imprimer plus de cd comme avantages pour vous</li>
<li>pour EFFECTUER ET TOURNER « SuccoAcido Collective Readings » non-shows</li>
</ul>
<p>À la fin de cette campagne de crowdfunding (le 23/12/2014) si nous ne serons pas en mesure d’atteindre notre objectif premier, nous allons reformuler le projet de la revue avec une circulation moindre et avec seulement une ou deux numéros en 2015 au lieu de 4. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Plus tard, au début de 2015, nous allons peut-être lancer des campagnes de crowdfunding suivantes pour objectifs pas pleinement atteints et / ou pour développer une distribution plus étendue de la revue dans des nouveaux États et continents. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Si nous ne atteindrons pas notre objectif: employer notre équipe de collaborateurs est notre plus grand cible depuis toujours.</span></p>

<p><b>Aiutateci a stampare la nostra rivista multilingue internazionale, a distribuirla e a realizzare una app.</b></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p>14 anni, 3948 comunicati stampa in agenda, circa 1000 articoli e interviste, 24 uscite cartacee, più di 100.000 Euro investiti, 130.000 copie distribuite nei circuiti internazionali dell'arte, del cinema, del fumetto, del teatro, della musica, della letteratura. Sono solo numeri, nemmeno così tanto grandi, che non possono rendere l'idea del lavoro, della fatica e della gioia vissuti in questi anni.  Ecco perché un crowdfunding: per raccontarvi una storia di stampa libera e indipendente. E forse per continuarla...</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Cosa è SuccoAcido?</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>SuccoAcido è un giornale gratuito, internazionale e multilingue; un magazine con edizione <a href=""http://issuu.com/marcdedieux"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cartacea</a> e <a href=""http://www.succoacido.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">on line</a>; una <a href=""http://www.succoacido.net/rules.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">community</a>. Fondato nel sud Italia 14 anni fa, SuccoAcido vive in Europa e nel bacino del Mediterraneo, ma strizza l'occhio ad altri continenti, perché l'obiettivo è di pubblicare in tutte le lingue del mondo entro i prossimi 10 anni. SuccoAcido rappresenta un modello di giornalismo indipendente e raccoglie articoli e interviste, ma anche notizie dal mondo dell'arte, del cinema, del comics, della musica e della scrittura, pubblicate ogni giorno in tutte le lingue. La nostra ragion d'essere è far sì che le persone possano incontrarsi, incrociando virtualmente lingue e circuiti culturali del maggior numero di paesi possibile.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>A proposito di questa campagna di crowdfunding</b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Nessuna publiredazionale. Le nostre risorse basate sulla pubblicità tabellare o sugli abbonamenti di chi vuole distribuire una rivista gratuita che sono la garanzia della nostra indipendenza e la nostra neutralità editoriale.</p>Ovunque nel mondo, infatti, la cultura dovrebbe essere al primo posto negli investimenti pubblici e privati, per il bene comune, ma purtroppo non è così. Da quando abbiamo cominciato questo progetto, noi abbiamo investito di anno in anno più del doppio della cifra che oggi chiediamo e siamo convinti che non ci fosse modo migliore per spendere il nostro denaro. Tutto il nostro guadagno è stato infatti sempre reinvestito nel giornale. Abbiamo fatto del nostro meglio e con ottimi risultati, ma non possiamo continuare più a sostenere da soli un progetto culturale così complesso. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Se credete che SuccoAcido sia una risorsa importante, adesso è il momento di aiutarci a proseguire in questa direzione. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Supportateci in ogni modo possibile, fino al termine della campagna...</span>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Con questa campagna noi intendiamo lanciare un progetto culturale che si fonda su una proposta articolata: </p>
<p>1. da un lato vogliamo continuare a fare ricerca, presentare il punto di vista degli artisti, attraverso interviste e articoli su carta e on line, proseguendo e incrementando l'edizione cartacea del giornale e l'attività del portale web. L'edizione on line del giornale potrà ancora essere aggiornata quotidianamente e quella cartacea potrà avere una cadenza di 3 o quattro mesi.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>2. D'altra parte desideriamo anche estendere il nostro archivio e l'aggiornamento quotidiano delle news dal mondo della cultura internazionale sviluppando una app che tutti i nostri lettori, da qualsiasi parte del mondo potranno seguire scaricandola sui propri mobiles, smartphone e tablet.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>3. Inoltre vogliamo estendere la distribuzione a nuovi Paesi incrementando la lista dei nostri distributori e partners!!!! Pubblicato in tante lingue SuccoAcido è un raro esempio di incrocio di culture in un modo semplice, ma innovativo. Credete come noi che SuccoAcido aiuti a riflettere sulle differenze tra le culture, ponendo ciascuno  di fronte ai propri limiti? Vi suona come un piccolo manifesto della complessità culturale da esportare in altre galassie e mondi? Noi speriamo di sì...  Ricordate: sostenere SuccoAcido significa sostenere anche tutti quei circuiti culturali che la rivista sostiene da anni.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>In particolare i soldi che raccoglieremo dalla campagna di crowdfunding saranno utilizzati:</b> </p>
<p>Per STAMPARE e DISTRIBUIRE le uscite cartacee di SuccoAcido nel 2015</p>
<p>Per SVILUPPARE e MANTENERE il sito SuccoAcido e la community  </p>
<p>Per SVILUPPARE un app di SuccoAcido per iPhone, iPad e Android </p>
<p>Per ALLARGARE il nostro team per articoli e traduzioni </p>
<p>Per REALIZZARE le borse, le tazze e le magliette di SuccoAcido e altri cd per voi</p>
<p>Per LEGGERE E FILMARE insieme le SuccoAcido Collective Readings... </p>
<p>Il 23/12/2014, alla fine di questa campagna di crowd funding, se non avremo raggiunto il nostro obiettivo riformuleremo il progetto dell'edizione cartacea con tirature e periodicità minime e<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> nei primi mesi del 2015, lanceremo altre campagne di </span>crowdfunding<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> per sviluppare una più diffusa distribuzione della rivista in altri stati e continenti. Se invece raggiungeremo il nostro obiettivo potremo impiegare i nostri </span>collaboratori<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, è il più grande sogno di sempre.</span></p>

<p>Un ""SuccoAcido Collective Reading"" è un gioco sui media. Uno spettacolo dedicato a diverse scene culturali, un momento di confronto sulle tematiche politiche inerenti alla situazione dell'informazione e dell'editoria oggi. Lo spettacolo è incentrato sulla performance e sulla condivisione di pensiero, musica, parole. L'accordatura della carta e la lettura comune delle copie di SuccoAcido distribuite al pubblico sono l'avvio di un'esperienza corale e sempre diversa. In ogni città saranno invitati artisti diversi a intervenire sul palco. <br/>Il tour sarà filmato per realizzare il secondo road movie di Marc De Dieux (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sZ0hn9P4Ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pulp Critic</a>). Puoi ricevere a casa 10 copie arretrate di SuccoAcido per filmare 1 minuto della tua SuccoAcido Collective Reading con gli amici, poi inviaci il tuo video per far parte del film. Scriveteci prima di prenotare questo premio per controllare la disponibilità delle date. L'indirizzo è  sacr[at]succoacido[dot]net</p>

Aidez-nous à imprimer notre magazine indépendant, multilingue et international, augmenter la distribution, réaliser l’application.


14 années, 3948 communiqués de presse dans l'agenda, about 1000 articles et interviews, 24 numéros imprimés, plus de 100.000 Euro investi, 130.000 exemplaires distribués dans le circuit international de l'art, le cinéma, la bande dessinée, le théâtre, la musique, la littérature. Ils ne sont que des chiffres et pas si grande en effet, qu'ils ne peuvent pas vous redonner l'idée de travail, l'effort et la joie connu au cours des dernières années. Voilà pourquoi un crowdfunding: raconter une histoire de la presse libre et indépendante, et peut-être continuer...


Qu’est-ce que c’est SuccoAcido?


SuccoAcido est un magazine gratuit indépendant, multilingue et international en papier, une revue en ligne et une communauté d’art. Le magazine est basé dans le sud de l’Italie SuccoAcido vivent en Europe et dans le bassin méditerranéen, mais un clin d'œil à d'autres continents, car le but est de publier dans toutes les langues du monde dans les 10 prochaines années. 14 ans de journalisme indépendant en Italie.

Une première page de SuccoAcido dernière édition de onpaper (2012/2013 ans)


À propos de cette campagne de crowdfunding


Ni publireportage. Nos seules ressources reposent sur la publicité ou sur les abonnements pour ceux qui veulent distribuer un magazine gratuit qui sont la garantie de notre indépendance et de notre neutralité éditoriale.


Le magazine SuccoAcido a besoin d’argent pour continuer et augmenter le tirage et la distribution des prochains numéros de SuccoAcido 2015 en papier, ainsi que pour la maintenance du site Web et de la communauté de SuccoAcido et de plus pour le développement d’une application dédiée aux lecteurs et distributeurs de SuccoAcido.

Nous voulons étendre la distribution dans de nombreux pays maintenant! Publié dans autant de langues que possible, SuccoAcido est un rare exemple de mélange des cultures et des circuits d’une manière très simple et inhabituel. 
Partout dans le monde, la culture doit être le premier élément de 
l'investissement pour le bénéfice de tous, mais malheureusement il n'est
 pas. Depuis que nous avons commencé, il ya 14 ans, nous avons investi 
lentement plus du double de la somme que nous demandons aujourd'hui et 
nous croyons toujours qu'il n'y a pas de meilleure façon de dépenser 
notre argent en dépit du fait qu'il n'a jamais retourné dans nos mains 
pour être réinvestis sur le magazine. Nous avons fait de notre mieux, 
mais nous ne pouvons plus continuer à soutenir par nous-mêmes un projet 
culturel si complexe qui nécessite en effet d'énormes investissements. 
Si vous croyez que SuccoAcido est une ressource utile pour beaucoup de 
nos cerveaux maintenant il est temps pour nous aider à aller de l'avant 
sur cette voie. Soutenez-nous en aucune manière possible, même lorsque 
cette campagne se terminera ...

Est-ce que le projet éditorial SuccoAcido aide vous à réfléchir sur les différences entre les peuples et les limites propres de chacun? Ne sonne-t-il pas comme un petit manifeste de la complexité humaine à exporter dans d’autres galaxies et mondes? Nous l’espérons ... Rappelez-vous: soutenir SuccoAcido signifie soutenir tous les circuits culturels que SuccoAcido veut soutenir.



En particulier votre argent de la campagne de crowdfunding sera utilisé:

pour IMPRIMER & DISTRIBUER les nouveaux numéros de SuccoAcido 2015 en papier
pour DÉVELOPPER et MAINTENIR le site Web et de la communauté de SuccoAcido
pour DÉVELOPPER une application SuccoAcido très utile pour iPhone, iPad et Android
pour ÉTENDRE notre équipe pour les articles et les traductions
pour RÉALISER sacs et tasses de SuccoAcido, t-shirts et imprimer plus de cd comme avantages pour vous
pour EFFECTUER ET TOURNER « SuccoAcido Collective Readings » non-shows

À la fin de cette campagne de crowdfunding (le 23/12/2014) si nous ne serons pas en mesure d’atteindre notre objectif premier, nous allons reformuler le projet de la revue avec une circulation moindre et avec seulement une ou deux numéros en 2015 au lieu de 4. Plus tard, au début de 2015, nous allons peut-être lancer des campagnes de crowdfunding suivantes pour objectifs pas pleinement atteints et / ou pour développer une distribution plus étendue de la revue dans des nouveaux États et continents. Si nous ne atteindrons pas notre objectif: employer notre équipe de collaborateurs est notre plus grand cible depuis toujours.

Aiutateci a stampare la nostra rivista multilingue internazionale, a distribuirla e a realizzare una app.


14 anni, 3948 comunicati stampa in agenda, circa 1000 articoli e interviste, 24 uscite cartacee, più di 100.000 Euro investiti, 130.000 copie distribuite nei circuiti internazionali dell'arte, del cinema, del fumetto, del teatro, della musica, della letteratura. Sono solo numeri, nemmeno così tanto grandi, che non possono rendere l'idea del lavoro, della fatica e della gioia vissuti in questi anni.  Ecco perché un crowdfunding: per raccontarvi una storia di stampa libera e indipendente. E forse per continuarla...


Cosa è SuccoAcido?

SuccoAcido è un giornale gratuito, internazionale e multilingue; un magazine con edizione cartacea e on line; una community. Fondato nel sud Italia 14 anni fa, SuccoAcido vive in Europa e nel bacino del Mediterraneo, ma strizza l'occhio ad altri continenti, perché l'obiettivo è di pubblicare in tutte le lingue del mondo entro i prossimi 10 anni. SuccoAcido rappresenta un modello di giornalismo indipendente e raccoglie articoli e interviste, ma anche notizie dal mondo dell'arte, del cinema, del comics, della musica e della scrittura, pubblicate ogni giorno in tutte le lingue. La nostra ragion d'essere è far sì che le persone possano incontrarsi, incrociando virtualmente lingue e circuiti culturali del maggior numero di paesi possibile.

Le nostre risorse basate sulla pubblicità tabellare o sugli abbonamenti di chi vuole distribuire una rivista gratuita che sono la garanzia della nostra indipendenza e la nostra neutralità editoriale.Ovunque nel mondo, infatti, la cultura dovrebbe essere al primo posto negli investimenti pubblici e privati, per il bene comune, ma purtroppo non è così. Da quando abbiamo cominciato questo progetto, noi abbiamo investito di anno in anno più del doppio della cifra che oggi chiediamo e siamo convinti che non ci fosse modo migliore per spendere il nostro denaro. Tutto il nostro guadagno è stato infatti sempre reinvestito nel giornale. Abbiamo fatto del nostro meglio e con ottimi risultati, ma non possiamo continuare più a sostenere da soli un progetto culturale così complesso. Se credete che SuccoAcido sia una risorsa importante, adesso è il momento di aiutarci a proseguire in questa direzione. Supportateci in ogni modo possibile, fino al termine della campagna...



Con questa campagna noi intendiamo lanciare un progetto culturale che si fonda su una proposta articolata: 
1. da un lato vogliamo continuare a fare ricerca, presentare il punto di vista degli artisti, attraverso interviste e articoli su carta e on line, proseguendo e incrementando l'edizione cartacea del giornale e l'attività del portale web. L'edizione on line del giornale potrà ancora essere aggiornata quotidianamente e quella cartacea potrà avere una cadenza di 3 o quattro mesi.


2. D'altra parte desideriamo anche estendere il nostro archivio e l'aggiornamento quotidiano delle news dal mondo della cultura internazionale sviluppando una app che tutti i nostri lettori, da qualsiasi parte del mondo potranno seguire scaricandola sui propri mobiles, smartphone e tablet.


3. Inoltre vogliamo estendere la distribuzione a nuovi Paesi incrementando la lista dei nostri distributori e partners!!!! Pubblicato in tante lingue SuccoAcido è un raro esempio di incrocio di culture in un modo semplice, ma innovativo. Credete come noi che SuccoAcido aiuti a riflettere sulle differenze tra le culture, ponendo ciascuno  di fronte ai propri limiti? Vi suona come un piccolo manifesto della complessità culturale da esportare in altre galassie e mondi? Noi speriamo di sì...  Ricordate: sostenere SuccoAcido significa sostenere anche tutti quei circuiti culturali che la rivista sostiene da anni.




In particolare i soldi che raccoglieremo dalla campagna di crowdfunding saranno utilizzati: 
Per STAMPARE e DISTRIBUIRE le uscite cartacee di SuccoAcido nel 2015
Per SVILUPPARE e MANTENERE il sito SuccoAcido e la community  
Per SVILUPPARE un app di SuccoAcido per iPhone, iPad e Android 
Per ALLARGARE il nostro team per articoli e traduzioni 
Per REALIZZARE le borse, le tazze e le magliette di SuccoAcido e altri cd per voi
Per LEGGERE E FILMARE insieme le SuccoAcido Collective Readings... 
Il 23/12/2014, alla fine di questa campagna di crowd funding, se non avremo raggiunto il nostro obiettivo riformuleremo il progetto dell'edizione cartacea con tirature e periodicità minime e nei primi mesi del 2015, lanceremo altre campagne di crowdfunding per sviluppare una più diffusa distribuzione della rivista in altri stati e continenti. Se invece raggiungeremo il nostro obiettivo potremo impiegare i nostri collaboratori, è il più grande sogno di sempre.

SuccoAcido Collective Readings Spring 2015 Tour & Film (date disponibili)
Un ""SuccoAcido Collective Reading"" è un gioco sui media. Uno spettacolo dedicato a diverse scene culturali, un momento di confronto sulle tematiche politiche inerenti alla situazione dell'informazione e dell'editoria oggi. Lo spettacolo è incentrato sulla performance e sulla condivisione di pensiero, musica, parole. L'accordatura della carta e la lettura comune delle copie di SuccoAcido distribuite al pubblico sono l'avvio di un'esperienza corale e sempre diversa. In ogni città saranno invitati artisti diversi a intervenire sul palco. Il tour sarà filmato per realizzare il secondo road movie di Marc De Dieux (Pulp Critic). Puoi ricevere a casa 10 copie arretrate di SuccoAcido per filmare 1 minuto della tua SuccoAcido Collective Reading con gli amici, poi inviaci il tuo video per far parte del film. Scriveteci prima di prenotare questo premio per controllare la disponibilità delle date. L'indirizzo è  sacr[at]succoacido[dot]net

<h3>¿Qué?</h3>
<p><strong>Sangre de cristal</strong> narra las aventuras de Danae a su llegada a una prestigiosa universidad nórdica; con elementos de fantasía en un alarde de genialidad creativa.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Agua. Aire. Fuego. Tierra.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">El sueño de Danae Winters es obtener una plaza en Somnus, una facultad al norte de Europa donde se reúnen los mayores talentos del continente. Estrellas del deporte, artistas, genios… El futuro del mundo concentrado en un único espacio.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Pero cuando le confirman su admisión, Danae descubre que la universidad esconde un antiguo secreto, un misterio ancestral que mantiene el mundo a salvo desde hace milenios. No podrá escapar del destino que le ha sido reservado: convertirse en una Elemental y luchar contra los djinns, sus némesis, unas criaturas malévolas que encarnan el desequilibrio del universo.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Entre luchas, amistades y traiciones, la joven y sus amigos necesitarán de la ayuda de los cuatro elementos para enfrentarse a la misión de sus vidas.</p>
<h3>¿Quiénes?</h3>
<p><strong>Tandaia</strong> es una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.</p>
<p>De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.</p>
<p>Hoy te presentamos a <strong>L.P. Larraya</strong>.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">La vida de esta autora de Pamplona ha estado marcada desde siempre por lo académico. De padre abogado y madre profesora, ellos le enseñaron el placer de la lectura, convirtiéndose este en pasión a lo largo de los años. Tras completar sus estudios en la Universidad de Navarra y la UPNA, ejerce como maestra en un colegio de Primaria. Reparte el tiempo libre entre su familia, sus amigos y las historias que integran su vida.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">L.P. Larraya debutó en 2012 con <i>Las correas de Julia</i>, una historia de suspense a la que siguió en 2014 la novela negra <i>Cuando los ángeles caen</i>. Ahora su estilo da un giro de 180º al publicar <i>Sangre de cristal</i>, la primera parte de la trilogía fantástica de <i>La Hija del Viento</i>.</p>
<h3>¿Por qué?</h3>
<p>Y por aquí, una muestra de lo que encontrarás en sus páginas:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">«―Mi nombre es Andrew Halloway y, aunque durante vuestras primeras horas en Somnus me presenté como el director de la Oficina de Nuevos Estudiantes, os mentí. Todos os mentimos aquel día.<br/>     Danae se acordaba de sus caras: el rector, la señorita Bessoin, Halloway. ¿Qué quería decir con que les habían mentido?<br/>     ―En realidad, Somnus es una mentira ―tras oír un par de gritos ahogados, Halloway se corrigió a sí mismo―. O, más bien, una tapadera. Esta universidad se fundó con la única intención de congregar y proteger a personas como vosotros. Como nosotros, a decir verdad.<br/>     ¿El resto se sentirían como ella? ¿Serían conscientes de que les estaba llamando raros? El truco de incluirse en la manada para que confiaran en él como uno más no daría resultado con Danae. Al menos, su monólogo había servido para que incluso Cecily enmudeciera.<br/>     ―Quiero que entendáis una premisa fundamental: sois especiales. El mundo os ha bombardeado durante años con la idea de lo genial que es ser normal y pertenecer a la media. Es decir, con la idea de ser mediocres.

</div></div>","¿Qué?
Sangre de cristal narra las aventuras de Danae a su llegada a una prestigiosa universidad nórdica; con elementos de fantasía en un alarde de genialidad creativa.
Agua. Aire. Fuego. Tierra.
El sueño de Danae Winters es obtener una plaza en Somnus, una facultad al norte de Europa donde se reúnen los mayores talentos del continente. Estrellas del deporte, artistas, genios… El futuro del mundo concentrado en un único espacio.
Pero cuando le confirman su admisión, Danae descubre que la universidad esconde un antiguo secreto, un misterio ancestral que mantiene el mundo a salvo desde hace milenios. No podrá escapar del destino que le ha sido reservado: convertirse en una Elemental y luchar contra los djinns, sus némesis, unas criaturas malévolas que encarnan el desequilibrio del universo.
Entre luchas, amistades y traiciones, la joven y sus amigos necesitarán de la ayuda de los cuatro elementos para enfrentarse a la misión de sus vidas.
¿Quiénes?
Tandaia es una joven editorial con voluntad de cambio, de dar la alternativa a autores que no la encuentran en otro lugar, con nuevas y refrescantes ideas como es el emplear una campaña preventa para valorar la aceptación y viabilidad de cada título.
De este modo eres tú, ahora que te estás planteando cómo colaborar, el que decide si la obra que te presentamos verá la luz pasando a formar parte de nuestro catálogo... porque consideramos al lector parte fundamental del proceso.
Hoy te presentamos a L.P. Larraya.
La vida de esta autora de Pamplona ha estado marcada desde siempre por lo académico. De padre abogado y madre profesora, ellos le enseñaron el placer de la lectura, convirtiéndose este en pasión a lo largo de los años. Tras completar sus estudios en la Universidad de Navarra y la UPNA, ejerce como maestra en un colegio de Primaria. Reparte el tiempo libre entre su familia, sus amigos y las historias que integran su vida.
L.P. Larraya debutó en 2012 con Las correas de Julia, una historia de suspense a la que siguió en 2014 la novela negra Cuando los ángeles caen. Ahora su estilo da un giro de 180º al publicar Sangre de cristal, la primera parte de la trilogía fantástica de La Hija del Viento.
¿Por qué?
Y por aquí, una muestra de lo que encontrarás en sus páginas:
«―Mi nombre es Andrew Halloway y, aunque durante vuestras primeras horas en Somnus me presenté como el director de la Oficina de Nuevos Estudiantes, os mentí. Todos os mentimos aquel día.     Danae se acordaba de sus caras: el rector, la señorita Bessoin, Halloway. ¿Qué quería decir con que les habían mentido?     ―En realidad, Somnus es una mentira ―tras oír un par de gritos ahogados, Halloway se corrigió a sí mismo―. O, más bien, una tapadera. Esta universidad se fundó con la única intención de congregar y proteger a personas como vosotros. Como nosotros, a decir verdad.     ¿El resto se sentirían como ella? ¿Serían conscientes de que les estaba llamando raros? El truco de incluirse en la manada para que confiaran en él como uno más no daría resultado con Danae. Al menos, su monólogo había servido para que incluso Cecily enmudeciera.     ―Quiero que entendáis una premisa fundamental: sois especiales. El mundo os ha bombardeado durante años con la idea de lo genial que es ser normal y pertenecer a la media. Es decir, con la idea de ser mediocres. En la sociedad, el clavo que sobresale es el que recibe el martillazo. Y vosotros, amigos míos, vosotros brilláis desde que nacisteis.     Incluso el ruido de su corazón, que latía con inusitada fuerza, le parecía a Danae escandaloso en medio del silencio que abnegaba sus oídos.     ―En la antigüedad, cuando éramos más numerosos, recorríamos los pueblos y ciudades buscando a los nuestros. Les explicaban quiénes eran en realidad y los entrenaban para su misión, que también es la vuestra. Pero las cosas fueron cambiando: la imprenta, los periódicos, el motor a vapor… Los nuevos avances facilitaron el acceso a la información y nos impidió movernos con tanta libertad ―Halloway bajó el tono―. Tuvimos que escondernos mejor.     ―Esto es lo que puedo contaros por el momento, y creedme, es suficiente ―hubo murmullos de descontento que acalló con un gesto―. Es vuestro momento de decidir. Podéis salir de aquí y convenceros de que ha sido una broma. Pero también podéis aceptar vuestro destino: no será fácil; la preparación será dura, física y moralmente; tendréis que dejar las clases y cualquier anhelo de vida común que pudierais desear.

<h3>Maim Your Characters</h3>
<p><i>How Injuries Work in Fiction </i></p>
<p><strong>Coming September 4th, 2017</strong>, from Even Keel Press</p>
<h3><a href=""http://bookhip.com/VQWDPT"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here to download a 100+ page sample! </a></h3>
<p><i>Maim Your Characters</i> is the definitive guide to using wounds and injuries to their greatest effect in your story. Learn not only the six critical parts of an injury plot, but more importantly, how to make sure that the injury you’re inflicting <i>matters</i>.</p>
<p>With in-depth analysis of nine different injury plots in popular fiction and a walkthrough of how to build your own, this book is the guide to using injuries in your story. Written by a paramedic with a decade of experience, <i>Maim Your Characters </i>will teach you what to do — and what not to.</p>
<p>This book also includes a sneak preview of the upcoming <i>Blood on the Page</i>, a book of injuries to incorporate into your tales. If <i>Maim Your Characters </i>is the <i>how </i>and <i>why </i>of injuring characters, then <i>Blood on the Page </i>is the <i>what</i>. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p><i>Maim Your Characters </i>is a 400-page book that talks not only about existing injury plots, but walks you through plot creation step-by-step. In addition, two original injury plots were written for the book as part of demonstration and walk-through of plot creation. </p>
<p>There are several versions available for readers: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Signed Print Copies</strong>.<br/>Inscriptions are available, and I'm more than happy to sign a copy just for you! I'll reach out with an email asking how you'd like the book to be inscribed, and who to make it out to. See below for shipping information. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Signed Digital Copies. </strong><br/>Digital copies of <i>Maim Your Characters </i>will be custom-generated, including a special signed page at the front of the book. The process takes effort, since each copy has to be re-exported by hand after the image is included, but it's worth it to make you happy. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Executive Producer Status for the upcoming <i>Blood on the Page</i>. </strong><br/>Executive Producers are those who've chosen to contribute $100 or more to the campaign. <i>Blood on the Page </i>requires not just a copyeditor and proofreader, but a medical editor for checking the facts presented in the book; because it contains over 40 injuries and pieces of general information, having another set of eyes on the medicine is necessary -- and expensive. </li>
</ul>
<h3>A Word on Shipping </h3>
<p>First, while I aim to get all orders out the door on or before launch date, that will depend on matters not entirely within my control; Amazon must first ship me the books, I need to sign them, get envelopes, pay postage, and ship them out. This is part of the reason each print copy will include a bonus digital copy for free, which will be released on launch day. That way you don't miss out on the book!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Standard Shipping:</strong> In the US, this will be via Media Mail, to save expense for all of us. </li>
<li>
<strong>Express Shipping: </strong>In the US, this will be via USPS Priority Mail 3-Day service in a flat-rate box or envelope. </li>
<li>
<strong>International Shipping: </strong>All international orders will ship via USPS First Class International mail; delivery time will vary based on travel time, customs, etc. I claim no responsibility for your book getting held up in customs. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> The way IndieGoGo sets this up, the express tiers have to be different perks, not an option within each perk. Thus the different perks with the same pricing. The pricing difference is in the shipping, which will be revealed when you click Get This Perk.  In the US, standard shipping is $5; Express shipping is $8. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The ScriptMedic Mission </h3>
<p>On the surface, it may seem that the ScriptMedic ethos is simply a dedication to accuracy. But when it comes to medicine, popular misconceptions can be lethal. </p>
<p>The blog started as a way to get more accurate information into the world about how injuries and illnesses and medicine works, but it's snowballed into so much more. An entire family of content experts have sprung up to help writers with topics from psychology to firefighting and from autism to the everyday lives of German people. </p>
<p>The goal is to help writers write more accurate stories, ones that their audiences can believe. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>A few months ago, I made a terrifying leap. </p>
<p>My personal income was predicated on having  two day jobs: full-time and per-diem. However, I moved to the per-diem job full-time, which has left me with a significant income gap. Part of that has been filled by regular support on Patreon, but sales of this book and the upcoming <i>Blood on the Page</i> will hopefully replace that lost income, or more. These books will form the basis of a writing career, or be the reason I go back to having two day jobs. </p>
<p>A lot more is riding on this in terms of my personal future than meets the eye. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't contribute? That's okay! There are lots of other ways to help: </p>
<ul>
<li>Share the campaign on Twitter, Facebook, and other places. </li>
<li>Tell your writer friends and critique groups about the book. </li>
<li>Let authors you love know about the book! </li>
<li>Take a selfie with your copy (when it comes in) and share it on your social media.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's all there is to it! </p>

How Injuries Work in Fiction 
Coming September 4th, 2017, from Even Keel Press
Click here to download a 100+ page sample! 
Maim Your Characters is the definitive guide to using wounds and injuries to their greatest effect in your story. Learn not only the six critical parts of an injury plot, but more importantly, how to make sure that the injury you’re inflicting matters.
With in-depth analysis of nine different injury plots in popular fiction and a walkthrough of how to build your own, this book is the guide to using injuries in your story. Written by a paramedic with a decade of experience, Maim Your Characters will teach you what to do — and what not to.
This book also includes a sneak preview of the upcoming Blood on the Page, a book of injuries to incorporate into your tales. If Maim Your Characters is the how and why of injuring characters, then Blood on the Page is the what. 
 

What You Get
Maim Your Characters is a 400-page book that talks not only about existing injury plots, but walks you through plot creation step-by-step. In addition, two original injury plots were written for the book as part of demonstration and walk-through of plot creation. 
There are several versions available for readers: 


Signed Print Copies.Inscriptions are available, and I'm more than happy to sign a copy just for you! I'll reach out with an email asking how you'd like the book to be inscribed, and who to make it out to. See below for shipping information.  

Signed Digital Copies. Digital copies of Maim Your Characters will be custom-generated, including a special signed page at the front of the book. The process takes effort, since each copy has to be re-exported by hand after the image is included, but it's worth it to make you happy.  

Executive Producer Status for the upcoming Blood on the Page. Executive Producers are those who've chosen to contribute $100 or more to the campaign. Blood on the Page requires not just a copyeditor and proofreader, but a medical editor for checking the facts presented in the book; because it contains over 40 injuries and pieces of general information, having another set of eyes on the medicine is necessary -- and expensive. 

A Word on Shipping 
First, while I aim to get all orders out the door on or before launch date, that will depend on matters not entirely within my control; Amazon must first ship me the books, I need to sign them, get envelopes, pay postage, and ship them out. This is part of the reason each print copy will include a bonus digital copy for free, which will be released on launch day. That way you don't miss out on the book!


Standard Shipping: In the US, this will be via Media Mail, to save expense for all of us. 

Express Shipping: In the US, this will be via USPS Priority Mail 3-Day service in a flat-rate box or envelope. 

International Shipping: All international orders will ship via USPS First Class International mail; delivery time will vary based on travel time, customs, etc. I claim no responsibility for your book getting held up in customs. 

Pricing: The way IndieGoGo sets this up, the express tiers have to be different perks, not an option within each perk. Thus the different perks with the same pricing. The pricing difference is in the shipping, which will be revealed when you click Get This Perk.  In the US, standard shipping is $5; Express shipping is $8. 

The ScriptMedic Mission 
On the surface, it may seem that the ScriptMedic ethos is simply a dedication to accuracy. But when it comes to medicine, popular misconceptions can be lethal. 
The blog started as a way to get more accurate information into the world about how injuries and illnesses and medicine works, but it's snowballed into so much more. An entire family of content experts have sprung up to help writers with topics from psychology to firefighting and from autism to the everyday lives of German people. 
The goal is to help writers write more accurate stories, ones that their audiences can believe. 
 

Risks & Challenges
A few months ago, I made a terrifying leap. 
My personal income was predicated on having  two day jobs: full-time and per-diem. However, I moved to the per-diem job full-time, which has left me with a significant income gap. Part of that has been filled by regular support on Patreon, but sales of this book and the upcoming Blood on the Page will hopefully replace that lost income, or more. These books will form the basis of a writing career, or be the reason I go back to having two day jobs. 
A lot more is riding on this in terms of my personal future than meets the eye. 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Can't contribute? That's okay! There are lots of other ways to help: 

Share the campaign on Twitter, Facebook, and other places. 
Tell your writer friends and critique groups about the book. 
Let authors you love know about the book! 
Take a selfie with your copy (when it comes in) and share it on your social media.

And that's all there is to it! 
Thanks so much for your gracious preorders and I hope together we can make this book a success!

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>My Heart of Rice</i> explores how food, family, and love has shaped and motivated my sense of culture, identity, and self-discovery.<br/><br/>My name is Ashley Lanuza and I am the author of <i>My Heart of Rice</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to share my experiences as a Filipino-American and the narratives I have read and heard about from my peers and university research. Concepts that occur in the community, such as community conditions and histories, were not available to me until I attended UCLA- and if it was hidden from me at a young age, it is probably hidden from today's youth, as well. I want to retell these narratives to emphasize unity in our shared experiences and accept the differences in our unique details; moreover, to remind every reader of how familial love has shaped our love for ourselves.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how your personal life and memories intersect with the bigger picture found in history and society. I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for family, culture, and self-discovery in you. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to guide you in your search for your roots and sociocultural identity.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the love of family and redefining the words “Filipino-American”:</p>
<ul>
<li>The relationship between my grandfather and I, emphasized by the Filipino food he cooked, and how that shaped how I saw myself in society</li>
<li>The realization that not all Filipinos/Filipino-Americans share the same experiences- just similar ones, and that the unique details don't invalidate your own narrative</li>
<li>The research on Filipino-American history and the community conditions we tend to face as a result of our cultural values and identity</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you love poetry, interested in the Filipino-American experience, or love relatable literature that describes the influences of family and society on an individual.<br/><br/><i>My Heart of Rice</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to Filipino Americans and non Filipino-Americans who are looking at unique narratives, erased histories, and unspoken community patterns.</p>
<h2>The Book - My Heart of Rice</h2>
<p>The book is written in 5 Parts....so far....<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> discusses childhood- the developing relationship I have with traditional Filipino food through dinners and grocery store visits. It also explores micro-aggressions I experienced in elementary school, along with introducing a character who started to influence my identity with their own Hispanic culture.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> looks at high school, where I was mostly the “Filipino Club” on campus. It explores my relationship with Hispanic peers and an attempt to assimilate with a culture similar- yet still different- than my own.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> explores the cultural division I felt in submersing myself with Filipino/Filipino American peers, communities that I was not accustomed to and where I sometimes felt “not Filipino enough.”<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> discusses my discovery about histories and community conditions I was oblivious to prior to college. Through a fictional first-person perspective, I take on key Filipino characters in history- such as the first Filipino settlers in 1700s Louisiana, Filipino immigrants in Stockton, California, the unionizing Filipino farmworkers in Delano, and the concept of the Balikbayan boxes and Overseas Filipino Workers. I also discuss community conditions, such as Filipinos-Americans’ pressure into entering the STEM field, the immigrant experience, and defining what it means to be a community activist. This section is heavy with research, rhetorical questions, and discovery. Its the part that pushed me to make this book in the first place.<br/><br/><strong>Part 5</strong> deals with the aftermath of what I've learned. At this point, I've accepted my differences from my peers, and find similarities that don't always have to pinpoint back to being Filipino. From here, I discuss ""What now?"" in a sort of meta, fourth wall way, you can say that publishing this book is the answer to my dilemma. Or maybe, there's more to it. However, it all goes back to the food, the love, and the family I have, and how much that has influenced who I am, and who I want to be, today.</p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>

<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this upcoming winter.</li>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p><strong>Ashley Lanuza</strong> is a senior at UCLA studying Psychology, Film, and Asian American studies. This LA native has published articles with the Mid-Valley News, the Daily Bruin, and Odyssey. Her career focus, however, is in script development, and she hopes to develop and produce film and television that pushes for diverse storytelling and representation.<br/><br/>Ashley wrote this book to share her story and the narratives she's heard from her peers and read about during her UCLA studies. Her passion for telling untold stories started at a young age, and has prompted her dream of becoming a published author. Who knew that dreams can become a reality, too?<br/><br/>Although voted “Samabaddie” by her UCLA peers in 2016, Ashley is anything but “bad” (what does that mean, anyway?!). She can go on an hour-long analytical discussion (see <i>rant</i>) about music, literature, and movies (especially movies), bore you to death about it, and then suggest to get ice cream afterwards. You'll also probably be walking the entire time with her because she's happiest when “exploring” (see <i>wasting time aimlessly walking around small towns and big cities</i>).<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Ashley at <u>ashley.lanuza@gmail.com</u> and Ashley Nicole on Facebook and @ashlanuza_ on Instagram.</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by <strong>building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs </strong>of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>

Platforms such as Palestine Deep Dive seek to address this and undertake valuable work in providing a platform where these voices can be amplified and the facts of the ongoing oppression of the Palestinian people be brought into the public domain.”</p><p>~ <strong>Ben Jamal </strong>(Director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign)</p><p>“Although new on the scene, Palestine Deep Dive already fills a gap in crucial information about Palestine, creatively curating the politics of the day as well as cultural events to ensure that the cause of freedom is firmly front and center in world affairs”</p><p>~ <strong>Nadia Hijab</strong> (co-founder of Al-Shabaka: The Palestinian Policy network; co-founder of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights)</p><p>“News is what someone somewhere wants to suppress, however, Palestine DeepDive relentless goes for the truth... and that is the greatest news.”</p><p>~ <strong>Najwa Najjar</strong> (Award winning Palestinian writer and film director)</p><p>Palestine Deep Dive is a unique platform dedicated to amplifying the Palestinian voice and to creating an alternative, more equitable media channel on Palestine and Israel. PDDʼs uniqueness stems largely from the diversity of its approach, while maintaining the integrity of its message. While many other platforms claim to serve the same purpose, PDD is truly independent and is entirely motivated by its foundersʼ belief in offering a safe environment for essential voices on Palestine, while fully adhering to the principles of free speech, a lacking quality in mainstream media coverage of the subject.

A shift driven by decades of tireless grassroots advocacy, brave frontline reporting, network building and campaigning to bring us to this pivotal moment. In a matter of weeks the struggle for Palestinian rights and justice broke through into mainstream public awareness, albeit under dire circumstances, with Palestinian voices finally starting to be given some space to present their realities to the world across various media.  But while Palestinians might well have been given more space on the airwaves in recent weeks compared to previously, we know this may well be another rapidly closing window only open during Israel’s latest assaults on Gaza. And unsurprisingly we’ve already seen attempts to firmly close the lid on news from Palestine reaching the wider world across the media landscape since May. Journalism Under AttackIn many places around the world today journalists are increasingly under attack but this is especially so in Israel/Palestine. The International Federation of Journalists report that at least 46 Palestinian journalists have been killed by Israel since 2000.And in the last couple of months alone, at least two Palestinian journalists have been killed and more than one hundred injured. We’ve witnessed footage of Al Jazeera’s Givara Budeiri being assaulted and arrested by Israeli soldiers, among others, while attempting to report on events in East Jerusalem and we’ve seen the bombardment and destruction of whole media offices belonging to the Associated Press, Al Jazeera and others in Gaza by Israeli warplanes. And it is not just professional journalists who are under attack. With the nature of journalism changing before our eyes with technology, young people especially are able to share stories widely before official outlets get hold of them. In Gaza “everyone now is learning to be a journalist” Raed Shakshak, Outreach Coordinator for We Are Not Numbers, told us on our live show whilst under bombardment in May. With the popularity of smartphones and their ability to instantly share footage and ‘go live’ on social media platforms, this has had a dramatic impact on awakening the world to Palestinian realities. But as Mona Shtaya and Mariam Barghouti exposed in our live show “Israel’s War on Media”, attempts to stymy the flow of news from Palestine through a ‘blackout’ extend into the sphere of social media too. In addition to online censorship, young people with large social media platforms also face intimidation, violence and arrest, as seen with the recent arrest of our live show guest Mohammed El-Kurd.In the face of attempted media blackouts, now is a vital time to shine the light on Israel/Palestine brighter than ever before. By amplifying the work of fearless journalists and a new generation of brave Palestinian voices we help to strengthen the flow of news from Palestine reaching the West.We are Asking for your Support Palestine Deep Dive is a bold new media alternative shining a fresh spotlight on journalism surrounding Israel/Palestine, connecting Palestinian realities with Western audiences. We seek to educate and empower a growing audience concerned with human rights, democracy, freedom of speech, justice and equality, which must be heard now more than ever.We host world-leading experts and voices from the ground alike in regular live shows presenting the latest news from Palestine coupled with in-depth analysis. Since April 2020 we have produced 35 live shows, with over 60% of our guests being Palestinian. Our recent shows have included DeepDives into the global arms trade with Israel and “Israel’s War on the Media” as well as hearing live from young Palestinians whilst enduring bombardment in Gaza and undergoing forced eviction in East Jerusalem. We also produced the first English-language video interview with Loay Elbasyouni, the Palestinian lead electrical engineer on NASA’s Mars Ingenuity Helicopter, and utilised our international media network to further amplify his voice around the world.  And we deliver news daily straight to your inbox through our newsletter, Deep Dive Daily. Our experienced editors curate vital stories, quality journalism and ‘Going Viral’ clips before they hit the headlines each day. We have curated over 500 newsletters since January 2021 and with thousands of subscribers, our rapidly growing audience consists of policy makers, journalists, campaigners and individuals around the world. Finally, producing meaningful journalism today also means strengthening the voices of tomorrow. Palestine Deep Dive will do this in the short term by producing a range of online journalism training workshops for young Palestinians in Gaza this month. Our ultimate goal, with your support, is to establish a scholarship programme for young Palestinian journalists to study in the UK or USA. By starting a fundraising campaign now we believe our first participants can attend a university course in 2022.  Thank you for continuing to recognise the work we are doing - we are extremely grateful to all our show participants and here are some of their recent comments on the importance of our work:  “Palestinian voices and the voices of those advocating for Palestine all too often excluded from the mainstream media . Platforms such as Palestine Deep Dive seek to address this and undertake valuable work in providing a platform where these voices can be amplified and the facts of the ongoing oppression of the Palestinian people be brought into the public domain.”~ Ben Jamal (Director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign)“Although new on the scene, Palestine Deep Dive already fills a gap in crucial information about Palestine, creatively curating the politics of the day as well as cultural events to ensure that the cause of freedom is firmly front and center in world affairs”~ Nadia Hijab (co-founder of Al-Shabaka: The Palestinian Policy network; co-founder of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights)“News is what someone somewhere wants to suppress, however, Palestine DeepDive relentless goes for the truth... and that is the greatest news.”~ Najwa Najjar (Award winning Palestinian writer and film director)Palestine Deep Dive is a unique platform dedicated to amplifying the Palestinian voice and to creating an alternative, more equitable media channel on Palestine and Israel. PDDʼs uniqueness stems largely from the diversity of its approach, while maintaining the integrity of its message. While many other platforms claim to serve the same purpose, PDD is truly independent and is entirely motivated by its foundersʼ belief in offering a safe environment for essential voices on Palestine, while fully adhering to the principles of free speech, a lacking quality in mainstream media coverage of the subject. PDD deserves our encouragement and full support.~ Dr. Ramzy Baroud (Journalist, author, editor and founder of the Palestine Chronicle)“PDD fills a void in global media, centering the voices of scholars, activists, and policymakers who offer a nuanced and measured take on the news of the moment.
