<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This February, I will be traveling with a team of eleven Orthotics and Prosthetics Graduate students from Northwestern University to Guatemala for a week long volunteer effort with the community of Zacapa, Guatemala. We will be working with The Range of Motion Project (ROMP) who has fully staffed clinical sites in Guatemala and Ecuador. Our days will consist of clinical evaluations of patients, fabricating prostheses (artificial limbs) and orthoses (walking braces), educating patients on proper wear and care of their prosthetic and orthotic devices and most importantly giving the individuals in this community the opportunity to walk once again and improve their daily lives. The video above highlights a trip from a previous group of volunteers. This is the same clinic I will be working at with the same population. Without the help of volunteer teams like ourselves working with the ROMP team, these patients in need would not be able to receive the specialized care they require to return to fully functioning status in their communities.</p>

<p>What
would you do if your long awaited vacation became the health and financial
nightmare? That's what happened to my friend Marissa Gomez when she left
Trinidad to visit her sister who she had not seen for several years.</p>
<p>Marissa
had been experiencing severe stomach pains about a month before she left
Trinidad, but the local hospital did not see any major problems when they ran
tests, so she left on her trip feeling better and eager to relax. Two days
after her arrival her intense abdominal pain returned. She tried treating it
with ibuprofen however her pain got worse over the next few days, and it became
so bad, that she was rushed to the nearby Emergency Department of Cleveland
Clinic after suffering a week of terrible pain. There after numerous tests,
doctors diagnosed that she had an abscess, and recommended a one hour
procedure. When they actually started to operate, they in fact discovered that
the situation was much worse. She had a perforated appendix, which led to the
abscess and which had also caused a hole to form in her intestines and the one
hour procedure became a five hour one to save her life.</p>
<p>The
entire procedure and her recovery cost $45,000USD which must be paid within
thirty days as this is a special “Discounted rate for non-nationals” or the
cost will be raised to the full amount – over $90,000USD. Since she was
discharged on 6<sup>th</sup> November, unfortunately complications have
developed and they have discovered that she has excess fluid in her abdomen
which is still causing her severe pain and fevers and is a source of infection
and she now has to do another procedure costing $10,993.00USD. This cost they
expect her to pay upfront before the surgery can take place. </p>
<p>As a
dedicated government employee of 13 years, Marissa has always had a passion to
help others. She works as a lawyer for her country. As someone who suffers from
Lupus, she supports awareness campaigns and ran to raise awareness in a local
half marathon though her joints were racked with pain as she ran. She gives
constant care, support and financial assistance to her father, a three time
cancer survivor, and her mother who recently did a knee operation and is
currently going through therapeutic care. As a member of the cross fit
community, Marissa regularly encourages and supports her fellow cross fitters
in striving to achieve their goals and her own dedication to the support has
proved to be an inspiration to many. </p>
<p>Marissa
understandably does not have a lot of spare funds, as her trip was to be a short
and pleasant stay to enjoy the company of her family. Medical insurance is very
limited and is not assisting her abroad. It is therefore devastating for her to
have to pay these bills when the local exchange rate is nearly $1 USD to $7 TT.
She needs help, so I hope her friends, family and people out in the world who
care will offer some assistance. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li>Every penny we raise will go toward settling Marissa's medical bills. All contributions will be used as even a little might help ease this enormous financial burden.</li>

cost will be raised to the full amount – over $90,000USD. Since she was
discharged on 6th November, unfortunately complications have
developed and they have discovered that she has excess fluid in her abdomen
which is still causing her severe pain and fevers and is a source of infection
and she now has to do another procedure costing $10,993.00USD. This cost they
expect her to pay upfront before the surgery can take place. 
As a
dedicated government employee of 13 years, Marissa has always had a passion to
help others. She works as a lawyer for her country. As someone who suffers from
Lupus, she supports awareness campaigns and ran to raise awareness in a local
half marathon though her joints were racked with pain as she ran. She gives
constant care, support and financial assistance to her father, a three time
cancer survivor, and her mother who recently did a knee operation and is
currently going through therapeutic care. As a member of the cross fit
community, Marissa regularly encourages and supports her fellow cross fitters
in striving to achieve their goals and her own dedication to the support has
proved to be an inspiration to many. 
Marissa
understandably does not have a lot of spare funds, as her trip was to be a short
and pleasant stay to enjoy the company of her family. Medical insurance is very
limited and is not assisting her abroad. It is therefore devastating for her to
have to pay these bills when the local exchange rate is nearly $1 USD to $7 TT.
She needs help, so I hope her friends, family and people out in the world who
care will offer some assistance. 
   What We Need & What You Get 
Every penny we raise will go toward settling Marissa's medical bills. All contributions will be used as even a little might help ease this enormous financial burden.

<h3>My son's story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Chandler has had a rough road in life, but so many have. He lost his twin before birth, he was legally blind in one eye, and a learning disability. But, Chandler is the sweetest child. He would give anyone the shirt off of his back.</p>
<p>October 2011, he was assaulted by a former friend. At our local mall, the teen choked my son until he passed out, then threw him on the conrete floor. Chandlers chin  hit the floor first, splitting 9 teeth.</p>
<p>No one came to his aid.</p>
<p>Finally, a couple of friends (?) who watched the ordeal drug him into the bathroom, unconsious. They made up a story and called me to tell me he had fallen down the stairs and was hurt. I knew of only a stairway of about 3 stairs so I wasn't too concerned at first.</p>
<p>When I got there, I knew it was bad. He was covered in blood. He was in and out of consciousness, spitting up blood. I got him to a local hospital.</p>
<p>But, instead of being taken care of , Chandler was further bullied at our local hopsital. Chandler has pink hair, or he had it at the time. He dyed it pink to support Breast Cancer Awareness. Again though, it was assumed it was just because he was gay.</p>
<p>When the nurse saw Chandler, he immediately asked me what drugs he was on. I was floored. I asked him why did he think that. He snickered and said ""well, look at his hair and he is black"". Due to his instant judgement, Chandler's treatment that night was abysmal. Chandler never received anything for his pain. I begged them to do a drug test so they could see that he was not on anything.</p>
<p>Finally, after receiving the diagnosis, I went to the restroom. I came back, he had been released to the care of his 14 year old girlfriend, who signed the release. I asked the nurse why she did that and she said becasue she didn't think he had a mother.</p>
<p>So, being bi-racial and having pink hair obviously makes what happened to him okay in the staff that night. I still to this day can't believe it.</p>
<p>But, Chandler needs dental implants that cost about 3500 each. He needs 9 of them. The spacers he needs are 2k each. My insurance covers 1500 a year.</p>
<p>My son is now homeschooled. He had been bullied for years but had stuck it out. But this situation did something to him.</p>
<p>He is angry and sad. There has been no justice for him. He has lost weight because he can't eat the way he used to. He looks different in the face. I just want him to have a chance at being a normal teen. Something taken away from him by a kid. Why did this kid do this? He asked Chandler if his girlfriend was cheating on him and Chandler told him yes. So, he took it out on Chandler.</p>
<p>Please, if anyone can help, we would appreciate it. Our dentist in Springfield, Mo is Dr George Arquitt if anyone needs to verify. The office phone number is <br/>417-887-8800.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Jacob Myers is an average twelve year old.  He plays video games, likes building legos, and going camping with his family.  He does not let the fact that he was diagnosed with Duchenne’s Muscular Dystrophy stop him from doing the things he loves and also helping others.  For the past several years, Jake has taken part in an annual MDA ""Muscle Walk"" and this year he raised the most money in his event!</p>
<p>But now it’s time for us to do something for Jake.  Unfortunately, he lost his ability to walk this past November.  To help Jake continue with his active life, his family needs to purchase a van and have it converted to be able to carry and transport Jake and his powerchair.</p>
<p>Jake comes from a family that have dedicated their lives to helping people.  His mother is a nurse and his father has been a police officer for 24 years. They are not the type to ask for help, so his father's co-workers are asking for them.</p>
<p>The cost of a van, with the expense of converting it to handicap-accessible - is approximately $60,000.  We are holding raffles and other events to raise money, but we know how generous the ""internet world"" can be.  Every dollar, even a single dollar, would be a tremendous help to this cause.</p>
<p>Any monies raised, even if the goal is not reached, will go towards the van. If you are not comfortable donating on-line, donations are being accepted at any TD Bank (all along the northern east-coast) in the name of ""Jacob's Fund"".</p>
<p><br/>***On July 8th, the Gloucester County Times did a nice article on all the efforts going in to help Jake.

<p>To view the most recent updates about our fundriaser, Lara's prognosis, progress and more click the link below:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lara-is/x/3059846?c=activity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lara-is/x/3059846?c=activity</a></p>
<h2 style=""background-color: #1eb9c1; color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 10px; letter-spacing: .04em;"">LARA'S STORY:</h2>
<p>When Lara was diagnosed with cataracts, which is extremely rare for someone her age, she was told she would need surgery within about a year before she would be considered legally blind. That was exactly one year ago. Her insurance plan doesn't cover vision, and she is unable to afford the surgery on her own, she has tried everything: she's contacted insurance companies, but they wouldn't cover her pre-existing condition; government health programs (Medical/Medicare/HWLA), but she didn't meet the qualifications; non-profit organizations (Mission Cataract USA/Lions Eye), she's still working on this but so far no luck and she's running out of time! Day by day Lara's eyesight is deteriorating. With no other options, Lara has contacted surgeons in the US, Mexico, and Thailand searching for the most affordable and safe option - this is where you and our Indiegogo fundraiser come in. We can't let Lara go blind! Cataracts are completely correctable, and we need your help to raise money for Lara's cataract surgery. We're committed to raising $14,000 so Lara can get surgery in the USA and our beautiful friend can continue to share her view of the world. All amounts help! Please pass this on and give the gift of sight!</p>
<h2 style=""background-color: #1eb9c1; color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 10px; letter-spacing: .04em;"">A NOTE FROM LARA:</h2>
<p>First and foremost, I want to thank everyone who has helped to create this video and fundrasing campaign.  Much love and gratitude to all of you for volunteering your time, talent, skills and expertise.  You're my heros! </p>
<p>I'd also like to express my gratitude and thanks in advance to everyone who supports, shares and/or contributes to this fundraiser in any way.  My heartfelt thanks to you for taking the time to care and for giving me hope for a brighter, and clearer, future. </p>
<p>I've become so accustomed to not being able to see well that I can't quite imagine what it will be like to see clearly again.  To be able to read a book (or read anything without a magnifying glass), create art, play my guitar, read music, make jewelry, feel comfortable driving my car or riding my bike again, these are all things that are easy to take for granted until you can't do them anymore.  Losing my eyesight has meant losing the ability to do things that I love; it's created challenges in performing work related tasks and even normal daily functions but it has also taught me to appreciate the simplest of things in new and profound ways. I've only just begun to fantasize about all the things I'll be able to do again after my surgery, as it's only now seeming like a reality.  And I can't wait!  Thanks to the help and support of so many wonderful people I believe that the end, and a new beginning, is indeed in sight:) With all my love and gratitude - THANK YOU!!!  xxLara<strong><em><br/></em></strong></p>
<h2 style=""background-color: #1eb9c1; color: white; background-position: initial initial; background-repeat: initial initial; padding: 10px; letter-spacing: .04em;"">YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS</h2>
<p>Thank you in advance for your contributions and support.  It is deeply appreciated and guaranteed to bring you good Karma:)  100% of your contribution will support Lara's cataract surgery and related expenses. </p>
<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> Lara's actual surgery is estimated to cost $12k ($6k per eye), however, we've raised our fundraising goal to $14,000 to help cover the Indiegogo processing fees and other related expenses such as loss of work during Lara's post surgery recovery, etc.</p>
<p><em><strong>Please Note: <em><em><strong>PAYPAL payments are preferred (if possbile)</strong></em></em>. </strong></em>Time is of the essence! Our goal is for Lara to get surgery on one eye as soon as possible. Indiegogo gives you the option to contribute via Paypal or credit card.  Paypal payments are preferred (if possbile) because contributions will be available to us within a few days so we can begin the process toward getting Lara surgery on the first eye sooner, rather than later.   You can also use a credit card on Paypal even if you don't have a Paypal account.  All non-Paypal contributions made to our Indiegogo fundraiser won't be received until two weeks after our fundraiser deadline expires.  </p>

<p>Lara's doctor thinks she was probably born with cataracts and it just took time for them to materialize.  Cataracts are often hereditary and Lara's sister was born with a congenital cataract, which has left her blind in one eye since childhood.  Lara's father also has cataracts so you can basically do the math.  In any case, the good news is that cataracts are now 100% correctible so Lara is lucky in that regard.  But, the fact that Lara has cataracts in both eyes makes her situation more challenging.  A person can function pretty darn well with one good eye, as Lara's sister has proven her whole life, but the fact that Lara has cataracts in both eyes makes surgery an absolute MUST.  At least for one eye, but she needs the surgery in both eyes.  </p>
<p><strong>A NOTE ON SURGERY COSTS:</strong> $12k is the average price range we've been quoted by numerous doctors in California. An approximation of costs is all the doctors have been able to give us without personally examining Lara themselves. Typical cataract surgery costs can range between $3,800 - $7,000 per eye.  Because Lara also has an astigmatism, which must be corrected in order for the cataract surgery to work, Lara's surgery will be in the higher range. Additional related costs incurred will include the donation processing fees for Indiegogo/Paypal/Credit Cards, travel expenses (if required to travel) and loss of work during the post surgery recovery time. (Recovery time can vary between 1 week to 30 days and each eye has to be operated on seperately so Lara could be in recovery for as little as 2 weeks or as much as 60 days.) </p>
<p>Ultimately, our goal is to raise the full $14k so that Lara will be able to get her surgery in the USA.  Our plan is to identify two or three doctors that we've been referred to and try to negotiate the best price we can get.  Plan B would mean Lara would have to get surgery in Mexico or Thailand.<em><em><br/></em></em></p>

LARA'S STORY:
When Lara was diagnosed with cataracts, which is extremely rare for someone her age, she was told she would need surgery within about a year before she would be considered legally blind. That was exactly one year ago. Her insurance plan doesn't cover vision, and she is unable to afford the surgery on her own, she has tried everything: she's contacted insurance companies, but they wouldn't cover her pre-existing condition; government health programs (Medical/Medicare/HWLA), but she didn't meet the qualifications; non-profit organizations (Mission Cataract USA/Lions Eye), she's still working on this but so far no luck and she's running out of time! Day by day Lara's eyesight is deteriorating. With no other options, Lara has contacted surgeons in the US, Mexico, and Thailand searching for the most affordable and safe option - this is where you and our Indiegogo fundraiser come in. We can't let Lara go blind! Cataracts are completely correctable, and we need your help to raise money for Lara's cataract surgery. We're committed to raising $14,000 so Lara can get surgery in the USA and our beautiful friend can continue to share her view of the world. All amounts help! Please pass this on and give the gift of sight!
A NOTE FROM LARA:
First and foremost, I want to thank everyone who has helped to create this video and fundrasing campaign.  Much love and gratitude to all of you for volunteering your time, talent, skills and expertise.  You're my heros! 
I'd also like to express my gratitude and thanks in advance to everyone who supports, shares and/or contributes to this fundraiser in any way.  My heartfelt thanks to you for taking the time to care and for giving me hope for a brighter, and clearer, future. 
I've become so accustomed to not being able to see well that I can't quite imagine what it will be like to see clearly again.  To be able to read a book (or read anything without a magnifying glass), create art, play my guitar, read music, make jewelry, feel comfortable driving my car or riding my bike again, these are all things that are easy to take for granted until you can't do them anymore.  Losing my eyesight has meant losing the ability to do things that I love; it's created challenges in performing work related tasks and even normal daily functions but it has also taught me to appreciate the simplest of things in new and profound ways. I've only just begun to fantasize about all the things I'll be able to do again after my surgery, as it's only now seeming like a reality.  And I can't wait!  Thanks to the help and support of so many wonderful people I believe that the end, and a new beginning, is indeed in sight:) With all my love and gratitude - THANK YOU!!!  xxLara
YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS
Thank you in advance for your contributions and support.  It is deeply appreciated and guaranteed to bring you good Karma:)  100% of your contribution will support Lara's cataract surgery and related expenses. 
Please Note: Lara's actual surgery is estimated to cost $12k ($6k per eye), however, we've raised our fundraising goal to $14,000 to help cover the Indiegogo processing fees and other related expenses such as loss of work during Lara's post surgery recovery, etc.
Please Note: PAYPAL payments are preferred (if possbile). Time is of the essence! Our goal is for Lara to get surgery on one eye as soon as possible. Indiegogo gives you the option to contribute via Paypal or credit card.  Paypal payments are preferred (if possbile) because contributions will be available to us within a few days so we can begin the process toward getting Lara surgery on the first eye sooner, rather than later.   You can also use a credit card on Paypal even if you don't have a Paypal account.  All non-Paypal contributions made to our Indiegogo fundraiser won't be received until two weeks after our fundraiser deadline expires.

<p>I have treatable cancer. I am uninsured and need your help.</p>
<p>Why do I need your help?

My wife's group through her employer is quite small and therefore unaffordable for me as well. I will have to wait approximately another 10 months to enroll in my own employer's group which is quite substandard insurance to begin with.... I don't have time to spare.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are 'pre-existing conditions' which hinder securing health insurance. Again, I've already been diagnosed with a type of cancer which is completely treatable providing I'm able to find financing and get treatment SOON - like YESTERDAY. That's where my friends, friends of friends of friends, etc. donate what you might afford toward helping me receive timely treatment.</p>
<p>Here's the treatment I need (that I'm aware of so far):<br/>-surgery on my tongue to remove malignant lesion<br/>-reconstructive surgery<br/>-plus all the testing, hospital admission(s), medications, and office visits.</p>
<p>For now, the ENT surgeon is asking for $7,000 before surgery. I will keep everybody updated and ask for funds in steps as needed (?)</p>

<p>In January of 2012 our beloved space at the corner of 207th and Broadway suffered a devastating fire destroying the studio and all its contents.

Bread and Yoga was founded in 2009 with the mission of serving Inwood, a vibrant community in Northern Manhattan. With a focus on health and creative expression as a path to wellness, Bread and Yoga offers yoga, cooking and nutrition classes, art classes, community events and a comprehensive after-school program. Bread and Yoga is a small business dedicated to nurturing the vitality of its community and bringing people together.





In January of 2012 our beloved space at the corner of 207th and Broadway suffered a devastating fire destroying the studio and all its contents. Since then we’ve operated out of a temporary space at Holy Trinity Church and have stayed up and running thanks in large part to the tremendous generosity of our supporters and friends.
After 18 months of looking for a new space we will soon be ready to move into our new home at 5000 Broadway.  This is a time of reconstruction, celebration and a declaration to the Inwood community that we are here to stay!
The funds raised in this campaign will help us create a new haven, a space where we can come together, share thoughts and take a personal stake in improving ourselves and our neighborhood. Small businesses like Bread and Yoga are the heart and soul of any community and your contribution will celebrate the idea that we're truly all in it together.


A GOOD OLD FASHIONED COMMUNITY BARN RAISING!

<p>When I reached 20 years of age I still thought I was the only one who felt this way :) My parents wanted me to study agriculture in university, and although I wanted to study arts, I obliged.

I left agriculture and took the exam for the arts department. Out of 650 applicants the department took 10 people, I placed 3rd, I was happy. </p>
<p>My family was furious and my parents decided to punish me by not sending any money. While trying to study and earn money at the same time, I learned to stand on my own and got increasingly detached from my family. After graduation, I moved to Istanbul. I found out about LGBTTI associations and started to get into lgbt activism. I was trying to find work but was constantly being rejected because of my appearance. With the incentive of my friends I started doing tattoo work. I have been a voluntary activist of Istanbul LGBTT and Lambda Istanbul associations for three years. I focus on trans issues and hate crime/murders. Recently I joined up with a few trans friends and together we founded Transblog association. In Turkey being transgendered is difficult and trans people are subject to maltreatment from the society, the police and the government unfortunately.. Each year in Turkey more than 20 trans women are killed, most of them during sex work. A lot of trans women are forced into sex work as they can't find jobs. I don't want to be a sex worker nor have the courage, being trans and being a sex worker is very difficult.. Doing tattoos, I am able to only pay for my living, basic expenses, I don't earn enough for further transition. With your help, I can realize my dream of further transitioning into a woman and undergo the surgeries I need..</p>

<h4>Our journey:</h4><p>Hello, My name is Jay Trice, my fiancé and I are the founders and owners of JAWS Hydroponics. We
are a small home based business in Atlanta, Ga. that supplies accessible,
affordable and efficient indoor garden cabinets and supplies.</p>
<p>I am a L-1 paraplegic
and bilateral amputee, who loves reading, writing, the outdoors and
gardening.<span>  Unfortunately due to my disability
and location, maintaining a garden outside is virtually impossible. So my fiancé and I set out on a journey to bring
our passion indoors. We first started by purchasing an Aerogarden, which worked
for small herbs and the occasional tomato here and there but we wanted to grow
more and also did not care for the bright light that the Aerogarden emitted in our
dining room/kitchen. So after a lot of researching, frustration and trial &amp;
error we built our first indoor garden cabinet . It performed great, we were
able to grow fresh strawberries that were not suppose to produce in their first
season, in about 60 days!</span></p>
<p>We knew then that we
were on to something. I was able to garden independently and easily in my own
home. I knew if I
could achieve great results with the system anyone could. The Galaxy Indoor
Garden was born. We began to produce all the necessary components needed to
operate the unit in our small home office. We handcrafted each cabinet<span>  and each Oxy-Pot needed to grow
hydroponically which turned our small home office into a workshop.</span></p>
<p>I then did more
research and learned how to own and operate our website.<span>  We continued to improve our design and sold a
few cabinets here and there. We then tried our hand at selling on EBay, it was
a great experience but the fees were really holding back our progress. So we
are now trying to operate independently, continue to innovate and provide the
best quality cabinet possible.</span></p><h4><span>Our goals:</span></h4><ul>
<li>Convert our garage into a larger more accessible workshop</li>
<li>Further improve our Galaxy Indoor Gardens with a better R&amp;D budget<br/>
</li>
<li>Improve our web presence</li>
<li>Continually build our brand into the successful entity we believe it can be</li>
<li>Include ALL of our funders in our journey with email updates, live chats and videos of our progress.</li>
<li>Deliver all funders cabinets before our estimated delivery date<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>We want to provide everyone who has the desire to garden
indoors or even people interested in a new hobby, disabled and able-bodied the
opportunity to own an inexpensive, healthy and efficient way to grow their own
fruits, vegetables and herbs. Thank you for taking the time to get to know us
and we would really appreciate your support in our campaign.</p><br/></div>","Our journey:Hello, My name is Jay Trice, my fiancé and I are the founders and owners of JAWS Hydroponics. We

Suddenly, she heard some movements in the shadows and few seconds later someone attacked her from behind. She started screaming and fighting with the stranger, who tried to close her throat and pull her off the path.

<p>This is one of the many stories that you would hear in Kampong Chhnang Province about robberies, assaults, accidents and supernatural occurrences. Far from the electricity grid, the residents of Kampong Chhnang do their evening activities on the dark streets and rural terrain. The cost to connect the village to the country’s electricity grid goes up to millions of dollars leaving darkness as their only option. <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/commlight-for-cambodia/x/3633393?c=gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">View the interview with Keo Phonn</a>, a resident of the Kampong Chhnang Province.</p>
<h3><strong>Together, We Can Change Their Reality.</strong></h3>
<p>We founded Fosera Lighting as a Spin-Off company from the Solar Energy Research Institute of Singapore (SERIS) and decided to come up with a cheaper, long-lasting solution to address the basic need of street and community lighting. After two years of intensive research we have developed COMMLIGHT® as an independent lighting system that is easy-to-install at any location not connected by the grid.</p>
<p>For our first project, we are working in partnership with the NGOs BoP Hub and WTO (World Toilet Organisation) in a<strong> wholly non-profit campaign</strong> to kick-start our first production batch, wherof 75 COMMLIGHT® units will be installed under this project at the Kampong Chhnang Province.</p>

My parents were going through a divorce and as the youngest of 5 kids that tore my whole world apart. I turned to food. I don't know what it was about the food that was so appealing to me, I think it was because at that time it was the only thing I could control. By the time I was 16, and 220lbs, it controlled me. I was no sooner finished with one meal before I was thinking about and planning my next. I would go to fast food restaurants and order several meals and pretend I was bringing them home to other people, but it was all for me. I tried every diet known to man and nothing worked long term because nothing fixed my emotional attachment to food and what it did for me mentally. It made me happy to eat, it fulfilled something lacking in my life.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Planting Seeds Elementary School program uses the practice of yoga and meditation to teach students essential skills and values for a lifetime of health and wellness. Students learn to manage the stresses of everyday life, finding healthy ways to express their emotions and find mental clarity. Students develop a strong appreciation for community, and they are empowered to support their peers, their family, their school  and their Austin community. Students gain confidence, enthusiasm and non-competitiveness which enables them to succeed physically, academically and creatively. </span><br/></p>

By supporting Community Yoga Austin and our Planting Seeds Elementary School Program you will receive a unique gift to express our gratitude for your generous contribution to healing communities across the city of Austin, Texas. 
Gifts include: 


Recognition on our website  and Facebook page as a noted supporter

A Community-Yoga Austin t-shirt, tote bag and custom tea blend

Exclusive links to online yoga and meditation classes led by our talented program directors and staff
A private yoga and meditation class for your and your friends led by our talented program staff (for local contributors only). 






The Impact
The Planting Seeds Elementary School program uses the practice of yoga and meditation to teach students essential skills and values for a lifetime of health and wellness. Students learn to manage the stresses of everyday life, finding healthy ways to express their emotions and find mental clarity. Students develop a strong appreciation for community, and they are empowered to support their peers, their family, their school  and their Austin community. Students gain confidence, enthusiasm and non-competitiveness which enables them to succeed physically, academically and creatively. 
During 2012,  Community Yoga provided more than 450 classes to members in our community.

<h3>Unstoppable Movember Campaign</h3>
<p>This is not your average Movember campaign - as of this writing, I have raised a whopping $0!  It's probably because I'm as cool as you think I am or maybe because this mustache I'm wearing scares small children but nevertheles, I need your help because the world is too good for prostate cancer and it needs to be stopped!</p>
<p>This disease is out of control.  I lost my grandpa this year.  He had prostate cancer and we can't have men dealing with this disease any longer. </p>
<p>My other motivation is that I need to give my wife a reason for wearing this wonderful caterpillar on my face and zero dollars isn't exactly cutting it!</p>
<p>As little as $1 would be so appreciated.  If 1,000 of you were to be so generous my self-esteem could reach Kanye West levels in no time, but as of today, I really don't know what do do with myself.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
For your generosity, I can offer you a good laugh!  Check out my campaign video and at least feel sorry for me but more importantly, contribute to stop the spread of prostate cancer.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>To highlight the importance of what I am doing, take a look at these statistics: <br/> •  1 in 6 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in their lifetime <br/> •  This year 242,000 new cases of prostate cancer will be diagnosed <br/> •  This year 8,290 men will be diagnosed with testicular cancer</p>
<h3>How to Help</h3>

<p>TimeGiven S.O.S. Watch is a product that provides quick emergency messages.</p>
<p>It is made as a watch and has a limited number of functions. It is not a smart watch, which in turn makes it possible to function very functionally for all systems providing the conditions for emergency calls in the event of acute conditions.</p>

<p>S.O.S. Watch is equipped with the most advanced sensors manufactured, an e-Ink<br/>display, touch sensitive buttons and the latest communication system technology NB-IoT, which makes it possible to directly send messages to contact persons about emergency conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Without using a SIM card, without duplicating these messages via smartphones.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Cardio sensor</strong> working on the laser principle of reading heart beats.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fall sensor</strong> that allows you to fixate a drop in six vectors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Up to 140 messages can be sent per day</strong>, and depending on the programming, all the information accumulated as a result of taking sensor readings can be sent to the server as a database for storing this person. (Optional)</li>

</div></div>","TimeGiven S.O.S. Watch is a product that provides quick emergency messages.
It is made as a watch and has a limited number of functions. It is not a smart watch, which in turn makes it possible to function very functionally for all systems providing the conditions for emergency calls in the event of acute conditions.
 

S.O.S. Watch is equipped with the most advanced sensors manufactured, an e-Inkdisplay, touch sensitive buttons and the latest communication system technology NB-IoT, which makes it possible to directly send messages to contact persons about emergency conditions.
Without using a SIM card, without duplicating these messages via smartphones.


Cardio sensor working on the laser principle of reading heart beats.

Fall sensor that allows you to fixate a drop in six vectors.

Up to 140 messages can be sent per day, and depending on the programming, all the information accumulated as a result of taking sensor readings can be sent to the server as a database for storing this person. (Optional)

Communication between the sensors is connected by computer software, which makes it possible, in case of emergency, to ensure the operation of the sensors in such a way that they automatically send a message to the contact persons.
The watch is equipped with two buttons:
One button - The Menu
It has three indicators: heart rate mode, clock mode, battery level.
 
Second button - SOS
When pressed, a message is sent within 0.2 seconds.
 

In case of an emergency, the message will contain the following information:

The time of the message.
It will be written that emergency assistance is required.
The readings of the GPS sensor (coordinates).
The heart rate (bpm).

 


 

There is choice to add additional features for extra charges. Features that can be added are:

Pedometer.
Oxygen meter.
Calorie counter.
Sleep sensor.

 


 

 
When we were creating the second and the third prototypes, various test groups of 25-40 people participated, which made it possible to test the prototype and further improve its functionality and lay the foundation for the production of the final product.
When developing and testing the second and the third prototypes, we used the recommendations of cardiologists, emergency doctors, family physicians and social workers.

Based on the third prototype, from 09.2020 until the end of 2020, the production and sale of the S.O.S. Watch product will be carried out.
At the moment, we have four theoretical developments of SOS products based on nano-technologies:

for patients with hypertension-hypo-tension;
for patients with diabetes;
for newborns;
for children and teenagers.

 
At the moment, there are
no analogues of these watches
in the world.
There are companies that offer separate similar functions in smartphones, but in essence they are not functional and do not correspond to the understanding of the SOS function.

But when you are out bustling, who's there to safeguard your air quality? The situation is direr than ever, keeping your air quality clean is the number one priority.   Cars, coffee shops, workspaces or your nearby gardens, these seemingly harm-free places are likely filled with harmful substances. It's easy to overlook the importance of air quality when it's something so intangible. Think of the number of harmful particles that could be brewing in your crowded coffee shop. The pet dander from Bob, your beloved pet. The pollen from the nearby park. It's literally everywhere.    Your home air purifier can only cover so much. When you need to get mobile, you’re going to need something more portable.That brings us to PURUS Air i Plus, your personal air quality guardian. We crammed every possible bit of tech into this itty bitty package. No matter how tough your surroundings get, it's always there to make you breathe better.  It has three essential features that we believe is most important when it comes to personal air purifiers. 
 Purify the Air Around You 
 Always Monitoring 
Pretty Darn Portable
  Think of it as a virtual shield that purifies the surrounding air within 1 meter diameter. The 45-degree flow directing structure of PURUS Air i Plus coupled with a powerful turbofan creates a vortex, accelerating clean air delivery. Germs as well as molds, dander, pollen and other tiny particles can all be effectively removed through the process.  Epidemiologists suggest that air borne transmission or contact with mucous membranes are most likely to happen within one meter. Families with kids and office environments are especially crucial battle fronts to prevent disease transmission. It takes PURUS Air i Plus just 5 minutes to ensure that your personal space is stir cleared of potentially harmful substances. 
  PURUS Air i Plus comes equipped with an air quality sensor that always monitors your surrounding air quality. It automatically adjusts its intensity based on the environment. No matter where you go, you'll always be aware of the surrounding air quality. 
  With the size of a 600ml / 20oz water bottle, you can practically carry PURUS Air i Plus everywhere you go. Think your backpack side pocket, your fancy designer bag, or simply the cup holder on your vehicle. Its small form factor is also greatly beneficial to compact spaces that are usually hard to reach. It’s perfect for places like the corner of a wardrobe or bedside.  The minimalist look and compact size of PURUS Air i Plus makes it unnoticeable in most environments. It's always there in the background doing the heavy lifting for you, ensuring the optimal air quality. It is the most reliable companion to keep with you wherever you go. The exclusive technology inside PURUS Air i Plus effectively eliminates pollen, dust mites, PM 2.5, pet dander, mold and other tiny harmful particles in the air, down to 0.01 microns.  Here at PURUS, we don’t just talk the talk, we back up our claims with patented technologies, scientific tests, and real hard evidence. So without further ado, here’s some in depth look on how we achieve PURUS’s unmatched performance.  Our exclusive patented stainless steel spiral wire-on-plate (instead of tungsten wire) forms plasma discharge with 42 electrodes, creating a long pathway for all harmful particles. In comparison to traditional electrostatic precipitators, particles have a much higher chance to be attached by electro discharge and encounter collision.  Through a process of plasma discharge, we apply as much as 4000 volts to our patented spiral wire-on-plate, killing harmful particles. The high voltage, in turn, charges the air electrically and ionizes it in the process. When small particles including pollen, dust or dander flow between the plate, they get charged and attached to the collecting plate. This method could effectively eliminate 99% of the airborne particles and germs.Here is an experiment we did to showcase the effectiveness of PURUS’s ability to prevent molds. Same environment, same loaf of bread, but results were dramatically different.   A lot of electrostatic precipitators would claim that they are ""reusable"" or ""filter free"". But in reality, the tungsten wire that is often used in traditional electrostatic precipitators would often break prematurely during the cleaning process due to oxidation caused by electric current. With our patented spiral wire-on-plate structure made of stainless steel, you can clean and wash off particles with confidence. You can simply pop off the plate every now and then, and wipe it clean with a cloth.Your typical electrostatic precipitator has limited electrode wires in the discharge zone due to the nature of thin metal wire used for charging, thus generating a higher concentration of ozone. PURUS Air i Plus utilizes a high-density spiral wire-on-plate structure to achieve plasma discharge, effectively lowers the ozone emission rate and improves efficiency.  
  Traditional HEPA filters need to be replaced at a minimum of 6-12 months, and in areas with more serious pollution, the life span may be as short as 3 months. Furthermore, the harmful particles are not eliminated, they’re simply being trapped in another space, leaving concerns for potential secondary pollutants. In fact, it's neither cheap nor safe to use HEPA air purifiers.  
  Unlike filter-based air purifiers, PURUS Air i Plus uses a durable stainless steel dust collecting plate, which can be scrubbed, rinsed, wiped and reused. You'll never have to pay any subscription fee or spend a dime on costly filter replacements.   
 Intuitive Speed ControlSwitch between 3 presets for different speeds. There's also a 10-level intensity toggle on the app for a more personalized experience.  Mute ButtonWith a push of a button, PURUS Air i Plus will lower its intensity, making as low as 25 decibels. This is equivalent to leaves rustling on the ground. We make sure that when PURUS is operating, you can remain undisturbed when you’re sleeping. Easily turn off the LED monitor through the app to avoid distraction at night.    Auto TurboPURUS Air i Plus adjusts automatically according to the surrounding environment. If the environment you’re located at is hazardous, it will activate turbo mode to accelerate the clean air delivery rate.  
  Our testing has shown that 10 hours of continuous operation, PURUS Air i Plus only consumed as low as 3 watts.  
  Powered by a 5V DC to USB cable, it's compatible with power banks, laptops and car chargers. Your access to clean air is no longer limited by wall plugs.  
 Cup Holder Mount
  Comes with a reusable pod to further extend the functionality of your PURUS! Fill it with activated carbon, zeolite or other materials to remove VOCs, odor like cigarette smell.     PURUS Air i Plus has been tested vigorously before going into the market, here are some stats to back up our claims.

<p>The cool thing about ROXs is that kids can use their imagination to set up their <b>own rules</b>. One kid might just want to play ROXs on the floor, another one might want to strap a ROXs to a tree so that there is a jumping movement. Or kids come up with their own rules, for example that you have to <b>jump like a kangaroo</b>.</p>
<p>This is one of the main take-aways that we have from our <b>testings</b> that we conducted with <b>more than 250 kids</b>: What they really love about ROXs is that no game has to be the same.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Pure Action for young and old, couch potatoes and even athletes. </b></p>
<p>Even though ROXs is originally made for kids 6-10 it is in fact a game that can be played by the<b> complete family</b>. ROXs can be played alone, against each other or in group settings. We played it as warm up in CrossFit sessions and saw it being used in athlete's training. PE teachers love ROXs because they can use it to spice up their classes. Remember Capture the Flag? In <b>2016</b> it is <b>Capture ROXs</b>. </p>
<p>Kids love the product because it’s pure fun and action. And it’s a toy that both sporty and tech-savvy parents will feel good about giving to their kids. It’s a great gift for girls, boys and families.</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465463454/2016-06-07_V00_ROXs_cool_scenarios-LR-28_oldgwm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<b>And here is what experts say about ROXs:</b><p><i>“The things I like the most about ROXs are that it can be played in all types of environments, it encourages healthy competition and creativity, and <b>it’s a digital game that is not a screen</b>.”</i><br/>Ben Regan, <b>Physical Education Specialist</b>, Brent International School Manila</p>
<p><i>""What I find compelling about A-Champs is that while there’s a growing market for digital toys, there does not appear to be any or much real competition for a <b>line of toys that gets kids really moving, playing, sweating, laughing</b>, etc..”</i><br/>Stephen Gass, <b>Play expert</b>, President the GASS company</p>
<p><i>""It's really <b>fun and exhausting</b>. I beat my brother who is 2 years older. ”</i><br/>Ciara S., <b>age 8</b></p>

<p><b>Developing a tech toy like ROXs is hard</b>. It takes a lot of time, skills, experience, resources, the right suppliers and lots of patience. Good that we know what we are doing.</p>
<p>Developing and manufacturing products that can be found on the shelves of the biggest global retailers is our daily job <b>since more than 8 years</b>.</p>
<p>Our vision to bring something to the market that helps to fight the kids inactivity epidemic exists already since quite a few years. But it took until 2014 to finally put together the team, resources, energy and focus to kick off the project.</p>
<p>Since then we have an international team of <b>6 people working fulltime</b> on bringing ROXs to life. What makes our team great is that we have <b>complementary skills</b> in Industrial Design, Mechanical- and Electro-Engineering, Software Development, Production Management and International Marketing.</p>
<p>But at the end it is not so much about having a smart and great team on paper: it’s about <b>being experienced</b> in how to design, develop and test a product that actually <b>can be mass-produced</b>. For a reasonable price.  And then it is about being able to coordinate and manage a mass-production and to deliver a product that fulfills all market requirements and customer expectations. And this is our <b>core competency</b>.</p>
<p>The lack of this comprehensive knowledge is the reason why a lot of other hardware start-ups struggle. And it is also the reason why you - our backers - can <b>rest assured </b>that we are capable of delivering ROXs to you. </p>

<p>A-Champs - the brand behind ROXs - is a <b>spin-off</b> of both of those organizations.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Development status</b></p>
<p> </p> Based on our production background we have <b>integrated the manufacturing perspective</b> right from the very beginning of the development process. </div>
<div>Whatever we came up with during our concept phase was firstly <b>validated for producibility</b> and for compliance to safety, stability, testing, cost and usability requirements. </div>
<div>
<p>This process is painful and takes time, but it <b>eliminates the risk</b> of developing something that finally can't be brought to market. </p>
<p>We spent the last 2 years plus all our savings to bring ROXs to life. Now, the <b>development is finished</b>, molds, hard- and software are ready and the manufacturer - with whom we already work since many years - is only waiting to get the go-ahead to start producing.</p>

<p>In 2008 Kilian and his wife Anika (both German) moved to China to start up a manufacturing and product development company. While the business quickly picked up Anika fell ill with breast cancer in 2008.</p>
<p>After a year of hardship and turmoil, the cancer fortunately went into remission. Sadly, according to doctor’s evaluation, the couple’s three planned children, <b>“Rocco”, “Fritz” &amp; “Bo”</b> won’t be possible due to Anika’s heavy exposure to chemotherapy treatment.</p>
<p>The positive thing of the story is a newly heightened awareness about the need to live a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Around the same time Kilian received a customer inquiry for a foam dumbbell set for kids, to emphasize the importance of working out at a young age. <b>“What a terrible idea”</b> he thought to himself, but his interest was sparked.</p>
<p>What other kinds of “kids fitness” products exist on the market? He searched, but he was unable to find any viable solutions that really engages children into being active. His excitement rose as he dived deeper into the topic to find that there was an opportunity to combine his existing business with his concern for a healthy lifestyle.  </p>
<p>Pretty soon the vision was clear: to finally bring to the market a solution to get kids moving. The idea for A-Champs - a global brand that <b>helps kids to set the foundations for an active and thus healthy lifestyle</b> - was born.</p>
<p>A crucial element of the A-Champs vision is to integrate a social component to the company by supporting a relevant non-profit organization. By doing so Kilian wants to thank the world for the most blessed gift it could have given him: his lovely, healthy wife gave birth to two beautiful baby girls named <b>Polly &amp; Pippa</b>.</p>

<p align=""center""><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p><b><i>Development &amp; Manufacturing:</i></b> Developing and manufacturing products is our daily business since 8 years. Our development team is located in Shanghai, China, in the heart of the world's factory. </p>
<p>Our team is producing for the biggest global retailers since years and is able to perform according to strict quality, delivery time and social compliance requirements. The development of ROXs is done hand in hand with the manufacturer. Surprises relating to a gap between development expectations and producability realities - one of the major reasons why other hardware projects fail - can be eliminated. </p>
<p>Reliability issues and challenges due to ""cultural differences"" between Western and Chinese ways of doing business can be avoided due to the fact that we already work with our manufacturing partners for several years. Plus we've all had our fair share of learning experiences (grey hair included) in the earlier years of our ventures manufacturing in China.  </p>
<p><b><i>Shipment and Fullfillment: </i></b>Here we are working together with well established international freight forwarders as well as local order fullfillment houses that understand to ""drop ship"" product directly to the end consumer. We leave this part to the logistics pros.   </p>
<p><b><i>Marketing: </i></b>This is our weak point. So far we have been focusing on the development of the product rather than talking about it. And that's exactly why we are here: Please help us to reach out to as  as many people as possible and let them know about ROXs and our mission to <b>#GetKidsMoving</b>.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>When / where can I buy ROXs?</b></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;"">ROXs is available for purchase via our Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign starting June 13th, 2016.</p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;""> </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Is ROXs only for kids? And how many players can play?</b></p>
<p>ROXs was created for kids ages six and up. But we found that it is a game for the complete family. Kids of all ages as well as grown-ups like the run, jump and play action. ROXs can support up to 50 individual players. You can either play by yourself, 1:1 against your friends or in a group. We have group play classics like Capture the ROXs and Zombie tag. And even the tap &amp; go games can be played in a group. There are no limits, your imagination rules.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can ROXs be customized?</b></p>
<p>One of the cool things about ROXs is that you can customize the game-play according to your rules. For example by increasing the distance between ROXs 2 players with different fitness levels can compete against each other. In this way both players can go to their maximum. There is no need for running half-throttle. ROXs can be placed anywhere within a 3,000sqft area and with the straps and holsters that come with ROXs they can be fixed to almost anything. Up to 50 ROXs can be added to the main game console for endless options.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Where can ROXs be played?</b></p>
<p>ROXs can be play indoors and outdoors, day and night, all year round. Any time, any place.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What are ROXs made of?</b></p>
<p>ROXs are made of ultra strong, safe materials. The ROXs top is made of the same material as jet fighter canopies (PC), the body is made of an ultra-strong plastic (ABS mixed with PC). The holsters are made out of silicone. All materials are virgin (=not recycled), which means they are safe and comply with strictest chemical standards.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How strong are ROXs?</b></p>
<p>ROXs are made to last. We know that kids will play rough with ROXs, so we made them extra strong. When constructing the shape, stability considerations were key. Kids can step on ROXs and ROXs can be hit with different kinds of balls. The material selection supports our stability and quality focus. Only super strong (and safe) materials are used.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can more ROXs be added to a controller? </b></p>
<p>Sure. Up to 30 ROXs can be added to one control unit.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Are ROXs waterproof?</b></p>
<p>No, they are not waterproof. The construction is designed to protect the interior from rain and dirt. The electronics inside are especially coated to be corrosion and water repellent. So if you leave them out for a night - ROXs will be fine. But do not throw them into the swimming pool.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What is the play range?</b></p>
<p>For most of the games you can place ROXs up to 40 feet apart from the controller. That means if you are playing with the ROXs BOX set (3ROXs) you can have a game area of around 3,000sqft (40ft x 80ft if you place them in a triangle shape with the master between 2 ROXs). For some games like Zombie tag and other tag games there are no range limitations. You can play from Alaska to Key West (better bring some healthy snacks).</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How do I turn on ROXs? </b></p>
<p>Turn on the controller by pressing the middle button and wait until all ROXs blink in blue color. Then tap those ROXs that you want to use for the game. After you tapped them, they will turn green, indicating that the controller “registered” them. If a ROXs does not turn green when tapping it means that this ROXs is out of reach of the controller. You then have to place this ROXs closer to the controller.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can there be more games?</b></p>
<p>Yes, the software that powers ROXs is dynamic, so it can be upgrade at any time. This also refers to games, new games can be downloaded via <a href=""http://www.playroxs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.playroxs.com</a> once the website platform is completed. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I adjust the volume?</b></p>
<p>Of course. There are 15 different sound volumes available.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I adjust the lights?</b></p>
<p>No, the light configuration is currently fixed to the relevant games.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How do they communicate?</b></p>
<p>ROXs communicate via RF (Radio Frequency).</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What can they detect?</b></p>
<p>There are different smart sensors inside ROXs. They can detect motion, vibration, rotation and tapping. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What languages?</b></p>
<p>Currently the language on ROXs is English, but we are already working on 6 other languages.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Do ROXs work with an App?</b></p>
<p>No, ROXs is designed to work without the help of any smartphones, tablets or other screens. We want kids to get away from screens for some time.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How are ROXs powered? Do they run on batteries?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Each ROXs as well as the master controller run on 3 x AA batteries. The batteries are not included in the initial set.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Can I use rechargeable batteries?</b></p>
<p>Of course. We even integrated a recharging module in ROXs, so if you use rechargeable batteries you do not need to take the batteries out when they need to be charged. Just use an USB cable to connect to a power source and the charging can happen.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How long do the batteries last?</b></p>
<p>You can play around 12 hours with one set of batteries.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Do I need more ROXs if we are more players? </b></p>
<p>No. Most of the games can be played perfectly with the initial amount of 3 ROXs (or 5 ROXs for the ROXs Super BOX). For the tag games you can add more ROXs if you want to play with more than 3 players (5 for the ROXs Super BOX). In total you can add up to 30 ROXs to a controller.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>How many colors are available?</b></p>
<p>Currently ROXs come in 1 color. The selection of the color is based on the feedback of more than 300 children, boys as well as girls. During our Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign we will also offer a limited edition in pure black. Depending on the demand we will be able to offer additional colors soon.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>What's up with the chicken?</b></p>
<p>The chicken is not your average chicken. It is the crazy chicken, the main character of our signature game “Crazy Chicken”. It used to work in an office but got bored staring at a screen all day long. Now it is with us and makes kids RUN, JUMP and PLAY like crazy.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>If I have 2 sets, can I combine all the ROXs? </b></p>
<p>Yes, you can combine all the ROXs from up to 10 ROXs BOXes and integrate them into one big set. 1 controller will then control them. It is not possible (and not useful) to combine different controllers.  </p>
<p><b>What if both of my kids have a set of ROXs and they want to play simultaneously? Will the sets interfere with each other? </b></p>
<p>No problem. When setting up a set of ROXs you “register” which ROXs should play with which controller. Once this is done the controller will know which ROXs should join the game and which ones should not. </p>

</div></div>","Check out the design of the ROXs BOX. What do you think?    
ROXs uses technology and digital gaming concepts - the two elements that make kids stick in front of screens - to get them to run, move and jump. Unplugged !""..it's like playing Super Mario in the backyard..""   
Why ROXs? The facts are clear: Kids these days don't move enough. They spend way too many hours in front of screens and too little time running, moving and playing around in real life. Everybody is aware of this problem, but so far there are no convincing product solutions that successfully engage millions of U.S. kids in more physical activity. That’s where A-Champs comes into play. The idea is to give kids products that entertain them in the same way video games do – but offline, away from screens. Competing products that claim to achieve the same effect - like kids’ activity trackers - use rewards in form of unlocking online games and activities to stimulate movement. With ROXs the activity itself stimulates kids to get active. This is called intrinsic motivation: kids run, jump and move around because the game is just so much fun. Plus they can use their imagination to set up their own game scenarios. And this is exactly the secret to engaging kids.

TechCrunch: One of the top 5 kids tech finds from CES, ROXs “gets kids physically active in a challenging and fun way.” Mashable: One of the “…coolest gadgets for Generation Z from CES 2016.”Kidoz: A top 5 kids’ gadget from CES: “gets kids moving and playing off-screen.”Popzara: The “sensors are exceptionally durable and withstand being hit, thrown, stepped on and more.” Teachers with Apps: ""It is play based technology at its best.. The possibilities for facilitating visual motor skills are endless, and included is a strap that kids can place the ROXs inside to attach them to a tree, shelf, or themselves. This is one tool designed for moving families and therapy clinics everywhere."" So what is ROXs?  ROXs is the world's first real life gaming console. It consists of wirelessly connected, super durable high-tech pods. Each ROXs has several smart sensors inside and comes with different sound and light effects. The basic set comes with 3 ROXs, a controller with a bunch of pre-programmed games on it and 3 holsters and straps to fix ROXs to any kind of object or person.                                                         How it works      To start to play with ROXs, select a game and one of the 50 player profiles. Then, put ROXs on the floor or use the straps to fix them to any object you can think of.  On go one of the ROXs will start to flash and to make a sound. For example like a Chicken in our Crazy Chicken game. You then have to run to the chicken and tap it. Once you did, another one will start.Here is how to catch the Crazy Chicken:So you are basically running like crazy between those ROXs, trying to catch as many chicken as you can, as fast as you can.The controller counts your time and score so you can try to beat your friends or your own high score. Just like in a video game.The beauty of ROXs is that it is very versatile. There are different game categories: 

In the initial ROXs configuration there are 10 pre-programmed games. The dynamic software inside ROXs makes it possible to download new games lateron. 
 Simple game concepts: easy to learn - hard to master
All ROXs games are deliberately designed to be simple and meant to stimulate informal, active play. 
They do not require a lot of instructions and are in line with the simple game concepts that kids know from their beloved digital games.
 

Imagination rules
The cool thing about ROXs is that kids can use their imagination to set up their own rules. One kid might just want to play ROXs on the floor, another one might want to strap a ROXs to a tree so that there is a jumping movement. Or kids come up with their own rules, for example that you have to jump like a kangaroo.
This is one of the main take-aways that we have from our testings that we conducted with more than 250 kids: What they really love about ROXs is that no game has to be the same.
 
Pure Action for young and old, couch potatoes and even athletes. 
Even though ROXs is originally made for kids 6-10 it is in fact a game that can be played by the complete family. ROXs can be played alone, against each other or in group settings. We played it as warm up in CrossFit sessions and saw it being used in athlete's training. PE teachers love ROXs because they can use it to spice up their classes. Remember Capture the Flag? In 2016 it is Capture ROXs. 
Kids love the product because it’s pure fun and action. And it’s a toy that both sporty and tech-savvy parents will feel good about giving to their kids. It’s a great gift for girls, boys and families. 
And here is what experts say about ROXs:“The things I like the most about ROXs are that it can be played in all types of environments, it encourages healthy competition and creativity, and it’s a digital game that is not a screen.”Ben Regan, Physical Education Specialist, Brent International School Manila
""What I find compelling about A-Champs is that while there’s a growing market for digital toys, there does not appear to be any or much real competition for a line of toys that gets kids really moving, playing, sweating, laughing, etc..”Stephen Gass, Play expert, President the GASS company
""It's really fun and exhausting. I beat my brother who is 2 years older. ”Ciara S., age 8
""Finally something that makes them go out and play like we used to when we were kids!”Angela S., age 38
“Awesome product! Technology and action. I want to have a set for Christmas.”Chris H., age 42
 
 Technical Components & Material Concept
ROXs is powered by latest technology to comply to the tech-saviness of the i-generation. Components are tested against strict chemical requirements, passed aging tests and are specially coated to ensure a superior long term performance.  
Soft- and firmware are developed to be dynamic so that the ROXs system is upgradable and future proof. 
Tech specs:

RF technology for wireless communication
Dynamic software concept that allows users to upload new games to the console
3D sensors
Touch sensors
Multi color RGB LED lights
6W speakers
LCD display for the controller
Recharging mode integrated 

Tough & safe
The material concept supports the high quality approach of ROXs and is based on our yearlong experience in building quality sports, toy and general consumer products. The focus is on safe components and maximum stability. The exclusive use of virgin materials ensures compliance to the most vigorous chemical requirements.

the top of ROXs is made of ultra strong PC, the same materials as used in jet fighters canopies;
the body of ROXs is made of a robust construction and is shock resistant;
the holsters are made of flexible and comfortable to wear silicone material;
exclusive use of safe and tested material components.

 Not your average crowdfunding campaign
Developing a tech toy like ROXs is hard. It takes a lot of time, skills, experience, resources, the right suppliers and lots of patience. Good that we know what we are doing.
Developing and manufacturing products that can be found on the shelves of the biggest global retailers is our daily job since more than 8 years.
Our vision to bring something to the market that helps to fight the kids inactivity epidemic exists already since quite a few years. But it took until 2014 to finally put together the team, resources, energy and focus to kick off the project.
Since then we have an international team of 6 people working fulltime on bringing ROXs to life. What makes our team great is that we have complementary skills in Industrial Design, Mechanical- and Electro-Engineering, Software Development, Production Management and International Marketing.
But at the end it is not so much about having a smart and great team on paper: it’s about being experienced in how to design, develop and test a product that actually can be mass-produced. For a reasonable price.  And then it is about being able to coordinate and manage a mass-production and to deliver a product that fulfills all market requirements and customer expectations. And this is our core competency.
The lack of this comprehensive knowledge is the reason why a lot of other hardware start-ups struggle. And it is also the reason why you - our backers - can rest assured that we are capable of delivering ROXs to you. 
Check out the following two companies:
http://www.design2gather.comhttp://www.sky-worldwide.com
A-Champs - the brand behind ROXs - is a spin-off of both of those organizations.  
Development status
  Based on our production background we have integrated the manufacturing perspective right from the very beginning of the development process. 
Whatever we came up with during our concept phase was firstly validated for producibility and for compliance to safety, stability, testing, cost and usability requirements. 

This process is painful and takes time, but it eliminates the risk of developing something that finally can't be brought to market. 
We spent the last 2 years plus all our savings to bring ROXs to life. Now, the development is finished, molds, hard- and software are ready and the manufacturer - with whom we already work since many years - is only waiting to get the go-ahead to start producing.

More bang for the buck: here are our stretch goals
 Our perks
Our mission is to #GetKidsMoving and by doing so helping them to set the foundation for an active and healthy lifestyle. 
Based on the feedback that we received so far from kids, parents, teachers and industry professionals we are positive that ROXs will be a great success. So right from the beginning of this venture we want to share part of our success with kids in need. For every 30 ROXs BOXes ordered we will donate 1 set of ROXs to a charitable institution. We are currently still looking for cooperation partners, if you know a non-profit organization that cares about kids in need please contact us.

Anything helps to get the momentum going and is appreciated. Even if it is only a post on social media or letting your neighbor know about ROXs while grocery shopping. Your voice counts and will help us to on our mission to #GetKidsMoving. Thank you very much.
 
The Story behind ROXs

In 2008 Kilian and his wife Anika (both German) moved to China to start up a manufacturing and product development company. While the business quickly picked up Anika fell ill with breast cancer in 2008.
After a year of hardship and turmoil, the cancer fortunately went into remission. Sadly, according to doctor’s evaluation, the couple’s three planned children, “Rocco”, “Fritz” & “Bo” won’t be possible due to Anika’s heavy exposure to chemotherapy treatment.
The positive thing of the story is a newly heightened awareness about the need to live a healthy lifestyle.
Around the same time Kilian received a customer inquiry for a foam dumbbell set for kids, to emphasize the importance of working out at a young age. “What a terrible idea” he thought to himself, but his interest was sparked.
What other kinds of “kids fitness” products exist on the market? He searched, but he was unable to find any viable solutions that really engages children into being active. His excitement rose as he dived deeper into the topic to find that there was an opportunity to combine his existing business with his concern for a healthy lifestyle.  
Pretty soon the vision was clear: to finally bring to the market a solution to get kids moving. The idea for A-Champs - a global brand that helps kids to set the foundations for an active and thus healthy lifestyle - was born.
A crucial element of the A-Champs vision is to integrate a social component to the company by supporting a relevant non-profit organization. By doing so Kilian wants to thank the world for the most blessed gift it could have given him: his lovely, healthy wife gave birth to two beautiful baby girls named Polly & Pippa.
 
Risks & Challenges
Development & Manufacturing: Developing and manufacturing products is our daily business since 8 years. Our development team is located in Shanghai, China, in the heart of the world's factory. 
Our team is producing for the biggest global retailers since years and is able to perform according to strict quality, delivery time and social compliance requirements. The development of ROXs is done hand in hand with the manufacturer. Surprises relating to a gap between development expectations and producability realities - one of the major reasons why other hardware projects fail - can be eliminated. 
Reliability issues and challenges due to ""cultural differences"" between Western and Chinese ways of doing business can be avoided due to the fact that we already work with our manufacturing partners for several years. Plus we've all had our fair share of learning experiences (grey hair included) in the earlier years of our ventures manufacturing in China.  
Shipment and Fullfillment: Here we are working together with well established international freight forwarders as well as local order fullfillment houses that understand to ""drop ship"" product directly to the end consumer. We leave this part to the logistics pros.   
Marketing: This is our weak point. So far we have been focusing on the development of the product rather than talking about it. And that's exactly why we are here: Please help us to reach out to as  as many people as possible and let them know about ROXs and our mission to #GetKidsMoving.

When / where can I buy ROXs?
ROXs is available for purchase via our Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign starting June 13th, 2016.
 
Is ROXs only for kids? And how many players can play?
ROXs was created for kids ages six and up. But we found that it is a game for the complete family. Kids of all ages as well as grown-ups like the run, jump and play action. ROXs can support up to 50 individual players. You can either play by yourself, 1:1 against your friends or in a group. We have group play classics like Capture the ROXs and Zombie tag. And even the tap & go games can be played in a group. There are no limits, your imagination rules.
Can ROXs be customized?
One of the cool things about ROXs is that you can customize the game-play according to your rules. For example by increasing the distance between ROXs 2 players with different fitness levels can compete against each other. In this way both players can go to their maximum. There is no need for running half-throttle. ROXs can be placed anywhere within a 3,000sqft area and with the straps and holsters that come with ROXs they can be fixed to almost anything. Up to 50 ROXs can be added to the main game console for endless options.
Where can ROXs be played?
ROXs can be play indoors and outdoors, day and night, all year round. Any time, any place.
What are ROXs made of?
ROXs are made of ultra strong, safe materials. The ROXs top is made of the same material as jet fighter canopies (PC), the body is made of an ultra-strong plastic (ABS mixed with PC). The holsters are made out of silicone. All materials are virgin (=not recycled), which means they are safe and comply with strictest chemical standards.
How strong are ROXs?
ROXs are made to last. We know that kids will play rough with ROXs, so we made them extra strong. When constructing the shape, stability considerations were key. Kids can step on ROXs and ROXs can be hit with different kinds of balls. The material selection supports our stability and quality focus. Only super strong (and safe) materials are used.
Can more ROXs be added to a controller? 
Sure. Up to 30 ROXs can be added to one control unit.
Are ROXs waterproof?
No, they are not waterproof. The construction is designed to protect the interior from rain and dirt. The electronics inside are especially coated to be corrosion and water repellent. So if you leave them out for a night - ROXs will be fine. But do not throw them into the swimming pool.
What is the play range?
For most of the games you can place ROXs up to 40 feet apart from the controller. That means if you are playing with the ROXs BOX set (3ROXs) you can have a game area of around 3,000sqft (40ft x 80ft if you place them in a triangle shape with the master between 2 ROXs). For some games like Zombie tag and other tag games there are no range limitations. You can play from Alaska to Key West (better bring some healthy snacks).
How do I turn on ROXs? 
Turn on the controller by pressing the middle button and wait until all ROXs blink in blue color. Then tap those ROXs that you want to use for the game. After you tapped them, they will turn green, indicating that the controller “registered” them. If a ROXs does not turn green when tapping it means that this ROXs is out of reach of the controller. You then have to place this ROXs closer to the controller.
Can there be more games?
Yes, the software that powers ROXs is dynamic, so it can be upgrade at any time. This also refers to games, new games can be downloaded via www.playroxs.com once the website platform is completed. 
Can I adjust the volume?
Of course. There are 15 different sound volumes available.
Can I adjust the lights?
No, the light configuration is currently fixed to the relevant games.
How do they communicate?
ROXs communicate via RF (Radio Frequency).
What can they detect?
There are different smart sensors inside ROXs. They can detect motion, vibration, rotation and tapping. 
What languages?
Currently the language on ROXs is English, but we are already working on 6 other languages.
Do ROXs work with an App?
No, ROXs is designed to work without the help of any smartphones, tablets or other screens. We want kids to get away from screens for some time.
How are ROXs powered? Do they run on batteries?
Yes. Each ROXs as well as the master controller run on 3 x AA batteries. The batteries are not included in the initial set.
Can I use rechargeable batteries?
Of course. We even integrated a recharging module in ROXs, so if you use rechargeable batteries you do not need to take the batteries out when they need to be charged. Just use an USB cable to connect to a power source and the charging can happen.
How long do the batteries last?
You can play around 12 hours with one set of batteries.
Do I need more ROXs if we are more players? 
No. Most of the games can be played perfectly with the initial amount of 3 ROXs (or 5 ROXs for the ROXs Super BOX). For the tag games you can add more ROXs if you want to play with more than 3 players (5 for the ROXs Super BOX). In total you can add up to 30 ROXs to a controller.
How many colors are available?
Currently ROXs come in 1 color. The selection of the color is based on the feedback of more than 300 children, boys as well as girls. During our Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign we will also offer a limited edition in pure black. Depending on the demand we will be able to offer additional colors soon.
What's up with the chicken?
The chicken is not your average chicken. It is the crazy chicken, the main character of our signature game “Crazy Chicken”. It used to work in an office but got bored staring at a screen all day long. Now it is with us and makes kids RUN, JUMP and PLAY like crazy.
If I have 2 sets, can I combine all the ROXs? 
Yes, you can combine all the ROXs from up to 10 ROXs BOXes and integrate them into one big set. 1 controller will then control them. It is not possible (and not useful) to combine different controllers.  
What if both of my kids have a set of ROXs and they want to play simultaneously? Will the sets interfere with each other? 
No problem. When setting up a set of ROXs you “register” which ROXs should play with which controller. Once this is done the controller will know which ROXs should join the game and which ones should not.",33.0,1,"1 Campaign

<li>""I love how comfortable it is!! And it's perfect for beach weather and traveling!!""</li>
<li>""I work out regularly, whether it's swim, bike, or run. And I sweat a lot. Therefore, I like to be able to get out of my sweaty clothes before driving home. I also like to change out of my team kit after a triathlon. It is nice to be in dry clothing while hanging out with friends after a race...well, once we get to race again!""</li>
<li>""The undress - all versions I currently still own (SIL's, sister, and girlfriends keep complimenting them and they find their way to their closets :D) are my go-to uniform for travelling in, work, and hiking/sports to change into and out of when finished with my activity. International travel (when that last happened in the summertime) saw all of my wardrobe fit into my carryon backpack due to the undress and the scarves I also bought from Undress.

We are so thankful for our incredible community of women and men who have been by our side through all the ups and downs in this crazy adventure. If you have supported us in the past in any way, or have supported us now, thank you so much from the bottom of our hearts. We would not exist as a company AT ALL without you! Thank you for helping us make our dreams into reality!</p><p>We really hope you love The Undress Version 5! We feel this is the most elegant and graceful version of The Undress that we have ever made and we absolutely love it! We’re also excited about all the new features (especially the adjustable length!) and the fact that we will finally be making custom fabrics for the first time, which is a big dream come true for us. A huge thank you to all our previous backers for helping us create this new version with us! That’s why we love crowdfunding—it’s a platform that allows this kind of unique, personal connection between us and our amazing backers. That’s why we continue to come back again &amp; again and also encourage others to use it as a way to launch their own dreams and ideas.</p><p>If you choose to back our campaign today, you’ll help our little company make big changes like expand our distribution &amp; wholesale programs, develop new sales channels and continue to grow our brand on the global scale.

THANK YOU! </p></div>","The Undress is NOT a regular dress.  It has over 10 proprietary and patented features that make it function like no other dress in the world.If you workout, then you know the PAIN OF CHANGING OUTFITS OUTDOORS!We wanted to create a product that would empower women to be active, and support their active lifestyles. Woman regularly change clothes in the wildest of places - fighting sports bras, sticky leggings, and wet shirts - forcing millions of us to change in cars, nasty restrooms, and towel changing in public, just so we can enjoy the activities we love. This is a real problem MILLIONS of women share!With its patented features, you can change into, or out of in as little as 30 seconds. No privacy needed - and it even works to remove sports bras.
 HOW TO UNDRESSHow it works is simple - You can quickly change INTO OR OUT OF ANY OUTFIT, USING THE UNDRESS.

 How to Remove Your Top: First, bring The Undress to your waist. Then use the soft handle to guide the front of the dress underneath anything you want to remove. Bring the straps over your head, and cinch both the neck and back cord locks to secure. Finally, simply remove your top and bra. 

 How to Remove Your Bottoms: Insert your hands into the side access openings to easily remove your bottoms. 
You're now in the dress!

HOW TO RE-DRESS
Change into another outfit, such as your running clothes, by reversing the process.

 Put on your clothes over the Undress: Put your bra and top over The Undress, and use the special side openings to put on your bottoms. 

 Slip Out: Next, simply loosen the cord locks and use the soft handle to guide the straps under all your top layers.  Then just slip out of The Undress, and you’ll be in your new outfit!
DONE!
 
 

 TRAVEL - Travel dress, especially in hostels - you can even change in trains and planes. Wear it multiple ways for any destination!
 STUDIO - In a studio, when there are no changing rooms or bathroom lines are too long.
 WATER - The Undress is perfect for beach and swim sports. Do deck changes securely or change right on the beach without ever leaving your spot.

 MUD RUNS & OBSTACLE RACES - After Mud runs, when you don’t want to change in your car.

OUTDOORS - Light enough to take hiking and camping. Especially helpful if you’re sharing a tent!

TEAM SPORTS - For Sports Teams - both on and off the field, especially if you're surrounded by spectators. Show up in The Undress and change on the spot if needed!

LOCKER ROOMS + YOUTH - It’s perfect for students who must change in school locker rooms.

PHOTOGRAPHERS AND VIDEO - Models & Actresses can change anywhere during shoots, saving valuable time!

EVERYDAY WEAR - EVERYDAY WEAR - It’s beautiful and comfortable so you will want to wear it like your other favorite dress!
REAL TESTIMONIALS:
""I love how easy it is to use this dress to change after a race!""
""I am a surfer and I can change quickly at the beach without having to try and hide behind a towel or sit in my car. I love how easy it is to use.""
""I love how comfortable it is!! And it's perfect for beach weather and traveling!!""
""I work out regularly, whether it's swim, bike, or run. And I sweat a lot. Therefore, I like to be able to get out of my sweaty clothes before driving home. I also like to change out of my team kit after a triathlon. It is nice to be in dry clothing while hanging out with friends after a race...well, once we get to race again!""
""The undress - all versions I currently still own (SIL's, sister, and girlfriends keep complimenting them and they find their way to their closets :D) are my go-to uniform for travelling in, work, and hiking/sports to change into and out of when finished with my activity. International travel (when that last happened in the summertime) saw all of my wardrobe fit into my carryon backpack due to the undress and the scarves I also bought from Undress. And honestly, the zip hoodie, undercover, and t-shirts finished off my all my packing needs.""
""I kayak, canyoneer, climb, hike, etc and after a long hot day I usually end up just staying in the dress after changing. It's comfortable and cute!""
  Custom Designs - For the first time ever, we will design our own Prints! These prints are going to be customized, and will be inspired by the prototypes you see above.  We'er going to take what you see to the next level! CURRENT TOP COLORS BASED ON BACKER VOTES:
Black
Forest Blue
Santini Skies
Kat Nip Navy
Hi Hi Hibiscus
Hello Hawaii
La La Rhianna
Kuu Bluu
Kolors Like Kiara
Sydney Starlight
Sizing is simple since it is multi-adjustable for that perfect custom fit. With the new Button + Elastic System. Set it once, and forget it.
SIZING - The dress is SO adjustable (neck, back, length) we only need 3 sizes!  70% of our customers fit in ""Size B"".   If you are less that 5 feet tall, and of average weight, Size A is your best bet.The length has 10 inches of adjustment!Your color, size, and shipping address will be requested AFTER the campaign is over and is successful (after Dec 15).If you don’t love The Undress, please let us know - we will take care of you!We take our customer service seriously, and want to make sure you are happy.  

 Yes, this dress even LOOKS different!  (Dare we say better?!(  This dress is more modern, and is arguably the prettiest dress of all versions! 
Yes, you read that right. The most versatile dress in the world, just got more versatile!  Simply pull on the side straps and tie it up to the perfect length. Great for beaches, sand, or just kickin’ it at home.At full length, the dress is approximately 49 inches from the ""plunge"" of the neckline on the current prototype (keep in mind it may change slightly in actual production, but is should be close)When shortened, it can get as short as 39 inches from the ""plunge"", giving the dress 10 inches of adjustment!Due to popular demand, we brought back the lay-flat pockets with zippers, that have larger pocket capacity! Placement is higher up on the dress for better accessibility!
 NEW! You can now wear The Undress with a new nifty Double Strap feature (not just a halter!)  Wow, even more versatility!
 We have brand new fabric which is lightweight, breathable and comfortable.  For the first time ever, we are producing our OWN fabric designs (based closely on what is shown) to improve fabric availability.  When you pre-order, you also VOTE for the top designs that we will make.  If we get enough pre-orders, we will make ALL the styles available!
 We will be using the SAME factory that was used for The Undercover V2 that was DELIVERED 1 MONTH EARLY for Backers.  This is the BEST factory we have ever used, and we are confident that this factory will deliver the Undress V5, with quality and on time.
 It’s a matching, lightweight belt that you can attach to the dress (so you don’t lose it) or keep it separate!  Wear it to the front, or tie it in the back for a different look.  Also, with the back-center rear loop, you can attach the belt so you don’t lose it!
 It’s even easier to self-pack The Undress V5!  
 We created a versatile Undress Headband x Mask as a convenient and functional way to add some style to your outfit!  Made with the same fabric as the dress, you can wear it in multiple ways, and even as a small neck scarf!There is also a small pocket to insert a small mask filter, if you want!*Non-Medical.  Prototype shown, and subject to change
 It’s a matching, lightweight belt that you can attach to the dress (so you don’t lose it) or keep it separate!  Use the 3 belt loops in multiple ways to get different styles - fitted, belted, and gathered.Although The Undress Version 5 is not yet in production, we are here on Indiegogo so YOU can help make it a reality.Our team and factories are ready, and now all we need is you to make this real.

This sensitivity is due to the photoreceptor-proteins in the brain, which are similar to those found in the eyes, a discovery that had been made by researchers in the U.K. and the U.S. 10 years earlier.</p><p>University of Oulu researchers found that brain areas can be reached by light through ear canals, ear tissues and bones of skull. The skull of large mammals, including humans, lets light pass through naturally.

This sensitivity is due to the photoreceptor-proteins in the brain, which are similar to those found in the eyes, a discovery that had been made by researchers in the U.K. and the U.S. 10 years earlier.University of Oulu researchers found that brain areas can be reached by light through ear canals, ear tissues and bones of skull. The skull of large mammals, including humans, lets light pass through naturally. In normal daylight and daytime conditions the brain is constantly being exposed to light.Here are links to relevant published, peer-reviewed findings and doctoral dissertations:

<p>Chlorination is one of many methods that can be used to disinfect water. This method was first used over a century ago, and is still used today. It is a chemical disinfection method that uses various types of chlorine or chlorine-containing substances for the oxidation and disinfection of what will be the potable water source. Ita.fra’s Charbone filter will <strong>filter out Chlorine</strong>, which makes the <strong>water taste better</strong> and it <strong>takes away the odor of the water</strong> as well. But when the chlorine is filtered out, microorganism and bacteria will come back again, so that’s why you need <strong>UV disinfection</strong> as the last defence against microorganism and bacteria.</p>

<p>Unlike chemical approaches to water disinfection, UV provides <strong>rapid</strong>, <strong>effective </strong>inactivation of microorganisms through a physical process. When bacteria, viruses, and protozoa are exposed to the germicidal wavelengths of UV light, they are rendered incapable of reproducing and infecting. The UV light has demonstrated efficacy against pathogenic organisms, including those responsible for cholera, polio, typhoid, hepatitis, and other bacterial, viral, and parasitic diseases. In addition, UV light (either alone or in conjunction with hydrogen peroxide) can destroy chemical contaminants such as pesticides, industrial solvents, and pharmaceuticals through a process called UV-oxidation.</p>

What this poor child of God is looking at is a horror that most of the people on this earth must face over and over again throughout their lives!
My name is David Patrick Wilson.  My pure intention is to eradicate HSV 1&2 (aka 'Herpes') from the planet, RIGHT NOW! 
You can help!
 
We are very close to stopping one of the most prevalent and damaging epidemics plaguing the world today, of which too few are willing to even speak, namely the 'herpes simplex virus' or HSV.  The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that between 65-90% of the people of earth are suffering from some form of this virus. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, GA puts US estimates even higher. If you ever had chicken pox, kissed someone with HSV or had sexual contact with anyone who has it, you are a prime candidate for a potential 'outbreak!' It's  time for the People to take things into our own hands and put an end to the cause of this pain and suffering, simply because we can!
 
We call our project, ""Herpeze: The Solution."" It truly is and we are certain that it will work after hundreds of applications on human subjects that have produced near perfect results since very early in our process. We have not sought FDA approvals, nor will we. We don't require it. Besides, the truth is they are owned by 'Big Pharma!'  (They are making incredible money off of the misery of this, up to now, 'incurable' affliction!) The fact is, it is high time for them to step aside.
We, the People, can get it done! We are in need of these funds to secure basic commercial protections (trademarks, copyrights, patents, etc.), purchase ingredients, buy equipment, set up 'clean rooms' and produce, market and distribute, 'The Solution Kit' throughout the planet. This modest campaign will launch us. The funds obtained here will also be used to hire US workers, acquire the components locally, assemble, pack and ship 'The Solution Kit' to the four corners of the earth. 
 

 There are an estimated SIX (6) BILLION potential users, eagerly, anxiously, painfully awaiting us to start shipping 'The Solution.'. Help us get them relief! 
The time is NOW! Everything is ready, tried and tested. It's safe. No harmful drugs! No toxic soup! No hazardous waste! 'The Solution' is all natural, inexpensive and easy to use. It does not require weeks or months of a daily regimen of ingesting minerals, potions, pills and prescriptions. There are no books you have to read with incantations or rituals you need to practice to be relieved of the problem. There is a simple 'kit' with a written guarantee, four (4) tablets, two (2) glass jars, four (4) applicators and a single page of instructions. The rest you supply in your own home! 'The Solution' is your solution!!! 
JUST THINK OF IT! NOW YOU CAN REJOICE! The only thing you have to fear is freedom from this evil epidemic. All you have to lose are the 'zosters' and the 'pox' on you, your family and friends. We know that you or someone you know is a victim of this blight. Don't you want to get this struggle over with and move on to a better life?
If the answer is 'yes', please join us and let's make 2014, ""FREE of HSV!'

<h2>Ready Prevent</h2>
<p>This year in the US there will be 1,660,290 people diagnosed with cancer. Of those diagnosed, 580,350 will die.  The most prevalent cancers are lung, breast, prostate, and colon cancer.  228,190 people will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year.  Survival rate varys with staging.  Stage 1A and 1B see a survival rate of 47%.  At stage 2A and 2B the survival rate drops to 30%.  At stage 3A and 3B the average drops to 9%.  Stage 4  survival rate is less than 1%.  Early detection is key in the fight against cancer.  Unfortunately, there has never been a cost efficient or convenient way to test for cancer until now.  Ready Prevent is a medical diagnostics tool that functions much like a blood glucose meter.  From a small blood sample, this tool can give the user an accurate reading of the amount of the body’s natural cancer fighting cell, or lack thereof.  The blood test strips used in the tool are impregnated with a specially engineered antibody targeted towards cancer fighting cells.  Once the blood sample has been applied to the strip, the antibodies attach to all the cancer fighting cells, and are then carried down the strip.  At the end of the strip is a dye that changes in color depending on how many antibodies have attached to cancer fighting cells.  The device, using proven, photometric technology, obtains a reading from the color change which is proportionate to the amount of cancer fighting cells in the blood.</p>
<p>In 2002, the average cost to treat lung cancer was $39,891 a year.  The average cost to treat breast cancer was $20,964 a year.  In 2002, the United States, as a whole, spent $6.7 billion on cancer care.  As you can imagine, the prices since 2002 have risen substantially.  Today, there are thousands of people that cannot afford the rising costs associated with oncology care, and some that can’t even afford the price of normally scheduled checkups.  With Ready Prevent, anyone and everyone will have the ability to check themselves.  Ready Prevent is affordable, and efficient.  The average user will only need to test once a month, while other high risk users, such as smokers, are encouraged to test 2-3 times a month (for research purposes).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Can Ready Prevent predict or diagnose cancer?</h2>
<p>No.  Ready Prevent cannot predict or diagnose cancer.  What it can do, is let the user know when their body is in a disease state.  This means the user will know when he or she is at the highest risk for tumor development.  Knowing this information is invaluable.  It will let users know when they should take steps to bring their body out of a disease state and seek further medical attention.  Knowing this information could ultimately be the difference between life and death.</p>
<h2>What is the impact of Ready Prevent?</h2>
<p>The information that Ready Prevent could provide is priceless.  If monitored appropriately and reported, this could give researchers invaluable clues such as: Why these cancer fighting cells become scarce, ways to improve the number of these cells, and how these cells react to certain diets or exercise.</p>
<h2>Why we need funding</h2>
<p>We are asking for funding in order to further develop our antibody.  Currently we are working with polyclonal antibodies.  Polyclonal antibodies are much more cost efficient in the testing phases.  The drawback to these polyclonal antibodies is, they take much more time and are less efficient to actually harvest.  We are wanting to make a monoclonal antibody so that we can start reproducing our antibody on a mass scale.  This monoclonal antibody will make the testing process much faster, and will cut cost for the consumer.</p>
<h2>What you get from funding</h2>
<p>By funding this campaign, you will help see that the consumer product is made more efficiently, gets readings more accurately, and costs much less than could have been achieved without funding.</p>
<h2>Live Q and A sessions during the campaign!</h2>
<p>Please stay posted for updates on our website, we will be holding live question and answer sessions at least 4 times during the course of this campaign. This will help us determine what questions people have and be able to provide you with the information you need to feel confident when contributing to our campaign.</p>
<h2>Spread the word!</h2>
<p>Please share our campaign and help us reach our goal.  Not only will you be helping this campaign, but you will be contributing to cancer prevention worldwide.</p>
<h2>Referal contest!</h2>
<p>The top 5 funders with the most referals will all win our Researchers perk package.  The contest starts the day of launch and ends on the last day of the campaign.</p>

Through the use of specialized software and an infrared camera, a parent or caregiver is alerted on their IOS device to unusual movement in the monitored location. Events are recorded and archived for further use.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>I can't afford SAMi.</strong><br/>If your need is immediate and you need assistance purchasing SAMi, visit our resources page at <a href=""http://www.samialert.com/resources"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.samialert.com/resources</a> for a list of organizations we work with, many of which will be receiving cameras from this campaign. </p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Is SAMi a medical device?  Can I get insurance to pay for SAMi?</strong></p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">SAMi is not a medical device.  You should check with your insurance provider for assistance in purchasing. </p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">""SAMi is a nocturnal movement monitor and will detect all types of movement regardless of the movement’s origin.  HiPass Design LLC. does not guarantee the effectiveness of SAMi for any particular application and use of SAMi is solely at your own risk.  SAMi has not been evaluated or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other government agency for any purpose.  SAMi is not a medical device and is not intended for use in the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, or cure of any disease or other conditions.  Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. ""</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Can I turn the motion monitoring on and off with an automated schedule?</strong><br/>Yes.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>How do I turn the alarm off temporarily?</strong><br/>You may touch the alarm indicator in the upper right corner of the live view screen. It will turn back on automatically if the scheduler is set up.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>How long can you run SAMi on your IOS device using battery?</strong><br/>We see run times of roughly 4 hours on a full charge. SAMi can be configured to alert you when the battery is running low.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>What is the lock function for?</strong><br/>The lock function dims the screen and secures the SAMi buttons in their current state. This reduces the chance of changing settings in SAMi while handling the IOS device or carrying it in your pocket. While locked the app is still monitoring and will vibrate in addition to playing an alarm sound when triggered</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>What do you recommend for Wi-Fi?</strong><br/>Wi-Fi performance is important so we recommend using a high quality router. The camera supports IEEE802.11b/g. Most IOS devices now support 5 GHz Wi-Fi and we strongly recommend you use an router that supports this as well. All Apple brand routers work well.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Can I take this with me when we travel?</strong><br/>Yes, but you will normally need to bring a Wi-Fi router as well as the SAMi camera.  Usually it is not possible to connect your camera to a hotel's Wi-Fi. The complete kit includes the Wi-Fi router and is easily relocated.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>What is the log?</strong><br/>SAMi records a log that includes information about usage. This does not include video or audio, it simply logs technical information about the motion detection and faults. If you have technical problems we may request that you send us this log.  You can clear the log from the help page.  Note that clearing the log does not delete any of your recordings.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>What format are the recordings?</strong><br/>The files are recorded in MP4 format; most modern computers can play them.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>How do I save recordings on my computer or email them?</strong><br/>You can get the recordings off the device by following these steps.</p><ol style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">
<li>Connect the IOS device to iTunes.</li>
<li>Select the device as if you were going to sync it under devices on the left.</li>
<li>Select Apps at the top.</li>
<li>Scroll down to “file sharing” which is below the list of apps.</li>
<li>Select SAMi under file sharing (you may need to scroll through the apps).</li>
<li>You will see the list of recordings on the right. The file names include the date and time the recording was made in the form: Year-Month-Day_Hour-Minute-second_Duration. Recordings that end in “_A” were made when the alarm sounded.  Note that the displayed time next to the name will be different and is less accurate. You can either drag the recording to where you want it to go, or choose “save to…”.</li>
</ol><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Can I use this to record myself?</strong><br/>Yes. With the alarm muted you can record your sleep for review the next day. These recorded videos may also be useful for purposes of medical consultation. In addition, with the alarm on  SAMi can alert you after unusual activity so you can take action if necessary (for example take medication).</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Can I use this during the day?</strong><br/>Yes, however all movement is being analyzed, making the possibility of “false positives” much more likely.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>What is the difference between motion threshold and alarm threshold?</strong><br/>The motion threshold determines how much motion is significant. The alarm threshold sets the amount of time for significant motion before the alert is activated. These come with a default setting that can be adjusted.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>How should I adjust the motion and alarm thresholds?</strong></p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The best way to set the thresholds is through a bit of simulation.  You might want to position yourself in the bed with the iPod and watch yourself. Stay very still, then simulate the motion.  You will see the green meter move with the motion. There is a pointer to the side of the meter that indicates the setting of the motion threshold. When you are still, the green meter should be below this. When you simulate the motion, it should be above the pointer. If not, move the motion threshold lower. Best is to do this with the same amount of light as there will be in the room at night. To set the alarm threshold, choose how long the motion needs to continue before the alarm sounds. We found 20 seconds was a good tradeoff between false alarms and missing events.  If you set it shorter, expect more false alarms.  Note that these controls do not affect recordings. Recordings are made whenever there is motion, even slight short motion.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Can I trigger an alarm from just sound?</strong><br/>No, the alarm is based on motion. Audio alarm features are planned.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Does the app work in the background?</strong><br/>No. However, the camera will continue to make recordings and these will transfer to your IOS device once you start SAMi again.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>How do I set the clock?</strong><br/>SAMi uses the IOS device clock. Set it through “IOS settings/General/Date &amp; Time”.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>What does the motion button do?</strong><br/>When the motion button is pressed the live display highlights motion in red and shows the selected border in green. This is useful for testing the sensitivity of the motion detection and for sizing the border and positioning the camera.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>What if I receive a text message or call while I am using the app?</strong><br/>The SAMi application will be suspended while you answer a call. At the end of a call, SAMi will resume. Notifications appear briefly, and will will not interrupt SAMi unless you leave the application to read  or respond to a text message. Note that the camera will continue to make recordings even when the SAMi app is not running. These will transfer to your IOS device once you start SAMi again.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>How much time can I record?</strong><br/>Recordings consume 1-4MB of flash memory per minute depending on the amount of motion. On an active night you may see as much as 30 minutes of recordings. With a dedicated 8GB iPod you should be able to keep close to a month’s worth of activity before you would need to start deleting recordings. Note that you can always transfer your recordings to a computer for permanent storage.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>How is this different from a baby monitor?</strong><br/>SAMi uses proprietary algorithms to filter out the usual motion and noise that would be reported through a conventional monitor. Fine tuning of the alarm sensitivity will greatly reduce and perhaps eliminate false alerts without compromising the goal of zero missed important movement events. Fewer false alarms equals better sleep!  Sami also has a selective recording capability not found in baby monitors.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Is Wi-Fi required?</strong><br/>The IOS device requires WI-FI but the camera may use either WI-FI or wired Ethernet.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Can I use my own network camera?</strong><br/>No. The SAMi application has been optimized for use with the SAMi camera.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>How far away from the camera can my IOS device be?</strong><br/>This is limited only by your WI-FI connection. The typical range using a single Wi-Fi router is around 50 feet (15 meters) indoors. More routers will increase the range. There are also inexpensive Wi-Fi range extenders.  </p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Do I have to be connected to the internet?</strong><br/>No, unless you want to send us diagnostic information. For this feature you will need to be connected to the internet and you will have to set up an email account on your IOS device.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>What is the alarm sound?</strong></p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><a href=""http://www.policeinterceptor.com/sounds/genalrm.wav"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://static.squarespace.com/static/52cf00ede4b029f494ac9381/t/52d30c2ae4b06d9fa03926ab/1389562922828/genalrm.mp3/original/genalrm.mp3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Navy Surface Ship General Alarm AN/SIA-114B</a></p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">We used a Navy Surface ship General Alarm sound, AN/SIA-114B to be precise.  Very effective!</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Can I monitor over the internet?</strong><br/>No. The application does not send images or messages across the internet.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Is there an Android version?</strong><br/>No. This may be considered for a future release.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Can I use the app without a network camera?</strong><br/>Yes, you may use the front or back camera on the IOS device but you will not be able to make recordings and the IOS cameras will not work in the dark. This is mostly useful for trying out the app and demonstrations.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Can I make recordings when I am not using the alarm?</strong><br/>Yes, recordings are made even when the alarm is disabled. However, if the alarm is enabled recordings that are made near when the alarm is triggered are marked in red. This helps identify the interesting recordings.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Does the movement have to be rhythmic?</strong><br/>No.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>How much movement is required to trigger an alarm or recording?</strong><br/>There is a control for setting the sensitivity of the alarm. It comes with a default setting, but can be adjusted to pick up movements as minor as foot or finger wags.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>What are the red lights on the front? Can I turn them off?</strong><br/>The lights are infrared illuminators. This enables a good quality image, even in complete darkness. You cannot turn them off.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Can SAMi detect seizures?</strong><br/>SAMi is a nocturnal movement monitor and not a medical device. It will detect all types of movement regardless of the movement’s origin.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>What are the benefits of SAMi?</strong><br/>SAMi offers you the security of having a system in place to dependably alert you only when necessary.  This system is configured to your situation, not a “one size fits all” product.  It provides high quality, accurate recordings that are time/date/duration stamped for purpose of documentation, review/evaluation, and communication with your specialist.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>What do I need to make SAMi work?</strong><br/>You will need to have an <a href=""http://www.samialert.com/devices"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iPhone or iPod (IOS device)</a>.<br/>You will need the free SAMi application from the iTunes store.<br/>You will need the SAMi infrared camera.<br/>You will need WI-FI.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>What do I need to run SAMi?</strong><br/>The latest list of supported models is <a href=""http://www.samialert.com/devices"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p><p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong>Is there a recommended IOS device?</strong><br/>All the supported devices work well. However, we have found it is really nice if you can dedicate a device to be a monitor. That way you can leave it always running.

We had no idea our son was having seizures at night until one time when we were traveling with him.  While sharing a hotel room we discovered that he was having seizures in his sleep. We needed to know more.  We needed to know when he needed us.We made the first version of our movement detector in 2009. The prototype used an existing network security camera which ran on a dedicated laptop computer. Over the next few years we increased the reliability by calibrating the movement detection algorithm. Charles and I quickly became dependent on the prototype; over time we reduced the false ""positives"" and eliminated the false ""negatives.""  Finally, a decent night's sleep!  We knew that we would be alerted when our son needed us.We realized that this system would also be helpful to others, but dedicating a computer is not practical for most people.  In early 2011 we focused our efforts on building a second generation iOS-based camera which became SAMi. Later that year the Epilepsy Therapy Project announced their first annual Shark Tank Competition. The Epilepsy Therapy Project (now a part of the Epilepsy Foundation) is a non-profit organization whose mission is to improve the lives of people living with recurring seizures. We entered the competition and in February 2012 presented our invention to the judges and an appreciative audience. SAMi was awarded first prizeWe quickly put the prize money to good use to accelerate the development and production of the SAMi 2 camera. Within six months we produced the first SAMi 2 units for our 10 beta customers.  We now have customers throughout the U.S., Canada and Australia and are looking forward to growing our business and reaching people throughout the world.

What is SAMi?SAMi is an intelligent, configurable, video based nighttime movement detection system. Through the use of specialized software and an infrared camera, a parent or caregiver is alerted on their IOS device to unusual movement in the monitored location. Events are recorded and archived for further use.I can't afford SAMi.If your need is immediate and you need assistance purchasing SAMi, visit our resources page at www.samialert.com/resources for a list of organizations we work with, many of which will be receiving cameras from this campaign. Is SAMi a medical device?  Can I get insurance to pay for SAMi?SAMi is not a medical device.  You should check with your insurance provider for assistance in purchasing. ""SAMi is a nocturnal movement monitor and will detect all types of movement regardless of the movement’s origin.  HiPass Design LLC. does not guarantee the effectiveness of SAMi for any particular application and use of SAMi is solely at your own risk.  SAMi has not been evaluated or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or any other government agency for any purpose.  SAMi is not a medical device and is not intended for use in the prevention, diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, or cure of any disease or other conditions.  Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. ""Can I turn the motion monitoring on and off with an automated schedule?Yes.How do I turn the alarm off temporarily?You may touch the alarm indicator in the upper right corner of the live view screen. It will turn back on automatically if the scheduler is set up.How long can you run SAMi on your IOS device using battery?We see run times of roughly 4 hours on a full charge. SAMi can be configured to alert you when the battery is running low.What is the lock function for?The lock function dims the screen and secures the SAMi buttons in their current state. This reduces the chance of changing settings in SAMi while handling the IOS device or carrying it in your pocket. While locked the app is still monitoring and will vibrate in addition to playing an alarm sound when triggeredWhat do you recommend for Wi-Fi?Wi-Fi performance is important so we recommend using a high quality router. The camera supports IEEE802.11b/g. Most IOS devices now support 5 GHz Wi-Fi and we strongly recommend you use an router that supports this as well. All Apple brand routers work well.Can I take this with me when we travel?Yes, but you will normally need to bring a Wi-Fi router as well as the SAMi camera.  Usually it is not possible to connect your camera to a hotel's Wi-Fi. The complete kit includes the Wi-Fi router and is easily relocated.What is the log?SAMi records a log that includes information about usage. This does not include video or audio, it simply logs technical information about the motion detection and faults. If you have technical problems we may request that you send us this log.  You can clear the log from the help page.  Note that clearing the log does not delete any of your recordings.What format are the recordings?The files are recorded in MP4 format; most modern computers can play them.How do I save recordings on my computer or email them?You can get the recordings off the device by following these steps.
Connect the IOS device to iTunes.
Select the device as if you were going to sync it under devices on the left.
Select Apps at the top.
Scroll down to “file sharing” which is below the list of apps.
Select SAMi under file sharing (you may need to scroll through the apps).
You will see the list of recordings on the right. The file names include the date and time the recording was made in the form: Year-Month-Day_Hour-Minute-second_Duration. Recordings that end in “_A” were made when the alarm sounded.  Note that the displayed time next to the name will be different and is less accurate. You can either drag the recording to where you want it to go, or choose “save to…”.
Can I use this to record myself?Yes. With the alarm muted you can record your sleep for review the next day. These recorded videos may also be useful for purposes of medical consultation. In addition, with the alarm on  SAMi can alert you after unusual activity so you can take action if necessary (for example take medication).Can I use this during the day?Yes, however all movement is being analyzed, making the possibility of “false positives” much more likely.What is the difference between motion threshold and alarm threshold?The motion threshold determines how much motion is significant. The alarm threshold sets the amount of time for significant motion before the alert is activated. These come with a default setting that can be adjusted.How should I adjust the motion and alarm thresholds?The best way to set the thresholds is through a bit of simulation.  You might want to position yourself in the bed with the iPod and watch yourself. Stay very still, then simulate the motion.  You will see the green meter move with the motion. There is a pointer to the side of the meter that indicates the setting of the motion threshold. When you are still, the green meter should be below this. When you simulate the motion, it should be above the pointer. If not, move the motion threshold lower. Best is to do this with the same amount of light as there will be in the room at night. To set the alarm threshold, choose how long the motion needs to continue before the alarm sounds. We found 20 seconds was a good tradeoff between false alarms and missing events.  If you set it shorter, expect more false alarms.  Note that these controls do not affect recordings. Recordings are made whenever there is motion, even slight short motion.Can I trigger an alarm from just sound?No, the alarm is based on motion. Audio alarm features are planned.Does the app work in the background?No. However, the camera will continue to make recordings and these will transfer to your IOS device once you start SAMi again.How do I set the clock?SAMi uses the IOS device clock. Set it through “IOS settings/General/Date & Time”.What does the motion button do?When the motion button is pressed the live display highlights motion in red and shows the selected border in green. This is useful for testing the sensitivity of the motion detection and for sizing the border and positioning the camera.What if I receive a text message or call while I am using the app?The SAMi application will be suspended while you answer a call. At the end of a call, SAMi will resume. Notifications appear briefly, and will will not interrupt SAMi unless you leave the application to read  or respond to a text message. Note that the camera will continue to make recordings even when the SAMi app is not running. These will transfer to your IOS device once you start SAMi again.How much time can I record?Recordings consume 1-4MB of flash memory per minute depending on the amount of motion. On an active night you may see as much as 30 minutes of recordings. With a dedicated 8GB iPod you should be able to keep close to a month’s worth of activity before you would need to start deleting recordings. Note that you can always transfer your recordings to a computer for permanent storage.How is this different from a baby monitor?SAMi uses proprietary algorithms to filter out the usual motion and noise that would be reported through a conventional monitor. Fine tuning of the alarm sensitivity will greatly reduce and perhaps eliminate false alerts without compromising the goal of zero missed important movement events. Fewer false alarms equals better sleep!  Sami also has a selective recording capability not found in baby monitors.Is Wi-Fi required?The IOS device requires WI-FI but the camera may use either WI-FI or wired Ethernet.Can I use my own network camera?No. The SAMi application has been optimized for use with the SAMi camera.How far away from the camera can my IOS device be?This is limited only by your WI-FI connection. The typical range using a single Wi-Fi router is around 50 feet (15 meters) indoors. More routers will increase the range. There are also inexpensive Wi-Fi range extenders.  Do I have to be connected to the internet?No, unless you want to send us diagnostic information. For this feature you will need to be connected to the internet and you will have to set up an email account on your IOS device.What is the alarm sound?Navy Surface Ship General Alarm AN/SIA-114BWe used a Navy Surface ship General Alarm sound, AN/SIA-114B to be precise.  Very effective!Can I monitor over the internet?No. The application does not send images or messages across the internet.Is there an Android version?No. This may be considered for a future release.Can I use the app without a network camera?Yes, you may use the front or back camera on the IOS device but you will not be able to make recordings and the IOS cameras will not work in the dark. This is mostly useful for trying out the app and demonstrations.Can I make recordings when I am not using the alarm?Yes, recordings are made even when the alarm is disabled. However, if the alarm is enabled recordings that are made near when the alarm is triggered are marked in red. This helps identify the interesting recordings.Does the movement have to be rhythmic?No.How much movement is required to trigger an alarm or recording?There is a control for setting the sensitivity of the alarm. It comes with a default setting, but can be adjusted to pick up movements as minor as foot or finger wags.What are the red lights on the front? Can I turn them off?The lights are infrared illuminators. This enables a good quality image, even in complete darkness. You cannot turn them off.Can SAMi detect seizures?SAMi is a nocturnal movement monitor and not a medical device. It will detect all types of movement regardless of the movement’s origin.What are the benefits of SAMi?SAMi offers you the security of having a system in place to dependably alert you only when necessary.  This system is configured to your situation, not a “one size fits all” product.  It provides high quality, accurate recordings that are time/date/duration stamped for purpose of documentation, review/evaluation, and communication with your specialist.What do I need to make SAMi work?You will need to have an iPhone or iPod (IOS device).You will need the free SAMi application from the iTunes store.You will need the SAMi infrared camera.You will need WI-FI.What do I need to run SAMi?The latest list of supported models is here.Is there a recommended IOS device?All the supported devices work well. However, we have found it is really nice if you can dedicate a device to be a monitor. That way you can leave it always running. There is a scheduling feature that automatically turns the monitoring off during the day and back on at night at customized times set by the user.

Advancement Director for Starr King School for the Ministry, the seminary I am
honored to have graduated from last May. It is a joy to connect with donors and
others interested in supporting Starr King, and I look forward to
returning to parish ministry sometime in the next few years once Starr King is ready to find the long-term advancement
staff who will best carry them into their next chapter. I live in Oakland, CA
with my 2 cats.
About
the ordination:
The
ordination will take place at 4pm on February 28th, 2015 at All
Souls Church, Unitarian in Washington DC. Clergy, seminarians, and religious educators are invited to gather at 3:30pm to robe and process in the ceremony. A reception for all will follow. I’m honored to have many of my close
colleagues and mentors leading the service including the preacher Rev. Jay
Leach, senior minister at the Unitarian Universalist Church of Charlotte, NC;
Rev. Dr. Rob Hardies, senior minister of All Souls DC; Rev. Rosemary Bray
McNatt, president of Starr King School for the Ministery; and Rev. Dr. Rebecca
Parker, president and professor emeritus of Starr King. Together, we will
experience transcendent music from the All Souls choirs and celebrate this meaningful beginning. All are welcome,
and I hope to see you there!

of actual innocence. Courts are slow to accept the compelling evidence

<p>We
 are going on a special journey that we are inviting you to take with 
us. We have been invited to be of service to a Great Soul, Phakyab 
Rinpoche, a high ranking Tibetan Lama who was inprisoned and tortured by
 the Chinese. He ultimately escaped with life threatening injuries and 
healed these injuries using the teachings of the Medicine Buddha. 
Rinpoche has written a book that was released in France last month about
 his experiences and healing and has been widely received. His book will
 be translated and released in the US in 2015. Rinpoche has a 
significant global following of students and has been gifted a 
property in Normandy, France, that is a 50 minute train ride from 
Paris. With Rinpoche, we will be expanding the existing property into an
 international  retreat center for the Medicine Buddha teachings. </p> <p> </p>
<p>Our
 role is to be of service to Rinpoche by expanding, developing and 
designing this sacred place, Menla Thodol Ling, which is steeped in his 
presence and committed purpose. We will be working with an architect 
from San Francisco, Barbara Brown, who is a student of Phakyab Rinpoche 
and who designed the Northern California Tibetan Center. .Even more than
 the giving of our talents and international experience
 for this amazing project, we are seeking a deeper awakening of our own 
hearts as we are being guided to the Rinpoche's teachings for our 
healing. </p> <p> </p>
<p>This
 is truly a Journey of a Lifetime and we are asking you join us by 
directing your energy to the success of this endeavor. The idea of 
bringing you along came from a number of friends who saw this as an 
opportunity for our entire ""Tribal Family."" We are asking that you 
contribute financially as your affirmation of our journey as well as the
 journey of Menla Thodol Ling, as it is manifested in to <span>(into) a global center for those seeking greater enlightenment at these magnificent and yet challenging
 times.  We are seeking $5,000 for two coach airline tickets and minimal
 travel expenses and any amount above that will go the Menla's 
development, so we are trusting that our family and friends will be 
guided to an appropriate amount for such a donation. For those 
contributing, we will issue a monthly blog so you can follow both 
processes -- the awakening of Menla, the awakening of the Zimmers. Our 
goal is to travel to France in mid-January. We both feel that this 
center is truly a gift to the world and we feel so humbled to use all 
our years of design and development experience in manifesting this great

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>In 2002, while pregnant with our son, Colleen's left lower leg began to swell. The doctors that she went to first explained the swelling and enlargement as pregnancy swelling and would go away with the birth of our son.</p>
<p>Many doctors thought she had tumor or even a blocked vein that was causing the continuous swelling of the leg. Unhappy with the various opinions from other doctors we met with a Vascular Surgeon, who, after some research, finally diagnosed Colleen’s condition as Primary Lymphedema.</p>
<p>From that point on our lives were turned upside down as there very few treatment options available. What was made clear, was that unlike tumors which can be removed, or vein blockages that can be unblocked, there is no cure for Lymphedema.</p>
<p>There is however, only various types of treatment that focuses on reducing the swelling and controlling the pain. The most common type of treatments are manual lymph drainage (MLD) or complete decongestive therapy (CDT). Most of these treatments, if began at the very onset of the swelling, can help in the control and maintaining of lymphedema.</p>
<p>However, when the diagnosis goes on for so long that the affected limb cannot be treated, the lymphedema can become extreme. Once the lymphedema has achieved this state, it becomes quiet difficult, if not nearly impossible to control, let alone maintain.</p>
<p>The biggest issue facing Colleen living with lymphedema is not necessarily the lack of proper diagnosis, proper treatment, and proper therapy. It is the fact that insurance is unwilling or unable to address her long term needs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
We found a way for Colleen to take back her life from Lymhedema.  A Specialized Lymphatic surgery that will reduce her leg back to within 90% - 95% of its original size.  Insurance previously denied her this surgery as it was ""experimental and investigational"".  We are looking to work with the hospital to maybe get them to help out with lowering expenses and paying for the Dr.'s payment.  But we are still going to need a lot of money.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We need your help.  We are looking for 30,000 at least which is eay to do.  All we need is 300 people to donate $100, or 600 to donate $50.  This surgery will change Colleen's life forever.  She will always have to wear compression garments and always have to have massage therapy to maintain the size fo her leg, but at least she will no longer have to worry about people staring at her, bulling her or making her feel like is a circus side show.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Currently there is no cure for lymphedema there is only the control and maintainance of this condition, and without proper treatment such as Physical Therapies, Manual Lymph Drainage, the use of bandage wrappings and the wearing of custom made garments this condition will become life threatening from infections.  This surgery will change Colleen's life, our lives and the way she views herself. </p>

<h3><strong>UPDATE</strong></h3>
<p>Wenn wir bei Erreichen unseres Ziels idealerweise noch 3000€ von Google bekommen, gibt es ein Upgrade der ""1-Tages-Dreh""-Fotostory:</p>
<p>Eine ""3-Tages-Dreh""- VIDEOstory!</p>
<h3><strong>Unser Ziel</strong></h3>
<p>Wir sind ein angehendes Social Start-Up mit dem Ziel, das Mindset benachteiligter Jugendlicher zu ändern, um deren Bildungserfolg messbar zu erhöhen. Zusammen mit Medienschaffenden und Motivationspsychologen entwickeln wir innovative Medienformate für Jugendliche nach dem „Entertainment-Education“ Prinzip:</p>
<p>Mit einer unterhaltsamen Story erreichen wir die Jugendlichen, so dass Sie am Ende sagen: „Ich kann das auch schaffen"".</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Welches Problem lösen wir?</h3>
<p>Das Kernproblem benachteiligter Jugendlicher ist deren statische Einstellung (Fixed Mindset). Ein schwieriges familiäres und soziales Umfeld, das Fehlen positiver Vorbilder sowie die Vorurteile von Lehrern und Gesellschaft projizieren dieses statische Selbstbild auf die Jugendlichen. Symptomatisch dafür sind beispielsweise häufige Aussprüche wie „Ich bin nur ein dummer Hauptschüler“ oder „Ich kann das nicht“. Diese Einstellung hemmt massiv deren weitere Entwicklung und unterdrückt schon im Keim die Motivation. Die Folge sind niedriger Bildungserfolg - jedes Jahr beginnen ca. 150.000 Jugendliche ihr Erwerbsleben ohne Ausbildungsabschluss - und damit einhergehend eingeschränkte soziale Mobilität und die Verschwendung von Potenzial, das für Gesellschaft sowie Wirtschaft von großem Wert ist.</p>
<div class=""idea-content"">
<h3><strong>Der Lösungsansatz</strong></h3>
<p>Um den Bildungserfolg zielgruppenspezifisch und breitenwirksam zu erhöhen entwickeln wir Medienformate nach dem ""Entertainment-Education"" Prinzip.

Wenn wir bei Erreichen unseres Ziels idealerweise noch 3000€ von Google bekommen, gibt es ein Upgrade der ""1-Tages-Dreh""-Fotostory:
Eine ""3-Tages-Dreh""- VIDEOstory!
Unser Ziel
Wir sind ein angehendes Social Start-Up mit dem Ziel, das Mindset benachteiligter Jugendlicher zu ändern, um deren Bildungserfolg messbar zu erhöhen. Zusammen mit Medienschaffenden und Motivationspsychologen entwickeln wir innovative Medienformate für Jugendliche nach dem „Entertainment-Education“ Prinzip:
Mit einer unterhaltsamen Story erreichen wir die Jugendlichen, so dass Sie am Ende sagen: „Ich kann das auch schaffen"".


Welches Problem lösen wir?
Das Kernproblem benachteiligter Jugendlicher ist deren statische Einstellung (Fixed Mindset). Ein schwieriges familiäres und soziales Umfeld, das Fehlen positiver Vorbilder sowie die Vorurteile von Lehrern und Gesellschaft projizieren dieses statische Selbstbild auf die Jugendlichen. Symptomatisch dafür sind beispielsweise häufige Aussprüche wie „Ich bin nur ein dummer Hauptschüler“ oder „Ich kann das nicht“. Diese Einstellung hemmt massiv deren weitere Entwicklung und unterdrückt schon im Keim die Motivation. Die Folge sind niedriger Bildungserfolg - jedes Jahr beginnen ca. 150.000 Jugendliche ihr Erwerbsleben ohne Ausbildungsabschluss - und damit einhergehend eingeschränkte soziale Mobilität und die Verschwendung von Potenzial, das für Gesellschaft sowie Wirtschaft von großem Wert ist.

Der Lösungsansatz
Um den Bildungserfolg zielgruppenspezifisch und breitenwirksam zu erhöhen entwickeln wir Medienformate nach dem ""Entertainment-Education"" Prinzip. Bisher wird dieses Prinzip in Entwicklungsländern eingesetzt, um Menschen z.B. mit spannenden Telenovelas zu erreichen, zu berühren und mit einer durchdachten Story zur Änderung ihres  Verhaltens zu bewegen. Damit wird z.B. Analphabetismus oder AIDS bekämpft - mit großem sozialen aber auch kommerziellen Erfolg!

<h3>About Us and the Oil</h3>
<p>This summer, I was offered the chance to try a new olive oil and it had more flavor than I thought possible, having been used to ""supermarket"" olive oil. My wife and I decided to take the opportunity to bring this wonderful olive oil to share with you, and need some help funding the first shipment over from Spain. We feel that you can find any number of good Italian olive oils here, but it's rare to find premium Spanish oils, and think that you will love Cortijo el Puerto as much as we do.</p>
<p>Our Spanish partner has a young biodiverse farm designed to be in balance with the ecosystem, keeping the olive trees alongside many native plants and the animals that make their habitats there. There are over 12 varieties of olive trees, some of which are still maturing. We will have 5 varieties available to ship this season.</p>
<p>Over the summer, Cortijo el Puerto entered the Israel International Olive Oil Competition and received Gold awards for each of its 6 entries. Earlier in the year, the brand received 2 Gold awards at the New York International Olive Oil Competition for both of its entries. We also know that it's amazing from personal experience!</p>
<p>~Scott</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where are we now?</h3>
<p>The 2016 harvest is being bottled as we speak, and will be available to ship within a few weeks. We are asking for $5000 to cover the costs of the oil itself, the shipping, customs, and taxes. We're hoping to be able to order several hundred bottles from our Spanish partners, depending on interest from this campaign.</p>
<p>With each $20 contribution, you will receive a 250 ml bottle of either the Arbequina or Arbosana variety, and for $25 you can opt for the rarer bottles of either the Picual, Picudo, or Koroneiki varieties (supplies are limited).</p>
<p>If we don't reach our funding goal, we will still be importing what we can and everyone who makes a contribution will still get their bottle(s)!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Cortijo el Puerto comes from a trailblazing farm that is a significant departure from traditional monoculture-based practices. Engineered with the purpose of contributing to the local ecosystem rather than bulldozing over it, the farm integrates native flora and fauna within the grove to form a coherent biodiverse system. Exemplifying this fact is that each of the varieties of oil is represented by an animal that is found on the farm, from ducks to rabbits to owls. Please help us support them and their novel ecological approach to farming!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While we've started the customs importing process, some unforeseen hangup could cause a slight delay in shipping. However, we're confident that we will work through any problems and get this olive oil shipped promptly to you.</p>
<p>As we'll be shipping the bottles ourselves there is a risk that we could get overwhelmed with demand. That is one of the reasons why we are limiting the number of bottles available this year. With what we learn this year we hope to offer even more varieties next season!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you know someone who loves trying gourmet foods or is just an olive oil aficionado, spread the word!</p>

We are creating the first connected objects dedicated to horse performance and health care.​​​This project is dedicated to those who want to better take care of their horse.Often there’s a general lack of precise metrics and scientific approach in horse care. Performance training is very subjective, based on the instinct and experience of the breeder, coach or rider. The same goes for the horse’s fitness: constant monitoring and injury prevention issues are becoming more and more important for passionate riders.Even if the relationship between an owner and their horse is a very close one, animals cannot talk. Therefore, a continuous monitoring of your horse’s health should be a top priority for those who ride and care. Seaver helps to avoid overtraining and to identify health problems as soon as they arise.With our technology we want to enhance traditional training methods for equestrian sports - attentive riders, coaches and breeders will be able to introduce technology and precise metrics when preparing their training and competitions, all while taking care of their horse’s health.              The app is conceived for iOS, Android and connected watches, and developed in 3 languages​To meet the needs of the modern rider, we conceived the Seaver Girth and its “reduced version”, the Seaver Sleeve. The Seaver girth sleeve has exactly the same technological features as the Seaver Girth, therefore providing identical metrics and measurements. The Seaver Sleeve is made of modern neoprene fabric and carbon. The Seaver Girth's technology is embedded in a highly designed mix of leather and carbon, handmade in France.
Coupled with our dedicated mobile application, Seaver will allow riders and horse-owners to have:



Live streaming of riding data and the horse's vitals


Exhaustive post-practice metrics and analysis

                               Heart beat & respiratory patterns during training & competition                              Left and right hand analysis improving regularity                               Time spent on each gait                             Horizontal and vertical jump height                             Measure your speedFor those who wish to keep their old girth, the GIRTH SLEEVE fits all types of girth (anatomical, belly guard, low fits, endurance, western etc.)For those who want a modern girth with integrated state of the art technology, the Seaver Girth is available in 2 colors: BROWN and BLACK, and in 4 different models:

Anatomical fit


Low straps anatomical fit


Belly guard


Low straps belly guard

The girth is also available in 13 sizes:For the low fits-girths:{50cm; 55cm; 60cm; 65cm; 70cm}For the regular fit anatomical and the regular fit bellyguard:{110cm; 115cm; 120cm; 125cm; 130cm; 135cm; 140cm; 145cm}Seaver is designed to be easy to use. The materials and technology are innovative, but the design is still that of a cool, classy and traditional girth & girth sleeve.The rider must simply put the girth on, log in to our app and define the parameters of their horse, and they are good to go!If the rider wants to live stream their data, they will need a smartphone with them while riding.Once the training sessions are over, the data will be easily downloadable on your smartphone for a thorough post-exercise analysis.The data is easily accessible through the Seaver app and is stored indefinitely on our server.Monitor your horse’s health | Stress LevelsUsing an algorithm which combines the heart rate viability, the horse’s movement & respiratory rate, Seaver has a feature which measures your horse's stress levels - imperative for better following your horse's health.The core technology used for the Seaver Girth consists of a set of position sensors on 9 axes, ECG and respiratory sensors, and a special control unit.                             The Seaver Girth                           The Seaver girth sleeve                        One of our girths being hand-madeOur girth is entirely hand-made in France, using French leather and French anti-shock carbon with special attention for the ergonomics. All the materials are top of the range and carefully crafted to produce a high-quality girth. The girth sleeve is also hand-made in France with neoprene, to assure comfort and prevent any friction. Seaver was founded by Zakaria, a passionate horse rider and former semi-professional rider trained by a TOP30 international champion. He graduated from the HEC Business School in Paris and became director of the Hello Tomorrow Challenge, a global start-up competition focused on science, technology and entrepreneurship. His passion for innovation lead him to explore the world of connected objects and the new frontiers in the Internet of Things. As a rider, he has long identified the need for more precision in the practice of equestrian sports.Zak launched an evaluation phase, interviewing experts from both the tech and equestrian world, and began to work on the concept and long-term vision of the project.Once he met Pierre-Yves, now the CTO of Seaver, he saw the right co-founder to launch the company and begin the prototype phase with. Pierre-Yves comes from a previous successful experience as an embedded software and hardware engineer.Seaver partnered with Remy Trappier and Anass El Mahi, two design artists who worked both on the industrial and communication design elements.Today the core team consists of 8 people, with a good mix between business and technical expertise, coupled with a deep knowledge of horse riding.We work to improve the tracking of horses’ performance and health, and we do it because we love horses, we love riding them, and we see technology as a precious ally to our favourite animal!Seaver has been designed by loving riders, for loving riders. We are continuously testing our prototypes to improve each component, while also focusing on the ergonomics to ensure the horse's comfort. We rely on expert manufacturers who have worked with top-level French horse equipment providers.We took on some “extreme users” for our tests, especially in the jumping discipline; soon we will tackle some advanced tests also for the horse racing disciplines. We want our innovation to be of use for all equestrian and horse racing sports.Our app is being developed with all types of riders in mind and is conceived to be extremely user friendly. We hope you will love it! The coach and the veterinarian are crucial partners for taking good care of the horse and in preparing competitions.We envision riders sharing their training results with their coaches through our app, giving a new edge to the training process and taking health monitoring to the next level.The Seaver sensors are capable of detecting anomalies in your horse's condition, making it possible to immediately detect possible health problems and notifying the rider, who can then contact a veterinarian before potential damages worsen or the pain becomes more acute.Seaver wants to help trainers, coaches and riders with metrics and measurements, hoping to promote a more scientific approach in horse riding.That is why we developed a series of calculations, simplified in one view on our application, that will allow you to measure the intensity of your training, distinguishing the periods when you simply burned calories, when you ameliorated the cardio of your horse, and when you worked at high intensity.Furthermore, studying the variability of your horse’s heart frequency in respect to other variables such as the average gallop speed, will show your horse condition at a specific time. Thanks to a simplified data view on the Seaver app, you will be able to benchmark more precisely your horse’s condition and better prepare it for the next competition.Seaver is the first ever smart wearable that truly combine Heart Rate measurement with the locomotion, speed and movement of your horse giving an unprecedented insight of your horse fitness level.Here is an example of the work we have done to filter and interpret the signals, bringing you a clear view of your horse heart rate.Seaver stocks your raw data on our server, allowing for more advanced analysis in the future and comparison over different periods. The more the Seaver app is used, the more precise it will become and the more useful its analysis will be for the user. Statistical relevance will also increase with increased data, improving precision and benchmarking possibilities even further.Here is our timeline for the Seaver production:  The product is the combination of different sensors, integrated in a state-of-the-art piece of equipment. Here are some of the basic components:

</div></div>","Short Summary  We are the Michigan Association of Naturopathic Physicians and we are writing to request your support for legislation that will allow for licensure of Naturopathic physicians in the state of Michigan.
In 2015, the Michigan Association of Naturopathic Physicians (MANP) introduced House Bill 4531 into the House of Representatives Health Policy Committee. This bill will allow for licensure of naturopathic physicians in the state of Michigan.
 Licensure is important to us & Michigan residents because States that license naturopathic physicians allow the health care consumer access to physician-level, safe, effective, evidence-based natural health care. 
Licensure would also set standards for education of NDs and restrict the title ""naturopathic doctor and naturopathic physician"" to those licensed practitioners trained at institutions accredited by the U.S. Department of Education. By contributing to our licensure efforts you are taking part of a much needed change in our healthcare system: An opportunity to choose your primary care provider!

   What We Need & How You Can Help Excited to be a part of our cause? Here is how you can help:
DONATE MONEY: Help us reach our $5000 goal so we can continue to have enough funds to lobby for our cause!
BECOME A CORPORATE SPONSOR: Visit www.michnd.org and click on the'Corporate Sponsorship' link, under the 'Become A Corporate Sponsor' box at the bottom of the home page, to download a corporate sponsorship packet.
DONATE TIME: Volunteer to help us in our quest to bring a safer, more effective healthcare alternative to your community.
DONATE RESOURCES: Do you have access to resources that would further our cause?
SPREAD THE WORD: Tell everyone you know – family, friends, and colleagues – and get them involved in this important cause.
SPEAK YOUR MIND: Contact your representatives and discuss the importance of licensure of Naturopathic Medicine for the benefit of your family and community. 
The Impact
Naturopathic Physicians are the leading experts and specialists in natural medicine. Licensure will benefit the public health by providing expertise in the areas of drug-dietary supplement interactions, dietary supplement safety and efficacy issues, and the appropriate use of evidence based complementary therapies. It would also give YOU a benchmark by which to choose safe, qualified practitioners. Finally it would allow greater collaboration between medical/osteopathic and naturopathic physicians.
   Risks & Challenges  Our challenge at the moment is simply raising enough money so that we can continue to have a voice & push for our bill to be passed.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>James used to have bad sleep that he thought may have been a mental disorder because he was up all night tossing and turning. Tristan’s poor sleep made him irritable during the day.

He also had low energy.<br/><br/>Then, James discovered this thing called “blocking blue light.” He noticed there was a handful of blue light blocking options on the market including safety goggles with a yellow lens, ski goggles, and protective glasses.<br/><br/>But they were all ugly. James is pretty vain. He didn’t want to wear them. And he later discovered the options on the market didn’t block enough blue light responsible for disrupting sleep. So James decided to make a pair of stylish blue light blocking glasses. <br/><br/>He phoned up Tristan and said, “Hey, little brother! I have an idea to make a stylish pair of blue light blocking glasses! You want to help me?” (What're little brothers for?) The brothers spent nine months researching blue light and trying to produce the perfect orange lens, that actually worked. They also searched for the most stylish frames to house the blue-light blocking technology. (So James could try to look cool. ?)</p>
<p>In November 2015, they launched their sleep company, Swanwick Sleep and their blue light blocking glasses.Today, more than 35,000 happy customers have slept better because of Swannies blue light blocking glasses. </p>

They didn't address our needs as coaches and therapists, or the needs of our athletes.Our goal was to solve common issues our athletes were facing by creating a product that provided:
An intelligent new way to target all areas of the body
Innovative design that enhances circulation and hydration
A smart product that interacts safely with the body and spine
A new approach inspired by sports and massage therapists
Built in trigger caps for hard to reach tension points
Strong and durable, won't break down like foam rollers
A consistent pressure to prevent adaptation and desensitisation
A compact product that fits in gym bags or hand luggage easily
A smart and easily accessible education platform
Applied evidence based research
The Waveblade sports roller is the first sports massage tool that accurately and effectively targets all areas of the body.  The patent-pending Waveblade pattern is designed to safely and effectively create a high-to-low varying pressure system, that allows for the maximum amount of blood to reach tight and damaged muscles, to enhance tissue hydration and speed recovery after exercise. The centre blades of the Waveblade are precisely designed to engage the back muscles and fascia located on either side of the spine, improving spinal mobility and posture.  The Waveblade’s multiple contact points stretch muscles and fascia (connective tissue) in multiple and opposing directions simultaneously, providing a more effective release. This is a highly effective technique used by sports therapists. The Waveblade's two Trigger-Caps provide athletes and therapists complete control, allowing them to target hard-to-reach tension points and regulate pressure accordingly.  Easy to hold or to place on the floor, Trigger-Caps won't roll away and move out of the desired position like massage balls do.Each Trigger-Cap has a different shape to uniquely target different parts of the body. The small Trigger-Cap targets muscles such as the gluteal group and hip flexors.The large Trigger-Cap targets hard to reach muscles such as the pectoralis and sternocleidomastoid (SCM) upper chest and neck groups.Additionally, the trigger caps also clip into place, providing a discrete storage space for valuables whilst training, or in transit.The Waveblade has been precision engineered to be strong, durable and compact. Allowing it to withstand the heavy loads and repetitive use of intense training schedules.The blades themselves are made of a silicon compound that won’t break down like foam rollers do. This provides a constant reliable pressure for athletes, encourages consistent mobility gains, and avoids muscular adaptation (elasticity) and desensitisation (receptors). Fits neatly into gym bag, hand luggage or suitcase, for athletes on the move. Your mobile massage therapist.With innovation, comes new education - We have developed the Release Move Improve education system and created an online exercise library to ensure the latest techniques and concepts are easily accessible to all Waveblade users.

</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Mark, creator and co-founder of CalorieWiz, started his weight loss journey 7 years ago, when he weighed 222lbs.

<p><strong>How are calories calculated?</strong></p>
<p>CalorieWiz uses the Harris Benedict Equation to calculate your basal metabolic rate (BMR). Your basal metabolic rate is the amount of calories needed if you were to lay around with no energy expenditure. The Harris Benedict Equation uses your BMR and applies the activity level (energy expenditure) that best describes your lifestyle to determine your daily caloric maintenance level (the amount of calories to consume to maintain your current weight). CalorieWiz uses this to calculate the amount of calories to consume in order to hit your goal! Remember that everyone is different, and everyone's numbers will be different depending on the factors below. In order to hit your goals, it is best to be as accurate as possible when selecting the options below.</p>
<p>Age<br/>Height<br/>Weight<br/>Sex<br/>Goal<br/>Activity Level</p>
<p><strong>Can I enter my own workouts?</strong></p>
<p>No. When you register, you select the activity level that best describes your average day. The activity level selected includes the average amount of calories you burn during a typical day. Therefore, if you exercise 30 minutes per day, you do not need to enter the calories you have burnt, as it's already been accounted for.</p>

HOW IT ALL STARTED

Mark, creator and co-founder of CalorieWiz, started his weight loss journey 7 years ago, when he weighed 222lbs. He mapped out his weight loss plan, which consisted of 30-40 minutes of exercise 5 times per week and only eating healthy foods. He noticed that his weight loss was minimal, with only 4-5 pounds in the first month.
He soon discovered that it wasn’t the quality of food you put in your body, it’s calories in vs. calories out that achieves your weight loss goals.
Mark decided to count calories and no longer follow a restrictive diet. The results were immediate, within the first 2 weeks, he was able to lose 5 lbs, and in total lost 52 lbs.
He was asked how he lost his weight, and he responded ""it’s simple, calories in vs. calories out. Start logging and measuring your foods and you will achieve the same outcome."" Many people started but gave up quickly due to complicated databases, not knowing what to eat and the amount of time and effort it takes to plan your day around eating. 
All this led to creating the world's newest and most revolutionary weight loss app, called CalorieWiz, that counts calories for you!

<br/><br/>Why this technology?</h3>
<p><br/>My name is Garrett Murrin and I work for <a href=""https://www.radiant-life-technologies.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Radiant Life Technologies</a>, where we’ve been producing medical devices – like the <a href=""https://comra-delta.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">coMra Delta</a> and the <a href=""https://comra-palm.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">coMra Palm</a> – for over a decade.</p>
<p>After years of research, we came to understand the relationship between harmful electromagnetic radiation, its effect upon the quality of our water, and the negative results of this upon our health. In short, we discovered that <strong><i>healthy</i></strong> <strong><i>water</i></strong> is key to optimal health.</p>
<p>We’ve developed a way to re-generate healthy water, and offer a level of protection against harmful electromagnetic radiation: introducing coMra Wave technology. If you haven’t already, please watch our video above for more detailed information.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We need your support NOW</h3>
<p>We need US$50,000 to produce an initial batch of three stand-alone products; the coMra Wave Cell – attached to your smart phone, laptop, tablet, etc. for EMF protection; the coMra Wave Pendant – worn close to the body for a 24hr effect; and the coMra Wave Coaster – used to re-generate your drinking water.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>coMra Wave product line</h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571756978/o2tgdpffm0k4fqotqfzw.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Designed for mobile phone, tablet, laptop – or any device that emits a communications signal – the coMra Wave Cell is a truly unique dual-purpose device. Firstly, it offers a level of protection against harmful electromagnetic radiation; and secondly, it re-energises the water in your body, or any water containing structure within a 13 cm radius.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571734715/u91hwdftwagykahuy63f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The outer octagon shell is made from hard-wearing, food-grade matt silicone, with a strong adhesive layer at the back for attaching to your device.</p>
<p>The silicone outer shell contains a Printed Circuit Board with a patented 6-layer system. This system absorbs the harmful electromagnetic radiation, converts it, creates a vortex signature and then imprints that signature of re-energised wave forms back into your body.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571773501/wtfvyxqax65cgwo9teub.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>The coMra Wave Coaster is in essence a coMra Wave Cell embedded in the same hard-wearing, food-grade matt silicone material. With a surface area large enough for your glass, mug or plastic bottle, it takes less than 10 minutes for the coMra Wave technology to re-energise one litre of your drinking water.</p>
<p>The octagonal surface has an indented spiral-grid pattern, designed for catching condensation and light spills.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Made from luxurious hand-polished zirconium, the coMra Wave Pendant is the pinnacle of the coMra Wave line. A double-sided finish – Black &amp; Pearl White – makes for a unique, unisex impression, designed for everyday wear – on a chain, on a key fob or for anywhere next to the skin – and maximum protection.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571740045/pw7glxad91iaxwgcugiv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The coMra Wave Pendant offers the greatest level of protection, with a multi-layer system of 7. This system absorbs the harmful electromagnetic radiation, transforms it and creates the vortex signature. The additional 7th layer is a quartz crystal interface engineered to accumulate and deliver of the vortex signature back into your body with greater efficiency than a standard coMra Wave Cell.</p>

<h3>Economical and ecological</h3>
<p>coMra Wave technology does not use batteries or have any moving parts. It's completely self-powered using the ambient electromagnetic radiation as its power source. Longevity of the devices depend on physical wear only.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We know that coMra Wave technology will be of enormous benefit to users, especially in light of the big push toward the deployment of 5G networks around the world – pumping out harmful EMF with further negative consequences to our health.</p>

We need US$50,000 to produce an initial batch of three stand-alone products; the coMra Wave Cell – attached to your smart phone, laptop, tablet, etc. for EMF protection; the coMra Wave Pendant – worn close to the body for a 24hr effect; and the coMra Wave Coaster – used to re-generate your drinking water.
 
coMra Wave product line

 
Designed for mobile phone, tablet, laptop – or any device that emits a communications signal – the coMra Wave Cell is a truly unique dual-purpose device. Firstly, it offers a level of protection against harmful electromagnetic radiation; and secondly, it re-energises the water in your body, or any water containing structure within a 13 cm radius.

The outer octagon shell is made from hard-wearing, food-grade matt silicone, with a strong adhesive layer at the back for attaching to your device.
The silicone outer shell contains a Printed Circuit Board with a patented 6-layer system. This system absorbs the harmful electromagnetic radiation, converts it, creates a vortex signature and then imprints that signature of re-energised wave forms back into your body.
 

 

 
The coMra Wave Coaster is in essence a coMra Wave Cell embedded in the same hard-wearing, food-grade matt silicone material. With a surface area large enough for your glass, mug or plastic bottle, it takes less than 10 minutes for the coMra Wave technology to re-energise one litre of your drinking water.
The octagonal surface has an indented spiral-grid pattern, designed for catching condensation and light spills.

The embedded coMra Wave Cell contains a Printed Circuit Board with a multi-layer system of 6. This system absorbs harmful electromagnetic radiation, creates the vortex signature, then imprints re-energised wave forms back into your drink.
 

 

 
Made from luxurious hand-polished zirconium, the coMra Wave Pendant is the pinnacle of the coMra Wave line. A double-sided finish – Black & Pearl White – makes for a unique, unisex impression, designed for everyday wear – on a chain, on a key fob or for anywhere next to the skin – and maximum protection.
The coMra Wave Pendant offers the greatest level of protection, with a multi-layer system of 7. This system absorbs the harmful electromagnetic radiation, transforms it and creates the vortex signature. The additional 7th layer is a quartz crystal interface engineered to accumulate and deliver of the vortex signature back into your body with greater efficiency than a standard coMra Wave Cell.
 

 
Unlock bonus
The more funds we raise the more bonus options we can unlock. For example, every US$15,000 we raise past the US$30,000, mark gives us the required means to offer more colour options. So, please, spread the word and tell your family and friends about us!

How does that multi-layer system work?
 




 


Economical and ecological
coMra Wave technology does not use batteries or have any moving parts. It's completely self-powered using the ambient electromagnetic radiation as its power source. Longevity of the devices depend on physical wear only.
 

The Impact
We know that coMra Wave technology will be of enormous benefit to users, especially in light of the big push toward the deployment of 5G networks around the world – pumping out harmful EMF with further negative consequences to our health.",23.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>At Foodtodo, we love healthy and tasty food and we see that in the 20th century many of people fight with nutritional diseases such as IBS, lactose intolerance, and diabetes.</p>
<p>So instead of solving one problem, we decided to create a 2 in 1 solution.</p>
<p>In one way it is a platform for the nutrition professionals to manage their practice, in another way it is oriented to people who want to cook healthy meals, consult a nutritionist, or daily track their lifestyle goals.</p>

<img alt=""Sophie Michelin"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://storage.googleapis.com/foodtodo/promo/team/sophie-michelin.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;margin-right:26px;width: 250px !important;""/><p>My name is Sophie Michelin and I am the Founder of FoodToDo. I am a mother of 5, chef, sommelier and a nutrition expert. The whole story started when my patchwork family came regularly to spend Christmas and Summer time with us and I needed to combine lactose intolerance, strawberry and tomato allergy with my starch free diet. I was hoping there’d be a solution for that. As a chef I looked around and saw that most of the weight loss intents fail and many of my friends suffer from insulin resistance, prediabetes and depression which are mostly caused by unhealthy, high sugar diets.</p>
<p>This is why I created FoodToDo, a solution aimed at both individuals, family members, nutritionists and other diet related professionals as well. Our mission is to abolish diet   related non-communicable diseases that are caused by wrong nutrition: from heart disease to diabetes, obesity and other preventable conditions. At the same time we want to offer an easy solution, connecting you with your online food delivery or with the restaurant nearby.</p>
<p>I always listen to my body what it needs, what is nutritious for me and for my kids. And we would like to implement the same philosophy in FoodToDo. Coaching people to understand their body and redesign their diet, with small steps at the time. The last months we worked to get the diet expert community helping us and we’ve got so many input, support and inspirational emails from nutrition professors such Mikael Fogelholm, from University Helsinki to medical evangelists Dr David Katz from Health Initiatives. We contacted thousands of nutritionists and already feeling and experiencing that the crowd is growing around the same cause.</p>
<p>I believe with your support we can turn back the statistics and eliminate diet related non communicable diseases. I am thankful to each of and single support we can gain by contributing to the campaign or simply spread the world: Let’s food be our medicine!</p>

</div></div>","FoodToDo - Making Food Personal
At Foodtodo, we love healthy and tasty food and we see that in the 20th century many of people fight with nutritional diseases such as IBS, lactose intolerance, and diabetes.
So instead of solving one problem, we decided to create a 2 in 1 solution.
In one way it is a platform for the nutrition professionals to manage their practice, in another way it is oriented to people who want to cook healthy meals, consult a nutritionist, or daily track their lifestyle goals.
FoodToDo is our consumer solution, perfect for any health-conscious families and individuals or those suffering diet-related conditions while FoodToDo Pro is our web-based app, tailor-made for nutrition professionals aimed at digitizing their practice, allowing them to connect with and monitor their clients using FoodToDo.

About the Founder
My name is Sophie Michelin and I am the Founder of FoodToDo. I am a mother of 5, chef, sommelier and a nutrition expert. The whole story started when my patchwork family came regularly to spend Christmas and Summer time with us and I needed to combine lactose intolerance, strawberry and tomato allergy with my starch free diet. I was hoping there’d be a solution for that. As a chef I looked around and saw that most of the weight loss intents fail and many of my friends suffer from insulin resistance, prediabetes and depression which are mostly caused by unhealthy, high sugar diets.
This is why I created FoodToDo, a solution aimed at both individuals, family members, nutritionists and other diet related professionals as well. Our mission is to abolish diet   related non-communicable diseases that are caused by wrong nutrition: from heart disease to diabetes, obesity and other preventable conditions. At the same time we want to offer an easy solution, connecting you with your online food delivery or with the restaurant nearby.
I always listen to my body what it needs, what is nutritious for me and for my kids. And we would like to implement the same philosophy in FoodToDo. Coaching people to understand their body and redesign their diet, with small steps at the time. The last months we worked to get the diet expert community helping us and we’ve got so many input, support and inspirational emails from nutrition professors such Mikael Fogelholm, from University Helsinki to medical evangelists Dr David Katz from Health Initiatives. We contacted thousands of nutritionists and already feeling and experiencing that the crowd is growing around the same cause.
I believe with your support we can turn back the statistics and eliminate diet related non communicable diseases. I am thankful to each of and single support we can gain by contributing to the campaign or simply spread the world: Let’s food be our medicine!

What will we do with the funding?
In order to grow our company and further develop our product we estimated that we would need about $25,000.
The amount will be used to enhance our user experience. You will be our first testers of the enhanced user experience and in the event of not reaching our goal we will invest the amount to improve our UX.

The Impact
Current Statistics
Every 4th person is obese or overweight in the world. With more than 300 million diabetic people worldwide and over 17 million yearly deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases, we believe that our solution can significantly lower the number of non-communicable diseases worldwide by improving people’s diet and teaching them vital information about their macro and micronutrient needs.
  Cardiovascular Statistics 

17.7 million people die each year from cardiovascular diseases, an estimated 31% of all deaths worldwide
Over 75% of CVDs occur in low-income and middle-income families
80% of all CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes

By late-2018 we aim at partnering with the main nutrition associations from the EU, US and Oceania

Continuously improve our solutions with the help of tech companies and health organizations


CSR
The future of our society in the hands of our children.
Working with people from across the world has taught us that an early education about health and food is the key to grow a healthy and responsible society. Because of this, starting from 2018, we have decided to join and establish local programs in the UK, Finland and Hungary to teach children important information about food and how to cook.

Sophie Michelin CEO“One of my biggest challenges is to organise my time around work and family duties. I love cooking and as a chef, I enjoy spontaneity in my kitchen. Although making 5 meals per day for my family could hinder that. With our platform, my goal was to put structure into days when I just need healthy and quick meals and still be spontaneous when I create recipes for special occasions.”


Daniel Szohatzky CTO“Being a technical guy with a cooking sense makes the perfect combination for molecular cooking... Well, not quite. But good ground for experimenting new ways in cooking and giving technical background in developing a project with great opportunities and intention to help sustainable and healthy food (to do).”


Zsofia Rutkai Product Owner - FoodToDo“I am a design and project manager with a background in communication. I enjoy supporting product development processes and working together with multidisciplinary teams. Exploring new meals and creating food is my passion. I am a hobby chef and during my life I also could learn the importance of healthy lifestyle and well being which can be part of one's success. I am happy to be part of creating products that inspire people to live a better and more efficient life.”


Ildi Holdampf Product Owner - FoodToDo PRO“Although my family is a small one, they like to have fresh food every day and dislike eating the same food for days. After a while, I wasn’t able to change my ”cooking-8-dishes-in-40- minutes” routine because I don’t want to spend the days grocery shopping and cooking: I’d rather spend my free time with my kids. I started to be bored and frustrated with planning and cooking, it became a chore, and was not fun anymore. Being part of the creation of this platform, I gained my creativity back to impress my family with taste.”


Lissa Leader Nutrition Advisor UK“I am passionate about making the nutrients in food work for you! I truly believe that good nutrition can help to restore balance in the body by addressing digestive issues and any nutritional imbalances that could be impeding a route to optimum health and vitality. There is wisdom in the saying, We are what we eat!”


Cristian Nechifor Community Manager/Regional Sales Manager“Ever since I started my sports career years ago I’ve been an advocate of healthy eating and food analysis. I believe that selling a product in 2017 requires a much more customer-centric approach and it is my passion to communicate and understand the needs of the people we work with. I invest my free time coaching American Football and cooking delicious meals for my significant other.”

<h2>Help Save Mom's House</h2>
<p>My Mom, Gayne Preller Schmidt, is a humble woman that would give you the shirt off her back if she thought it would help you... Unfortunately, the time and energy she has donated has not helped her bank account (Mom has donated funds to many causes / fundraisers for local and state organizations)... She has never asked for anyones help in the past, but I'm asking, on her behalf, because I've seen and worked side by side with her for many years...</p>
<ul>
<li>Mom, Gayne, was born in Denmark, AR in 1933. She has always had a passion for family, historical landmarks, history and wildlife/environment. She, of course, receives her Social Security Check, still works part time as an instructor in a computer lab for Crowley's Ridge Vo-Tech, and has an alterations shop which took in about $2,700 in 2011. Her utilities and telephone cost was much more than what she made (but she loves to sew, and it keeps her active). In addition to those two jobs, she is very active in civic affairs; Chamber of Commerce, Augusta Improvement Club, American Legion Auxiliary, United Methodist Women (local), Augusta Business and Professional Women, and White River Conservancy (which she organized)--all of which she is past President (except ABPW--Secretary) most of which she was in office several years, and in addition still holds offices in the organizations. She is on the Executive Board of Arkansas Wildlife Federation and represented Arkansas several years (until last year) in D.C. with the National Wildlife Federation. I offer the above information to support a ""most worthy"" designation. Her need is for major repairs to her home (108 years old, and eligible for the National Register) for which she has no funds to make it safe. We (my sisters and I) are unable to help her because of our own circumstances. Mom has owned the house since 1974. No repairs have been done on the house since 2003 when her husband died, except for the new roof that was never finished and improperly installed (which needs repair also)--the roofer put the correct color shingles on the back 3/4th of the house and a bright green on the front---he never finished the install when the mistake was mentioned and has never answered calls since... She is still active in the organizations, and is always doing something for others--never expecting anything in return. She bakes bread every week for the ill, shut-ins, bereaved---even supplies Communion Bread for our church. She has been recognized by the Business and Professional Women's local club as ""Woman of the Year"" and received the 2009 Augusta Industrial Development Corp ""Outstanding Service Award"" presented by Dr. Steve Collier with the Governor of Arkansas present. She still does daily watering and weeding, usually alone, at the two parks in downtown Augusta, AR, as chair of the parks committee. However, as deserving and grateful for the recognition, none of this has brought her any funds, and as tirelessly giving and faithful to the organizations to which she belongs, and to the church and community, we would be so pleased to see her receive some help to make her house safe and more like a home. She is embarrassed to invite friends / even family over (even for coffee) because of the risk anyone takes just crossing the porch (that stands 5 feet off the ground supported by the orginal brick columns), and that really hurts us because she was always an ""open house"", warm and generous hostess...</li>
<li>The entire house is in need of repair, but the front and back porches are the most pressing... I thought it best to ask for help funding the repairs the home is in most urgently needed... Various family members have fallen through the deteriorating front porch floor boards, but luckily my 79 year old Mother has not!!! The goal amount is the lowest of three estimates that Gayne has gotten for repairs...</li>
<li>We know her dream was to always turn her home into a Bed and Breakfast Heritage Inn just a block away from the White River (which would be a perfect place for anyone that wishes to visit this hunting and fishing paradise) ...We would love to eventually make this dream a reality, and with your (and the rest of the world's) help---I believe it will be a reality sooner than my Mom's dreams!!!</li>

<h3>Safety for visitors of Mom</h3>
<ul>
<li>The goal of $16,000 is just to cover the restoration of the front and back porches (the front porch is in the video and the back porch has completely fallen off of the house---making the two back doors unuseable)...</li>
<li>Any additional funds over the $16,000 goal will go toward hiring another roofer to finish and repair the first roofers shoddy work, repair to the plaster of the ceilings and walls throughtout the house and repainting them, hanging sheetrock upstairs to finish the four bedrooms, and upgrade the heating and air conditioning system.</li>
<li>If the goal of $16,000 is not reached the funds that are collected will be used to repair the porches to the best of the contractors abilities...</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>The History of the House</h3>
<p>According to Arkansas Historical Preservation Group there are similar homes thoughout the state, but none that have the ornate architectural features that Mom's house has...</p>
<ul>
<li>The house was built in 1904 by the Eldridge family; they sold it to the Cain family in 1908, and the Cain's lived there until Mom and Dad bought the house in 1974... History tells us that the Eldridge family had the home built, William R. Cain was a County, Municipal, and District Judge and also Justice of the Peace, and Mom has owned several small businesses in town since her and Dad's move from Memphis, TN in 1974 (to be closer to her elderly Mother, Ollie Preller, now deceased) </li>
<li>It is important to the the town's history to restore this house because many of the homes of this age have either been condemned and torn down or have burned.</li>
</ul><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand and associate with the fact that not everyone can help monetarily, but we urge you to help us ""get the word out"" for the preservation on this once magnificent landmark historical home...</p>

The house was built in 1904 by the Eldridge family; they sold it to the Cain family in 1908, and the Cain's lived there until Mom and Dad bought the house in 1974... History tells us that the Eldridge family had the home built, William R. Cain was a County, Municipal, and District Judge and also Justice of the Peace, and Mom has owned several small businesses in town since her and Dad's move from Memphis, TN in 1974 (to be closer to her elderly Mother, Ollie Preller, now deceased) 
It is important to the the town's history to restore this house because many of the homes of this age have either been condemned and torn down or have burned.
Other Ways You Can Help
We understand and associate with the fact that not everyone can help monetarily, but we urge you to help us ""get the word out"" for the preservation on this once magnificent landmark historical home...

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Launching Evolve online has been a dream of mine for the past 4 years and it is finally ready to be released to the public that so desperately needs it.  In the United States alone over 66% of our population is over weight or obese and what drives me the most is thinking of all the parents, children, aunts, uncles, friends and relatives who's lives are cut short due to a lack of time, drive and/or knowledge.  Your pledge will help us change that.  Evolve will give each and every user the tools to own their fitness, control their health and live a better life.  </p>
<p>I grew up in a very active family with parents who love me, supported me as I played soccer and instilled in me the belief that I could do or be anything I wanted.  As I grew into an adult I watched as both of my parents suffered with heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and other ailments associated with inactivity all while working 40-60 hour work weeks to support their family.  </p>
<p>I live in another state with my wife but knew there had to be a way to help them without being physically in front of them.  So we started with the basics, learned about proper foods to eat, gave them detailed-video-guided workouts they could do no matter how much time they had and kept them on track by checking in each day.  Medications were lowered, doctors were amazed and lives were changed as both of my parents became healthier and stronger simply by being given the information, the motivation and the direction.  </p>
<p>There is no greater joy than to see the lives of those you love changed for ever, to see them smile when they realize the power within themselves to control their health and to see them year after year getting stronger, happier and fitter.  I want to share that with you, with your family and with those you love.  I want to help people Evolve and Change Their Lives.</p>

No more wondering if you are doing the right exercises, the right way and at the right intensity. With a focus on both functional training and education our classes will give you the tools to succeed.  Evolve will stream high quality fitness videos to your smart phone, tablet, computer or television when it's convenient for you.  We will regularly produce a myriad of fitness classes including Yoga, Body Weight, HIIT, Pilates, Dance, Kettle bell, Dumbbell, Medicine Ball and even Treadmill classes so that you can train how you want when you want.  
FUEL YOUR FITNESS



Nutritional Coaching, Tracking, Reporting and Education will guide you to a higher quality of life.  Registered Dietitians will teach you healthy habits, meal preparation, and  nutritious recipes. We dispel the numerous myths/hype of quick fixes that exist in the world.  Learn what to eat, when to eat, how to prepare it, how to adapt and how to make it a part of your life. 
STAY ON TRACK


Part of reaching your goals, progressing and evolving is staying on track, measuring progress and being held accountable.  With Evolve we help you select effective habits, hold you accountable to them and show your progress along the way.  This is your life, your health, your fitness and your happiness and with Evolve we will help you make the most of every single day.TRUST US

Doctors, Physicians, Registered Dietitians, Licensed Therapists & Several Certified Fitness Professionals are on our board.  Evolve is grounded in science and built around some of the greatest professionals in the world.  The information you receive will be of the highest quality, supported by fact, not opinion, and will give you the piece of mind you deserve when looking for answers for your health.  

THE PROBLEM:
Our goal at Evolve is to give you the tools and help you overcome obstacles. Through our experience we've learned the main health and fitness stumbling blocks have been:

Not knowing what to do or how to do it.
No time to exercise.
Not motivated.
Bored.
Intimidated by fitness myths & conflicting information.
Don't like the gym.

THE SOLUTION:
Evolve came up with a solution to keep you going, educate you, excite you and most importantly help you change your life.

Make Fitness & Exercise Convenient
Make It Engaging 
Keep It Science Based and ""Fad Proof""
Give People Motivation
Keep People Accountable
Make It Customizable
Make It Fun & Social
Keep It at Home, Work, Travel, Wherever You Go. 

YOUR CLASSES

The classes that you watch will be instructive, visually engaging and available any time you want them.  Certified and licensed fitness professionals guide you through Yoga, Pilates, Strength, Core, Bodyweight, Circuit, Cardio and many other classes in order to ensure you perform the movements efficiently and effectively.  Each video will provide several camera angles, visual animation guides and audio cues to coach you through the entire session.  The videos we produce are unlike any other fitness dvd because we want to educate you as you exercise so you continue to progress with each class.
What We Need & What You Get
We need your help to launch the website, mobile apps and produce these amazing fitness classes:

The bulk of the funds raised will be directed to video class production.  Our instructors, editors, producers, equipment and filming process gets to be quite costly and we are shooting each class with cinema quality cameras so that you see every move in HD and can examine every detail.  Evolve will give you the most engaging and instructive fitness videos you have ever experienced.
The other area where we need funds is to complete the development of the final version of the website, mobile app and television app to ensure that fitness & health are easy to access, can go anywhere you can and to ensure that we can help as many people as possible improve their lives.





If we don't reach our entire goal we will make a decision based on the funding received thus far what features will be included in the initial launch that will be worth it to our backers or if we can't raise enough to launch a product that will help change lives we will refund all pledges.

<p></p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<div><p>Our trip has been funded through Namibian Cycling Federation and by P.A.Y. and it covers accommodation, food and cycling equipment for the 45 days of camp. However we require pocket money, approx. 150 EUR each. This is 3 x 150 = 450 EUR. The funds will go into our daily needs not covered by the camp.</p></div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>We are a team of cyclists competing against the odds. Just a year ago, we didn't exist as a team. In the meantime, we have won a number of races nationally, competed internationally and we now have the chance to crown this amazing year by attending the camp whicih may mean the start of our professional career. Moreover, as the first elite team produced within the P.A.Y. cycling project, we are a role models for approximately 100 learners who take part in the Physically Active Youth programme. We want to show those kids that hard work pays off and that they can take charge of their future.</div>

<p><strong>Krysia Energy Power Yoga</strong></p>
<p>Yoga is an unconditional home that is always there for you, whether you’re feeling up or down – no matter where you are emotionally that day.  I truly believe that yoga slows the whirlings of the mind, and breaks the patterns of those repetitive, and often toxic, thoughts that can dominate the mind. Even if you come to yoga only with the intention of getting a great sweat and workout, (which admittedly was the case for me when I first started all those years ago), these benefits will come.  My Power Yoga practice is a great heat-producing, energy exerting practice that will prepare your body for seated meditation. Yet these instructions are not commands, and I always emphasize the need to honor your body. You cannot be more gentle and kind to others until you are more gentle and kind to yourself.</p>

<p><br/>I have been teaching classes for over 10 years and have guided hundreds of students across the country in Ashtanga Vinyasa yoga practice since 2003.  I teach because I want to share this experience with others, and through this video, I can provide that “home” to those that can’t make it to a class due to any number of circumstances. </p>

<p>My friend Rahul and I speak on the telephone a couple important days of the year, Christmas/ Birthdays, but recently he called and asked if I was able to help.  This is the first time in 6 years Rahul has asked for anything.  He told me the clinic needs simple medications and supplies, ranging from pediatric vitamins to gloves and medical tape.  I told Rahul that I would speak to my friends, family and co-workers to see if there is anything we could contribute.    </p>
<p>It is my goal to raise one thousand dollars by May 20th.  This money will then be sent to a co-workers family member in Delhi who owns a pharmacy.  The supplies will be picked up by Rahul and taken 7 hours north to Than Gaon.  If done this way we can save money on shipping supplies and cheaper medication prices in Delhi.  </p>
<p>The thousand dollar goal needs to be met by May 20th, if it is not, all contributions will be returned in full.  Please help by spreading the word and gving what you can.  </p>

<p>Matthew Hepler</p></div>","In 2006 I spent 2 months in India.  Most of that time was spent with a man named Rahul Wali, operator of Nature Quest India in the village of Than Gaon.  Nature Quest is the home for a medical clinic and childrens school.  The Than Gaon Medical Clinic is staffed by one local physician and two or three volunteers at a time.  The clinic will treat residents of Than Gaon, although there are many who cannot make the trip to the village of Than Gaon let alone the closest city of Dehra Dun.  The clinic staff most days of the week travel 2-3 hours by foot to neighboring villages, treating  children and those who cannot travel.  The childrens school at Than Gaon takes pride in its 46 students, studying english, health and giving them hope as they prepare for the future.  
My friend Rahul and I speak on the telephone a couple important days of the year, Christmas/ Birthdays, but recently he called and asked if I was able to help.  This is the first time in 6 years Rahul has asked for anything.  He told me the clinic needs simple medications and supplies, ranging from pediatric vitamins to gloves and medical tape.  I told Rahul that I would speak to my friends, family and co-workers to see if there is anything we could contribute.    
It is my goal to raise one thousand dollars by May 20th.  This money will then be sent to a co-workers family member in Delhi who owns a pharmacy.  The supplies will be picked up by Rahul and taken 7 hours north to Than Gaon.  If done this way we can save money on shipping supplies and cheaper medication prices in Delhi.  
The thousand dollar goal needs to be met by May 20th, if it is not, all contributions will be returned in full.  Please help by spreading the word and gving what you can.  
 
Thank you to everyone,

Mercury poisoning affects thousands of people. Many victims are too poor to help themselves. I am working towards the elimination of mercury use in small-scale gold mining (mostly illegal) in my home country, Indonesia, and in other countries. In the last 10 years, the world has witnessed an increasing number of  people suffering from mercury poisoning in gold mining hotspots-- many were not even gold miners but family members. This reminds me of the unresolved Minamata tragedy in Japan in the 1950s which brought tears to my eyes.

For my 50th birthday, I am launching a campaign that could help these innocent victims. Many are unaware that they are suffering from mercury poisoning because some of the symptoms are similar to more common diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. Drugs and treatments are available to help them, but proper assessment must first be carried out by trained health workers. 
   The plan  My plan is to support victims in remote villages by providing nurses to help assess, treat and monitor their health. These villages are strewn with gold-processing facilities and gold shops that use the mercury. The fund will be appropriately divided between assessment and treatment. For this project, I am planning to help 50 people from a number of villages in West Java and Lombok to get the correct medication for 12 months.In order to do this, I need $30,000. This includes the cost to pay the nurses over the 12 months period ($3,051), their transport ($2,034), and for the medicine ($24,915).   Why you should donateMercury poisoning is a type of metal poisoning caused by exposure to mercury (direct or indirect). Almost all small-scale gold mines in developing countries use mercury to separate gold from other metals. The miners do not usually wear protective equipment when handling the mercury, which can cause it to be absorbed by the skin and enter their bloodstream. Once mercury is in a persons blood, there is no way to get it out. The body does not have a natural mechanism that allows mercury to be excreted from the body. Mercury in the air can travel distances. It can poison neighbouring villages-- including children and pregnant mothers. It can also enter water and soil which can quickly poison the food chain. Mercury poisoning can damage the brain, kidneys, lungs, digestive system, and motor system. It is one of the least understood diseases, especially since the symptoms are hard to tell apart from malaria and dengue fever. The victims desperately need proper medical assessment leading to effective treatment.
