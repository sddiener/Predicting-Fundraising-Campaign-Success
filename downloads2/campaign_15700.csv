At the same time, Phantom Power Films announced their intention to travel to Catalonia to interview people on the ground in the aftermath of their independence referendum. We believe that is an important project to support, so we pledged to swing the final 3 days of this crowdfunder - that is, monies donated past the original target - to this new emergency project.</p><p><strong>Every penny of the money donated towards the original target of £3,410 will go towards Scotland's Choice, as originally described below.</strong></p><p>Donations beyond this point (100% funded at 7.01pm 2nd November 2017) will be transferred to the Phantom Power Films project in Catalonia.</p><p>The reason for the small change is simply the fast-moving events in Catalonia which we believe will have a strong political bearing on indyref2. We opted to forward the ""overflow"" from this fundraiser (after the 100% target was met) to this new worthy project. <strong>This was purely to save time and avoid delays in getting a film crew out to Catalonia.</strong></p><p>Any original funders who object to this, we will happily - and without question - refund their donations.  For further information or enquiries, please use the contact form on this website and we will respond as quickly as possible. Thank you.</p><p>*** UPDATE ENDS ***</p><p>We’ve come a long way since 2014. However you voted back then, or in the 2016 EU Referendum, the situation facing us today is completely different.</p><p>The UK is leaving the EU. The Brent oil price has halved. We have a shambolic ideologically-driven UK government seemingly hell-bent on ‘hard Brexit’. Trump is in the White House. The SNP lost its Holyrood majority (though crucially not its mandate). Catalonia has voted for independence - so far denied by an increasingly fascist Spanish state.</p><p>Some things <i>haven’t</i> changed. The newspapers are still full of politically-motivated drivel, and our state broadcaster only seems interested in mentioning Scotland if it plays badly for the SNP. The Tories are still pushing austerity and nonsense ""economics"", and the Scottish Labour party is having <i>another</i> leadership election.</p><p> </p><p>After the 2014 indyref, I went looking for answers to the unanswered question that still burned in my mind; how could Scotland, one of the most resource-rich and intellectually gifted countries in the world, <i>not afford to be independent?</i> Why do the GERS figures just make <i>no</i> sense?</p><p>What I discovered on my journey was a far more complex story, a fabric of intertwined threads stretching back years and, in some cases, centuries, all bringing us to a nexus point in 2017. The story of how Scotland reached this point is incredibly rich, full of heroes and villains, high-powered politics and global economics. There are so many incredible pieces to the story, and they are being brought together now <i>for the very first time</i>.</p><p>Meticulously researched and referenced, <strong>Scotland’s Choice </strong>explains - in plain language with minimal jargon - the political and economic forces that brought us to an inevitable choice between Britain and Europe. It lays out the options before us, demystifies Brexit, and unearths the crucial evidence missing from the Scottish Government’s 2013 White Paper. <strong>Perhaps most importantly, it <i>completely destroys</i> the so-called “economic case” for the union with England.</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>What do we need?</strong></p><p>Time and money - as always! The book itself is about three-quarters written in an unedited state. The key pieces of research are all in place, but I need access to some more specialised texts which, because of their complexity and the small audience for them, cost a bit of money (hence the crowdfunder!). I also need to bring in some experts to proof-read and cross-check my work. Again, mostly it’s <i>time</i> that is the crucial resource rather than money.</p><p>In terms of the money, I need to cover modest living expenses for 3 months – that’s £1,800. For the research materials I need a minimum of another £800 (I will beg, borrow and steal wherever possible for everything else). For outside expertise I’ve budgeted £500 – and again, I’ll be pulling in a lot of favours.

At the same time, Phantom Power Films announced their intention to travel to Catalonia to interview people on the ground in the aftermath of their independence referendum. We believe that is an important project to support, so we pledged to swing the final 3 days of this crowdfunder - that is, monies donated past the original target - to this new emergency project.Every penny of the money donated towards the original target of £3,410 will go towards Scotland's Choice, as originally described below.Donations beyond this point (100% funded at 7.01pm 2nd November 2017) will be transferred to the Phantom Power Films project in Catalonia.The reason for the small change is simply the fast-moving events in Catalonia which we believe will have a strong political bearing on indyref2. We opted to forward the ""overflow"" from this fundraiser (after the 100% target was met) to this new worthy project. This was purely to save time and avoid delays in getting a film crew out to Catalonia.Any original funders who object to this, we will happily - and without question - refund their donations.  For further information or enquiries, please use the contact form on this website and we will respond as quickly as possible. Thank you.*** UPDATE ENDS ***We’ve come a long way since 2014. However you voted back then, or in the 2016 EU Referendum, the situation facing us today is completely different.The UK is leaving the EU. The Brent oil price has halved. We have a shambolic ideologically-driven UK government seemingly hell-bent on ‘hard Brexit’. Trump is in the White House. The SNP lost its Holyrood majority (though crucially not its mandate). Catalonia has voted for independence - so far denied by an increasingly fascist Spanish state.Some things haven’t changed. The newspapers are still full of politically-motivated drivel, and our state broadcaster only seems interested in mentioning Scotland if it plays badly for the SNP. The Tories are still pushing austerity and nonsense ""economics"", and the Scottish Labour party is having another leadership election. After the 2014 indyref, I went looking for answers to the unanswered question that still burned in my mind; how could Scotland, one of the most resource-rich and intellectually gifted countries in the world, not afford to be independent? Why do the GERS figures just make no sense?What I discovered on my journey was a far more complex story, a fabric of intertwined threads stretching back years and, in some cases, centuries, all bringing us to a nexus point in 2017. The story of how Scotland reached this point is incredibly rich, full of heroes and villains, high-powered politics and global economics. There are so many incredible pieces to the story, and they are being brought together now for the very first time.Meticulously researched and referenced, Scotland’s Choice explains - in plain language with minimal jargon - the political and economic forces that brought us to an inevitable choice between Britain and Europe. It lays out the options before us, demystifies Brexit, and unearths the crucial evidence missing from the Scottish Government’s 2013 White Paper. Perhaps most importantly, it completely destroys the so-called “economic case” for the union with England. What do we need?Time and money - as always! The book itself is about three-quarters written in an unedited state. The key pieces of research are all in place, but I need access to some more specialised texts which, because of their complexity and the small audience for them, cost a bit of money (hence the crowdfunder!). I also need to bring in some experts to proof-read and cross-check my work. Again, mostly it’s time that is the crucial resource rather than money.In terms of the money, I need to cover modest living expenses for 3 months – that’s £1,800. For the research materials I need a minimum of another £800 (I will beg, borrow and steal wherever possible for everything else). For outside expertise I’ve budgeted £500 – and again, I’ll be pulling in a lot of favours. Add on the 10% crowdfunding and PayPal/payment gateway fees brings us to a grand total of £3,410.What you getA whole new campaign resource! The complete book will be made freely available to everyone as a downloadable PDF.

<h2>it - IL FESTIVAL </h2>
<p>Il <strong>Caorle Independent Film Festival</strong>, ormai giunto alla sua <strong>quarta edizione</strong>, è un evento culturale che si tiene annualmente nella splendida città di <strong>Caorle</strong>, la piccola Venezia, e porta per alcuni giorni la magia del <strong>cinema indipendente </strong>tra le vie di un paese in cui non ci sono sale cinematografiche.</p>
<p>Il festival nasce dalla volontà dell'<strong>Associazione Culturale Caorle Film</strong> di valorizzare proprio quella nicchia di artisti che creano e producono le loro opere senza l'aiuto di una grande casa di produzione e che difficilmente vengono distribuite nelle sale: il cinema indipendente.</p>
<p>Il nostro evento culturale è ormai un punto di <strong>incontro fisso tra</strong> <strong>videomaker, autori, artisti ed esperti</strong> di questo settore provenienti da tutto il mondo.</p>
<p>Il Caorle Independent Film Festival (CIFF) è strutturato in modo da porre sempre al primo posto tutti i partecipanti in gara in un <strong>ambiente festivaliero dal sapore internazionale</strong>,  costruendo occasioni di confronto e scambio culturale uniche, oltre all'<strong>assegnazione di premi e riconoscimenti attribuiti da una giuria di esperti</strong>.</p>
<p>Anche gli stessi visitatori, oltre a poter <strong>assistere gratuitamente a tutte le proiezioni</strong>, diventano parte integrante del festival partecipando attivamente alle attività collaterali del festival: <strong>incontri con gli autori, panels e conferenze</strong> in cui porre domande e curiosità, oltre ad assistere ogni sera a <strong>concerti gratuiti</strong> che si svolgono nei locali partner della cittadina.</p>
<h2><i>en - THE FESTIVAL </i></h2>
<p><i>Now at its <strong>4th edition</strong>, the <strong>Caorle Independent Film Festival </strong>is a cultural event held annually in the beautiful <strong>city of Caorle</strong>, the little Venice (<strong>Italy</strong>), and brings for a few days the magic of <strong>independent cinema</strong> in the streets of a town without cinemas.</i></p>
<p><i>The festival was born out of the desire of the <strong>Caorle Film Cultural Association</strong> to promote that very niche of artists who create and produce their works without the help of a major production company, and who are rarely distributed in cinemas: the independent cinema.</i></p>
<p><i>Our cultural event has become <strong>a regular meeting for video makers, authors, artists and experts</strong> in this field coming from all over the world.</i></p>
<p><i>The Caorle Independent Film Festival (CIFF) is structured so as to always put all participants in the first place within a <strong>festive atmosphere of international flair</strong>. This creates unique opportunities for comparison and cultural exchange, along with the <strong>assignment of prizes and awards conferred by a jury of experts</strong>.<br/>The visitors are also given the opportunity to become an essential part of the festival: besides attending <strong>all the screenings for free</strong>, they actively participate in the festival's collateral activities, such as <strong>meetings with the authors, panels and conferences</strong> where they can ask questions and curiosities, as well as attending <strong>free concerts</strong> every evening in the town's partner venues.</i></p>

<p>Anche con un piccolo gesto potrai davvero fare la differenza: <strong>aiuterai in prima linea la diffusione della cultura e dell'unicità del cinema indipendente</strong>, che troppo spesso non riesce ad essere valorizzato adeguatamente e ad avere il giusto spazio di espressione.</p>
<p>Grazie al tuo preziosissimo sostegno, moltissimi artisti dell'audiovisivo potranno vivere un'esperienza unica e indimenticabile, aiutandoli ad essere valorizzati come meritano e a ricevere i riconoscimenti che gli spettano. </p>
<h2><i>en - HOW YOU CAN HELP US</i></h2>
<p><i>Every year, edition after edition, the running costs and the difficulty in finding sponsors increase proportionately to the growth of the cultural value of the event and its content. </i></p>
<p><br/><i><strong>The time is ripe to make a change</strong>. </i></p>
<p><i>Therefore, we, the organizers, have decided to turn to you and ask for <strong>a little help to make a big difference</strong>, so that we can organize an edition that will remain in everyone's hearts.</i></p>

<p><i>However, if you choose to help us through a contribution, we will be very happy to r<strong>eward you with unique festival gadgets and experiences</strong>!</i></p>
<p><i>Even with a small donation, you can really make a difference: <strong>you'll be helping to spread the culture and uniqueness of the independent cinema</strong>, which too often finds itself unable to be properly valued and to have the appropriate space for expression.</i></p>
<p><i>Thanks to your invaluable support, <strong>many audiovisual artists will be able to live a unique and unforgettable experience</strong>. You will help them to be valued as they are rightfully due and to receive the recognition they deserve. </i></p>

</div></div>","it - IL FESTIVAL 
Il Caorle Independent Film Festival, ormai giunto alla sua quarta edizione, è un evento culturale che si tiene annualmente nella splendida città di Caorle, la piccola Venezia, e porta per alcuni giorni la magia del cinema indipendente tra le vie di un paese in cui non ci sono sale cinematografiche.
Il festival nasce dalla volontà dell'Associazione Culturale Caorle Film di valorizzare proprio quella nicchia di artisti che creano e producono le loro opere senza l'aiuto di una grande casa di produzione e che difficilmente vengono distribuite nelle sale: il cinema indipendente.
Il nostro evento culturale è ormai un punto di incontro fisso tra videomaker, autori, artisti ed esperti di questo settore provenienti da tutto il mondo.
Il Caorle Independent Film Festival (CIFF) è strutturato in modo da porre sempre al primo posto tutti i partecipanti in gara in un ambiente festivaliero dal sapore internazionale,  costruendo occasioni di confronto e scambio culturale uniche, oltre all'assegnazione di premi e riconoscimenti attribuiti da una giuria di esperti.
Anche gli stessi visitatori, oltre a poter assistere gratuitamente a tutte le proiezioni, diventano parte integrante del festival partecipando attivamente alle attività collaterali del festival: incontri con gli autori, panels e conferenze in cui porre domande e curiosità, oltre ad assistere ogni sera a concerti gratuiti che si svolgono nei locali partner della cittadina.
en - THE FESTIVAL 
Now at its 4th edition, the Caorle Independent Film Festival is a cultural event held annually in the beautiful city of Caorle, the little Venice (Italy), and brings for a few days the magic of independent cinema in the streets of a town without cinemas.
The festival was born out of the desire of the Caorle Film Cultural Association to promote that very niche of artists who create and produce their works without the help of a major production company, and who are rarely distributed in cinemas: the independent cinema.
Our cultural event has become a regular meeting for video makers, authors, artists and experts in this field coming from all over the world.
The Caorle Independent Film Festival (CIFF) is structured so as to always put all participants in the first place within a festive atmosphere of international flair. This creates unique opportunities for comparison and cultural exchange, along with the assignment of prizes and awards conferred by a jury of experts.The visitors are also given the opportunity to become an essential part of the festival: besides attending all the screenings for free, they actively participate in the festival's collateral activities, such as meetings with the authors, panels and conferences where they can ask questions and curiosities, as well as attending free concerts every evening in the town's partner venues.

 
it - IN CHE MODO PUOI AIUTARCI
Ogni anno, edizione dopo edizione, i costi di gestione e la difficoltà nel trovare sponsor aumentano proporzionalmente alla crescita del valore culturale dell'evento e dei suoi contenuti. I tempi sono maturi per la svolta, pertanto noi organizzatori abbiamo pensato di rivolgerci a te e chiederti un piccolo aiuto per fare davvero la differenza, permettendoci cosi di organizzare un'edizione che possa rimanere nel cuore di tutti.

Siamo ben consapevoli che l'emergenza covid-19 abbia trascinato con se una crisi economica senza precedenti, quindi anche una semplice condivisione e diventare un follower delle nostre pagine social può fare la differenza.
Se invece sceglierai di aiutarci attraverso un contributo, saremo felicissimi di ricompensarti con dei gadget e delle esperienze uniche del festival!
Anche con un piccolo gesto potrai davvero fare la differenza: aiuterai in prima linea la diffusione della cultura e dell'unicità del cinema indipendente, che troppo spesso non riesce ad essere valorizzato adeguatamente e ad avere il giusto spazio di espressione.
Grazie al tuo preziosissimo sostegno, moltissimi artisti dell'audiovisivo potranno vivere un'esperienza unica e indimenticabile, aiutandoli ad essere valorizzati come meritano e a ricevere i riconoscimenti che gli spettano. 
en - HOW YOU CAN HELP US
Every year, edition after edition, the running costs and the difficulty in finding sponsors increase proportionately to the growth of the cultural value of the event and its content. 
The time is ripe to make a change. 
Therefore, we, the organizers, have decided to turn to you and ask for a little help to make a big difference, so that we can organize an edition that will remain in everyone's hearts.
We are fully aware that the covid-19 emergency has caused an unprecedented economic crisis. Thus, even sharing on social media and becoming a follower of our social pages can make a great difference.
However, if you choose to help us through a contribution, we will be very happy to reward you with unique festival gadgets and experiences!
Even with a small donation, you can really make a difference: you'll be helping to spread the culture and uniqueness of the independent cinema, which too often finds itself unable to be properly valued and to have the appropriate space for expression.

 will go to projects to support the preservation of Miami Marine Stadium, 
including our initial project to remove and re-purpose the stadium’s 
seats. Fifteen percent will go to support the National Trust for Historic 
Preservation for our ongoing work to restore the stadium and other 
threatened historic sites around the country. Up to eight percent will cover Indiegogo costs and processing fees as described in Indiegogo’s <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/about/terms"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Terms and Conditions</a>.

<p><b>Why can’t I get a stadium seat if I live outside of Miami-Dade, Broward, or West Palm Beach counties?</b><br/></p>
<p>We’re
 working with a local delivery company and find it isn't feasible to ship the chairs outside this delivery area. We will refund donations for anyone who selects the
 seats but does not live in these counties, unless you can provide us 
with a local shipping address. 
</p>
<p><b>Tell me more about the graffiti prints.</b> </p>
<p>These
 photos were taken in 2014 at a series of National Trust sponsored 
events designed to bring attention to both the plight of the stadium and
 the rich culture of street art that has helped keep it alive. We’re 
happy to share these unique photos with campaign backers who are 
passionate about the restoration of the stadium. </p>
<p><b>Can I pick which graffiti print I receive?</b> </p>
<p>Different
 prints will be offered at different times during our Indiegogo 
campaign. It will be clear which print is available and when. Keep an 
eye on our campaign so that you can collect all three! </p>

<p>Tickets
 will be issued electronically at the end of our campaign to the 
email address connected with your Indiegogo account. <br/></p>

 perks will be mailed in October at the conclusion of our campaign 
except for donation badges and concert tickets. Donation badges will be 
sent electronically to the email address connected with your Indiegogo

 sent electronically to the email address connected with your Indiegogo 
account at the conclusion of our campaign. The concert will be held in 
September.<br/><br/><p><b>Can I visit the stadium?  </b></p>
<p>Sadly, the 
answer is no. The stadium has been closed to the general public since 
Hurricane Andrew and remains completely off limits today for safety 
reasons. The site is monitored by security guards 24/7, so don’t chance 
it! </p>
<p><b>When will the stadium’s renovation be complete? </b></p>
<p>Saving
 places takes time! With your support, though, a critical first step in 
the process—removing the seats—will happen soon. Recently, the City of 
Miami committed $4 million in funding for other important restoration 
projects at the stadium. They also hired an architect to guide 
the transformation. This is all part of their comprehensive plan to 
bring the stadium back to its former glory. </p>
<p><b>What about the graffiti? Will it be removed when the stadium is restored?</b> <br/></p>
<p>Our
 recommendation is that the restoration plan should definitely take into
 account the murals and graffiti, which are an undeniable part of the 
stadium’s story. Our hope is that the culture of street art is somehow 
incorporated in the renovated stadium.  
</p>
<p><b>Is the National Trust involved in other restoration projects?</b><br/></p>
<p>Yes!

1963: Miami Marine Stadium opens its doors. Its 326-foot roof was—at the time—the longest span of cantilevered concrete in the world.

1967: Miami Marine Stadium features in Elvis Presley film ""Clambake.” 

1972: Richard Nixon holds a campaign rally at Miami Marine Stadium where Sammy Davis Jr. infamously hugs him.

1985: Jimmy Buffett brings Margaritaville to MIA for a raucous, two-night concert that ends with him plunging into the water.

1990: The final boat race is held at Miami Marine Stadium after years of hosting world-class events that drew thousands.

1992: Hurricane Andrew hits land and shutters the stadium.

2009: The National Trust declares Miami Marine Stadium—vacant for decades—as one of America’s most endangered historic places.

2012: The National Trust names Miami Marine Stadium a National Treasure. We’re in it for the long haul to help save this amazing place.

2013: The City of Miami approves a comprehensive plan to restore Miami Marine Stadium as an entertainment venue, as it was in its heyday. The National Trust makes a grant to begin critical engineering studies.

2014: The Miami International Boat Show—the largest boat show in the world—announces that it will relocate to the stadium site for its 2016 event. Finally, the boats are back!

2016: Miami Mayor Tomás Regalado makes news by awarding as much as $4 million dollars in city funds to help restore Miami Marine Stadium. Soon after, the National Trust and Heineken join forces to raise even more.











Where is my donation going?More than 75% of all funds raised
 will go to projects to support the preservation of Miami Marine Stadium, 
including our initial project to remove and re-purpose the stadium’s 
seats. Fifteen percent will go to support the National Trust for Historic 
Preservation for our ongoing work to restore the stadium and other 
threatened historic sites around the country. Up to eight percent will cover Indiegogo costs and processing fees as described in Indiegogo’s Terms and Conditions.  

Why can’t I get a stadium seat if I live outside of Miami-Dade, Broward, or West Palm Beach counties?
We’re
 working with a local delivery company and find it isn't feasible to ship the chairs outside this delivery area. We will refund donations for anyone who selects the
 seats but does not live in these counties, unless you can provide us 
with a local shipping address. 

Tell me more about the graffiti prints. 
These
 photos were taken in 2014 at a series of National Trust sponsored 
events designed to bring attention to both the plight of the stadium and
 the rich culture of street art that has helped keep it alive. We’re 
happy to share these unique photos with campaign backers who are 
passionate about the restoration of the stadium. 
Can I pick which graffiti print I receive? 
Different
 prints will be offered at different times during our Indiegogo 
campaign. It will be clear which print is available and when. Keep an 
eye on our campaign so that you can collect all three! 
How will I get tickets to the finale concert? 
Tickets
 will be issued electronically at the end of our campaign to the 
email address connected with your Indiegogo account. 


Live Nation Worldwide, Inc. is
not a sponsor of the ticket offer, and is in no way responsible for the
administration of the ticket offer, the verification of qualified consumers or
fulfillment of tickets.  All inquiries regarding the ticket offer should
be directed to Heineken USA and not to Live Nation Worldwide, Inc. 
Tickets available while supplies last. 
When will I get my perk?All
 perks will be mailed in October at the conclusion of our campaign 
except for donation badges and concert tickets. Donation badges will be 
sent electronically to the email address connected with your Indiegogo 
account within seven days of your donation. Concert tickets will also be
 sent electronically to the email address connected with your Indiegogo 
account at the conclusion of our campaign. The concert will be held in 
September.Can I visit the stadium?  
Sadly, the 
answer is no. The stadium has been closed to the general public since 
Hurricane Andrew and remains completely off limits today for safety 
reasons. The site is monitored by security guards 24/7, so don’t chance 
it! 
When will the stadium’s renovation be complete? 
Saving
 places takes time! With your support, though, a critical first step in 
the process—removing the seats—will happen soon. Recently, the City of 
Miami committed $4 million in funding for other important restoration 
projects at the stadium. They also hired an architect to guide 
the transformation. This is all part of their comprehensive plan to 
bring the stadium back to its former glory. 
What about the graffiti? Will it be removed when the stadium is restored? 
Our
 recommendation is that the restoration plan should definitely take into
 account the murals and graffiti, which are an undeniable part of the 
stadium’s story. Our hope is that the culture of street art is somehow 
incorporated in the renovated stadium.  

Is the National Trust involved in other restoration projects?
Yes!
 We’re the country’s leading advocate for saving historic places, and as
 such, we’re on the ground in communities across the nation. Visit our 
website to explore other National Treasures like Miami Marine Stadium.",20.0,0,"13 Campaigns

<p>LoveFest is a collaborative experimental arts festival. The event uses the medium of ‘festival’ to create new ways of being and producing together. The festival aims to produce radical rethinking on the concept of Love through events where non-form is the form.</p>
<p>The inaugural LoveFest was held in 2017 which we put together without external funding, relying solely on the generosity of local and international artists. This year, we have the goal to financially compensate the wonderful artists and creatives who make LoveFest. </p>
<p>With this campaign we are raising money for resources to put on the shows including promotion and infrastructure, production costs of the publication, and paying contributing artists who are developing original work for the events. </p>
<p>Love Fest 2018 will be held in Budapest, Hungary from May 11-13. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are trying to raise a modest amount of money to compensate artists for their time and work. It is still important to us to financially appreciate artists’ work, even if this amount just a token contribution. We hold this goal strongly this year when many in our creative community are living precariously. The more money we collect through this campaign the more we are able to pay contributors. Contributing to the campaign also keeps the LoveFest events free of charge.</p>
<p>The more money we collect the more we are able to pay contributors! </p>
<p>In exchange for your donation, we have a bunch of great love fest merchandise. Most importantly the Lovefest2018 Publication. This anthology is created from artists, writers and thinkers all over the world who responded to our open call.  Last year the limited first edition copy sold out in two hours.  Contribute to the campaign to day to secure your publication now.</p>
<p>If you want more detail about our budget, you can contact us and we will happily share it with you. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The money that we raise helps us put on the festival, it keeps it free for guests and it helps to compensate artists for their work. </p>
<p>Last year, we put on the festival with no outside funding. Our friends and others were generous enough to contribute their work and time to help us make LoveFest happen. This year, we would like to be able to support the contributors to the festival with some financial support and this is why we are making this campaign!</p>
<p>Each happening of Lovefest is created through a process of collaboration based in queer feminist principles. The aesthetic of LoveFest pulls from pulls from our everyday realities. It pays homage to our modes of communication and community while interrogating our relationship to these banal activities and habits.</p>
<p>LoveFest 2017 played with themes of collaboration, communication, cyber reality and celebration. LoveFest 2018 is taking you to the city. LoveFest provides alternative ways of being together. As much as we can, we try to keep it outside of an established structure and we have a strong focus on collective working practices. </p>

<h3>A Moment that Changed the Prism of Female Sports</h3>

<h3><strong>About us: </strong></h3>
<p>The Mostar Street Arts Festival has been continuously held for the past 6 years. The festival is a part of a positive social movement in Mostar, always evolving to include a more diverse artistic program.</p>
<p>It also provides an open space for up and coming young artists from B&amp;H to hone in their craft and go public with their work. Because of this, Mostar has become one of the largest open-air galleries in Bosnia and Herzegovina and even the region. More than 100 murals have been painted in Mostar by artists from Bosnia and Herzegovina, the region and abroad, most of which were funded by the Street Arts Festival.</p>
<p>The month long festival this upcoming June is not only about artists painting murals across the city, but it also includes events such as concerts and DJ nights featuring talented local musicians, workshops and exhibitions. During the festival, there is truly something for everyone and all ages. Pop-up events occur as interest gains and citizens of Mostar realize their own creative skills and talents they have to offer. We have an official schedule, but events often form organically, usually at a low cost using communal spaces in the city and collaborations between formal and informal organizations.  </p>
<p>Our most ambitious venture began last year when we began to transform the ruined military complex into a open air gallery and event space. The Konak Barracks are now the <i>Konak Art District,</i> which is now operational as our main event space. We plan to expand the utility of the space this year to include more performances, an open air cinema, and an urban garden.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520593403/l0khnj229y23bhqubbgh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3><strong>History of Mostar:</strong></h3>
<p>Mostar has always been a beautiful city, with architectural attractions such as a picturesque 16th century Ottoman bridge and both Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian style neighborhoods. However, during the Bosnian war in the mid 90’s, much of the city was destroyed and required rebuilding, the community is still healing, architecturally, politically, economically and emotionally. Although much of Mostar has been rebuilt, there is still a push to repair ruins and wartime destruction throughout the city.</p>
<p>Rebuilding is an expensive and often disappointing endeavor due to rampant corruption and money fraud. The SAF aims to repair the city in a different way, by transforming buildings and ruins through street art. All the while, engaging young artists to collaborate across the political divides of the city and use art as a unifier.</p>

<h3><strong>Why contribute?</strong></h3>
<p>We are asking for funding to help this year’s Street Arts Festival come into fruition. Our main costs come from paint and other artistic supplies needed to create at least 5 large scale murals and 15 smaller murals.  We must take on all the costs for expensive rentals such as scaffolding equipment for artists. We also must provide accommodation and transportation for regional and international artists. As interest grows in the festival, the higher our expenses rise as we wish to include as many artists as possible in the festival.</p>
<p>Even if we don’t achieve our fundraising goal, you can be assured that every dollar contributed will go towards the festival and every bit makes and huge difference in making this special event happen.</p>

Showcase mother makers internationally. Central to Mother Makers is collaboration.  It is our plan to bring a selection of mother makers to Munich Jewellery Week 2018. We have secured a venue with the help of Munich Aritsts which is right in the city centre at Odeonsplatz and very soon we will launch a callout for participants. This curated exhibition will showcase a wide selection of work from mothers that focus on this life transforming experience, demonstrating that procreation does not mean the end of one's career, or inspiration. 
Develop and add content to our website. To provide more support, advice and examples of best practice for maker-mums online, enabling other mothers to work through our research, to network and to establish a presence within art and design as valid professionals. 
Develop and explore best practices in combined studio and childcare formats We are aware that many mothers often feel isolated and struggle to find support systems to enable them to have dedicated time in the studio. We aim  to research and test combined studio and childcare formats to provide a blueprint to others who are struggling to find ways to create while caring for their children.   How will we use the money we receive?We have set a target of €7000 for this campaign. This money will be spend on these specific funding requirements: Our travel and accommodation (babies and all) to Munich, exhibition and display costs. To go towards the costs of managing and organising a curated group exhibition in Munich. To enable us to continue to develop content for the Mother Makers website as well as to promote Mother Makers projects in the build up to and during Munich Jewellery Week. Help towards Mother Makers first planned trial of a  combined studio and childcare residency between Laura and Laurie planned for February 2018. We have been donated a space to work in and free accommodation and just need a little funding towards the costs of travel for this. The cost of the production of all the perks/ rewards. The Mother Makers making plans for the future What we have acheived to date:
We have been working really hard and have achieved a lot so far without any funding.
We have secured a venue in Munich for a Mother Makers curated exhibition during Munich Jewellery Week.
We have already begun to work with artist mothers. We have developed a website which features many interviews, advice and tips.
We have begun to explore different studio and residency options that will enable mothers to work while still caring for their child/ren.

<p style=""margin-left:5.0pt;""><strong>WHAT IS SPARK CONTEMPORARY ART SPACE</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:5.0pt;"">Spark Contemporary Art Space is one of Syracuse’s longest standing community-based art centers, operating for the past 20 years. Traditionally, the multi-room, street level commercial venue was operated as a ""DIY"" space rental, acting as a home base for a large group of artists from all backgrounds and mediums: photographers, directors, musicians, cinematographers, illustrators, dancers, producers, inventors, writers, performers, editors, designers, and more.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5.0pt;"">Under new ownership, the vision is to respect the grassroots, organic history and the affordable, amorphous use the space has provided Syracuse-area creatives, while simultaneously working to transform SPARK into a full-time live music venue, art gallery, used book store, cafe/lounge and movement/yoga/dance space. It also has sites on producing other SPARK branded events.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5.0pt;"">This crowd fund campaign aims to ""Spark The Arts,"" embracing cooperative values, building regional partnerships, supporting our surrounding neighborhood and offering a ""DIO"" (Do It Ourselves) mentality. Located in fast developing downtown / university neighborhood, SPARK is primed to serve a larger youth market hungry for a local hub, funky culture and lively outings.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5.0pt;"">You as a contributor will help build an affordable, inclusive venue that will encourage students, artists and patrons alike to unite under one roof. SPARK is perfectly triangulated between college lifestyle, urban housing and other creative neighborhoods in Syracuse. All these groups and more should feel welcomed into a space where they can perform, create and even simply kick up their feet, read a book and sip some coffee. Every little bit you provide brings Syracuse closer to creative community, using SPARK as the intersection between all artistic paths.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5.0pt;"">One of the most exciting elements is the effort to bring a coffee chop element into the space! Discussions are in the works to fully activate this element of SPARK by Spring 2018 .</p>
<p style=""margin-left:5.0pt;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:5.0pt;""><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:5.0pt;"">Since the summer of 2017, SPARK has been co-owned by Patrick Tuohey and Jacob Roberts.

Spark Contemporary Art Space is one of Syracuse’s longest standing community-based art centers, operating for the past 20 years. Traditionally, the multi-room, street level commercial venue was operated as a ""DIY"" space rental, acting as a home base for a large group of artists from all backgrounds and mediums: photographers, directors, musicians, cinematographers, illustrators, dancers, producers, inventors, writers, performers, editors, designers, and more.
Under new ownership, the vision is to respect the grassroots, organic history and the affordable, amorphous use the space has provided Syracuse-area creatives, while simultaneously working to transform SPARK into a full-time live music venue, art gallery, used book store, cafe/lounge and movement/yoga/dance space. It also has sites on producing other SPARK branded events.
This crowd fund campaign aims to ""Spark The Arts,"" embracing cooperative values, building regional partnerships, supporting our surrounding neighborhood and offering a ""DIO"" (Do It Ourselves) mentality. Located in fast developing downtown / university neighborhood, SPARK is primed to serve a larger youth market hungry for a local hub, funky culture and lively outings.
You as a contributor will help build an affordable, inclusive venue that will encourage students, artists and patrons alike to unite under one roof. SPARK is perfectly triangulated between college lifestyle, urban housing and other creative neighborhoods in Syracuse. All these groups and more should feel welcomed into a space where they can perform, create and even simply kick up their feet, read a book and sip some coffee. Every little bit you provide brings Syracuse closer to creative community, using SPARK as the intersection between all artistic paths.
One of the most exciting elements is the effort to bring a coffee chop element into the space! Discussions are in the works to fully activate this element of SPARK by Spring 2018 .
 
WHO WE ARE
Since the summer of 2017, SPARK has been co-owned by Patrick Tuohey and Jacob Roberts. Patrick, a seasoned talent buyer, promoter and musician, and Jacob, an artist, business owner and property developer both have a desire for SPARK maintain its avant-garde art gallery vibe, hosting art exhibits, film /video, poetry, dance and other arts endeavors, while also becoming the premiere, small capacity sound stage in Syracuse, NY, hosting regional and national acts.
Jacob and Patrick are anything but new to the local art and music community. Back in the late 90’s, early 2000's, Jacob worked as a professional artist and designer in downtown, while acting as the Executive Director of ThINC, The Institution of a Now Culture, Inc. an enterprising 501c3 that activated the local, street-level, art scene, while also revitalizing many dormant commercial properties. Jacob was also instrumental in launching 40Below, a successful young professionals organization, was a founding member of the Arts and Culture Leadership Council of Onondaga County (ACLA), was briefly involved in local politics, and has recently launched a new venture called Crystal City Creative Spaces, an “Art Space”  real estate investment cooperative, as a way to continue the legacy of groups like ThINC and 40Below, and awesome places like SPARK, that have contributed to making Syracuse a fun, exciting, vibrant and creative city.

Likewise, Patrick has been a crucial part of enriching area venues and the artists that play them for years.

Pursuing a Bachelor's in Music Business from Berklee Boston (#1 Independent school of music in the world), working for Soundgarden Syracuse (one of only a few independent record stores left in the area) and operating a small web development and graphic design firm called Phantom Pain Media, catering specifically to artists and musicians are just a few of the other projects that places Patrick in the right place to lead an initiative like SPARK The Arts, which depends so closely on a connection with the community.

<p>The Festival is organised by local residents – all volunteers.  On the day itself, dozens of people get involved to make it happen.  The Festival brings people together, celebrates local talent and provides a fantastic day for all – with a climbing wall, children’s activities, music, stalls, food, street entertainment - and thousands of people.   The fact that it is a free event is crucial – we want everyone to be able to come along.   It costs around £7000 to organise – to pay for the stage, PA equipment, public liability insurance, music licensing, climbing wall, First Aid, posters, leaflets, street entertainers and performers.  We are able to raise about £1000 through stalls, and get a small ‘Lets Get The Party Started’ grant from Newham Council.  Two local housing associations make a donation and we raise a bit of money from local businesses.  This crowdfunding campaign is crucial – without these donations, the Festival cannot happen in 2017.</p>

<h3>Slam with us!</h3>
<p>Hi! Do you know what <strong>Poetry Slam</strong> is?<br/>If you're here, you probably already know, or you know someone who knows it, so we won't bother you with details about this art form (if you're new to it, go and enjoy it on youtube, you won't regret it!).</p>
<p>We are LIPS, the italian poetry slam league, and <strong>we're hosting this year's european championship finals in Milan</strong>. The event will take place on <strong>march 19-20-21</strong>, it will be hosted <strong>in a marvelous venue</strong> (<a href=""https://base.milano.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BASE Milano</a> is a huge and lovely area where concerts, theater, exibitions, book-fairs and other kinds of events fit perfectly) and we're planning to have <strong>an entire week of gigs and performances</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>For the first time ever</strong>, the championship will see <strong>30 poets</strong> from all around Europe compete for the title, and a lot of italian volunteers are already working in order to make this experience extraordinary for everyone involved.</p>

<h3>We're creating a book</h3>

<p>The book will contain the best poem (in english and italian) from every slammer participating in the competition, it will have a literary compendium about languages and translations, but the real killing feature is that <strong>Martina Dirce Carcano</strong> (MDC Illustration) <strong>will illustrate the introduction page for every poet</strong>, giving an artistic touch to the anthology.</p>
<p>We want to make everyone <strong>feel our warm italian welcome</strong>, so we'll donate to each participant a bag with her or his copy of the book. You can have it too by contributing to the campaign. Feel free to chose among perks and <strong>spread the word</strong> if you think you know somebody who could be interested (or just do it in order to be sure that your favourite slammer won't have to WALK to Italy).</p>

<p><strong>The best way to enjoy a poetry slam is to participate live</strong>, so feel free to go on our site and find all the details about the events, <strong>we'll be happy to hug you</strong>!</p>

This trans-boundary and multicultural project recognizes culture as a powerful tool for social change and acknowledges expressive arts having the ability to reach people with various mindsets, attitudes and experiences. In 2016 the project involved about 200 youth from 6 orphanages and centres and 50 East-African artists from Kenya and Tanzania.</p><p>As there is no confirmed funding for 2017 this campaign is collecting the needed funds to carry through similar youth projects in various locations in November-December 2017. Through these projects the youth are exposed to various art forms and guided through a creative process that will develop their confidence and self-expression as well as social skills and team working. The goal is to include 15 artists and about 100 youth in 4 locations in both Tanzania and Kenya. </p><p>For the youth participants, most coming from socio-economically challenged backgrounds these type of projects are creating meaningful experiences helping them to grow to responsible and active citizens.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>To make PAYA 2017 happen in the best way possible we are in need of 8 000 USD. This will be used for carrying out youth several projects in Tanzania and Kenya and organising PAYA FEST 2017 in Arusha, Tanzania to showcase the work of the projects. The funds will be used for:</p><ol>
<li>Materials for creating the performances, e.g. costumes and props (400$)</li>

This trans-boundary and multicultural project recognizes culture as a powerful tool for social change and acknowledges expressive arts having the ability to reach people with various mindsets, attitudes and experiences. In 2016 the project involved about 200 youth from 6 orphanages and centres and 50 East-African artists from Kenya and Tanzania.As there is no confirmed funding for 2017 this campaign is collecting the needed funds to carry through similar youth projects in various locations in November-December 2017. Through these projects the youth are exposed to various art forms and guided through a creative process that will develop their confidence and self-expression as well as social skills and team working. The goal is to include 15 artists and about 100 youth in 4 locations in both Tanzania and Kenya. For the youth participants, most coming from socio-economically challenged backgrounds these type of projects are creating meaningful experiences helping them to grow to responsible and active citizens. What We Need & What You GetTo make PAYA 2017 happen in the best way possible we are in need of 8 000 USD. This will be used for carrying out youth several projects in Tanzania and Kenya and organising PAYA FEST 2017 in Arusha, Tanzania to showcase the work of the projects. The funds will be used for:
Materials for creating the performances, e.g. costumes and props (400$)
Food & Accomodation for approximately 100 youth during project and final festival (1300$)
Communication & Documentation, e.g. producing documentaries and video material for each youth project and printing t-shirts for participants (2100$)
Per Diems to cover food and accommodation during project for approximately 15 young artists volunteering their expertice (2000$)

Our Story

The Rogers Experimental House was born on the bricks of Rogers, Arkansas, the second week of June 2016 during a chance meeting and sidewalk conversation between founding board members Dayton Castleman, a Rogers-based artist and museum professional, Jessica Hester, a Rogers-based architect, and Karen Wagaman, downtown development VP at the Rogers-Lowell Chamber of Commerce. The consensus was that downtown Rogers would make an ideal home for a space driven by making, and by facilitating the growth of innovative ideas - a place where art, and technology, and learning, and skill-building could thrive and become a creative resource to the community. 
Conversations about just what form that making space might take continued for the next several months, including public forums to begin building a community of partners and collaborators, shaped by Dayton's and Jessica's involvement in the founding and operation of artist-run and maker-run spaces in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Rome, Georgia. That summer we added board members Morgan Hooker, a local real-estate developer, and David Vaden, an accountant, and by the fall of 2016 we had incorporated and begun the process of applying for non-profit status, receiving our 501(c)(3) in December of 2016. 
2017 came with the potential to test drive the Rogers Experimental House in a temporary home with a wonderful address. The Elks Lodge at 121 W Walnut sits in the heart of downtown Rogers, steps from Arkansas Public Theatre, the Rogers Historical Museum, and Rogers' growing mix of eateries, breweries, and unique shopping. By April we had secured the opportunity to create a pop-up creative space on the ground floor of the building, as an incubator and community-building pilot for the future Rogers Experimental House.

What the House needs.
Like any ""new"" house, we need a few things to keep us running and facilitate the creative work we want to support.

What a treasure trove! The collections are both varied and deep. The materials are meticulously cared for, and most carefully organized. Anyone who uses the Louise Lawrence Transgender Archive will be pleasantly and continuously delighted. Even more so if you have the opportunity to benefit from Ms. Bob’s vast knowledge of the field.– Aaron Devor, PhD, Chair in Transgender Studies, Founder and Academic Director, The Transgender Archives, University of Victoria, BCMs. Bob Davis is a life-long collector of transgender print media and ephemera. The depth and breadth of the material is astonishing, ranging from autographed books to support group newsletters to slick magazines to rare publicity shots from the turn of the XX century onward to mid-XXth century Parisian night club programs. Ms. Bob knows every piece intimately. Even better, she has become an expert at deciphering and finding meaning in early material. She and her library are treasures and must be protected at all costs.– Dallas Denny, MA, Founder, National Transgender Library & Archive, housed in the Labadie Collection, University of Michigan, Ann ArborLEFT: Holiday card from Virginia Prince to the members of Phi Pi Epsilon (Foundation or Personal Expression) and Transvestia subscribers.

RIGHT: Cover of Ladylike Magazine 1992 with “Tippi” as Princess Angel (left) and Miss X as Queen Veneer from the cult film “Vegas in Space.”A Message from Ms. Bob DavisFounder and director of Louise Lawrence Transgender ArchiveFor over 35 years I have been fascinated by the history of my trans community, the people who formed it and those who preceded it.  The first transgender magazine I bought was the premiere issue of Female Mimics International in 1979.  By the early 1990s I had accumulated a rich trove of transgender history, information that many in the community wanted to see.  I began to share the archive by writing history columns for trans community publications such as Lady Like, Transgender Community News and Transgender Tapestry.  Many of these articles are available at the Transgender Forum archive www.tgforum.com.  I have presented lectures on trans history at conferences such as the 2nd International Congress on Crossdressing, Sex and Gender, California Dreamin’, and Fantasia Fair (2014). By 2000, scholars of transgender history had begun requesting access to my archive because of its depth and the rarity of its holdings.The LOUISE LAWRENCE TRANSGENDER ARCHIVE is the next logical step, a community-based institution that will make this important collection available to scholars and the public.  The history of marginalized communities is elusive, imperiled and best preserved by the community itself.  The LLTA will preserve transgender history and encourage its study.-----------------------------------Ms. BOB DAVIS, LLTA founder & director, served two terms on the board of GLBT Historical Society, one as secretary.  She presented her lecture, “Do the Clothes Fit? - Searching for Trans Identity in Archival Images of Cross-dressing,” at Moving Trans History Forward, the world’s first academic conference on transgender history (2014), at the University of Victoria, BC.  Ms. Bob delivered the opening keynote at the 40th annual Fantasia Fair (2015), the world’s longest running, annual transgender event.  Her article, “Using Archives to Identify the Trans* Women of Casa Susanna,” appeared in Transgender Studies Quarterly’s “Archives & Archiving” issue (2015), Duke University Press.  She teaches music at City College of San Francisco.The collection of archival materials that Ms. Bob has amassed is truly extraordinary––it stretches back long before “transgender” even existed and it thoroughly documents the emergence of what we now understand to be transgender community. Ms. Bob’s lifetime of community engagement, activism, and leadership provides an unparalleled knowledge base for this collection. Any researcher who is able to work with this collection would be in for a real treat!-- K.J.

Her vast personal collection is full or rarities; it is of great historical value and will be a boon to researchers, but just as importantly, it’s also a playground for anybody with a curious and open mind. It’s a treat simply to paw through boxes and shelves full of archival materials that document, in exquisite detail, that gender is a whole lot more complicated than most people ever suspect.– Susan Stryker, Ph.D., author of Transgender History, Director of the Institute for LGBT Studies, University of Arizona Ms Bob is a fascinating human being who has created a deep and fascinating archive of transgender material that includes the kind of ephemera that makes history come alive. The Louise Lawrence Transgender Archive will be a treasure trove of information that scholars will love. This unique archive offers access to material not found elsewhere and cataloged intelligently. You may also have the privilege of discussing the material with Ms. Bob for further insight.– Mariette Pathy Allen, M.F.A., photographer, writer, speaker, author of TransCuba and ally of the transgender community since 1978 The Louise Lawrence Transgender Archive will be an amazing and much needed resource for the transgender community and scholars alike. Ms. Bob Davis has assembled a formidable collection of publications and other artifacts from past (and largely forgotten) eras of trans history. Preserving this collection, and making it accessible to the public, is a laudable goal!– Julia Serano, author of Whipping Girl: A Transsexual Woman on Sexism and the Scapegoating of Femininity I first got to know Ms. Bob while working on a trans history display for the GLBT Historical Society in San Francisco. While we worked on the curation of the display, I discovered her passion for history, as well as her keen eye for culturally significant items. This is one person, and one project, I would strongly recommend pursuing. I cannot think of any one person who I would turn to more when it comes to a true archive of important transgender materials like this.– Gwen Smith, transgender activist and author of syndicated column “Transmissions” The Louise Lawrence Transgender Archive is absolutely critical for our Transgender/Trans/Genderqueer/Non-Binary Histories. As we know, marginalized people’s lives and stories are often erased – and once gone, it is nearly impossible to fight against dominant voices saying we have never existed. Ms. Bob Davis’s curating, collecting, preserving, and housing of the Louise Lawrence Transgender Archive needs to be fully supported. I have been amazed by Ms. Bob Davis’s collection and think that we must all support her endeavor to make this archive fully accessible in a place where students and researchers have the ability to to work with them so that we can all continue to uncover the stories of our lives.

<p><strong><i>English here:</i></strong></p>
<p>I'm Charles, though my Leòdhasach family and friends know me as Teàrlach, even in English! I'm part Leòdhasach, part Glaswegian, and part Welsh! In 2016, my Welsh mum, Margaret Wilson, founded Tolgate Coffee in Strood, Kent. It had always been a dream of hers to have a sophisticated coffee shop with the heart of the community at its centre. After hard work and dedication, with some help from family and friends, she now owns one of the nicest coffee shops, with some of the best food and drink, in Kent.  Now, expanding on Tolgate, I have joined the team to make Tolgate Coffee a national, family-run business, offering a unique side to coffee shops: local culture. There's plenty to choose from in the UK, but the Outer Hebrides of Scotland have some of the oldest, most traditional ways of life in Europe. Tolgate Coffee is going to use its Kent branch as a foundation for its daughter branches, but each will have their own unique take on the local culture of their locations. </p>
<p>And so, An Taigh Cèilidh was born.</p>
<p>When I lived in Italy and Poland, I had a genuinely immersive experience in the cultures and languages. This made my languages progress. When I did my PhD in Gaelic, I found that not only were there few (if any) immersive experiences for learners, there were few public spaces for more fluent and native speakers. I was particularly surprised to find no dedicated Gaelic spaces in Stornoway - the so-called ""Capital of the Western Isles"" - and the Western Isles being the so-called ""Traditional Gaelic Heartland"". Now that I teach Gaelic, students often ask for recommendations for immersive experiences. This is where Gaelic differs fundamentally from, say, Italian. And, living in Stornoway, my guests often ask me where they can experience local culture. As a Leòdhasach ùr ('New Lewisperson'), I am also concerned about the stability of the local culture, and I truly believe (as do organisations such as Bòrd na Gàidhlig, University of the Highlands and Islands, Visit the Outer Hebrides, and the Scottish Government) that Gaelic is not just of cultural value to Scotland, but also of genuine economic value. </p>
<p>So, An Taigh Cèilidh will provide the immersive experience for learners, the social space for speakers, the flavour of the island to visitors, and the economic support to Gaelic arts and traditional industries. The space we intend to buy is on Cromwell Street in the heart of Stornoway, next door to the old Town Hall, the Stornoway Historical Society, and the Story of Harris Tweed exhibition. We are close to the ferry pier, the bus station, free and paid parking, An Lanntair arts centre, and most town centre accommodation. We will be on the pedestrianised section of Cromwell Street, which will allow us to open up onto the street, which will make Stornoway particularly lively on a good day! Therefore, we will be normalising Gaelic that can be used as an everyday language in public spaces, just as you'd find, say, Polish in Poland.</p>
<p>All staff will be Gaelic-speaking, and every interaction will start in Gaelic. We will host events and performances in Gaelic, such as talks about local history, singing, poetry recital, book readings, and traditional music. We will house Gaelic social clubs, such as a Gaelic book club for adults, a Gaelic book club for children, a Gaelic club for parents with children in Gaelic schools, a Gaelic knitting club, and a Gaelic dog club. We will have a daily conversation circle for Gaelic learners, and Gaelic-medium lessons for things such as art and French.</p>
<p>We will sell Gaelic books, Gaelic greetings cards, Gaelic post cards, Gaelic CDs, and Gaelic DVDs. We will sell gift items, such as soap, candles, tweed items, art, photos, frames, and cups - made by Gaelic speakers and all labelled in Gaelic. This will be good for gift ideas, souvenirs, and supporting Gaelic talent and economy. Some of our profits will go into developing a Gaelic Scrabble and a Gaelic Monopoly board games. The in-house coffee shop will use local products from the island where possible (e.g. Stornoway black pudding), with our baristas trained to make truly artisan coffees. There will be no plastic in the hub, and part of our mission is to highlight and educate on environmental issues, especially those affecting the Outer Hebrides. The walls of the hub will be used as space to showcase gift items (especially art and photography), as well as an exhibition space (especially educational exhibits, such as environmental issues).</p>
<p>As well as ethical pay initiatives to support our staff and suppliers, we will also invest in mentorship and internship programmes. We will support our suppliers in taking on mentees to help people - especially young people - to train in arts and traditional industries, such as Tweed making. We will invest in internships in the centre to help learners and young people to develop business skills that will help with a Gaelic and island economy. If the hub does well, this model can be replicated elsewhere, and our interns can go off to develop the other hubs, or develop their projects and ideas.</p>
<p>An Taigh Cèilidh will be a Gaelic-focused cultural centre with events and performances in Gaelic, gift items made by Gaelic speakers and labelled in Gaelic, housing Gaelic social activities. We will be investing in Gaelic speakers and the island economy. Above all, it will appeal to everyone, whether they are  a native speaker or have no Gaelic at all. Whether you just want to experience local culture, or whether you want to find friends with similar interests, and have a place where you can, well, just use Gaelic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are really excited to launch this concept and we hope you are too. If you love coffee culture and your local culture - we'll help you marry the two! Thank you for taking the time to read our story and we look forward to welcoming you into An Taigh Cèilidh very soon.</p>

There's plenty to choose from in the UK, but the Outer Hebrides of Scotland have some of the oldest, most traditional ways of life in Europe. Tolgate Coffee is going to use its Kent branch as a foundation for its daughter branches, but each will have their own unique take on the local culture of their locations. 
And so, An Taigh Cèilidh was born.
When I lived in Italy and Poland, I had a genuinely immersive experience in the cultures and languages. This made my languages progress. When I did my PhD in Gaelic, I found that not only were there few (if any) immersive experiences for learners, there were few public spaces for more fluent and native speakers. I was particularly surprised to find no dedicated Gaelic spaces in Stornoway - the so-called ""Capital of the Western Isles"" - and the Western Isles being the so-called ""Traditional Gaelic Heartland"". Now that I teach Gaelic, students often ask for recommendations for immersive experiences. This is where Gaelic differs fundamentally from, say, Italian. And, living in Stornoway, my guests often ask me where they can experience local culture. As a Leòdhasach ùr ('New Lewisperson'), I am also concerned about the stability of the local culture, and I truly believe (as do organisations such as Bòrd na Gàidhlig, University of the Highlands and Islands, Visit the Outer Hebrides, and the Scottish Government) that Gaelic is not just of cultural value to Scotland, but also of genuine economic value. 
So, An Taigh Cèilidh will provide the immersive experience for learners, the social space for speakers, the flavour of the island to visitors, and the economic support to Gaelic arts and traditional industries. The space we intend to buy is on Cromwell Street in the heart of Stornoway, next door to the old Town Hall, the Stornoway Historical Society, and the Story of Harris Tweed exhibition. We are close to the ferry pier, the bus station, free and paid parking, An Lanntair arts centre, and most town centre accommodation. We will be on the pedestrianised section of Cromwell Street, which will allow us to open up onto the street, which will make Stornoway particularly lively on a good day! Therefore, we will be normalising Gaelic that can be used as an everyday language in public spaces, just as you'd find, say, Polish in Poland.
All staff will be Gaelic-speaking, and every interaction will start in Gaelic. We will host events and performances in Gaelic, such as talks about local history, singing, poetry recital, book readings, and traditional music. We will house Gaelic social clubs, such as a Gaelic book club for adults, a Gaelic book club for children, a Gaelic club for parents with children in Gaelic schools, a Gaelic knitting club, and a Gaelic dog club. We will have a daily conversation circle for Gaelic learners, and Gaelic-medium lessons for things such as art and French.
We will sell Gaelic books, Gaelic greetings cards, Gaelic post cards, Gaelic CDs, and Gaelic DVDs. We will sell gift items, such as soap, candles, tweed items, art, photos, frames, and cups - made by Gaelic speakers and all labelled in Gaelic. This will be good for gift ideas, souvenirs, and supporting Gaelic talent and economy. Some of our profits will go into developing a Gaelic Scrabble and a Gaelic Monopoly board games. The in-house coffee shop will use local products from the island where possible (e.g. Stornoway black pudding), with our baristas trained to make truly artisan coffees. There will be no plastic in the hub, and part of our mission is to highlight and educate on environmental issues, especially those affecting the Outer Hebrides. The walls of the hub will be used as space to showcase gift items (especially art and photography), as well as an exhibition space (especially educational exhibits, such as environmental issues).
As well as ethical pay initiatives to support our staff and suppliers, we will also invest in mentorship and internship programmes. We will support our suppliers in taking on mentees to help people - especially young people - to train in arts and traditional industries, such as Tweed making. We will invest in internships in the centre to help learners and young people to develop business skills that will help with a Gaelic and island economy. If the hub does well, this model can be replicated elsewhere, and our interns can go off to develop the other hubs, or develop their projects and ideas.
An Taigh Cèilidh will be a Gaelic-focused cultural centre with events and performances in Gaelic, gift items made by Gaelic speakers and labelled in Gaelic, housing Gaelic social activities. We will be investing in Gaelic speakers and the island economy. Above all, it will appeal to everyone, whether they are  a native speaker or have no Gaelic at all. Whether you just want to experience local culture, or whether you want to find friends with similar interests, and have a place where you can, well, just use Gaelic.
 
We are really excited to launch this concept and we hope you are too. If you love coffee culture and your local culture - we'll help you marry the two! Thank you for taking the time to read our story and we look forward to welcoming you into An Taigh Cèilidh very soon.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p><a href=""https://www.canadacomicsol.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Canada Comics Open Library </a>(CCOL) is a non-profit and volunteer-run comics library <a href=""https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2898358868"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">located</a> in Regent Park, Toronto, Ontario. CCOL was founded in the springtime of 2018. Our <a href=""https://www.canadacomicsol.org/mission/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">mission</a> is to help make comics more accessible while increasing representation of marginalized communities in comics, with a focus on BIPOC (Black, Indigenous and People of Colour), LGBTQ+, disabled, and women creators. We are working to achieve our mission through our <a href=""https://www.canadacomicsol.org/catalogue/opac/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">library collection</a> and space, online resources, and <a href=""https://www.canadacomicsol.org/category/events/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">community events</a>.</p>
<h3>Our Team</h3>
<p>We have a diverse board of directors made up of artists, librarians, and other professionals, the majority of which are women. In addition, we have 3 external advisors with experience in the comics industry, and over 20 volunteers who help run the library and events. You can read our bios <a href=""https://www.canadacomicsol.org/who-we-are/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>! We share a passion for comics and graphic novels, filling gap areas in comic arts accessibility, and encouraging community building through the arts and literature.</p>
<h3>Our Work</h3>
<p>We are a grassroots library and a giant labour of love that is very meaningful to the people involved and the community it serves. We have over 145 members now! We hope with your support we can continue to operate as an inclusive (and cozy) community space and library. CCOL was made possible through a lot of hard work and there have been a few challenges along the way, but the library is able to better fulfill its mission as a result. We have made several changes to our space based on feedback from library members and volunteers and aim to continue to grow the project in this way. Our long term goal is to grow CCOL into a nationwide comics library system, while reaching demographics that do not have access to comics.</p>
<p>We opened the comics library in March 2019 and have been in our library space at the <a href=""https://socialinnovation.org/location/csi-regent-park/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Centre for Social Innovation (CSI) Regent Park </a>for over 6 months now! Here are some of the things we've accomplished since our last campaign: </p>

</li>
<li>And most recently, we were awarded a Literary Project Grant through the Toronto Arts Council to host 5<a href=""https://www.canadacomicsol.org/get-involved/residencies/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Comics Creator Residencies </a>prioritizing women, trans, and non-binary comics creators.</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now, our collection includes over <strong>1320 comics</strong>, graphic novels, and zines —almost 3 times more than when we launched our last campaign— and it continues to grow. Just check out our <a href=""https://www.canadacomicsol.org/catalogue/opac/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">online catalogue</a>! </p>
<p>Here are a few collection stats to give you an idea of our focus areas:<br/><strong>10.2%</strong> of collection are <strong>LGBTQ+</strong> comics (<strong>136 </strong>comics)<br/><strong>15%</strong> of collection are made by <strong>BIPOC </strong>creators (Black, Indigenous, people of colour) (<strong>203</strong> comics)<br/><strong>11% </strong>of collection cover the topic of<strong> mental health, mental illness</strong> (<strong>146 </strong>comics)<br/><strong>3%</strong> of collection are comics that focus on <strong>physical health, disability</strong> (<strong>37 </strong>comics)<br/><strong>26% </strong>of collection are comics made by <strong>women </strong>(<strong>350</strong> comics)</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The last several months have been spent learning about the community the library exists within. We are working to make the library a welcoming space where you can drop by to read comics and speak with other people interested in comics and comic arts. You can also hang around to work on your own comics and art, use the<a href=""https://www.canadacomicsol.org/2019/06/13/tools-at-the-comics-library-and-in-the-csi-lounge/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> tools in the library and CSI lounge</a>, and participate in <a href=""https://www.canadacomicsol.org/category/events/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">workshops and other events</a>!</p>
<p>Comics can be hard to come by for a variety of reasons, such as the higher cost of their production, the limited distribution of self-published zines, indie comics that have limited runs for editions that go out of print, and the way they are organized or lack representation in public spaces. We want to support and grow the already vibrant comics community in Toronto and across Canada, as well as introduce the medium to new readerships who have previously lacked access to comics.</p>
<p>From its diverse and vibrant comics community, to the retail locations, and festivals, Toronto has been the perfect first home for our comics library.</p>
<p>It has been rewarding seeing the community surrounding our library grow, but, as a non-profit library, there have been many challenges and we need some extra help. This year we need your help to continue operating, and we want to make some big changes!</p>
<p>We hope that we will have the opportunity to show the community what we can do with more funding.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Next Year</h2>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Continue to keep our doors open and pay rent for a year! #keepccolopen</strong><br/><strong>$3,396</strong> rent for one year (12 months)<ul style=""margin-left:40px;""><li>Thanks to an amazing partnership with the <a href=""https://socialinnovation.org/location/csi-regent-park/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Centre for Social Innovation</a>, which enables us to rent a fully AODA accessible space for an affordable rate, and the help of dozens of volunteers, we are able to operate at a lower cost than our original estimate last campaign. We will be able to direct our funding to areas where it will make the most impact.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Cover administrative costs for the year</strong><br/><strong>$1,441</strong> Administrative costs and supplies: insurance for one year ($1,291) and general library supplies including printing, cataloguing, and office supplies ($150)</li>
<li>
<strong>Make our collection circulating!</strong><br/><strong>$700 </strong>to cover costs related to circulation                                                                                               <ul><li>This will involve adding barcodes and call number stickers to comics. To do this we will need to purchase a scanner and barcode printer, and to spend time preparing our system. </li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Total for basic operating + making the collection circulating = <strong>$5,537 </strong>at minimum.</p>
<h3>What else we would like to do</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Pay senior staff, artists, and workshop facilitators</strong><br/><strong>$7,000</strong>+ per year towards fair pay for our administrative staff member. We are currently volunteer-run, but we would like to pay a fair salary to current staff. <ul><li>One important principle of ours is to remove financial barriers to access to the comics medium. To do this, we keep our yearly library cards Pay What You Can (PWYC), and all workshops have been free. We have a $5 suggested amount per year and consider anything over this to be Pay-it-Forward...why? Because we will not turn anyone away! This means our memberships do not generate much revenue, and as a non-profit, revenue is how we do what we do. However, it takes a lot of work to build and run our library system. Currently, the entire library is run by volunteers! Eventually, we want to create a salary for our senior staff member. Extra money will also go towards paying artists to make art, present, and host community events at CCOL.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Pay artists to hold public workshops</strong><br/><strong>$2,733+</strong> for honorariums for artists, guests, panelists + workshop and event supplies (in addition to grant-funded projects). </li>
</ul>
<p>We are asking for funding to be able to do a lot more than just remain open during staffed hours— although being able to continue to operate as a special collection would still be amazing!</p>
<p>Total with EVERYTHING (basic operating <strong>+</strong> extras) = <strong>$15,270</strong></p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>If we reach the following funding goals this is what we can do this year!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>If we raise $3,396 ...</strong><ul><li>We stay open for another year operating the library. We aim to run CCOL as an important public service and community hub promoting literacy and the arts through comics and graphic novels. Help us achieve our mission by raising this funding goal.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>If we raise $4,837 ...</strong><ul><li>We are able to cover all of our administrative costs. These are important to make sure everyone is covered in case of accidents, the library branch can operate daily, and we have supplies available to community in the space.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>If we raise $5,537 ...</strong><ul><li>We make the CCOL collection a circulating one! This means you can checkout books and take them home to enjoy. We are very excited to meet this goal and hope you will help us get there!</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>If we raise $12,537 ...</strong><ul><li>We pay our dedicated staff member a salary. They can spend more time making sure that the library runs and meets its goals towards our mission.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>If we raise $15,270 ...</strong><ul><li>We pay Toronto artists fair honorariums to run public events including artists talks, workshops, and readings. We love to see people come and enjoy the space, learn something, and engage with artists and each other. Help us bring community members together with comics!</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>If we raise $30,000 ...</strong><ul><li>We run a BUNCH more events, keeping them all free, and we pay writers to regularly contribute to our blog!</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>If we raise $50,000 ... </strong><ul><li>Our part-time staff position becomes a full time position! This allows them to focus on: grant applications, outreach, website resources, acquisitions, project development, community partnerships, creating more opportunities for community members to engage with comics, and generally growing the project!</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>If we raise $100,000 ...</strong><ul><li>We hire additional part-time staff or two! This allows us to expand our resources, find and build new revenue streams, and grow more!</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>If we raise $200,000+ ...</strong><ul><li>We will pick a prairie city, and open a new branch ;)</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>If we raise, $2 000,000 + (we can dream)</strong><ul><li>We buy a building and open our own comics library, coffee shop, and art gallery!</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Because we are still a new and volunteer-run non-profit organization, we’ve encountered several challenges this past year:</p>
<p><strong>Grants: </strong>We submitted 4 grants applications this year so far, and we received our first project grant! However, we still don’t have the financial or social history required to qualify for any larger operating grants. There are also very few grants for non-profits that are not charities (and we are not a charity), and since we are unable to offer tax receipts, this understandably means less private donations as well.</p>
<p><strong>Rent: </strong>Although we are very lucky to be able to rent an accessible space at CSI, we still need to raise money for rent for the year. Our annual membership is free or PWYC with a suggested donation of $5 per year, and we will ALWAYS have a pool of free memberships for community members; we want to keep this affordable/free, but this also means less income for the project.</p>

<h2>Statements of support </h2>
<h3>This year</h3>
<p>“7 months ago I read about an incredible community resource needing a home: I learned that The Canada Comics Open Library is an educational, and recreational resource that uses comics and graphic novels as a catalyst to hold safe space to explore and have conversations about things like LGBTQ Identities, Mental Health,  intersectional issues, AND that it is the only resource in NORTH AMERICA dedicated solely to comics accessibility. 6 months ago, The Canada Comics Open Library moved into the CSI Regent Park space transforming a former coat closet into a magical space. We have seen the incredible way they invite the community in to explore art, and enjoy comics. We now know first hand what an incredible resource CCOL is, and are so happy to have them here with us!” </p>
<p>-<strong>Denise Soueidan-O'Leary</strong>, Community Manager, Centre for Social Innovation, Regent Park</p>
<p>“CCOL has been an invaluable resource for me. I’ve been able to build community around my love of comics. I love being able to sit in the space, talk about new books, and get recommendations for something new to read. It’s one of my favorite places in Toronto. Thank you CCOL for all your hard work!” </p>
<p>-<strong>Sophie Kaufman</strong>, Volunteer Librarian at CCOL</p>
<p>“The CCOL is a fantastic place - a quiet place for reading comics, or for exploratory artmaking and community. The CCOL's Database gives a long-needed central point for Canadian creators, spread out as we are. I was recently invited to the Whitby Comics Arts Festival, and learned they'd found me through the CCOL Database. I recommend all creators ensure they're there, and that they also drop in and witness the gorgeous collection and space at the Canada Comics Open Library.” </p>
<p>-<strong>Jep Clayton</strong>, Cartoonist and Educator</p>
<p>“...the little comics library that could is continuing to prove that a comics library is not only wanted, but very much a needed part of the literary community.”</p>
<p>-<strong>Wendy Browne</strong>, Women Write About Comics</p>
<p><a href=""https://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2019/09/the-canadian-comics-open-library-is-shaping-our-shelves/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2019/09/the-c...</a></p>
<p>“CCOL offers a vital space of community in the face of cuts to public services – more than just comic books, it’s a place of resistance to the status quo.”</p>
<p>-<strong>Rebecca Radevski</strong>, Law Librarian and Board Member at CCOL</p>
<h3>Last Campaign</h3>
<p>“Over the years of running The Beguiling, and helping start TCAF, few things have been clearer than the benefits of getting comics into the hands of more readers.  It may seem strange for someone whose business is selling comics to put efforts into methods that allow people to borrow them for free, but projects like CCOL can only benefit the whole comics community by growing a new readership, particularly among audiences that haven't had access to comics, and who have traditionally not found themselves represented there.""</p>
<p>-<strong>Peter Birkemoe</strong>, owner of The Beguiling and co-founder of the Toronto Comic Arts Festival</p>
<p>“As an educator and cartoonist I am very excited about The Canada Comics Open Library.  Having a resource for comic books, graphic novels, zines, cartoonists, collectives, and related activities in one spot is going to be a game changer in Toronto and beyond. Cartooning tends to be a lonely activity and the opportunity to join forces in these troubled times is a great thing. Comics have become one of the best mediums for empowering activism and creating change. Woot, Woot, CCOL!!”</p>
<p>-<strong>Fiona Smyth</strong>, cartoonist, illustrator, and instructor at OCAD University and the Art Gallery of Ontario</p>
<p>""Comics have become one of the most powerful forms of contemporary storytelling, whether they are about superheroes or everyday people, fantasy worlds or local neighbourhoods, major world events or deeply personal experiences. The Canada Comics Open Library will unfold this diverse world of comics in exciting new ways for both die-hard fans and new readers. Making comics accessible in a community space, identifying them by interests, themes, and topics, and organizing them to showcase their wealth of visual styles are all brilliant ideas to make the space welcoming and inclusive. The plans to host events and showcase comics creators will add to Toronto’s already vibrant comics scene and support local artists. Every city needs a branch of the Canada Comics Open Library!""</p>

And most recently, we were awarded a Literary Project Grant through the Toronto Arts Council to host 5 Comics Creator Residencies prioritizing women, trans, and non-binary comics creators.

Right now, our collection includes over 1320 comics, graphic novels, and zines —almost 3 times more than when we launched our last campaign— and it continues to grow. Just check out our online catalogue! 
Here are a few collection stats to give you an idea of our focus areas:10.2% of collection are LGBTQ+ comics (136 comics)15% of collection are made by BIPOC creators (Black, Indigenous, people of colour) (203 comics)11% of collection cover the topic of mental health, mental illness (146 comics)3% of collection are comics that focus on physical health, disability (37 comics)26% of collection are comics made by women (350 comics)

Impact
The last several months have been spent learning about the community the library exists within. We are working to make the library a welcoming space where you can drop by to read comics and speak with other people interested in comics and comic arts. You can also hang around to work on your own comics and art, use the tools in the library and CSI lounge, and participate in workshops and other events!
Comics can be hard to come by for a variety of reasons, such as the higher cost of their production, the limited distribution of self-published zines, indie comics that have limited runs for editions that go out of print, and the way they are organized or lack representation in public spaces. We want to support and grow the already vibrant comics community in Toronto and across Canada, as well as introduce the medium to new readerships who have previously lacked access to comics.
From its diverse and vibrant comics community, to the retail locations, and festivals, Toronto has been the perfect first home for our comics library.
It has been rewarding seeing the community surrounding our library grow, but, as a non-profit library, there have been many challenges and we need some extra help. This year we need your help to continue operating, and we want to make some big changes!
We hope that we will have the opportunity to show the community what we can do with more funding.

The Next Year
What we need


Continue to keep our doors open and pay rent for a year! #keepccolopen$3,396 rent for one year (12 months)Thanks to an amazing partnership with the Centre for Social Innovation, which enables us to rent a fully AODA accessible space for an affordable rate, and the help of dozens of volunteers, we are able to operate at a lower cost than our original estimate last campaign. We will be able to direct our funding to areas where it will make the most impact.


Cover administrative costs for the year$1,441 Administrative costs and supplies: insurance for one year ($1,291) and general library supplies including printing, cataloguing, and office supplies ($150)

Make our collection circulating!$700 to cover costs related to circulation                                                                                               This will involve adding barcodes and call number stickers to comics. To do this we will need to purchase a scanner and barcode printer, and to spend time preparing our system. 


Total for basic operating + making the collection circulating = $5,537 at minimum.
What else we would like to do


Pay senior staff, artists, and workshop facilitators$7,000+ per year towards fair pay for our administrative staff member. We are currently volunteer-run, but we would like to pay a fair salary to current staff. One important principle of ours is to remove financial barriers to access to the comics medium. To do this, we keep our yearly library cards Pay What You Can (PWYC), and all workshops have been free. We have a $5 suggested amount per year and consider anything over this to be Pay-it-Forward...why? Because we will not turn anyone away! This means our memberships do not generate much revenue, and as a non-profit, revenue is how we do what we do. However, it takes a lot of work to build and run our library system. Currently, the entire library is run by volunteers! Eventually, we want to create a salary for our senior staff member. Extra money will also go towards paying artists to make art, present, and host community events at CCOL.


Pay artists to hold public workshops$2,733+ for honorariums for artists, guests, panelists + workshop and event supplies (in addition to grant-funded projects). 

We are asking for funding to be able to do a lot more than just remain open during staffed hours— although being able to continue to operate as a special collection would still be amazing!
Total with EVERYTHING (basic operating + extras) = $15,270
Goals
If we reach the following funding goals this is what we can do this year!


If we raise $3,396 ...We stay open for another year operating the library. We aim to run CCOL as an important public service and community hub promoting literacy and the arts through comics and graphic novels. Help us achieve our mission by raising this funding goal.


If we raise $4,837 ...We are able to cover all of our administrative costs. These are important to make sure everyone is covered in case of accidents, the library branch can operate daily, and we have supplies available to community in the space.


If we raise $5,537 ...We make the CCOL collection a circulating one! This means you can checkout books and take them home to enjoy. We are very excited to meet this goal and hope you will help us get there!


If we raise $12,537 ...We pay our dedicated staff member a salary. They can spend more time making sure that the library runs and meets its goals towards our mission.


If we raise $15,270 ...We pay Toronto artists fair honorariums to run public events including artists talks, workshops, and readings. We love to see people come and enjoy the space, learn something, and engage with artists and each other. Help us bring community members together with comics!


If we raise $30,000 ...We run a BUNCH more events, keeping them all free, and we pay writers to regularly contribute to our blog!


If we raise $50,000 ... Our part-time staff position becomes a full time position! This allows them to focus on: grant applications, outreach, website resources, acquisitions, project development, community partnerships, creating more opportunities for community members to engage with comics, and generally growing the project!


If we raise $100,000 ...We hire additional part-time staff or two! This allows us to expand our resources, find and build new revenue streams, and grow more!


If we raise $200,000+ ...We will pick a prairie city, and open a new branch ;)


If we raise, $2 000,000 + (we can dream)We buy a building and open our own comics library, coffee shop, and art gallery!



Challenges
Because we are still a new and volunteer-run non-profit organization, we’ve encountered several challenges this past year:
Grants: We submitted 4 grants applications this year so far, and we received our first project grant! However, we still don’t have the financial or social history required to qualify for any larger operating grants. There are also very few grants for non-profits that are not charities (and we are not a charity), and since we are unable to offer tax receipts, this understandably means less private donations as well.
Rent: Although we are very lucky to be able to rent an accessible space at CSI, we still need to raise money for rent for the year. Our annual membership is free or PWYC with a suggested donation of $5 per year, and we will ALWAYS have a pool of free memberships for community members; we want to keep this affordable/free, but this also means less income for the project.
Additional perks info

Statements of support 
This year
“7 months ago I read about an incredible community resource needing a home: I learned that The Canada Comics Open Library is an educational, and recreational resource that uses comics and graphic novels as a catalyst to hold safe space to explore and have conversations about things like LGBTQ Identities, Mental Health,  intersectional issues, AND that it is the only resource in NORTH AMERICA dedicated solely to comics accessibility. 6 months ago, The Canada Comics Open Library moved into the CSI Regent Park space transforming a former coat closet into a magical space. We have seen the incredible way they invite the community in to explore art, and enjoy comics. We now know first hand what an incredible resource CCOL is, and are so happy to have them here with us!” 
-Denise Soueidan-O'Leary, Community Manager, Centre for Social Innovation, Regent Park
“CCOL has been an invaluable resource for me. I’ve been able to build community around my love of comics. I love being able to sit in the space, talk about new books, and get recommendations for something new to read. It’s one of my favorite places in Toronto. Thank you CCOL for all your hard work!” 
-Sophie Kaufman, Volunteer Librarian at CCOL
“The CCOL is a fantastic place - a quiet place for reading comics, or for exploratory artmaking and community. The CCOL's Database gives a long-needed central point for Canadian creators, spread out as we are. I was recently invited to the Whitby Comics Arts Festival, and learned they'd found me through the CCOL Database. I recommend all creators ensure they're there, and that they also drop in and witness the gorgeous collection and space at the Canada Comics Open Library.” 
-Jep Clayton, Cartoonist and Educator
“...the little comics library that could is continuing to prove that a comics library is not only wanted, but very much a needed part of the literary community.”
-Wendy Browne, Women Write About Comics
https://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2019/09/the-c...
“CCOL offers a vital space of community in the face of cuts to public services – more than just comic books, it’s a place of resistance to the status quo.”
-Rebecca Radevski, Law Librarian and Board Member at CCOL
Last Campaign
“Over the years of running The Beguiling, and helping start TCAF, few things have been clearer than the benefits of getting comics into the hands of more readers.  It may seem strange for someone whose business is selling comics to put efforts into methods that allow people to borrow them for free, but projects like CCOL can only benefit the whole comics community by growing a new readership, particularly among audiences that haven't had access to comics, and who have traditionally not found themselves represented there.""
-Peter Birkemoe, owner of The Beguiling and co-founder of the Toronto Comic Arts Festival
“As an educator and cartoonist I am very excited about The Canada Comics Open Library.  Having a resource for comic books, graphic novels, zines, cartoonists, collectives, and related activities in one spot is going to be a game changer in Toronto and beyond. Cartooning tends to be a lonely activity and the opportunity to join forces in these troubled times is a great thing. Comics have become one of the best mediums for empowering activism and creating change. Woot, Woot, CCOL!!”
-Fiona Smyth, cartoonist, illustrator, and instructor at OCAD University and the Art Gallery of Ontario
""Comics have become one of the most powerful forms of contemporary storytelling, whether they are about superheroes or everyday people, fantasy worlds or local neighbourhoods, major world events or deeply personal experiences. The Canada Comics Open Library will unfold this diverse world of comics in exciting new ways for both die-hard fans and new readers. Making comics accessible in a community space, identifying them by interests, themes, and topics, and organizing them to showcase their wealth of visual styles are all brilliant ideas to make the space welcoming and inclusive. The plans to host events and showcase comics creators will add to Toronto’s already vibrant comics scene and support local artists. Every city needs a branch of the Canada Comics Open Library!""

<p>FarmProv began when a group of passionate friends who lived together on a farm Riverside wanted to help each other use their talents by throwing comedy events at their home. They built a stage, prepared food we grew and raised, and had a ton of fun hosting over 150 diverse people at each show.</p>
<p>After we all moved, we went our separate ways, but after a few meaningful contributions to society, we are returning to form FarmProv, an initiative to build funnier, healthier communities across the Southeast.</p>
<p>Our goal is to generate revenue for sustainable farms, and bring improv troupes, comedians, and musicians to new audiences. We’ll also raise money for Wholesome Wave Georgia at each FarmProv event, to make the food grown on those farms more accessible for everyone.</p>
<p>We are starting at Urban Sprout Farms, a space for good food and entertainment in Lakewood. It’s a small farm with big dreams of becoming a pillar for entertainment and fresh food in the Lakewood community. We want to help them grow, and establish a home for FarmProv in 2019.</p>
<p>Urban Sprout Farms built a stage this year, but the stage needs to be covered to host events and classes during inclement weather. With a stage covered by solar panels, they will be able to host and power workshops, classes, and events all year -- including FarmProv -- adding a significant revenue stream to the operation. FarmProv is looking to purchase lighting, sound, and stage equipment to give attendees the full experience.</p>
<p>Donate to our campaign to help take FarmProv and Urban Sprout Farms to new heights. Together, we can laugh our way to a better future!</p>
<h3><strong>Each FarmProv event is designed to accomplish main goals:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Pay the farm and the performers a reasonable wage for their work.</li>
<li>Purchase products grown or made on the farm to use in the food served at the event.</li>
<li>Raise money for Wholesome Wave Georgia, which doubles the value of SNAP/EBT at farmers markets.</li>
<li>Bring diverse audiences together to build community through laughter and food.</li>
</ul>

They built a stage, prepared food we grew and raised, and had a ton of fun hosting over 150 diverse people at each show.
After we all moved, we went our separate ways, but after a few meaningful contributions to society, we are returning to form FarmProv, an initiative to build funnier, healthier communities across the Southeast.
Our goal is to generate revenue for sustainable farms, and bring improv troupes, comedians, and musicians to new audiences. We’ll also raise money for Wholesome Wave Georgia at each FarmProv event, to make the food grown on those farms more accessible for everyone.
We are starting at Urban Sprout Farms, a space for good food and entertainment in Lakewood. It’s a small farm with big dreams of becoming a pillar for entertainment and fresh food in the Lakewood community. We want to help them grow, and establish a home for FarmProv in 2019.
Urban Sprout Farms built a stage this year, but the stage needs to be covered to host events and classes during inclement weather. With a stage covered by solar panels, they will be able to host and power workshops, classes, and events all year -- including FarmProv -- adding a significant revenue stream to the operation. FarmProv is looking to purchase lighting, sound, and stage equipment to give attendees the full experience.
Donate to our campaign to help take FarmProv and Urban Sprout Farms to new heights. Together, we can laugh our way to a better future!
Each FarmProv event is designed to accomplish main goals:

Pay the farm and the performers a reasonable wage for their work.
Purchase products grown or made on the farm to use in the food served at the event.
Raise money for Wholesome Wave Georgia, which doubles the value of SNAP/EBT at farmers markets.
Bring diverse audiences together to build community through laughter and food.

Here’s The Team

<p>We organize it in a self-managed way, consisting of day by day collectives, and our commitment to taking care of the communal spaces in our respective locations. </p>
<p>The first International Community festival: Living without borders! Was done on the community of <strong>La Carpio, Costa Rica, in the year 2016</strong>. We were able to enroll more than <strong>500 people, from 12 different nationalities</strong> on the activities that we created together.</p>
<p>The second <strong>International Community Festival: Living Together in Freedom?</strong>, will be taking place in J<strong>anuary 2019</strong> at the venue of “Grupo Iuna de Capoeira” Angola in <strong>Belo Horizonte, Brazil. </strong></p>
<p>Everyone interested in promoting, contributing and being part of this encounter, are welcome to join! <strong>The FIC is being offered in a free and community funded way!</strong></p>
<p>This festival’s production has an approximate cost of $35.000. This amount is possible thanks to the collaborative work and material contribution of people, government organizations, NGOs, families and neighborhood organizations from the locality in which the encounter takes place.</p>
<p>With the money that was left from 2016’s FIC ($1000) and the donations from the involved organizations, we only have $11.000 left to pay; this is for the air tickets of 8 people from the production team, lodging, transportation around the city, food for everyone involved with the FIC, materials for the workshops and necessary improvements in the capoeira school’s main room (as a contribution of solidarity for hosting the festival). </p>

We have theatre backgrounds and wanted to dive back in and make art that is passionate and that we can be proud of. Thus, Nasty Theatre Company was born. Nasty Theatre Company's mission is to produce culturally relevant and thought-provoking theatre, in an environment for all artists, that creates a positive dialogue and inspires change. We are influenced by those who march to the beat of their own drum, who want to see better things happen in the world, and who are, yes, a little nasty. In picking our first show, we knew it had to be one that celebrates women and diversity, has a positive message and is pertinent today. We chose Stop Kiss, a play about two women who explore their true feelings for the first time and endure backlash and judgment rather than support. These two women decide to be true to themselves in spite of this and we wanted to share their story and remind our audiences to love who they are and one another.<br/><br/>It’s easy to think, “It's 2017, things have already gotten so much better!” While certain conditions have improved in America since the Stonewall Riots in 1969, there is much progress that still needs to be made. Take a look at Chechen, Russia, where gay men are being detained in detention centers and tortured. Take a look at Kenya, Ethiopia, Pakistan, India and over 25 other countries in which being gay is considered illegal, not to mention the 10 countries in which it is punishable by death. Take a look at Texas, whose governor signed a bill allowing state-funded adoption and foster care agencies to discriminate against same-sex couples, and would also allow the practice of “conversion therapy”. According to research done by the Trevor Project, “the rate of suicide attempts is 4 times greater for LGB youth and 2 times greater for questioning youth than that of straight youth”, and that isn’t even including transgender youth. Past crusaders have helped pave the way for LGBT rights, but it is up to us to keep the fight going and ensure a better future for generations to come. We at Nasty Theatre Company plan to advocate these rights and beliefs with our production of Stop Kiss in more ways than one.<strong> On opening night, we will donate half of our ticket sales to the National Center for Lesbian Rights,</strong> an organization dedicated to LGBT rights and protection through litigation, legislation, policy and public education.<br/><br/>Now that we’ve discussed the importance of your donation, let’s talk details! We are looking to raise $9,000 for this production. That may sound like we’re overshooting, but when you include the rental fees for the theatre, rights for the production, sets, costumes, advertising and payment for our actors, money disappears quickly. We’re hoping to put on the best production of this show possible and we cannot do that without your support! We have a ton of prizes to offer, including stickers, t-shirts, hats, free tickets to our show and even free drinks at the show! Any little bit helps and no donation is too small (except pennies, those are worthless). We will be posting updates on our website, Instagram and Facebook page so you can see exactly what your money is going to. Even if you can’t donate, please feel free to share this page and show your support to others and help us get the word out! We have a cast and crew of talented and dedicated individuals who are excited to share this important story and eager to entertain our wonderful supporters.<br/><br/>Below is the website for the National Center for Lesbian Rights and we will be including a link to our website as soon as it launches!

We at Nasty Theatre Company plan to advocate these rights and beliefs with our production of Stop Kiss in more ways than one. On opening night, we will donate half of our ticket sales to the National Center for Lesbian Rights, an organization dedicated to LGBT rights and protection through litigation, legislation, policy and public education.Now that we’ve discussed the importance of your donation, let’s talk details! We are looking to raise $9,000 for this production. That may sound like we’re overshooting, but when you include the rental fees for the theatre, rights for the production, sets, costumes, advertising and payment for our actors, money disappears quickly. We’re hoping to put on the best production of this show possible and we cannot do that without your support! We have a ton of prizes to offer, including stickers, t-shirts, hats, free tickets to our show and even free drinks at the show! Any little bit helps and no donation is too small (except pennies, those are worthless). We will be posting updates on our website, Instagram and Facebook page so you can see exactly what your money is going to. Even if you can’t donate, please feel free to share this page and show your support to others and help us get the word out! We have a cast and crew of talented and dedicated individuals who are excited to share this important story and eager to entertain our wonderful supporters.Below is the website for the National Center for Lesbian Rights and we will be including a link to our website as soon as it launches! We only have a little over a month to reach our goal, so help us make art and change happen!http://www.nastytheatrecompany.comhttp://www.nclrights.org/",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Whatever it may take, we’ve decided to follow our dream till the end and do our best to launch a long-awaited DIY music cultural centre in Vilnius. Planned to open in the fall of 2019, the centre will welcome free minds from all around the world:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Musicians and sound artists</strong> will come here to not only perform, but also reside, experiment, collaborate, record and release their creations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Visual, interdisciplinary and other artists</strong> will collaborate with musicians, or simply enjoy the possibility to exhibit their creations to the public.</li>
<li>
<strong>Everyone from the public</strong> will get the possibility to<ul>
<li>attend our concerts, performances, exhibitions, workshops and other events,</li>
<li>start practicing music or sound art using music instruments and sound equipment available at the centre,</li>
<li>seek yet another way to get involved into centre’s activities, and become a vital part of the community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter the form of participation, everyone at the centre will be expected to share a common interest in independent creation, DIY philosophy or self sustaining living. Fostering these values, as well as evolution of culture in general, is the ultimate goal we seek.</p>
<p>For the centre to work properly, we’ll provide our residents and guests with all needed facilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>a concert hall,</li>
<li>a recording studio,</li>
<li>a music library,</li>
<li>a gallery space,</li>
<li>a projection room,</li>
<li>a residency,</li>
<li>a canteen and cafe.</li>

<p>We believe the centre will be a significant step forward in DIY music culture, at least in the region, as no similar space has ever existed before in Lithuania or anywhere in the Baltics.</p>

This multi-day festival will be the launch of the Astrodome's next chapter as a civic space for all of Houston to enjoy. With your support, we’ll be one step closer to ensuring that this icon gets the comeback it deserves.Opened in 1965 to shield baseball fans from the nagging mosquitoes and oppressive heat of coastal Texas, the Astrodome put Houston on the map as the home of the first domed stadium on the planet. But that wasn’t the only first. In addition to giving the world “Astro Turf,” the Dome was home to the first skybox and the first animated scoreboard. And with the largest indoor space ever created by mankind, it certainly gave credence to the expression that everything is, in fact, bigger in Texas.The Dome was home to so much more than its MLB namesake, the Houston Astros. Everyone from Evel Knievel and Muhammad Ali to Elvis and the Supremes thrilled packed audiences inside the Astrodome. Bobby Riggs and Billie Jean King competed in the “Battle of the Sexes” tennis match there in 1973, and Nolan Ryan threw one of his seven no-hitters under that awe-inspiring ceiling. And then there was pro football (remember the Oilers?) and years of rowdy livestock shows and rodeos. Simply put, this is where Houston came to play.Unfortunately, its quirky design and engineering feats weren’t enough to keep the Dome afloat. Over the years, its core tenants gradually peeled away to newer stadiums, including one that was constructed just feet from the Dome itself. And just like that, the soaring structure that shocked the world now sat empty.The party was over—or so some people thought.Today, ambitious plans are afoot to bring the legendary landmark back as a vibrant public space. But what exactly does that look like? The Astrodome Conservancy envisions a multi-day festival that previews the Astrodome’s future use by showcasing innovative public art, exciting sports activities, and one of the Dome's great strengths—live music. In this way, Dome lovers can experience this iconic place in a new light, and a new generation of Houstonians will get the chance to meet the “8th Wonder.”Success! We're happy to report that our campaign raised $40,060! That's $25,060 above our original goal of $15,000!Thanks to the generous support of our backers, we will soon show the world that the groundbreaking Astrodome still has plenty of days left and new generations to enjoy it.Please stay tuned to the updates section of this page for additional project news.I claimed tickets to the Bruno Mars: 24K Magic World Tour as my perk and have questions.

<h3>THE EVENKI</h3>
<p>Set in the sweeping wild landscape of deepest Siberia, in a land called Evenkia, the Udygir family and their ancestors have been nomads for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>This is where I met Vladimir Udygir, ""my Evenki Grandpa"" and I felt I've known him for ever.<br/>I also saw that most of the Evenki families have already given up on the traditional way of living. His family was one of the last to live in the forest: Grandpa, his adult children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>The Evenkis’ reindeer are domesticated and they are essential to living in the forest. They have small herds and they treat the animals with care and affection: the herding is based on a close relationship between the deer and the humans. These animals are rather transport than food source through the vast taiga forest and uniquely the Evenki even ride special “saddle-reindeer” which have an intimate bond with their riders.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_500/v1502138544/x9gapvg3a9rt1bcewu6a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>But due to a sad series of unfortunate family events (that you can read about in the Impact part), the Udygir family recently lost their reindeer herd, and without them they cannot live and travel out in the forest. If they give up, as so many Evenki families already have, this unique and ancient way of being will be lost forever...</p>
<p>Vladimir’s deepest desire is to keep the nomadic tradition alive. He must pass on his knowledge and passion while he can.</p>
<p>But without reindeer it’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Their future is now in our hands.</strong><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>A FILM STORY</h3>
<p><i>(Please note this crowdfunding is JUST for the reindeer - this is not fundraising for the documentary film).</i></p>
<p>I met Vladimir more than ten years ago and we started shooting a film about the Evenki way of life, living and traveling together in the taiga forest. I was amazed to see this kind of way of life in the 21st century. More amazingly they seemed a truly happy family unlike the other Evenki families in the villages, who gave up their culture and often got caught in the deadly spiral of alcohol addiction.  </p>
<p><strong>It was obvious that the health and the well being of the Evenki people is directly tied to their life in the forest and with their reindeer.</strong></p>
<p>But then I lost the track of Vladimir for a decade, though I never gave up my dream to complete the film about their remarkable life.</p>
<p>Miraculously I recently found a bunch of old photos from the 1930's taken by missionaries who interacted with the Udygir family’s direct ancestors!</p>
<p><strong>I believe the Udygir family must also see these pictures.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_500/v1502135773/qvcwjbq1idtox0fdfcic.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Even though I kept trying to contact the family I met 10 years ago, I had no idea even if Grandpa Vladimir was still alive.  </p>
<p>And then, thanks to social media I found Jordan, a young American who happened to live with our Evenki Grandpa’s son-in-law for several years! Jordan told me that Grandpa is still OK and had been asking for many years about why I had never returned!<br/>I was touched... But I also heard from Jordan that tragically he has lost all his reindeer.</p>
<p>This is when we decided to start this campaign to help them and at the same time to save a small part of a disappearing culture.</p>
<p>This is also a beautiful opportunity to finish the film, that I started 10 years ago, as Grandpa gets back his herd of reindeer and with them his heritage and hope for his family for the future.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE PROJECT</h3>
<p>The plan is to buy a small herd of 20 reindeer which is sufficient to restart the Udygir family’s nomadic way of life.<br/>One reindeer costs about $600 USD, so we need to raise $12,000 USD to buy the herd alone. Above that are the costs of transporting the animals to the family from where they are purchased in other locations in Siberia.</p>
<p>Obviously the more money we raise, the more reindeer we’re going to be able to buy... and that helps a lot to keep their way of life and culture alive!<br/><strong>Also, if we raise money for enough reindeer, we also intend to donate some animals to other families in the tribe.</strong></p>
<p>We will film the whole reindeer-operation, the intimate moment when Grandpa Vladimir and his family get back the reindeer herd. With the addition of our footage from 2005-2006 we can complete the film about this unique family.<br/> </p>
<h3>IMPACT</h3>
<p>You may raise the question what happened to Vladimir’s reindeer...? Well, since 2006 he went blind and the people that he was travelling with in that time were not keen on reindeer herding and gambled away his animals. Vladimir was unable to keep the reindeer alone.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_500/v1502137794/xwbcvjvgyul54n7gsaaj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>But recently he reunited with one of his daughters, Valya, and his grandchildren. Valya is also determined to keep the traditions alive and save their culture. They even organize ""taiga schools"" for the small children to be able to get education in the forest. If we manage to get them reindeer, then no doubt they will be in the right and competent  hands. </p>
<p>Vladimir is with Valya’s family and still going strong. He has now the opportunity to pass his invaluable knowledge on to the next generations.<br/><br/>But only with your help.<br/> </p>

They quickly became like family to me and we shared in both the highs and lows of life. Unfortunately their culture faces unique hurdles it will have to overcome if it is to survive and pass its richness on to future generations. If the last herders give up their way of life for the ease and alcohol of the village like so many already have, this unique and ancient way of being will be lost forever. I believe it is indescribably valuable not only to the individual Evenki but also to the whole of human culture to support those still practicing their ways and make sure they can successfully pass it on. You can watch some videos from Evenkia on <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/hobojordo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my youtube channel</a> .<br/><br/><strong>Rachel Jonas</strong><br/>I am a freelance photo journalist who spent a summer with the Evenki in 2015. During my time there, I was so impressed by the them.  The Evenki are a resilient, resourceful, warm people with a strong connection to the reindeer and the nature they share.  I remember more than once hearing the herders say that their life in the forest teaches them only to take what they need not more. They live with respect for the nature around them. In fact, it was more than respect.  It was a kind of rare harmony that lacked the neurosis of the modern world.  But life for the tribe, is under threat.  Their sustainability is directly tied to the reindeer and now they need our help.  I am excited about this project and the prospect of helping restore to them some hope for continuing this invaluable way of life.

They quickly became like family to me and we shared in both the highs and lows of life. Unfortunately their culture faces unique hurdles it will have to overcome if it is to survive and pass its richness on to future generations. If the last herders give up their way of life for the ease and alcohol of the village like so many already have, this unique and ancient way of being will be lost forever. I believe it is indescribably valuable not only to the individual Evenki but also to the whole of human culture to support those still practicing their ways and make sure they can successfully pass it on. You can watch some videos from Evenkia on my youtube channel .Rachel JonasI am a freelance photo journalist who spent a summer with the Evenki in 2015. During my time there, I was so impressed by the them.  The Evenki are a resilient, resourceful, warm people with a strong connection to the reindeer and the nature they share.  I remember more than once hearing the herders say that their life in the forest teaches them only to take what they need not more. They live with respect for the nature around them. In fact, it was more than respect.  It was a kind of rare harmony that lacked the neurosis of the modern world.  But life for the tribe, is under threat.  Their sustainability is directly tied to the reindeer and now they need our help.  I am excited about this project and the prospect of helping restore to them some hope for continuing this invaluable way of life.

We'll be achieving this through a series of pop-up concerts in intimate home gatherings and larger event venues throughout New York City starting this Spring. As the pastry point person for this exciting endeavor, please help me raise an updated total of $5,000 in the next three days. This additional $2,000 will go directly toward the diverse, international dessert selections at these gatherings - in addition to developing a cake-as-art installation at our launch party later this year. I'm in the process of curating a set of large, tiered cakes that will cumulatively tell stories of the plight of refugees around the world - and I couldn't be more excited about it! DESSERTS CONTAIN IMMENSE POWER FOR GLOBAL CONNECTION.Call it crazy, but it's real.By harnessing the universal excitement around cakes, pastries, and traditional sweets, we've effectively connected people from all corners of the world. Through food, we’re able to blur the lines between cultures, races, class systems, and religions - and personalize experiences that are otherwise foreign. We're currently in the middle of the world's largest refugee crisis since WWII. Terrorism has found new soil. The dark reality of our global food supply is forcing us to think creatively - and quickly.  Political elections are gaining strength from focused hate and reckless fear. And in this time of change, I know that desserts engage an audience wide enough to create great impact. THE PROJECTWhisk Me Away Cakes is embarking on a solo culinary journey through East Africa! From February 15th to April 1st, 2017, I’ll be spending six weeks abroad - assembling a series of articles, video shorts, and photojournalism collections featuring rural cooks and sharing their favorite recipes. I plan to include discussions as they naturally evolve, involving family histories, agricultural practices, regional issues, personal stories, and individual hopes for our global future - all told through food, specifically desserts where appropriate. THE FOUNDERRose McAdoo strives to live at the intersection of agriculture, food production, international development, and social justice. She uses dessert to create safe, lighthearted spaces surrounding heavy topics - and believes in the power of a shared meal to foster cultural understanding.In addition to running Whisk Me Away Cakes, she works as a cake decorator at Nine Cakes and as a farmhand and events assistant at Brooklyn Grange Rooftop Farm. She has a decade of experience in baking and pastry arts, has developed programming around culinary education, and frequently backpacks abroad to gain experience in international farming and cooking practices. So far, she's gotten her hands dirty on farms and in kitchens in the U.S., Canada, England, Scotland, Ireland, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Costa Rica, Argentina, and Chile.Rose has established relationships with a local South Sudanese refugee population in Syracuse, and works closely with the NYC Refugee & Immigrant Fund - developing international pastry menus to increase engagement at their events and welcoming as many asylum seekers as possible into her personal home. THE ITINERARY*Schedule subject to change and growKENYA
I’ll start my adventure by exploring Nairobi’s street food with Susan Kamau - Kenya’s most well-known chef and Regional Culinary Ambassador for the UN’s Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. [in progress]

An invitation stands to stay and cook with the tribe members behind Maji Moto Maasai Camp - a thoughtful and internally-run outlet which allows for respectful tourist access and a view into tribe practices. Among other responsibilities, I’ll be assisting on and harvesting from their farm, a new endeavor of a tribe that typically practiced strict hunter-gatherer methods.
I’ll be accompanying Maasai tribal elders on a multi-day bush walk - cooking over the campfire and under the stars, and engaging in a traditional goat slaughter.
KENYAN/UGANDAN BORDERThrough WWOOF (Worldwide Opportunities on Organic Farms), I’ll be staying on Mfangano Island in Lake Victoria. From there, I’ll be traveling to Remba - an overpopulated slum island where its 3,500-6,000 inhabitants (depending on the day’s fish catch) are depleting surrounding waters. Local Health Dispensary Chairman, John Keri, has established a farm on the island to promote agricultural education and economic diversification. Coming with a background in soil-based urban rooftop farming, John and I share the experience of farming with tight space requirements and limited access to necessary resources. He has organized a board meeting upon my arrival so we may identify obstacles and brainstorm solutions with the community.UGANDAOn my land-based journey to Rwanda, I’m taking a stopover in Kampala to visit and work with professional cake decorators for a day or two.RWANDA
In Kigali, I’ll be staying with the family of an asylum seeker I befriended as we farmed together in New York. His brother will then escort me to a rural village two hours from Kigali to garden and cook with his mother on the Rwandan/Congolese border.
I’ll also be connecting with local men and women through the Kula Coffee Project, One Acre Fund (see below), and the country's first microbrewery, which is female-owned and -operated.  [in progress]

TANZANIA
I’m in contact with staff members at the International Rescue Committee in order to secure an opportunity to prepare meals and learn more about food access in crisis settings with the cooks at Nyarugusu Refugee Camp on the border of Tanzania and Burundi. [in progress]

A business-connection-turned-good-friend manages an agricultural nonprofit in Iringa. Through her invitation, I’ll be spending much of my time visiting subsistence farmers and rural bakers who are all members of One Acre Fund.
The founders behind Kokoa Kamili have been vital connections to me over the past few years. We sourced their cacao beans at a chocolate factory that I managed in Brooklyn, and I hope to finally meet their founders during their off-season in Dar Es Salaam. [in progress]

A quick jaunt over to Zanzibar Town will place me directly in the heart of the spice trade of the 19th century - and gift me the dynamic flavors and rich culinary traditions of its blended Arab, Indian, and African populations.
A close friend of mine is a born-and-bred Tanzanian safari guide with family rooted in the tourism and hospitality industries. Spending my last few days with him in Arusha will allow me a comfortable and well-connected home base from which to tie up any loose ends on my journey.

</ul><p> </p><p>The Cinque Terre's traditional heritage wine is a dry white wine made with three varieties of grapes: Bosco, Albarolo and Vermentino.   These grapes are grown in vineyards within the national park, surrounding the villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso.  Because production is limited due to obvious geographical restrictions,  Cinque Terre wine is difficult to find outside of this area.  As described in Bella Vita Travels, <i>""The dry white wine is a straw colored, light bodied wine. Its main characteristics are its fresh acidic bite and interesting minerality. Within the glass, you can smell aromas of the surrounding lemon trees and wild herbs. You can vaguely taste a salinity from the craggy rocks in which the roots grow and the salt air surrounding the plants."" </i></p><p>All bottles purchased through the Grapes &amp; Heroes crowdfunding campaign will arrive signed by the winemaker...  making them truly special!  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578587031/hd5hztzex0ny8e7ekvjz.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The pride of the Cinque Terre is its sweet, amber-colored <i>Sciacchetrà</i> dessert wine (pronounced shock-keh-trah). Why is <i>Sciacchetrà</i> so expensive?  In order to make just one bottle of this sweet wine, an astonishing 45 pounds of fresh grapes are required (these grapes are left to wither to 15 pounds of partially dried ones before being pressed).  During the harvest, winemakers identify the highest quality grapes in their vineyards.  Before choosing them, the sugar content of each individual cluster must be measured to determine if it falls within a specific range.  If the cluster passes this test, it will be cut and hung to dry in a cellar for up to 40 days.  In November it is common to see locals gathered in the cantinas for hours upon end.  What are they doing you might ask? They are removing each partially dried grape from the stem by hand!  <i>Sciacchetrà</i> should age for at least 6 years but good vintages can age 10, 20, even 30 years!  Production is extremely limited which also explains why it is considered precious to locals. It's tradition to open a bottle for special occasions like weddings, baptisms and first communions. Oftentimes when a child is born in the Cinque Terre, a bottle of <i>Sciacchetrà</i> is kept in reserve and only opened on the child's 18th birthday!</p><p><i>Fine print: For those residing within the U.S., only persons over the age of 21 will be permitted to choose vouchers for perks including alcohol (in other countries it will be the minimum drinking age allowed by law).  Once you are emailed your voucher, you will be instructed on how to redeem your wine. <strong><u>Wine is available for shipping within the United States to every state except UT, AR, MS, AL, DE and RI</u>.</strong>  Please note that worldwide shipping expenses are <u>included</u> in the cost of the perk.  However, any potential duty or customs fees (if required by your country) are not.</i>  </p><p> </p><h2>Italy Travel Guide Memberships</h2><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578587140/kqdmddwwyc8du6gtxxw3.jpg"" src=""""/></p><ul><li><strong>Gigi Guides Membership from Italian Fix (special promo rate: €100, normal price €197)</strong></li></ul><p> </p><p>Gigi Guides contains all of the information you need to plan a perfect trip to Rome, Venice, Florence and/or the Cinque Terre, and has been carefully curated by in-the-know-locals.  Your membership gives you access to the most up-to-date recommendations on accommodations, places to eat, things to do and where to go in each city, with additional chapters on the lay of the land (so you can quickly get your bearings), tips and tricks for navigating the area like a pro, and ""out of the box"" sample itineraries written by residents who will tell you how they would spend a perfect day to make the most of their home turf.  Also included is a bonus section called Plan Your Trip, which covers itinerary planning, what to pack, how to save money on bank fees and currency exchange, how to get around on trains, how to rent a car, and ordering a meal like an Italian.  Gigi Guides is a veritable treasure trove of insider info for DIYers who want the straight goods on how to elevate their trip from run-of-the-mill to out-of-this-world. Each chapter comes with audio, video and pdf options, so you can listen, watch, or read your way to creating the Italian holiday of your dreams.</p><p><i>Fine print: Within 2 weeks of the end of the campaign you will be emailed instructions on how to redeem this perk.</i></p><p> </p><h2>Wine Tastings</h2><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578587166/vf3wgkbaezxph2b2mzkk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><ul>

What very few visitors realize is that this area is much more than just five colorful villages dotting a picturesque stretch of the Italian Riviera; the true heart and heritage of this region are found on its steep hillsides in its terraced vineyards.  But these terraces⁠—and the dry stone walls that support them⁠—are crumbling.  The Cinque Terre was hit hard by incessant and intense storms in the fall of 2019.  These back-to-back weather fronts poured torrential rain on the region, saturating the land and causing the collapse of countless dry stone walls.  It will take years to repair the damage, but restoring them is imperative: these walls provide structural support to an already fragile region.    These walls are not just a scenic feature of the landscape, they are the backbone of the Cinque Terre, keeping it erect and preventing it from washing to the sea.  The responsibility of rebuilding these walls falls squarely—and weighs heavily—on the shoulders of those who work the land: its winemakers.  “At this rate, the walls that collapse will always be greater than the number we can rebuild.  Making matters worse are the prohibitive costs involved, especially considering we are micro vintners,"" says Riccardo Fino, winemaker and President of the Riomaggiore Vintners Association.""The Cinque Terre National Park has recognized the problem and has earmarked resources specifically for the dry stone walls.  But even with those, and other funds that arrive from the EU for rural development, it’s just not enough for this monumental task.  The future of the Cinque Terre is in the hands of those who are able to assist us.” While increasingly violent storms with unprecedented rainfall are a huge threat to the integrity of the walls, there's another factor that leads to their demise: neglect.  Ancestors of the Cinque Terre built an astonishing 3,560 miles of dry stone retaining walls by hand, thus creating the terraces which provided—and still provide—essential space for agriculture.  In the past, every bit of hillside in the region was cultivated, primarily with vineyards but also with olive and lemon groves. This was a community of farmers. If you look at the hills surrounding the Cinque Terre villages today you can easily see that much of the land has been abandoned.  Rather than crops, the overwhelming majority of the terraces are overgrown with Mediterranean brush, brambles and trees.   In the 1800s over 3,400 acres of land were farmed in the Cinque Terre.  Today the number has dropped to just over 250 acres—a staggering decline.  When these terraces are abandoned and the walls fall into disrepair they will eventually collapse, increasing the risk of landslide exponentially.   Why have so many terraces and walls been abandoned you might wonder?  Farming here is physically demanding and historically it provided a meager income; many locals left behind their agricultural origins in search of easier and more profitable work.  Italians use the term viticoltura eroica (heroic viticulture) to describe winegrowers who work in particularly challenging conditions. This could not be more true than in the Cinque Terre where the centuries-old vineyards are rooted on narrow terraces carved out of the cliffs and steep hillsides. Working the land atop the dry stone walls, which have been pieced together like a giant artisan puzzle without the use of cement or mortar, is not for the faint of heart. Today the heroic winemakers of the Cinque Terre are the true caretakers and guardians of the land.  Their dry stone walls help to maintain balance in this incredibly vulnerable landscape and are absolutely critical to the longevity of the Cinque Terre.   
Without the wine growers, there would be no one to monitor or repair the walls.  
Without the walls, there would be no Cinque Terre.
   The Cinque Terre is aUNESCO World Heritage Site  In addition to their critical role as a support system for the region, these dry stone walls are the very thing that prompted the Cinque Terre to be named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. UNESCO declares this region:""A remarkable cultural landscape created by human endeavor over a millennium in a rugged and dramatic natural landscape.  It represents the harmonious interaction between people and nature to produce a landscape of exceptional quality.""It is imperative that we regard the dry stone walls and the terraces they form as an important part of the world's patrimony and that we protect and maintain them as such.   The Grapes & Heroes Campaign  Inspired by the enduring spirit of farmers in the Cinque Terre, “Grapes & Heroes” began as a photographic project that aimed to explore and document local winemakers' specific challenges, hopes and success stories. The project has evolved into this crowdfunding campaign to assist a group of Cinque Terre winemakers in their wall building quest. 
The goal of this crowdfunding campaign is to offset the winemakers' ongoing and ever-increasing costs associated with building and maintaining the dry stone walls.  
Although some public funding is available (and appreciated!) unfortunately it will never be enough.  This campaign aims to fill the gap between those funds and the actual wall building costs incurred by the winemakers.  
Your contribution, no matter the size, will make a difference. 
   Let's crunch some numbersBecause the terraces on which the vineyards are located are narrow and steep and in such rugged and remote locations, the most cost-effective way to deliver rocks for building the walls is by helicopter.  But helicopters charge by the minute and with the clock ticking, costs soar.  It's no surprise that building and maintaining the walls is a financial burden on the Cinque Terre winemakers, who are defined as micro agricultural enterprises meaning they have equally small resources.    You can MAKE A DIFFERENCEThis is your chance to be involved, firsthand, in the reconstruction of the dry stone walls that safeguard the Cinque Terre and make its landscape so unique.  Contribute.  Purchase a perk.  And equally as important, please help us spread the word. There are a whole lot of people who love the Cinque Terre... we could really use your help in reaching them! Like our page on Facebook. Follow us on Instagram. Share the heck out of this INDIEGOGO page.  The more exposure we can get, the more walls we can save!  We have set an initial financial goal that is large, but our secret goal is to raise much, much  more.  Once we've paid expenses like the platform commission and shipping fees, every cent raised will be made available to the winemakers to help offset the costs of maintaining their extensive network (we're talking miles and miles) of dry stone walls in the region.  Your participation and support for this campaign will help ensure that the Cinque Terre is here for generations to come.Grazie mille! #savethewalls5terre #nowallsno5terre  The WinemakersFunds raised in this campaign will be divided between four winemakers, all based within the municipality of Riomaggiore (which encompasses the villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Volastra and Groppo).  Collectively the four winemakers cultivate 15 acres of land, produce 27,400 bottles of Cinque Terre wine per year and maintain miles and miles of dry stone walls.

 The Cinque Terre's traditional heritage wine is a dry white wine made with three varieties of grapes: Bosco, Albarolo and Vermentino.   These grapes are grown in vineyards within the national park, surrounding the villages of Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso.  Because production is limited due to obvious geographical restrictions,  Cinque Terre wine is difficult to find outside of this area.  As described in Bella Vita Travels, ""The dry white wine is a straw colored, light bodied wine. Its main characteristics are its fresh acidic bite and interesting minerality. Within the glass, you can smell aromas of the surrounding lemon trees and wild herbs. You can vaguely taste a salinity from the craggy rocks in which the roots grow and the salt air surrounding the plants."" All bottles purchased through the Grapes & Heroes crowdfunding campaign will arrive signed by the winemaker...  making them truly special!     The pride of the Cinque Terre is its sweet, amber-colored Sciacchetrà dessert wine (pronounced shock-keh-trah). Why is Sciacchetrà so expensive?  In order to make just one bottle of this sweet wine, an astonishing 45 pounds of fresh grapes are required (these grapes are left to wither to 15 pounds of partially dried ones before being pressed).  During the harvest, winemakers identify the highest quality grapes in their vineyards.  Before choosing them, the sugar content of each individual cluster must be measured to determine if it falls within a specific range.  If the cluster passes this test, it will be cut and hung to dry in a cellar for up to 40 days.  In November it is common to see locals gathered in the cantinas for hours upon end.  What are they doing you might ask? They are removing each partially dried grape from the stem by hand!  Sciacchetrà should age for at least 6 years but good vintages can age 10, 20, even 30 years!  Production is extremely limited which also explains why it is considered precious to locals. It's tradition to open a bottle for special occasions like weddings, baptisms and first communions. Oftentimes when a child is born in the Cinque Terre, a bottle of Sciacchetrà is kept in reserve and only opened on the child's 18th birthday!Fine print: For those residing within the U.S., only persons over the age of 21 will be permitted to choose vouchers for perks including alcohol (in other countries it will be the minimum drinking age allowed by law).  Once you are emailed your voucher, you will be instructed on how to redeem your wine.

Early evening is aperitivo time!  This is one of my favorite Italian traditions where everyone heads out to unwind, catch up, have a drink and a snack and prime their bellies for dinner!  We will decide together what you would like to see and do. I will plan our adventures based on your interests.  If we are able to coordinate schedules, there is also the possibility joining Riccardo and traveling by car to see his vineyards and dry stone walls.  A unique opportunity to see and hike in parts of the Cinque Terre restricted to winemakers.   You are on your own during the evenings, but I am happy to make recommendations or reservations.Fine print: Please note that the timing for this tour must be mutually agreed upon.  Karin travels to Italy at least four times a year.  If you'd like to use this perk in 2020 it will need to be booked immediately before or after one of her already booked trips.  Available windows of time in 2020 are April 24-30, July 4-10, October 2-9 or October 27-November 9.  She might be able to accommodate another date in 2020 if you are willing to incur the additional cost of her plane ticket.  Her 2021 trips are not yet scheduled so she is super flexible with dates if you'd like to purchase the perk and use it in 2021. You will be required to sign a waiver before participating. 9-Night Sciacchetrà & Dry Stone Wall Experience 9-night Sciacchetrà & Wall Experience for 1 person with Claudia Cappo and the winemakers who produce I Magnati wines (€2,900, 2 offered) Live like a local for 9 nights in Riomaggiore!  Each fall the cantinas in the Cinque Terre are abuzz with activity.  It's a very important time of year as it is when the region’s specialty wine, Sciacchetrà, is made.  If you peek into any cantina you will see locals gathered, sitting on stools with a bucket in front of them, removing grapes from their stems one by one.  It's a real community effort.  While you are here, you'll get to help!  I will meet you at the train station when you arrive and walk you to your apartment.  After settling in, I will show you around the village and bring you to a local bar for an aperitivo.  You will be here for 9-nights, which is long enough to really get a feel for what it's like to live in the village. We will have 2-3 days in the cantina helping to make Sciacchetrà and 2 days (weather permitting) in the hills helping winemakers Riccardo and Davide rebuild collapsed walls. You will also have several free days to explore the region on your own.  Of course, I am happy to offer suggestions!  This is a unique and once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  I once asked Riccardo why he did not acquire more land in order to produce larger quantities of wine. He answered me with a profound statement that I could only truly understand after working alongside him for several weeks: “I only have two hands.” Join me for 9 nights as we will serve as extra sets of hands for the winemakers.  Accommodations for 9 nights are included, as is the welcome aperitivo.  I will treat you to coffee on the mornings that we work together and a sack lunch will be provided during cantina and wall maintenance days.  Dates must be somewhat flexible... the exact time will depend on the weather (which impacts the timing of the harvest).  The window of time is usually the end of October through early November.  Fine print: Within 2 weeks from the end of the campaign you will receive an email with Claudia's contact information.  Together you will determine a mutually agreeable time to redeem this perk. Perk must be redeemed in 2020.  You will be required to sign a waiver before participating.",29.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Story So Far...</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We ran the first Ruckus Retreat last year, after seeing a gap in creative events being offered. The way we saw it, </span>these events were either:</p>
<p>- too short</p>
<p>- too focused on listening quietly to panels rather than actually creating</p>
<p>- or too expensive </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ruckus Retreat's aim is to change that with a 4-day event that is<strong> interactive, community-driven, and affordable.</strong> </p>
<p>The retreat comprises of 4 main types of session:</p>
<p>- <strong>Workshops/discussion</strong> sessions around a wide range of creative disciplines</p>
<p>- <strong>Personalised feedback groups</strong> based on what feedback will be useful to you specifically</p>
<p>-<strong> Evening activities</strong>, including an open mic</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Lat year was an incredible success - with <strong>100% of attendees saying in an anonymous feedback survey that they would attend again and recommend it to a friend.</strong> </p>
<p> </p>

<h3><strong>The long version</strong></h3>
<p>We're organizing buyouts of Crazy Rich Asians and donating tickets to community organizations such as Big Brothers Big Sister.  This is similar to what was done by the African-American community for the launch of ""Black Panther.""</p>
<p>It's the first US movie in 20 years with an all Asian cast.  Growing up, it was rare to see people that look like us on screen.  Now we have the chance to give that opportunity to the next generation and tell Hollywood representation means business!</p>
<p>You don't have to be Asian or Crazy Rich to join. In fact, diversity is the whole point. So show some love! <i>Let's buy out a theatre (or two), get this movie a #goldopen, and donate the tickets so young people can see themselves in a story!</i></p>

<p><br/>(We're the MAFIA!)</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It’s a simple plan: buy out showings and donate the tickets to community organizations.  But maybe you're worried about...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>What if the movie is terrible?</strong> Nope, it's <u><a href=""https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/crazy_rich_asians/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CERTIFIED FRESH</a></u> on Rotten Tomatoes - currently at a very fresh 93%.</li>
<li>
<strong>What if you run away with the money?</strong> We'll send all supporters receipts of how the money was spent.  If there's any money left at the end, we'll donate it to a local nonprofit.</li>
<li>
<strong>Am I just supporting a movie studio?</strong> You can think about it that way... or you can think about it as giving kids the gift of seeing themselves on screen for the first time and voting for diversity with your dollars!  We want to show the movie industry representation means BUSINESS!</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't sponsor a ticket right now? We understand - there are other ways to help:</p>

</div></div>","UPDATE: Whoa, we funded this theater in just 2 days!  Thank you for being so insanely generous. Let's try for one more theater and send some more kids to see themselves on screen.  Each theater costs about $1500.  Let's do it!

The short version

Raise $ to buyout a theater (~$1,500 per theater or ~88 seats at $17 per seat.)
Donate the tickets to organizations such as Big Brothers Big Sister

Kids and their guardians get to go on a crazy rich movie-going adventure to see themselves on screen for the first time

​The more money we raise, the more theaters we can buy out, and the more kids can see this movie!  
The long version
We're organizing buyouts of Crazy Rich Asians and donating tickets to community organizations such as Big Brothers Big Sister.  This is similar to what was done by the African-American community for the launch of ""Black Panther.""
It's the first US movie in 20 years with an all Asian cast.  Growing up, it was rare to see people that look like us on screen.  Now we have the chance to give that opportunity to the next generation and tell Hollywood representation means business!
You don't have to be Asian or Crazy Rich to join. In fact, diversity is the whole point. So show some love! Let's buy out a theatre (or two), get this movie a #goldopen, and donate the tickets so young people can see themselves in a story!

<3  From Big Brothers Big Sisters NYC

We need crazy collaborators.
Donate some cash-o-la to this. All of the funds go towards buying out the theatre. 

Sponsor one ticket or a few!  
Spam the company-wide email list and tell your coworkers to join you!
Post it on Facebook so your mom and aunties will see!

But really though, anything will help.


 
Why Participate?
Stephanie Foo in her Vox article said it best:
""It was a little surprising for me to burst into tears 10 minutes into the movie. I understood the power of story and of representation in media. But I couldn't have predicted how impactful seeing my story onscreen would be...""
 
And Director Jon Chu:
""Crazy Rich Asians is more than just a movie, it's a movement.""
 
And Bing Chen follows with...:
""EVERY MOVEMENT NEEDS ITS MAFIA.""

(We're the MAFIA!)
Risks & Challenges
It’s a simple plan: buy out showings and donate the tickets to community organizations.  But maybe you're worried about...


What if the movie is terrible? Nope, it's CERTIFIED FRESH on Rotten Tomatoes - currently at a very fresh 93%.

What if you run away with the money? We'll send all supporters receipts of how the money was spent.  If there's any money left at the end, we'll donate it to a local nonprofit.

Am I just supporting a movie studio? You can think about it that way... or you can think about it as giving kids the gift of seeing themselves on screen for the first time and voting for diversity with your dollars!  We want to show the movie industry representation means BUSINESS!


Other Ways You Can Help
Can't sponsor a ticket right now? We understand - there are other ways to help:

Send this campaign to your company mailing list!  Large companies usually have interest groups that would love to help. 
Share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and email.
Help us organize the event (Slide into our DM)


 
Who are you & why are you doing this?
No, we don't work for Warner Brothers.  We're just big believers in representation and the power of media to shape the national conversation.

Fast-forward to today, where this monumental project is just one crucial step away from completion.We at the National Trust for Historic Preservation, in collaboration with Heineken USA and Union Station Redevelopment Corporation, are on a mission to help complete Union Station's restoration by repairing four of the station’s 46 legionnaire statues. With your support, we’ll be closer than ever to returning Union Station to its full historic grandeur.Designed by legendary architect Daniel Burnham, Union Station is a masterpiece that set the standard for monumental Washington as we know it. When it was completed in 1908, Union Station covered more ground than any other building in the country and was the largest train station in the world. In fact, the building is so vast that the Washington Monument could lie entirely on its side within the station’s concourse!Over the years, the historic Main Hall underwent drastic changes as the popularity of rail travel ebbed and flowed, chipping away at the architect’s original vision of a unique open environment. At one point, a circular, two-story cafe was added smack in the middle of the Main Hall, making it hard to appreciate the station in all its glory.Recently, however, that all changed.Five years ago, the Union Station Redevelopment Corporation started turning back the hands of time to return the Main Hall to its heyday. Today, for the first time since the 1970s, the jaw-dropping room is revamped and 100% unobstructed. The dramatic 96-foot ceiling has also been brought back to life, thanks to 120,000 sheets of new gold leafing. It’s a new day for this very old place, but one final piece of this legendary puzzle needs help to be completed.Every year, nearly 40 million visitors pass under the watchful eyes of 46 carved soldiers perched throughout the station. Commissioned in 1905, these imposing Roman-style legionnaires were meant to symbolize the number of States in the Union at the time of the station's opening in 1907.While they have guarded Union Station well for over 100 years, today they’re in need of a little TLC. That’s where you come in.Success! We're happy to report that our campaign raised $41,429! That's $26,429 above our original goal of $15,000!Thanks to the generous support of our backers, we'll soon kick-start the repair of the station’s legionnaires by funding an important pilot restoration of the four statues that stand over the entrance to the West Hall.Please stay tuned to the updates section of this page for additional project news.I claimed tickets to the Bruno Mars: 24K Magic World Tour as my perk and have questions. Thank you for supporting our project! You will find answers to your questions in our FAQ. If you have specific questions about how to redeem your tickets, please email fulfillment@lifeinmobile.com.

<p>My name is Byb Chanel Bibene; I am the Artistic Director of Mbongui Square Festival. I am originally from the Republic of Congo, central Africa. I found my new homes in San Francisco and Oakland. The Bay Area has been such a welcoming place where I have been able to express my artistic vision in dance and choreography by leading multiple dance productions that the art community has supported throughout the past seven years. And I am grateful for the many opportunities that the Bay Area arts scene has offered. </p>
<p>Creating Mbongui Square Square has been my contribution to reinforce and promote the integration of communities in the Bay by encouraging multidisciplinary arts. The Bay Area is a place that perpetually seeks for social equity,  justice, and cultural diversity. Mbongui Square Festival reinforces this vision of a society that coalesces through the art of dance, music, spoken word, and visual arts. </p>
<p>However, to make such a platform possible is the reason why, we the Mbongui staff, are asking for your financial support. Our goal is to raise $4,000. This amount will help us afford theater rental, studio rental for rehearsals, and accommodate our guest artists traveling from France, Germany and North Carolina. Your contribution will assure a successful festival, a growing number of ethnically diverse audience, an international artistic input via the talent of our guest artists, and the interconnectedness of the artists and the audience that represent the colors the Bay Area is made.   </p>
<p>As an acknowledgment of your contribution, we engage our effort to offer different packages that are comprised of the festival t-shirts, artistic hand made Africa-fabrics, cultural ornament for your gifts, a DVD of the festival, a CD with selection of soulful music, a particular seat in the theater, organic food and beverages, professional quality performances, and lots of fun.</p>
<p>By contributing, you participate in our endeavors to enrich and transform our Bay Area by keeping it an inspiring, informative, healing, transformative, and welcoming place. By contributing, you play a tremendous role in the emergence and discovery of new talents in dance, music, spoken word, and visual arts.  </p>
<p>One of the successes of Mbongui Square Festival is the projects collaborations between the Bay artists and our international guests allowing then a cross Atlantic representation of the Bay talent.</p>
<p>Our biggest obstacle in organizing Mbongui Square Festival is facing the unpredictable, that come in either the difficulty for our international guests to get visas, our non-local incapacity to afford air fares, or last minute withdrawals of artists. However, with the financial and moral and physical support of our friends in the community, we lay strategies to overcome these difficulties.  </p>
<p>Ways you can help us produce a successful festival is to either make a financial contribution, or promote the festival by sharing this campaign, spreading the word, or by volunteering during the festival. </p>

<h3>What We Imagine</h3>
<p><strong>Feast World Kitchen will be a downtown restaurant (3rd &amp; Cedar) for Spokane's immigrant and former refugee community to share their culture through excellent international cuisine.</strong> We hope to showcase food from several continents: a different style of cuisine for each night Feast is open -- for both walk-up and order-ahead customers! We may start with takeout, but eventually our dining room will be a hub for cross-cultural community. Feast will be a place for empowerment and small business training. It will be a place for friendship. It will be a place for fun cooking classes and private events... even food truck rallies and fundraisers! If we have space, it will also be a home-base commissary kitchen for caterers and food trucks who want to rent some prep space (generating some self-sustaining revenue). This is what we imagine. Let's make it a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Our goal is to create an incubator kitchen and community gathering space</strong>, which will feature a rotating group of immigrant and former-refugee chefs. Amazing international cuisine, available several nights a week on a rotating basis! Hypothetical Example: Wednesday is Middle Eastern / Mediterranean, Thursday is Inland Curry, Friday is Senegalese (West African), and so on...</p>
<p><strong>All the while, our chefs will have a chance to start their own food businesses and make connections in the community,</strong> building their own brands through private catering gigs when it isn't their own featured night. Feast World Kitchen will provide a platform for exposure that will allow them to make vital income for their families. Our chefs will be purchasing their own ingredients and renting their time in the kitchen (at very reasonable rates), so they are full partners in this effort -- they don't want handouts, but they could use a hand up. To that end, Feast will help navigate the permitting processes, provide some startup funding, and hook chefs up with optimal small business training, so they can begin building a local food presence to share their culture -- without the barriers of major financial risk or trying to navigate the long, difficult road to success on one's own.</p>
<h3>The Back Story: A Community Effort... to Build Community</h3>
<p>In the past few years, Dan Todd and Ross Carper have been walking parallel paths. Dan launched <a href=""http://inlandcurry.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Inland Curry</a>, a weekly pop-up carryout spot at 9th &amp; Walnut (operates out of the Woman's Club). A couple blocks away at 10th &amp; Maple, Ross rolled out <a href=""https://www.thecompassbreakfastwagon.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Compass Breakfast Wagon</a>. Both live just a few blocks from the places they serve food to neighbors. And both have been greatly blessed by friendships with former refugees in Spokane -- Dan through hosting a successful monthly refugee-chef dinner series, and Ross through his work at First Presbyterian Church (FPC), helping organize World Relief ""Good Neighbor Teams"" and befriending international kids and families on the lower south hill. FPC has a long history of befriending immigrant neighbors, including The Barton School, a free ELL program beginning its 51st schoolyear.</p>
<p>When the former Arctic Circle / Sushi Yama building came available and FPC purchased it as an investment (both financially and as a way to impact the good of the neighborhood), Dan and Ross saw an opportunity. They began exploring (with several other neighbors) the idea of taking a big leap: forming a new nonprofit that combines their love of food and cross-cultural friendship. Maisa Abudayha joined the conversation and began taking on new leadership opportunities. Over the summer, she used Ross's food trailer to serve awesome Jordanian food as a pilot project, cooked as a sub at Inland Curry, and served in leadership with Feast's newly forming group of international chefs. A board was formed that includes friends with tons of wisdom. Papers were filed.</p>
<p>And so, after months of conversation, dreaming, planning, and action -- and FPC's generous offer to rent the building at a discounted rate -- <strong>Feast World Kitchen is being born into the world this fall</strong>. And we think it's going to be a beautiful baby! But we need lots of ""midwives"" (YOU) for this project to come to life :).</p>
<p><strong>Will you join our circle of neighbors, who aim to create a new space for food, friendship, and empowerment?</strong></p>
<p>In addition to Dan and Ross, included in Feast's board and core group of partners/advisors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sajda Nelson, former refugee from Iraq who works as <a href=""https://worldreliefspokane.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">World Relief</a>'s Friendship Center Coordinator</li>
<li>Luke Baumgarten, co-founder of Spokane arts nonprofit <a href=""https://www.terrainspokane.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Terrain</a>
</li>
<li>Beth Killian, licensed mental health counselor</li>
<li>Matt Goldbloom, neighborhood/nonprofit organizer</li>
<li>Maisa Abudayha, former asylum-seeker from Jordan, Mediterranean chef</li>
<li>Tony Epefanio, president of Greater Spokane Food Truck Association</li>
<li>Pingala Dhital, Bhutanese chef and World Relief staff member</li>
<li>First Presbyterian Church Spokane, our gracious landlord</li>
<li>The Smith-Barbieri Progressive Fund, generously serving as fiscal agent and startup partner as we get rolling.</li>
<li>Treatment, a local creative firm, offering up their branding/design/photo/video expertise!</li>
<li>...and a network of great cooks from places like Bhutan, Senegal, Syria, Iraq, Mexico, Afghanistan, Jordan, Ghana, and more! We'll be introducing these folks individually as we go!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Feast Collective (our nonprofit name) holds the following vision and mission. </strong>These dreams will only come to life through your support!</p>
<p><strong>Vision: </strong>We will be satisfied only when all former refugees and immigrants<br/>living in the Spokane area have experienced welcome and inclusion and are<br/>flourishing, as full, active community members.<br/><br/><strong>Mission:</strong> Feast Collective will celebrate and empower immigrants and former<br/>refugees and reduce community tensions through education, story-telling and meaningful<br/>cultural exchanges.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>There are many, many needs</strong> related to operating a new nonprofit that is also a business incubator and functioning restaurant! We are currently hoping to receive lots of ""sweat equity"" help and raise at least $25,000, which will support:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Many licensing and permitting fees </strong>and processes already in progress, both for Feast World Kitchen itself and to assist on the individual business and catering licenses for each chef, so they can eventually function independently, taking on catering jobs of their own and, if they choose, blossoming into their own restaurants, catering companies, or food trucks.</li>
<li>
<strong>Transformation of our well-worn building into a clean, fully functioning, up-to-date commercial kitchen... </strong>We're going to be honest: it has lots of equipment that works and ""good bones"" but this old burger/shake joint turned sushi spot needs some serious work. But we can see its potential: first for takeout on limited evenings, and ASAP: we will be finishing off attractive, comfortable indoor and outdoor dining areas for people to linger and enjoy the flavors together!</li>
<li>
<strong>Bringing on our Executive Director </strong>(Daniel Todd of Inland Curry) and hopefully an administrative specialist in staff roles.</li>
<li>
<strong>Special extras </strong>like transforming the former Sushi Yama front counter into a massive professional chef's table that will host many fun cooking classes and special gatherings!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>By donating toward these needs, you'll get some great perks,</strong> but the biggest perk is the positive impact you will have on our city's culture.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>By contributing your time, talents, and funds to Feast, you are making a statement. We believe </strong>former refugees and immigrants in Spokane should be met with love, hospitality, celebration, friendship, opportunity, and shared cultural learning and understanding. We don't believe they should be met with fear, racism, bigotry, scapegoating, and suspicion. Feast World Kitchen creates a needed space for the former, as we try to do our part to dismantle the latter.</p>
<p><strong>Help us:</strong></p>

</div></div>","What We Imagine
Feast World Kitchen will be a downtown restaurant (3rd & Cedar) for Spokane's immigrant and former refugee community to share their culture through excellent international cuisine. We hope to showcase food from several continents: a different style of cuisine for each night Feast is open -- for both walk-up and order-ahead customers! We may start with takeout, but eventually our dining room will be a hub for cross-cultural community. Feast will be a place for empowerment and small business training. It will be a place for friendship. It will be a place for fun cooking classes and private events... even food truck rallies and fundraisers! If we have space, it will also be a home-base commissary kitchen for caterers and food trucks who want to rent some prep space (generating some self-sustaining revenue). This is what we imagine. Let's make it a reality.
Our goal is to create an incubator kitchen and community gathering space, which will feature a rotating group of immigrant and former-refugee chefs. Amazing international cuisine, available several nights a week on a rotating basis! Hypothetical Example: Wednesday is Middle Eastern / Mediterranean, Thursday is Inland Curry, Friday is Senegalese (West African), and so on...
All the while, our chefs will have a chance to start their own food businesses and make connections in the community, building their own brands through private catering gigs when it isn't their own featured night. Feast World Kitchen will provide a platform for exposure that will allow them to make vital income for their families. Our chefs will be purchasing their own ingredients and renting their time in the kitchen (at very reasonable rates), so they are full partners in this effort -- they don't want handouts, but they could use a hand up. To that end, Feast will help navigate the permitting processes, provide some startup funding, and hook chefs up with optimal small business training, so they can begin building a local food presence to share their culture -- without the barriers of major financial risk or trying to navigate the long, difficult road to success on one's own.
The Back Story: A Community Effort... to Build Community
In the past few years, Dan Todd and Ross Carper have been walking parallel paths. Dan launched Inland Curry, a weekly pop-up carryout spot at 9th & Walnut (operates out of the Woman's Club). A couple blocks away at 10th & Maple, Ross rolled out The Compass Breakfast Wagon. Both live just a few blocks from the places they serve food to neighbors. And both have been greatly blessed by friendships with former refugees in Spokane -- Dan through hosting a successful monthly refugee-chef dinner series, and Ross through his work at First Presbyterian Church (FPC), helping organize World Relief ""Good Neighbor Teams"" and befriending international kids and families on the lower south hill. FPC has a long history of befriending immigrant neighbors, including The Barton School, a free ELL program beginning its 51st schoolyear.
When the former Arctic Circle / Sushi Yama building came available and FPC purchased it as an investment (both financially and as a way to impact the good of the neighborhood), Dan and Ross saw an opportunity. They began exploring (with several other neighbors) the idea of taking a big leap: forming a new nonprofit that combines their love of food and cross-cultural friendship. Maisa Abudayha joined the conversation and began taking on new leadership opportunities. Over the summer, she used Ross's food trailer to serve awesome Jordanian food as a pilot project, cooked as a sub at Inland Curry, and served in leadership with Feast's newly forming group of international chefs. A board was formed that includes friends with tons of wisdom. Papers were filed.
And so, after months of conversation, dreaming, planning, and action -- and FPC's generous offer to rent the building at a discounted rate -- Feast World Kitchen is being born into the world this fall. And we think it's going to be a beautiful baby! But we need lots of ""midwives"" (YOU) for this project to come to life :).
Will you join our circle of neighbors, who aim to create a new space for food, friendship, and empowerment?
In addition to Dan and Ross, included in Feast's board and core group of partners/advisors:

Sajda Nelson, former refugee from Iraq who works as World Relief's Friendship Center Coordinator
Luke Baumgarten, co-founder of Spokane arts nonprofit Terrain

Beth Killian, licensed mental health counselor
Matt Goldbloom, neighborhood/nonprofit organizer
Maisa Abudayha, former asylum-seeker from Jordan, Mediterranean chef
Tony Epefanio, president of Greater Spokane Food Truck Association
Pingala Dhital, Bhutanese chef and World Relief staff member
First Presbyterian Church Spokane, our gracious landlord
The Smith-Barbieri Progressive Fund, generously serving as fiscal agent and startup partner as we get rolling.
Treatment, a local creative firm, offering up their branding/design/photo/video expertise!
...and a network of great cooks from places like Bhutan, Senegal, Syria, Iraq, Mexico, Afghanistan, Jordan, Ghana, and more! We'll be introducing these folks individually as we go!

Feast Collective (our nonprofit name) holds the following vision and mission. These dreams will only come to life through your support!
Vision: We will be satisfied only when all former refugees and immigrantsliving in the Spokane area have experienced welcome and inclusion and areflourishing, as full, active community members.Mission: Feast Collective will celebrate and empower immigrants and formerrefugees and reduce community tensions through education, story-telling and meaningfulcultural exchanges.

What We Need & What You Get
There are many, many needs related to operating a new nonprofit that is also a business incubator and functioning restaurant! We are currently hoping to receive lots of ""sweat equity"" help and raise at least $25,000, which will support:


Many licensing and permitting fees and processes already in progress, both for Feast World Kitchen itself and to assist on the individual business and catering licenses for each chef, so they can eventually function independently, taking on catering jobs of their own and, if they choose, blossoming into their own restaurants, catering companies, or food trucks.

Transformation of our well-worn building into a clean, fully functioning, up-to-date commercial kitchen... We're going to be honest: it has lots of equipment that works and ""good bones"" but this old burger/shake joint turned sushi spot needs some serious work. But we can see its potential: first for takeout on limited evenings, and ASAP: we will be finishing off attractive, comfortable indoor and outdoor dining areas for people to linger and enjoy the flavors together!

Bringing on our Executive Director (Daniel Todd of Inland Curry) and hopefully an administrative specialist in staff roles.

Special extras like transforming the former Sushi Yama front counter into a massive professional chef's table that will host many fun cooking classes and special gatherings!

By donating toward these needs, you'll get some great perks, but the biggest perk is the positive impact you will have on our city's culture.

The Impact
By contributing your time, talents, and funds to Feast, you are making a statement. We believe former refugees and immigrants in Spokane should be met with love, hospitality, celebration, friendship, opportunity, and shared cultural learning and understanding. We don't believe they should be met with fear, racism, bigotry, scapegoating, and suspicion. Feast World Kitchen creates a needed space for the former, as we try to do our part to dismantle the latter.
Help us:

Bring the community together joyfully around food, a universal language.
Provide opportunities for flourishing for our neighbors from around the world.
Make Spokane a better, more hospitable (and flavorful!) place.


Risks & Challenges
To be honest, all food-related operations come with risk. They are costly to start and maintain, and profit margins can be tight. However, with an existing restaurant building, low rent rates, and lots of experienced partners and advisors, we believe we can overcome these challenges.
By presenting a compelling story that people want to participate in, and by pursuing excellence and integrity in all aspects -- from our incubator program to our financial transparency to our food quality and safety -- we will succeed. There will be bumps along the way, but Spokane is ready for this. In fact, you're still reading this because perhaps you're ready to participate somehow, too.

<p><a href=""http://sandrinellouquet.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">My name is Sandrine and I am an artist</a>. My work, strongly rooted in the practice of drawing, has been exhibited in numerous contemporary art events in Asia, Europe and the United States including Singapore, Shenzhen and Macao Biennials, Kenpoku Art in Japan, Ke Art center in Shanghai, the ARCO museum in Seoul, the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, and The Mistake Room in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>I am French of Vietnamese origin and I live in Lisbon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After graduating at the Fine Arts School in Nice, I lived in Bordeaux for a few years and then moved to Vietnam, where I stayed for 15 years. That´s where I gave birth to my two gems Kim-Ly and Lou-Andrea, and where I met my partner <a href=""https://ubi-quest.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nico, who writes fabulous game scripts</a>.</p>
<p>In 2019, the four of us decided to come and settle in Lisbon. I received a research grant which enabled me to study simultaneously Portuguese azulejo and Vietnamese mosaic from a historical and psychological angle.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I deeply enjoy the time I spend working alone in my studio but I also like to provoke meetings, discussions and create events. For 20 years I have been organizing exhibitions, concerts, performances and lectures. I launched two art magazines, set up and ran a <a href=""http://salonsaigon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">museum </a>for 3 years, taught art and was a <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Discocactus-121218832268"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VJ</a> for a few years.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>At the start of this project was the need to find a studio in which I could continue to create combined with the desire to once again run a cultural space to share my passion for art with others. But how can I contemplate its stability without losing myself, while remaining true to my tastes and my convictions? As I looked for ways to make the project financially sustainable, I turned towards my long-lasting interest for fine stationery products. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As far as I can remember I have always been fascinated by stationery, ever on the lookout for new textures, sizes, and weights of paper, notebooks, pencils and brushes… When I travel to a new city, a new country, stationery and craft paper workshops are the first places I rush to because I know they may conceal real treasures.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I also look for second-hand booksellers because if a book conveys as much emotion as knowledge, it is even more true for a second-hand book. It conjures up the idea of ​​a transmission of knowledge, not so much exhaustive as flowing from one individual to another; the idea of ​​meeting and sharing but in another way ...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then, my wanderings usually take me to flea markets and museums or galleries ... And if I stay a little longer, I will look for a café whose atmosphere will make me want to come back, settle and work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hence I decided to gather all those things that nourish, soothe and amaze me in a project, both modest yet ambitious, and which above all mirrors me most.</p>

<p>On a micro-scale yes, maybe, because what matters to me, beyond making art and its process accessible, is to show paper differently. I’d like to invite people to reconsider its commodity status and start seeing it as a precious object, carefully manufactured by craftsmen with a unique knowledge and not as something consumable that can be heedlessly wasted. I believe in a reasoned approach to dematerialization and its benefits for the environment. Considering paper from this unusual angle means taking part in one´s own way in this powerful march towards more sustainable practices... And if <i>o Gabinete de Madame Thao</i> may not radically change the world, I hope it will contribute to make it more bearable by offering opportunities to wonder and moments to share.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In order to spread the funding for the project I have divided the objectives of this campaign into 3 levels.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Objective 1: 18 000 euros</strong></p>
<p><strong>This would make the launch of the space possible, but with a reduced activity (workshop, tea room / café, some events or workshops)</strong></p>
<p>This amount will finance:</p>
<p>Legal and company establishment costs (2,035 euros)</p>
<p>3 months deposit for a rent of 850 euros (2,550 euros)</p>
<p>Signage, communication elements (2,500 euros)</p>
<p>Interior design, equipment, furniture (7 500 euros)</p>
<p>Stock of material for the tea room / café, events, workshops activity (1000 euros)</p>
<p>+ Crowdfunding platform commission,  rewards production, shipping costs</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Or </strong></p>
<p><strong>Objective 2 : 22 000 euros (objective 1 + 4 000 euros)</strong></p>
<p><strong>This would allow the launch of the place with all its activities thanks to an additional amount of 4,000 euros.</strong></p>
<p>The additional amount will finance:</p>
<p>The first stock of books and stationery products (3400 euros)</p>
<p>+ Crowdfunding platform commission, rewards production, shipping costs</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Or</strong></p>
<p><strong>Objective 3 : 28 500 euros (objective 2 + 6 500 euros)</strong></p>
<p><strong>This will allow optimistically the launch of the space with all its activities and a starting cash box of 6 000 euros.</strong></p>
<p>This cash box will enable to back up the project over a few months after its launch and participate in</p>
<p>Social charges (150 euros / month)</p>
<p>Accounting fees (150 euros / month)</p>
<p>Rent + charges (1 000 euros / month)</p>
<p>Salary of a sales assistant (630 euros / month)</p>
<p>+ Crowdfunding platform commission, rewards production, shipping costs</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>And if…</strong></p>
<p>objective 3 has been exceeded, the additional funds will enable to give another dimension to the programming by offering a greater choice of quality events animated by local and international artists and speakers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Without you this project will only remain a dream, so I'm counting</strong> <strong> on you!</strong></p>

<p><strong>O que é o Gabinete de Madame Thao?</strong></p>
<p>Um espaço cultural</p>
<p>Um salão de chá / café</p>
<p>Uma livraria multilingue</p>
<p>Uma boutique de produtos excecionais relacionados com papel</p>
<p>Um gabinete de curiosidades</p>
<p>Um estúdio de artista</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Qual será a nossa localização ?</strong></p>
<p>No coração de<strong> Lisboa</strong>, perto do majestoso rio Tejo, entre os bairros históricos de Belém e Alfama.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Quem sou ?</strong></p>
<p>Meu nome é Sandrine e <a href=""http://sandrinellouquet.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sou uma artista plástica</a>. O meu trabalho, fortemente ancorado na prática do desenho, foi exposto em vários eventos de arte contemporânea na Ásia, Europa e Estados Unidos, incluindo as Bienais de Singapura, Shenzhen e Macau, Kenpoku Art no Japão, Ke Art center em Xangai, o museu ARCO em Seul, o Palais de Tokyo em Paris, o Yerba Buena Center for the Arts em San Francisco e The Mistake Room em Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Sou francesa de origem vietnamita e vivo atualmente em Lisboa.</p>
<p>Depois de terminar os meus estudos na Escola de Belas Artes em Nice (França) morei alguns anos em Bordéus e mudei-me para o Vietname, onde morei 15 anos. Foi lá que nasceram as minhas duas filhas maravilhas, Kim-Ly e Lou-Andrea. Foi lá também que conheci o meu companheiro <a href=""http://ubi-quest.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nico, que escreve roteiros de jogos fabulosos.</a></p>
<p>Em 2019, os quatro decidimos vir morar em Lisboa. Tive a oportunidade de obter uma bolsa de investigação para estudar o Azulejo Português e as simbioses com o mosaico vietnamita do ponto de vista histórico e psicológico.</p>
<p>Gosto de trabalhar sozinha no meu estúdio mas também aprecio provocar reuniões, discussões e criar eventos. Há 20 anos que organizo exposições, concertos, performances, conferências. Lancei duas revistas de arte e montei e dirigi um <a href=""http://salonsaigon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Museu</a> durante 3 anos em Ho Chi Minh City.</p>
<p> Já dei aulas de arte, fui <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Discocactus-121218832268"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VJ</a> por alguns anos e também faço <a href=""http://digitalmekong.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">design gráfico.</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Nascimento do projeto</strong></p>
<p>No início deste projeto, a necessidade de encontrar um workshop onde possa continuar a criar e, ao mesmo tempo, a vontade de gerir mais uma vez um espaço cultural onde poderei partilhar a minha paixão com os outros. Mas como posso imaginar a sua sustentabilidade financeira sem me perder, permanecendo fiel aos meus gostos e convicções?</p>
<p>Desde muito jovem gosto de trabalhar com o papel. Sempre em busca de novas texturas, tamanhos e gramagens de papel, cadernos, lápis e pincéis ... quando viajo para uma nova cidade, um novo país, papelarias e fabricas de papel artesanal são os primeiros lugares que exploro porque sei que há verdadeiros tesouros a serem descobertos lá.</p>
<p>Procuro também livreiros de segunda mão, porque se o livro em si é portador de conhecimento e também de emoções, essa qualidade adquire uma dimensão ainda mais profunda no caso dos livros usados. Isso evoca a ideia de uma transmissão de conhecimento, não massivo, mas que circularia de um indivíduo para outro; a ideia de um encontro, de uma partilha, mas noutra dimensão ...</p>
<p>O resto das minhas peregrinações levam-me a inúmeras feiras, velharias,  museus ou galerias ... E se ficar um pouco mais, procuro um café cujo ambiente me dê vontade de voltar e instalar-me para trabalhar.</p>
<p>Resolvi, então, reunir todas essas coisas que me alimentam, me acalmam e me surpreendem em um projeto que é ao mesmo tempo modesto e ambicioso, mas que acima de tudo se assemelha a mim.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>O que vai acontecer lá?</strong></p>
<p>Os visitantes poderão ver e adquirir <strong>obras de artistas contemporâneos </strong>de todo o mundo. Esses artistas, emergentes ou já consagrados, têm em comum o fato de terem feito do papel um de seus materiais favoritos.</p>
<p>Pretendo também agendar <strong>eventos culturais </strong>(conferências sobre temas ligados à arte e às ciências humanas, apresentações de artistas, mini-concertos, projeções de videoarte, curtas metragens, documentários) ainda que <strong>workshops, sessões de artes plásticas e live model</strong> que, em conjunto com a atividade de salão de chá, livraria e papelaria, vão garantir a renda do local.</p>
<p>O <strong>Salão de chá / café</strong> irá oferecer, para além dos cafés e sumos clássicos, uma seleção de chás asiáticos - cada um com uma historinha a descobrir, o ""ca-phe sua da"" (café gelado com leite condensado muito doce, popular no Vietname) e pequenos lanches para compartilhar em um ambiente exótico.</p>
<p>A secção da<strong> livraria multilingue</strong> (principalmente português, francês e inglês) consistirá em livros em segunda mão, incluindo uma seleção de<strong> obras essenciais para artistas e investigadores nas artes e nas ciências humanas.</strong></p>
<p>A área de <strong>papelaria </strong>oferecerá principalmente <strong>papéis artesanais</strong> da Ásia (Índia, Nepal, Vietname, Butão, Japão, Tailândia), México e Portugal, mas também<strong> cadernos, lápis e pincéis</strong>, bem como <strong>itens de presente</strong> relacionados ao papel.</p>
<p>Também será o meu <strong>estúdio</strong> / local de trabalho diário onde os visitantes poderão se quiserem ver e discutir comigo o meu trabalho em curso e a minha <strong>coleção de curiosidades</strong> (objetos rituais recolhidos ou criados por mim); uma maneira de eles <strong>acederem a arte de forma simples e amigável.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>De onde vem o nome “O Gabinete de Madame Thao”?</strong></p>
<p>Artista Plástica de profissão, foi pelos títulos que atribuo às minhas exposições que escolhi este nome o qual traduz a minha paixão pelos gabinetes de curiosidades, o meu gosto pelo misterioso e pelo exótico. Também evoca as minhas origens (Thao é o diminutivo de Thu-Thao, o meu sobrenome vietnamita), e os lugares onde morei (França e Vietname) e onde moro hoje Portugal.</p>
<p>É a  fusão de todas essas influências que vai criar a atmosfera do lugar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Sim, mas este projeto mudará o mundo?</strong></p>
<p>Em uma escala micro talvez porque o que importa para mim, além de tornar a arte e o seu processo mais acessível, é mostrar o papel de maneira diferente; para torná-lo considerado um objeto precioso, cuidadosamente fabricado por pessoas com conhecimentos únicos e não um simples consumível que pode ser desperdiçado no lazer. Acredito em uma abordagem racional da desmaterialização e nos benefícios que isso implica para o planeta. Considerar o papel deste ângulo inusitado é participar à sua maneira nesta grande marcha para o progresso ambiental ... E não conseguindo mudar radicalmente o mundo, espero que o Gabinete de Madame Thao também contribua, graças aos momentos de evasão e partilha a torná-lo mais sustentável.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pronto para me acompanhar nesta nova aventura?</strong></p>
<p>De forma a distribuir o financiamento do projeto, dividi os objetivos desta campanha em 3 níveis.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Objetivo 1: 18.000 euros</strong></p>
<p><strong>Que possibilitaria o lançamento do local, mas com atividade reduzida (estúdio, salão de chá / café, alguns eventos ou workshops)</strong></p>
<p>Este valor será usado para financiar:</p>
<p>Custos jurídicos e de constituição da empresa (2.035 euros)</p>
<p>Caução de 3 meses para uma renda de 850 euros (2.550 euros)</p>
<p>A marca, os elementos de comunicação (2.500 euros)</p>

<p>Stock de material para o salão de chá / eventos e atividade de workshops (1000 euros)</p>
<p>+ Comissão de plataforma de crowdfunding, custos de realização e envio de contrapartidas</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ou</strong></p>
<p><strong>Objetivo 2: 22.000 euros (objetivo 1 + 4.000 euros)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Que permitiria, graças a um montante adicional de 4.000 euros, o lançamento do local com todas as suas atividades.</strong></p>
<p>O valor adicional será usado para financiar:</p>
<p>O primeiro stock de livros e artigos de papelaria (3400 euros)</p>
<p>+ Comissão de plataforma de crowdfunding, custos de realização e envio de contrapartidas</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ou…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Objetivo 3: 28.500 euros (objetivo 2 + 6.500 euros)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Que permitiria o lançamento de toda a atividade com uma tesouraria inicial de 6.000 euros.</strong></p>
<p>Este dinheiro possibilitará apoiar o projeto alguns meses após o seu lançamento e participar aos</p>
<p>Encargos sociais (150 euros / mês)</p>
<p>Encargos com o contabilista (150 euros / mês)</p>
<p>Rendas e encargos (900 euros / mês)</p>
<p>Salário de assistente- vendedor (630 euros / mês)</p>
<p>+ Comissão de plataforma de crowdfunding, custos de realização e envio de contrapartidas</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>E se ... e se ...</strong></p>
<p>Ultrapassado o Objetivo 3, os fundos adicionais permitirão dar uma outra dimensão à programação, oferecendo uma maior escolha de eventos de qualidade animados por artistas e oradores locais e internacionais.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Qu’est-ce que c’est ?</strong></p>
<p>Un espace culturel</p>
<p>Un salon de thé / café</p>
<p>Une librairie multilingue</p>
<p>Une boutique de produits d´exception liés au papier</p>
<p>Un cabinet de curiosités</p>
<p>Un atelier d´artiste</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>O</strong><strong>ù</strong><strong> serons-nous situés ?</strong></p>
<p>Au cœur de<strong> Lisbonne</strong>, Portugal, à proximité du majestueux Tage, entre les quartiers historiques de Belem et d´Alfama.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Qui suis-je ? </strong></p>
<p><a href=""http://sandrinellouquet.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Je m’appelle Sandrine et je suis artiste</a>. Mon travail, fortement ancré dans la pratique du dessin, a été exposé dans de multiples évènements d´art contemporain en Asie, Europe et aux États-Unis parmi lesquels les Biennales de Singapour, Shenzhen et Macao, Kenpoku Art au Japon, Ke Art center à Shanghai, le musée ARCO à Seoul, le palais de Tokyo à Paris, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts à San Francisco, ou encore The Mistake Room à Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Je suis française d´origine vietnamienne et je vis à Lisbonne.</p>
<p>Après avoir fini mes études aux Beaux-Arts de Nice j´ai vécu quelques années à Bordeaux puis je suis partie m´installer au Vietnam, où je suis restée 15 ans. C’est là-bas que sont nées mes deux merveilles, Kim-Ly et Lou-Andrea, là-bas aussi que j’ai rencontré mon compagnon <a href=""http://ubi-quest.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nico, qui écrit des sc</a>é<a href=""http://ubi-quest.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">narios de jeux fabuleux.</a></p>
<p>Et puis l’année dernière, nous avons décidé de venir nous installer tous les 4 à Lisbonne. J´y ai obtenu une bourse de recherche qui m´a permis d´étudier en parallèle l´azulejo portugais et la mosaïque vietnamienne sous un angle à la fois historique et psychologique.</p>
<p>J´aime travailler seule dans mon atelier mais, en contrepartie, j´aime aussi susciter des rencontres, des discussions et créer des événements. Depuis 20 ans j’organise des expositions, des concerts, des performances, des conférences, j’ai lancé deux magazines d´art et mis en place et dirigé pendant 3 ans un <a href=""http://salonsaigon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">musée</a>. J´ai enseigné l´art, été <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Discocactus-121218832268"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VJ</a> pendant quelques années, et <a href=""http://digitalmekong.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">je fais aussi du graphisme</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Naissance du projet</strong></p>
<p>Au départ de ce projet, le besoin de retrouver un atelier dans lequel je puisse continuer à créer et, en même temps, l´envie de gérer à nouveau un lieu culturel où partager ma passion avec les autres. Mais comment envisager sa durabilité financière sans me perdre, en restant fidèle à mes goûts et à mes convictions ?</p>
<p>Depuis mon plus jeune âge je raffole des papeteries. Toujours à l´affût de nouvelles textures, tailles, et grammages de papier, de carnets, crayons et pinceaux… quand je voyage dans une nouvelle ville, un nouveau pays, les papeteries et les ateliers de papiers artisanaux sont les premiers lieux que j´explore car je sais qu´on y découvre de véritables trésors.  </p>
<p>Je cherche aussi les bouquinistes car si le livre en soi est porteur d´émotion autant que de connaissance, cette qualité prend une dimension encore plus profonde dans le cas du livre d´occasion. Celui-ci évoque l´idée d´une transmission du savoir, non pas massive mais qui circulerait d´un individu a l´autre ; l´idée d´une rencontre, un partage mais dans une autre dimension…</p>
<p>La suite de mes pérégrinations me mène généralement dans les brocantes et les musées ou galeries… Et si je reste un peu plus longtemps, je vais chercher un café dont l’ambiance va me donner envie de revenir m´installer pour travailler.</p>
<p>Aussi j’ai décidé de rassembler toutes ces choses qui me nourrissent, m´apaisent et m´émerveillent dans un projet à la fois modeste et ambitieux mais qui surtout me ressemble.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Que va-t-il s y passer ?</strong></p>
<p>Les visiteurs pourront découvrir et acquérir des <strong>œuvres créées par des artistes contemporains</strong> venant des quatre coins du monde. Ces artistes, émergeants ou déjà établis, auront ceci en commun qu´ils ont fait du papier un de leurs matériaux de prédilection.</p>
<p>J´y programmerai des <strong>événements culturels</strong> (conférences sur des thèmes liés à l´art et aux sciences humaines, présentations d´artistes, mini-concerts, projections de vidéo d´art, court-métrages, documentaires) ainsi que des <strong>workshops</strong>, des <strong>cours d´art plastique</strong> et des <strong>séances de modèle vivant</strong> qui, avec l´activité salon de thé, librairie-papeterie assureront les revenus du lieu.</p>
<p>La partie <strong>salon de thé / café </strong>proposera, en plus des cafés et jus classiques, une sélection de thés d´Asie - chacun ayant sa petite histoire à découvrir, des « ca-phe sua da » (le café glace au lait concentré sucré très populaire au Vietnam), et des petites choses à grignoter à partager dans une ambiance exotique.</p>
<p>La partie <strong>librairie multilingue</strong> (principalement portugais, français et anglais) sera composée de livres d´occasion, dont une sélection d´<strong>ouvrages incontournables pour les artistes et les chercheurs en art et sciences humaines.</strong></p>
<p>Le coin <strong>papeterie </strong>proposera principalement des <strong>papiers artisanaux</strong> venant d’Asie (Inde, Népal, Vietnam, Bhutan, Japon, Thaïlande) du Mexique et du Portugal, mais aussi des <strong>carnets, crayons et pinceaux</strong> ainsi que des objets <strong>cadeaux </strong>liés au papier.</p>
<p>Ça sera également mon <strong>atelier</strong> / lieu de travail quotidien ou les visiteurs pourront s´ils le désirent voir et discuter avec moi mon travail <i>in progress </i>et ma <strong>collection de curiosités</strong> (objets rituels collectionnés ou créés par moi-même) ; une façon pour eux d´<strong>accéder à l´art de manière simple et conviviale.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>D´où vient l´appellation « O gabinete de Madame Thao » ?</strong></p>
<p>Artiste de profession, c´est en gardant à l´esprit des titres que je donne à mes expositions que j´ai choisi ce nom qui reflète ma passion pour les cabinets de curiosités, mon goût pour le mystérieux et l´exotisme. Il évoque aussi mes origines (Thao est le diminutif de Thu-Thao, mon prénom vietnamien), les lieux où j’ai vécu (France et Vietnam) et où je vis aujourd´hui (« o gabinete » signifie le cabinet en portugais).</p>
<p>C´est la fusion de toutes ces influences qui va venir créer l´atmosphère du lieu.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Oui mais, est-ce que ce projet va changer le monde ?</strong></p>
<p>A une micro-échelle peut-être car ce qui m´importe, au-delà de rendre l´art et son processus accessible, c´est de donner à voir le papier autrement ; faire qu´il soit considéré comme un objet précieux, fabriqué avec soin par des personnes au savoir unique et non comme un simple consommable que l´on peut gaspiller à loisir. Je crois en une approche raisonnée de la dématérialisation et aux bénéfices que celle-ci implique pour la planète.  Envisager le papier sous cet angle inhabituel, c´est participer à sa manière à cette grande marche vers le progrès environnemental… Et à défaut de changer radicalement le monde, j´espère qu´<i>o Gabinete de Madame Thao </i>contribuera aussi, grâce aux moments d´évasion et de partage qu´il permettra, à le rendre plus supportable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Prêts à m´accompagner dans ma nouvelle aventure ?</strong></p>
<p>Afin d´étaler le financement du projet j’ai décomposé les objectifs de cette campagne en 3 paliers.</p>

A cultural Space
A tea room and Cafe
A multilingual bookstore
A boutique of fine paper related products
A curiosity cabinet
An artist studio
 

 


 
In the heart of Lisbon, Portugal, near the majestic Tagus river, between the historic districts of Belem and Alfama.

 

 

 
My name is Sandrine and I am an artist. My work, strongly rooted in the practice of drawing, has been exhibited in numerous contemporary art events in Asia, Europe and the United States including Singapore, Shenzhen and Macao Biennials, Kenpoku Art in Japan, Ke Art center in Shanghai, the ARCO museum in Seoul, the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, and The Mistake Room in Los Angeles.
I am French of Vietnamese origin and I live in Lisbon.
 
After graduating at the Fine Arts School in Nice, I lived in Bordeaux for a few years and then moved to Vietnam, where I stayed for 15 years. That´s where I gave birth to my two gems Kim-Ly and Lou-Andrea, and where I met my partner Nico, who writes fabulous game scripts.
In 2019, the four of us decided to come and settle in Lisbon. I received a research grant which enabled me to study simultaneously Portuguese azulejo and Vietnamese mosaic from a historical and psychological angle.
 
I deeply enjoy the time I spend working alone in my studio but I also like to provoke meetings, discussions and create events. For 20 years I have been organizing exhibitions, concerts, performances and lectures. I launched two art magazines, set up and ran a museum for 3 years, taught art and was a VJ for a few years.
 


 
At the start of this project was the need to find a studio in which I could continue to create combined with the desire to once again run a cultural space to share my passion for art with others. But how can I contemplate its stability without losing myself, while remaining true to my tastes and my convictions? As I looked for ways to make the project financially sustainable, I turned towards my long-lasting interest for fine stationery products. 
 
As far as I can remember I have always been fascinated by stationery, ever on the lookout for new textures, sizes, and weights of paper, notebooks, pencils and brushes… When I travel to a new city, a new country, stationery and craft paper workshops are the first places I rush to because I know they may conceal real treasures.
 
I also look for second-hand booksellers because if a book conveys as much emotion as knowledge, it is even more true for a second-hand book. It conjures up the idea of ​​a transmission of knowledge, not so much exhaustive as flowing from one individual to another; the idea of ​​meeting and sharing but in another way ...
 
Then, my wanderings usually take me to flea markets and museums or galleries ... And if I stay a little longer, I will look for a café whose atmosphere will make me want to come back, settle and work.
 
Hence I decided to gather all those things that nourish, soothe and amaze me in a project, both modest yet ambitious, and which above all mirrors me most.
 

 

 
Visitors will be able to discover and acquire artworks created by contemporary artists from all over the world. These artists, either emerging or already established, will all share their same favorite medium, paper.
 

 

 
I will schedule cultural events (lectures on themes related to art and human sciences, artist talks, mini-concerts, video art, short films and documentaries screenings) as well as workshops, art courses and live model sessions which will ensure the income of the place together with the tea room, the bookshop and the sale of stationery products.
 

 

 
The tea room / café section will provide, in addition to classic coffees and juices, a selection of Asian teas - each with its own little story to discover, “ca-phe sua da” (the Vietnamese ice coffee with sweet condensed milk), and snacks to share in an exotic atmosphere.
 

 

 
The multilingual bookstore section (mainly Portuguese, French and English) will consist of second-hand books, including a selection of essential works for artists and researchers in art and human sciences.
 

 

 
The stationery corner will mainly display artisanal papers from Asia (India, Nepal, Vietnam, Bhutan, Japan, Thailand), Mexico and Portugal, but also notebooks, pencils and brushes as well as paper-related gift items.
 

 

 
It will also be my daily studio where I will gladly welcome visitors to see and discuss my work in progress and my collection of curiosities (ritual objects collected or created by myself); a way for them to access to art in a simple and friendly way.
 


 



 
As a professional artist, I have chosen this name keeping in mind the titles I give to my exhibitions. While reflecting my passion for curiosity cabinets, my taste for the mysterious and for exoticism, it also refers to my origins (Thao is the diminutive of Thu-Thao, my Vietnamese name), the places where I used to live (France and Vietnam) and where I live today (“o gabinete” means the cabinet in Portuguese).
All these influences will mingle to create the atmosphere of the space.
 


 

 
On a micro-scale yes, maybe, because what matters to me, beyond making art and its process accessible, is to show paper differently. I’d like to invite people to reconsider its commodity status and start seeing it as a precious object, carefully manufactured by craftsmen with a unique knowledge and not as something consumable that can be heedlessly wasted. I believe in a reasoned approach to dematerialization and its benefits for the environment. Considering paper from this unusual angle means taking part in one´s own way in this powerful march towards more sustainable practices... And if o Gabinete de Madame Thao may not radically change the world, I hope it will contribute to make it more bearable by offering opportunities to wonder and moments to share.
 

 
In order to spread the funding for the project I have divided the objectives of this campaign into 3 levels.
 
Objective 1: 18 000 euros
This would make the launch of the space possible, but with a reduced activity (workshop, tea room / café, some events or workshops)
This amount will finance:
Legal and company establishment costs (2,035 euros)
3 months deposit for a rent of 850 euros (2,550 euros)
Signage, communication elements (2,500 euros)
Interior design, equipment, furniture (7 500 euros)
Stock of material for the tea room / café, events, workshops activity (1000 euros)
+ Crowdfunding platform commission,  rewards production, shipping costs
 
Or 
Objective 2 : 22 000 euros (objective 1 + 4 000 euros)
This would allow the launch of the place with all its activities thanks to an additional amount of 4,000 euros.
The additional amount will finance:
The first stock of books and stationery products (3400 euros)
+ Crowdfunding platform commission, rewards production, shipping costs
 
Or
Objective 3 : 28 500 euros (objective 2 + 6 500 euros)
This will allow optimistically the launch of the space with all its activities and a starting cash box of 6 000 euros.
This cash box will enable to back up the project over a few months after its launch and participate in
Social charges (150 euros / month)
Accounting fees (150 euros / month)
Rent + charges (1 000 euros / month)
Salary of a sales assistant (630 euros / month)
+ Crowdfunding platform commission, rewards production, shipping costs
 
And if…
objective 3 has been exceeded, the additional funds will enable to give another dimension to the programming by offering a greater choice of quality events animated by local and international artists and speakers.
 
Without you this project will only remain a dream, so I'm counting  on you!
 

 
As a reward, I offer limited reproductions of my artworks and the opportunity to acquire originals for the most generous ;-) Please contact me if you wish you receive a pdf with large images of all the perks.
For 10 euros and more: the reproduction on a postcard, signed, of ""The Invisible Worm That Flies in the Night"" (a drawing I made last year)

For 35 euros and more: a catalog compiling a selection of my drawings made over the last ten years, dedicated and signed

For 75 euros and more: your social media ID profile portrait
For 100 euros and more: a reproduction of ""Entering the Ruins of the Motley Cow"" (a drawing-watercolor I created in 2014) in limited edition (edition of 100 numbered and signed copies) size A4

O que é o Gabinete de Madame Thao?
Um espaço cultural
Um salão de chá / café
Uma livraria multilingue
Uma boutique de produtos excecionais relacionados com papel
Um gabinete de curiosidades
Um estúdio de artista
 
Qual será a nossa localização ?
No coração de Lisboa, perto do majestoso rio Tejo, entre os bairros históricos de Belém e Alfama.
 
Quem sou ?
Meu nome é Sandrine e sou uma artista plástica. O meu trabalho, fortemente ancorado na prática do desenho, foi exposto em vários eventos de arte contemporânea na Ásia, Europa e Estados Unidos, incluindo as Bienais de Singapura, Shenzhen e Macau, Kenpoku Art no Japão, Ke Art center em Xangai, o museu ARCO em Seul, o Palais de Tokyo em Paris, o Yerba Buena Center for the Arts em San Francisco e The Mistake Room em Los Angeles.
Sou francesa de origem vietnamita e vivo atualmente em Lisboa.
Depois de terminar os meus estudos na Escola de Belas Artes em Nice (França) morei alguns anos em Bordéus e mudei-me para o Vietname, onde morei 15 anos. Foi lá que nasceram as minhas duas filhas maravilhas, Kim-Ly e Lou-Andrea. Foi lá também que conheci o meu companheiro Nico, que escreve roteiros de jogos fabulosos.
Em 2019, os quatro decidimos vir morar em Lisboa. Tive a oportunidade de obter uma bolsa de investigação para estudar o Azulejo Português e as simbioses com o mosaico vietnamita do ponto de vista histórico e psicológico.
Gosto de trabalhar sozinha no meu estúdio mas também aprecio provocar reuniões, discussões e criar eventos. Há 20 anos que organizo exposições, concertos, performances, conferências. Lancei duas revistas de arte e montei e dirigi um Museu durante 3 anos em Ho Chi Minh City.
 Já dei aulas de arte, fui VJ por alguns anos e também faço design gráfico.
 
Nascimento do projeto
No início deste projeto, a necessidade de encontrar um workshop onde possa continuar a criar e, ao mesmo tempo, a vontade de gerir mais uma vez um espaço cultural onde poderei partilhar a minha paixão com os outros. Mas como posso imaginar a sua sustentabilidade financeira sem me perder, permanecendo fiel aos meus gostos e convicções?
Desde muito jovem gosto de trabalhar com o papel. Sempre em busca de novas texturas, tamanhos e gramagens de papel, cadernos, lápis e pincéis ... quando viajo para uma nova cidade, um novo país, papelarias e fabricas de papel artesanal são os primeiros lugares que exploro porque sei que há verdadeiros tesouros a serem descobertos lá.
Procuro também livreiros de segunda mão, porque se o livro em si é portador de conhecimento e também de emoções, essa qualidade adquire uma dimensão ainda mais profunda no caso dos livros usados. Isso evoca a ideia de uma transmissão de conhecimento, não massivo, mas que circularia de um indivíduo para outro; a ideia de um encontro, de uma partilha, mas noutra dimensão ...
O resto das minhas peregrinações levam-me a inúmeras feiras, velharias,  museus ou galerias ... E se ficar um pouco mais, procuro um café cujo ambiente me dê vontade de voltar e instalar-me para trabalhar.
Resolvi, então, reunir todas essas coisas que me alimentam, me acalmam e me surpreendem em um projeto que é ao mesmo tempo modesto e ambicioso, mas que acima de tudo se assemelha a mim.
 
O que vai acontecer lá?
Os visitantes poderão ver e adquirir obras de artistas contemporâneos de todo o mundo. Esses artistas, emergentes ou já consagrados, têm em comum o fato de terem feito do papel um de seus materiais favoritos.
Pretendo também agendar eventos culturais (conferências sobre temas ligados à arte e às ciências humanas, apresentações de artistas, mini-concertos, projeções de videoarte, curtas metragens, documentários) ainda que workshops, sessões de artes plásticas e live model que, em conjunto com a atividade de salão de chá, livraria e papelaria, vão garantir a renda do local.
O Salão de chá / café irá oferecer, para além dos cafés e sumos clássicos, uma seleção de chás asiáticos - cada um com uma historinha a descobrir, o ""ca-phe sua da"" (café gelado com leite condensado muito doce, popular no Vietname) e pequenos lanches para compartilhar em um ambiente exótico.
A secção da livraria multilingue (principalmente português, francês e inglês) consistirá em livros em segunda mão, incluindo uma seleção de obras essenciais para artistas e investigadores nas artes e nas ciências humanas.
A área de papelaria oferecerá principalmente papéis artesanais da Ásia (Índia, Nepal, Vietname, Butão, Japão, Tailândia), México e Portugal, mas também cadernos, lápis e pincéis, bem como itens de presente relacionados ao papel.
Também será o meu estúdio / local de trabalho diário onde os visitantes poderão se quiserem ver e discutir comigo o meu trabalho em curso e a minha coleção de curiosidades (objetos rituais recolhidos ou criados por mim); uma maneira de eles acederem a arte de forma simples e amigável.
 
De onde vem o nome “O Gabinete de Madame Thao”?
Artista Plástica de profissão, foi pelos títulos que atribuo às minhas exposições que escolhi este nome o qual traduz a minha paixão pelos gabinetes de curiosidades, o meu gosto pelo misterioso e pelo exótico. Também evoca as minhas origens (Thao é o diminutivo de Thu-Thao, o meu sobrenome vietnamita), e os lugares onde morei (França e Vietname) e onde moro hoje Portugal.
É a  fusão de todas essas influências que vai criar a atmosfera do lugar.
 
Sim, mas este projeto mudará o mundo?
Em uma escala micro talvez porque o que importa para mim, além de tornar a arte e o seu processo mais acessível, é mostrar o papel de maneira diferente; para torná-lo considerado um objeto precioso, cuidadosamente fabricado por pessoas com conhecimentos únicos e não um simples consumível que pode ser desperdiçado no lazer. Acredito em uma abordagem racional da desmaterialização e nos benefícios que isso implica para o planeta. Considerar o papel deste ângulo inusitado é participar à sua maneira nesta grande marcha para o progresso ambiental ... E não conseguindo mudar radicalmente o mundo, espero que o Gabinete de Madame Thao também contribua, graças aos momentos de evasão e partilha a torná-lo mais sustentável.
 
Pronto para me acompanhar nesta nova aventura?
De forma a distribuir o financiamento do projeto, dividi os objetivos desta campanha em 3 níveis.
 
Objetivo 1: 18.000 euros
Que possibilitaria o lançamento do local, mas com atividade reduzida (estúdio, salão de chá / café, alguns eventos ou workshops)
Este valor será usado para financiar:
Custos jurídicos e de constituição da empresa (2.035 euros)
Caução de 3 meses para uma renda de 850 euros (2.550 euros)
A marca, os elementos de comunicação (2.500 euros)
Renovação e decoração de interior compra de equipamentos, mobiliário (7.500 euros)
Stock de material para o salão de chá / eventos e atividade de workshops (1000 euros)
+ Comissão de plataforma de crowdfunding, custos de realização e envio de contrapartidas
 
Ou
Objetivo 2: 22.000 euros (objetivo 1 + 4.000 euros)
Que permitiria, graças a um montante adicional de 4.000 euros, o lançamento do local com todas as suas atividades.
O valor adicional será usado para financiar:
O primeiro stock de livros e artigos de papelaria (3400 euros)
+ Comissão de plataforma de crowdfunding, custos de realização e envio de contrapartidas
 
Ou…
Objetivo 3: 28.500 euros (objetivo 2 + 6.500 euros)
Que permitiria o lançamento de toda a atividade com uma tesouraria inicial de 6.000 euros.
Este dinheiro possibilitará apoiar o projeto alguns meses após o seu lançamento e participar aos
Encargos sociais (150 euros / mês)

Rendas e encargos (900 euros / mês)
Salário de assistente- vendedor (630 euros / mês)

E se ... e se ...
Ultrapassado o Objetivo 3, os fundos adicionais permitirão dar uma outra dimensão à programação, oferecendo uma maior escolha de eventos de qualidade animados por artistas e oradores locais e internacionais.
 
Sem a sua colaboração este projeto será apenas um sonho, pelo que conto consigo!

Qu’est-ce que c’est ?
Un espace culturel
Un salon de thé / café
Une librairie multilingue
Une boutique de produits d´exception liés au papier
Un cabinet de curiosités
Un atelier d´artiste
 
Où serons-nous situés ?
Au cœur de Lisbonne, Portugal, à proximité du majestueux Tage, entre les quartiers historiques de Belem et d´Alfama.
 
Qui suis-je ? 
Je m’appelle Sandrine et je suis artiste. Mon travail, fortement ancré dans la pratique du dessin, a été exposé dans de multiples évènements d´art contemporain en Asie, Europe et aux États-Unis parmi lesquels les Biennales de Singapour, Shenzhen et Macao, Kenpoku Art au Japon, Ke Art center à Shanghai, le musée ARCO à Seoul, le palais de Tokyo à Paris, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts à San Francisco, ou encore The Mistake Room à Los Angeles.
Je suis française d´origine vietnamienne et je vis à Lisbonne.
Après avoir fini mes études aux Beaux-Arts de Nice j´ai vécu quelques années à Bordeaux puis je suis partie m´installer au Vietnam, où je suis restée 15 ans. C’est là-bas que sont nées mes deux merveilles, Kim-Ly et Lou-Andrea, là-bas aussi que j’ai rencontré mon compagnon Nico, qui écrit des scénarios de jeux fabuleux.
Et puis l’année dernière, nous avons décidé de venir nous installer tous les 4 à Lisbonne. J´y ai obtenu une bourse de recherche qui m´a permis d´étudier en parallèle l´azulejo portugais et la mosaïque vietnamienne sous un angle à la fois historique et psychologique.
J´aime travailler seule dans mon atelier mais, en contrepartie, j´aime aussi susciter des rencontres, des discussions et créer des événements. Depuis 20 ans j’organise des expositions, des concerts, des performances, des conférences, j’ai lancé deux magazines d´art et mis en place et dirigé pendant 3 ans un musée. J´ai enseigné l´art, été VJ pendant quelques années, et je fais aussi du graphisme.
 
Naissance du projet
Au départ de ce projet, le besoin de retrouver un atelier dans lequel je puisse continuer à créer et, en même temps, l´envie de gérer à nouveau un lieu culturel où partager ma passion avec les autres. Mais comment envisager sa durabilité financière sans me perdre, en restant fidèle à mes goûts et à mes convictions ?
Depuis mon plus jeune âge je raffole des papeteries. Toujours à l´affût de nouvelles textures, tailles, et grammages de papier, de carnets, crayons et pinceaux… quand je voyage dans une nouvelle ville, un nouveau pays, les papeteries et les ateliers de papiers artisanaux sont les premiers lieux que j´explore car je sais qu´on y découvre de véritables trésors.  
Je cherche aussi les bouquinistes car si le livre en soi est porteur d´émotion autant que de connaissance, cette qualité prend une dimension encore plus profonde dans le cas du livre d´occasion. Celui-ci évoque l´idée d´une transmission du savoir, non pas massive mais qui circulerait d´un individu a l´autre ; l´idée d´une rencontre, un partage mais dans une autre dimension…
La suite de mes pérégrinations me mène généralement dans les brocantes et les musées ou galeries… Et si je reste un peu plus longtemps, je vais chercher un café dont l’ambiance va me donner envie de revenir m´installer pour travailler.
Aussi j’ai décidé de rassembler toutes ces choses qui me nourrissent, m´apaisent et m´émerveillent dans un projet à la fois modeste et ambitieux mais qui surtout me ressemble.
 
Que va-t-il s y passer ?
Les visiteurs pourront découvrir et acquérir des œuvres créées par des artistes contemporains venant des quatre coins du monde. Ces artistes, émergeants ou déjà établis, auront ceci en commun qu´ils ont fait du papier un de leurs matériaux de prédilection.
J´y programmerai des événements culturels (conférences sur des thèmes liés à l´art et aux sciences humaines, présentations d´artistes, mini-concerts, projections de vidéo d´art, court-métrages, documentaires) ainsi que des workshops, des cours d´art plastique et des séances de modèle vivant qui, avec l´activité salon de thé, librairie-papeterie assureront les revenus du lieu.
La partie salon de thé / café proposera, en plus des cafés et jus classiques, une sélection de thés d´Asie - chacun ayant sa petite histoire à découvrir, des « ca-phe sua da » (le café glace au lait concentré sucré très populaire au Vietnam), et des petites choses à grignoter à partager dans une ambiance exotique.
La partie librairie multilingue (principalement portugais, français et anglais) sera composée de livres d´occasion, dont une sélection d´ouvrages incontournables pour les artistes et les chercheurs en art et sciences humaines.
Le coin papeterie proposera principalement des papiers artisanaux venant d’Asie (Inde, Népal, Vietnam, Bhutan, Japon, Thaïlande) du Mexique et du Portugal, mais aussi des carnets, crayons et pinceaux ainsi que des objets cadeaux liés au papier.
Ça sera également mon atelier / lieu de travail quotidien ou les visiteurs pourront s´ils le désirent voir et discuter avec moi mon travail in progress et ma collection de curiosités (objets rituels collectionnés ou créés par moi-même) ; une façon pour eux d´accéder à l´art de manière simple et conviviale.
 
D´où vient l´appellation « O gabinete de Madame Thao » ?
Artiste de profession, c´est en gardant à l´esprit des titres que je donne à mes expositions que j´ai choisi ce nom qui reflète ma passion pour les cabinets de curiosités, mon goût pour le mystérieux et l´exotisme. Il évoque aussi mes origines (Thao est le diminutif de Thu-Thao, mon prénom vietnamien), les lieux où j’ai vécu (France et Vietnam) et où je vis aujourd´hui (« o gabinete » signifie le cabinet en portugais).
C´est la fusion de toutes ces influences qui va venir créer l´atmosphère du lieu.
 
Oui mais, est-ce que ce projet va changer le monde ?
A une micro-échelle peut-être car ce qui m´importe, au-delà de rendre l´art et son processus accessible, c´est de donner à voir le papier autrement ; faire qu´il soit considéré comme un objet précieux, fabriqué avec soin par des personnes au savoir unique et non comme un simple consommable que l´on peut gaspiller à loisir. Je crois en une approche raisonnée de la dématérialisation et aux bénéfices que celle-ci implique pour la planète.  Envisager le papier sous cet angle inhabituel, c´est participer à sa manière à cette grande marche vers le progrès environnemental… Et à défaut de changer radicalement le monde, j´espère qu´o Gabinete de Madame Thao contribuera aussi, grâce aux moments d´évasion et de partage qu´il permettra, à le rendre plus supportable.
 
Prêts à m´accompagner dans ma nouvelle aventure ?
Afin d´étaler le financement du projet j’ai décomposé les objectifs de cette campagne en 3 paliers.

TEAM EARTHQUAKE's mission is to protect children in major earthquake disasters of the San Andreas or other damaging faults. It begins by giving parents the ""BIG PUSH"" to honestly look at their own lack of training and first aid skills and the absence of available first responders in their neighborhoods and schools when a major earthquake hits. 
Calculations estimate that serious injuries will be upward of 52,000 people, doubling with fire complications. NOBODY IS COMING to HELP YOU unless you organize it now. WE ARE NOT PREPARED.  Where will you go for help when ""BIG ONE"" hits? It seems like every community has no clue. There isn't even a meeting place for those that need help or can help. WHY NOT? Local and City Governments are slow and too cautious with liability, jurisdiction, and just plain afraid of stepping on toes. In the end, we all lose out with weak disaster plans that lack sufficient human man power for medical first aid and search and rescue in our schools, neighborhoods and homes. Nobody is taking charge. It's up to us.
We will lose many lives if we don't organize now.  It may be our own life or a family member's. We have a duty to at least try our best to get it right  before the earthquake, at least for our children's sake. Dead is dead. We may not get a second chance if we get it wrong. 
Our Strategy :Together is Better


This campaign aims to bring action by focusing on parent volunteer groups that already have the experience of working together such like schools, PTA, Girl Scouts, Boy Scouts, AYSO, Little League, YMCA, any other organizations with community/parent volunteers. We will work to coordinate, togetherness now , a melting pot of volunteers of different organizations for the common cause of community disaster first response and relief. 
These groups can supply valuable information to fire departments, search and rescue volunteers, and emergency services about what needs to be done, what has been lost, and who is missing or injured. They know each other and have established a social network which will be important in figuring things out quickly , in saving lives when the chaos surrounds us in the earthquake aftermath.
This is not another talk plan, or useless call tree (at a time no phones will be working). This is an ACTION PLAN and it goes into action the moment the ground starts shaking. Until that day, we will actively push parents to 'Get off Their Butts' and get CERT training (FEMA's Community Emergency Response Teams) and earthquake FIRST AID even for the kids. 



TEAM EARTHQUAKE is the Big Push for disaster preparedness in schools and in communities.  We will strive to get a 'Neighborhood Earthquake Response Station'  in front of Every Public School with trained CERT volunteers leading the community. We will be relentless in targeting established organizations to 'GET OFF THEIR BUTTS'  to prepare for this horrible disaster. We will make it our job to pull everyone together , to plan together, to work together, to train together. Together is better.  It's our only hope to get through it all. It's  COMMUNITY RESILIENCE and we have to begin now.

The Lack of Planning
Many school districts currently hold the ""we've got it covered"" attitude. They ""don't want screaming parents running to the schools"" after a major earthquake. Hmmm?.  School boards discourage parents from organizing disaster response at schools ,fearful of liability yet most teachers and staff are sadly not trained in earthquake injuries or basic search and rescue.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The social center ДЦ КРОВ (“Social Center ROOF”) is a new community space located in Belgrade. It is a creative hub powered by an original membership system, which we are now extending through this campaign. We are a non-corporate union of NGOs; the three founding communities of ROOF are Visual Anthropology Center – VAC; Center for Ethno-musicological Activities – CED and Collective VIZANTROP cooperating with various organizations and individuals.</p>
<p>Furthermore we offer our members diverse programs connected to visual anthropology and ethno-musicology:  local and international workshops of documentary film-making and photography, workshops on ethno music, film screenings, artist residencies for socially engaged filmmakers and social scientists, not to mention various lectures, concerts and other social events.</p>
<p>This campaign is fundamental for us to overcome limitations of borders and other boundaries that would keep us from having a truly global community. We invite you not simply to support a cause but to become a member and actually join this community. All the perks related to the campaign serve this purpose. Our mid-term goal is to continue with this campaign in further phases (<i>in demand</i>) and update it accordingly, so please follow the developments as there will be more to come.</p>
<p>We just opened our doors for the public this Spring, but after the great start raising a lot of interest, we had to temporarily close them again because of the CoVid19 pandemic. This means all but stopping our new activities, as a matter of fact it means we have to come up with more.</p>
<p>This campaign was supposed to focus only on the physical development of ROOF, but due to the global crisis we need to work also on new methods and immediately establish a workflow also in the digital space.</p>
<p>Hence, as you will see in our video presentation, the campaign sets milestone goals. The first goal is basic survival and establishment of the ROOF<i>,</i> the further goals its development to reach its full potential.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need new members to join our local and global creative community. A successful campaign wouldn’t simply mean a good start for us, it would serve as the <strong>foundation </strong>of both our digital community and of DC KROV as a community space – <strong>a </strong><strong>real social network</strong>. A hub of people sharing interests and passions in the field of social sciences, video and photography and ethno music.</p>
<p>Your contributions will improve the<i> <strong>Roof</strong></i> with a silent room/recording studio and a video studio for audio and video production and post production, both equipped to suit all professional requirements.  International and local independent filmmakers and documentary enthusiasts and scholars will get a space to work and network, discuss and realize new ideas together in an inspiring environment.</p>
<p>As a first step in these hard times we will update our programs with <strong>digital courses</strong> and and <strong>workshops. </strong>Then, as soon as possible we will open the editing facilities for distance work or for individual sessions<strong> on-line</strong> workshops.</p>
<p>All the perks related to the campaign get you a membership in our community wherever you are in the world. To enjoy all benefits of the membership you will have to visit us once life gets back to normal, but there is a lot we can achieve together before that happens. We offer digital courses, lectures, workshops and we are determined to share our resources with all of our members in these times of crisis. For more details check out the perks!</p>
<p>We will do our best to provide all the programs and activities we offer even in case this campaign should not be successful. We are counting on your support and we're confident that our minimal goal will be met, however many of our future project are based on support exceeding the minimal goal.</p>
<p>Supposing the smallest perks would be more popular, reaching <strong>1600 </strong> euros would not just mean we are <strong>safe </strong>for the <strong>next three months </strong>and we can <b>finish the audio studio</b>, but that we can count on 2-300 <strong>new members</strong> who would be interested in the <strong>programs </strong>and <strong>services </strong>we can offer.</p>
<p>In the range of <strong>3000 </strong>euros we could also complete <strong>upgrading </strong>the <strong>video studio </strong>with the <b>best available performance technology</b>. That would also mean that we'd have a large local and international member base.</p>
<p>Around <strong>5000 </strong>euros we could <strong>complete </strong>all of the above<b>, </b>plus we could upgrade the <strong>residence room</strong> to be more comfortable and have a powerful<strong> </strong><strong>editing machine </strong>itself.</p>
<p>In the range of <strong>10000 euros </strong>the Roof would be fully equipped and renovated and our running costs would be <strong>guaranteed </strong>for <strong>2020 </strong>regardless of the major catastrophe that is <strong>disrupting social life </strong>in the first months of the year.</p>
<p>In short, <strong>we need you</strong> and your contribution to the community and if you are the kind of person this campaign is meant for what you get is exactly<i><strong> the<strong> </strong>kind of place that you need for working and networking.</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>ROOF will </strong>be able to <strong>function as a professional hub offering the highest technical quality</strong> for <strong>independent audio-video productions.</strong>  We will never compromise any of our community principles to match the corporate competition but we will always  meet the highest professional and creative standards. ROOF as a social center located in the center of Belgrade will serve as a meeting point for creators and their audience while the development of digital strategies will strengthen our international network to reach beyond borders. In times when measures of social distancing are crucial for public health, ROOF as a social center and a community has to find ways to prevent these measures from alienating people. Solidarity and a sense of community can’t be limited by restrictions of movement. We can keep working on these together no matter how many miles or walls between us.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main challenge we are facing right from the start is to keep our newly opened social center alive and grow the community despite of the radical measures of social distancing taken by the state(s) recently. Our society had severe issues that were only aggravated by the pandemic of CoVid19. We founded the Roof to tackle these issues, we believe that the harder the times we are living the most crucial it is for socially engaged, creative people to find new ways to reach out to the world.  </p>
<p>Our ethnographic film workshops, as well as individual and group residency programs have to be delayed until the end of the pandemic due to limitations of the freedom of movement. We will use these times to develop digital strategies, but connecting to our audiences without the chance of meeting in person is a great challenge.</p>
<p>While we firmly believe in transparency and keeping people informed, in our view corporate media is often contributing to the panic. People feel that viral infection is the biggest threat, social distancing is advised as an epidemologic measure. While we do what we can as responsible citizens, we must also look for ways to strengthen and spread social solidarity in our communities with the audio-visual content we create. Visual anthropology and ethnographic methods in creating visual content is essential in the interpretation of adaptive social life in times of crisis.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't support our campaign you can always  share it. Follow VAC', CED and Vizantrop on social media and don't miss out on our activities. Every post click matters in sharing awareness about us and we will be grateful if you share your views with us. We are open for your suggestions as well so don't hesitate to contact us if our community raised your interest.</p>

<h3>Videodrunk has been one of Toronto's most eclectic and adventurous film festivals since 2014.</h3>
</div><div>
<p>For our 2019 edition, happening November 28-30 at the Grand Gerrard, we want to make our festival the biggest and best it has ever been. In order to do this we need your help.</p>
<p>Our goal of this campaign is the raise enough funds to cover the cost of our venue rental ($1500) or as much of it as possible. We're looking for this amount because it will allow us a lot more funds to use for promotion and to put towards the fun stuff (aka beer, with and without alcohol and comedians). And of course helping filmmakers attend.</p>

Videodrunk has been one of Toronto's most eclectic and adventurous film festivals since 2014.

For our 2019 edition, happening November 28-30 at the Grand Gerrard, we want to make our festival the biggest and best it has ever been. In order to do this we need your help.
Our goal of this campaign is the raise enough funds to cover the cost of our venue rental ($1500) or as much of it as possible. We're looking for this amount because it will allow us a lot more funds to use for promotion and to put towards the fun stuff (aka beer, with and without alcohol and comedians). And of course helping filmmakers attend.
The festival will happen with or without these funds.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>14 years ago, Celebrate Mexico Now established itself as the first (and only!) festival committed to promote contemporary Mexican art and culture in New York City. We have been a platform for over 300 talented visual artists, musicians, dancers, authors, chefs and filmmakers to showcase their work in over 50 cultural organizations around the city.</p>
<p>Our festival has presented world premieres of performances, talks and exhibitions by Natalia LaFourcade, Ely Guerra, Alondra de la Parra, Ricardo Legorreta, Enrique Norten, Rafael Lozano-Hemmer, Erick Montes and Elena Poniatowska, among others.</p>
<p>This year, we are thrilled to announce that Celebrate Mexico Now is going beyond New York City. We are partnering with The Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. and the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Walt Disney Concert Hall for additional performances from festival artists!</p>
<p>Join us October 14-22, 2017 in New York City for outstanding events including film screenings, concerts, culinary programs, panels, and performances.</p>

<p>For over a decade, Celebrate Mexico Now has highlighted the creativity, ingenuity, heritage, and heart that contemporary Mexican artists bring to every arts discipline and creative industry. Venturing into to the cutting edge of contemporary expression, Celebrate Mexico Now will bring New Yorkers an exclusive glimpse into how today’s Mexican artists reflect on and reshape Mexican identity in an evolving global context.</p>
<p>Funding for the arts has been cut dramatically in recent years, but we haven’t let that stop us. We have successfully completed 5 Indiegogo campaigns that have let us bring the most dynamic cultural offerings to you.</p>
<p>The performances some of our artists will offer in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., will further expand the Festival’s multi-disciplinary nature.

<p>About Me</p>
<p>My name is Gloria Church and I am an ambassador in Girl Scout Troop 1512 Natchitoches, Louisiana.  Currently, I’m working on my Gold Award project to acquire a state historical marker at Briarwood Nature Preserve for Caroline Dormon.</p>
<p>Summary of Caroline Dormon</p>
<p>Caroline Dormon was born at Briarwood in Saline, Louisiana in 1888. During her time, Dormon accomplished a great number of things for Louisiana.  In 1921, Dormon became the first woman to work for the United States Forestry Department, and she later took major part in establishing Kisatchie National Forest, the only national forest in Louisiana.  Dormon is mostly known for her work in studying and domesticating the purple/ blue Louisiana wild irises.  The great pioneer also was the author and illustrator for a hand full of books about wildlife, including “Flowers Native to the Deep South” and “Bird Talk.”  In 1936, Dormon was recruited by Franklin D. Roosevelt to represent Louisiana on the De Soto Commission, board of five people who mapped out the route of the explorer De Soto.  Dormon is also considered the first nature conservationist in Louisiana because of her work with conserving native wildlife through landscaping.  Dormon worked for Huey P. Long on the Highway Commission Beautification Project, where she preserved native plants along the highways.  In 1965, Caroline Dormon was awarded an honorary doctorate in botany and horticulture from Louisiana State University.  Dormon’s legacy became Briarwood Nature Preserve after she passed in 1971. </p>
<p>Why You Should Donate</p>
<p>I chose to do my Gold Award project on Caroline Dormon because she is underrepresented in the local community considering her great amount of accomplishments.   By establishing a state historical marker, not only does it share the history of Dormon, the sign will attract people into Briarwood Nature Preserve to see her legacy.  I believe that women who had smaller, but important, accomplishments in local regions are not given the credit they deserve.  The sign is a small step, but a push into encouraging other girls to represent historical women in their local regions.     </p>
<p>Where the Funds go.</p>
<p>Most of the funds will be going toward the bronze marker and some of the funds are going toward installing the sign.  Once the money needed on the marker is used, all extra proceedings will be donated to Briarwood Nature Preserve. </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Other ways you can help fund the marker is by sharing this Indigogo page with friends and family who you believe will care about the cause.  Also, you can help underrepresented women by reading about historical women in your area.</p>

<h2>THE POINT</h2>
<p>We need your support, because it is very expensive to organize an event that meets the high standards, providing the best quality and content.</p>
<h2>
<br/>WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h2>
<p>In 2018, we organizing our 4th demo party. <br/>First of all: you will be with an excellent company, hardcore sceners with same interests, <br/>a great party, with presentations (or we will be your audience for your presentation) and contests.<br/>In this year, we would like to reward the best releases with a recent graphics card (or other gifts, depends on our budget collected).<br/>There will be some outside activities, like football and drinking competition - if we able to pay the drinks ;-)<br/> </p>
<h2>WHAT ARE OUR GOALS</h2>
<p>To ensure the financial background of this event. We need to keep the core of Hungarian demo scene together with a well-organized event.<br/>Perhaps bring new people to the scene, sharing the fun of demo coding, graphics and music making both with retro and modern computers, <br/>they are even welcome to join our wild competitions. </p>
<h2>
<br/>WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE REACH OUR GOALS</h2>
<p><br/><strong>0 - 512$ collected</strong></p>
<p>Sad thing, that we didn't hit our goal, maybe next time (or never ??? :-( )<br/><br/><br/><strong>512$ - 1024$ collected</strong></p>
<p>With the entry fees included, we are able to pay the place and technical equipment renting costs.<br/><br/><strong>target amount collected</strong></p>
<p>We are happy to able to pay everything and all category winners will get some nice reward.<br/><br/><strong>More than 2304​$ collected</strong></p>
<p>The very best rewards for the first three winners. The important part, is to have outstanding prods.<br/><br/><i><strong>Above 32,768$ collected </strong></i></p>
<p><i>Feryx will disappear and change his face and name... </i><i>(of course this won’t happen ;-))</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>[the same in Hungarian]</i></p>
<h2>Nos hát tessék a tolmács..</h2>
<p>Egyszer volt, hol nem volt, a pávát tartó lány szobrán túl, ahol a kurta farkú scener túr, Sülysápon. Létezik egy qbparty nevezetű esemény. (Északi szélesség 47 fok, 27 perc, 8 másodperc, keleti hosszúság 19 fok, 32 perc,2 másodperc.)<br/>Nem lesznek itt gonosz palacsinták, harapós fánkok, hanem A paprikás krumpli lesz a díszvendég.</p>
<h3>Nah de a lényeg: </h3>

WHAT ARE OUR GOALS
To ensure the financial background of this event. We need to keep the core of Hungarian demo scene together with a well-organized event.Perhaps bring new people to the scene, sharing the fun of demo coding, graphics and music making both with retro and modern computers, they are even welcome to join our wild competitions. 

WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF WE REACH OUR GOALS

[the same in Hungarian]
Nos hát tessék a tolmács..
Egyszer volt, hol nem volt, a pávát tartó lány szobrán túl, ahol a kurta farkú scener túr, Sülysápon. Létezik egy qbparty nevezetű esemény. (Északi szélesség 47 fok, 27 perc, 8 másodperc, keleti hosszúság 19 fok, 32 perc,2 másodperc.)Nem lesznek itt gonosz palacsinták, harapós fánkok, hanem A paprikás krumpli lesz a díszvendég.
Nah de a lényeg: 
A közösségi gyűjtésre azért van szükség, mert nagyon költséges megrendezni egy ilyen rendezvényt és szeretnénk azt, hogy a maximális minőséget tudjuk megrendezni a scene közösségnek a lehető legtöbb tartalommal. 
Hogy miről van szó?

És mi is történik ha X és Y összeget elérünk?0-512$ Elgondolkodtató lesz e folytatás?..Nem hinném512-1024$ a belépőkkel együtt már kitudjuk fizetni a helyszín és a technika bérleti költségeit.2304$ A Célösszeg Minden kategória első helyezett kap valami fasza díjat.Még több jön össze Nagyon fasza díjak az első 3 helyezettnek.Természetesen 32,768$ felett Feryx eltűnik és arcot és nevet változtat..

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Aloha. I am Mahealani Uchiyama, and Iʻm the founder and artistic director of the Center for International Dance. I am a dancer, musician, teacher and author. </p>
<p>I have been involved in dance and music since I was two years of age, and six decades later, am still dancing! I have, during different times in my life, learned and performed the dances of China, Java, Bali, the Caribbean, North Africa and North India. Through it all, my first love and motivating force has been the dances of Hawaiʻi and Tahiti. As a Kumu Hula, I have taught and led performance tours to Hawaiʻi, Tahiti, New Zealand and Mexico. </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Ww5WvxvwRc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>This campaign is about celebrating our 25th Anniversary. It is also about re-establishing and recommitting to the core mission of this dance center – as a place where dance can be experienced as a form of healing for our multi-ethnic community.</p>
<p>This is important to me, because when I was a child dance made it possible for me to understand that I too had value, and a place in the world. We want to do that for others.</p>
<p>To celebrate our 25 years, we are producing a gala concert that will feature amazing performers of culturally-based dance, many of whom have played a role in the history of our dance center. Your contribution will help us to offset the expenses of renting the theater, hiring production staff and most importantly offering financial support to our guest artists. </p>
<p> </p>

The work of our dance center is to create a refuge for our diverse community; a welcoming place where we can connect with one another. Our 25th Anniversary Concert will showcase what can happen when we convene in an atmosphere of acceptance, support and goodwill. </p>

I have been involved in dance and music since I was two years of age, and six decades later, am still dancing! I have, during different times in my life, learned and performed the dances of China, Java, Bali, the Caribbean, North Africa and North India. Through it all, my first love and motivating force has been the dances of Hawaiʻi and Tahiti. As a Kumu Hula, I have taught and led performance tours to Hawaiʻi, Tahiti, New Zealand and Mexico. 

This campaign is about celebrating our 25th Anniversary. It is also about re-establishing and recommitting to the core mission of this dance center – as a place where dance can be experienced as a form of healing for our multi-ethnic community.
This is important to me, because when I was a child dance made it possible for me to understand that I too had value, and a place in the world. We want to do that for others.
To celebrate our 25 years, we are producing a gala concert that will feature amazing performers of culturally-based dance, many of whom have played a role in the history of our dance center. Your contribution will help us to offset the expenses of renting the theater, hiring production staff and most importantly offering financial support to our guest artists. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
We hope to raise $25,000 for our campaign - $1,000 for each of our 25 years. Here is how your contribution will help us:
Artist Fees: $13,000Theater (tech rehearsal and performance) $5,000Crew (sound engineer, lighting designer, etc.) $5,000Publicity: $3,000 
We have prepared some fun and unique awards for you! They include:
 
A Souvenir Program from the concert signed by the performing artists
25th Anniversary Commemorative Tee Shirts
Premier seats to the Gala Concert
Your name in our program
Admission for two to the VIP Reception
A fresh flower lei greeting upon arrival at the theater
A 30 minute performance by Hālau Ka Ua Tuahine at the location of your choice
And a two-hour boat cruise on the Bay for ten people (includes performance, appetizers and drinks).
Make an ongoing monthly donation of any amount from $25 and up and receive discounts for our self produced performances as well as admission to MUCIDʻs Annual Supporters Reception, as well as recognition in our programs and other communications.
Choose your own amount for a one-time donation and receive recognition in our programs and other communications.
Please know that whether or not our goal is reached, the concert will take place, and your contributions will help us!

The Impact
We hold that through exploring that which you are drawn to in depth, one can learn about one's self, connecting more deeply with who you truly are as well as with others from different cultures. The work of our dance center is to create a refuge for our diverse community; a welcoming place where we can connect with one another. Our 25th Anniversary Concert will showcase what can happen when we convene in an atmosphere of acceptance, support and goodwill. 
In our 25 years we have produced or co-produced these major events:
Diamonds, Shells and AmberA collective performance featuring Suhaila Salimpour, FatChanceBellyDance, and Hālau Ka Ua Tuahine. Cowell Theater, San Francisco.
Hoʻolaha - Hula Spans The GlobeA concert featuring Hālau o Keikialiʻi, Hālau Nā Mamo Nōʻeau and Hālau Ka Ua Tuahine which celebrated the Hawaiian - Californian connection. Reed L. Buffington Performing Arts Center, Hayward.
A Walk By The SeaA celebration of the unity of the human spirit including performances of Zimbabwean, Hawaiian, Tahitian and Cherokee music and dance. Julia Morgan Theater in Berkeley and Valley Center for the Performing Arts, Oakland.
Annual Repertory ConcertsAn annual series of performances featuring the students and faculty of the Center For International Dance.  Julia Morgan Theater in Berkeley and Valley Center for the Performing Arts, Oakland.
20th Anniversary ConcertA gala concert celebrating 20 years of dance. Valley Center for the Performing Arts, Oakland.

<h3>~EXTENDED CUT~</h3>
<p>So it looks like we hit our initial goal- YAYYYYYYYYY! ...unfortunately the shutdown for venues like ourselves has been stretched beyond the initial cut off of mid-March and so in turn we are extending our goal as well. </p>
<p>With that stretch we wanted to make sure we were offering up something different... and since we had quite a few people reach out to us and ask for some lower tiers of support, we have added this limited (2 wk) run of specialty options and thank you gifts- including music, booze, and PW merch (now if you already contributed at one of the higher membership levels we of course wont turn away any additional donation, but please know that we are already going to send along an extra thank you gift).</p>

The Buildup
Hey all, we as a venue have worked very hard over the last 10 years to provide a creative space and bring together the best in music, arts, and community events. As you likely know, the current global pandemic has forced Public Works to temporarily close our doors and reschedule (or in some cases even cancel) all events from mid-March through (at least) the beginning of May. This shutdown has presented many challenges for PW as a business, as an employer, and as a community.
We have been working diligently and desperately to take care of our employees while doing everything possible to make it through this current crisis in one piece. Everyone here is dedicated and committed to continue making PW a space where folks can make a living while “giving the people what they want.” But we can’t do it alone.

This total shutdown means that all  income for the venue has stopped, but our ongoing expenses like rent, payroll, insurance, utilities, etc. have not. Unless we are able to bring in some revenue, there is a very real risk that Public Works won’t be able to stay open post quarantine.
With that in mind we’ve put together some amazing once-in-a-lifetime packages in return for your support; purchasing one of them now means we can all keep the party going later and make sure this amazing community we have built continues for years to come.

<h3>In 2021, the Sing For Freedom Choir has ambitious plans to welcome new members, make a music video for Zero Discrimination Day, and hire a community support worker to provide vital pastoral support.</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The Sing For Freedom Choir is a remarkable group of people who sing from a shared love of music to reclaim the voice that torture so cruelly tried to silence. This amazing and vulnerable community is made up of Survivors affiliated with UK charity Freedom from Torture after facing extreme difficulties in their countries of origin, and Londoners who join to sing in solidarity with them . In 2019 they were perilously close to shutting down and were saved by the crowdfunding community.</p>
<p>The Sing For Freedom Choir has fought to stay together during lockdown, providing a lifeline at a time where many of the members have found the usual services they access cut. Some of them have been working on the front line as NHS workers, and many of them do not have access to data and technology at home. Despite this, they have managed to make the ""I Choose Love"" music video as a demonstration of solidarity with survivors everywhere, inspiring resilience at the time of hardship and anxiety.</p>

Your support will enable us to: 

Welcome new choir members who have also experienced displacement in January 2021
Zero Discrimination Day film project with the Soundabout Choirs, an inclusive choir whose members have severe learning disabilities
Hire a community support worker to offer vital pastoral support & signposting to services & opportunities
Offer training with digital technology and software
Continue to fund data payments for members throughout the continued pandemic


 
The impact of your support for this project means:
The project will enable more people who have experienced displacement to access the therapeutic benefits of singing in a choir. Sing For Freedom Choir has changed lives, and as one member says, ""One of the worst things about torture is that it silences you….the choir has given me back a voice"". 
The film created for Zero Discrimination Day will empower people who regularly experience discrimination, including those with disabilities, refugees and asylum seekers, to provide a vision of what a more inclusive world could be through performance of ""I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing"", with a message of ending discrimination. 
With services cut as a result of the pandemic, hiring a community support worker will offer, once a week, vital pastoral support and signposting to mutual aid, education and employment opportunities. 
By offering training in digital technology and data support, we will enable our members to not only access the choir, but also connect to vital support services.

Shapeshifters is locally-owned and operated by Gilbert Guerrero and Kathleen Quillian. </p><p>Shapeshifters started in 2012 as a monthly, volunteer-run series focused on expanded cinema. For the past several years we have been working towards building on the success of the series by securing our own space and developing a business plan to make Shapeshifters a more permanent, self-sustaining organization. Since we signed the lease on our new space in 2018 we have been working on securing permits and finalizing plans to add a brewery and taproom. We are now nearly ready to begin construction but first we need to raise $30,000 to cover incidental costs before the contractors will begin work. </p><h3><strong>Our Story </strong></h3><p>Shapeshifters Cinema began in 2012 as a monthly series focused on expanded cinema, featuring moving image work by experimental filmmakers and video artists with accompaniment from sound artists, musicians, and artists from other creative disciplines. So far in our 7 ½ year run, we have presented 86 shows featuring over 200 artists performing experimental and expanded moving image and sonic art to over 3,500 people. At every show we offer a limited, small batch of beer on tap that Gilbert has been developing through his personal homebrewing practice. To date he has served over 350 gallons of his award-winning brewing experiments at Shapeshifters programs. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578511454/bgwf2qnq4ioc31cw33uo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Shapeshifters emerged from a deep-seated and long-standing dedication to the Bay Area experimental film community. After decades of working behind the scenes with artists and non-profit arts organizations in San Francisco (most notably Artists’ Television Access, San Francisco Cinematheque and Leonardo/ISAST), we decided to bring our experience and energy to Oakland, the place we call home and where we are raising our family. The series originally took place at Arbor Cafe in North Oakland and was later moved to the Temescal Art Center, a community-based non-profit performance space, where it ran monthly for the next 7 years. The series has been supported by the Zellerbach Family Foundation (5 time grant awardee), Southern Exposure’s Alternative Exposure Grant (2 time grant awardee), the Clorox Foundation (2 time grant awardee), and individual donors, with fiscal sponsorship from the San Francisco Cinematheque. The funding provided by these foundations and other individual donors has allowed us to offer free admission and to provide artists a small stipend for their participation in the series, with the occasional stipend for some of our administrative work. After 7 ½ years of this it has become clear that we are providing something more than just a vanity project for experimental moving image and sound art and it is time to step up our game to create a more sustainable venue with a more stable future, which is capable of providing for artists, audiences and administrators alike.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578511989/j4yph0wf2bmqxyi8okyg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>In September 2019 we took a major leap and moved into our own building with the vision of providing a community space for a variety of programs, including our long-standing, popular expanded cinema series, as well as a wide range of experimental moving image art, music, sound art, and radical performance by local and traveling artists and curators. To sustain the venue, we have chosen to replace grants and donations provided by foundations and individuals with a vital earned income stream provided by the microbrewery and taproom, which will be open during shows as well as nights when the cinema is dark, as well as a small in-house store that will feature artist-made and small press DVDs, CDs, LPs, books, zines and more.</p><h3><strong>Our Beer</strong></h3><p>Gilbert has been brewing beer for over 7 years. It started out of curiosity and a series of experiments on a 5-gallon homebrewing kit. In the process, he discovered a contemporary world of consumable alchemy, involving ingredients, process, time and chemistry.  He joined the Bay Area Mashers Homebrew Club where he learned invaluable information from his fellow homebrewing comrades during monthly meetings. In 2013 he started Temescal Homebrewing to provide hand-packed homebrew kits and monthly workshops for others interested in the art of homebrewing. He has given talks and taught public and private homebrew workshops for Preserved, the Biofuel Oasis and the Marin Public Library for over 4 years. In 2018, he won first prize in the World Cup of Beer competition for his Synesthesia Pale Ale recipe.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578416032/lq3nqd9e8pijvjmzbams.png"" src=""""/></p><p>We believe beer should be fresh, local and creative. Our menu of beers have been developed using non-traditional processes and recipes with one eye keenly focused on history, political awareness, community building and creative practices. Here are a few: </p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Synesthesia Pale Ale. </strong>A blend of hop varieties play with the senses in this malty pale ale with notes of white wine grapes, peaches, and citrus. </li>
<li>
<strong>Ice Cold Popcorn IPA. </strong>Freshly popped popcorn is added to the grain bill along with a dash of sea salt, making this chewy, hazy IPA light and flavorful. </li>
<li>
<strong>Americas Schwarzbier. </strong>A rich, black lager made with toasted indigenous corn as part of the grain bill. </li>
<li>
<strong>Drunken Sea Imperial Rice Pilsner. </strong>Large quantities of rice round out this dry, incredibly light, slightly bitter Pilsner that has a kick to keep you rocking on the high seas. </li>
<li>
<strong>Magentachrome Cherry Grisette. </strong>This hearty, five-grain blend of rolled barley, oats, rye, wheat, and triticale is fermented on Saison yeast, then racked on fresh cherries, giving it a nostalgic pink hue.</li>
<li>
<strong>Blackberry Gose.</strong> A tart rye wheat beer fermented on local blackberries harvested at their peak. </li>
</ul><p> </p><h3><strong>The Financial Break-down</strong></h3><p>Starting up a new business is costly! Our organization has a solid history of presenting amazing art by incredible, independent artists from around the world. In order to grow into the next phase of our existence, we need a little help to get things started.</p><p>We have already contributed over <strong>$100K</strong> of our own for: </p><ul>
<li>architects fees,</li>
<li>structural engineering fees,</li>
<li>Conditional Use Permit (required to sell alcohol),</li>
<li>building permits and health department fees,</li>
<li>purchasing comfortable, vintage theater chairs,</li>
<li>purchasing a new sound system with subwoofer,</li>
<li>and paying a security deposit, rent, insurance, and utilities. </li>
</ul><p> </p><p>We are working with a lender to get an SBA-backed business loan for <strong>$250K</strong> to cover:</p><ul>
<li>basic construction, </li>
<li>sewage, plumbing, electrical, </li>
<li>an ADA accessible bathroom, </li>
<li>cold storage room, </li>
<li>kegerators, </li>
<li>starting inventory,</li>
<li>and working capital. </li>
</ul><p> </p><p>The $30,000 we raise during this fundraising campaign is essential seed money necessary to get started on construction of the brewery and taproom—an important element for our future operations which will provide a sustainable source of earned income. Both the lender and the general contractor require us to have this money on hand, which will be earmarked to cover “incidental costs” associated with construction, before they allow construction to begin.</p><p>If there are no incidental costs during construction, the money we raise during this campaign will go towards fixing up the deck surrounding the building—a necessary step in order to open the future-planned back patio beer garden. </p><p>All money raised <i>beyond</i> the stated goal will be used to buy much of the necessary equipment we need to establish a functional brewing operation:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>$5,000</strong> will buy an under counter glass washer. </li>
<li>
<strong>$2,000</strong> will buy a 3 compartment sink, utility sink, floor sink, mop sink, and two hand sinks </li>
<li>
<strong>$10,000</strong> will buy a 1 BBL brewing system, complete with control panel, heat exchanger</li>
<li>
<strong>$10,000 </strong>will buy 4 temperature-controlled unitanks for fermentation and carbonation</li>
<li>
<strong>$7,000 </strong>will buy a small glycol chiller, kegs, pumps, hoses and connectors</li>

Shapeshifters is locally-owned and operated by Gilbert Guerrero and Kathleen Quillian. Shapeshifters started in 2012 as a monthly, volunteer-run series focused on expanded cinema. For the past several years we have been working towards building on the success of the series by securing our own space and developing a business plan to make Shapeshifters a more permanent, self-sustaining organization. Since we signed the lease on our new space in 2018 we have been working on securing permits and finalizing plans to add a brewery and taproom. We are now nearly ready to begin construction but first we need to raise $30,000 to cover incidental costs before the contractors will begin work. Our Story Shapeshifters Cinema began in 2012 as a monthly series focused on expanded cinema, featuring moving image work by experimental filmmakers and video artists with accompaniment from sound artists, musicians, and artists from other creative disciplines. So far in our 7 ½ year run, we have presented 86 shows featuring over 200 artists performing experimental and expanded moving image and sonic art to over 3,500 people. At every show we offer a limited, small batch of beer on tap that Gilbert has been developing through his personal homebrewing practice. To date he has served over 350 gallons of his award-winning brewing experiments at Shapeshifters programs. Shapeshifters emerged from a deep-seated and long-standing dedication to the Bay Area experimental film community. After decades of working behind the scenes with artists and non-profit arts organizations in San Francisco (most notably Artists’ Television Access, San Francisco Cinematheque and Leonardo/ISAST), we decided to bring our experience and energy to Oakland, the place we call home and where we are raising our family. The series originally took place at Arbor Cafe in North Oakland and was later moved to the Temescal Art Center, a community-based non-profit performance space, where it ran monthly for the next 7 years. The series has been supported by the Zellerbach Family Foundation (5 time grant awardee), Southern Exposure’s Alternative Exposure Grant (2 time grant awardee), the Clorox Foundation (2 time grant awardee), and individual donors, with fiscal sponsorship from the San Francisco Cinematheque. The funding provided by these foundations and other individual donors has allowed us to offer free admission and to provide artists a small stipend for their participation in the series, with the occasional stipend for some of our administrative work. After 7 ½ years of this it has become clear that we are providing something more than just a vanity project for experimental moving image and sound art and it is time to step up our game to create a more sustainable venue with a more stable future, which is capable of providing for artists, audiences and administrators alike.In September 2019 we took a major leap and moved into our own building with the vision of providing a community space for a variety of programs, including our long-standing, popular expanded cinema series, as well as a wide range of experimental moving image art, music, sound art, and radical performance by local and traveling artists and curators. To sustain the venue, we have chosen to replace grants and donations provided by foundations and individuals with a vital earned income stream provided by the microbrewery and taproom, which will be open during shows as well as nights when the cinema is dark, as well as a small in-house store that will feature artist-made and small press DVDs, CDs, LPs, books, zines and more.Our BeerGilbert has been brewing beer for over 7 years. It started out of curiosity and a series of experiments on a 5-gallon homebrewing kit. In the process, he discovered a contemporary world of consumable alchemy, involving ingredients, process, time and chemistry.  He joined the Bay Area Mashers Homebrew Club where he learned invaluable information from his fellow homebrewing comrades during monthly meetings. In 2013 he started Temescal Homebrewing to provide hand-packed homebrew kits and monthly workshops for others interested in the art of homebrewing. He has given talks and taught public and private homebrew workshops for Preserved, the Biofuel Oasis and the Marin Public Library for over 4 years. In 2018, he won first prize in the World Cup of Beer competition for his Synesthesia Pale Ale recipe.We believe beer should be fresh, local and creative. Our menu of beers have been developed using non-traditional processes and recipes with one eye keenly focused on history, political awareness, community building and creative practices. Here are a few: 

Synesthesia Pale Ale. A blend of hop varieties play with the senses in this malty pale ale with notes of white wine grapes, peaches, and citrus. 

Ice Cold Popcorn IPA. Freshly popped popcorn is added to the grain bill along with a dash of sea salt, making this chewy, hazy IPA light and flavorful. 

Americas Schwarzbier. A rich, black lager made with toasted indigenous corn as part of the grain bill. 

Drunken Sea Imperial Rice Pilsner. Large quantities of rice round out this dry, incredibly light, slightly bitter Pilsner that has a kick to keep you rocking on the high seas. 

Magentachrome Cherry Grisette. This hearty, five-grain blend of rolled barley, oats, rye, wheat, and triticale is fermented on Saison yeast, then racked on fresh cherries, giving it a nostalgic pink hue.

Blackberry Gose. A tart rye wheat beer fermented on local blackberries harvested at their peak. 
 The Financial Break-downStarting up a new business is costly! Our organization has a solid history of presenting amazing art by incredible, independent artists from around the world. In order to grow into the next phase of our existence, we need a little help to get things started.We have already contributed over $100K of our own for: 
architects fees,
structural engineering fees,
Conditional Use Permit (required to sell alcohol),
building permits and health department fees,
purchasing comfortable, vintage theater chairs,
purchasing a new sound system with subwoofer,
and paying a security deposit, rent, insurance, and utilities. 
 We are working with a lender to get an SBA-backed business loan for $250K to cover:
basic construction, 
sewage, plumbing, electrical, 
an ADA accessible bathroom, 
cold storage room, 
kegerators, 
starting inventory,
and working capital. 
 The $30,000 we raise during this fundraising campaign is essential seed money necessary to get started on construction of the brewery and taproom—an important element for our future operations which will provide a sustainable source of earned income. Both the lender and the general contractor require us to have this money on hand, which will be earmarked to cover “incidental costs” associated with construction, before they allow construction to begin.If there are no incidental costs during construction, the money we raise during this campaign will go towards fixing up the deck surrounding the building—a necessary step in order to open the future-planned back patio beer garden. All money raised beyond the stated goal will be used to buy much of the necessary equipment we need to establish a functional brewing operation:

$5,000 will buy an under counter glass washer. 

$2,000 will buy a 3 compartment sink, utility sink, floor sink, mop sink, and two hand sinks 

$10,000 will buy a 1 BBL brewing system, complete with control panel, heat exchanger

$10,000 will buy 4 temperature-controlled unitanks for fermentation and carbonation

$7,000 will buy a small glycol chiller, kegs, pumps, hoses and connectors

So are we.Democrats have all the right ideas—but they're spending their money in all the wrong places. Meanwhile, Republicans are crushing us online. Tech for Campaigns can fix that.  With your help, Tech for Campaigns (TFC) can build a digital arm for the Left. Our community of 3,000 skilled volunteers will supercharge campaigns with digital expertise—like building email programs, running social media advertising, and analyzing voter data—and software tools we’re building. In short: we give political campaigns a digital makeover. For free. Our goal: complete 500 digital campaign projects by the end of 2018. For free.With your contribution, you’ll help real candidates across the country win their elections—and join a new dialogue about how tech and politics can work together.Get access to our fireside chats with tech and political leaders for real dialogues about how tech and politics should work together—and how they shouldn’t. What would you ask former Twitter CEO Dick Costolo or former Michigan governor Jennifer Granholm if you had the chance?To change politics in America, we need a different solution—and the conversation starts with you. What is the problem?Democrats are spending their money in all the wrong places—and Republicans are outspending & outmaneuvering us online.Today’s voters get most of their information online. According to AdWeek, we spend 5.6 hours online every single day. In 2016, more money was spent on Internet ads than television ads in the US.And yet, Democrats only spend 5-10% of their campaign funds on digital channels! Meanwhile, the Republicans have prioritized digital: they spend more money, for longer periods of time—in smarter ways.On average in the 2016 Senate races, Republicans outspent Democrats on Google digital channels (like YouTube) by 3 to 1. It got even worse from January to June, to the tune of  20 to 1.This hurts us everywhere. But it’s been most devastating at the state level—where races are won and lost by just hundreds or thousands of votes. You probably know Democrats lost Congress in the last 2 elections. But did you know we’ve been crushed at the state level too? Why do state elections matter so much?In most states the legislatures decide how federal and state districts are drawn—AKA, they are really important!State governments also make decisions on major issues like health care, gun control, and environmental protections. You hear a lot about “taking back Congress” or “flipping the house”—but we can’t do that in a meaningful way without changing how the districts are drawn.And that starts with the state legislatures. So, how can we fix it?Tech for Campaigns helps progressives & centrists by matching them with best-in-class talent and technology they need to win state elections.Our mission: activate our network of 3,000 volunteers to build tech tools and strategies that candidates can use for years to come. We’re not just helping one campaign; we’re changing the way campaigns are run. All over the country.Today’s voters get most of their information online. And winning online requires better advertising and targeting, smoother websites, and smarter data. But Democrats haven’t caught up—and keep spending their campaign funds in all the wrong places. We match talented experts from our community of 3,000 volunteers to campaign teams—and take on their biggest digital challenges.Whether it’s running social media advertising programs, analyzing complex voter data, or building tools for automating fundraising research, we’re writing a digital campaign playbook that actually works. How you can help—and what’s in it for you?It all starts by bridging the gap between technology and politics. With a contribution of $100 or more, you’ll get access to an online fireside chat with a notable pair of leaders: one from tech, and the other from politics. Like Jason Kander and Sam Altman—or Jennifer Granholm and Dick Costolo!You have a right to be involved in the conversation about the role of technology in politics. How can they work together—and where should we draw the line? It’s not a backroom conversation. It’s something people like you should be able to lead. With your help, we'll tackle 500 digital projects:We’ve already proven that TFC works. By next month, we’ll have completed 50 successful campaign projects.
Next, we'll build technical infrastructure and software tools 
Shared best practice guides, templates and toolkits to optimize online spending
Data models to help states understand which districts are most competitive—and where to focus their efforts
Employ full-time staff to build these products—and manage 500+ teams of skilled volunteers
Our north star goals:
Achieve better political results in 2018 and beyond
Widen access to politics and empower long-term volunteerism
Teach pro campaigners how to leverage technology to win elections
 CASE STUDIESHere’s how the campaigns we work with feel about TFC.For James Thompson's special Election race in April 2017, we ran their paid social media program. Including their targeting, creative assets, copy and reporting. In under 2 months, our TFC team started their paid programs from scratch, taking them from: 
 1,300 to 10,000 followers 
20 to 600 likes per post
Engagement levels 15x higher than their opponent's
 Meet the TFC TeamOur founders & volunteers hail from all over—but are proven tech experts who want to change how politics works. With so many races in 2018, how do you choose which ones to focus on?National elections get all the attention, but state-level elections are secretly the center of political power.Fun fact: State-level politicians control how much your vote matters—locally, and nationally. Yep. You read that right.We know, we know: you probably don’t pay attention to state elections. They’re like the Minor Leagues. But your local state officials control how much your votes matter—because they control redistricting at the state and national level.That’s right: in most states, your state legislature gets to redraw the boundary lines of Congressional districts. And for years, Republicans have been doing this in a way that is ridiculously favorable to their candidates—while totally disenfranchising Democratic voters.This is called gerrymandering. Should you care about gerrymandering? Yes—if you ever want Congress back.Gerrymandering is secretly the worst problem in American democracy. The Republicans are rigging the game, and we need to take action now.Republicans use gerrymandering to suppress the impact of your vote. And the votes of women, minorities, and other groups that tend to support Democrats.In 2020, your elected state officials will redraw their districts—and we’ll be stuck with those lines for another ten years.So, the people we elect next year matter. A lot. We need to start taking back the states now to even have a chance of taking back Congress in 2020.It's 2017. All campaigns should get best-in-class digital help.Let's bridge the gap between tech & politics - and start winning again.  TFC in the NewsWe've been lucky enough to have our work featured in leading publications like:Read more: Recode| Quartz | NPR | Next Gen Dem Podcast FAQsQ: Are the fireside chats in person or online?A: A bit of both.

<p><u><strong>SMASH SEASON IS UPON US</strong></u></p>
<p> <strong>Smash Friday is the new Black Friday!</strong></p>
<p>Have a lot of <strong>stuff</strong> to buy the day after Thanksgiving? Everyone loves <strong>stuff</strong>! But you know what else they love? <strong>Smashing stuff! </strong>It's gonna get thrown away eventually - <strong>so smash it now</strong>! (Not your stuff, we have other stuff to smash.)</p>
<p>Also, Black Friday is what you name a day where something <strong>serious</strong> happened, not a day of buying <strong>screens and toasters.</strong> Nothing against toast or videos, but oh never mind, <strong>JUST SMASH SOMETHING!</strong></p>
<p>In the <strong>Smash Truck</strong>, we've got <strong>eye</strong> protection, <strong>gloves</strong>, <strong>soundtrack</strong>, steel <strong>pipes</strong> and baseball <strong>bats</strong>, and stuff to <strong>SMASH</strong>! We'll gear folks up and cheer them on as they smash the ever-lovin' crap out of screens, appliances, and other stuff past its planned obsolescence expiration date.</p>
<p>We can even take a <strong>youfie</strong> (it's a selfie that someone else takes of you, like in the old days - see if you can help get the trend going) with a <strong>holiday card cutout</strong> so it can be printed from one's own phone - wow!  <strong>Mid-tech!</strong></p>

</div></div>","SMASH SEASON IS UPON US
 Smash Friday is the new Black Friday!
Have a lot of stuff to buy the day after Thanksgiving? Everyone loves stuff! But you know what else they love? Smashing stuff! It's gonna get thrown away eventually - so smash it now! (Not your stuff, we have other stuff to smash.)
Also, Black Friday is what you name a day where something serious happened, not a day of buying screens and toasters. Nothing against toast or videos, but oh never mind, JUST SMASH SOMETHING!
In the Smash Truck, we've got eye protection, gloves, soundtrack, steel pipes and baseball bats, and stuff to SMASH! We'll gear folks up and cheer them on as they smash the ever-lovin' crap out of screens, appliances, and other stuff past its planned obsolescence expiration date.
We can even take a youfie (it's a selfie that someone else takes of you, like in the old days - see if you can help get the trend going) with a holiday card cutout so it can be printed from one's own phone - wow!  Mid-tech!

Moreover, organization of social events decrease the ordinary turnover since we stop the kitchen and the coffee machines not to disturb the event.</p>
<p>Wouldn't it be nice if we had a modest budget to spend for travel and accomodation expenses of our visitors so that we can determine the annual program of socio-cultural events of our House of Hope?</p>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>We hold two or three events per week and we need approximately $150 to finance the travel and hotel expenses of our visitors. If we can finance an event per week thanks to your solidarity we can host about 50 events from fall to summer. </p>
<p>We would need also $1000 to print the montly bulletin.</p>
<h3>So what?</h3>
<p>We see all these events as seeds of hope since they encourage us to come together and find new sources of hope and ressistance. So the more we have of these seeds, the more we are ressilient and hopeful.</p>

Moreover, organization of social events decrease the ordinary turnover since we stop the kitchen and the coffee machines not to disturb the event.
Wouldn't it be nice if we had a modest budget to spend for travel and accomodation expenses of our visitors so that we can determine the annual program of socio-cultural events of our House of Hope?
How?
We hold two or three events per week and we need approximately $150 to finance the travel and hotel expenses of our visitors. If we can finance an event per week thanks to your solidarity we can host about 50 events from fall to summer. 
We would need also $1000 to print the montly bulletin.
So what?
We see all these events as seeds of hope since they encourage us to come together and find new sources of hope and ressistance. So the more we have of these seeds, the more we are ressilient and hopeful.
In short, we invite you to become one of the gardeners of this land of hope",1.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<h3>The Bill Monroe Museum is the only one of its kind. </h3>
<p>While museums, musicians, halls of fame, and entire genres pay tribute to Bill Monroe, the Bill Monroe Museum will house his complete legacy. Telling the entire story of his life and musical career just feet from where Bill used to play baseball before performing for the crowds! There will even be stories and facts that have, until now, remained family stories tucked away in the hills of Rosine. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""It means the world! It gives people a chance now to come from all over the world to see my father's museum."" -- James Monroe</i></p>
<h3>Construction in Rosine is underway. Urgent need for furnishings!</h3>
<p>The building itself is paid for and construction has begun just across the street from the famous Rosine Barn Jamboree. The groundbreaking ceremony on May 22nd hosted some bluegrass music greats and announced that the Bill Monroe Museum will come to fruition! However, all that is certain is the building itself. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496332666/qfnrkv8jddxqhefqok6t.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The County has paid for the 'shell' but the museum needs much more than a roof! Displays, lighting, cases, furniture, a theater, and much more are still needed before the museum can open. This campaign is what will give the Bill Monroe Museum its character and flair. Many things are planned; an interactive timeline of Bill's life, a theater, multiple dedicated exhibit areas, but nothing is guaranteed. <strong>Your contributions will give the Bill Monroe Museum the future it deserves!</strong></p>
<p>History is being made in Rosine, KY and you can directly influence its timeline and the degree to which we honor the legacy of Bill Monroe and bluegrass history. </p>
<h3>Your tax-deductible donation.</h3>
<p>The Ohio County Tourism Commission is a quasi-government organization and all contributions are tax deductible. You will receive a charitable receipt immediately upon your donation! If you'd like to give directly (recommended for large contributions) visit <a href=""http://www.billmonroemuseum.com/donate/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our website's donate page</a>.</p>

That’s why we are asking the Bluegrass Family to be a part of building a home for the legacy of the Father of Bluegrass.” - Jody Flener, Ohio County Tourism Commission Executive Director</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal and How It's Used</h3>
<p>Our goal is $300K. This amount will allow for a very basic build-out of the museum. The funds will enable the purchase of:</p>
<ul>
<li>A security system to protect the building and items inside</li>
<li>Furniture for the welcome area and conference room</li>
<li>Directional lighting fixtures for lighting of exhibits</li>
<li>Display cases for items</li>
<li>Restoration on many of the items to be displayed (some items will cost many thousands of dollars to restore)</li>
<li>Framing for hanging art and memorabilia </li>
<li>Preservation of sensitive items </li>
<li>An interactive timeline of Bill's life</li>
<li>Various placards and informational signs</li>
<li>Design of info-boards and displays</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some donations used for specific items</h3>
<p>There are special items in our list that require specific funding. The funding of these perks will determine if those specific items end up happening! Like the mandolins made from wood taken from Jerusalem Ridge and the Homeplace itself or the welcome theater... If no one funds those perks, they won't happen!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496333395/aip3fmu9buzteurdzxwy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What happens with additional funds</h3>
<p>While the goal is $300K, this will truly only allow for a basic museum so DON'T STOP THERE! When the goal is reached and we start gaining additional funds, that's when we can start making the museum GREAT! Additional funds will allow for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restoration of more items</li>
<li>Production of videos recording never-before-shared Monroe family stories and documenting the lesser-known life of Bill Monroe</li>
<li>Acquisition of some extremely rare items</li>
<li>Upgraded security </li>
<li>Curated exhibits</li>
<li>Humidity and temperature controlled display cases for instruments like the Jerusalem Ridge Mandolins</li>
<li><strong>If we reach $1M an auditorium seating 750 will be built onto the museum to host live concerts and performances!</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>The perks list is long because there is something for every lover of bluegrass! We also have some special perks in the works so it will be important for you to check back often and watch the <a href=""http://www.billmonroemuseum.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Museum Website</a> for special, limited offers!</p>
<p><strong>Digital Packages</strong></p>
<p>If you want behind-the-scenes access and exclusive content, then the digital packages are for you. The VIP package will have TONS of content and even a video of a trip to one of the largest private Bill Monroe collections in existence. </p>
<p><strong>Blue Moon Walkway Bricks</strong></p>
<p>The walkway leading up to the museum and around the statue of Bill Monroe will be made of bricks featuring the immortalized sentiment of bluegrass fans everywhere! Get a small or large brick with your custom message to be laid in this historic walkway!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""When news of this project first hit, my wife and I quickly purchased our brick for the Blue Moon Walkway. As part of the bluegrass community, we are proud of this project and proud to have a tangible connection to this project."" -- Chris Joslin, Executive Director of the International Bluegrass Museum in Owensboro, KY</i></p>
<p><strong>Founders Packages</strong></p>
<p>Includes an official founder plaque set on cedar taken from the original siding of the Bill Monroe Homeplace, a certificate awarding citizenship of Bill Monroe's hometown of Rosine, and much more! The top levels are able to dedicate the 3 exhibit display areas and one lucky person will name the welcome theater!</p>
<p><strong>Ribbon Cutting Package</strong></p>
<p>While the ribbon cutting ceremony itself will open to the public, there will be a private tour and reveal for the bluegrass elite. Names likely to attend are James Monroe, Ronnie Reno, Dale McCoury, Larry Sparks, and more. Founders receiving the Ribbon Cutting Package will have an all-expenses-paid trip for two to Rosine, KY to make sure they don't miss it! Those founders who dedicated or named parts of the museum will be able to present them personally. After the ceremony, attend a private dinner and jam session with the bluegrass elite. </p>

</div></div>","Breve Resumen 
Soy profesor titular de la U. de los Andes de Venezuela, en derecho y ciencias políticas, desde 1965. Publicó una veintena de libros y muchos artículos en revistas y folletos. Se anexa listado
Como ahora no hay recursos para publicar, utilizar las redes (Facebook y blog) que se puede consultar libremente. Pero en muchos medios académicos se prefiere el texto escrito.
Al participar en esta campaña, los colaboradores para mantener el nivel de la Universidad, divulgar las ideas y los conocimientos y garantizar el derecho a la libertad de expresión. En última instancia, a salvar nuestra cultura, gravemente amenazada ahora mismo.     

Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes
Están listos para publicar 6 libros (sobre temas jurídicos, políticos, históricos y sociales). De ellos, 3  este año y los demás el próximo año.
El costo de la publicación de los 6 libros es de $ 10,000. La venta de los libros no cubre ese monto. La inflación que sufre el país obliga a subsidiar a los compradores (en este caso estudiantes y académicos). La publicación se hará en Venezuela, para contribuir a mantener nuestra industria gráfica, seriamente afectada por la crisis. 
Los libros se publican en la medida en que se recauden los fondos. De manera similar, se se distribuyen los beneficios.
Los colaboradores de más de $25 recibirán los primeros tres libros publicados. Los de más de $ 50 los 6 libros publicados. Quienes colaboren con  mas de $100 (y así lo autorizan) serán mencionados al final del texto de cada uno de los libros    
 El impacto
La campaña me permite cumplir con mis tareas como profesor. Pero, permitir la Universidad cumplir con uno de sus finos: proyectos e ideas en la comunidad. Ya lo antes antes, pero no lo puedes hacer ahora, por falta de recursos.
En tiempo de crisis, solo se puede usar las cosas básicas, como las referidas a la alimentación y la salud. Es comprensible y necesario. Pero también se debe atender a otras necesidades del ser humano (como la educación y la cultura). No solo de pan vive el hombre
Hoy existe un consenso general en señalar que un cierto nivel de desarrollo cultural es indispensable para el desarrollo económico y social. Más aún, expertos en el tema señalan que la diferencia en el nivel de educación y cultura marca la diferencia entre los países (mucho más que otro factor).
¡De allí la importancia de los libros!         
Riesgos y desafíos
Es necesario que los posibles colaboradores entiendan que las necesidades no hijo solo materiales; que, también importantes son las cosas derivadas de la condición dual del ser humano.
Por eso, se debe insistir durante la campaña en las ventajas que se puede obtener con el desarrollo de la educación y la cultura. Y se debe mostrar el ejemplo de otros países del mundo. 
A través de los medios de comunicación y de las redes se pueden difundir estas ideas. Y también a través de contactos personales      
 Puedes ayudar de otras formas

 Pedimos a quienes no pueden colaborar con los recursos económicos que difunden los propósitos y características de esta campaña. Eso también es muy útil

<p><strong><i>Syn Festival Edinburgh</i></strong> is a multi-arts festival for emerging Scotland-based artists so they can promote their work to wider audiences here in the capital! This year we are celebrating our 6th birthday! So far we’ve supported a variety of arts such as photography, painting, illustration, film, mapping projections, theatre, dance, music and more.</p>
<p><strong><i>Who are we?</i> </strong>We’re a bunch of art, theatre, music &amp; movie lovers. We’re passionate about creativity &amp; diversity. And most of all, we’re all volunteers.</p>
<p><strong><i>Why do we do this?</i> </strong>We believe there’re so many creative souls out there whose talent is worth a stage as well as so many people in this city eager to discover something new by attending free events. Yes, you heard it right: all <strong>Syn Festival events are free to attend</strong> and we intend to keep it so.</p>
<p>This is why we need your support. If you love the arts, if you are part of the creative community or a great fan of it, if you simply want to see more outstanding free events in Edinburgh, then this call is for you! Help us make the 2019 edition of the Syn Festival an even bigger and better hub for artists and the local community of Edinburgh. Make a donation today and share this video within your network. Even the smallest contribution will make an impact on the success of this festival. </p>

<p><i><strong>More about Syn Festival </strong></i></p>
<p>Syn means “with” or “together with”, as well as signifying mathematical addition in Greek. As a noun it translates as a pro, as opposed to a con. Syn Festival, which started in Edinburgh in 2014, constitutes a multi-arts festival which promotes intercultural dialogue. Taking into consideration that Edinburgh and Scotland in general are considerably multicultural areas, Syn, through various art, music, cinema and theatre events, brings to the fore the cultural discourse between South and North, the Mediterranean and Great Britain. To date, Syn has hosted five festivals in various venues of the city (Upper Church at Summerhall, Adam House, Teviot Row House, Out of the Blue Drill Hall) showcasing local creative talent.</p>
<p>Syn started in 2014 as an initiative of the Edinburgh University Hellenic Society, but since then our team has grown by students and professionals from a diverse range of cultural and professional backgrounds joining our volunteers team and/or our organising committee. Throughout the years, Syn has forged links with the Drama Short Film Festival (Greece), Be-There Corfu Animation Festival (Greece), Alba New Music Festival (Edinburgh), Edinburgh Greek Film Festival, Rebetiko Carnival (London) and the Italian Studies, University of Edinburgh. Syn Festival is a purely volunteer led organisation and prioritises on making art accessible to all by 'entry by donation' events. Additionally, each year, fundraising is held during the festival in support of vulnerable social groups such as refugees and the homeless. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Our Story</u></h3>
<p>Hi there! My name is Rachel Berger and I am the founder of the Artist Co-op.  I'm an actor, writer and blogger in New York City. My passion to create the Artist Co-op came out of a a passion to bring the artist community together.</p>
<p>With the rise of coworking spaces across America, I realized that the arts community was lagging behind in this new development.</p>
<p>New York City is the cultural capital of the world, if we can create the Artist Co-op here, I believe it will spread into other major cities like L.A., Detroit, Chicago, Miami and Austin!</p>
<p>I want to thank you in advance for believing in the project. Because of your support we will be able to create a community of artists, businesses that help each other! </p>

Our Story
Hi there! My name is Rachel Berger and I am the founder of the Artist Co-op.  I'm an actor, writer and blogger in New York City. My passion to create the Artist Co-op came out of a a passion to bring the artist community together.
With the rise of coworking spaces across America, I realized that the arts community was lagging behind in this new development.
New York City is the cultural capital of the world, if we can create the Artist Co-op here, I believe it will spread into other major cities like L.A., Detroit, Chicago, Miami and Austin!
I want to thank you in advance for believing in the project. Because of your support we will be able to create a community of artists, businesses that help each other! 
""The fun for me in collaboration is: working with other people just makes you smarter; that's proven."" ~Lin-Manuel Miranda

""Jazz in itself is not struggling. That is, the music itself is not struggling... It's the attitude that's in trouble. My plays insist that we should not forget or toss away our history."" ~August Wilson
Challenges
I realize this is a crazy thing to start in the most expensive city in the world but why not ... if the National Endowment for the Arts is being threatened under the current administration, ""Art reflects the values, aspirations, and questions of a culture; it’s a mechanism for a society to articulate how it imagines itself."" ~ Andy Horwitz

“If art is to nourish the roots of our culture, society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him.” –John F. Kennedy, former American President

<h3>The Project: </h3>
<p>Whether it is coaching women on or off the field, Lizzy Mair is heavily involved in the local soccer association and initiated her life-long passion with the sport by coaching a “girls-only” soccer camp in her hometown, Salmon Arm, for the past 22 years.  After years of participating in the camp, as well as playing for Salmon Arm in a competitive organized soccer league, her daughter Kairo Mair volunteered and was eventually employed as a coach to help inspire and train other young female soccer players.</p>
<p>Through their time playing soccer they have learned valuable life skills that will carry on into their careers, relationships and overall lifestyles. Kairo has been fortunate enough to have been empowered as an athlete and as a female, with the help of such strong female role models in their community, such as her coach and mother Lizzy.  Kairo and Lizzy want to continue this tradition of empowering young females on a global spectrum.</p>

<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>We are hoping to raise $3, 500 in order to help purchase these items for the Akonjo Village:</p>

<li>Soccer Balls</li>
<li>Soccer Jersey's </li>
<li>Running shoes </li>

<li>School Supplies </li>
<li>Soccer Nets</li>
</ul>
<p>Any extra funds will go towards helping develop the local school in the Akonjo village. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Intention: </h3>
<p>Through playing organized soccer Lizzy, Kairo and Libby, have had many empowering experiences and they want to pass these experiences on to young women in marginalized environments.</p>
<p>Team sports can help girls develop leadership skills, reliance, confidence, and self-esteem, which are all very important traits that they hope to convey through this camp. On top of developing and encourage female participation, they want to advocate the importance of physical activity and maintaining a healthy lifestyle through the power of sport. The main objective of the camp in Canada, stresses all participants to have fun, so on top of all the possible takeaways, pure enjoyment will be the number one priority.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This year’s tour plans to build on the success of last year’s MPF performance at the University of Maine in Orono, which represented the first time the festival, open to any resident throughout the state, had been performed outside of Portland.  Due in part to last year’s expansion efforts, the 2018 festival received scripts from a record number of Maine-based playwrights this fall (62 in all).  Acorn’s aim with this tour is to make sure that, if selected, any writer, their friends and family would have the opportunity to see their work in its world premiere production without having to travel to Portland, where the regular performance run will be held in the Studio Theater at 25A Forest Avenue April 26 to May 5.  Connecting the MPF to more writers from across the state is an important part of the MPF’s mission.  As the number and geographic diversity of the MPF’s submissions continues to grow, the festival will be able better serve the artistic community by offering production opportunities to a wider diversity of writers from across the state.  This campaign will also provide key seed funding to initiate a planned long-term partnership with Penobscot Theater to showcase each year's selections in Bangor.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The budget for the Maine Playwrights Festival includes expenses directly related to the Bangor tour, such as the hard costs of transportation, housing, personnel, and marketing, as well as the soft costs of time and energy that will be needed to ensure the festival's design permits it to easily tour.  This campaign also helps to fund a pro-rated cost of the entire event's overhead.  Here are some specific details about what your contribution(s) would help fund:</p>
<p><strong>What the following will ""buy"" for the Maine Playwrights Festival</strong></p>
<p>$25 – covers travel reimbursement for one carpool of actors to Bangor</p>
<p>$50 – hires a local technician for load-in in Bangor</p>
<p>$75 – hires for one actor for the festival run</p>
<p>$100 – covers additional marketing and publicity for the Bangor performance</p>
<p>$250 – purchases costumes and set pieces for the festival production</p>
<p>$500 – covers U-haul rental and gas to transport sets &amp; costumes to Bangor</p>
<p>$800 – rents the theater to perform in Portland for one week</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How It Helps</h3>Producing the Maine Playwrights Festival is a stretch for a grassroots, non-profit company like Acorn, but every year we are able to do it thanks to the generous support of people in our community.  Every dollar raised from this campaign goes directly to help produce the festival and support the tour to Bangor.  If we are unable to meet our goal, not only would the tour to Bangor not take place, we would also have to consider scaling back future editions of the MPF and making artistic compromises to keep it viable.  Acorn's entire budget for the season is less than $50,000, so every donation really does make a difference in the company's ability to produce the MPF every year.<p> </p>

<h3>The Plays</h3>
<p>Here are the brand new works chosen to be a part of this year's Maine Playwrights Festival.  Your donation supports this work, and the overall work of all playwrights in the state by keeping the MPF thriving!</p>
<p><strong><u>Featured Plays:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>BOY MISSING</i></strong><strong>, by Travis G. Baker</strong> In a small-town bar, Darcy and Jerry are going to have a ‘conversation’ about the missing boy who connects their families.</p>
<p><strong><i>KNOCKS AND HOW TO ANSWER</i></strong><strong>,  by Ron Kanecke</strong> Two lonely people at crossroads in their lives meet during a hurricane evacuation.</p>
<p><strong><i>GESUNDHEIT</i></strong><strong>,  by Parker Lemal-Brown</strong> After deciding out of the blue that he’s on his deathbed, a father’s cavalier attitude towards illness – and giving away his possessions – drives his daughter to desperation.</p>
<p><strong><i>ANGELS WE HAVE HEARD,</i>  by Gordon LePage</strong> After the arrival of an unexpected young guest, a successful New York real estate agent must appraise the value of her properties past and present.</p>
<p><strong><i>SLEEPING AT CAMPOBELLO</i></strong><strong>,  by Jennifer Reck</strong> Historical artifacts get borrowed and broken as the summer season at Campobello draws to a close, and a docent finds herself in a compromising position in the Roosevelts’ bedroom.</p>
<p><strong><u>Semi-Finalist Scripts:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>HIPPOS IN THE CATHOLIC SCHOOL PARKING LOT</i></strong><strong>, by David Body</strong> Two befuddled school administrators try to cope with a sudden crisis: the surprising appearance of two leathery, gray hippos in their parking lot.</p>
<p><strong><i>THE OTHER LIFE, </i></strong><strong> by Lynne Cullen</strong> After waking from a coma, a woman begins to doubt the reality of her life, and her marriage.</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A major goal of the MPF is to lift the level of playwriting across the state. Maine’s playwriting community is slowly growing, but writers have very few opportunities in-state to work on honing their craft, and few established paths to connect with successful, mid-career writers to serve as role models for dedication and ongoing artistic growth.  The MPF offers selected playwrights the chance to workshop their pieces with Callie Kimball, this year’s Playwright-in-Residence, as well as the chance to receive audience feedback over the course of the 7 performances in Portland and one planned performance in Bangor.  Expanding the festival to include a performance at PTC will not only provide playwrights with the chance to engage a whole new audience base in the work being created by Maine playwrights and get feedback from new artists and audience members.  A successful performance in Bangor during the 2018 MPF will inspire more writers in eastern, central, and northern Maine to consider writing and submitting new plays in future cycles (for 2019 and after), thus increasing the geographic diversity of the festival and expanding opportunities for writers from these parts of the state.  The tour will also help to forge ongoing relationships with playwrights in those areas with Penobscot Theater to hold future performances in Bangor.</p>

Written by Norwegian designers Tor Kjetil Edland and Hanne Grasmo and first played in 2011, it has quickly traveled around the world - Norway, Sweden, Denmark, France and US -  and the hype is high. We're now bringing in to Finland for the first time, from June 5th-10th, 2018.</p><h3>Needs</h3><p>Larp running isn’t cheap. Just a Little Lovin’ is runs 6 days including workshops, and has relatively high production values. A big budget results in expensive tickets and reduced financial accessibility to players. Our tickets cost 275 euros, which, for a 6-day event including accommodation, is pretty great. But it will still be prohibitively expensive for some people, and those include people who we think really <i>ought </i>to have a chance to play this larp. </p><p>That’s why we crowdfund – to offer subsidised tickets to players in a weaker financial situation. If we sold our tickets on a first-come, first-served basis, we could have easily offered tickets in several price categories. We decided instead to do a player selection to achieve better diversity in our players by nationality, larp experience, age, gender expression, and sexual orientation. The US run of JaLL prioritised players who were either LGBTQIA+, directly affected by the HIV epidemic, persons of colour, and/or have a low income. We will do the same.</p><p>A subsidized ticket will cost 175 euros, which can also be paid in parts. Our main goal is to fund at least 10 of these tickets. If we manage to crowdfund a even bigger amount of money, we use the rest to give a bigger leeway to our amazing set designer Tonja and lighting designer Essi. Any possible money left over will be donated to LarpFund or Hiv-säätiö (Finland's HIV association).<br/><br/>Approximately every 105 euros raised gives us about 1 subsidised ticket more for a person in need. About 5 euros goes to service fees, 100 euros on the ticket. We do have some another expenses, but basically that’s it. And if you can't donate that much – well, every euro matters.<br/><br/>We get nothing for this apart from the kudos of doing it. Our team works for free and the money we raise goes straight to subsidising tickets after we pay the Indiegogo service fees and any material expenses from perks.</p><h3>Benefits</h3><p>Can you spare 5 euros? Great! You'll get credit on our website as a supporter (under your own name, a nickname, or anonymously), and a special digital drawing by our set designer, Tonja Goldblatt. She promises gay rainbow cats in leather pants!<br/><br/>15 euros? Thank you! You'll get a <i>personalised</i> doodle from Tonja, credits on the site, and a sew-on Just a Little Lovin' patch.</p><p>We are currently arranging a fundraising draglesque club night in Helsinki, featuring local drag artists and queer stand-up comedy. A 20 euro donation gets you an early bird ticket to the event - plus a patch and credits on the site. There are also a couple VIP tickets, where you get all the above plus a photo session with Jamie, whose Polariod SX-70 camera screams 1980s authenticity.<br/><br/>If you live farther away, 30 euros gets you the patch and a personal video thank-you message from the organiser team that we can post on your FB, or just send to you. If you are a true 80s soul at heart and prefer original art to digital copies, 50 euros will get you an original gay leather rainbow cat drawing by Tonja.</p><p>We produce this run with Nordic Roleplaying Society. They donated books for us to offer as perks. You can check their publications out here: <a href=""http://www.nordicrpg.fi/julkaisut/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nordicrpg.fi/julkaisut/</a></p><p><br/>Finally, our largest donations get some amazing experiences! A donation of 100 euros will get you and 4 friends your own run of JaLL's little sister, I Say a Little Prayer. It's based on the same events, but is a shorter game you can play in an evening. Our own experienced team will run it for you.<br/><br/>200 euros will get you your own personal drag coaching from House of Vanilla alumna HyperFemme. Get started creating your drag persona, or get coaching on a number you're already working on. Online or in person!</p><p>We will do this as a flexible campaign to reach the goal in any case.</p><h3>Risks</h3><p>If we don’t manage to raise money for subsidised tickets, we only sell the regular priced ones. It won’t affect whether the larp happens in any way, only who might be able to be there. If we crowdfund well, however, we will be very happy as we would have not only supported tickets but a bigger budget to work with for an even more immersive, memorable experience. </p><p>If you have anything you want to ask from us or want more information about the perks just drop us a message or send an email to jallfinland@gmail.com. Can't a donate? You can help us to succeed - share our campaign with your friends!</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","BasicsJust a Little Lovin' is one of the best known larps from Nordic larp genre, offering an immersive experience of friendship, desire, and the fear of death through three 4th of July parties in 1982, 1983 and 1984.

The US run of JaLL prioritised players who were either LGBTQIA+, directly affected by the HIV epidemic, persons of colour, and/or have a low income. We will do the same.A subsidized ticket will cost 175 euros, which can also be paid in parts. Our main goal is to fund at least 10 of these tickets. If we manage to crowdfund a even bigger amount of money, we use the rest to give a bigger leeway to our amazing set designer Tonja and lighting designer Essi. Any possible money left over will be donated to LarpFund or Hiv-säätiö (Finland's HIV association).Approximately every 105 euros raised gives us about 1 subsidised ticket more for a person in need. About 5 euros goes to service fees, 100 euros on the ticket. We do have some another expenses, but basically that’s it. And if you can't donate that much – well, every euro matters.We get nothing for this apart from the kudos of doing it. Our team works for free and the money we raise goes straight to subsidising tickets after we pay the Indiegogo service fees and any material expenses from perks.BenefitsCan you spare 5 euros? Great! You'll get credit on our website as a supporter (under your own name, a nickname, or anonymously), and a special digital drawing by our set designer, Tonja Goldblatt. She promises gay rainbow cats in leather pants!15 euros? Thank you! You'll get a personalised doodle from Tonja, credits on the site, and a sew-on Just a Little Lovin' patch.We are currently arranging a fundraising draglesque club night in Helsinki, featuring local drag artists and queer stand-up comedy. A 20 euro donation gets you an early bird ticket to the event - plus a patch and credits on the site. There are also a couple VIP tickets, where you get all the above plus a photo session with Jamie, whose Polariod SX-70 camera screams 1980s authenticity.If you live farther away, 30 euros gets you the patch and a personal video thank-you message from the organiser team that we can post on your FB, or just send to you. If you are a true 80s soul at heart and prefer original art to digital copies, 50 euros will get you an original gay leather rainbow cat drawing by Tonja.We produce this run with Nordic Roleplaying Society. They donated books for us to offer as perks. You can check their publications out here: http://www.nordicrpg.fi/julkaisut/Finally, our largest donations get some amazing experiences! A donation of 100 euros will get you and 4 friends your own run of JaLL's little sister, I Say a Little Prayer. It's based on the same events, but is a shorter game you can play in an evening. Our own experienced team will run it for you.200 euros will get you your own personal drag coaching from House of Vanilla alumna HyperFemme. Get started creating your drag persona, or get coaching on a number you're already working on. Online or in person!We will do this as a flexible campaign to reach the goal in any case.RisksIf we don’t manage to raise money for subsidised tickets, we only sell the regular priced ones. It won’t affect whether the larp happens in any way, only who might be able to be there. If we crowdfund well, however, we will be very happy as we would have not only supported tickets but a bigger budget to work with for an even more immersive, memorable experience. If you have anything you want to ask from us or want more information about the perks just drop us a message or send an email to jallfinland@gmail.com. Can't a donate? You can help us to succeed - share our campaign with your friends!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Celebrating 10 Years of Sounds and Colours</h3>
<p>To celebrate 10 years of Sounds and Colours we were planning a big party this year. That’s not going to happen any more... but we are launching this fundraiser to make Sounds and Colours an even better resource for cutting-edge Latin American music and culture, and ensure our survival as we battle with a severe drop in advertising revenue.</p>
<p>One of the hardest things about this lockdown has been trying to figure out how life now works while also helping support as many projects as possible. It's been tough, but has made us realise how much Latin artists need media that they can trust and that fully supports their endeavours. It's for that reason that we felt it essential that we carried on with this campaign (which we had been planning since last year) and help ensure that we can continue to support Latin music and culture for another 10 years.</p>
<p>As part of our anniversary celebrations we're releasing two brand new projects, a downloadable compilation (which is OUT NOW) and a brand new book filled with articles and photos documenting Latin culture, which will be released in August 2020. We're selling copies of our compilation and book as part of this fundraiser as well as a collection of amazing perks donated by our friends and supporters, and some extra special items from the Sounds and Colours archives.</p>
<p>Read on to find out more...</p>
<p><strong>Sounds and Colours: 10 Years Compilation</strong></p>
<p>The compilation, <i><strong>Sounds and Colours: 10 Years</strong></i> is available now and features new, rare and unreleased music from Orkesta Mendoza + Mexican Institute of Sounds + Calexico, Kassin, Monte (the new project of Bomba Estereo’s Simón Mejía), Cabruêra, Romperayo, Mȁ̲̠̻ͥ̾ra͔̥̩̾͊̑cuyá͊, Santi &amp; Tuğçe, Numa Gama, Santiago Córdoba, ESDLCP, DJ Mam, NILLO, M. Takara &amp; Carla Boregas (RAKTA), Cineplexx, Kif, Maria Rita Stumpf, Dolli, Sentidor, Savan, Lulina, Tongas &amp; Mates, El Buga, Kumbia Obscura and Pernett.</p>
<p>You can listen to the compilation at <a href=""https://soundsandcolours.bandcamp.com/album/sounds-and-colours-10-years-anniversary-compilation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bandcamp</a> and buy it there, or in conjunction with some perks right here.</p>
<p><strong>Sounds and Colours: 10 Years Book</strong></p>
<p>We are also releasing the <strong><i>Sounds and Colours: 10 Years</i></strong> book which will feature 100 pages of brand new content, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>special reporting on the protests that have engulfed many Latin American countries over the past 12 months (with text and photos from contributors in Bolivia, Chile and Colombia)</li>
<li>feature on the female producers breaking ground in electronic music in São Paulo</li>
<li>story on the impact of Mexico City's water crisis and how creativity and culture are being used to find a solution</li>
<li>an oral history of champeta, as told by the musicians, DJs and important figures who have helped champion the Colombian style since the beginning</li>
<li>the continuing tales of Brazilian soul legend Tim Maia, with new stories from Allen Thayer, the definitive authority on Maia (and Brazilian funk and soul in general)</li>
<li>a look back at the work of the influential Bolivian film-maker Jorge Sanjinés and his Grupo Ukamau collective</li>
<li>when strikes hit Colombia last year many musicians raised their voice in support - we take a look at how musicians played a role in this social movement, and to what end</li>
<li>a spotlight on the work of some of Bolivia's finest artists, who also share their thoughts on current social disruption in the country</li>
<li>we take a look at three social activist organisations in Colombia empowering young Colombians, who increasingly feel marginalised by society, through culture</li>
<li>plus, a retrospective of the best Latin films, books and music that have been released over Sounds and Colours' 10 years of existence</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are looking to generate £5,000 to make the following happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>improve our website</strong> – a long-overdue update to create the ultimate resource for Latin American music and culture. We will make content easier to find, fix errors and improve the look – we’ve already got some very nice original illustrations from Lee Hodges to help in that department. There are thousands of articles, including important research into Latin culture on our site, but it's not easy to find. We need to resolve that. We are looking for a budget of £1,200 to get this update over the line.</li>
<li>
<strong>publish 10th Anniversary book</strong> - this campaign is partly a pre-order for our <i>Sounds and Colours: 10 Years </i>book, for which we will be looking to put £2,000 towards the cost of printing the book and paying our writing team</li>
<li>
<strong>launch a membership scheme</strong> – to be able to offer premium content (i.e. podcasts, in-depth research articles, online film screenings) we will need a steady flow of income and are proposing a membership scheme to pay for that content. More details will be announced soon, but our plan requires a budget for initial costs as we look to build our subscribers. We are therefore planning to generate a £1,000 initial budget to subsidise the project in its early stages. <i>As an added bonus of this campaign everyone who buys any perk will get a month’s subscription for free.</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>keep running Sounds and Colours as we are</strong> – compensating for the drop in advertising revenue, a modest budget of £800 will help us to keep the website running at moderate speed for the following months as we wait for the live events, whose advertising we rely on, to come back into our lives</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>There is much on offer. As well as being able to buy the <i>Sounds and Colours: 10 Years</i> compilation, and pre-order the <i>10 Years Book</i>, we are also selling donations very generously given to us by:</p>

<h2>Hey there!</h2>
<p>My name is Maggie, and I'm a professional violinist and educator in New York City.</p>
<p>I've been teaching violin for over ten years, and along with my teaching colleagues, I've noticed a gap in instrumental instruction in our city. So many of our young, Suzuki violin students take private lessons in their own homes, and they miss the experience of playing in a group class with other children (which is a crucial component of Suzuki method learning!) Our students and their families expressed the desire to play their instruments with other learners, particularly in convenient locations. With this need grew the idea for Bow &amp; Heart.</p>
<p>Bow &amp; Heart is a group class program that serves as a collective of Suzuki students, their teachers, and their families. We meet in community arts centers and schools in locations throughout New York City, celebrating our communities' assets while playing our instruments together. We build our confidence and motivation and open our eyes and ears to one another, working to string together our musical communities while developing a deeper love for the violin.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need </h2>
<p>At Bow &amp; Heart, we charge our students a minimal fee to attend classes. This means it's crucial for us to raise funds in order to pay our teachers for their hard work! Additionally, for us to bring instruction to many communities throughout New York City, we need contributions to help us book class venues and purchase class supplies. Finally, we're building-in a ""guest artist"" component to our classes, where we'll bring in some of NYC's finest artists to help show our students all the capabilities of their music making.</p>
<p>Here's a breakdown of what your contribution can do for us:</p>
<ul>
<li>$20 pays for a Suzuki method book or post-class snack</li>
<li>$50 pays for two music stands for class</li>
<li>$75 provides payment to one of our teachers per class</li>
<li>$100 covers the fee for class rental space</li>
<li>$200 provides payment for a guest artist </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Any funds raised beyond $4,000 will help us continue our classes over the summer and next fall, and expand our program to even more neighborhoods!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What You Get</h2>
<p>We'd be <i>incredibly</i> grateful for your support. We'll let you know exactly where your contribution's going, and each support level has a different perk: invitations to guest artist classes, an arrangement of your chosen song performed by our faculty, a thank-you from our students, and more!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>There's something pretty great that happens when we play our instruments alongside one another. Along with making beautiful music, we develop an awareness of the sights and sounds coming from our neighbors. We move from what may seem like an isolating experience to a joyfully inclusive one. And along the way, we build a musical community that can be a lasting one.</p>
<p>When I was little, I looked forward to Suzuki group class as much as I did a birthday party. I knew I'd share music with my friends, learn something new, and have a blast doing it. Our teachers at Bow &amp; Heart share these similar experiences and want to create a space for young violinists to do the same.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>We're so happy you're here to learn about us, even if you can't contribute to our fund! We'd appreciate any help in spreading the word. You can always: </p>
