<p><strong>About <i>Girls Night Out</i></strong></p>
<p>Girls' Night Out is a short narrative film about two best friends, Andrea and Jen, who decide to join an old colleague for drinks at a nightclub in San Francisco. Like any other night out at the club, the girls are drinking and having a good time. Their night suddenly goes south when one of the girls is drugged.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why This Story?</strong></p>
<p>Date Rape is a very misleading term, which describes a serious crime that is wrongfully perceived and often not reported. Date rape and other sexual violence cases are major public health, human rights, and social justice issues. We're here to address this issue and raise awareness in hopes of reaching out to everyone, both men and women who have been victims, potential victims, as well as potential predators. </p>
<p>As someone who has gone through a horrifying and traumatic experience of being drugged and sexually assaulted, and after years of keeping it to myself, I would like others who are currently suffering with post-traumatic stress/depression to understand that if you talk about it, speak up and let it out, you too, can heal. Don't continue to carry on those negative emotions. Though it may have changed your views, you are not your experience. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>Our goal is to raise a total of $3000. Donations will help our campaign develop all stages of the film including production, post-production, marketing, and film festival fees.</p>

For us, filmmaking is as much about advocacy as it is entertainment. HALLOWED GROUND is part of that idea and mission. It has never been more important that artists, especially in Mississippi, but also around the country, demonstrate just how open, how all-embracing, how inclusive and how poignant the arts have been and continue to be.

Independent films, so often great labors of love that a filmmaker has literally willed into existence, deserve to be championed and seen just as much as the latest Hollywood tentpole, perhaps more so. We make films that we hope demand to be seen, films that can find champions, films that can find a home among a wider audience and, when they do so, to entertain, to inspire, to unnerve and to make those audiences think, at least for a moment, about the nature of what it means to be human, about why they believe what they believe.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516211305/erppoougc6bl3fz6i0ig.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;-&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</h3><h3>Where Your Contributions Go</h3><p>As independent filmmakers, we greatly value every contribution and won't let a single dollar go to waste.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Casey Schoch and I am a female filmmaker at Ithaca College finishing off my junior year. </p>
<p>""Your Loving, Virginia"" showcases not only the thought process of Virginia Woolf, but the traumas she was faced with every day and the toll it weighed on her. Upon her death, Virginia Woolf  was ridiculed for being a weak woman, reporters claiming she simply could not handle the stress of the looming war. However, it is through her husband's unconditional devotion to her that we see another side of her, the true terror she was met with. Through this film, we live through Virginia's last day with her, exploring the world she created for herself surrounded by the characters she created as a tribute to the people she loved most.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Because this is a time period piece, the majority of our funding will be put towards recreating this setting through recreating her home and depicting the authenticity of the settings of her books. </li>
<li>Since we will also be supplying food for our cast and crew for the number of days we are filming, we are accounting for that price as well.</li>
<li>The final cost comes down to the prices for film festival submissions as we are confident even now in pre-production that this project holds a beautiful message and extreme promise.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you can help create a voice for women who have been silenced because of their gender or even their mental health. Virginia Woolf lived with manic depression, an illness not yet understood by the world to the degree it is today. By telling her story, Virginia Woolf can live on to give support for anyone suffering from the harshness of reality, too, and serve as a driving force to empower women who have been put down for too long.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Casey Schoch and I am a female filmmaker at Ithaca College finishing off my junior year. 
""Your Loving, Virginia"" showcases not only the thought process of Virginia Woolf, but the traumas she was faced with every day and the toll it weighed on her. Upon her death, Virginia Woolf  was ridiculed for being a weak woman, reporters claiming she simply could not handle the stress of the looming war. However, it is through her husband's unconditional devotion to her that we see another side of her, the true terror she was met with. Through this film, we live through Virginia's last day with her, exploring the world she created for herself surrounded by the characters she created as a tribute to the people she loved most.

What We Need & What You Get

Because this is a time period piece, the majority of our funding will be put towards recreating this setting through recreating her home and depicting the authenticity of the settings of her books. 
Since we will also be supplying food for our cast and crew for the number of days we are filming, we are accounting for that price as well.
The final cost comes down to the prices for film festival submissions as we are confident even now in pre-production that this project holds a beautiful message and extreme promise.


The Impact
By contributing to this campaign, you can help create a voice for women who have been silenced because of their gender or even their mental health. Virginia Woolf lived with manic depression, an illness not yet understood by the world to the degree it is today. By telling her story, Virginia Woolf can live on to give support for anyone suffering from the harshness of reality, too, and serve as a driving force to empower women who have been put down for too long.
As a female filmmaker, I am driven to creating projects with the voices of powerful women. It is my goal to sufficiently represent women in films, no matter the genre. My last film, Dead Weight, showcased the mind of a woman in a suspense film, and the film generated a huge film festival appeal. Moving forward with this non-fiction piece for this extraordinary author, I have no doubt that this story will hold even more ground.
Mental illness and gender inequality are prevalent now more than ever, and it is our job as visual creators to strive for representation in this medium.

Risks & Challenges

Because this film is a time period piece, it will be nothing without the authenticity of our production and costume design. The inability to fulfill these needs will result in an injustice to Virginia's lifetime of achievements, an obstacle we refuse to overlook. 
We will also be battling the Ithaca elements as we move to film Virginia's last moments, but our safety team is prepared to undergo all necessary precautions to ensure that everyone is safe on set.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>My name is Devon Coull the writer/producer and lead actor behind the film Recondition. I'm a bi-coastal actor working mainly out of the Los Angeles, and Boston markets. While catching my dreams I've watched close relatives and friends from my hometown fall victim to the heroin/opiod crisis that is destroying families in a lot of small cities across the country. I wrote Recondition my first short film and started my own business Reconditioned Images LLC this year to develop great stories of triumph and struggle and get them to the screen.</p>
<p>Last year I ran an Indiegogo campaign and raised 75% of our overall budget goal allowing us to roll into pre-production, but now we need help to finish our film.  So far we've managed to assemble a major league cast and crew and have filmed our story. Now its time to edit it and get it out to our great supporters. Post production costs are all we have left in completing this amazing story of a mans struggle with temptation and addiction.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact is Very Important!</h3>
<p>As much as it'd be great for a high dollar contribution its more important to us that we receive smaller donation, and that your share this campaign with your friends. The more eyes that see this campaign and eventually the finished film the closer we get to achieving our goal of influencing a person in need.</p>

<p>If your budget is tight all we can ask is that you please spread the word of our project. Thank you so much for your generous support.</p>

<h3>Devon Coull</h3>
<p>Meet Jack Sawyer himself. Devon is the lead actor/writer/producer of Recondition. Along the way hes had some great opportunities. In 2013 he was directed by the great Frank Darabont in his TNT series Mob City. Frank is the mastermind behind The Shawshank Redemption, Green Mile, and AMC Walking Dead series. In 2016 luck struck again being rewarded with a small role in CBS's American Gothic directed by Matt Shakman known for directing It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Acting is Devon's passion, but when not on set hes usually getting his hands dirty working full-time for Mack/Volvo Trucks as a Diesel Technician. <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm4658506"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.imdb.com/name/nm4658506</a></p>

<h3>Graham Patrick Martin</h3>
<p>Recondition's director is no other than highly talented Graham Martin series regular ""Rusty"" of TNT's Major Crimes. Some of you may recognize him as ""Eldridge"" from Two and a Half Men. Graham is such a major league player in our project. He not only supported the original campaign, but he took it a step further and decided to take the drivers seat in our project as the director. At a young age of 26, his years behind the camera on various shows has given our project the precision laser focus our movie needed. I'm really fascinated to work close with him, and being many young people are suffering from this epidemic its nice to have someone in charge that is also the same age.

<p>The extremely gifted NYC stage and television actor Paul Guilfoyle, known for his role as ""Jim Brass"" on 319 episodes of CSI Crime Scene Investigation jumped on board Recondition to play Gerry Sanders grandfather to Jack Sawyer.

Brad Carter is such an amazing soul. If one positive thing comes from this movie outside of helping others.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Due to a life-long fascination with outer space, Arron Kinser has always wondered if we were alone in the universe, and after traveling the globe he discovered that this curiosity is inherent in all human beings. Then, while traveling through the Mojave Desert, the question dawned on him: How do the world's religions, both ancient and new, answer that curiosity? What's more, do they tend to believe these visitors Extraterrestrials, Demons, or Angels?</p>
<p>Mesopotamian, Inuit, Asian, Indian, and European religions vary in their interpretations of global phenomena, so what might they all have to say about extraterrestrial life forms? Our goal is to answer that question by talking to as many leaders and followers of these religions as possible; to find out what similarities and differences arise in the perception of drawings, writings, and even first-hand accounts of Alien visitation.</p>
<p>This documentary will consist of our crew traveling the continental US and visiting both religious and UFO-sighting hotbeds, complete with interviews, archival footage, dramatic re-enactments, and coverage of some of the most exclusive filming locations known to experts in the field.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us share the knowledge we receive, with the goals of ushering in a better understanding of what life may exist beyond our planet, discovering how our perception of that life has affected religion, culture, and history, and perhaps even demonstrating that while religious beliefs as a whole may differ, their interpretation of this undeniable phenomena may serve as common ground.</p>

<p>Our fundraising goal is $20,000, which will help cover fuel and maintenance for our mobile production studio, (otherwise known as Arron's decked-out RV) contributions to various organizations that will provide either information or filming permits, production and post-production expenses, and server/distribution costs so that we can provide the documentary to viewers on our own terms. If we do not reach this goal, we will complete the documentary to the best of our ability with what we have raised.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For as long as written history has existed, humans have asked, ""How did we get here? What is the meaning of life? Are we alone in the Universe?""</p>
<p>Religion has always been the balm to these burning questions, so we want to find out where each individual religion stands in their belief of Extraterrestrial life, UFO phenomena, technological reverse-engineering.

Who believes these otherwordly visitors to be Demons, Angels, or Aliens?</p>
<p>Answering this question is just the tip of the iceberg, and if we are successful in this campaign we hope to delve even deeper into the history of Extraterrestrial encounters as they pertain to religion, and do so all around the planet.</p>

<p>We are hopeful that experts and laypeople alike will be willing to share their experiences and beliefs, but we also know that these beliefs can sometimes be controversial or hard to share.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Due to a life-long fascination with outer space, Arron Kinser has always wondered if we were alone in the universe, and after traveling the globe he discovered that this curiosity is inherent in all human beings. Then, while traveling through the Mojave Desert, the question dawned on him: How do the world's religions, both ancient and new, answer that curiosity? What's more, do they tend to believe these visitors Extraterrestrials, Demons, or Angels?
Mesopotamian, Inuit, Asian, Indian, and European religions vary in their interpretations of global phenomena, so what might they all have to say about extraterrestrial life forms? Our goal is to answer that question by talking to as many leaders and followers of these religions as possible; to find out what similarities and differences arise in the perception of drawings, writings, and even first-hand accounts of Alien visitation.
This documentary will consist of our crew traveling the continental US and visiting both religious and UFO-sighting hotbeds, complete with interviews, archival footage, dramatic re-enactments, and coverage of some of the most exclusive filming locations known to experts in the field.
Your contribution will help us share the knowledge we receive, with the goals of ushering in a better understanding of what life may exist beyond our planet, discovering how our perception of that life has affected religion, culture, and history, and perhaps even demonstrating that while religious beliefs as a whole may differ, their interpretation of this undeniable phenomena may serve as common ground.

<h2>About The Bob Zula</h2>
<p>My name is Brandon Reich and I’m a filmmaker based in Austin, Texas. The Bob Zula is a coming-of-age comedy based on my experiences growing up in East Texas. Ten years ago I made the original short film with the help of my family and friends. This year, I’m shooting my first feature film based on that short.</p>
<p>I studied film at the New York Film Academy, and later moved to Chicago to learn improv at The Second City and film at Columbia College Chicago. Since then, I’ve been freelancing as a filmmaker, and shooting shorts and sketches. I'm excited to be making my first feature film because this is an amazing challenge, and dream come true. A few coming-of-age comedies I love are American Graffiti, Rushmore, Superbad, and Rocket Science to name a few. They have influenced this project in that I have watched and been able to see aspects of my own life's successes and failures in the characters, and the most relatable are the relationships that are shared in those moments.</p>
<p>I’m excited to have a talented and passionate team involved in this project, many of whom were involved in the short ten years earlier. I am grateful for their willingness to donate their time, skills and resources to The Bob Zula, and to the art of motion pictures.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>As you know, making a movie isn’t cheap. It’s our goal to raise $20,000 for the following costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>$12,000 covers food costs</li>
<li>$15,000 covers food and gas</li>
<li>$17,000 covers food, gas, insurance and location permits</li>
<li>$20,000 covers all costs, plus stipends for the hardworking cast and crew</li>
</ul>
<p>We're passionate about this project and plan to make The Bob Zula no matter what, but anything you give will help fuel and encourage the team. Even if it's just a few dollars!</p>
<h3>Other Ways To Help</h3>
<p>If you can’t contribute financially, we still need your help spreading the word about this campaign and supporting us throughout the project! Follow the Indiegogo campaign here, share it on social media and subscribe to our newsletter to see how the project progresses.</p>

<h3>What is <i>A Dreamer</i>?</h3>
<p>Freddie, a passive, taciturn, naïve film student, dreams about finishing his screenplay while also hoping to reconnect with Audrey, an actress he met  during the summer. The screenplay he is writing, “Monochrome Fantasy,” is in fact a recollection of their memories, which he deems fit for the big screen. He hopes that his creative endeavor will impress Audrey and make her desire him.</p>
<h3>Director's Statement</h3>
<p>My name is Jeremy Gumener. I am a film student from Geneva, Switzerland, studying Film &amp; Media Studies and English at Tufts University. </p>
<p><i>A Dreamer</i> is an idea that I've been developing for the past year, a story I've taken my time to write and now finally have a chance to produce and direct. It's my first short film. It's a relatable story that will speak to anyone who has made the decision to follow through with their creative callings, and, paradoxically, to those who haven't, because of the unpredictability and lack of tangibility of such a dream. But this story also questions the essence of one's creative drive, as well as the genuine ""goal"" of an artist. Freddie idealizes what he believes to be Hollywood grandeur, and hopes that his creative ambitions will attract the attention of the woman he idolizes. But through his daydreams, we realize Freddie wants to make ""art"" for all the wrong reasons.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal for this project is to reach $3,900. This money will fund all stages of production, and will support props acquisition, locations rental, set design, crew &amp; cast fees, food and beverages for the entirety of the shoot, and post-production necessities such as sound mixing &amp; color grading, as well as festival submission fees. </p>
<p>Without your donations, we would not be able to afford certain locations, material, and personnel. The film would not come to life as we intend it to.</p>
<p>We believe that you deserve some unique perks for donating- The perks are listed on the right side of the page. Find the one that interests you most!</p>
<h3><strong>The Team</strong></h3>
<p>Meet our team- We all study a variety of subjects but are all passionate about film and photography. Our team has worked together before on various other projects, and can't wait to collaborate again on this one! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<p>WHO ARE YOU INVESTING IN?</p>
<p>Over a 23 year career, I have a proven track record of producing professional films at very low costs, both as a writer, director and an editor... </p>
<p>I've written and directed 75 short films/music videos/corporate videos and 1 feature film...</p>
<p>I also recently, edited sequences for the Martin Scorsese produced film 'Tomorrow'.</p>

<p>YELLOW JACKET (Trailer: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/170963459"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vimeo.com/170963459</a>) was my first micro-budget feature film which was made for £10,000 ...

<p>We've had such success with this film, that we decided to make another one the same way!!!</p>

<p>The story is a character driven drama, focused on a universal theme... fear - and how we can overcome those fears... all against the backdrop of a very ambitious Sci-Fi concept... Two young woman are trapped in the fallout, of a truly world changing natural event.</p>
<p>This film is also an opportunity, for two women to lead a feature film, with the male characters taking a 'back-seat' for a change. Developing female roles in film, is something I'm most passionate about.</p>
<p>It's an extremely personal project and to be able to tell the story and for others to then enjoy it... would be a personal and professional dream come true.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Tampa Beer: Crafting the Bay</i> is a love story to the Tampa Bay craft beer scene.  Tampa has a long history with beer; in fact, the first brewery in Florida was established here and is still standing.  The coolest thing about beer is that it means something completely different to everyone.  Beer is brewed in the same way, with the same ingredients, yet you give a recipe to 10 different brewers, you will get 10 different variations of that same beer.  Every beer has a journey from grains to glass and that drink you get at the bar is not just a beer, it's a beverage that has had multiple hands brew it - every beer starts with the farmer who supplies the grains to the brewer who throws them all together.  Our documentary features those people - the brewers that spend their lives brewing and learning and always getting better.  We meet many of the faces behind the beer and learn why they do what they do here in Tampa.  Tampa has recently exploded over the last few years in the sheer number of craft breweries opening up and has been dubbed ""the craft beer destination of the Southeast."" We learn what makes Tampa so special - so much so, that Yuengling's only brewery outside of Pennsylvania is here!  Every beer has a story and this is Tampa Bay's.</p>
<p>Like us, most of the craft beer drinkers don't really understand the drink.  People have always asked, <i>""Why is craft beer so expensive?""</i>  People drink beer quickly, slam the glass down and run off to the next brewery without really giving the drink much thought.  I filmed a short promotional video for a local brewery over three years ago and only then - meeting the people behind the drink, seeing the process that goes into creating this <i>""craft"" <i> </i></i>beverage - did I truly appreciate where it came from and what I was drinking.  I made it a point to create a film that not only showcases who these brewers are and the history that Tampa has with craft beer, but puts the drink back in the spotlight as one that people can appreciate when they drink it.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $20,000 to help us complete this film.  We were safely able to begin production in July of 2020 and have just completed filming.  But this is just the beginning.  Over the next few months, my team and I will begin editing all of our footage together to tell Tampa Bay's story.  Once we have our film edited together, we will be hiring a composer to create original music for the film, as well as a few other people that will be able to take this film to the next level.</p>
<p>The funds that we raise will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiring a composer to create an original score for our feature documentary</li>
<li>Hiring a sound designer to clean our interview audio and do ""soundscaping"", which is creating ambient noises, the popping of bubbles when an image of beer being poured is shown to really enhance the imagery</li>
<li>Securing Errors &amp; Omissions Insurance, marketing and submission to local and national film festivals and all associated legal fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we not receive our full $20,000 wish, the funds we have raised will be used for music composition and cleaning up the dialogue so that we can have a fully finished film.</p>
<p>And you will receive some AWESOME PERKS!  Everything from shirts only available to backer's of this campaign to movie posters to digital downloads and a ton of experiential rewards that will be sure to satisfy any craft beer lover!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This documentary is very special to me because it's been a passion of mine for the last two and a half years. I've always loved beer but I drank it just for taste and never really understood how it was made, what the ingredients were, or the hard work that someone had to go through to build the brewery that I'm sitting in, enjoying their lager or IPA.  But seeing the passion and hard work that these brewers have put into making sure I have this amazing experience with their beer really opened my eyes that there was a story to be told.</p>
<p>I've met some incredible people along this journey and saw how beer has truly changed their lives. It has given them the opportunity to make friendships and connection not only within the craft beer industry, but also within their community that they never would've made without beer.  It has benefitted the city and the local economy, provided jobs for thousands of people and put Tampa Bay on the map for having some of the best craft beer in the Southeast.</p>
<p>My hope with this documentary is that not only will it teach you what beer is and how it's brewed, but that you will gain an understanding of where that beer came from. That you will raise that glass to say ""thank you"" to the brewer that spent years learning how to perfect that beer so that you can enjoy it.</p>
<p>Our local craft beer scene helps the Tampa Bay economy and contributes to local business. My hope with this documentary is that we will be able to benefit the city and local community here in Tampa by showing the world that this is a craft beer destination and one that you want to check out first-hand!  Now more than ever, breweries need our help and support as they begin to recover from the effects of COVID-19.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The toughest challenge that we encountered with this documentary was-by far-filming during a global pandemic.  We successfully, and safely, completed filming, but now our challenge is delivering the best quality film to our audience.  Every step going forward will be easier as the remaining tasks and contributions can be completed without required physical proximity. However, we risk not having the funds to complete this process.  We are hopeful that there are enough people out there (like you!) that love craft beer or have even experienced Tampa Bay's craft beer scene, and that we'll be able to achieve our funding goal to be able to see this film through to completion.</p>

<h3><strong>SALVATION</strong></h3>
<p>Salvation revolves around a young tortured gay man who has deeply rooted religious values influenced by his father. The protagonist struggles to find happiness battling his father's homophobia as well as his own religious values due to which this feeling of his, towards the same gender or being a gay man is a <strong>big</strong> sin to him. So this conflict between his own feelings, his values &amp; beliefs, to be acceptable to his father and to get so-called salvation misleads him to become a psychopath.</p>

<li>Night at the Arcade is going to be a big hit all around the world, at least we hope. We're planning to film this short in August! Whoever likes cosplay, action movies, comedy, or fantasy is going to fall in love with this short. We are twin brothers who make epic films. We want to make a big short film that can bring our community together. So why do we need funding? My brother and I don't make money off of any of our short films. We want to pay everyone on set while pushing this to be a bigger film than our usual ones. </li>
<li>When it comes to cosplay-style films, there is so much copyright involved that we won't be making money off the film when it's complete. So we need a little bit of help so that we can pay for our actors, crews, food, and other crazy ideas that we can't yet reveal (don't want to ruin the movie). </li>

<h2>Scott Poggensee</h2>
<p>For many years, first-time filmmaker Scott Poggensee and a small group of friends and family waged something of a crusade in the defense of Brandon Woodruff. To help in their efforts Poggensee produced a documentary to show to supporters. In doing so he uncovered a series of lies and deception that bent the truth that led to the conviction of Brandon. This documentary will be used as the foundation of our series. In late 2020, Poggensee’s film came to the attention of Emmy winning journalist and documentarian Richard Ray. After examining the evidence, Ray agreed to help produce and write a documentary series. Since then both the Innocence Project of Texas and Lamda Legal have signed on, offering Brandon’s appellate lawyer assistance. The Free Brandon Woodruff movement grows by the day.</p>

<h2>Richard Ray</h2>
<p>Richard Ray is a five-time Emmy winning TV journalist and documentarian who spent 36 years as an Anchor/Reporter at KDFW-TV in Dallas/Fort Worth. He covered the Contra War in Central America and won Emmys for his coverage of the Oklahoma City bombing, the standoff at Waco and and the JFK assassination. He won numerous other awards, including those for his work on the Waco Standoff and the South Asia tsunami. Ray became interested in Brandon’s story in late 2020, after seeing Scott Poggensee’s rough cut documentary and listening to the American Justice Podcast. Ray’s examination of the evidence has since led him to join the movement to get to the truth.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Brandon Woodruff is a very sympathetic figure -- a sweet kid and class clown who was never in any serious trouble. He won scholarships for his skill in raising show animals. He loved caring for and riding horses. He was a budding actor and model. At 140 pounds and slightly built, it’s hard to see him committing the brutal crime he’s accused of. </p>
<p>By all accounts, he loved his parents and they loved him. In one, particularly poignant moment during a behind-bars interview Brandon explains how he feels his parents are still with him. “I’ve never been raped in here. I’ve never been seriously hurt,” Brandon tells Scott Poggensee. His parents, he believes, are with him in the penitentiary every day and protecting him. Brandon Woodruff has been behind bars for 15 years and counting. But he has never wavered in proclaiming his innocence. Brandon believes one day it will be proven. With your help, we can work faster to exonerate an innocent man.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We want to make it very clear -- this film will be made and will eventually expose the corruption and homophobic bias that was used to convict Brandon Woodruff of something he didn't do. Please help today so that we can make that sooner rather than later.</p>

</div></div>","In October 2005, authorities in Hunt County Texas discover Norma and Dennis Woodruff dead in their home, shot and stabbed repeatedly. A Texas Ranger quickly zeroes in on the couple’s son, Brandon Woodruff, after learning the young man was leading a double life. To High School and College friends he is still a fun-loving, horse-riding Urban Cowboy. But, he is also living a gay lifestyle, dancing at clubs in Dallas and acting in gay adult films.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Run is a tapestry of interconnected stories set against the coasts of southern England about how three young adults are confronted with loneliness, fear and trauma. </i></p>
<p>We don't want to give too much away at this point but we can tell you that we have been inspired by films like <i>Crash </i>and <i>Magnolia - </i>both of which follow many interwoven tales of mental health. Telling this story in a raw and honest way is so important. Run is not sugar-coated in anyway. It's tragic, yes, but also the reality for too many young people across the UK.</p>
<p>The three young adults we follow in Run are all strangers, yet converge on a similar path of seeking closure and moving on. Some find more success than others. These tales follow people that you won't expect suffering from worsening mental health conditions that infiltrate their lives. We want to show that mental illness doesn't discriminate. It latches onto anyone who is feeling remotely vulnerable. </p>

<p><u>Director's Statement:</u> Run is unlike any other film. We do not glorify mental health, we address it and observe it in its grittiest form. Who are we to give the answers of how to deal with abuse, depression, loneliness and addiction. This is not a film with an easy fix. Our film captures a snippet of the journey our characters go on. It will be up to the audience to decide of how they think the stories end or even if they have an end. We do not tell the audience how to think, we will simply put these stories forward and the audience can take whatever they like from it. Because we have no specific target audience for this film, every individual will take something different from it. That is our aim and the motivation that has inspired us to create this film.</p>
<p><u>Producer's Statement:</u>  I'm really wanting this film to encourage people to speak out about mental health and check up on their loved ones. I believe it is such an important message and I want people to know that they don't have to struggle on their own. I'm hoping our film can reach as many people as possible and change people's perception of the mental illnesses and troubles that we are addressing. 50% of our profits will be split between two fantastic charities close to our heart, helping people that I love dearly, and I am so happy to give back in an inspiring way. </p>

They are dedicated to supporting and helping all women and teenage girls address the impact of the trauma they have experienced and to reclaim the life they want for themselves. As strong advocates of women’s rights, they campaign for and champion change to make women’s lives better at both a local and national level.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>“We wanted to do a film that would directly impact our own community. This project is something we’d talked about doing a few times before and we came to the conclusion that the right time for it is now.” -<i>Born Logic, the director</i></p>
<p>In ""Walk on the River"" we touch on religion, politics, education, social organizations and community all in an attempt to paint a vivid picture of life for Black San Antonians in the past to help create a knowledge base, a sense of pride and a blueprint for the next generations moving forward.  This is the reason for this documentary.</p>
<h3><strong>Progress</strong></h3>
<p>Thus far we have compiled and conducted over 10 hours of interviews with professors, historians, business owners, educators and citizens.  </p>
<p>“Walk on the River” will feature very influential people from our community like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario Salas</li>
<li>Ed Glosson</li>
<li>Dr. Rudyard Hillard</li>
<li>Netti Henton</li>
<li>Lon Taylor</li>
<li>Vera Williams Young</li>
<li>D.L. Grant</li>
</ul>
<p>and many more</p>
<p>We’ve employed the help of researchers, students and volunteers to help read books, articles and newspaper clippings to gather information. We've collected more than 50 historical photos and digital images ranging from the 1870's to the 1980's. The documentary as it stands now is about 35% completed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Reaching our financial goals through this crowd funding campaign will help us complete this project this year (2018) and make it a high quality film. Recording a documentary is expensive, and much more intense than our first film.</p>
<p>Our goal is <strong>$9,150</strong>. This money will help us pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Legal fees</li>
<li>Research Materials and Resources</li>
<li>Video Production equipment</li>

<p>You can rest assured that at the end of this process we will release and make public documentation for how the funds we collect have been used and allocated.

<li>My name is Ashley Pierre.</li>
<li>I am a filmmaker, and this is my second short film.</li>
<li>The first one didn't go so well, but it was about 3 years ago, and I've learned a lot since then.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h2>Where Does My Money Go?</h2>
<p>The money will go towards purchasing equipment for the short film, such as new audio equipment, new cameras, and new lights. All of the equipment I will purchase (if we hit our goal), will be used to film this short sci fi, and many more films to come.</p>

My name is Ashley Pierre.
I am a filmmaker, and this is my second short film.
The first one didn't go so well, but it was about 3 years ago, and I've learned a lot since then.


Where Does My Money Go?
The money will go towards purchasing equipment for the short film, such as new audio equipment, new cameras, and new lights. All of the equipment I will purchase (if we hit our goal), will be used to film this short sci fi, and many more films to come.

<p>In 1958 a wonder drug was introduced into the UK, a drug that would cure morning sickness and anxiety in expectant mothers. Sadly, this drug Thalidomide would be the root of the world’s biggest man made disaster. It was not tested properly and rushed to market, before long it was revealed to cause devastating birth defects in unborn babies.<br/>An estimated 123,000 babies died at birth or shortly afterwards, those that did survive had stunted or missing limbs, and a range of symptoms that would prove common to victims of the drug.<br/>Some parents rejected the babies, some families split up from the pressure of raising them, many were sent into care homes out of society’s sight and conscience.</p>
<p>Sixty years on, the Thalidomide babies have become remarkable adults, with an impressive array of accolades and achievements, despite their obvious and immediate physical disadvantages.<br/><strong>Gary Skyner</strong> is a stand up comedian, actor, motivational speaker, pilot, paralegal and all round inspiration since he was the country’s second born Thalidomide baby. But despite being born with a severe and limiting deformity, in his own words Gary declares; “Well you can sit in your pyjamas all day and feel sorry for yourself or you can get on with it and live your life!’</p>
<p>Gary believes that the Thalidomide adults deserve some recognition and celebration to mark their remarkable and inspirational lives, so he is calling upon his extensive network of showbiz and sporting celebrities to get behind his night of entertainment and celebration. Gary wants to put on a show in a prestigious theatre, featuring A-list acts and personalities attending, to celebrate the Thalidomide babies and their extraordinary lives. It is to be a distinguished and honourable invitation-only event featuring a who’s who audience, and of course, the creators of the drug are invited.</p>
<p>We are raising money on IndieGoGo to produce the documentary of Gary’s quest. Featuring a host of well loved celebrities and partnered by the inimitable <strong>Ricky Tomlinson</strong>, the documentary ’60 Years On’ is to be made by a crack team of multi award winning film makers who will bring laughter and tears to a compelling and unforgettable story.  </p>
<p><strong>Who are We?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ricky Tomlinson</strong> - Executive Producer</p>
<p>National Treasure Ricky Tomlinson needs no introduction as one of the most loved actors in the country. Ricky has worked alongside  Hollywood royalty, been a leading figure of one of the best loved TV shows ever and won lifelong respect playing realistic, heartfelt characters with the iconic director Ken Loach. Ricky is a true living legend. With his comforting earthy persona and infectious enthusiasm, there is never a dull moment when Ricky is on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Hall </strong>- Producer</p>
<p>Karl Hall is a hugely respected Film and TV producer with an enviable career working with some of the most respected high profile programme makers in the UK. Recently Karl line produced the BAFTA winning film, ‘I am not a Witch’.</p>
<p><strong>Gary Cargill</strong> - Executive Producer</p>

Gary’s commitment to his roles is exemplary and evidenced in his appearances in mainstream TV and Film. Gary has worked with exceptional directors including Mike Leigh and David Yates.</p>
<p><strong>Steven Nesbit</strong> - Director</p>
<p>Steven is a multi award winning writer and director, whose material spans drama, comedy and advertising. Steven is proud to be part of the '60 Years On' Campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Why are We Using Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p>The story of the Thalidomide babies is delicate. Years of passing blame and wriggling out of responsibility has resulted in adding insult to injury for the victims, and although their fight to be recognised and compensated will continue, this is a story of achievement and inspiration. This is a celebration of human spirit, of determination, of hilarity in the face of adversity and as such cannot be coloured by the agendas of third parties. We must remain democratic in our voice and provide an unbiased film that presents the story, as it happens.</p>
<p>Without the commercial pressures of film making, we are free to allow the film to be seen by as many people as possible world wide, which is our mission.<br/>    </p>
<p>In a world that is intent on creating damning headlines to sensationalise, it is difficult to celebrate the great and come together as humans, but this is our intention. The Thalidomide survivors are truly amazing and transcend the base concerns of our modern world that is obsessed with image and equality, yet fails so many. The survivors have built careers and lives by adapting and being undeterred. The survivors shame us all for whingeing that we don’t like the colour of our hair or want to cover up our freckles! Only crowd funding can make this extraordinary event happen and only you, the sponsor, can empower Gary and Ricky to succeed.</p>

Why are We Using Indiegogo?
The story of the Thalidomide babies is delicate. Years of passing blame and wriggling out of responsibility has resulted in adding insult to injury for the victims, and although their fight to be recognised and compensated will continue, this is a story of achievement and inspiration. This is a celebration of human spirit, of determination, of hilarity in the face of adversity and as such cannot be coloured by the agendas of third parties. We must remain democratic in our voice and provide an unbiased film that presents the story, as it happens.
Without the commercial pressures of film making, we are free to allow the film to be seen by as many people as possible world wide, which is our mission.    
In a world that is intent on creating damning headlines to sensationalise, it is difficult to celebrate the great and come together as humans, but this is our intention. The Thalidomide survivors are truly amazing and transcend the base concerns of our modern world that is obsessed with image and equality, yet fails so many. The survivors have built careers and lives by adapting and being undeterred. The survivors shame us all for whingeing that we don’t like the colour of our hair or want to cover up our freckles! Only crowd funding can make this extraordinary event happen and only you, the sponsor, can empower Gary and Ricky to succeed.
Be part of something fantastic and get your Perk now!

<h2>Some Background, Some Introduction</h2>
<p>When I started writing <i>Ankou</i>, I wrote it because I don’t believe I have ever seen a good horror movie about Death or the Grim Reaper.  So I taxed myself with the challenge to write one and after nearly a year of writing and editing and redrafting, I know I have it.  When I collaborated with Elizabeth and her husband, T Scott Ross, on our award-winning short, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaROLExCM-U&amp;t=3s"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>The Re-Renaissance</i></a> (Audience Choice, Sparrow Film Project ‘14, New York, NY), I knew that they were the perfect duo to help be bring <i>Ankou</i> off the page and to life.</p>
<p>Also, the representation of women behind the camera in movies, though getting better, is still sparse, especially in the horror genre.  I couldn’t be more excited that Elizabeth is with us as our cinematographer and essentially my co-director.  Our production manager, Tiffany Gale, is also a woman starting her career in the movie industry.  I don’t want this to start sounding preachy or anything but this is a huge opportunity for all of us, Elizabeth and Tiffany and every woman in our cast and crew in particular.<br/> </p>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p><i>Ankou</i> tells the story of six friends who are celebrating the New Year and suddenly find themselves caught in Ankou’s sights.  Now, you make ask yourself, ‘Who’s Ankou?’ Well, Ankou is a centuries-old Briton-Celtic myth about a ghostly figure that wears a wide-brimmed hat that goes around collecting souls to ferry to the afterlife.  Some would say he’s the Grim Reaper of that region of the world.  But I think he’s more.</p>
<p>Unlike the Grim Reaper, who remains the same through all of time, Ankou is ever changing.  Ankou is said to take on the form of the last person in his village to die each year and that person must spend the next year collecting and carting souls to the afterlife if he has any hopes of moving on.</p>
<p>How much more interesting is that than a spirit with a skull-face wielding a scythe (don’t worry, there will still be a scythe in this movie)?  This is an incarnation of Death that has a purpose, just as a protagonist does in any movie. Thus, <i>Ankou</i> was born.</p>
<p>So this is our Get-Ankou-Off-The-Ground campaign.  We are running this campaign to cover every expense so we can move to filming.  That includes travel, housing, locations, costumes, insurance, rentals, salaries, catering, and all the other stuff that goes into making a movie that people, including myself up until about 7 months ago, don’t realize.</p>
<p>We will run another campaign while we are filming, based on the success of this campaign, to cover post-production costs but we won’t have any need for those without a film to take to post-production.  </p>
<p>You can make that happen for us.  So let’s scare some people and make a movie!</p>

<h2>How You Can Help</h2>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>We’ve taken the budget and looked at exactly what we’ll need to get this production started and the magic number we came up with was $44,750.  That breaks down like this:</span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528823204/l1v0id1wfclekdknbppg.png"" src=""""/></p> <p>In a nutshell, that is everything we will need to get ourselves ready for the production and start filming.  Anything extra that we raise will go towards ‘General Overhead’ for on-set purchases (props that break, duct tape, batteries, more duct tape, etc.).</p> <p>Now, this isn’t the entire budget.  Like we said above, we will be running another campaign based on the success of this campaign, to cover all our post-production costs, but this is the number that will Get-Ankou-Off-The-Ground.</p>
<h2><strong>Wait, What's a 'Big Actor Cost'?</strong></h2>
<p>We have been very fortunate to enter very serious contract talks and negotiations with the legendary horror actor, Michael Berryman, and his agent.  Mr. Berryman is known for films such as <i>The Hills Have Eyes</i>, <i>The Hills Have Eyes Part II<i>, The Devil's Rejects</i></i>, <i>Weird Science</i>, <i>The Lords of Salem</i>, as well as countless others as well as recurring spots on <i>Star Trek</i>.  Trust me, you know his face.  This is a number I have come up with that would cover (most of) his salary plus is travel, lodging, and any other riders he may have in order to be a part of this picture.</p>
<p>Having Mr. Berryman onboard for this project would be humungous.  It would be like Bill Gates endorsing a new app or Bruce Springsteen publicly endorsing a rising talent's debut CD.  He's an icon and legend in every sense of the word and having him onboard definitely does raise the budget a bit but the benefits of having someone of his expertise, experience, and presence vastly outweighs the rise in budget.  There's no doubt that he will give what is already a solid script and concept that extra X-factor.</p>

<h2>
<br/>So Why Should I Give You My Money?</h2> <p>Now, like with every Indiegogo campaign, we have some pretty exciting perks and rewards to reward your generosity.  Everything ranging from signed movie posters to in-person or online acting sessions, digital downloads, advanced viewings, and even visits to the set (if you’re local-ish).  We might even throw in an invite to join us at a film festival. However, every single donation, no matter the size, will get you listed in the credits because, at the end of the day, this movie will not have been able to be made without your donation and that deserves to be seen and recognized.</p>
<p>And we know times are tough for everyone and if you aren't able to donate right now, then we ask that you please share this campaign.  Every share is as impactful as a donation.  Even if you do donate, please share the campaign.  There can never be enough eyes on this campaign.  And, if you do donate, please leave us a comment.  We'd love to hear from you and what you thought of this presentation!</p>
<p>Simply put this is what Elizabeth, T Scott, all of our actors, our crew, and I have been working for.  This is what we want to do for a living (not create crowdfunding campaigns but create movies and stories and art).  We want to show people that it doesn’t matter what credits do or don’t come along with your name, what matters is if there’s a will.  Like the message in <i>Field of Dreams</i>, “If you build it, they will come.”  Well, that’s the plan.</p>
<p>And, just to reiterate, I could not be more excited that the majority of our crew, as it currently stands, is female and for that to be the case in this male-dominated industry and genre is all the more reason to get behind this project and make sure that this movie is made.  Everyone has a voice and everyone has the opportunity.<br/><br/>Making a movie is not easy.  Well, if you have a $50M budget, things might be a little easier, but those productions are still not without their own sets of challenges.  We do not have a $50M budget. We, as of now, do not have the reputation of a Wes Craven or John Carpenter or Stephen King or James Wan. When we yell ‘That’s a wrap’ on the final day of shooting in a way, our true challenge will just be beginning.  We will have a movie, now we’ll need to get people to see it. But at one point, all those people I just mentioned had the same worry. ‘Who will watch my movie once it’s done?’  That remains to be said but one this is for sure, they’re going to want to see; a quality product, a professional shoot, a solid story, an honest portrayal, and, most of all, they’re going to want to know that the time they spent watching <i>Ankou</i> was time well spent.  <br/><br/>With your donation to this project, we all can ensure that all of those ‘worries’ will be well taken care of. Like it’s been said; we have a very solid story, a top-notch crew waiting to be discovered, a cast eager to bring the words to life, and a confidence that you will thoroughly enjoy the time you spent watching <i>Ankou</i>.  Don’t believe us?  Donate and let us prove you wrong.  You do believe us?

Where Clara Banks, a high school senior, has an unusual hobby. Catfishing. It was all fun and games until she started receiving twisted messages at her school and her home. Now Clara fears for her life. Will she ever feel safe again, now that evil has come knocking?</p><h3>What We Need</h3><p>We are seeking $11,000.</p><h3>What Will It Be Used For</h3><p>$6,000 will be used for film production.  Funds will be put towards wardrobe, set design, make up, food for cast and crew, equipment, props, music, and others necessities needed to create a quality film.  Our talented crew is revved and ready to begin production this Fall. We are currently in pre-production and so far the storyboards have been completed, the script has been revised, set location scouting has begun, and casting is currently in progress. We have seen an enormous amount of talent so far and will update you on who we cast by mid-July. We will be sharing images from set throughout the film and keep you updated on the films progress. We want you to be with us every step of the way!</p><p>The other $5,000 will be donated to the local high school that we use as a set location. Out of that $5,000, $4,000 will be donated to the arts programs (split between band, choir, drama, and art)  because the arts are important. They are what drive the creativity of our youth.  It is that creativity that enables them to become the innovators of tomorrow. We have to continue to nourish it.</p><p>Speaking of nourish this is where the last $1,000 comes into play. That last $1,000 will go to the lunch program. You cannot properly create on an empty stomach. 16 million children go hungry a year in the U.S. That is 1 in 5 children. Sometimes their school lunch is their only opportunity for a balanced meal and no kid should go hungry. With proper nutrition a kid can thrive and have the fuel needed to succeed in their studies. With kids thriving it helps to shape a better generation of adults. If we go over our campaign amount, more funds would go towards the lunch program.</p><p>Additionally after post production is complete, a percentage of each film sale, will continue going into the lunch program. It only takes one act of kindness to cause a ripple effect and I would like our project to be a cause of a ripple. </p><h3>What You Get</h3><p>We have some great perks for you! Perks like finding your name in the film, film memorabilia, copy of the film, and obscure gifts (just to keep it interesting). We are sure the obscure will make ya smile. </p><p>You don't only get perks but you get to be a perk in the lives of the children from the school. And that is the greatest perk of all!</p><h3>Trials and Tribulations</h3><p>All films, no matter how long you plan will have hiccups, but you learn to adapt in order to create your vision. Not that much different than life. We learn and adapt. We are ready for what comes our way because we believe in what we are doing.

Where Clara Banks, a high school senior, has an unusual hobby. Catfishing. It was all fun and games until she started receiving twisted messages at her school and her home. Now Clara fears for her life. Will she ever feel safe again, now that evil has come knocking?What We NeedWe are seeking $11,000.What Will It Be Used For$6,000 will be used for film production.  Funds will be put towards wardrobe, set design, make up, food for cast and crew, equipment, props, music, and others necessities needed to create a quality film.  Our talented crew is revved and ready to begin production this Fall. We are currently in pre-production and so far the storyboards have been completed, the script has been revised, set location scouting has begun, and casting is currently in progress. We have seen an enormous amount of talent so far and will update you on who we cast by mid-July. We will be sharing images from set throughout the film and keep you updated on the films progress. We want you to be with us every step of the way!The other $5,000 will be donated to the local high school that we use as a set location. Out of that $5,000, $4,000 will be donated to the arts programs (split between band, choir, drama, and art)  because the arts are important. They are what drive the creativity of our youth.  It is that creativity that enables them to become the innovators of tomorrow. We have to continue to nourish it.Speaking of nourish this is where the last $1,000 comes into play. That last $1,000 will go to the lunch program. You cannot properly create on an empty stomach. 16 million children go hungry a year in the U.S. That is 1 in 5 children. Sometimes their school lunch is their only opportunity for a balanced meal and no kid should go hungry. With proper nutrition a kid can thrive and have the fuel needed to succeed in their studies. With kids thriving it helps to shape a better generation of adults. If we go over our campaign amount, more funds would go towards the lunch program.Additionally after post production is complete, a percentage of each film sale, will continue going into the lunch program. It only takes one act of kindness to cause a ripple effect and I would like our project to be a cause of a ripple. What You GetWe have some great perks for you! Perks like finding your name in the film, film memorabilia, copy of the film, and obscure gifts (just to keep it interesting). We are sure the obscure will make ya smile. You don't only get perks but you get to be a perk in the lives of the children from the school. And that is the greatest perk of all!Trials and TribulationsAll films, no matter how long you plan will have hiccups, but you learn to adapt in order to create your vision. Not that much different than life. We learn and adapt. We are ready for what comes our way because we believe in what we are doing. For every hiccup that tries to take you down, the perfect moments fuel the fire to see it through.With YOU!!We can bring a vision to life and make a difference. With one small step for a film and one giant act of kindness for a child's life.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>Is to produce a social impact documentary showcasing the Bronx community and literacy activists, educators, families, publishers, writers, librarians, bookstore owners, and city representatives collaborating toward a mutual goal of increasing literacy.</p>
<p>As of August 2018, The Bronx has a population of 1.5 million - 42 square miles and no independent bookstores. We will have our first independent bookstore in the South Bronx, this year.</p>
<p>We believe an increased emphasis on reading and consistently volunteering to encourage and aid those to read in Bronx communities is the start toward ending this literacy crisis.  We need to inform our current and new representatives that this is a topic of importance to us and  that stimulating legislative measures that provide access to affordable education opportunities are essential. These measures would act to curb economic discrimination, end segregated education, and ignite the process of lifting families out of poverty.</p>

<h2><strong>Why a documentary?</strong></h2>
<p>We believe one of the best ways to solve a major problem is to showcase both the problem and solution, visually. This systemic crisis, has been born out of years of neglect, ignorance, racism.</p>
<p>We will make sure this film is seen globally. It will be screened for national legislatures, city councils, and literacy organizations.  Our goal is to incite policy change and social change. We want to bolster the culture of reading in The Bronx.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532986797/wduqbj8y2brauwthyjnu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Illiteracy and poverty are often intertwined. Without the ability to read, your chances of securing employment, a home, and food, the life you want, dwindles. This is not to say that it is impossible! That would be a disservice to the countless people who have survived, and thrived against the odds. We do not seek to diminish those accomplishments. We seek to increase the support that Bronx residents receive, and believe that a literary culture could move us forward as community.</p>
<p>It begins with the desire to learn, but continues with the opportunity. Your contribution will help us to visually highlight the need of this opportunity for the people of The Bronx.</p>
<p>The positive impact we seek is an increased number of readers, books in the home to promote the importance of family literacy, students reading at and beyond their grade levels, widespread and affordable ESL programs, authors visiting Bronx institutions to see, read, and inspire people of color, and more literary arts, accessible college readiness programs , and increased GED programs.</p>

<h2><strong>The Team</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Gregory Hernandez </strong>is a Bronx native and resident.  He received a Bachelor’s degree in English from Binghamton University, where he concentrated on Creative Writing. His desire to tell stories visually has lead him to study screenwriting, photography, and cinema. Since 2014, he has produced and written over 13 works.</p>
<p>The decision to start a short documentary on the literacy challenge in The Bronx arose from searching for a bookstore to film in for a short film. Upon learning that borough’s sole bookstore was located 10 miles away from his home, Gregory set out to tell a compelling story about how The Bronx had reached this point, what/how Bronxites planned to do to solve this crisis, and how this crisis effects children who live in poverty. The Bronx currently has no bookstores, but one will open soon in the South Bronx, called ""The Lit Bar""</p>

<h3>Short Film Synopsis</h3>
<p>Murder in a modern Babylon follows the story of Miles Dalmas, a detective working to find a killer who murdered the girl he met the previous night. But when the police block his path and his urge to solve the case becomes too great, he must decide what he is willing to do in order to bring the killer to justice.</p>
<p>The themes of corruption and morality are the heart of the story. Can a person remain good in a world where it's moral arbiters are corrupt? And what is the price paid by those who try to remain good in a corrupt world?</p>
<p>This project is intended as a proof of concept for a larger story. This film will provide an introduction to the world and the characters that inhabit it. While also hopefully giving the audience enough to make them want to see more.</p>
<p>Inspired by both real world news stories about cover ups by british police and the italian giallo films of the 1970's, we aim to make a horror/ thriller that gets people talking. But we need your help.</p>

<p><strong>MEHAR </strong>follows the life of a professional wrestler from Singapore in the 1960s until 1990s. He was trained under the great wrestler from Hungary, King Kong and was part of the New World Alliance (NWA) group. Mehar Singh forged a name for himself, having wrestled Jimmy 'Snuka' Superfly, Abdullah the Butcher, partnered Uncle Elmer in a Tag Team match and refereed a historical match that took place in Gay World stadium, Singapore between the legendary Andre the Giant and King Curtis Iaukea in 1977.</p>
<p>Mehar had lived the kind of life that millions of wrestling fans would have dreamt off. He was in good company with wrestlers that later went on to be inducted in WWE Hall of Fame. He has seen it all and he speaks highly about his past achievements. As a small Singh, he makes up for his lack of size with his immense strength of courage. He was unwavering in the ring, collecting scars and fractured bones as memorabilia. </p>
<p>But that was in the past. Now, he lives his life quietly with his family, working part-time as a house detective for a local supermarket and goes around hardly noticed as the great Singapore wrestler he was in his heydays.</p>
<p>This documentary will explore the life of a wrestler living in 1960s Singapore, the atmosphere surrounding a wrestling match at the once famous Gay World stadium (famously dubbed as the Madison Square Garden of Asia), his life stories as a wrestler growing up in a conservative Hindu family, the peaks and troughs as a wrestler and how WWF changed the entire wrestling business.</p>
<p>Mehar has one wish he wishes to fulfil - to be remembered as a legend. This documentary aims to be the 'voice' for his wish and hopefully be remembered as a wrestling legend within the wrestling community.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We aim to raise <u><strong>USD 8000</strong></u> for this documentary and the bulk of the money goes to the production and post-production of this film - crew, location fee, talent fee (Mehar Singh) and editing fees. A small amount will also be used for film festivals fees and promo/marketing expenses.</p>
<h3>Breakdown of Budget</h3>
<p><strong>75%</strong> - Production + Post Production</p>
<p><strong>25% </strong>- Film Festivals, Marketing + Publicity Expenses</p>
<p><strong><i>What if we fail to raise the intended amount? </i></strong></p>
<p>Mehar, The Documentary will still move ahead. We will still be as passionate as we were when we started this project and will continuously work towards telling his story to the world - even if it takes a longer time to complete it!</p>
<h3>How your support will help us.</h3>

He was trained under the great wrestler from Hungary, King Kong and was part of the New World Alliance (NWA) group. Mehar Singh forged a name for himself, having wrestled Jimmy 'Snuka' Superfly, Abdullah the Butcher, partnered Uncle Elmer in a Tag Team match and refereed a historical match that took place in Gay World stadium, Singapore between the legendary Andre the Giant and King Curtis Iaukea in 1977.
Mehar had lived the kind of life that millions of wrestling fans would have dreamt off. He was in good company with wrestlers that later went on to be inducted in WWE Hall of Fame. He has seen it all and he speaks highly about his past achievements. As a small Singh, he makes up for his lack of size with his immense strength of courage. He was unwavering in the ring, collecting scars and fractured bones as memorabilia. 
But that was in the past. Now, he lives his life quietly with his family, working part-time as a house detective for a local supermarket and goes around hardly noticed as the great Singapore wrestler he was in his heydays.
This documentary will explore the life of a wrestler living in 1960s Singapore, the atmosphere surrounding a wrestling match at the once famous Gay World stadium (famously dubbed as the Madison Square Garden of Asia), his life stories as a wrestler growing up in a conservative Hindu family, the peaks and troughs as a wrestler and how WWF changed the entire wrestling business.
Mehar has one wish he wishes to fulfil - to be remembered as a legend. This documentary aims to be the 'voice' for his wish and hopefully be remembered as a wrestling legend within the wrestling community.

What We Need
We aim to raise USD 8000 for this documentary and the bulk of the money goes to the production and post-production of this film - crew, location fee, talent fee (Mehar Singh) and editing fees. A small amount will also be used for film festivals fees and promo/marketing expenses.
Breakdown of Budget
75% - Production + Post Production
25% - Film Festivals, Marketing + Publicity Expenses
What if we fail to raise the intended amount? 
Mehar, The Documentary will still move ahead. We will still be as passionate as we were when we started this project and will continuously work towards telling his story to the world - even if it takes a longer time to complete it!
How your support will help us.

<h3>Hi there!</h3>
<p>I'm <strong>Isabel Canzoneri</strong> and I'm from Brazil. I've been living in the US since 2007 when I got married. I have a degree in Marketing and it was quite hard for me when I started to look for jobs here and couldn't get anything in the area that I used to work in my home country and that really frustrated me.</p>
<p>In my frustration I forgot what I really think about life. Everything happens for a reason and everything is always well.</p>
<p>This campaign is very important to me because I think it is important to be compensated for our efforts and work. Actors tend to do a lot of work for free because they love the craft so much and want to be in as many project that they possibly can and it's okay.</p>
<p>However, I understand that besides precious time, actors spend some money too in the process. They pay for gas to get to the set, they buy some snacks, they print the script and call sheet... they spend money so I really think it's important for us filmmakers to compensate them, even if it is only for the gas. It is really appreciated by them and they will want to work again with the people who treated them with the respect they deserve. After all, we are a team so helping each other out goes without saying.</p>
<p>Besides paying cast and crew, filmmakers must feed them while they are on set. It's usually a long day when we are on set and as the day goes by, so do our energy. Can you imagine how a film would look like if the actors were hungry? You know, when you get hungry, you get cranky!</p>
<p>To bring a film to the screen for the enjoyment of an audience, money is necessary and we need a little help and of course that will be more than appreciated.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What You Give and What You Get!</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need $7500! That will cover all the expenses.</li>
<li>With your help, we will be so happy we will be giving shout out to you on social media if that's important to you. We think it's pretty cool! You could also be an Associate Producer! Now, how awesome is that? Seeing your name on the credits on IMDB! Even a thank on IMDB would be super satisfying and we will be happy to add your name to our credits there! Hooray!!!</li>
<li>The money will go to paying cast (3) and crew (that one is a minimum, you wouldn't believe this), composers (we have two), editor, DP...</li>
<li>Besides paying for cast and crew, then there's food, drinks (no alcohol, I promise that!), snacks, more drinks (it's been so hot lately!), napkins, toilet paper, sun screen (it's been really hot guys!).</li>
<li>And then there are expenses such as gas for location scout, drive to and from set a couple of times, batteries for camera, tapes, markers, ink for printer, paper to print release forms, talent release, script, call sheet, folder (you gotta be organized), submission fees and other expenses I can't remember now and I'll find the invoices later!

<p>Almost two decades ago, I was hired to be a one-on-one aide to a student with cerebral palsy. His name is Mike Berkson.

Well, in 2005 I decided to run from Orlando, FL to Chicago, IL (where we are from) to increase awareness for how Mike lives, increase awareness around cerebral palsy, and to show people what is possible, because I wasn’t a runner before the Orlando event. That 1,200 mile run put our story on the map and that was the domino that fell and made everything you are reading possible.</p> <p>In 2016, I made that run a second time (at the age of 42!). People would ask me why I would do that run again. I say to them, as I will say to you, because my work isn’t finished, is yours? Our story has a way of bringing out the best in people.

<h3>Movie Synopsis</h3>
<p>In New York, December 1822, Dr. Clement Moore, a professor of world literature, is inspired to pen a holiday poem for his young children. Influenced by the folklore of Old World culture, Moore crafts his whimsical piece into a magical tale about a kind and generous gift-bearer that secretly visits homes on Christmas Eve, delivering joy to children around the world.</p>
<p>It is while musing about this seemingly mythical character that Moore first learns of the ancient story of a gift-giver from the Greco-Roman Era; one that he comes to believe may be the origin of similar fables throughout the world. What he finds is a tale that ironically would be lost to the lore he was about to immortalize. He soon uncovers the surprising story of a mighty empire at a crossroads in history and of an orphan boy from Asia Minor, whose own journey to find his destiny would one day lead him to the city of Myra.</p>
<p>Moore had discovered the lost legend of Nicholas, a selfless child that became an heroic man of faith, a devout bishop by day and a secret gift-giver by night; a man whom in the face of terrible greed and persecution would prove that not every hero swings a sword. It was the story of Christmas origins, the story of selflessness and sacrifice, yet ultimately it's about the power of storytelling and the hope it can bring. It is the now forgotten tale of the beloved saint named Nicholas...Nicholas of Myra.</p>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>It is in troubled times that it becomes most important for art to reflect the goodness in the world. With the lack of inspiring family entertainment that Hollywood and independent cinema offer today, there is no better time to tell the story of Nicholas of Myra -- one that does not undo the cherished myth, but reinforces the hope and kindness it kindled within many of us as children. The story leaves no doubt that ole' St. Nick is for real and that he is a sacred part of holiday tradition. He is for people of all ages and not just those who celebrate Christmas. The origins of many age-old traditions are woven together like never before in this dramatic and layered tale that, until now, has been supplanted by folklore for nearly two hundred years.</p>

<p><strong><i>Young Nicholas and his friend Theo try to stay hidden during a game of hide and seek</i></strong></p>
<p>In December of 2001, ""NICHOLAS OF MYRA"" Writer and Director Gerald Hartke, was first inspired to begin writing an historical dramatization that would become the basis for an epic film. After years of research and writing had passed and the final treatment of the story was complete, Gerald became enamored with the idea of a period motion-picture about the untold origin of the age-old legend of Saint Nicholas of Myra. Although he believed the audience for the story already existed, it was a movie that Hollywood clearly had no interest in making. Having developed the project for several more years, Hartke decided to take ambitious and innovative steps to bring the story to the screen for audiences to enjoy. It was then that the idea caught the attention of a group of private, non-industry investors and the film was green-lit as an independent production.</p>

<p><strong><i>Young Nicholas' father comforts him after a dramatic revelation</i></strong></p>
<p>In partnership with several individual supporters, Gerald began raising capital and established an independent movie studio to house the production. His aim was to create a film that would pay homage to the classic Christmas movies he grew up on, while providing the audience a new potential classic to enjoy year after year. After assembling a talented team of actors and filmmakers, as well as the cinema production technology a project of this scope required, he has since worked with more than one hundred performers, dozens of crew members and many period sets and locations. Hartke and his creative team also constructed a full-sized replica of a Greco-Roman sailing ship that was required for some major sequences in the film. With extensive sets, costumes, props and models that span two separate historical periods, the sizable production remains headquartered at a studio-soundstage in a suburb of Buffalo, New York. Fueled entirely by private contributions, the goal now is to complete what may be considered the most ambitious independent film production ever attempted.</p>

</div></div>","Movie Synopsis
In New York, December 1822, Dr. Clement Moore, a professor of world literature, is inspired to pen a holiday poem for his young children. Influenced by the folklore of Old World culture, Moore crafts his whimsical piece into a magical tale about a kind and generous gift-bearer that secretly visits homes on Christmas Eve, delivering joy to children around the world.
It is while musing about this seemingly mythical character that Moore first learns of the ancient story of a gift-giver from the Greco-Roman Era; one that he comes to believe may be the origin of similar fables throughout the world. What he finds is a tale that ironically would be lost to the lore he was about to immortalize. He soon uncovers the surprising story of a mighty empire at a crossroads in history and of an orphan boy from Asia Minor, whose own journey to find his destiny would one day lead him to the city of Myra.
Moore had discovered the lost legend of Nicholas, a selfless child that became an heroic man of faith, a devout bishop by day and a secret gift-giver by night; a man whom in the face of terrible greed and persecution would prove that not every hero swings a sword. It was the story of Christmas origins, the story of selflessness and sacrifice, yet ultimately it's about the power of storytelling and the hope it can bring. It is the now forgotten tale of the beloved saint named Nicholas...Nicholas of Myra.

<h3><strong>Fortunately enough, we've already shot and edited the film but now we need your help to complete it!</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>ABOUT ME: </strong>I'm an independent Brampton based filmmaker and graduate from both York University and Sheridan College's film programs, although the majority of my career has been spent working in television and graphic design. Having a love of cinema that's been building for years, I felt the need to take the next step and start writing and directing stories that are personal to me.    <strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS: </strong>Following the civil war and the intense bombing campaign in the eastern region of Ghouta, Syria, Sana (37) and her only son, Anouar (20) attempt to repair what remains of their damaged relationship in what may be her last phone call and conversation with her son. He’s trapped in a basement shelter fearing for his life in the bombed out region, and she’s on the other side of the world in Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p><strong>RUNTIME: 11 min</strong></p>
<p><strong>DIRECTOR/WRITER/EDITOR/DP: Samuel Dayomi</strong></p>
<p><strong>CAST: Christina Tannous (SAVING HOPE &amp; DESIGNATED SURVIVOR), Ehren Kassam (DEGRASSI: NEXT CLASS &amp; THE STRAIN)</strong></p>

<p><i>Uncorrected super 16 film stills.</i></p>
<p><strong>VISION: </strong>After following the ongoing Syrian civil war, the refugee crisis it brought, and its drastic turning point in the Ghouta region, I felt the need to do more than just donate money to organizations attempting to help those whose lives had been thrown into chaos. Since films and art, in general, have a way of personalizing and providing an empathetic introspective, maybe more so than any dispassionate news broadcast, I felt that this would be my way of contributing to the greater good.  </p>
<p>Little to say, this is a bit of a passion project for me that was shot with a tiny production crew of 2 people (myself being the other) along with my 2 talented ACTRA cast members and the generous support of the CMPA (Canadian Media Producers Association) and LIFT (Liasion of Independent Filmmakers of Toronto). A lot of work has gone into making the most out of this emotionally ambitious ""bottle film,"" centering the majority of it on creating compelling and believable performances to help ground it in the real world.  </p>

<h3>Why On Super 16 Film?</h3>
<p>Well, I'm glad you asked. It's because I love to put myself through pain and also because Christopher Nolan said so... All terrible joking aside, super 16 like it's larger and smaller gauges provide a unique look and feel that make it stand out from digital formats. It's all about how it renders colours and the grit it provides in an image as can be seen above.</p>
<p>It's certainly not the first time I've shot on film, having done so in at least two other projects. I can say it's become an important and somewhat inseparable part of how I work. </p>

ABOUT ME: I'm an independent Brampton based filmmaker and graduate from both York University and Sheridan College's film programs, although the majority of my career has been spent working in television and graphic design. Having a love of cinema that's been building for years, I felt the need to take the next step and start writing and directing stories that are personal to me.     
SYNOPSIS: Following the civil war and the intense bombing campaign in the eastern region of Ghouta, Syria, Sana (37) and her only son, Anouar (20) attempt to repair what remains of their damaged relationship in what may be her last phone call and conversation with her son. He’s trapped in a basement shelter fearing for his life in the bombed out region, and she’s on the other side of the world in Toronto, Canada.
RUNTIME: 11 min
DIRECTOR/WRITER/EDITOR/DP: Samuel Dayomi
CAST: Christina Tannous (SAVING HOPE & DESIGNATED SURVIVOR), Ehren Kassam (DEGRASSI: NEXT CLASS & THE STRAIN)
 

Uncorrected super 16 film stills.
VISION: After following the ongoing Syrian civil war, the refugee crisis it brought, and its drastic turning point in the Ghouta region, I felt the need to do more than just donate money to organizations attempting to help those whose lives had been thrown into chaos. Since films and art, in general, have a way of personalizing and providing an empathetic introspective, maybe more so than any dispassionate news broadcast, I felt that this would be my way of contributing to the greater good.  
Little to say, this is a bit of a passion project for me that was shot with a tiny production crew of 2 people (myself being the other) along with my 2 talented ACTRA cast members and the generous support of the CMPA (Canadian Media Producers Association) and LIFT (Liasion of Independent Filmmakers of Toronto). A lot of work has gone into making the most out of this emotionally ambitious ""bottle film,"" centering the majority of it on creating compelling and believable performances to help ground it in the real world.

I want to make this film the best it can possibly be. I've put every dollar I have, and then some I don't have into this project, paid entirely out of pocket. But costs tend to run high when you're shooting on film and are still relatively new to filmmaking.

The crew at Sugarbabies can't wait to work on a new concoction that they have no doubts will surpass the achievements of their debuts!

THE STORY
The idea of finding a sugar daddy to solve all money struggles is a very topical issue among young women, so it seemed like the perfect time to write a short comedy about it. Sugarbabies brings to life a story that many women in their 20s are already telling each other.
Wrapped in an aesthetic package of pastel blue, pink and yellow hues reminiscent of Wes Anderson and unveiled through comic-book, over-exaggerated style cinematography full of visual gags and fast edits, Sugarbabies will be a fast-paced, energetic display of comedic chaos.
Underneath the comedy, Sugarbabies sheds light on the anxieties of many millennials such as growing debt and ever rising housing prices and the fact that the ‘sugar baby’ business is a sobering reality for some young women.
THE CAST AND THE CHARACTERS

MEET GIGI
Gigi is a loud and charismatic millennial with a deep love for all things extra. Stubborn, wild and ambitious Gigi is a true fan of the sugar baby aesthetic and all things luxury. Like a magpie she likes bright and shiny things and will attack obnoxious boys on bicycles.
Gigi will be portrayed by Olivia Nardini who has already appeared in multiple projects such as the Matchbox/ABC TV series The Heights and short films His Father's Son (2016) and Backstabbers (2018)

MEET CARLA

Having worked with most of the Sugarbabies crew members on past projects Jeremy is tremendously excited to be working with the crew again, believing the crew dynamic to be unparalleled.Jeremy studied film and television at Curtin University and is currently working in the field as a freelance videographer which has allowed him to gain an excellent technical understanding and experience of audio and sound as well as rich experience. Jeremy is one of the more amusing people to provide on set catering for as he's full of interesting quirks like the rule that he will not eat anything sweet without a glass of fresh milk.

KATHERINE CAREY
EDITOR
Katherine is a Canadian born editor raised in Perth. She graduated from Curtin University in 2018 with a Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Commerce where she developed a speciality in editing and continuity. Katherine has previously worked on a number of projects including short films, documentary, music videos and television pieces as well as a period of work experience with the editing team at Channel 9 News. Katherine collaborated with Michelle on the documentary Blazers (2017) as editor and cinematographer. Katherine is currently working as an editor on a number of short films including a promotional piece on a new unit within the Bachelor of Arts in collaboration with The University of Western Australia. Whilst juggling all her projects Katherine keeps healthy by making sure to eat a banana a day.

WHY CROWDFUNDING?
With the crew being so passionate about Sugarbabies we hope to create a film that you will enjoy but to do so we need your support for us to be able to create a high quality project.
WHERE WILL THE MONEY GO?
With all of our cast and crew volunteering their time towards this project for free, all funds raised will be going towards production costs. These are expenses such as:
Costuming and Production Design: Josh’s dreams of creating the inside of a fluffy pink birthday cake won’t happen without your help!
Equipment Hire: Not gonna lie, a camera for Steph and Alex to play with would be nice…
Catering: Our producer is a bad cook a the best of times (too much video footage exists to prove this), without your support the crew will have to suffer even more than usual.
Location: Gigi needs a home!
Festivals: Please help Sugarbabies travel the world! We want to share the story with as many of you as possible.
PERKS
We have some delicious perks available including copies of Sugarbabies itself, merchandise, scripts and even invitations to the VIP screening event later this year!
THE IMPACT OF YOUR SUPPORT
For an emerging filmmaker, there is nothing more exhilarating than seeing the story you have dedicated day and night towards come together and light up the big screen and travel the globe.
RISKS AND CHALLENGES
Being independent filmmakers means you are always pushing your limits. With the cast and crew all willing to donate time, resources and funds to make this film happen, we hope to use our experience on past projects to break new ground with Sugarbabies.
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
If you want to contribute but aren’t able, it would be just as amazing to share this campaign or our film social media pages with your friends and family!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>PhoenixWorksFilms, with Victor De Almeida at the helm have produced three short films as of 2019 and have two more in the pipeline, with 'The Chair' being one of them. Starting in 2016, the team and their projects have been accepted in festivals such as Independent Days Interntional Filmfest in Karlsruhe, the Short Film Show, Los Angeles Cinefest, Lisbon Rendezvous Film Festival, amongst others. </p>
<p>In the past three years the team have worked with various talented cast and crew, Roberta Bononi, editor of their first short film, Cain, went onto work for Netflix, whilst Korsshan Sclauer, cinematographer on 'The Bear' and 'I'll Always Love Tuesdays' has worked on a number of mainstream music videos by artists such as Royksopp, Miles from Kinshasa and Bexey. </p>
<p>This campaign and its success is vital for us if we are to continue to make powerful, thought provoking short films. Up until this point we have been entirely self-funded, and whilst we are passionate enough to continue to do this, ultimately, the help of those who enjoy seeing creatives succeed is appreciated and needed. </p>At PhoenixWorksFilms, we do not choose or projects lightly, we attempt to hand pick special concepts which we think will leave a lasting impression. Your contribution will help us continue to be able to curate, high production value projects. <p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise £1,200 which will go towards part of the budget, this will help us pay for the location and keep the cast and crew fed! Anything over the required budget will help us pay the cast and crew for their dedication which we think will be an added bonus for all their efforts.</p>

<p>Anything that is donated to the project will make a massive difference and will mean that we do not have to worry about cutting costs and simply focus on making the best film possible. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>*cough* and discuss the risks and challenges that we may face *cough*</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We hope that you join us on this journey and help us make something we are truly proud of.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Captive</i> is a comedy-horror short film that follows the story of Dave, a man soon to be married who is captured and held prisoner by a suspected cannibal murderer - only to realise, after a bloody escape, that it was a stag do prank staged by his mates to prepare him for the weekend ahead! It's an ambitious piece that hopes to really use strong aesthetics and performances, along with the crucial support in the post-production stages, to draw audiences into a world of horror long enough to catch them out with the film's comedic punchline!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our crowdfunding campaign is aiming to raise at least £1000 to bring<i> Captive</i> to life. Despite £1000 possibly seeming like a lot of money to create a short film, the unfortunate reality is that film props, costumes, equipment, travel expenses and catering can all mount up to hefty sums of money... never mind the cost for submitting the finished product into film festivals around the world!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our team consists of young but experienced filmmakers who are always striving to hone their craft and develop themselves as creative storytellers. With <i>Captive </i>being a project where mise en scène is crucial, we can't afford to scrimp on props and costumes within the story. It is also crucial for us to be able to feed our hardworking cast and crew, along helping them afford transport to and from the set as they are working on this project with NO WAGE - simply because they're invested in the project.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">If we fail to make our target, our film festival run and expenses will suffer - however, if we SURPASS our target then we have no excuse but to make a fantastic short film!</p>

During my casting I had people who broke down as they simply auditioned for the radio voice. This fear is present and real, and I want nothing more and nothing less than to simply portray that. ---Cast & Crew Ally by Allie Costa - https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2812175/?ref_=nv_sr_1Jennifer by Sarah Sypniewski - https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10003517/?ref_=fn_a...Stacy by Heidi Kurzejka - https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6239349/?ref_=nv_sr_1 Radio by Paul Carpenter - https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6208783/?ref_=fn_al...  Director/Producer/Writer: Katrine Dolmer1st Assistant Director: Theresa EschbacherDirector of Photography: Sathish ShankuttyThe rest of the Crew List can be provided upon request.  Why Donate?Films are expensive, especially when one is a student in Los Angeles. As a producer student I am highly addicted to making detailed budgets and schedules, and I'm happy to find that I can keep my budget under $2000! Unfortunately I can only find little of this amongst my non existing savings, and this is where I need your help.I hope to find people who love film or love supporting creators, to be part of this journey.

Our total budget for this project is £4,450.
 
Your Perks
We want to thank you for helping our project by giving something back! We'd like to share some of the more personal aspects of our film with you such as one of a kind concept art, our expertly made props from the film, and behind the scenes photos!
And for our fellow filmmakers out there, we'd love to cater a perk just for you: to say thank you for showing us your support, we want to show you ours! We want you to send us anything from your work - a poster or a prop, for example - that can be used within our set; its nice to be nice! Look for the perk titled 'Lights, Camera, EGG-TION'.
 
Risks & Challenges
Our biggest challenge lies with our very talented ladies in the Production Design team. They have a lot to do in such a short amount of time, such as building the eggs in extreme detail, building a set and so on. This, and travel costs, are the biggest strain on our budget.
This where our campaign comes in! We're asking for your help in order to overcome these risks and challenges.

 
The Impact
Your love and support for our project will have a massive impact on the production value and what we can achieve! We desperately want to make the best of our final year at university, and are keen to create a film we're wholeheartedly proud of. This final project is what we venture out into the world with, and hopefully, will help with employment post graduation
For many of us, this will be our first festival submission. We hope we can translate how special and unique this film is onto the big screen.

 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you feel as strongly as we do about this project, but can't help us financially, don't worry! You can help us in other ways by showing your support via our social media pages, and at our local events:

<p>My name is <a href=""https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm8419872/filmography"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>Vanessa Palmer</strong></i></a> and I am the creator of Prana Warriors -  a mindful and philanthropic travel, documentary series that takes you on a journey of self-discovery, while raising awareness and support for underprivileged communities around the world . </p>
<p>I have been passionate about traveling the world, immersing myself in new cultures, the mindful movement, and bridging the gap in philanthropy for as long as I can remember. Alongside my near 20 year career as an artistic entrepreneur and creative film producer, being a mom, mindfulness author and yoga and meditation teacher, I had a really deep calling to make an inspirational documentary series about finding your true spirit and happiness and creating a new way of giving back through experiential philanthropy globally.</p>
<p>Being immersed in finding creative ways to raise money and then actually going in on the ground and getting involved with the community you are helping, is nothing short of life changing. For me, telling a story through film is such a powerful medium and I truly listened to the pulling of my heart strings to create this and share this inspirational movement with the world in a very unique way.</p>
<p>My team and Executive Producers, <a href=""https://www.imdb.com/name/nm8298586/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>James Langer</strong></i></a> and <i><strong>Taz Rashid,</strong></i> and the countless other amazing people that have been on this project, have been working extremely hard over the past 3 years to finance, film, edit and get this documentary, movement and inspiration out into the world.  We are so close to finishing it and it will be ready for release in March 2019!</p>

There will be plenty of <strong><i>calls to action</i></strong> where people can go to Ciudad De Angeles and directly donate to help us pay it forward. We hope our documentary will continue to raise close to $100,000 more for their projects and expansion to change the lives of these kids in need.</p>

<h3>The Coffee Experience </h3>
<p> My name is Grant Garry, and boy do I love coffee! If there was a way to get a government issued license that said I was married to coffee, I probably would! Coffee brings everything and everyone together. A coffee <b>EXPERIENCE</b> is the environment, energy, human interaction, and much more. It is so sensory oriented that it's what the cool kids would call 4-D! Have you ever stopped and thought to yourself ""Heck, I am doing more than just drinking a cup of coffee."" That is the central theme of ""Room for Cream."" I will be exploring the experience(s) you can have while drinking specialty coffee.</p>
<ul>
<li>What goes into creating the coffee experience?</li>
<li>Can we create a better world if we are present and savor a moment? </li>
<li>Did you know that we are basically experiencing coffee today the way people did in the early 1800's? </li>
<li>What psychological aspects are behind behind it? </li>
<li>What other themes are associated with drinking coffee?</li>
<li>Most importantly, why? WHY DO WE LOVE COFFEE SO FREAKING MUCH!?!?!?!</li>
</ul>
<p>For the past three months, I have been doing research with Chuck Jones of Jones Coffee Roasters in Pasadena. I believe Chuck Jones knows exactly what is needed to create the perfect coffee experience. I have attended coffee cuppings (very fun), spent time in the roasting room, sat in on client meetings, and learned about the overall specialty coffee experience. I plan to explore this ""experience"" and showcase the vertical integration of Chuck's company. The Jones family has a coffee farm in Guatemala, which I believe makes for even more fascinating storytelling. </p>
</div><div>
<h2>How the funds will be used </h2>
<p>Funds raised will be used to send my camera crew to the family's coffee farm in Guatemala. The production relies heavily on your support as a way to create jobs, hire professional crew members, rent camera equipment, and complete the overall vision of the project. Together my crew and I plan to film at specialty coffee shops, interview roasters, shop owners, and psychology experts.  </p>
<p>Additional costs will include but are not limited to editing, sound mixing, color correction, and festival submissions.</p>
<p>My last film, Black Cat, was featured in over 60 film festivals worldwide, won 6 best feature awards, and is now streaming on iTunes. I am confident that I have the skills to create another successful film and tell an amazing story. </p>
<p>Want to grab coffee with me? Want some quality beans of your own? Join us on set? Check out the perks! </p>

<p>If you are not able to donate, I welcome you to share via email, social media platforms, or word of mouth with lovers of coffee or lovers of life!!!</p>
<p>And that's it! Let's get some coffee! </p>

For the past three months, I have been doing research with Chuck Jones of Jones Coffee Roasters in Pasadena. I believe Chuck Jones knows exactly what is needed to create the perfect coffee experience. I have attended coffee cuppings (very fun), spent time in the roasting room, sat in on client meetings, and learned about the overall specialty coffee experience. I plan to explore this ""experience"" and showcase the vertical integration of Chuck's company. The Jones family has a coffee farm in Guatemala, which I believe makes for even more fascinating storytelling. 

How the funds will be used 
Funds raised will be used to send my camera crew to the family's coffee farm in Guatemala. The production relies heavily on your support as a way to create jobs, hire professional crew members, rent camera equipment, and complete the overall vision of the project. Together my crew and I plan to film at specialty coffee shops, interview roasters, shop owners, and psychology experts.  
Additional costs will include but are not limited to editing, sound mixing, color correction, and festival submissions.
My last film, Black Cat, was featured in over 60 film festivals worldwide, won 6 best feature awards, and is now streaming on iTunes. I am confident that I have the skills to create another successful film and tell an amazing story. 
Want to grab coffee with me? Want some quality beans of your own? Join us on set? Check out the perks! 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you are not able to donate, I welcome you to share via email, social media platforms, or word of mouth with lovers of coffee or lovers of life!!!
And that's it! Let's get some coffee!

<p>From the Director:<br/>This story started with the intention of exploring the idea of what justice would look like if we only thought in terms of right and wrong - free from the influence of politics, clout, discrimination, etc. I found myself wanting to tell a story centered on a character with a strong IQ and EQ, which led to creating a young ADA bound by the logic of law to contrast against a professional superior she's compelled to prosecute for personal reasons. <br/><br/>The dual vision of strong female characters and a rock-solid ensemble appealed to me from the very beginning. I also wanted to explore how different people involved in one case navigate through what their own definition of ""right"" is. <br/><br/>Speaking on behalf of the creative team, it is our hope that this film will encourage those who have directly or indirectly been made to feel that their stories and their feelings are ignored. We believe any victim of any kind of abuse is worthy of justice, validation, and closure, and we salute them and the people fighting for them. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We're Ella and Nick and we'd love for you to help us make our short!</p>
<p>In this near futuristic drama, we explore how technology has made it both easier and also more difficult for people to connect.</p>
<p>Jade is in that awkward on again/ off again relationship stage. Disappointed by the lack of closeness with her “ex-girlfriend,” she decides to sign up for FRNDLNK, an online friend service that allows people to interact with professional friends in a virtual reality. She is matched with a very highly rated FRNDLNK friend, Charlie.</p>
<p>Charlie takes Jade on a series of “ virtual excursions” where they begin to initiate a friendship. From exploring abandoned water parks to breaking and entering into lavish mansions to bonding over shared experiences as queer people, they do it all. With each experience, Jade feels a growing connection to Charlie.</p>
<p>But can a relationship be maintained solely through virtual interaction?</p>
<p>As two highly motivated and sensitive queer people, we hope that our common goal of bringing forth stories with complex and fully realized LGBTQ characters to the screen inspires you to want to help us make that happen.</p>
<p>The LGBTQ community is an underrepresented and marginalized class in many parts of the world so it's important that we start to see representation for queer characters that isn’t only defined by who they love so that we may better see them in all facets of life as equals. We all have a lot more in common than we like to think or care to know and that understanding can lead to helping us end divisiveness.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our budget is roughly $5 k. We'll be investing our own money and are hoping to raise enough to meet our goal.</p>
<p>We'll be using all the money, whether we reach the goal or not, to pay for all of our equipment (including the camera and lights), the sound, the props, hair &amp; make up, our actors, locations, post production and food!</p>
<p>There are some small and big perks as gifts for helping us out!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We really feel this film will bring something meaningful to the world that audiences will resonate with on a personal level.</p>
<p>For the LGBTQ community, it is a rare occurrence that their lives on film aren't reduced to their sexual preferences. We have a responsibility to share the beauty of being a queer person and to use our voices to uplift those like us who often feel underrepresented in media.</p>
<p>After working on countless productions and creating our own work to great success in the past, we're confident that with your help we can create something truly magnificent!</p>

<p>Sabüi Studios started as a very small organization. Technically speaking, one-person small. So I might as well talk in the first person...</p>
<p>Sabüi is named in dedication to a close friend, band leader, and teacher, Ousmane Camara, a Guinea-born Griot, master-balafonist, and Vermont resident since 2014. I started playing drums in Ousmane's band, Sabouyouma in 2016 (along with Assane Coly). My experience in Sabouyouma with Assane and Ousmane– and their experience in West-African Griot culture– inspired me to want to share their stories. ""Sabüi"" translates roughly to ""Someone you're eternally grateful to"" in the Guinea language Susu (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBG5wlUYIn8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBG5wlUYIn8</a>). Sabüi has co-produced and released three studio singles for Sabouyouma in 2018 with a full-length album due in 2019 (<a href=""https://open.spotify.com/artist/14h4VYxpbC6JDfU9OGduNi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://open.spotify.com/artist/14h4VYxpbC6JDfU...</a>).</p>
<p>My first official release was shot in Matanzas, Cuba with members of ""Los Muñequitos de Matanzas"". With 1 camera, 1 lens, and a zoom h4 plus a few mics, I tracked and produced ""De Cuba Soy"": <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSf6BaQejXQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSf6BaQejXQ</a></p>
<p>In 2017, I returned to Cuba and recorded ""Para Que Un Dia Vuelvas"" (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKLmxB6npfc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKLmxB6npfc</a>), this time adding an additional camera to my rig and bringing on my good friend: Dubai-based drummer, and incredible audio engineer Ratish Chadha. While living in the U.S., Ratish toured with Toubab Krewe as their audio-engineer and was freelance musician in New Orleans (where we originally met).</p>
<p>In 2018 I made my second trip to Senegal, this time accompanied by Assane and Ratish. It was our most ambitious project, shooting with three cameras, and recording 5 bands and over 25 musicians total over two weeks.</p>
<p>This is a dream ""job"" for us– having the privilege to help share the stories of the torch-bearers of West-African percussion– the music which is the rhythmic-grandmother of all things blues, jazz, funk, R&amp;B, soul, and ""American Music"" as we know it: but it's been a enormous investment of time and money.</p>

<p>Be able to logistically afford to finish this project. Part of ""finishing"" this project for now means that it ripples and echos well into the future. Being able to create a compelling audio experience from the video recordings, and turning that into an album (who's proceeds will go 100% direct to the artists) that could create passive future revenue for these artists is a very important part of that.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in Vietnam. Then I moved to Florida from July 2018 after four years of living in Japan to pursue my passion for filming. Currently, I am in the Film Production MFA program at Full Sail University.</p>
<p>Everybody says that I'm lucky to know what I want to do in life and that I am lucky enough to even get the opportunity to be here, in the US, to follow my dream. Yes, I am a lucky girl. But it took me quite a while to have enough courage to overcome all my self-doubt, insecurities and fears, to get out of my comfort zone and start my journey with filming. And trust me when I say this: that journey has never been easy. Now, as I am surrounded by the creative world that I yearn to be in my whole life, I struggle from internal conflict every day. As a young artist, I usually find myself in a dilemma - being true to my own artistic view or following what people like. Because you cannot just make art for self-enjoyment, but at the same time you also want to be recognized as who you truly are. There is no right or wrong in the art world because everything is subjective. Everything sounds so simple but when it comes to reputation and recognition, it is really hard to make the right decision.  I realize that learning to be true to who you are while being open to criticism is the key to survive and develop as an artist.</p>
<p>The idea of The Masterpiece hit me when I was struggling with the screen writing workshops in class. After receiving tons of different feedbacks from the instructor as well as my classmates about one of my screenplays, I was completely bewildered. Because I wanted people to like my work, I tried to apply those feedbacks and made changes to my screenplay accordingly. To my surprise, after reading my updated version, people asked me why I changed it and said that they liked the old idea better. I found myself similar to Costi, my protagonist in The Masterpiece. We both desperately force ourselves to please people.</p>
<p>I believe that many young artists are facing the same problems as I do. Therefore, I want to tell this story visually as a lesson and a motivation for all of us to be true to ourselves and keep moving forward to pursue what we believe is right even when it does not bring us reputation or recognition. </p>

<p>Duyen Nguyen - Writer Director</p>
<p>Filmmaking is my passion for life. I have been working as a writer/director throughout my four years of college in Japan as well as my MFA program at Full Sail University. Those projects consist of three 2-hour plays, 4 short films, 1 documentary and two commercials as well as numerous short promotional videos for Japanese organizations. I also worked as a Media Creator position during my internship at Wancher.Inc in Oita, Japan. During that time, I was in charge of creating content and producing the fundraising video for the ""Deam Pen"" project that later became the most funded project for fountain pen on Kickstarter. Thanks to my multicultural background, I want to bring a new perspective into every film I make so that the audience can have a fresher approach to mainstream topics. </p>
<p>Steven Lamar - Producer</p>
<p>With a passion for creating, Steven Lamar is a creator of all sorts. As a graphic designer, videographer, and photographer, he has played a vital role in the marketing world producing creative content for the past seven years. Moving his creative skills into the film industry in 2018, Steven Lamar now serves as a video editor, producer, and director. His keen sense of details and marketing background will play an essential role in producing the vibrant and colorful world of our film.</p>
<p>Anna Ruth Brown - Producer </p>
<p>Anna ’s interest in film began when she was five years old, and throughout her childhood and high school years she worked on developing her craft. During her time at Full Sail University she has developed skills in many different departments, including lighting, directing, writing, and producing.</p>
<p>Khann Le Nguyen - Cinematographer</p>
<p>Khann has been pursuing his passion for cinematography for more than 5 years. With his meticulousness, Khann is one of the most trustworthy DP at Full Sail University.

<p>The money raised is used for creating the stunning production design with numerous paintings and authentic costumes to emphasize the 90's look of the film, nutritious meals for the amazing casts and crews during the 3 days of shooting and distribution fee to enter the film festivals. </p>
<p>Production design: $800 for the original and messy paintings, 90's authentic hair and costume, a quirky suit for Gunocatui, an overall for Costi, the food stall's signs, all the props that create the ""accidental masterpiece"" such as hotdog, coffee, ketchup, soccer balls, etc.</p>
<p>Food: 3 days</p>
<p>1st day- 30 people: $250</p>
<p>2nd day - 15 people: $150</p>
<p>3rd day - 15 people: $150</p>
<p>Production Design: $800</p>
<p>Festival Application fee: $200</p>
<p>Posters and Rewards for backers: $200</p>
<p>Back up: $250</p>
<p>We are lucky enough to receive the free resource of equipment including professional lighting system and Arri Alexa camera as well as the location from our school. That is why we believe with $2000, we can produce the film with high quality.</p>
<p>If you are interested in our project but do not have the resources to help, don't worry! You can still lend us a hand by: </p>
<p>- Spreading our campaign to your family and friends to give us a hand</p>
<p>- Providing any foods, drink or snack if you can. It will help us a great deal to keep the best energy on set.</p>

<p>Funding can help create significant difference in film production.</p>
<p>I would not say that we cannot make a good movie with zero budget because during my study at Full Sail University, I have been to many low budget productions and the outcomes was fantastic.</p>
<p>However, financial constraint strongly prevents us from extending our creativity and quality to the next level. Therefore, with The Masterpiece, I really hope that we get enough financial support to deliver our best performances, especially because this screenplay requires meticulous art design to set up the colorful and quirky world that I want to show my audience.</p>

<p>There are 2 biggest challenges to produce this film. They are the authentic 90's production design and large sums of extras to create the real atmosphere on a side walk in New York City. </p>
<p>In order to reduce the cost of catering, we will shift all the wide shots that requires extras to the first day.</p>
<p>Instead of buying new costume, one of my friends helps us create the layout for the outfits and we will try to utilize what we can find at the thrift shop that fit the concept of the film</p>
<p>Instead of buying painted painting, we decided to make everything from scratch with the help of our talented production designer and his friend. That way we will only have to pay for the paints and canvas.</p>

Everybody says that I'm lucky to know what I want to do in life and that I am lucky enough to even get the opportunity to be here, in the US, to follow my dream. Yes, I am a lucky girl. But it took me quite a while to have enough courage to overcome all my self-doubt, insecurities and fears, to get out of my comfort zone and start my journey with filming. And trust me when I say this: that journey has never been easy. Now, as I am surrounded by the creative world that I yearn to be in my whole life, I struggle from internal conflict every day. As a young artist, I usually find myself in a dilemma - being true to my own artistic view or following what people like. Because you cannot just make art for self-enjoyment, but at the same time you also want to be recognized as who you truly are. There is no right or wrong in the art world because everything is subjective. Everything sounds so simple but when it comes to reputation and recognition, it is really hard to make the right decision.  I realize that learning to be true to who you are while being open to criticism is the key to survive and develop as an artist.
The idea of The Masterpiece hit me when I was struggling with the screen writing workshops in class. After receiving tons of different feedbacks from the instructor as well as my classmates about one of my screenplays, I was completely bewildered. Because I wanted people to like my work, I tried to apply those feedbacks and made changes to my screenplay accordingly. To my surprise, after reading my updated version, people asked me why I changed it and said that they liked the old idea better. I found myself similar to Costi, my protagonist in The Masterpiece. We both desperately force ourselves to please people.
I believe that many young artists are facing the same problems as I do. Therefore, I want to tell this story visually as a lesson and a motivation for all of us to be true to ourselves and keep moving forward to pursue what we believe is right even when it does not bring us reputation or recognition. 
 
 












 
 


Duyen Nguyen - Writer Director
Filmmaking is my passion for life. I have been working as a writer/director throughout my four years of college in Japan as well as my MFA program at Full Sail University. Those projects consist of three 2-hour plays, 4 short films, 1 documentary and two commercials as well as numerous short promotional videos for Japanese organizations. I also worked as a Media Creator position during my internship at Wancher.Inc in Oita, Japan. During that time, I was in charge of creating content and producing the fundraising video for the ""Deam Pen"" project that later became the most funded project for fountain pen on Kickstarter. Thanks to my multicultural background, I want to bring a new perspective into every film I make so that the audience can have a fresher approach to mainstream topics. 
Steven Lamar - Producer
With a passion for creating, Steven Lamar is a creator of all sorts. As a graphic designer, videographer, and photographer, he has played a vital role in the marketing world producing creative content for the past seven years. Moving his creative skills into the film industry in 2018, Steven Lamar now serves as a video editor, producer, and director. His keen sense of details and marketing background will play an essential role in producing the vibrant and colorful world of our film.
Anna Ruth Brown - Producer 
Anna ’s interest in film began when she was five years old, and throughout her childhood and high school years she worked on developing her craft. During her time at Full Sail University she has developed skills in many different departments, including lighting, directing, writing, and producing.
Khann Le Nguyen - Cinematographer

He has been working as DP and camera department for numerous production on and outside campus includings short films, music videos and documentaries. Khann has also developed himself as a professional steadicam operator. Check out his IMDB:
https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9877344/?ref_=nv_sr_1
Ryan Rainey - Production Designer
Ryan Rainey was a stop motion animator for six years until going to college to study Film. He began working in production design early 2018 after his first film. He has been working on many others building and designing the sets and props for each project. Ryan is looking forward to creating the colorful world the artist of the film live.
 


The money raised is used for creating the stunning production design with numerous paintings and authentic costumes to emphasize the 90's look of the film, nutritious meals for the amazing casts and crews during the 3 days of shooting and distribution fee to enter the film festivals. 
Production design: $800 for the original and messy paintings, 90's authentic hair and costume, a quirky suit for Gunocatui, an overall for Costi, the food stall's signs, all the props that create the ""accidental masterpiece"" such as hotdog, coffee, ketchup, soccer balls, etc.
Food: 3 days
1st day- 30 people: $250
2nd day - 15 people: $150
3rd day - 15 people: $150
Production Design: $800
Festival Application fee: $200
Posters and Rewards for backers: $200
Back up: $250
We are lucky enough to receive the free resource of equipment including professional lighting system and Arri Alexa camera as well as the location from our school. That is why we believe with $2000, we can produce the film with high quality.
If you are interested in our project but do not have the resources to help, don't worry! You can still lend us a hand by: 
- Spreading our campaign to your family and friends to give us a hand
- Providing any foods, drink or snack if you can. It will help us a great deal to keep the best energy on set.
 


Funding can help create significant difference in film production.
I would not say that we cannot make a good movie with zero budget because during my study at Full Sail University, I have been to many low budget productions and the outcomes was fantastic.
However, financial constraint strongly prevents us from extending our creativity and quality to the next level. Therefore, with The Masterpiece, I really hope that we get enough financial support to deliver our best performances, especially because this screenplay requires meticulous art design to set up the colorful and quirky world that I want to show my audience.

 

There are 2 biggest challenges to produce this film. They are the authentic 90's production design and large sums of extras to create the real atmosphere on a side walk in New York City. 
In order to reduce the cost of catering, we will shift all the wide shots that requires extras to the first day.
Instead of buying new costume, one of my friends helps us create the layout for the outfits and we will try to utilize what we can find at the thrift shop that fit the concept of the film
Instead of buying painted painting, we decided to make everything from scratch with the help of our talented production designer and his friend. That way we will only have to pay for the paints and canvas.

 

We are planning to shoot the film in February 2019 with 3 days of shooting at Full Sail University's backlot in Winter Park, Florida. The film is estimated to be 7 minutes long. Post- production is expected to take 1 month. When it is finished and polished, we will submit it to the worldwide film festival. Since you are a part of the film, we will keep you guys updated about the process during pre-production and production on our official website here.Thank you so much for your support. Let's bring this story to life together.Best regards, Duyen Nguyen",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Thirteen-year-old strong-willed Mercy who is struggling to understand why her family is falling apart. To cope and navigate the new family dynamic, she masks her pain through anger and rebellion.</p>
<p>When we first meet her, she's with her father Emiliano at The Recovering Hearts Assembly; his court-assigned therapy group. The participants share their painful stories and the courageous steps they've taken to heal. Instead of seeing these as an opportunity for growth, they only fuel Mercy's pain and anger. By the time Mercy's father shares his story and his desires to create a better relationship with her, she explodes with her frustrations of believing in something that was found not to be true and that -- because of him -- she's become an Atheist.</p>
<p>With encouragement from a participant in the group, Mercy finds it deep down to forgive her father and make peace in order to maintain a healthy relationship.</p>

</div></div>","It all begins with...
Thirteen-year-old strong-willed Mercy who is struggling to understand why her family is falling apart. To cope and navigate the new family dynamic, she masks her pain through anger and rebellion.
When we first meet her, she's with her father Emiliano at The Recovering Hearts Assembly; his court-assigned therapy group. The participants share their painful stories and the courageous steps they've taken to heal. Instead of seeing these as an opportunity for growth, they only fuel Mercy's pain and anger. By the time Mercy's father shares his story and his desires to create a better relationship with her, she explodes with her frustrations of believing in something that was found not to be true and that -- because of him -- she's become an Atheist.
With encouragement from a participant in the group, Mercy finds it deep down to forgive her father and make peace in order to maintain a healthy relationship.
The story explores the theme that love takes off masks that we fear we cannot live without and know we cannot live within.


To Create the Best, We Need the Best.
From equipment to talented and skilled people, the $3,400 will help us cover the following:
The Perfect Location for our scenesNVisionate Studios in Burbank has the sets we can customize to fit the hospital and living room locations we need for the film.


Highland Park Ebell Club in Highland Park has a open space where we can capture the Recovery Group scenes in an artistic and visually appealing way

Even if we don't reach the full $3,400, we intend to split the funds we do raise between the various departments below:

If we do raise more than our goal, this will ensure a higher production value with our equipment, set design, and post production.

But behind all the love and luxury, Delilah is stuck in a relationship full of abuse and darkness, subjecting herself to beatings, and surrounded by the dirty and disturbing reality of the crime world.The film follows her inner journey in search for the self value and courage needed to break away from the abuse and from the life of crime, as she questions how far she should go for the love she thinks she deserves and feels. Director's Statement:- “My Dear Delilah” is, above all, a very personal piece. During the creation process, this project took a very heavy toll on me - both physically and emotionally - as I searched for the most accurate tone and truthful way to express what it means to suffer from love, and the agony surrounding the reality of abusive relationships. Inspired by classic Noir, this film strives to bring very real events, into an almost surreal reality, atemporal and dramatized into what is a world of it’s own. Crime, abuse, despair, revenge, and search for freedom, all thrown into a time capsule with the look of the 20s, setting of the 80s and freshness of modern days. This is the story of the becoming of a femme-fatale, but more than that, is Delilah’s journey towards self-worth, and all that has to be sacrificed on her hard path. I hope I can shine a light into what, unfortunately, is a reality for many women, and make others take into consideration how many moments of quiet pain and suffering have been involved in the shaping of their life stories. I hope, also, that it will be an enjoyable film, and that the emotions come through to the watcher, as purely as possible. - Julia BasquesWhat You Should Know:This short film is being produced with the intention of entering national and international Film Festival circuits. After gathering all my personal funds to put into this project, I am requesting your help in funding so that I can bring it to it's fullest potential. This very stylized piece brings to action a decade-play, mixing elements of the roaring 20s, the crime and drug-filled 80s, and the freshness of modern days, to represent the atemporality of the subject in discussion. Produced at the New York Film Academy, the production has been provided with a RED Scarlet package, basic sound gear and a Lighting Kit. Locations and all cast and crew have been locked down and accommodated into my personal funds for the budget.All gathered  funding will be placed towards production design and technicals such as lighting and sound gear, and post-production work (professional sound mixing and designing & professional color correction).For the full Producer Package, and more specific breakdowns in budgeting, please contact  baskoirfilms@gmail.com. Cast and Crew:Julia Basques - Writer/Director; ProducerJulia Basques is a passionate filmmaker, currently studying for her Bachelors in Fine Arts degree at the New York Film Academy - South Beach.

<h2 style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong><font> Imagine overcoming depression with 1 pill. </font></strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><font>This is the vision that got this documentary started.</font></p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">how can we more effectively cure a number of mental illnesses (depression, anxiety, PTSD, addiction),</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong>~ THE STORY ~</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Wendi. I just finished my freshman year at Princeton, and have been taking a gap year since the fall of 2019 to pursue my artistic passions. It was on a subway ride in mid-August when it occurred to me that I would really like to make a feature-length documentary, about some of my friends. And I wanted to spend a whole year, or two, on it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">These are some of the weirdest people I have met. </h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>I remember meeting several of them for the first time at Princeton’s Envision Conference in December 2018. I’d had hours of mind-blowing conversations with these science majors about meditation, consciousness, literature, existential risks, society’s future.</p>
<p>Then, in a dinner circle, they said they were interested in psychedelics.</p>
<p>So unprepared to hear this, I secretly pulled out my phone and googled — <i>yes, they <u>are</u> talking about drugs, hard drugs that produce hallucinations.</i></p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<br/>It turned out, most of these students—these newfound friends that I knew right away were going to change my life—had gone to really dark places mentally.</h3>
<p style=""text-align: right;margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p>At various points not so long ago, they couldn’t find a justification to continue living.</p>
<p>One of them was sent to an eating disorder clinic for a few months.</p>
<p>Several of them engaged with serious suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>Somewhere on their own paths of healing, they discovered psychedelics. Simply reading about psychedelics research on the internet served as a main source of hope for a long time. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>While pursuing medicine, neuroscience, or computer science, they went on establishing student clubs on psychedelics—compounds that have been heavily associated with the uncritical and unscientific hippie culture from the 1960s.</p>
<p>In the past few years, their journeys with the psychedelic clubs were filled with all sorts of emotional experiences:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>being reluctantly bound to a hippie culture they don’t identify with,</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>failing to find an official faculty advisor after 10 of them expressed verbal support,</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>selling 1000 tickets in 10 minutes for the first public event, and,</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>losing a friend they started the club with as she took away her own life</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In October 2019, they established the <strong><a href=""https://www.pennpsychedelics.org/ipn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Intercollegiate Psychedelic Network</a> (IPN)</strong>, which, within the first 3 months, has grown to include <strong>almost 20 colleges from the US, UK, and Switzerland, </strong>with several more universities in the progress of setting up their own psychedelic clubs. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The IPN</span> is organizing <strong><a href=""https://www.paradiseinstitute.org/?fbclid=IwAR19y008uGRY5YpOZ4ubyaZjwAgvUo4wes48nlmAj-pXrokVgbUT7kaeuVA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the 2nd Intercollegiate Psychedelic Summit</a></strong> on April 17-20, 2020, on Harvard campus, a<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">lmost 60 years after Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert got expelled from Harvard for their psychedelics research.</span> </p>
<p>Some of the confirmed speakers include:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">a former President of the American Psychiatric Association (APA),</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Psychiatrist-in-Chief of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH),</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">cofounder of the World Transhumanist Association, and</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">the Founder and Executive Director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>These students are passionate about psychedelics with a serious cause. The individuals this documentary focuses on are simply a few in the larger movement among colleges and the broader community in the West working on psychedelics research and decriminalization. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I feel fortunate to have been introduced to psychedelics by my friends, to witness what they have been continuously achieving, and, now, to tell their stories.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Ever since I picked up and devoured Michael Pollan's <i>How to Change Your Mind</i> right at the beginning of 2019, I felt compelled to learn more about psychedelics because of my long-time passion for mental health. And throughout 2019, I felt like I was witnessing history happen in front of my eyes. </p>
<p>The friends I met in December 2018 went on to establish psychedelic clubs at Harvard in February, at Penn in April (where they organized the 1st Intercollegiate Psychedelic Summit), and at Princeton in October. Then in the fall I found out about UCL's psychedelic society and its beautiful story spanning the last 4 years, which <strong>brought tears to my eyes when I read the long message from its founder</strong>.</p>
<p>I could not imagine <i>not</i> having something documented seriously.</p>
<p>This documentary could seem quite ambitious for a fresh young filmmaker like me. But, imagine witnessing history happen around you, imagine you happen to be friends with the people who are part of this history, imagine you happen to be taking a gap year and you are deeply committed to art, who would resist at least <i>trying</i> to make the documentary happen? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The past 4 months of developing this project were filled with excitement and hope, as well as doubt and fear. I can't believe I am releasing this campaign and sharing with more people about this project that's tremendously important to me. </p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Imagine overcoming depression with 1 pill. 
 
This is the vision that got this documentary started.
 
In the more formal way of speaking, this is a documentary about several students setting up psychedelic clubs at the University College London, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania, and Princeton University, promoting the study of psychedelics for mental health and consciousness research, and expanding into an intercollegiate network across a few countries. 
But I could also say, it is a one-year video journal of my friends and I’s journey on finding out how psychedelic drugs could help solve a few problems in our society: 
how can we more effectively cure a number of mental illnesses (depression, anxiety, PTSD, addiction),
better understand what consciousness is, and
alleviate human suffering?
 
 
~ THE STORY ~
 
My name is Wendi. I just finished my freshman year at Princeton, and have been taking a gap year since the fall of 2019 to pursue my artistic passions. It was on a subway ride in mid-August when it occurred to me that I would really like to make a feature-length documentary, about some of my friends. And I wanted to spend a whole year, or two, on it.
 
These are some of the weirdest people I have met. 
 
I remember meeting several of them for the first time at Princeton’s Envision Conference in December 2018. I’d had hours of mind-blowing conversations with these science majors about meditation, consciousness, literature, existential risks, society’s future.
Then, in a dinner circle, they said they were interested in psychedelics.
So unprepared to hear this, I secretly pulled out my phone and googled — yes, they are talking about drugs, hard drugs that produce hallucinations.

It turned out, most of these students—these newfound friends that I knew right away were going to change my life—had gone to really dark places mentally.
 
At various points not so long ago, they couldn’t find a justification to continue living.
One of them was sent to an eating disorder clinic for a few months.
Several of them engaged with serious suicidal thoughts.
Somewhere on their own paths of healing, they discovered psychedelics. Simply reading about psychedelics research on the internet served as a main source of hope for a long time. 
 
 
While pursuing medicine, neuroscience, or computer science, they went on establishing student clubs on psychedelics—compounds that have been heavily associated with the uncritical and unscientific hippie culture from the 1960s.
In the past few years, their journeys with the psychedelic clubs were filled with all sorts of emotional experiences:
being reluctantly bound to a hippie culture they don’t identify with,
failing to find an official faculty advisor after 10 of them expressed verbal support,
selling 1000 tickets in 10 minutes for the first public event, and,
losing a friend they started the club with as she took away her own life
 
 
In October 2019, they established the Intercollegiate Psychedelic Network (IPN), which, within the first 3 months, has grown to include almost 20 colleges from the US, UK, and Switzerland, with several more universities in the progress of setting up their own psychedelic clubs. 
The IPN is organizing the 2nd Intercollegiate Psychedelic Summit on April 17-20, 2020, on Harvard campus, almost 60 years after Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert got expelled from Harvard for their psychedelics research. 
Some of the confirmed speakers include:
a former President of the American Psychiatric Association (APA),
Psychiatrist-in-Chief of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH),
cofounder of the World Transhumanist Association, and
the Founder and Executive Director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies. 
 
 
These students are passionate about psychedelics with a serious cause. The individuals this documentary focuses on are simply a few in the larger movement among colleges and the broader community in the West working on psychedelics research and decriminalization. 
 
I feel fortunate to have been introduced to psychedelics by my friends, to witness what they have been continuously achieving, and, now, to tell their stories.
​

 
~ BUDGET ~
 

The money this campaign raises will be used in 3 ways:
1. Equipment 
$5928

Canon C100 + 1 zoom lens(this is one of the cheapest film cameras for professional productions. It's cheaper this way than renting the camera for the whole time. I have already paid out of my own pocket for the other necessary equipments)
rental of 1 camera for 1 more filmmaker for several days, to get more dynamic views for events

 
2. My personal travel expenses 
$2649

5 US cities, 1.5 months
plane and bus tickets + food + splitting the time between youth hostels + crashing my friends' rooms

 
3. *****Funding a few subjects to take psychedelics for the film in Amsterdam!!*****
$6157  

6 days
flights (from the east coast & China) + youth hostels + basic food & transport
3-5 subjects of the film + me + 1 other filmmaker

 
Magic truffles (a type of psychedelics) are legal in Amsterdam. If we get enough money, I will fund a few subjects of the documentary to take magic truffles in front of the camera, so that the documentary shows the entire process of how some of the students featured in the film use psychedelics to heal and gain personal insights. 
This is perhaps the most important part of the documentary. A lot of people are scared or concerned about psychedelics because of how crazy and unfathomable psychedelic experiences could sound like. I believe that a huge part of legitimizing psychedelics has to come from visually showing what psychedelic experiences look like when they are induced with care and seriousness.
Given the current stigma, researchers most often can't talk about their personal use, which makes it a precious things that a few of the subjects of this film agreed to take psychedelics in front of the camera. 
 
 
Extra money raised will go into:


leveling up the film's quality: music commission with other artists, VFX work

outreach: festival submissions, traveling expenses for visiting organizations and individuals for further promotion work 

 

 

~ BACKGROUND ~
 
There is a ""psychedelic renaissance.""
We are inheriting a legacy from ancestors, including indigenous cultures that have used psychedelics from millennia, as well as the researchers of the 1900s. 
Now we must ask ourselves - what will our legacy in using these tools for healing and growth be?
 
While psychedelics are still classified as Schedule I (US) and Class A (UK) drugs--the same groups as heroin, more and more research has shown promising effects of psychedelics in treating a number of mental illnesses: depression, PTSD, anxiety in cancer patients, alcohol addiction, and more.
 
Imperial College London, Johns Hopkins University, and New York University have been three major universities in psychedelic research in the past few years.
Several cities in the US and a few other Western countries are decriminalizing psychedelics.
Famous podcasters Joe Rogan (7 million Youtube subscribers) and Tim Ferriss (often ranked #1 business podcast on all of Apple Podcasts) have both dedicated multiple episodes to a range of psychedelics. Tim Ferriss is also a major donor of the world's first two psychedelic research centers that opened in 2019. 
 
A little timeline of the very recent events:
 
June 2018 - Harvard journalism professor Michael Pollan published How to Change Your Mind, a book about the history of psychedelics and his own psychedelic experiences. The New York Times Book Review listed the book as one of the 10 best books of the year.
October 2018 - FDA granted psilocybin ""Breakthrough Therapy"" for Compass Pathways' psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression
April 2019 - Imperial College London opened its Centre for Psychedelic Research -- first of its kind in the world
May 2019 - Denver (CO) became the 1st US city to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms
June 2019 - Oakland (CA) became the 2nd US city to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms, while also decriminalizing DMT, ibogaine, and mescaline
September 2019 - Johns Hopkins University opened its Center for Psychedelic & Consciousness Research, with $17 million in research funding
November 2019 - FDA granted psilocybin a ""Breakthrough Therapy"" status for treating depression for the second time in over a year
now - activists in California and Oregon are pushing for state-wide decriminalization and legalization, respectively, of psychedelics. Berkeley (CA), Chicago (IL), Columbia (MI), Dallas (TX), Portland (OR), Port Townsend (WA), and Santa Cruz (CA) see city-level decriminalization efforts.

I'm excited to share my friends' stories with more people.
People who are frustrated by the current mental health system, in which medicine often doesn't work and therapy is costly and time-consuming.
People who are open to new possibilities of envisioning a more joyful future. 
 
Your support will mean a lot to me, to people in the film, and the hundreds more students, researchers and activists of psychedelics.

<p>         Hello, for those of you who don't know me, my name is Donavan Edwards. I am a filmmaker based in Columbus, OH. I just want to say a quick thank you to all of you that have contributed so far it truly means a lot. As a filmmaker, I've dreamed of making a short film at this scale for a while and I feel like now is the right time. I originally started making videos when I was 14 yrs old, and throughout the years I've been able to watch myself grow as a man and as a filmmaker. These last couple of years have been a blast as I've been able to branch out and travel more as well as work with big companies and organizations such as; Microsoft. Muskingum University, MLG, CAAMP, Root Insurance and more! And it doesn't stop there as I've worked on a number of narrative and personal projects. I'm excited to work on this short film and bring my vision to life for everyone to see. Once again, thank you, everyone, for all the love and support and wish me luck!</p>

<p><strong>About the Team</strong></p>
<p>Most of the crew has been congregated at MET Film School, in London, but they all come from different countries and backgrounds.</p>
<p>The director has studied art and film in Edinburgh, literature in Colombia and film, photography and acting in La Havana, Prague and New York.</p>
<p>This is an ambitious project, and we're bringing to it as much as we can to make it as great as it can possibly be. We have a team of passionate filmmakers and artists on their own craft (make up, music, sound, illustration) working very enthusiastically on the project. The only thing we're lacking is the financial support to bring it all to terms. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Most of the funds will be designated to make up and special effects, both in preproduction (make up) and post production (sound design). The rest will be for the film production basics (food, transport, location). And if we exceed our goal we'll be able to spend it on distribution, which means you'll have an even better chance to see the film at a proper screening in festivals!</p>

My 12 years working with foreign film productions has helped me to extend my experience, and allowed me to learn stories through many perspectives. Since 2007, <strong>I had the chance to work closely with Rithy Panh, Regis Wargnier, Chantal Akerman, Jeanne Labrune, Angelina Jolie</strong>,... and many more prestigious film directors from different parts of the world. Working with experienced filmmakers allowed me to open my mind and wander further into the world of cinema.</p><p>I decided to direct my own films because I think <strong>I am ready to tell the stories that I always wanted to tell</strong>. I am 35 now, and I have been through a lot in my life and this experience is my inspiration, and this is what I want to share in my films. <strong>I believe that films can connect and change people in some ways. </strong>As a new generation rising from a dark period, we have been passing by waves of changes and today <strong>our generation needs to find answers and to speak up!</strong> I want to find and tell my part and you can help me do that!</p><p>GREY FEATHER is my first film as a director</p><h3><strong>WHAT IS THE FILM ABOUT ?</strong></h3><p>The story talks about <strong>a Cambodian girl who confronts her own will, </strong>her own culture as she decides to free herself, to break the barriers she's been locked in for many years. Sarita RETH, our fabulous character challenges, not only women, but people in Cambodia, and the rest of the world<strong> to define the meaning of “Being Free”.</strong></p><h3><strong>WHY I'M MAKING THIS FILM ?</strong></h3><p>The topic is very important, as I have been myself and other friends confronted with many questions about our culture. I see that <strong>most of us live in a locked world, where options are limited by society, or sometimes also by our own will</strong>. Only a few actually dare to bypass the rules they have been told; and when they dare to, fear and doubt are always around. <strong>This story is about CHOICES.</strong></p><p><strong>We live in a modern society now and people can more and more access and question everything, when thinking about our culture, I always wonder where it comes from and what value it has today, why it is so powerful?</strong></p><p>How far we can go to against ourselves, our own roots, and a society where our culture has always been in our blood and build our own mindset. Education is very important, but I believe that our daily life has a huge power to inspires us the most. It is hard to leave those things behind. Some people might think to fight for their freedom, we only need strong commitment and strength to win it, but in the reality is not simple as that.</p><p>GREY FEATHER was <strong>produced with a very dedicated and professional crew</strong>. After some time in the editing studio, I know the production value of the film, and I believe that a <strong>proper post-production would be an amazing additional and essential gift to the film</strong>, and would allow that story to travel and captivate audience around the world. GREY FEATHER is my first film, and I already know that this is not my last one.</p><p><strong>Any support from the team and from you, means so much to me,</strong> to my world and to my career. In Cambodia, it is very hard for filmmakers to get any support locally. You can also <strong>imagine what it takes as a female filmmaker to stand up and tell such a not-so-conventional story. </strong>But obstacles and strong winds won't discourage me from taking that road.</p><p>This film not only tells about Cambodian women and culture, but it is also <strong>a reflection for women all over the world</strong>, who face similar questions. Your contribution to THIS film will also help all the next films that I will do!!!</p><h3><strong>THE STORY SO FAR …</strong></h3><p>After 4 months working on the edit, <strong>the film is already here and it’s looking great</strong>. We are seeking for 5,000 USD to achieve the last step, a GOOD POST PRODUCTION: SOUND DESIGN + COLOUR GRADING + some VISUAL EFFECTS, before delivering “GREY FEATHER” out to world. These funds will be used to rent costly post-production facilities in Cambodia, Bangkok (and maybe France) - usually 500 to 1000 USD a day x 3 days -  and pay salaries to professional technicians who are working or will be soon working on finishing the film. That includes a travel fee for my team (Colorist, Sound Designer) and myself. Once post is done, we will also need a proper subtitling in French and Khmer language and to create Digital Cinema Package (DCP) that will require a few hard drives. The rest of the funds will be used as submission fees for film festivals that cost each time between 25USD to 75USD.</p><p>Aside your contribution makes you feel great by <strong>showing your support and trust to a debut Cambodian Female Filmmaker</strong>, you will get opportunities to be updated about our film selection, its premiers, its parties and production souvenirs.</p><p><strong>And you will be part of creating something that will last longer than your own life!</strong></p><p>In any case, the film will need to be done, in a proper way. <strong>Meeting the quality standard we are aiming at now depends on YOUR contributions</strong>. If at the end of the campaign, we could not reach our goal, we would finish the film with what we have. Please be sure that your contribution will be for the film and ONLY for the film.</p><h3><strong>CELEBRATE THE TEAM !</strong></h3><p>GREY FEATHER is<strong> made with love </strong>and it's a teamwork as is any film!!!</p><p>Without strong support from my friends and my wonderful crew, I wouldn’t be able to make this film.<strong> I want to express my gratitude for the support, inspiration and encouragements from Rithy Panh, Chantal Akerman, Sok Visal, Chandara So, Jean-Pierre Garcia, Cedric Eloy, Christine Chansou</strong>.</p><p><strong>A BIG SHOUT OUT FOR A WONDERFUL FRIENDS, CAST &amp; CREW !</strong></p><ul><li><strong>JEREMIAH OVERMAN, my friend and talented DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY:</strong></li></ul><p>We’ve met a bout a year and half ago while working on a feature film togther, since then we became friends and did together both fun and difficult projects.Jeremiah is a cinematographer, video editor and an all-around image wizzard. He started off ten years ago documenting the US skateboarding scene and making music videos - a passion he later continued developing at the Art Institute of Portland, while studying Digital Media Production. Today, he makes commercials, music videos and narrative films. Only in 2018, he shot three feature films, including “The Prey” by the acclaimed director Jimmy Henderson and “Young Love” by first time feature director Lomorpich Rithy. He has become very quickly recognised in the film industry and is very high demand.</p><ul><li><strong>MARTA KASZTELAN, PRODUCER and 1st AD</strong></li></ul><p>Marta is a human rights lawyer, freelance journalist and filmmaker. In all three capacities she works mainly on gender and for the advancement of women’s rights. It is that thematic that drew her to GREY FEATHER in the first place. Her most notable films, which she directed and produced, include “Pretty Radical” and “Real Autism”. These are short documentary films, which premiered online and both went viral. The first was commissioned by UK’s The Guardian and the second by Al Jazeera. Although originally from Poland, she has lived and worked in the UK, France, India and Cambodia.</p><ul><li><strong>SOPHEAKTRA PHONG: My best friend and the MOST RELIABLE PRODUCTION MANAGER in CAMBODIA</strong></li></ul><p>Sopheaktra, or just call her TRA, has begins her career in Film Production in late 2017 just right after she finished her university in Journalism. She works as Second AD with me in a local Feature films, “The Spell”, “Young Love” and a French Production’s Film “Onoda - 10000 Nights in the Jungle” lately.</p><p>Aside, she works on many International and local productions, included Features, TV series, shorts, documentaries, TVC and few campaigns related to environment, climate change programs.</p><ul><li><strong>SARITA RETH, LEAD ACTRESS</strong></li></ul><p>My favorite Actress of all times</p><p>Sarita’s passion for the film industry started at a young age after watching Hollywood actress Ange-lina Jolie star in the blockbuster film, Tomb Raider. The movie was popular among young Cambodians due to the film’s location shooting at the ancient temple ruins in Siem Reap, and Jolie’s advocacy for and close relationship to the Cambodian community. At the age of 17, Sarita started competing in beauty pageants and talent competitions, which eventually led her landing in full-time anchor for BBC Media Action’s TV series ""Love9"".</p><p>She starred in short films that include “Happiness” (2015), “The Dinner” (2016), “Kidnap” (2017), “The Interview” (2017), as well as several TV dramas. She has also appeared in several feature films including “Mind Cage” (2016), “Love To The Power of Four” (2016), and “HEX” (2017).</p><ul><li><strong>SAMUAL IZAC JAMES or SAM JAMES,</strong></li></ul><p>Fabulous male Actor</p><p>Sam and I met when working in Amit Dubey’s latest Feature film “The Spell”. From his background and skill, he is a great photographer and is better known for his creativity.  Moreover,I found something very special in him as an Actor, he’s got talent. when I talk about the concept of the film, he did say yes immediately. And I know I am so proud of my choice! Unfortunately, he had to leave Cambodia and settle down in Australia just few months after we finished the shooting of Grey Feather.</p><p>Today he keeps doing his amazing job in photography field.</p><ul><li><strong><i>Deeply thank you for the rest of crew that I cannot mention in here, otherwise the text will take 1km long ;-) But you're the best, and you know and I know! </i></strong></li></ul><h3> </h3><h3><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></h3><p><strong>There’s hardly any risk for you to take since the project is already far from its development state </strong>and even close to being finished! The footage are stored in multiple safe places, and the rough cut is already done. <strong>I put a lot of me in the this, and I will make the best of my best </strong>so that GREY FEATHER can be Premiered in the best possible Festival and also shown in many other events and places after that. <strong>Be sure that the film will not be ever abandoned, set aside or forgotten.</strong></p><p>Only one challenge that we now face is to know which of the large festivals will take us first in the selection.</p><p><strong>It has gone to some industry insiders and has had a great response in Cambodia and internationally.  </strong>Being described by Jean-Pierre Garcia (Film Festival Artistic Director and worldwide film consultant for over 40 years) , “<i>A mise en scène that is sophisticated and a magnificent photography, almost too beautiful</i>” and by a Variety Film critic “<i> It’s an engaging portrait of cross-cultural romance, self-determination and uncertainty about the future</i>”. I do know that <strong>very few short films made in Cambodia have received this type of positive feedback</strong>, so I really believe it will find its audience here in Cambodia and somewhere in the world. </p><p>But we have to keep in mind that film festival programmers are curating an event and not just looking at individual films.  The final film will be approximately 21 minutes and we will keep you posted in the blog about Festival selections.</p><h3><strong>THINGS YOU CAN DO TO SUPPORT THIS INDIE FILM :</strong></h3><p>There’s a lot of ways to help us to<strong> show your great supports to a Cambodian female filmmaker</strong>. Your voice is my voice. <strong>GREY FEATHER is a way to really kickstart my work as a director, and built my wings to fly </strong>and to make always better films.</p><p>Please help me to build them and I will open them and fly high with you!</p><p><strong>SHARE, sharing is caring</strong>. You have just contributed to GREY FEATHER, and it would be very helpful if you could share this on social media and encourage people to get involved.  Use the Indiegogo share tools and voila. </p><p><strong>LOVE </strong>only, To really help social media algorithms then you need to love our posts not just like them.  Apparently, facebooks are a bit 'Meh' about likes. So reach for the heart.</p><p>Tweet the campaign and use the hashtags #GREYFEATHER #supportindiefilm #supportwomendirectors #supportcambodianfilms</p></div>","WHO AM I ?My name is Sophea Kim,I am a Cambodian filmmaker, I was born here, I grew up, lived and worked in Cambodia.

She works as Second AD with me in a local Feature films, “The Spell”, “Young Love” and a French Production’s Film “Onoda - 10000 Nights in the Jungle” lately.Aside, she works on many International and local productions, included Features, TV series, shorts, documentaries, TVC and few campaigns related to environment, climate change programs.SARITA RETH, LEAD ACTRESSMy favorite Actress of all timesSarita’s passion for the film industry started at a young age after watching Hollywood actress Ange-lina Jolie star in the blockbuster film, Tomb Raider. The movie was popular among young Cambodians due to the film’s location shooting at the ancient temple ruins in Siem Reap, and Jolie’s advocacy for and close relationship to the Cambodian community. At the age of 17, Sarita started competing in beauty pageants and talent competitions, which eventually led her landing in full-time anchor for BBC Media Action’s TV series ""Love9"".She starred in short films that include “Happiness” (2015), “The Dinner” (2016), “Kidnap” (2017), “The Interview” (2017), as well as several TV dramas. She has also appeared in several feature films including “Mind Cage” (2016), “Love To The Power of Four” (2016), and “HEX” (2017).SAMUAL IZAC JAMES or SAM JAMES,Fabulous male ActorSam and I met when working in Amit Dubey’s latest Feature film “The Spell”. From his background and skill, he is a great photographer and is better known for his creativity.  Moreover,I found something very special in him as an Actor, he’s got talent. when I talk about the concept of the film, he did say yes immediately. And I know I am so proud of my choice! Unfortunately, he had to leave Cambodia and settle down in Australia just few months after we finished the shooting of Grey Feather.Today he keeps doing his amazing job in photography field.Deeply thank you for the rest of crew that I cannot mention in here, otherwise the text will take 1km long ;-) But you're the best, and you know and I know!  RISKS & CHALLENGESThere’s hardly any risk for you to take since the project is already far from its development state and even close to being finished! The footage are stored in multiple safe places, and the rough cut is already done. I put a lot of me in the this, and I will make the best of my best so that GREY FEATHER can be Premiered in the best possible Festival and also shown in many other events and places after that. Be sure that the film will not be ever abandoned, set aside or forgotten.Only one challenge that we now face is to know which of the large festivals will take us first in the selection.It has gone to some industry insiders and has had a great response in Cambodia and internationally.  Being described by Jean-Pierre Garcia (Film Festival Artistic Director and worldwide film consultant for over 40 years) , “A mise en scène that is sophisticated and a magnificent photography, almost too beautiful” and by a Variety Film critic “ It’s an engaging portrait of cross-cultural romance, self-determination and uncertainty about the future”. I do know that very few short films made in Cambodia have received this type of positive feedback, so I really believe it will find its audience here in Cambodia and somewhere in the world. But we have to keep in mind that film festival programmers are curating an event and not just looking at individual films.  The final film will be approximately 21 minutes and we will keep you posted in the blog about Festival selections.THINGS YOU CAN DO TO SUPPORT THIS INDIE FILM :There’s a lot of ways to help us to show your great supports to a Cambodian female filmmaker. Your voice is my voice. GREY FEATHER is a way to really kickstart my work as a director, and built my wings to fly and to make always better films.Please help me to build them and I will open them and fly high with you!SHARE, sharing is caring. You have just contributed to GREY FEATHER, and it would be very helpful if you could share this on social media and encourage people to get involved.  Use the Indiegogo share tools and voila. LOVE only, To really help social media algorithms then you need to love our posts not just like them.  Apparently, facebooks are a bit 'Meh' about likes.

<p>The Abraham Lincoln, Douglas Debates film tells the story of the lead up to the famous October 7, 1858 debate.  Lincoln and Douglas each have their supporters and are passionately preparing for this great political event. We touch on the Kansas/Nebraska Act, Popular Sovereignty, the Dred Scott case, Lecompton, Lincoln’s House Divide speech, La Compton and the Missouri Compromise.</p>
<p>The characters talk about the first four debates and mention the last two upcoming debates.  Even though there are so many intense and controversial topics to discuss, both Lincoln and Douglas focus their debate to the number one issue that is tearing the country apart, slavery. </p>
<p>One of the reasons the Galesburg debate remains hugely significant is that at Knox College Abraham Lincoln for the first time talked at length about the immorality of slavery.  In today’s terms, the evils and immorality of slavery seem clear.  But, in 1858, tragically, people were living in a world where slavery was a reality and an issue that deeply divided people.  Even most people opposed to the evils of slavery did not talk in those terms.  People like that were thought to be radical extremists called Abolitionists.  Lincoln significantly changed the national debate and the hearts and minds when he laid out his case for why slavery was immoral and needed to end.</p>
<p>We have gone to great lengths to research the historical accuracy of this film.  We have many of the actual people, that was there at the debate represented, and have tried to incorporate their own words or actions in the dialog.  We have taken some liberty in adding a few people that were very important to the overall story.  Our hope is that people will want to learn their names, and the major issues leading up to this important debate.  </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am proud to be a storyteller.  I am an artist and a business person.  I have professionally worked in the entertainment business for a number of years.  I also have owned and operated several businesses and work in the corporate office as a manager for a fortune 10 company.  I am an artist; I love the craft of film making and I bring a strong business acumen.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>   Your name will be listed in the credits of our film. Sections are determined in the Perks description. We need to raise $15,000.  We have many amazing people that have been volunteering and interning on this project.  It has been a labor of love.  We are passionate about doing this project and telling this incredible story. </p>
<p>    This is a period piece that will have great visuals and cinematic quality.  We would never be able to do a project of this scale without all of the incredibly hard-working volunteers and interns.</p>
<p>   In addition to all of our amazing volunteers, we will be hiring profession filmmakers.  This is where your contribution is desperately needed and where the funds will be allocated.  We need a professional team to capture and make this story come alive.  We will be hiring a line producer, cinematographer, 1<sup>st</sup> Assistant Director, 2<sup>nd</sup> Assistant Director, 2<sup>nd</sup> 2<sup>nd</sup> Assistant Director, Sound, Wardrobe, Hair and Makeup, Art Department.  We will be filming 6 days with one additional day on the front end for set up and one additional day on the back end for breakdown.   There will be 6-8 Production Assistants.   There are two large atmosphere days with over 75 background.  The other film days, we will have a 30+ background. </p>
<p>   This is a very large and ambitious project.  Every penny will be used twice.  It is heavily volunteer based.  Your contribution is greatly appreciated!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a very important story and we need your help to tell it to the world.  This is a great all-American story.  It is very patriot.  Lincoln is one of the most recognized individuals in modern human history.  He lived a difficult but extraordinary life.  He was a very unlikely candidate for the presidency of the United States.  Against overwhelming odds, he found a way, and he saved this country.  He rightfully has become a mythical figure.  Gaining a greater understanding of the man and the difficult choices he had to make and the painful journey he traveled, might give all of us a greater understanding of who we are as a people, a nation and a world. </p>
<p>   I am wholly committed to this project and this story.  There are so many people that have contributed to this project.  There are exceptional individuals that have add so much to this project, because they too believe in this story and this project. </p>

<h3>About <i>Oinya's Prize</i>
</h3>
<p>Mahir and Ahir, the parents of three children — Oinya, Iora, and Caroline — return home after an extended absence. Once settled at home, they attempt to return to their normal lives, but find they can’t, due to the lasting effects of trauma on the Ahir (the father) and, indirectly, on Mahir (the mother). A trophy won by the elder daughter Caroline, symbolizing the family unit, becomes the object of her younger sister Oinya's obsession.</p>
<p>The crisis of the short occurs when Oinya finally has the trophy in hand. As she triumphantly attempts to show her new prize to the family, she bumps into her mother Mahir, dropping the trophy and seeing it shatter. It appears the family may be close to their own breaking point as well. In a moment of clarity, Ahir’s discovery of his own inner strength rallies the family, and they pull together, reshaping the trophy into something new. As he begins to pick up the pieces, he realizes this is exactly what the family needs. </p>
<p>One by one the family members join Ahir and they all begin to create something new. Inspired by a new sense of possibility, the family works together and end up creating a beautiful bowl in the shape of a heart. We see healing begin to take place and are left with the message that while some things cannot be put back the way they were before, they can be transformed into something new that has its own beauty.</p>
<h3>So Who is Drawn from Valor? </h3>
<p>Drawn from Valor is a non-profit animation studio with a passion for helping children and families impacted by medical and mental health conditions. We partner with subject matter experts to create free resources that educate through engaging animated storytelling. We take viewers on empowering journeys to help them manage their conditions and live longer, healthier, happier lives.</p>
<p>Our creative team is made up of a core group of artists and writers with a long-standing passion for visual storytelling, while our administrative and social outreach teams are tireless in their pursuit of the means to connect people, not only to one another, but to the resources necessary to lead better lives.</p>
<p>Our first project, <a href=""https://www.drawnfromvalor.org/diabetes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Kara &amp; the (Not So) Dire Beastie</i></a>, was completed in the summer of 2018 in partnership with Dr. Angelina Bernier, a pediatric endocrinologist from the University of Florida. This 8-episode series, available in both English and Spanish, was created to empower and educate children and their families in managing type 1 diabetes. The 28-minute project is part of Dr. Bernier's New Onset Diabetes Educator (NODE), an interactive website and eBook designed to help patients and their families understand type 1 diabetes, increase access to resources in remote locations, and help them retain important facts and recommended practices ultimately leading to improved health.</p>
<h3>Why is Animation so Special? </h3>
<p>Younger kids often lack the tools or vocabulary to discuss and confront personal issues that are new to them. Animation is a safe, familiar way for them to explore similar problems and solutions. We know that with education, people are empowered to make healthier choices and children grow up to be stronger individuals. Studies have shown that children learn and understand material better — and faster — when it is presented in animated form. They say a picture is worth a thousand words; one second of animation can literally be up to 30 pictures or more.</p>

<h3>The Impact of PTSD / Trauma</h3>
<p>According to the National Center for PTSD, 60% of men and 50% of women will experience some form of trauma in their lives. Of those, varying percentages are at risk for developing PTSD based on the type of trauma they experienced (ranging from an estimated 3.8% impacted by natural disaster to 49% of rape survivors). Additionally anywhere from 14% to 43% of kids have or will encounter a traumatic event in their life. Of those children and teens who have experienced trauma, between 3% — 15% of girls and 1% — 6% of boys develop Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). </p>
<p>Because there is such a great need, we have now begun work on our long-term series, <i>The Tales of the Golden Acorn</i>, beginning with <i>Oinya's Prize</i>. This important series focuses on the impacts and effects of PTSD and trauma on families, shares the various paths to healing, and consistently returns to the core message there is always room for hope.</p>
<p>Drawn from Valor wants people to know they and their loved ones are not alone. For this reason, we are kicking off this project on June 27, National PTSD Awareness Day to literally draw attention to PTSD while raising money to make <i>Oinya's Prize</i>. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why is <i>Oinya's Prize </i>Important?</h3>
<p>Our goal is to give caregivers, children, friends, and their families the tools to learn important information whenever, wherever, and however they want. The animated worlds we create help make complex medical and mental health information accessible to children, and the fantastical stories we tell help them confront personal issues they may not normally feel comfortable addressing, or lack the tools to discuss on their own.</p>
<h3>The Risks &amp; Challenges of Creating Oinya's Prize</h3>
<p>To make a ten minute short like this, our artists and team put in about 3.33 hours of time per second of finished animation. Additionally, each second of animation costs approximately $225. We've set an ambitious goal of $50,000 to begin to fund this 10-minute short film. We know that it will take a lot of work to get there, but we believe we can with your help. But even if we fall short, every dollar you donate to <i>Oinya's Prize</i> will go directly to the cost of animating the project. We are committed to helping kids and families learn about the many paths to healing when dealing with PTSD or trauma in a family setting. We hope you are too!</p>

Growing up in the Bronx I always had the dream of becoming an actor and performer but as a kid I was a bit afraid to go after that dream. In the environment where I was you were looked at as weird If you followed big dreams like being an actor or artist and I didn't want to stand out like that so I didn't really pursue the dream until my senior year in Highschool when I did the musical ""Smokey Joe's cafe"" and that's when my love for musicals was born. I fell in love with other musicals like ""Hairspray"", ""Once on This Island"", and even the oldies like ""Singing in the Rain"". There was one movie called ""Highschool Musical"" that had everything I loved in it (Acting, Singing, Dancing, and Basketball). I watched that movie many times in hopes that one day I could be in a film like that.     ""I Believe"" will be that movie and with your help that dream can be a reality.  This film will not only help me realize my dream but also the dream of my friends. I know a lot of talented people  who don't get many opportunities because in this industry there's not enough to go around. It is very much about who you know or who knows you and If your talent isn't seen by the right people then it's hard for you to move forward in the business.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""Christopher Kahler exited the womb with a video camera in hand and knew at an early age that filmmaking would be his passion"" is what I should say at this junction, but I won't. I did some stop motion animation and some weirdo ninja movies with my friends when we were kids just for laughs. I was into music by high school because being a rock star was an appealing choice not listed as a career on aptitude testing, but was still a great way to meet girls. I ended up in the orchestra since my grandmother had taught me how to read music which is about as unexciting to high school girls as it sounds.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few years and I've scribbled out and recorded my first horror themed score to play at my buddy's annual Halloween party. People asked ""What movie is this from ?"". It's not. I wrote it. ""Well it should be in a movie."" After a few beers, I agree and start looking online to make that happen. It does. I get a VHS movie of my music in a horror movie. It plays over the opening credits of a local stripper in the shower getting fake blood splashed on her fake boobs. It's not scary. I move into the production aspect of filmmaking.</p>Recently, I was stuck in traffic and mindlessly singing along to Motorhead when the lyrics really hit me:<p>'He moves so slowly, but he's coming after you</p>
<p>Nowhere to run or hide, not a thing that you can do</p>
<p>You're on his mind, you're on his mind....'</p>
<p>Damn ! I need to do my own slasher movie with catchy music and fully utilize the multiple suspect storyline. Everybody is doing 80s style so what if I took it back a bit to where it all started ? A GIALLO !</p>
<p>I've worked with dozens of talented people over the years, but would they be down for it ? YES ! I might speed babble when I talk on set because I get excited over details, but the edits tend to prove I'm pretty good at what I do (even won a few awards along the way). Also, I can usually do it on a limited budget since I can work around the locations I'm given. Unfortunately, I need to pay for a few more locations and props this time around which is why I'm not so excited to be asking for your help...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I've been lucky enough (and basically guerrilla enough) to get a lot of my locations for free so far which I wear as a badge of thriftiness to making this movie. That's not to say the production itself has costed nothing. I've dumped my savings into it between flights, food, gas money, etc. because I think it's a cool movie. No matter how cool it might be, my free location scenes are running out quickly and the places, wardrobes, and props for certain scenes coming up are adding up quickly.</p>
<p>I'm not asking for tens of thousands of dollars. Far from it actually. I just need enough to finish this movie I've already started. Every dollar literally gets you involved with an IMDb and movie credit because I don't believe that a social media shout-out properly acknowledges your contribution. Posters and DVDs are an affordable perk, t-shirts are available, and if you wanna go there, the limited edition vinyl LPs of the soundtrack are well within reach. You're doing me a favor and not the other way around. I appreciate it and want to reciprocate appropriately because I literally could not finish this movie within the next few months without you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3> I love the rich lighting, lush music, beautiful people, brutal killings, and twist ending as much as every other giallo fan so I decided to make one myself for selfish reasons. More importantly, I've made a concerted effort to keep the plot focused on the story. This won't replace 'Deep Red' as your favorite, but hopefully a 'Steal Your Face' DVD can share the same shelf in everyone's collection.</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>I suck at asking for help which is why most of this movie is or has been shot on exterior Chicago locations. The few extraordinary interiors fell into my lap by chance and as far as gialli go, these are a must. I can't rewrite other interior scenes to ""just make them happen"" without them looking like they were shot to ""just make them happen"" since they are integral to the overall story. I try to make every shot look like a painting whether it's just an establishing shot or a closeup of someone getting stabbed (and there are a lot of people getting stabbed in this movie).<p>If I absolutely didn't need help to secure these locations, I wouldn't be on IndiGoGo, but S&amp;M bondage chambers and accompanying wardrobe won't come cheap so here I am !</p>

<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>I know what you're asking. Why is the raise goal so high? Well, it's that way for a reason. The film itself has been funded to completion. However, additional funds are needed for marketing and outreach. The funding structure is not fixed, but rather provides room for marketing costs. Without successful marketing, the goal of health care reform will not be achieved. Please consider contributing just $10.  Thank you for your support!</p>

<p>My name is Paul Roberts, and I am the executive producer and writer of the healthcare reform documentary, Diagnosing Healthcare. By trade, I am a veteran RN case manager and the owner of Roberts Consulting, a medical case management firm. Currently, medical case management is only utilized in about 10% of the larger health care market. My vision is to expand these services to the wider market, thereby reducing the burden of cost on the system, while at the same time improving the quality of care delivered. In this endeavor, I developed an alternative health care plan, which I dubbed, ""Coordinated Care for All”. This plan offers a 40% cost savings over ""Medicare for All"", a savings of $1.4 Trillion annually, while improving quality. The plan was endorsed by the Case Management Society of America, as featured in their Nov 2019 edition of CMSA Today. While all of this can be applied to a model for a single-payer source (Universal Healthcare), the same ideas can be applied to the private sector as well. The allowance of pre-existing conditions and competition within the private health care sector are also inclusive in the plan.

<p>Lawmakers have expressed enthusiasm. However, attempts to introduce the plan through a Bill in congress have so far been ineffective.

<p>Through dynamic and engaging footage, the film identifies the most problematic areas of the current mainstream health care system.

In addition to my plan, the film features an exploration of the free-market health care system, an affordable alternative to traditional health insurance.</p>

</div></div>","Summary:
I know what you're asking. Why is the raise goal so high? Well, it's that way for a reason. The film itself has been funded to completion. However, additional funds are needed for marketing and outreach. The funding structure is not fixed, but rather provides room for marketing costs. Without successful marketing, the goal of health care reform will not be achieved. Please consider contributing just $10.  Thank you for your support!

My name is Paul Roberts, and I am the executive producer and writer of the healthcare reform documentary, Diagnosing Healthcare. By trade, I am a veteran RN case manager and the owner of Roberts Consulting, a medical case management firm. Currently, medical case management is only utilized in about 10% of the larger health care market. My vision is to expand these services to the wider market, thereby reducing the burden of cost on the system, while at the same time improving the quality of care delivered. In this endeavor, I developed an alternative health care plan, which I dubbed, ""Coordinated Care for All”. This plan offers a 40% cost savings over ""Medicare for All"", a savings of $1.4 Trillion annually, while improving quality. The plan was endorsed by the Case Management Society of America, as featured in their Nov 2019 edition of CMSA Today. While all of this can be applied to a model for a single-payer source (Universal Healthcare), the same ideas can be applied to the private sector as well. The allowance of pre-existing conditions and competition within the private health care sector are also inclusive in the plan. To learn more about the plan, please visit my blog.

Board Games is a feature length film currently in pre-production with a scheduled shoot of January 10th - February 2nd 2020.
The film is a whodunnit for the modern era.
 
Six college students find themselves in the middle of a grisly mystery after a house party gets out of hand.Elijah, Jeffrey, Scarlet, Emily, Gavin, and Liz were not planning for things to get this screwed up.  Some were escaping something, some were embracing something new. It was just supposed to be another house party, not unlike the hundreds that take place on every college campus. But this one was different.Elijah's apartment is destroyed, and the group has no memory of the night before. The only thing that's certain is they just found a dead body, and the group has a creeping suspicion that someone who spent the night might be responsible.A contemporary twist on a classic genre, Board Games is an intense, mysterious thriller about today's generation. Making a feature length film isn't cheap, and making one for $20,000 isn't easy.The primary expense we've dedicated the budget to is the purchasing, processing, and transferring costs of the 16mm film stock we will be shooting the film on. The entirety of our camera crew has experience shooting on film. The process of working with celluloid film is laborious, and much more costly than shooting on traditional digital cameras. However, we at Board Games adore the color profile and visual texture that shooting on film gives us, for which the images below can attest.""16mm"" Dir: Tyler McClellan (2019)""Deal"" Dir: Timothy Kandra (Creative Producer) (2019)""Into the Night"" Dir: Dakota Cerro (Gaffer) (2019) The other large expense for a film like Board Games is the production design.

<p><i>*our cast and crew will be paid out of pocket </i></p>
<p>Unfortunately there are things that we simply cannot avoid spending money on. Here is a breakdown of what we need and why: </p>
<p><strong>Lighting Rental </strong>while we only need several lights and stands for our shoot, lights are darn expensive! Renting lights in order to make our film look its best is the biggest chunk of our budget.</p>
<p><strong>Grip Rental </strong>the most boring rental, but the foundation of any film set. Our grip rental includes stands for lighting and sandbags to safely hold those heavy stands in place.</p>
<p><strong>Craft </strong>food, glorious food. We need to keep our team fed throughout our shoot! </p>
<p><strong>Wardrobe/Props </strong>our film is set in the 1970s, and we need it to look that way. Our art team has been collecting donated vintage items from friends and family, but we are going to need more in order to dress our sizeable cast and set.</p>
<p><strong>Set Rental </strong>film sets can be fun and exciting, but also extremely chaotic. Most people do not want them inside their own homes. We have decided to rent a large house to shoot in, a la Airbnb. </p>
<p><strong>Truck Rental </strong>we need to get those stands and sandbags around somehow, and Madelyn's dad won't let us use his Honda civic! </p>

<p>In Ontario, Canada, there has been a heated debate on the topic of sex ed amongst educators, parents, and religious leaders. In 2015 a curriculum that hadn't been changed since the 1990s finally got a much needed update. This change to the curriculum was met with backlash and protest, mostly over the introduction of progressive topics, such as the LGBT+ community, gender identity and sexual orientation, and the importance of consent. However, our Ontario government has recently changed, and steps have been taken to roll back the curriculum to its outdated version. Our protagonist, Ellen, dealt with what she believed to be an outdated curriculum in the 1970s. While our short film is funny, timely, and refreshing, the risk of losing an updated sex ed curriculum is not funny. It's easy to leave school and never take a math class again (thank goodness), but regardless of our education, we will continue to live with our sexuality, gender, and evolving bodies and identities for the rest of our lives. Comprehensive sex education allows us to lead healthier lives, both mentally and physically. </p>
<p>We think we have a powerful short film on our hands, and we desperately want to share it with the world. What if we could change the way one person thinks about sex ed? That would be awesome!</p>

<h3>Why Are You Raising Money?</h3>
<p>As an actor my future has more often than not been in the hands of other people. Let me give you my ""favorite"" example: Back in 2014 I booked a role opposite Amy Poehler in a film called The Nest (later retitled Sisters). Not only was this my first Hollywood studio film booking- I was going to get to act with one of my comedy idols. A day before the shoot date I was picked up and driven to Long Island for my fitting. There I saw the Executive Producer and we laughed together, I was fitted by the lovely costume department, took a few over enthusatic selfies in the trailer, and went back to NYC with a stupid grin of ecstasy plastered on my face. The next day I woke up extra early, worked out, drank a bunch of water, meditated, stretched, and imagined how great the day was going to be. Around 3PM, I gathered my things and headed out the door to meet the van going to set. As I turned the corner out of my building, my phone rang. It was a 212 number (which is ALWAYS exciting when you're an actor in NYC). I answered: ""Hello?"". A man's voice answered back ""Hi Julia. This is Mike I'm calling from The Nest."" ""Hi Mike. I'm on the way to the van right now!"" Mike paused and then he said ""So, I know that this was on your list of fun things to do today...but unfortunately we had to cut your scene. I'm sorry"". I acted like it wasn't a big deal, thanked Mike, and hung up. And just like that...everything sucked. <br/><br/>This wouldn't be the first time I would be cut out of something. Or a huge National Network commercial I shot wouldn't air. Or I would be heart broken because I didn't book a life changing role. In fact, since then I've barely booked anything at all. As an actor- I don't fit into a box. So I decided enough was enough and I got back to my roots as a creator and wrote my television pilot <strong>Top Dog</strong>.  </p>
<h3>What is Top Dog about?</h3>
<p>Katie McKenna, a struggling plus-sized actress is smack in the middle of a spiritual crisis about pursuing a career in show business. When a series of kismet events propel her toward the chance at a more meaningful life working with dogs, she follows the scent to Los Angeles where she soon discovers she can’t shake the spotlight just yet because fate has led her into the lap of the largest &amp; most successful talent agency...for dogs. </p>
<p>The series follows Katie McKenna’s surprising rise in the company of Top Dog and the beginning of her journey in self discovery. It’s a story about enlightenment, about letting go and giving in, about self acceptance, about fighting ego, about what happens when you get to the TOP. It’s a story that asks “can you ever really get to the top?” and “what IS the top anyway?” </p>
<h3>So...What Do You Need From <i>My </i>Life?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Support (in the form of money). Have you ever had a friend email you a link to their independent film or video they put their heart &amp; soul into but when you click on the link your heart sinks because it sounds and looks like it was shot on a first generation iPhone inside a garbage compactor? I REALLY care about the quality of my pilot <i>Top Dog</i> and I want to be taken seriously as an independent content creator. </p>
<p>I shot 90% of the pilot using my own money I made bartending in a job I despise. But alas, I am now broke and am putting my pride aside to ask for help. In order to finish my pilot I need to shoot an elaborate opening scene which will require a budget for the following things. </p>
<p>CREW (a professional Cinematographer, A professional Sound Operator, Camera Assistants, Productions Assistants, Etc.)</p>
<p>Locations, Lenses, Actors</p>
<p>Post Production</p>
<h3>WHO the heck are you?</h3>
<p>ulia Tokarz is a New York based actress, writer, director, &amp; dog lover who has a BFA in Acting from LIU CW Post. Julia can be seen opposite comedian Chris D’Elia as his quirky assistant, Patty, in Heather Graham’s comedy Half Magic. Some of her other acting credits include The Last OG (TBS), Inside Amy Schumer (Comedy Central), Blue Bloods (CBS), &amp; The Following (FOX). You may also have seen her with Amy Poehler in the feature film Sisters ....oh wait, no, her scene was cut out of that movie. </p>
<p>Julia got her start in comedy training at UCB-NY from 2008-2012. The award winning comedy webseries she wrote &amp; starred in, It's Not Okay, Cupid! has screened at festivals across the country and was featured in Backstage Magazine. She also created a series of YouTube sketches about millennials which won no awards. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Does This Project Matter?</h3>
<p>This story was born out of my own frustrations and blocks with being a plus sized actress who has a desire to change the world. I often find myself struggling with the questions “what is my purpose in this life?” and “what am I doing that matters?” I believe everyone has asked themselves these questions at some point in their life. Whether they’re pursuing their true passions and dreams or they’re stuck behind a desk working a job they detest- it is a universal human truth to seek what Joseph Campbell called the “rapture of being alive”. Our hearts know to listen to those whispers from The Universe(you know, the ones Oprah talks about)- but how often do we actually hear them? And how many of us have the courage to act when we do? Katie McKenna’s bravery to follow the scent in a new direction is thrilling and compelling to an audience.</p>
<p>I also want to tell the story of a woman with a non-conventional body in a way that doesn’t revolve around her weight or her struggles accepting her own body. Women of all body types are sexual beings. I feel their stories should be represented in media without having to focus on their struggles with their body or sexuality. </p>
<p>Social Media has opened a Pandora’s Box that gives people too much access and zero direction. Our lives are bombarded with meaningless likes and posts and our souls ache for something real. Just as the reign of The Kardashians ushered in a generation of people who were “famous just for being famous”, Social Media has spawned their animal equivalents. In recent years dog have become some of the most profitable influencers on social media. Clawing their way to the top of elite social circles of money and fame. I aim to ask: Are Dog Stars and the world surrounding their fame any different from their Hollywood human equivalent? And what happens when a person with a conscious is introduced to this business?</p>
<p>And...I LOVE DOGS! WHO DOESN’T? </p>

Have you ever had a friend email you a link to their independent film or video they put their heart & soul into but when you click on the link your heart sinks because it sounds and looks like it was shot on a first generation iPhone inside a garbage compactor? I REALLY care about the quality of my pilot Top Dog and I want to be taken seriously as an independent content creator. 
I shot 90% of the pilot using my own money I made bartending in a job I despise. But alas, I am now broke and am putting my pride aside to ask for help. In order to finish my pilot I need to shoot an elaborate opening scene which will require a budget for the following things.

WHO the heck are you?
ulia Tokarz is a New York based actress, writer, director, & dog lover who has a BFA in Acting from LIU CW Post. Julia can be seen opposite comedian Chris D’Elia as his quirky assistant, Patty, in Heather Graham’s comedy Half Magic. Some of her other acting credits include The Last OG (TBS), Inside Amy Schumer (Comedy Central), Blue Bloods (CBS), & The Following (FOX). You may also have seen her with Amy Poehler in the feature film Sisters ....oh wait, no, her scene was cut out of that movie. 
Julia got her start in comedy training at UCB-NY from 2008-2012. The award winning comedy webseries she wrote & starred in, It's Not Okay, Cupid! has screened at festivals across the country and was featured in Backstage Magazine. She also created a series of YouTube sketches about millennials which won no awards. 

Why Does This Project Matter?
This story was born out of my own frustrations and blocks with being a plus sized actress who has a desire to change the world. I often find myself struggling with the questions “what is my purpose in this life?” and “what am I doing that matters?” I believe everyone has asked themselves these questions at some point in their life. Whether they’re pursuing their true passions and dreams or they’re stuck behind a desk working a job they detest- it is a universal human truth to seek what Joseph Campbell called the “rapture of being alive”. Our hearts know to listen to those whispers from The Universe(you know, the ones Oprah talks about)- but how often do we actually hear them? And how many of us have the courage to act when we do? Katie McKenna’s bravery to follow the scent in a new direction is thrilling and compelling to an audience.
I also want to tell the story of a woman with a non-conventional body in a way that doesn’t revolve around her weight or her struggles accepting her own body. Women of all body types are sexual beings. I feel their stories should be represented in media without having to focus on their struggles with their body or sexuality. 
Social Media has opened a Pandora’s Box that gives people too much access and zero direction. Our lives are bombarded with meaningless likes and posts and our souls ache for something real. Just as the reign of The Kardashians ushered in a generation of people who were “famous just for being famous”, Social Media has spawned their animal equivalents. In recent years dog have become some of the most profitable influencers on social media. Clawing their way to the top of elite social circles of money and fame. I aim to ask: Are Dog Stars and the world surrounding their fame any different from their Hollywood human equivalent? And what happens when a person with a conscious is introduced to this business?
And...I LOVE DOGS! WHO DOESN’T?

<h2>The Film</h2>
<p><i>54 Blocks</i> is a short, ten minute mockumentary following Tim Wilson and Danielle 'Daz' Brookes, two competitors in the sport of Mouth Jenga. Mouth Jenga is a fictitious sport where players play giant Jenga, but using only their mouths and greater facial regions to remove blocks.

<p>RICOCHET is a feature length film about the tragic death of Kate Steinle. Kate was walking on Pier 14 in San Francisco with her father when a shot rang out. Seconds later, she was dead. An undocumented immigrant, Jose Garcia Zarate, was arrested and accused of murder. Within hours, then candidate Donald Trump used the case to justify his immigration policies, stating that the death of Steinle was caused by San Francisco's sanctuary city policies.  The trial of the case was one of the most watched and commented on trials of decade .</p>
<p>Matt Gonzalez, Chief Attorney of the San Francisco Public Defender's Office, is assigned the case and develops the evidence through a fascinating analysis of video evidence, forensic science and witnesses, including Garcia-Zarate.   Gonzalez is assisted by Francisco Ugarte, who heads the office's immigration unit, and the defense team.</p>

<p>Shane, his younger brother Ben, and his friends Keith and McKayla are trapped. They're trapped not only in the cycle of poverty, but also a town that's decaying around them.

<p><br/>With this film, we want to explore the extent to which the our environment shapes who we become. For too many, it's the inescapability of toxic circumstances that breed desperate and irrational action. In the case of our characters, their plan to steal an ATM isn't rooted in some sort of inherent evil or wrongness. Rather, it's the result of a desperate escapist fantasy that has left them detached from reality and rationality. <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538019546/xzywqyy4e78f7epajiby.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Filmmaking is an expensive and exhausting process, even for the most passionate of creators. While we will be receiving camera and sound equipment from one of the top film institutions in the nation,  a film this special still requires a large number of other costs.<br/><br/>Authenticity of the environment is essential. Investing our budget in the right costuming, set design, and location rentals is integral to telling an honest and impactful story. Because this film takes place in rural communities, we will be leaving Chicago and shooting in trailer parks and motels across Illinois and Indiana. Additionally, we will be working with a cast and crew of over 30 dedicated (unpaid) volunteers.

They're trapped not only in the cycle of poverty, but also a town that's decaying around them. The circumstances of their environment become so suffocating, that it drives them to a very desperate plan: steal an ATM from a local motel, divide up the cash, and get out while they can.

With this film, we want to explore the extent to which the our environment shapes who we become. For too many, it's the inescapability of toxic circumstances that breed desperate and irrational action. In the case of our characters, their plan to steal an ATM isn't rooted in some sort of inherent evil or wrongness. Rather, it's the result of a desperate escapist fantasy that has left them detached from reality and rationality. 




Our official aim is $4,000, the minimum needed to bring An American Parable to life. 
Filmmaking is an expensive and exhausting process, even for the most passionate of creators. While we will be receiving camera and sound equipment from one of the top film institutions in the nation,  a film this special still requires a large number of other costs.Authenticity of the environment is essential. Investing our budget in the right costuming, set design, and location rentals is integral to telling an honest and impactful story. Because this film takes place in rural communities, we will be leaving Chicago and shooting in trailer parks and motels across Illinois and Indiana. Additionally, we will be working with a cast and crew of over 30 dedicated (unpaid) volunteers.

<p>“Why do you go away? So that you can come back. So that you can see the place you came from with new eyes and extra colours. And the people there see you differently, too. Coming back to where you started is not the same as never leaving.” Terry Pratchett, A Hat Full of Sky</p>

<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<p>Filming is cheaper than it's ever been, but some things are still expensive. About 50% of Proper Charlie is set on a boat, and we need to use a special set and have crew experienced on these kind of shoots. The boat is an important part of the story.</p>
<p>I'm raising funds to do a test shoot. I need to scope out the location and the boat, and produce a sizzle reel to show the look and feel of the feature. </p>
<p>I need 9k to do it properly. This will enable me to then attach a great character actor, and help to  raise the rest of the production costs, which is  around 1M.  </p>
<p>I have experience of making a feature film- Nine Nights, and bringing it in on time and on budget. </p>
<p>You can find out more about Nine Nights here - <a href=""http://www.ninenightsfilm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ninenightsfilm.com</a>. It is due to be distributed late 2020 on all platforms worldwide. It also won a major award. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about and to people they trust. Here are some things to do in this section:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are Isaiah and Aaron, the co-creators of an award-winning short film Frank and Us that has been receiving an amazing amount of attention on short content streaming channels. </li>
<li>The viewers have spoken and WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO BRING CHAPTER 2 TO LIFE! We're thrilled by the responses and overly excited to jump back into this world that we took a year to create. </li>
<li>Frank and Us is the story of a drifter who, after losing his family to a near apocalyptic alien invasion, takes solace in an abandoned town. At the peak of Frank going stir crazy, he's visited by other drifters that turn his world upside down. Chapter 2 dives right into the wasteland like world and explores Frank's incapability of living with others as he travels the desolate desert for his friend Sam. The action starts right away with an up close interaction with the aliens, after that Frank has to defend a weak family from a pack of blood-thirty raiders who depict the true cruelty that the world has become. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>We've wanted to make this film the second we finished the first film but like most indie artists, we ran out of money. However, that didn't stop us from writing and creating the world Frank lives in. We honed in on a 12 part TV series that we're currently shopping around the industry. With the current condition of the film industry and the impact the pandemic is having on it, TV series are getting stuck in creative purgatory so we said... ""screw this"" let's do it ourselves and have some fun and let's bring other creatives or post-apoc enthusiasts along on the ride. Your contribution means the world to us because we'll finally be able to create the world we've been dreaming about for almost 2 years now. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We're looking for $4500 to revamp this film. Some might say... but that's nothing? It's not much but we don't need full funding of the film which will end up being $10K, we're going to cover half on our own but we do need help with the rest. We need this money to permit our shoot at a desert location, production design, produce an alien costume, attach a professional make-up artist so that it doesn't look campy. </li>
<li>What type of perks do you get from your investment?<ul>
<li>$10 gets you a shout out on our social medias. We're not influencers or anything but we do have a tight crew of people that love to see other people helping other artists so hey maybe your shout out will attract someone to welcome you onto another project. </li>
<li>$25 gets you a poster</li>
<li>$50 - Early access to watching the film. If we do an intimate screening YOU'RE INVITED. Trust us... it'll be one hell of a night. </li>
<li>$100 gets you a Frank and Us T-Shirt</li>
<li>$200 lands you an associate producer title in the credits and on IMDB</li>
<li>$500 Mike Ferguson himself is going to give you a personal TATTOO</li>
<li>$750 lands you a scene in the film where Mike kills you. And you get one line of dialogue. This is only open to one person for obvious reasons haha. </li>
<li>$1000 gets you the big Executive Producer credit</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fortunately we keep our crew very tight so it'll be a skeleton operation but we still need to adhere to Covid protocols for everyones safety. That means testing beforehand, hiring a safety monitor, building cleaning stations, and providing hand sanitizers. </li>
<li>And of course with having a small crew comes people wearing multiple hats. The director will more than likely be the script supervisor, the gaffer and damn... possibly the back-up safety coordinator. That's okay though, we've done this before and sometimes creating a team-building environment is one of the best takeaways from shooting a film. </li>

<br/>El Proyecto Essentia</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><br/>Essential es un documental sobre la musica electrónica en Sudamérica, más precisamente Perú, Chile, Argentina y Uruguay pensado, realizado y conceptualizado por Marilou Vallès y Rodrigo Posada. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">El proyecto nace en Lima en 2016 de nuestra curiosidad a aprender más sobre el movimiento de la escena en el continente. Después de haber documentado durante unos años la escena peruana con nuestra revista online Datexeus, quisimos ampliar el espectro hacía el continente para entender más y mejor la efervescencia de estas diferentes escenas. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">En diciembre 2017 partimos con 2 cámaras, una Kombi VW para un viaje de dos años y medio de rodaje. Atravesamos Peru, Chile, Argentina y Uruguay. Invertimos todos nuestros ahorros para realizar este sueño. En 2 años y medio, realizamos más de 60 entrevistas en más de 10 ciudades. <br/> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597672002/pzpcghv3pu8pw8uyoqsl.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nuestra meta principal fue salir a conocer a la gente involucrada en la escena más independiente de esas diferentes ciudades : Lima y Cuzco (Perú), Arica, Iquique, Valparaiso, Santiago, Concepción y Puerto Montt (Chile), Rosario y Buenos Aires (Argentina) &amp; Montevideo (Uruguay). Djs, productores, promotores, dueños de locales, organizadores de festivales y eventos. Personas y sus iniciativas nacidas por puro amor al arte y a la música. Nuestra intención fue presentar retratos de personas de diferentes generaciones y ámbitos musicales para dar de conocer un espéctro lo más amplio posible así como armar diálogos sobre diferentes temáticas. Descubrimos problemáticas pero también filosofías propias a cada país y de cada entrevista salíamos con más preguntas y inquietudes. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Lo mas bonito de esta aventura fue de lejos el aspecto humano y su riqueza. Compartir con gente maravillosa que siempre nos recibieron con pura buena vibra en su ciudad, casa o estudio y gracias a quién nos sentimos cada día más apoyados y legítimos a emprender esta búsqueda. Descubrimos ciudades hirviendo de música, arte, lucha, cultura y contracultura.  Experimentamos también la música electrónica en su versión más pura, independiente y rebelde, más política. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Una cultura alternativa que responde a un sistema que todavía la estigmatiza demasiado. Una lucha perpetua para hacer reconocer su arte como cultura y no solamente como un entretenimiento. <br/> </p>

<h3>
<br/>Sinopsis<br/> </h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Essentia se inspira en la búsqueda por conocer las escenas de la música electrónica independiente en el Perú, Chile, Uruguay y Argentina encontrándose con distintas perspectivas en cuanto a las motivaciones de gestionar cultura,  dejando en común en todas ellas;  el aspecto comunitario de entablar relaciones entre personas  que quieren vivir en una sociedad mejor.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Y es la música un estímulo para el alma que funciona como un motor para esas comunidades en su lado más puro,  gestando el desarrollo de nuevos espacios de expresión cultural, la cual, en muchos casos está cargada de connotaciones políticas que van en contra  de los esquemas establecidos y de la mercantilizada industria musical.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Este documental propone discusiones y diferentes enfoques sobre el artista, su relación con la música y su convivencia con el parámetro comercial. Invita a cuestionarnos cómo el arte puede subsistir mediante intereses económicos, manteniendo su carácter auténtico / subjetivo sin que este se diluya en el tiempo o se vea sacrificado por lo primero.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">¿Se debe estar sujetos a las tendencias musicales impuestas por la industria para el desarrollo de producciones, o se debe apostar por el fuego, intuitivo y creativo del artista?¿Qué relación guardan las escenas de éstos países entre ellas?  ¿Cómo hacer valorar éste movimiento para que adquiera características más culturales y que deje de ser visto como medio de mero entretenimiento?</p>

<h3>
<br/>Dónde estamos y lo que necesitamos</h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Auto producimos todo el proceso y asumimos todos los gastos que representaron esos años en la carretera. Ahora, estamos en el hermoso proceso de editarlo y estamos en la fase final. Tenemos muchas ganas de poder compartir todo esta enseñanza con el publico. Mariano, un gran DJ de Rosario, Argentina, nos decía que para él hacer discos es como hacerle un regalo a la música, una retribución a todo lo bonito que nos da en la vida. Nos parece una manera muy bonita de ver la cosa, y pensamos igual para el documental. Dejar algo concreto, un objeto visual y sonoro, un regalo para la escena.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Si lees estas palabras hoy, es que necesitamos su apoyo para finalizar este proyecto.  Los fondos que podremos recaudar por este medio nos ayudaran a asumir los gastos de :</p>
<ul>
<li><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Post-producción : Mezcla de sonido profesional, etalonnage, motion graphic y subtítulos.</p></li>
<li><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Promoción : Operación de promoción digital, fees de presentación a festivales, viajes para asistir a presentaciones y proyecciones. </p></li>
<li><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Producción de los DVDs y de la banda original en formato Vinilo y CD. </p></li>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Essentia project</span></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><br/>Essential is a documentary about electronic music in South America, more precisely Peru, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay made and conceptualized by Marilou Vallès and Rodrigo Posada.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The project was born in Lima in 2016 from our curiosity to learn more about the movement of the scene in the continent. After having documented the Peruvian scene for a few years with our online magazine Datexeus, we wanted to broaden the spectrum towards the continent to understand more and better the effervescence of these different scenes.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">In December 2017 we left with 2 cameras, a VW Kombi for a trip of two and a half years of shooting. We go through Peru, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay. We invested all of our savings to realize this dream. In 2 and a half years, we conducted more than 60 interviews in more than 10 cities.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Our main goal was to get to know the people involved in the most independent scene in these different cities: Lima and Cuzco (Peru), Arica, Iquique, Valparaiso, Santiago, Concepción and Puerto Montt (Chile), Rosario and Buenos Aires (Argentina) &amp; Montevideo, Uruguay). Djs, producers, promoters, venue owners, festival and event organizers. People and their initiatives born out of pure love of art and music. Our intention was to present portraits of people of different generations and musical fields to make a spectrum as wide as possible known as well as to put together dialogues on different topics. We discovered problems but also philosophies specific to each country and from each interview we came out with more questions and concerns.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The most beautiful thing about this adventure was by far the human aspect and its wealth. Share with wonderful people who always received us with pure good vibes in their city, home or studio and thanks to whom we feel more supported and legitimate every day to undertake this search.

El Proyecto Essentia
Essential es un documental sobre la musica electrónica en Sudamérica, más precisamente Perú, Chile, Argentina y Uruguay pensado, realizado y conceptualizado por Marilou Vallès y Rodrigo Posada. 
El proyecto nace en Lima en 2016 de nuestra curiosidad a aprender más sobre el movimiento de la escena en el continente. Después de haber documentado durante unos años la escena peruana con nuestra revista online Datexeus, quisimos ampliar el espectro hacía el continente para entender más y mejor la efervescencia de estas diferentes escenas. 
En diciembre 2017 partimos con 2 cámaras, una Kombi VW para un viaje de dos años y medio de rodaje. Atravesamos Peru, Chile, Argentina y Uruguay. Invertimos todos nuestros ahorros para realizar este sueño. En 2 años y medio, realizamos más de 60 entrevistas en más de 10 ciudades.  
 
 
 
Nuestra meta principal fue salir a conocer a la gente involucrada en la escena más independiente de esas diferentes ciudades : Lima y Cuzco (Perú), Arica, Iquique, Valparaiso, Santiago, Concepción y Puerto Montt (Chile), Rosario y Buenos Aires (Argentina) & Montevideo (Uruguay). Djs, productores, promotores, dueños de locales, organizadores de festivales y eventos. Personas y sus iniciativas nacidas por puro amor al arte y a la música. Nuestra intención fue presentar retratos de personas de diferentes generaciones y ámbitos musicales para dar de conocer un espéctro lo más amplio posible así como armar diálogos sobre diferentes temáticas. Descubrimos problemáticas pero también filosofías propias a cada país y de cada entrevista salíamos con más preguntas y inquietudes. 
Lo mas bonito de esta aventura fue de lejos el aspecto humano y su riqueza. Compartir con gente maravillosa que siempre nos recibieron con pura buena vibra en su ciudad, casa o estudio y gracias a quién nos sentimos cada día más apoyados y legítimos a emprender esta búsqueda. Descubrimos ciudades hirviendo de música, arte, lucha, cultura y contracultura.  Experimentamos también la música electrónica en su versión más pura, independiente y rebelde, más política. 
Una cultura alternativa que responde a un sistema que todavía la estigmatiza demasiado. Una lucha perpetua para hacer reconocer su arte como cultura y no solamente como un entretenimiento.  


Sinopsis 
Essentia se inspira en la búsqueda por conocer las escenas de la música electrónica independiente en el Perú, Chile, Uruguay y Argentina encontrándose con distintas perspectivas en cuanto a las motivaciones de gestionar cultura,  dejando en común en todas ellas;  el aspecto comunitario de entablar relaciones entre personas  que quieren vivir en una sociedad mejor.
Y es la música un estímulo para el alma que funciona como un motor para esas comunidades en su lado más puro,  gestando el desarrollo de nuevos espacios de expresión cultural, la cual, en muchos casos está cargada de connotaciones políticas que van en contra  de los esquemas establecidos y de la mercantilizada industria musical.
Este documental propone discusiones y diferentes enfoques sobre el artista, su relación con la música y su convivencia con el parámetro comercial. Invita a cuestionarnos cómo el arte puede subsistir mediante intereses económicos, manteniendo su carácter auténtico / subjetivo sin que este se diluya en el tiempo o se vea sacrificado por lo primero.
¿Se debe estar sujetos a las tendencias musicales impuestas por la industria para el desarrollo de producciones, o se debe apostar por el fuego, intuitivo y creativo del artista?¿Qué relación guardan las escenas de éstos países entre ellas?  ¿Cómo hacer valorar éste movimiento para que adquiera características más culturales y que deje de ser visto como medio de mero entretenimiento?



Dónde estamos y lo que necesitamos
 
Auto producimos todo el proceso y asumimos todos los gastos que representaron esos años en la carretera. Ahora, estamos en el hermoso proceso de editarlo y estamos en la fase final. Tenemos muchas ganas de poder compartir todo esta enseñanza con el publico. Mariano, un gran DJ de Rosario, Argentina, nos decía que para él hacer discos es como hacerle un regalo a la música, una retribución a todo lo bonito que nos da en la vida. Nos parece una manera muy bonita de ver la cosa, y pensamos igual para el documental. Dejar algo concreto, un objeto visual y sonoro, un regalo para la escena.
Si lees estas palabras hoy, es que necesitamos su apoyo para finalizar este proyecto.  Los fondos que podremos recaudar por este medio nos ayudaran a asumir los gastos de :

Post-producción : Mezcla de sonido profesional, etalonnage, motion graphic y subtítulos.
Promoción : Operación de promoción digital, fees de presentación a festivales, viajes para asistir a presentaciones y proyecciones. 
Producción de los DVDs y de la banda original en formato Vinilo y CD. 

 

Otras maneras en cuales puedes apoyar el proyecto
 
Estamos consciente que no todos podemos apoyar de la misma manera, pero si te gustó el proyecto, compartirlo, hablar de ello a tus amigos o artistas que podrían ser interesados...  Es gratis y puede hacer mucho! :)http://www.facebook.com/EssentiaDocumentaryhttp://www.instagram.com/EssentiaDocumentary

Essentia project
Essential is a documentary about electronic music in South America, more precisely Peru, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay made and conceptualized by Marilou Vallès and Rodrigo Posada.
The project was born in Lima in 2016 from our curiosity to learn more about the movement of the scene in the continent. After having documented the Peruvian scene for a few years with our online magazine Datexeus, we wanted to broaden the spectrum towards the continent to understand more and better the effervescence of these different scenes.
In December 2017 we left with 2 cameras, a VW Kombi for a trip of two and a half years of shooting. We go through Peru, Chile, Argentina and Uruguay. We invested all of our savings to realize this dream. In 2 and a half years, we conducted more than 60 interviews in more than 10 cities.
Our main goal was to get to know the people involved in the most independent scene in these different cities: Lima and Cuzco (Peru), Arica, Iquique, Valparaiso, Santiago, Concepción and Puerto Montt (Chile), Rosario and Buenos Aires (Argentina) & Montevideo, Uruguay). Djs, producers, promoters, venue owners, festival and event organizers. People and their initiatives born out of pure love of art and music. Our intention was to present portraits of people of different generations and musical fields to make a spectrum as wide as possible known as well as to put together dialogues on different topics. We discovered problems but also philosophies specific to each country and from each interview we came out with more questions and concerns.
The most beautiful thing about this adventure was by far the human aspect and its wealth. Share with wonderful people who always received us with pure good vibes in their city, home or studio and thanks to whom we feel more supported and legitimate every day to undertake this search. We discover cities seething with music, art, struggle, culture and counterculture. We also experience electronic music in its purest, most independent and rebellious, more political version.
An alternative culture that responds to a system that still stigmatizes it too much. A perpetual struggle to make their art recognized as culture and not just as entertainment. 


Synospis 
Essentia is inspired by the search to know the scenes of independent electronic music in Peru, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina, finding different perspectives regarding the motivations of managing culture, leaving in common in all of them; the community aspect of building relationships between people who want to live in a better society.
And music is a stimulus for the soul that works as an engine for these communities in their purest side, gestating the development of new spaces for cultural expression, which, in many cases, is loaded with political connotations that go against the established schemes and the commodified music industry.
This documentary proposes discussions and different approaches about the artist, his relationship with music and his coexistence with the commercial parameter. It invites us to question how art can subsist through economic interests, maintaining its authentic / subjective character without this being diluted over time or being sacrificed for the former.
Should we be subject to the musical trends imposed by the industry for the development of productions, or should we bet on the fire, intuitive and creative of the artist? What relationship do the scenes of these countries have between them? How can this movement be valued so that it acquires more cultural characteristics and stops being seen as a means of mere entertainment?
 
Where we are and what we need
We self-produced the whole process and we assumed all the expenses that those years on the road represented. Now, we are in the beautiful process of editing it and we are in the final phase. We really want to share all this teaching with the public. Mariano, a great DJ from Rosario, Argentina, told us that for him making records is like giving music a gift, a reward for all the beauty that it gives us in life. It seems like a very nice way of looking at it, and we think the same for the documentary. Leave something concrete, a visual and sound object, a gift for the scene.
If you read these words today, it is because we need your support to finish this project. The funds that we can collect through this means will help us to assume the expenses of:

Post-production: Mix of professional sound, etalonnage, motion graphic and subtitles.
Promotion: Digital promotion operation, festival presentation fees, trips to attend presentations and screenings.
Production of the DVDs and the original band in Vinyl and CD format.

<h3>Our Story Thus Far</h3>
<p>Hello there!  Thank you for checking out our campaign, we hope that you can be the difference in making this dream a reality.</p>
<p>We're a group of students/friends in Greeley, CO (Not so lovingly referred to as Cowtown). When we started working on 'Cowtown' nearly half a year ago we were filled with a lot of ambition and we still are!  However, we realized early on that we wouldn't be able to make this film without some sort of budget.   It took a long time to set that budget and this campaign in order, but now we're rearing to go!  During the course of the campaign we'll getting the last pieces in place (Filling out spaller roles, a readthrough, character work etc.).  With your help by the end of that time we'll have the finances we need to get rolling on production.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>Our Overall goal is $8000, this can be divided down to:</p>
<p>- $5000 For Camera + Lense Rental</p>
<p>- $2000 For Locations + Props</p>
<p>- $1000 For Audio + Recording Equipment</p>
<p>The real question is, what happens if we don't reach our goal?  Where does the money go?  </p>
<p>Our priorities, if we don't hit our goal, are the basics.  A camera, some sound gear, and locations.  If we have those we can make the movie.  Of course we don't WANT to do it this way.  We want to be able to create a product that does the story justice.   But, if there's no other choice, we'll make do.  </p>
<h3>Why Cowtown?</h3>
<p>3 Reasons:</p>
<p>1.  Cowtown is a fresh take on the classic, high school, coming of age story.  While the film takes place in a gritty reality, there is always a scent of the mystical in the air.  Cowtown isn't quite what it seems.</p>
<p>2.  The film deals with topics of classism, homophobia, and alienation.  Overall it has a lot to say about the world as it is now.</p>
<p>3.  The incredible talent on board!  Every actor is perfect for their role and the people behind the scenes are all future masters of their craft.  I (Nik Blatt the Writer/Director of the film) do not say this lightly.</p>

<p>As an anxious, but low-maintenance child, 7-year-old Charlie finds herself caught in the crossfire of a parental war zone. Due to her mom being a cam girl and father clutching onto his insecurities, she finds it hard to see where she is standing in such a big world. With the help of the plastic flamingos flocking her front yard and a new perspective, Charlie is able to take comfort through the stress of her parent’s inevitable separation.</p>

<p><i>Pink Flamingos</i> was inspired by my time spent in my childhood home in Kentucky this past spring. It was the start of the pandemic and things honestly felt hopeless. I never thought when I left for college I would be right back in my room thats walls aged alongside me. I decided to go for a bike ride in my neighborhood and it was a few streets up that I saw it- a little girl playing hopscotch in front of her house. Her mom was on the porch talking into her cellphone clearly distraught. Yet, the girl was in her own world, unphased by everything that surrounded her. This visual sparked an interest to explore what truly goes on both from inside and outside a family's home. As I continued to peddle up the street, I saw a neighbor's front lawn filled with these godly pink plastic flamingos... and the story started to form from there.</p>

With your contribution, we will be able to provide our crew with the right materials and equipment to achieve our desired vision.

<p><i>Pink Flamingos</i> calls attention to mental health and anxiety from the early stages of childhood. A topic as important as this has rarely been explored from a child’s perspective on screen. Our hopes in sharing Charlie’s story is to open up a conversation of how an unhealthy environment and disproportionate levels of stress can affect one’s mental health later in life. We aim to show that there is hope during a time when life feels like it is shifting under our feet, even in the most unexpected places. We are grateful for your support and aid in this ambitious project, and look forward to delivering a film that speaks volumes to young children struggling with mental health everywhere.</p>

<p>When writing <i>Pink Flamingos</i>, I wanted to emphasize knowing when to lean on someone, even when you want to keep them at arm's length. Life can surprise you, especially with the people who stick around to witness it with you. As someone who has struggled with anxiety and has seen the repercussions of it, I know in my heart this is a story I need to tell. My hopes are to open up a discussion with the viewers on this topic and to establish a female voice in a male dominant industry. I can’t stress how delighted I am with the team I have assembled. It is because of their same passion and drive for this project, that I know we can produce a worthwhile film. Thank you again for your contribution, we appreciate your time and consideration.

</div></div>","Introduction
Hello! 
I am Matthew Quek, a Singaporean singer-songwriter, executive movie producer, actor, Special Education Needs (SEN) Counsellor and Educator.
I have invisible Special Education Needs (SEN) which were only diagnosed during my National Service after going through much trauma, isolation and discrimination throughout much of my school life.
 
Short Film Project: ""The Prism""
“You have the ability to adjust the lens through which you view the world.” ― Jeffrey G. Duarte
We aim to produce a meaningful and impactful short film entitled ""The Prism"", and we appeal for your support to realise this project.
This film, which I am involved in on a strictly personal capacity, will be based on a first-person portrayal of the life of an individual with autism/ASD/Asperger's and multiple special needs living during the COVID-19 lockdown phase, featuring especially, the struggles his caregivers face in the midst of unemployment, retrenchment, discrimination and mental health challenges.
Although largely fictitious in nature, it will be based on real-life accounts of such individuals.
 
What We Need 
This film project has already been officially supported and granted partial funding by MCCY (Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth) via the OSF (Our Singapore Fund) and SG Enable. We are immensely thankful for their support and endorsement.
However, in order to realise this vision, we need to raise additional funds for the project.
We hope to produce and release this movie during the second half of 2021 as we would like to bring greater awareness to the difficult reality of those living with such challenges daily via the Purple Parade 2021 in October.
 
Achieving the Vision with YOUR Help
We hope to inspire children and youths with SEN to invest their efforts and time to produce and showcase their artistic works and areas of talent.
Our desire is to see children and youths with SEN meaningfully integrated into Singaporean society, whether at school, work or play.
Through this project and your kind financial support, we hope to be ambassadors for those who need a voice and have flown under the radar in our society for a long time.
This project is intended to be a springboard from which others may step up as fellow ambassadors for those who may face similar challenges, and feel isolated and discouraged in our society.
Together, we aim to play our part in a collective effort of ensuring that future generations of Singaporeans would be able to truly enjoy being immersed in a genuinely-inclusive nation. 
 
Additional Information
“It takes a village to raise a child”, it is often said, but it takes a lot more for those with special needs.
Nonetheless, with the right hearts of love, empathy, kindness, compassion and perseverance, the most daunting of odds can be overcome together.
Life can be meaningful and purposeful because of the right hearts, right people and right platforms working towards the same goal of genuine inclusivity.
This film and corresponding theme song could be used by various Special Education Organisations as a tool to enable special needs individuals to healthily integrate into school life, work life and other aspects of social interaction without an unhealthy fear of bullying, rejection and discrimination. This will complement the country’s efforts to rise above this crisis and galvanise one another for collective recovery and hope for the future.
This work will subtly highlight the recent initiatives of Skills Future, re-skilling and employment, in tandem with community togetherness in forging a social glue that will ensure that we, as a nation and society, arise from this crisis stronger, empathetic and much more resilient.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi family, friends, and people here out of boredom and curiosity!</p>
<p>Some of you may know me from North Carolina, some of you from California, but all of you probably know that I've been living in LA for awhile now... rolling the dice on a chance to do what I love for a living. It's been quite the interesting journey so far, and yet, it's still just the beginning!</p>
<p>This summer, I'm finally embarking on making my first short film since my senior thesis in college. 'Without A Doubt' is a lighthearted comedy set in the early 2000's, and it's a project that means a lot to me. However, it takes a lot of blood, sweat, and tears to film something independently yet professionally, which I'll explain more below, but I could really use your help! </p>
<p>My hope is that this film conveys the idea that young girls should not be afraid to take control of their own destiny and go after what they deserve... and also makes you laugh along the way! If this is a message/endeavor you can get behind, I would greatly appreciate your support. Any amount helps!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Allow me to introduce you to our CREW!</p>
<p>In the spirit of the film... here's the photos of the crew NOW &amp; THEN. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If you're not in the film industry, you may not know that making a short film (especially in LA) is quite the daunting challenge. You've got to find strong crew, talented actors, FEED them (at the bare minimum), rent expensive camera packages and lighting equipment, secure believable locations, buy ample set design, and so on. That's why the budgets on all your favorite movies are millions of dollars and the credits are SO long. </p>
<p>We are but a humble indie short film, though, so while we don't need millions of dollars... the costs do add up. Here are some of the things we'll be putting the money towards:</p>
<p>- Renting a camera package, lighting equipment, and sound equipment</p>
<p>- Feeding our cast and crew healthy and filling meals who are volunteering their precious time</p>
<p>- Buying set dressing, props, and costumes to make the scene feel as real and accurate as possible</p>
<p>- Music license fees for 2000's specific songs</p>
<p>- Entry fees for film festivals around the country that allow the finished product to be seen and enjoyed on the big screen</p>
<p>Plus all of the little things speed bumps that cost money along the way!</p>

<h2>How we came to this project.</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556464134/fiu4ecf319egqseftsnb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Writer/Director Jeff Verlanic is passionate about his family's roots in rural Montana and the often overlooked queer communities of the American west.</strong> For the last five years he has been pursuing an MFA with New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and this project is his thesis - the culmination of years spent studying with professors like Spike Lee, Eliza Hittman, Todd Solondz, and numerous others. </p>
<p>While working at 57th Street Books on the South Side of Chicago to support his work as an improviser at Second City and improvOlympic, Jeff came across Mary MacLane's memoirs and couldn't believe they hadn't been adapted. The strength of her voice and the unbelievable story of a radical woman living in rural Montana at the end of the 19th century stuck with him. <strong>Ten years later, he is finally realizing the dream of turning this brilliant text into a film.</strong></p>
<h2>How far along is the film?</h2>
<p><strong>We have shot 20 rolls of 16mm film and are eager to start editing - supporting this project means bringing it into existence.</strong> It may be in the can but we still have so much left to do. Post production is really when a movie comes to life: processing with Fotokem in Los Angeles, editing, and distributing are all expensive steps ahead and every donation helps to finish and release this beautiful project. <strong>This film is urgent</strong> - it tells the story of a resilient woman trapped within her experiences of internalized sexism. <strong>The ruins of the ghost town reflect her isolation. Trapped inside of herself she turns to her writing but cannot escape the torments of sexism and homophobia.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556465737/qolu4xd2lcqdpzn0a2qr.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>NYU generously provides financial support for thesis work but their allotment barely covers even the most basic production costs. The cast and crew have all worked for well below their normal rates out of love for this project. Everyone involved can't wait to share the short with the world, however, finishing a film is expensive - we need money to pay our composer, for sound editing, music recording, film processing, color-grading, festival submissions, musicians etc...</p>
<p><font>We are focused on the ways in which this project bridges the gap between Montana and New York City. Our perks reflect the important role played by each of these communities.</font></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Why is this important?</h2>
<h3>Trust Your Visions</h3>
<p><strong>Women of the 19th century weren't allowed to have strong opinions</strong>, let alone to write radical memoirs challenging the status quo, or leave the house without a corset, but Mary stood against the conservative culture surrounding her only to find her best-selling book banned. We are still not as far along in the fight for equity surrounding gender and sexual orientation as we should be but our team believes <strong>stories like this help to inspire as the fight for equality and freedom of expression continues.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556466077/prdzyxmmm62gyxbxmpzi.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>The queer movement has the ability to reshape the world in powerful ways.</strong>  'I Await the Devil's Coming' is a further exploration of the blending of surrealist fantasia and historical activism. After screening at festivals around the US with previous projects this creative team believes 'I Await the Devil's Coming' has a more global reach, as we finish the film our goal is to have a festival run all over the world and we can't wait to have you get more involved. </p>

</div></div>","How we came to this project.

Writer/Director Jeff Verlanic is passionate about his family's roots in rural Montana and the often overlooked queer communities of the American west. For the last five years he has been pursuing an MFA with New York University's Tisch School of the Arts and this project is his thesis - the culmination of years spent studying with professors like Spike Lee, Eliza Hittman, Todd Solondz, and numerous others. 
While working at 57th Street Books on the South Side of Chicago to support his work as an improviser at Second City and improvOlympic, Jeff came across Mary MacLane's memoirs and couldn't believe they hadn't been adapted. The strength of her voice and the unbelievable story of a radical woman living in rural Montana at the end of the 19th century stuck with him. Ten years later, he is finally realizing the dream of turning this brilliant text into a film.
How far along is the film?
We have shot 20 rolls of 16mm film and are eager to start editing - supporting this project means bringing it into existence. It may be in the can but we still have so much left to do. Post production is really when a movie comes to life: processing with Fotokem in Los Angeles, editing, and distributing are all expensive steps ahead and every donation helps to finish and release this beautiful project. This film is urgent - it tells the story of a resilient woman trapped within her experiences of internalized sexism. The ruins of the ghost town reflect her isolation. Trapped inside of herself she turns to her writing but cannot escape the torments of sexism and homophobia.

NYU generously provides financial support for thesis work but their allotment barely covers even the most basic production costs. The cast and crew have all worked for well below their normal rates out of love for this project. Everyone involved can't wait to share the short with the world, however, finishing a film is expensive - we need money to pay our composer, for sound editing, music recording, film processing, color-grading, festival submissions, musicians etc...
We are focused on the ways in which this project bridges the gap between Montana and New York City. Our perks reflect the important role played by each of these communities.
 

Why is this important?
Trust Your Visions
Women of the 19th century weren't allowed to have strong opinions, let alone to write radical memoirs challenging the status quo, or leave the house without a corset, but Mary stood against the conservative culture surrounding her only to find her best-selling book banned. We are still not as far along in the fight for equity surrounding gender and sexual orientation as we should be but our team believes stories like this help to inspire as the fight for equality and freedom of expression continues.

The queer movement has the ability to reshape the world in powerful ways.  'I Await the Devil's Coming' is a further exploration of the blending of surrealist fantasia and historical activism. After screening at festivals around the US with previous projects this creative team believes 'I Await the Devil's Coming' has a more global reach, as we finish the film our goal is to have a festival run all over the world and we can't wait to have you get more involved.

<h2>Time is Running Out</h2>
<p>The plunge to extinction for Chinook salmon and Southern Resident orcas speeds up, nipping at the heels of the plodding, clumsy pace of political change in the Pacific Northwest, where dams and hydropower are king.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>Our goal of $12,000 will allow for wide reaching, impactful distribution and marketing of <i>Dammed to Extinction</i>. The only way to save the Southern Resident orcas and the salmon on which they rely is to spread the word – to tell the story of these suffering species. </p>
<p>Of course, saving orcas and Chinook is its own reward, but we want to share our appreciation of your efforts, so we've got copies of film writer Steven Hawley's <i>Recovering a Lost River </i>and some really dope t-shirts to say ""Thank You,"" to contributors like you.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Without help from folks like you, the Southern Residents and the Chinook salmon will soon perish. That means that your investment in <i>Dammed to Extinction</i> is an investment in ensuring a future for these doomed Pacific Northwest icons. Please save the orcas and the Chinook before it's too late.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Lobby your congressperson. Tell you friends. Call Washington Governor Inslee's office. </p>
<p>In short, spread the word far and wide that a majestic species of salmon and a powerful, inspirational pod of orcas is doomed if we do not remove the lower four Snake River dams and restore their natural habitats.  </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! We are Jemima and Jesimiel Damina, co-founders of a media company called Neptune3 Studios. Our official outlet is our YouTube Channel, and we post videos weekly. Growing up in the small town of Uyo, Nigeria, film has always been a combined joy of ours. We are both passionate about telling stories our generation can relate to and enjoy through the various media available to us.  After graduation, we returned to Nigeria and decided to just start something, sort of get our feet wet in Nigerian filmmaking. That something eventually became the first episode of our ongoing web series, <i>Best Friends in the World</i>, a teen-centred miniseries about friendship, family and of course, young love. </p>
<p>This campaign is so important to us because part of our vision is to impact on the minds of young people with readily available wholesome content that surrounds them with positivity and joy. With our first two episodes already over a million views each and others quickly catching up, we are convinced that we are achieving our goal.</p>
<p>We would like to conclude the series on a high note, leaving it short and sweet, but to do that we need your support. This whole time we've been self-funded and we're not able to complete our last 8 episodes as comfortably as we would like, improving the speed and quality that we have had. Your donation would go a long way to helping us attain a satisfying ending to the series, pay our cast and crew (who are 98% university students and have worked this whole time despite their school schedules and personal lives without pay).</p>
<p>If we surpass our goal, we are all ready to come back for a Best Friends in the World movie with the original cast and an exciting new adventure. The movie will be uploaded to YouTube and free for you to view on our channel.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $20,000. Making films in an unstandardized country like Nigeria costs twice as much money and energy as anywhere else. From renting equipment to transportation, hotels, feeding, makeup/wardrobe, locations, electricity (no constant power supply, so we run a generator 90% of the time), to the cast and crew, each episode is time-consuming, energy-sapping, money-sucking and yet highly rewarding thanks to the dedication of our fans. </p>
<p>If we're unable to reach our goal, we will split what we get between shooting as much as we can and compensating our amazing cast/crew for their time and dedication. If you've enjoyed these characters and their stories, please donate what you can do give them their happy ending.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you're here and you're a fan of Best Friends in the World, then we know you've taken at least one thing away from our episodes. We would like you to have closure on the series and the characters involved. No amount is too small to help us reach the finish line.</p>
<p>We already have 12 episodes (2 seasons) under our belt. We would like for you to enjoy the 3rd and final one by giving you the best stories, quality and happy cast members. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Sometimes due to weather, illnesses, faulty equipment, or just life in general, we are not able to meet our weekly uploads and you've been there with us through all of that. Sometimes we have literally had to do the impossible to get the episodes to you on time because we made a commitment to you and we intend to keep it. We hope you stick with us-- we're almost there! </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Hey, we get it. Sometimes it's bad timing and you'd really like to help but you can't. Still, you can help us by spreading the word about this campaign! Share using the Indiegogo share tools to get the word out-- someone you share to might be able to put in some money, and we appreciate every single effort.</p>
