A bit about me.
Hi I'm Josh Clarke.  In the last year I've taken up becoming a comic artist.  I've completed my first comic and am getting it self-published.  I'm now working on other comics too.


Why IndieGogo?
As I push forward in the comic world I'm going to need a lot of support.  I've seen success and received a lot of praise online with  what I've done, now I need to get it into people's hands.

The success of this campaign guarantees my work will reach the hands of those who've offered me so much support with my work over the last few months and years, and meets many new eyes as well.  


Target
Set what I beleive is a very real target of £300/$500. This will go someway towards what is needed to get my work seen by the right people in the coming months, and if I can pass my goal it'd be very much appreciated.  The money raised will go towards these costs:

Much more than the target I've set on IndieGogoso hopefully I hit or even exceed the goal.

The Good bit - what you'll get!

How much is too much?</p>
<p>The Lengths.</p>
<p>In 2007, the Arts Council funded me to conduct a research project interviewing men who sell sex to men in London. The results of the interviews have formed the basis for the comic I’ve been working on over the last couple of months.</p>
<p>The comic will tell the story of Eddie, a young man who moves to London to art school, but in his quest to find himself, he finds Nelson, a muscled prostitute who he becomes infatuated with and follows into a world of drugs and vice and then his quest for absolution once he finds that it’s a life he’s not cut out for.</p>
<p>I’m currently drawing the artwork for the first issue, but I have a story planned across eight issues that takes us through quite a ride with Eddie and his clients, lovers and friends and it’s this first issue that I’m asking for help with at the moment.</p>
<p>It’s a story I want to reach as wide an audience as possible, so I’m looking for your help to cover printing and marketing costs to help this happen as it’s an ambitious project that I believe will get a lot of attention. Once the first print run is out, I will be promoting the comic heavily and trying to secure a distribution deal for a wider release early next year.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, it’s a lot of work for one person, but it’s a labour of love for me to go down this path.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Mike Syfritt. I'm one of the founding member to the Arizona Steampunk Society. My passion is to build the coolest and most elaborate costumes I can make. I have won awards for many of my costumes and props that I have made over the last few years.</p>
<p>Just like most people I work full time and live on a fixed income so coming up with the funds to finish a new project can become quite dificult at times.</p>
<p>This new costume is no exception to what I can do. Everything I make gets better for each new challenge I take on. With the Joker i'm taking a very different route. Based on the image I posted from <a class=""u"" href=""http://odingraphics.deviantart.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">odingraphics</a> on Devient art I will be using some of the elements for his artwork and adding quite the twist.</p>
<p>The Back story for the Joker goes like this. Back in the late 1800s when Tesla and Jefferson were duking it out in the ellectric war they came up with the ellectric chair for criminals to face instead of a hanging. As this was a shure death factor they backed up their cames by statin that any criminal to survive the chair would be released to the public. Joke of course as crazy as he is survived. The process however scorthced his haed and burned off his hair. </p>
<p>So what does the Joker do? He uses the ellectrofied helmet as a hat and adds his own green flair to it. Since they didn;t want hime talking they also used the face and chin cover which I will make look like the Hanibal style face and chin gaurd but in the shape of the Jokers smile.</p>
<p>This is where you come in. I will need several expensive materials to make this happen.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will be molding Leather, Skulpting and casting parts along with having the outfit made for me. This is the most I have ever had to put into a costume before. I will need to get Scilicone and casting materials as well as fabric for my coat and pants. All this costs money that I just can't come up with in the short time I have to finish this costume.</p>
<p>I figured I can get everything I need with about $600. I'm still working on coming up with my own money so what ever I can get to help me get this finish on time would be great.</p>
<p>In return for the funding I will get each person an autographed professional photo of me in costume. I can also include for the big spenders a chance to sit in on one of the panels I will be hosting at Comicon.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The main things I will be working on with be The Electric Chair Headpiece, the Brass Flower that squrts toxic SmileX and the Tesla Cole powered hand shocker. </p>
<p>You can see some of the things I have made on my Deviant art page and Facebook.</p>

<p>I have some of the components for these items already but the one thing I need the most is Scilicone and Casting resin. I will be making the hand buzzer from clay and then making a cast of that. As you can see in the image he has copper coils inside the buzzer as well as Tesla type coils on the outside of the arm. The arm coils I will be using EL wire.</p>
<p>What this image does not show is the headpiece. It will be a traditional Electricchair headpiece but I will be adding Jokers ""Hair"" to the leather with EL wire mixed in as well. The hair is going to be Dreadlocks.</p>

<p>Most people know me as Will Franken, and for 15 years I carved out a comedy career which took me from the United States to the UK.  I've gotten excellent reviews for my work over the years, from accolades by Robin Williams to gaining the elusive 5-star review from Kate Copstick of the Scotsman for my Fringe show last year, <i>The Stuff They Put in Sleep</i>.<br/></p>
<p>This year my show is at the greatest Comedy Club in the UK- The Stand.  This is a tremendous opportunity.</p>
<p>This show still bears the hallmark
comedic traits that I have come to be known for over the years of
surrealist one-person sketches, high-speed character changes, and
politically incorrect skewering of postmodern sacred cows. The major
difference is that instead of performing as Will, I will be
performing as Sarah. <br/></p>
<p>Additionally, the first fifteen minutes of
pieces will allude, either directly or indirectly, to my
transgenderism. Even though I will be remaining in character
throughout this introit, the opening nevertheless will showcase more
honesty than I have ever revealed onstage. At least on this topic, of
which I have remained largely closeted throughout my professional
career. As a satirist in the Peter Cook/Chris Morris style and a
mimic who changes voices as frenetically as the late Robin Williams,
the fourth wall is firmly erected throughout my shows, leaving
punters often guessing as to what my true accent and my true beliefs
are. That fourth wall will still be in place for that's my creative
niche. Although through certain bits and, of course, my performance
outfit, a window will be opened – albeit briefly –  onto an
aspect of myself I had long kept hidden. Finally, though the volume
of satirical characters will remain as massive as ever, there won't
be the razzle-dazzle sound cues of last year as I am preferring to
approach this show, with the exception of my public outing, on a
simpler, grittier comedic plane. 
<br/></p>
<p><b>I had lived as a
woman briefly in San Francisco nearly fifteen years earlier for a
span of about four to five months, only putting that side of me back
in the closet when I began to get a name as the comedian Will
Franken. I was more obsessed with my career at that point and felt
being out as a transgender would limit me, especially in the leftist
climate of San Francisco. Instead, I remained a blank slate of
blazer, T-shirt, and blue jeans in order to give my manifold
characters room to roam. In Edinburgh of 2013, I spent nearly every
evening dressed as Sarah after my show had finished. But this marks
the first time where I have consistently lived as Sarah. Until a
month ago, I had maintained the rule I had set for myself where I
would live as Sarah and only perform as Will. But I've since had a few
shows as Sarah which have received fairly positive reactions and I am
now attempting my first Edinburgh as her. I have been largely happier
during this time in ways I sometimes can't quite comprehend. I seem
to have garnered deeper and more significant relationships with
females, both platonic and intimate, and have somehow managed to stay
funny in the process, incorporating my humour into my female
personality. Thus defying my two major fears  when it came to outing
myself – a) that I would be alone for the rest of my life and b) by
being happy, I wouldn't be funny anymore.</b></p>
<p>This is my chance to do something groundbreaking.  Something very, very different.  I want to show the world I can be just as funny and critically acclaimed as Sarah as I was as Will.  I want to break the stereotype that an artist must be miserable in order to create.  Yes, there are transgender comedians.   From what I know of other
transgender performers' career trajectories, mine is different in
three distinct ways. Firstly, because I'm known for high-speed
character comedy, there is an assumption among many in my fan base
that Sarah is simply another character in my portfolio. If I was
doing regular stand-up comedy (or any regular job, for that matter)
the transition might be easier because there wouldn't be an
assumption that Sarah was simply another layer in an already
multi-layered performance. Secondly, I don't believe there are many
comedians who are attempting to transition while their career is
currently happening. For instance, I know some post-op transsexuals
who either began performing after they transitioned or used to
perform as a male, took time off to transition, and then started
performing again after the transition. There are transvestite
performers (that is to say, cross-dressers) like Eddie Izzard.  But to go from character comedian Will
Franken to character comedienne Sarah Franken in mid-career has so
far proven interesting, exciting and challenging; particularly when
it comes to questions of publicity photos and compere introductions.
Thirdly, defying expectations most punters might have of a
transgender in the performing arts, my politics don't always veer toward the expected.  <br/></p>

<h3>Nyobi is back in her first FULL COLOR story as she defends freedom of choice.</h3>
<p>Welcome, comic book fans, to the Nyobi: Birthright campaign. My most ambitious outing to date, this<strong> two-part miniseries </strong>presents Nyobi in full color from cover to cover for the very first time! </p>
<p><strong>Nyobi: Birthright</strong> takes us on a whirlwind journey through turbulent times as Nyobi defends a young woman from the hostility of a spiteful, ignorant mob looking to strip her of her rights. Tensions heat up in a extremely complex situation of the debates surrounding G-Noms, and it is now up to Nyobi to try and sort it out.    </p>
<p>If you're a longtime Nyobi fan, jump straight into this brand new <strong>24 page full color comic</strong>, featuring your choice of five startling covers!</p>
<p>If you're new to Nyobi, try two adventures and save on shipping by bundling the popular 2015 release of Nyobi #1 and the all new Nyobi: Birthright #1 right now! </p>
<p>Discover all of the incredible perks I've thoughtfully designed so that you can determine which tier of Nyobi: Birthright best suits your long box!</p>
<p>Before developing her powers, Nyobi was performing in all-girl J-pop supergroup The Geisha Dolls. At age 16, during a meet-and-greet at the Mega Plex mall in Tokyo, Nyobi's powers manifested while she was being mobbed by a large group of fans. A ring of light flashed in front of everyone's eyes and she was gone.</p>
<p>She reappeared at the back of the building, and quickly realized her life was about to change forever.</p>
<p>The media ran nuts with the story. Everyone had their theories as to what happened. ICON Entertainment tried to explain it as a special effect; a stunt. However, one week later, Nyobi appeared on My-Tube and exposed her true nature as a <strong>G-Nom</strong> to the world...</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>CBA (formerly known as C’est Bon Anthology) has been around for more than a decade, publishing lots of great comics that move far outside of the commercial mainstream.  Over the years, CBA has featured comics by great artists like Anke Feuchtenberger, Olivier Schrauwen, David Mack, Mari Ahokoivu, Kolbeinn Karlsson and many more.</p>
<p>Since the beginning, the people behind CBA are C'est Bon Kultur (CBK), an association of art comics enthusiasts and creators based in Malmö, Sweden. We strive to publish comics that otherwise would be hard to find. Comics that bring something more than what appeals to the lowest common denominator, that challenge the notion of what comics storytelling can or should be.</p>
<p>Now the anthology has fallen on hard times (long story, which you will soon be able to read at our website), but that shouldn’t stop us from publishing fantastic art comics, right? That is why we’re asking for your help!</p>
<p>We’re looking for donations to cover the costs of printing and distribution of our upcoming anthology, CBA vol 36: In the Pits of Madness.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What's in the Pits of Madness?</h3>
<p>The volume features a 43-page comic done in oil paintings by Spyros Verykios, as well as mind altering comics by Akab, Elena Guidolin and Serena Schinaia. The cover is by Radovan Popović. The volume is going to be 84 pages in total, and is edited by Mattias Elftorp, creator of various post apocalypse/dystopic comics and one of the founders of CBK.</p>

version. We estimate the total number of pages on more than 350. Like you could
see is a huge work, but is fun. The novel is made by traditional techniques:
pencil, ink and paper. But also, we try to use the new technologies like
sophisticate software for comic manufacturing and draw edition.</p>
<p>The process is as follows: We adapt the original text to a
comic format, and then we generate the storyboard. Since here, we design or
define the backgrounds, the clothes and the other stuffs like the musical
instruments. The next step is Miyo, who draw with pencils the original pages.
These pages go to the draw light desk for the ink process with conventional
black ink and paper. The ink work is scan and saves as digital format, in
special software the handwork is detailed and we put the text on this phase.

Frontwoman, Franny. I’m graphic designer from UNAM (The
National University of Mexico). I wrote the story and help with the inker
process.Our master draw or first pencil is Miyo. She’s is the most
expert on the group for drawing. With more than fifteen years of experience on
the comic industry, she can presume she worked for the best on Japan like the
legendary SNK Corporation. But now, we convinced her to take long holydays on
the Indie way production environment.Ana María González is our music expert. Few years ago she has her own
rock band (she plays the drums and bass) and also love experiment with sound
production. Additionally, she love draw and design.
Milla is
a graphic designer too, but she loves the fashion design. So, for Ana Zeppelin,
she helps us to create the wardrobe for the characters. Sometimes she helps
also to ink.
Daniel is
our inker, one of the most important phases on the comic book process. Daniel,
is enthusiastic, sometimes he draw the backgrounds and is the masculine
character of the band, ja ja ja.

Any. She helps us with the digital edition and corrections of the scanning
pages.  Her work is important for get a
detailed quality on the final pages.Nosotros

Franny. Yo soy diseñadora gráfica por la UNAM. Escribí la historia y ayudo a
entintar las páginas.
Nuestra
experta dibujante es Miyo. Ella es la mejor del grupo en cuanto a dibujo se
refiere. Con más de quince años de experiencia en la industria del comic, ella
puede presumir de haber trabajado con los mejores en Japón, como la prestigiosa
empresa SNK. Pero ahora, la convencimos de que tomara unas largas vacaciones y
probara la forma de producción de comic independiente.
Ana
María González es nuestra experta en música. Hasta hace no mucho, ella tenía su
propia banda (toca la batería y el bajo) y también experimentaba con la
producción digital de sonido. Adicionalmente, ella ama dibujar y diseñar.
Milla
es diseñadora gráfica también, pero está enfocada en el diseño de modas. Para
Ana Zeppelin ella se encarga de crear el vestuario de los personajes. A veces,
también, ayuda a entintar. 
Daniel
es nuestro entintador, se encarga de uno de los procesos más importantes en la
producción del comic. Daniel es entusiasta, también a veces se pone a fondear y

your contributions will help me keep this title relevant as well as introduce my work to new readers around the world.

 
What We Need & What You Get

$5,000.00 will help me keep my comics in production in 2021 and give me the boost I need to produce new titles in 2022
your contribution of $20 and up automatically sign you up for a preorder of Demon Mountain On Mars which I will ship to you in 2021
if my goal is not reached I will use what funds I have available to print as many books as I can

The Impact

my product will be valuable to you because of it's scarcity and the fact that this has been a dream of mine since I was eight years of age. I'm now 53 years old and my voice has yet to be heard by the greater populace.
21 contributors helped me to put out a great comic series in 2020. just think what I could with 100 contributors. or 200. I just want to tell stories.
I just want to tell stories. I need you to read them. I am nothing without a readership. thank you in advance.
 
Risks & Challenges


 
        the work is already done. the only challenge now is raising funds.
my plan is to stay productive.

<p><strong>A full-color, ten-page action-packed first mini-issue, exceptional art and sharp story telling. </strong></p>
<p>Fully, inked and colored comic book pages are quite expensive ($150-$200 each) to create. With me <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brokenmind/omega-issue-1crashing-into-earth?ref=category"" id=""_GPLITA_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""text-decoration: underline;"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Text-Enhance"">financing</a> the first five pages, the cover and logo, I am in desperate need of outside investors in order to complete this project. I've put as much of my own money as possible at this point and hope that Omega can interest enough people to bring him into reality.</p>
<p><br/>Why contribute to a ten page comic?</p>
<p>This mini sets the stage for the first issue of Omega; Issue 1, Escape; Issue 2, Rogue; and Issue 3, Hero.</p>
<p>And will be a good introcution to the world of Omega, the alien\human hybrid bred from the remains of the 1947 Roswell UFO crash and trained by elite military forces.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Read on for the story:</p>
<p>A UFO did, in fact, crash land in the New Mexico desert in the summer of 1947. Quickly intercepted by the US military, the unidentified flying object and its occupants, several humanoid extraterrestrials either already dead or in the final throes of death, were whisked away to secret installations.</p>
<p><br/>In 1985, after almost forty years of research, finally, a successful splice of alien and human DNA is achieved. </p>
<p><br/>Raised as a lab experiment that the military hoped to be a “super-soldier,” Omega, trained in combat, educated strenuously, and becomes the main component in General “Anvil” Hendricks elite military unit assigned to Phantom Base in Adaven, New Mexico.

<p>I am the creator and the writer of this story. I have novel and novella publishing credits in the small press and have had several science fiction and fantasy stories published in anthologies, magazines and online venues. Self-publishing has been my newest and most rewarding venture. While this is my first comic script to have produced, Omega has existed in one form or the other for many years. While the superhero market is getting quite crowded, I really do think there’s a unique flair in the science fiction/superhero aspects of Omega to set him apart from the rest.</p>

With an amazing ability to transfer human emotion to paper and an almost uncanny knack for creating scenes, I cannot think of a better artist to make Omega a living, breathing hero ready to take on the world.

<div id=""__tbSetup""> </div>
<p><span class=""notranlsate"">
</span></p></div>","A full-color, ten-page action-packed first mini-issue, exceptional art and sharp story telling. 
Fully, inked and colored comic book pages are quite expensive ($150-$200 each) to create. With me financing the first five pages, the cover and logo, I am in desperate need of outside investors in order to complete this project. I've put as much of my own money as possible at this point and hope that Omega can interest enough people to bring him into reality.
Why contribute to a ten page comic?
This mini sets the stage for the first issue of Omega; Issue 1, Escape; Issue 2, Rogue; and Issue 3, Hero.
And will be a good introcution to the world of Omega, the alien\human hybrid bred from the remains of the 1947 Roswell UFO crash and trained by elite military forces.
 
Read on for the story:
A UFO did, in fact, crash land in the New Mexico desert in the summer of 1947. Quickly intercepted by the US military, the unidentified flying object and its occupants, several humanoid extraterrestrials either already dead or in the final throes of death, were whisked away to secret installations.
In 1985, after almost forty years of research, finally, a successful splice of alien and human DNA is achieved. 
Raised as a lab experiment that the military hoped to be a “super-soldier,” Omega, trained in combat, educated strenuously, and becomes the main component in General “Anvil” Hendricks elite military unit assigned to Phantom Base in Adaven, New Mexico. General Hendricks, a three-star general, believes the Omega Project will be the key to his elusive fourth star.
 
After a perilous first mission that results in the daring rescue of the First Lady of the United States, but in which all but the commanding officer and Omega are decimated, the program is suspended, the plug pulled.
Omega must escape from the secret base and brave his way through the isolated desert with specially trained soldiers in deadly pursuit. With the full focus of one of the most determined men in the US military, it will be an impossible task, one that may just prove fatal for a mere human, but Omega is something quite different.
While Omega is pursued, the Earth falls prey to a new type of predator, one that has no qualms about total destruction of everything we hold dear. Will Omega, half-alien, half-human be our one hope?

<p>I'm Doug TenNapel, a comic book author and artist of over 16 graphic novels such as GEAR, CREATURE TECH, IRON WEST, GHOSTOPOLIS and CARDBOARD! I've created video game characters like EARTHWORM JIM, The NEVERHOOD and ARMIKROG and television shows like NICKELODEON'S CATSCRATCH and PROJECT GEEKER. I'm known for quirky humor, broad characters and plots full of character and heart.<br/><br/>As a big thank you to fans of my work I created BIGFOOT BILL, a childish, hairy, legend who stole the KRAKEN from POSEIDON and wears it as a super suit! I'm forgoing my usual studio work to work directly with my readers to independently fund an all-ages, blockbuster graphic novel!</p>
<p>Are you tired of humor comics that are more gross than funny? Me too! Do you like characters drawn with more skill and impact than ugly ca-ca that is made these days? Me too!

That includes the <strong><em>original authors, </em></strong><strong><em>the</em></strong><strong><em> writers adapting the stories into scripts, the pencillers, inkers, colorists, letterers, and of course, our printing and marketing costs</em></strong>. <br/><br/>We are a lean operation and we're not asking for more money than we absolutely need. (Remember, we have to pay Indiegogo right off the top). Every penny has been accounted for. Our profits will come from sales.</p>
<p>We've already put an enormous amount of time and effort into this project...from the professionally produced video, to the website, to the hundreds of stories we read through, to seeking out and negotiating with all of the talent.

<h3>Cat and Meringue's latest storybook adventure!</h3>
<p>'The Curse of Sir Thermidor' is a silly, pun-filled, fantastical adventure story about our heroes Cat and Meringue, a feline and a pudding who sail around in a Catamaran (get it?). They find an abandoned desolate reef and a melancholic lobster Knight called Sir Thermidor and end up swept up into an adventure involving monstrous yet delicious sea creatures, cursed black gold and lots of crabs!</p>

<h3>Who are Cat and Meringue?</h3>
<p>Welcome to the silly, adventurous, nautical, nutritional, quantum, metaphysical and sometimes downright ridiculous world of a feline and a pudding at sea in a twin-hulled boat. If you haven't seen them before Cat and Meringue are regulars on the UK comics scene appearing at many conventions year round, selling books, plushies and all sorts of other merch!</p>

<p>They started life as a successful daily webcomic, where I the artist, drew 1000 strips (nearly 3 years) of daily comics! They have since moved into the world of illustrated storybooks. Their first book 'The Saga of Starboy' came out earlier this year, and now I'm following it up with this one, 'The Curse of Sir Thermidor'</p>
<p>My name is Nich and I am the artist and writer of all things Cat and Meringue. I have been drawing comics for over 14 years, and am a part of the comics and games production company 'Big Punch Studios'. I create all sorts of stuff other than Cat and Meringue, such as 7STRING, the comic with the guitar-sword, and Sandwich Masters, the card game about making disgusting sandwiches!</p>

<h3>What is this campaign for?</h3>
<p>I am raising money for the printing of this colourful new adventure as a beautiful paperback book. The book will be a square format, 21x21cm perfect bound book with over 60 pages and over 30 full colour illustrations! Printing a book like this costs a bit of a chunk of dosh up front so I'm here today asking for your help with this! But if you support this book there will be a reward for you!

<p>If I don't make my goal, the book will still get made, it will just take a little longer. In that situation, I will keep you updated and then get in contact with all of you who pledged and get your reward out to you as soon as I can!</p>

<h3>What are the rewards?</h3>
<p>This campaign is a small one so I'm keeping the rewards simple. That said, if it flies beyond my intended goal then I do have some pretty cool stretch goals in mind. We'll talk about those, as and when we get there!</p>

<p>The main reward is a copy of the book. If you pledge at the lowest tier you get yourself a digital PDF copy of the book! Next tier up gets you a glorious printed copy in the post (and the PDF). Topmost tier bags you a super limited-edition shiny enamel pin badge of Sir Thermidor the lobster knight himself, (along with the printed book and PDF)! I only have a mockup of the Sir Thermidor pin at this stage, but this will be the design and it will be a hard enamel pin, in silver!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The book is done, written and illustrated so the risks and challenges are few. I have printed a book just like this (The Saga of Starboy), with the exact same printer and they have never let me down. They are quick, reliable and their standard is excellent.</p>
<p>The badge will take a little longer than the books, so those who pledge at the badge tier will have to wait a little longer for their rewards. But I'll keep you updated every step of the way!</p>
<p>I have run many crowdfunding campaigns, most recently a very successful campaign for the creation of Cat and Meringue plushies (which now fill my house, floor to ceiling). So I foresee no issues at all. If there are any, you will be the first to know and I will immediately tell you how I intend to fix them. I believe in keeping my backers up to date with everything.</p>
<h2><strong>THANK YOU!</strong></h2>
<p>I really hope you consider supporting this little campaign and helping me add yet more silliness to the world of Cat and Meringue and our real world too! </p>
<p>See you out on the Secret Sea!</p>

</div></div>","Cat and Meringue's latest storybook adventure!
'The Curse of Sir Thermidor' is a silly, pun-filled, fantastical adventure story about our heroes Cat and Meringue, a feline and a pudding who sail around in a Catamaran (get it?). They find an abandoned desolate reef and a melancholic lobster Knight called Sir Thermidor and end up swept up into an adventure involving monstrous yet delicious sea creatures, cursed black gold and lots of crabs!

Who are Cat and Meringue?
Welcome to the silly, adventurous, nautical, nutritional, quantum, metaphysical and sometimes downright ridiculous world of a feline and a pudding at sea in a twin-hulled boat. If you haven't seen them before Cat and Meringue are regulars on the UK comics scene appearing at many conventions year round, selling books, plushies and all sorts of other merch!

They started life as a successful daily webcomic, where I the artist, drew 1000 strips (nearly 3 years) of daily comics! They have since moved into the world of illustrated storybooks. Their first book 'The Saga of Starboy' came out earlier this year, and now I'm following it up with this one, 'The Curse of Sir Thermidor'
My name is Nich and I am the artist and writer of all things Cat and Meringue. I have been drawing comics for over 14 years, and am a part of the comics and games production company 'Big Punch Studios'. I create all sorts of stuff other than Cat and Meringue, such as 7STRING, the comic with the guitar-sword, and Sandwich Masters, the card game about making disgusting sandwiches!


What is this campaign for?
I am raising money for the printing of this colourful new adventure as a beautiful paperback book. The book will be a square format, 21x21cm perfect bound book with over 60 pages and over 30 full colour illustrations! Printing a book like this costs a bit of a chunk of dosh up front so I'm here today asking for your help with this! But if you support this book there will be a reward for you! See below for the rewards.

If I don't make my goal, the book will still get made, it will just take a little longer. In that situation, I will keep you updated and then get in contact with all of you who pledged and get your reward out to you as soon as I can!

My name is John O. Nelson better known as John O. I have been in the 
entertainment business for 15 years.  I have created a niche and gained an impressive following online.My lateest project is a new web series that I am producing 
called ""Everybody Knows John O.""
“Everybody Knows John O. Overview”:
“Everybody Knows John O.” is a web series about once a guy called, John O. who is known to most as a washed up, once famous, child actor. As he grew up, John O. experienced everything a young man in 
Hollywood could; clubs, women, and drugs.  It all ended, when he had a nervous breakdown on a national television 
show talk show. From there, his life spiraled downward into a self-destructive 
pool of despair. Soon after his public collapse, his hit television show “Momma 
You Crazy” was canceled. His agent decided to not represent him anymore, and 
finding work became equivalent to finding Bigfoot.
With no prospects of work, John took the last of his money and moved 
back home to Iowa, where he feels that no one will judge him and he can have a 
new lease on life. With nothing else to lose, John decides to invest in an Organic Cow Manure 
farm, which later becomes a big hit among the Mother Earth crowd.
Some time passes and John O’s new life is working out great for him. He is in a 
loving relationship with a beautiful local woman named Angie. His supportive 
younger brother Carl moves to Iowa to help him on the farm.  To top it off, John 
O. also has his loyal dog Bumpers ?; life couldn’t be better.
One day John O. receives a phone call from his former agent who gives him the 
news; one of his former co-stars has passed away after being in a huge 
accident involving a truck full of rabbit squirrel. John O. returns to Los 
Angeles, against his better judgment, to pay his respect to the friend. During 
the funeral, his former agent and manager convinces him to make a comeback. 
Although not very interested in living the celebrity life again, his star struck 
girlfriend and little brother talk him into going back into listening to his agent/manager.
After a few weeks of being back on the audition grind, John O. is told by his 
girlfriend Angie that she is leaving him for his archenemy “Kel Mitchell” (Of 
Keenan & Kel) who is now a “C” list actor himself and is trying to make a

With that in mind I would like to cross the word book with, comic. Perhaps the term, graphic novel would be more accurate. For years authors and directors have depicted a zombie apocalypse to be something of a Rambo affair. Let's pick up a hammer and see how many we can clobber! I see it differently. If an undead nightmare happened right now, what would you do? Would you run out into the street and take out as many as you could? Neither would I. I'd hide just like the rest of humanity.</p>
<p>In this ""graphic novel"" I'll take you on a fresh look around the panic stricken zombie apocalypse, with stories from believable characters. To accompany the book I would also like to make a YouTube series that would support some of the characters back stories. This would be presented as a radio show as the apocalypse breaks out. To achieve this I would need to hire a few voice actors as I would like the series to be on par with the novel. In addition to the novel and web series I would need to launch a website for promotional reasons. This would allow all fans &amp; future fans of the series to receive regular updates on the series.</p>
<p>The funds would be dispersed thus:</p>
<p>£0-350 / Processor<br/>£351-2000 / Illustrator, editor, self publishing<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">£2001-2450 /  Web Series<br/>£2451-2500 / Web Hosting</span></p>

<p>There are a selection of perks available to chose from and more may be added if the others sell out. If you have any questions regarding the project, please feel free to contact me.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution will go a long way in my quest to self publish. Even the smallest of donations will be appreciated. The proceeds of the book will go towards another in the instalment. Your generosity will go a long way to making this dream a reality.</p>

<div>If the novel is a success and there is a small amount of the budget left, I would like to adapt the novel into a YouTube series.

<h3>Who is Sailor Comics?</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Caleb Manci.  I am an actor, writer and producer living in Los Angeles.  It is my belief that entertainment should be used for the purpose of spreading ideas so when I became aware that the T.gondii virus effects approximately 80% of the population and then discovered that virtually no one knows about it, I knew I had to do something.<br/><br/>The illustration, printing and marketing of the first issue has been completely funded out of pocket.  To date I have spent approximately $10,000 on it and I have made nothing. Which is fine.  My intent is to begin conversations that can lead to a cure, not to become rich.<br/></p>
<p>Since I am a writer and not a scientist, I can't collect data or create studies but I can fuel the imagination of those that can.  That is why I've turned to you and the internet community in order to help spread the word about this harmful disease.  Please watch the video for more information about the wide-spread impact of the virus.  If you can't contribute, please share both the video and this campaign in order to simply make more people aware.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Funding and Perks</span><br/></p>
<p>In light of what I've already spent, I am asking very little.  In no way do I expect others to fund this entire comic book insanity.  However, I am looking for a little help to raise the necessary cash for the largest expenditure, namely, the branding and printing.  $2500 will take the collection of drawings I've commissioned and turn it into about a 1000 books, complete with ISBNs and barcodes, ready to sell.</p>
<p>What you get for what you donate:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>$10</b> - Either <b>Issue 1: Secret Agents</b> <i>or</i> <b>Issue 2: Inside Cat Taffy</b> autographed and sent to you.</li>

<li>
<b>$250 </b>- <b>Dedication of your choice</b> on the opening page of Issue 2, <b>original artwork</b> from the comics along with <b>Issue 1: Secret Agents </b><i>and </i><b>Issue 2: Inside Cat Taffy.</b>

Help Change the World
As explained above and by the video, Toxoplasma Gondii is a very real threat to the mental well-being of humans.

Although it was discovered in 1908, it was considered completely harmless until recently. 

 It can be contracted by contact with cats, eating unwashed vegetables or by consuming pork.  

Great Britain places the number of infections at approximately 35,000 per year.
As 2013, 38 studies found a positive correlation between toxoplasmosis and schizophrenia.

Numerous studies have shown a positive correlation between a toxoplasmic infection of the frontal lobe and suicidal tendencies in women.


Recently the virus has been linked to ADHD and OCD.

<p>Now, here's the promises part of this campaign.</p>
<p>A big reason why I have stopped <b>fansubbing </b>with my group <b>naisho </b>is that my computer would freeze up constantly and can't even really handle Aegisub anymore because of death. <br/></p>
<p>Now, we're planning to revive naisho with more Kasumin subs eventually<b> anyway</b>. Me getting a new PC will not be the reason that revives naisho, <b>but</b> what it will do is make me more able to actually work and get releases out much faster. <br/></p>
<p>Another thing that will happen is <b>more drawing</b>, which no one really gains anything from cause my art is bad but maybe it's fun to see me get better. I'm still drawing but at the moment drawing on my computer is impossible cause it will die on me after 2 minutes in Sai.</p>
<p>And also,<b> I won't die</b>. I dunno why anyone would enjoy my company but if you're my friend, odds are you do. So me not dying could be something you'd like. Maybe.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<b>Thank you for reading.</b><br/>
<p>Note: <i>I really only need something that works and doesn't die on me every few 
hours. For that, I don't actually need 500€, around 300€ would be 
enough, but 500€ is the minimum that indiegogo allows. Any extra money goes to a faster computer, of course.</i><br/>

<p>Hi, Everybody. I'm Vincent Ferrante, publisher of <strong>Monarch Comics</strong> as well as the creator and writer of one of our two flagship characters, <strong><i>Witch Hunter</i></strong>. Monarch Comics was founded in 2008 to publish the <strong>Witch Hunter</strong> comic book and diversify the Witch Hunter brand into toys, animation, TV, and films. Over the last ten years we've expanded our fanbase and online distribution through exhibiting at shows like the New York Comic Con and partnering with companies like DriveThru Comics, ComicsPlus, and Amazon, with all of our titles soon to be available on Comixology. In the course of our expansion, our line has grown to include our other flagship title, <strong>The Saga of Evil Monkey Man</strong>, plus a supernatural Viking adventure series, <strong>The Last</strong>, and a cosmic horror series, <strong>The Winter Lantern</strong>. </p>

<p>What is Danger-Squad you ask? Well, Danger-Squad is a comedic science-fiction comic book story that takes place around 300 years in the future, in the furthest reaches of the galaxy. A team of disjointed and neurotic characters take a venturesome journey through the universe led by their fearless and erratic captain named Dirk Domingo.</p>
<div><strong>Who's Dirk?  </strong></div>
<p>At the center of our story is Captain Dirk Domingo. An eccentric, impulsive space captain who ventures the galaxy searching for adventure and the next payday to maintain his ship ""The Stallion.""</p>
<p>Deep down, he longs to discover the reason, and meaning to his overall existence. In the meantime, he lives from moment-to-moment and teams up with a maladjusted group of space nomads who all have their own personal goals and aspirations.</p>
<div> </div>
<div><strong> What to Expect </strong></div>
<p>Think of your favorite space story with a twist of retro-futurism. While it has a humorous, light hearted side, it's also a deeper science fiction adventure in the spirit of Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clark and Phillip K. Dick.</p>
<p>There's a vast cosmos of diverse space villains to venture through. An array of conscious planets, and bizarre deep-space anomalies.</p>
<p><strong> What's in the Book? </strong></p>
<p>The content and packaging of the book is as follows: This is the first Danger-Squad graphic novel, which would be the origin story. It would be 50 pages of colorful high quality paper. The softcover measures at 8.5"" x 12.5"" and features the Danger-Squad origin story followed by vivid splash pages. Looking to have guest artists also contribute to these splash pages with their own creative visual interpretations.</p>
<p><strong>The Budget and Costs </strong></p>
<p>The budget of this comic book includes the collaboration with a colorist, an inker, and letterer. I'm creating 300 copies of this story to share with readers far and wide. I'm looking to invest an amount on the marketing and promotion to put out there for the public consumption and awareness. (Comic-Con, post cards, and travel to various art related events). </p>
<p><strong>Over 2 Years in Development</strong></p>
<p>I'm the creator, writer, and the artist of this story. All these years have prepared me for a special opportunity like this. It's all coming together full circle now. I want this project to represent my passion, respect, and appreciation for the comic book, and science-fiction medium.</p>
<p>With your support, I can complete, publish, market and distribute my first major comic. I want to make this a quality work, which represents my passion, respect, and appreciation for the comic book, and science-fiction medium. I would be sincerely grateful for any amount you can contribute to this dream! Let's do this together!</p>

The weak die or become slaves, eternally in service to those of means. The lords create weapons and machines of industry in their great cities that cause pollution, making the world even more of a wasteland.

The Elf Slave, Nis'si, continues to tell our anti-hero how they met and this begins to open up more doors to those memories that have been somehow locked to him.

<p><i>Broken </i>follows A'tal, a woman raised as a warrior and earning her coin as a wasteland mercenary. More important to her than the money, is the honor she finds in the constant battle for survival in the harsh wastes. The story begins with our Heroine returning to her home years after she left her family behind in search of her glory. While there, she will learn of  great threats against her remaining family and the shanty-town she once called home. Join A'tal and her companions; a gruff, dwarven mechanic, a foul-mouthed human and even an enchantingly beautiful, yet equally deadly half-elf as they face off against the greatest threat they have known.</p>

What little green there is has been harvested by the lords of the lands to further their wealth and power. The weak die or become slaves, eternally in service to those of means. The lords create weapons and machines of industry in their great cities that cause pollution, making the world even more of a wasteland. Groups of orcs, elves, humans and other races roam the land, scavenging what they can to build their own weapons and ammunition to destroy. Slavery is rampant, both in the wastes and the cities.


""Sample page from Lowlife Issue #2""

In the second installment of Lowlife, the story picks up right where it left off. The Elf Slave, Nis'si, continues to tell our anti-hero how they met and this begins to open up more doors to those memories that have been somehow locked to him. We also learn more of her backstory as well. How she became a slave, why she didn't want him to become her owner, yet even though he did, why she doesn't resist. 

""Sample page from Lowlife Issue #2""
Lowlife Issue #2 promises to be even more action packed, just as sexy and have more individual character development than its predecessor.
NOTE: Lowlife contains graphic violence, nudity, adult language and some sexual content. Reader discretion advised.

Broken follows A'tal, a woman raised as a warrior and earning her coin as a wasteland mercenary. More important to her than the money, is the honor she finds in the constant battle for survival in the harsh wastes. The story begins with our Heroine returning to her home years after she left her family behind in search of her glory. While there, she will learn of  great threats against her remaining family and the shanty-town she once called home. Join A'tal and her companions; a gruff, dwarven mechanic, a foul-mouthed human and even an enchantingly beautiful, yet equally deadly half-elf as they face off against the greatest threat they have known.

""Sample Page from Broken #1""
Broken is an action packed story of redemption, violent, haunted pasts and survival against overwhelming odds. It features the likenesses of Atalee Judy, Aelflaed, Jade Crystal and Steve Hornbek to name a few. It is beautifully drawn by Jose Jaro and colored by Lowlife artist Ewelina Mroczkowska.
NOTE: Though not as explicit as Lowlife, Broken does contain graphic violence, adult language and adult content. Reader discretion advised.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Ian Jay! I've been making comics seriously since 2005. I have a B.F.A. in Sequential Art from the Savannah College of Art and Design, and I currently split my time between working on a graphic novel (<i>Epiphany</i>) and several short-story comic projects. My ultimate career goal is to support myself off my comic work, and I feel that creating this book will bring me one step closer to achieving that dream.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>Ian Jay Super Comics: Volume One</i> is a book that includes significant comic I've done since I started college (not including <i>Epiphany, </i>which will get its own book release later this year). It can be viewed multiple ways: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>As a document of an artist's improvement over several years of practice and refinement.<br/>
</li>
<li>As a portfolio of the wide variety of different styles and subject matter that I can cover.</li>
<li>As a durable, portable and comprehensive replacement for readers' minicomic collections.</li>
<li>As a big book full of really weird comics.</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It will give fans something cool to hang onto and share for years, it will give people who have never heard of me a starting point to understanding the kind of work I do, and it will give me a professional edge with potential employers. By printing this book, I hope to take my skills and reputation to a higher level. </div>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need a bare minimum of nine hundred dollars to get the books printed and shipped out. I'm doing this fundraiser through Indiegogo's Flexible Funding system, so if you pre-order the book, you're going to get a copy, even if we don't manage to raise enough money in time.

Depending on your ability to contribute and invest in Solipsistic Pop, there are several exciting incentives available - from signed, exclusive postcards and badges to pre-ordered copies of Solipsistic Pop 4, free tickets to launch events, digital downloads, original artwork, limited edition prints, a credit in the book and even extremely rare printing plates.

Every little helps and whatever you can spare to help support us will be greatly appreciated. Everyone who donates will receive regular updates about Solipsistic Pop 4's progress before anyone else and will be invited to future Solipsistic Pop events throughout 2012.

UPDATE: Now SP4 is at the printers, the later IndieGoGo perk incentive of having a credit in the book cannot be honoured. Additional original artwork and early print proofs will be shipped instead.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<em>         Reality Not Included</em> is a comic anthology that shows the talents of the illustrators and animators from Brigham Young University. This is not a college-backed project, just a big group of friends and colleagues who wanted to get together and show what we can do as artists and story-tellers. Our motley little crew ranges from college students just getting their feet wet to professional artists who work in prestigious studios in the animation industry. Our participants specialize in different fields such as concept art, illustration, character animation, and storyboarding. Each artist creates their own comic or illustration thus bringing their own unique styles and abilities to the book.</div>

<p>        Our goal is to raise at least $4,000 to print extra books along with additional materials to sell at Dragon Con in Altanta, Georgia. All funds go to printing and binding the books, posters, transportation of our materials to Atlanta, and to printing and shipping all incentives to our donors. We already have many books printed, but we need to print a lot more for the convention.</p>
<p>        More importantly, your donations help our artists with their careers. Conventions like Dragon Con are fantastic opportunities for us to network and publicize our work. The entertainment industry is rapidly getting more and more competitive, making it harder for us to find work after college. We created this book with the idea of giving our arists an opportunity to get their feet in the door.</p>

<h4>Perks</h4>

<p></p>New York, early nineties; drugs are becoming a big problem and all sorts of criminal activities are afflicting the city. Using the ensuing chaos as a cover, Joel Rifkin becomes the most prolific serial killer ever known to the city of New York. Within 4 years, he murdered seventeen prostitutes. Skip Jensen first discovered this story while looking into the singer of a punk group that he loved. He discovered  that Joel Rifkin shared the same musical interest. There began an investigation through the dark alleys of New York into the notorious life of Joel Rifkin.<br/><br/>Skip Jensen is a respected musician with four albums to his credit. His first graphic novel <b>Lachine Beach</b> chronicled his youth in Lachine, a suburb of Montreal, in the late seventies and early eighties. With a simple drawing style, Jensen tells affecting stories, writing like a professional journalist,  masterfully mixing facts with emotions.<br/><br/><h4>

 wrenching and powerful, here is an avant-garde creation which breaks 
with the traditional narrative of history. Here is a tale that each will
 read and recognize, entering the rich cultural universe of these great 
movers of Canadian history that were, and are. the First Nations.  - Excerpt form the introduction by historian Denys Delâge.Louis
 Rémillard has been active on the Quebec comics scene since the early 
eighties. He has spent 5 years researching and drawing this book, an 
amazing true tale from a history that we barely know. Probably the best 
graphic novel ever done on the subject of First Nations and how they 
lived. 
En français, 128 pages, noir et blanc. 
Percutant
 et d’une exceptionnelle force évocatrice, voilà une œuvre 
avant-gardiste qui rompt avec le narratif de l’histoire traditionnelle. 
Voilà un récit que tout un chacun lira pour s’y reconnaître et pour 
entrer dans le riche univers culturel de ces grands acteurs de 
l’histoire que furent et que sont les Premières Nations. - Extrait de la préface de l’historien Denys Delâge.Louis
 Rémillard dessine et publie de la bande dessinée au Québec depuis les 
années 80. Après 5 ans de recherches et de travail, il nous présente son
 plus beau récit. Probablement le meilleur roman graphique sur le thème 
des premières nations, révélant des aspects inédits de ces peuples qui 
résonnent encore aujourd'hui avec notre sensibilité contemporaine. Un 
livre exceptionnel!

Using the ensuing chaos as a cover, Joel Rifkin becomes the most prolific serial killer ever known to the city of New York. Within 4 years, he murdered seventeen prostitutes. Skip Jensen first discovered this story while looking into the singer of a punk group that he loved. He discovered  that Joel Rifkin shared the same musical interest.

Later, on the set of the new film, when the director yells action, Ron begins blasting Pink Lemonade. When she refuses to fight, Barzibelly Jr. (the strange being seen in her visions back in issue one) gives her control over what happens next in the film…and I promise you don’t wanna miss what she comes up with!</p><p>Rising star Nick Cagnetti brings us back to the wildly colorful world of Pink Lemonade.

But things don't always work out the way we plan.  In issue one, Pink Lemonade found herself in jail, after a big misunderstanding with some cops, while trying to help a child.  And just when you thought she was sunk, hotshot movie producer Zavi Xarad shows up with an offer to help. In this new second issue, when footage of Pink Lemonade’s splashy balloon rescue stunt on a movie set (see issue one) gets leaked internally by that same hotshot movie producer who offered to help her, the public’s interest is piqued! They think Pink Lemonade is a new character in the upcoming Ron Radical movie being filmed!  Meanwhile, while attempting to bring back the original OJ-BOT, Pink Lemonade is tricked into signing a contract to co-star in a film with Ron Radical. Later, on the set of the new film, when the director yells action, Ron begins blasting Pink Lemonade. When she refuses to fight, Barzibelly Jr. (the strange being seen in her visions back in issue one) gives her control over what happens next in the film…and I promise you don’t wanna miss what she comes up with!Rising star Nick Cagnetti brings us back to the wildly colorful world of Pink Lemonade. A story full of both fun and mystery, readers are sure to get lost in her strange, action-packed adventures!  Don’t miss the second issue (and first, if you missed it) that Lizzy Garcia from BUT WHY THO? called ""a comic series with an art style that blows most of what is on stands out of the water.""You can pick up your copies of Pink Lemonade #2 from this IndieGoGo campaign, which includes the Standard Cover, the TINTIN inspired Variant Cover by Rich (DRY COUNTY) Tommaso, and the IndieGoGo Exclusive Cover (available ONLY from this campaign)!  You can also pick up a signed Standard Cover by Nick Cagnetti, or a signed Variant Cover by Rich Tommaso!  And don't forget, you can grab the first issue as well!AND WHEN YOU CHECK OUT, YOU WILL SEE SEVERAL ADD-ON OPTIONS THAT YOU CAN ADD TO YOUR ORDER!  THIS INCLUDES SIGNED AND UNSIGNED COPIES OF PINK LEMONADE, AND PINK LEMONADE ORIGINAL SKETCH CARDS LIKE THESE, EACH DRAWN BY PINK LEMONADE CREATOR NICK CAGNETTI...Also, Nick Cagnetti will be making some of his gorgeous original PINK LEMONADE art available.  There will also be a handful of PINK LEMONADE pin-ups available from a group of amazing artists who believe in what Nick is doing.  All of this original art will be available as add-on rewards during the course of the campaign, and will be released one by one over the next few weeks!  Here is an example of what you can expect...Through this campaign we hope to raise some of the funds necessary to print and ship PINK LEMONADE #2, as well as pay for the variant cover.  We are only asking for $1000, but we do have some stretch goals in mind if we go beyond the initial goal.Thank you for your interest in PINK LEMONADE!  Please let us know if you have any questions.And now...here are a few WIP black and white interior pages to get you excited!  Colors and letters coming soon!  And HERE is a look at some WIP panels from the PINK LEMONADE #2 back-up story entitled FREE DAY, written by Nick Cagnetti and illustrated by Don (MEGATON MAN) Simpson!  The story will be four pages long, and full color, once it's done!----------------------------------------------WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT PINK LEMONADE""Terrific and original like crazy"" –Michael Allred (MADMAN)""Dreamy 'bots, fun fandom examination and her bike is her best friend.

Entertaining, with solid art that is a mash up of Allred, Clowes, and animator Sally Cruikshank."" –David Hahn (SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN)""Nick Cagnetti's PINK LEMONADE is a quirky, good-hearted comic book series. Try a taste of PINK LEMONADE. You'll find it refreshing!"" –Michael T. Gilbert (MR.

<h3>Column: Vol. 1 Overview</h3>
<p>Column's story follows the crew of the Helcat, a US Army M1A2 Abrams main battle tank, in their adventure across the world fighting the Meta-National Transitory Pact. It is a lighthearted combat series with plenty of comedy and loads of action! As you may have guessed, it's World War 3, but with a bit of a twist. And no, it's not zombies...<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541802170/df76avvkk6ey8x620awt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Metas have developed a top secret technology only known as ""The Disruptor"". It's unknown how this weapon works, but it's effects are felt across the globe. Advanced GPS, satellite guided weapons, long range radar and radios --- all rendered useless, the Disruptor interfering with all forms of over-the-air signals. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541802225/ibf6ytjyd0pfp5zqmtip.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Without the massive advantage of automated weapons like UAVs and long range technologies like GPS-guided cruise missiles, the US and her allies were at an extreme disadvantage once war broke out. In 2026, the Metas made landfall in North America and the war seemed to be going their direction for 3 years. But the tide is turning...</p>

<p>This is where our story picks up. It's 2029 and the Allies are on the counter-attack. The men and women of the Army's 10th Special Missions Unit have been assigned the harrowing task of tracking down the Disruptor Device on land and eliminating it at all costs.</p>

</div></div>","What is Column: Vol. 1?
Column Vol. 1 is an action packed, full color, 6.5x10.25in (standard western comic size), 90+ page, manga-esque graphic novel. Fun characters, cute artwork and explosions.Column: Volume 1 is already completed and simply awaiting printing. This is your chance to get an EXCLUSIVE private edition variant of our first installment in a series of brand new graphic novels! (If you want to skip the description and just jump to a free digital version of the product, click here!)


What We Need & What You Get
We are looking to raise enough money for a limited print run of Column: Vol. 1 before it is released via a different publisher in 2019. We also would like to offer the chance to pick up a few exclusive variants of our character propaganda posters.It's the most fun you'll have with a comic this year!

Column: Vol. 1 Overview
Column's story follows the crew of the Helcat, a US Army M1A2 Abrams main battle tank, in their adventure across the world fighting the Meta-National Transitory Pact. It is a lighthearted combat series with plenty of comedy and loads of action! As you may have guessed, it's World War 3, but with a bit of a twist. And no, it's not zombies...
The Metas have developed a top secret technology only known as ""The Disruptor"". It's unknown how this weapon works, but it's effects are felt across the globe. Advanced GPS, satellite guided weapons, long range radar and radios --- all rendered useless, the Disruptor interfering with all forms of over-the-air signals. 


Without the massive advantage of automated weapons like UAVs and long range technologies like GPS-guided cruise missiles, the US and her allies were at an extreme disadvantage once war broke out. In 2026, the Metas made landfall in North America and the war seemed to be going their direction for 3 years. But the tide is turning...

This is where our story picks up. It's 2029 and the Allies are on the counter-attack. The men and women of the Army's 10th Special Missions Unit have been assigned the harrowing task of tracking down the Disruptor Device on land and eliminating it at all costs.

Jack and Hatch are two civilian volunteers of the Civil Defense Corps. The war has come to them. Will they survive their unexpected combat tour? How will they fare fighting alongside the Ladies of the 2nd Platoon of the 10th SMU? Guess you'll have to read to find out!

<p>I've had an idea/script for the last five years for a feature entitled Demonized. Without giving too much away, it's a dark comedy set in the late nineties about a demon who possess multiple people, one of them a bullied goth kid. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, time and money have always been an issue with getting this project off the ground as a movie, especially with the upcoming arrival of my second daughter in early December. So I decided to storyboard the project out, hand it off to the super talented artist and fellow Oregon movie maker, Joe Sherlock, and create a self-published graphic novel! The idea of seeing the story realized in a completely new medium (especially one I love) is very fun and exciting. Here's what he did with the first five pages (minus the dialogue). The inside cover my wife Sara designed.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary I've been making movies in Oregon since the early 2000s. In that time I have produced and directed 4 feature length projects and countless shorts and music videos. 
I've had an idea/script for the last five years for a feature entitled Demonized. Without giving too much away, it's a dark comedy set in the late nineties about a demon who possess multiple people, one of them a bullied goth kid. 
Unfortunately, time and money have always been an issue with getting this project off the ground as a movie, especially with the upcoming arrival of my second daughter in early December. So I decided to storyboard the project out, hand it off to the super talented artist and fellow Oregon movie maker, Joe Sherlock, and create a self-published graphic novel! The idea of seeing the story realized in a completely new medium (especially one I love) is very fun and exciting. Here's what he did with the first five pages (minus the dialogue). The inside cover my wife Sara designed.








What We Need & What You Get
 The $2900 will go towards printing the books and compensating Joe for his time spent illustrating the pages. He's doing it for practically nothing, especially given the time and energy that goes into drawing, inking, lettering, scanning and cleaning each page.
We have some very cool reward packages planned. Starting at a thank you in the book and ending at a character in the book being drawn to your likeness!
    The Impact My favorite part about movie making is storytelling, but it's always been a challenge to convey the story in my head onto the screen.

<h3>Issue #7: <i>Spooklyhoma!</i>
</h3>
<p>The dream: to give out free comics anthologies to show local talent. The reality: it's happening!</p>
<p>For our seventh issue, we're doing our first themed anthology with eight spooky stories. We have scary, heartfelt, action-packed, and even funny stories lined up! All we need is some money to print. You can help and get awesome rewards for going the extra mile to make art happen.</p>

<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>For our seventh issue, we have put together a 48-page anthology with eight stories to spook ya. Stories are all-ages so everyone can enjoy them; if it were a movie, we would rate it roughly PG with some fantasy violence. Each is from a different writer/artist team, so each is very different in tone and style. Here are a few sample pages:</p>

Razakel’s sympathies lie with the senate, and as Jillian continues to try and hold them back he eventually turns on his cousin. Now a general in the senate’s legion Razakel begins to attack neighboring countries, and brings with him a terrible new weapon, subjugating people, attempting to impose his vision on every person and place that he finds.

I'm 20 and I'm an actress. All my life, I've wanted to do nothing but inspire people.</p><p>On the popular app Tiktok, I discovered that people were cosplaying our favorite Spidey Characters, and I wanted to join in! But if I was going to do it, I was going to make sure that I stood out.</p><p>And what could possibly stand out more than a Purple-faced, white-haired Alien?</p><p>Soon after the first test cosplay with UltraViolet, she gained over 9k devoted followers, who either thought the symbiote was actually a part of the MCU or were already tagging Marvel to make her a part of it. After that, I invested some real money into her own custom costume. 19k followers later, the light bulb went off in my head.</p><p> </p><p>I had the chance to summon an actual team, composed of talented POC and LGBTQ+ members to write out an actual, relatable college hero. No gimmicks, no weird fetishizing tropes, no body clones. We're normalizing different body types, demolishing corny tropes, and above all, giving the struggling young adult, 9 to 5 college community the characters and story they NEED.</p><p> </p><p>UltraViolet is about a girl named Jai, a college Freshman who attends ASU West with her friends Ty and Sara. As she progresses through college, Jai faces different challenges with her pals, and of course; her symbiote.</p><p>The main characters from UltraViolet come from different backgrounds.  We feel it's crucial to have single-parent households normalized into comics, as not everyone can relate to having an upper-middle-class household with both of your biological parents. On top of that, we cover the topic of surviving on minimum wage and balancing work/life as a college student, because unfortunately, having a really cool Symbiote doesn't pay off your student loans. </p><p>UltraViolet also fights to destigmatize and get rid of the over-exaggeration and romanticization of mental illness. A study reported that 39 percent of students were struggling with at least one mental illness.

I'm 20 and I'm an actress. All my life, I've wanted to do nothing but inspire people.On the popular app Tiktok, I discovered that people were cosplaying our favorite Spidey Characters, and I wanted to join in! But if I was going to do it, I was going to make sure that I stood out.And what could possibly stand out more than a Purple-faced, white-haired Alien?Soon after the first test cosplay with UltraViolet, she gained over 9k devoted followers, who either thought the symbiote was actually a part of the MCU or were already tagging Marvel to make her a part of it. After that, I invested some real money into her own custom costume. 19k followers later, the light bulb went off in my head. I had the chance to summon an actual team, composed of talented POC and LGBTQ+ members to write out an actual, relatable college hero. No gimmicks, no weird fetishizing tropes, no body clones. We're normalizing different body types, demolishing corny tropes, and above all, giving the struggling young adult, 9 to 5 college community the characters and story they NEED. UltraViolet is about a girl named Jai, a college Freshman who attends ASU West with her friends Ty and Sara. As she progresses through college, Jai faces different challenges with her pals, and of course; her symbiote.The main characters from UltraViolet come from different backgrounds.  We feel it's crucial to have single-parent households normalized into comics, as not everyone can relate to having an upper-middle-class household with both of your biological parents. On top of that, we cover the topic of surviving on minimum wage and balancing work/life as a college student, because unfortunately, having a really cool Symbiote doesn't pay off your student loans. UltraViolet also fights to destigmatize and get rid of the over-exaggeration and romanticization of mental illness. A study reported that 39 percent of students were struggling with at least one mental illness. And that 39% percent deserves to know that their new favorite hero is fighting the same fight that they are. As you grow with Jai and the gang, you see them all truly figure out their footing and perspective on who they truly might be, and what they stand for.Meet The Mains!We won't spoil too much :) Name: Jai Clemens ( JJ ) Age: 19Sign: AriesFun Fact: JJ loves 80-90’s clothing and music! ( just don't quiz her though, you might be stuck there for hours)  Name: Ty GibbonsAge: 18Sign: CapricornFun Fact: Ty likes to make people feel awkward when she’s done with conversations Name: Sara D Tompson Age: 20Sign: VirgoFun Fact: Sara can name pretty much any celebrities' zodiac sign.  Comic Specifications:Since this is UltraViolets' first issue, we wanted to make sure that all aspects of the quality of the book left you all impressed and wanting more, down to the packaging.Page Count: 24Dimensions: 6.125 inches (width) x 9.25 inches (height, spine)Paper Quality: Premium 4-color on 70# Boise offset whiteBinding: Perfect BindingMeet The Team:Writer:Hey pals!

Readers will be introduced to Beorn, the fantastical island on which he lives, and get a first look at the magic (and danger!) that awaits our little Viking. Thanks to a successful Kickstarter campaign (Over $20,000 funded), the book now features a Case Hardcover (7.5x11) with Gold Foil Stamping, Embossing, and Gloss Spot Coating. With 40 pages of full-color story, and 12 pages of incredible guest artist pinups, this book will be a real beauty. The finishing touches are being put on the additional content, and the book will be ready to go to print before this campaign wraps up.  I want to make the most beautiful book possible! This is a labor of passion, and I am working hard to ensure the physical book embodies the love I have for Beorn's story. Cover mockup. Design and dimensions may change slightly.All books come signed by the creator.  Beorn knows he will be a legendary warrior any day now. In the meantime, he’ll spread his personal brand of mischief across his new home...a fantastical island where ancient myths, powerful gods, and magical fairy tales come to life. As rambunctious and unruly as Beorn can be, he somehow manages to endear himself to those around him and forge friendships with an amazing cast of characters and creatures. None of those friendships is more special than his secret friendship with a little troll named Goob.I've been working on Beorn's saga for around a decade. It was initially inspired by my long-time love for newspaper comic strips. But as I was writing the daily strip, Beorn's world kept growing. His slice of life experiences couldn't be separated from the amazing and fantastical world in which he lived. Soon, Beorn's story was chalk full of Norse mythology, and Old-World fairy tales. Epic fantasy and high adventure followed this kid wherever he went! His curiosity and his thirst for adventure were insatiable.  Beorn was a little Viking who kept leading me down roads full of big moments...and big feelings. I fell in love with the cast of characters. It was a delight to see how their relationships with Beorn, and each, other grew.Of course, not all of Beorn's world was safe and welcoming! Outside the safety of the small village where Beorn settled was a Dark Forest filled with dangerous and mysterious creatures and beings. Sometimes they were misunderstood and harmless. Other times, Beorn found himself in very real danger! But no matter how Beorn's world and saga grew, there was always one constant. At it's center, Beorn's story was about friendship. A magical friendship between a little Viking and his best friend who happened to be a troll. I have found it to be something very special, and I'm excited to finally share it.  In this first chapter, we will see Beorn's first fateful experiences as he lands on the island and discovers some of its inhabitants. I hope you'll join me in seeing this project come to life, and enjoy reading Beorn's adventures as much as I do!           I was very fortunate to have the support and contributions of some AMAZING artists for my Kickstarter campaign. These pictures by some of my all-time favorite artists will be featured in the pinup section of BEORN 1. You can get a good look at them below. I feel incredibly grateful to have these folks associated with my first book, and I hope you enjoy these pieces as much as I do!Matt Smith  Benjamin Schipper  Mike Hartigan  Jared Cullum  Eric Orchard  Simone D'Armini  Rob Guillory  Kevin Merriman  Jeff Smith   Cam Kendell  Will Henry   Scott Brown   Thank you so much for checking out BEORN, and giving it a chance. I've been really fortunate, and incredibly grateful, to have received the initial outpouring of support that's come my way. I really hope you'll consider joining us for the first chapter in Beorn's saga. Thank you!",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>[IT] </b>Abbiamo tutta l'estate per terminare tutti i fumetti e le illustrazioni ancora in corso (ma avrete modo di sbirciare in anteprima, nel corso della campagna, molte opere già terminate), e avremo il volume impaginato e stampato prima dell'inizio dell'autunno! Tutti i partecipanti sono professionisti, abituati a consegnare lavori di qualità con scadenze precise.</p>
<p>Sappiamo già chi stamperà al meglio non solo il volume, ma anche chi realizzerà tutti gli extra dei vari perk, dalle piccole spille ai poster.</p>
<p>Sì, è la prima volta che affrontiamo un progetto del genere, ma lo facciamo sulle spalle e con il supporto di amici più esperti, e con un'attenta pianificazione (derivata da un rapporto d'amore morboso di entrambe le Editor con le liste), e siamo pronti a gestire ogni imprevisto con la massima determinazione e trasparenza.</p>

<p><b>[ENG] </b>We've got the whole summer to finish all the comics and illustrations we haven't yet finished (but you'll get to see throughout the campaign a bit of what's been completed already), and we'll have everything printed and ready by early fall!

<p>We already know not only where we'll print the volume, but also how to get all the extra perks to you, from the pins to the posters.</p>
<p>Yes, it's the first time we embark on such a project, but we do it supported by expert friends and with a careful plan (borne of the Editors' obsession with lists and organization). We're ready to deal with any setbacks with determination and transparency.<br/></p>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions:</h2>
<div>
<b>[IT] </b><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span><i>I perk 'The Early Wizard Gets The Tome' e 'The Tome' sembrano uguali!</i></span></p>
<p>Lo sono, ma il primo è per i maghetti furbi che vogliono approfittare di una super promozione, solo per Indiegogo: Grimorio, a €12!</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i>I perk 'The Early Sorcerer' e 'The Sorcerer's Package' sembrano uguali!</i></p>
<p>Stesso discorso che per The Tome: approfittatene, qui la promozione è su soli 25 pacchetti!</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i>Nella descrizione di 'The Early Sorcerer' si parla delle reward di 'Your Own Grimoire'...</i></p>
<p>Un'interferenza con la bacchetta: intendevamo 'Your Complete Grimoire', ahimé non si possono effettuare modifiche sui perk a campagna iniziata e non possiamo correggere l'errore.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i>Ho preso [qualunque perk che non sia 'The Early Wizard Gets the Tome/The Tome'] ma mi fa pagare la spedizione, io voglio ritirarlo a Lucca!</i></p>
<p>A Lucca non avremo tutto il merchandising extra che vedete qui nel Crowdfunding, quindi l'unico perk che si può ritirare lì, o nei pick up point di Roma e Milano, è 'The Tome' o la sua versione scontata 'Early Wizard'.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Tutti gli altri dovranno venir spediti a casa vostra da fidi gufi! Ma non temete, questo avverrà subito dopo Lucca Comics. SE ci tenete molto a ritirare il volume a Lucca, potete indicarlo nel form che vi spediremo via email, da compilare a fine campagna: alla fiera potrete prendere il solo volume, e vi spediremo tutte le altre cose incluse nel perk dopo la fiera.</span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i>Ho preso 'The Early Wizard Gets the Tome/The Tome' ma non lo devo ritirare, lo voglio ricevere a casa, e non mi fa selezionare 'Shipping' insieme!</i></p>
<p>Basta prendere prima una perk, poi aprire di nuovo la pagina della campagna, e prendere l'altra.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><i>Ho preso 'The Early Wizard Gets the Tome/The Tome', posso avere la dedica sulla mia copia?</i></p>
<p>Per le dediche vere e proprie su un foglio a parte abbiamo dei perk appositi, quindi per correttezza verso chi li acquista la risposta è che di certo una dedica schizzata dentro il libro, in Fiera è sacra: ma sarà appunto uno schizzo veloce!</p>
<p><b>[ENG]</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><span><b><i>The perks 'The Early Wizard Gets The Tome' and 'The Tome' look the same!</i></b></span></p>
<p>They are, the first is an early bird version exclusive to this crowdfunding and limited to 70 spots (with half gone already), a super promotion: Grimorio at €12 only!</p>
<p><b><i>The perks 'The Early Sorcerer' e 'The Sorcerer's Package' look the same!</i></b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Same deal as for The Tome: take advantage, only 25 spots available for this!</span><br/></p>
<p><b><i>In the description of the perk ‘The Early Sorcerer' it mentions the reward of the perk 'Your Own Grimoire', that isn’t there...</i></b></p>
<p>A wrong touch of the wand: we meant 'Your Complete Grimoire', alas we can’t edit perks after the campaign begins so we’ll have to stick with the mistake.</p>
<p><b><i>I bought [any perk that isn’t 'The Early Wizard Gets the Tome/The Tome'] but it makes me pay for shipping, I want to pick it up in Lucca/Rome/Milan!</i></b></p>
<p>We won’t have all the extra merch you see here, at the Lucca Con, so the only perk you can pick up there (or at the two major italian cities) is ‘The Tome’ or its Early Bird version. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Everything else will be delivered swiftly to you by owl right after Lucca Comics. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">BUT if you really want to get the book at Lucca Con, just write so in the form we'll send to you after the campaign is over: we'll bring your copy to the con, but we'll still send you the rest of the rewards after the Con.</span></p>
<p><b><i>I got the 'The Early Wizard Gets the Tome/The Tome' perk, but I don’t want to pick it up and it won’t let me select the ‘Shipping’ perk at the same time!</i></b></p>
<p>You just have to take one perk first, then open up the campaign page again, and take the other: one after another, not together.</p>
<p><b><i>I got the 'The Early Wizard Gets the Tome/The Tome' perk, may I have a drawing on my copy?</i></b></p>
<p>We have special perks for full drawing, so to be fair to other backers, we’ll surely make a quick doodle for you in your copy at Lucca/at the presentations in Rome and Milan, but that’s all it’ll be: a quick doodle!</p>

[ENG] Grimorio is 100 pages of comics and illustrations on Witchcraft by 20+ artists. More than twenty different takes on the occult, the bewitched, unlike any other you'll find, accurately selected for you by Ariel Vittori and Laura Guglielmo.


[IT] Ariel ha già partecipato ad antologie internazionali (Food Porn) e lavora con fumetto e illustrazione da più di tre anni. Ha conosciuto Laura alla Bologna Children's Book Fair di due anni fa, innamorandosi delle sue storie. Laura stessa, oltre ad essere scrittrice sopraffina, lavora disegnando tra le altre cose per videogiochi, animazione, giochi da tavolo. 

Si sono trovate a sviluppare insieme una storia stregata, e con tanta voglia di raccontarla. Si sono chieste, 'Quanti altri avranno voglia di gridare una storia, senza avere un luogo in cui farla ascoltare? Quanti vorranno tracciare il segno di come vedono la stregoneria, tra le pagine del Grimorio con copertina esclusiva di Antonio de Luca (Warner Bros, Riot Games) e Mirko Failoni (Spectrum 23)?' Ed eccoli, tutti, o quasi... Dovremo pur svelarvi ancora altri misteri!

Nei prossimi giorni getteremo luce su ognuno di loro, parlando del loro lavoro per l'Antologia e fuori, quindi continuate a seguire la sezione degli aggiornamenti qui sulla nostra pagina e sugli altri social.





[ENG] Ariel has already partecipated in international anthologies (Food Porn) and she's been working with comics and illustrations for more than three years. She met Laura at Bologna Children's Book Fair two years ago and fell in love with her stories. Laura isn't just an amazing writer but an illustrator herself, working in the game and animation industry.
They had this witchy story, and they so wanted to tell it. So they wondered, 'How many others must have magical stories like this and no place to share them? How many would like to trace their vision of witchcraft in the pages of a Grimoire, with an exclusive cover by Mirko Failoni (Spectrum 23) and Antonio de Luca (Warner Bros, Riot Games)?'. Here they are, all of them... or almost. We simply must keep some mystery still!

With illustrations by:

Alice Girlanda, Astrid Lucchesi, Fabio Mancini, Giopota, Isabella Mazzanti, Romina Moranelli, Susanna Rumiz

[UPDATE] Arianna Robustelli, Nicolò Pellizzon and Flavia Biondi will be contributing as guests with 3 amazing prints included in perks from 40€ up, while Julia Sardà will be joining us with an illustration included in the book!




And Comics by:

Ariel Vittori, Eleonora Bruni, Freddie Tanto, Greta Xella, Laura Guglielmo, Laura Vivacqua, Monica Sangermano, Morena Forza, Noemi de Maio, Silvia Vanni, Sumi, Tessa Black.

[ENG] With €5000 we could not only print more copies, but add content as well. At least 25 more pages, some by authors still shrouded in mystery. 
With €6000 we can give this wonderful t-shirt to all backers of €100+ perks, but with €10 only added to your perk (excluding the digital ones, 'MAGIC POTION' and 'INVISIBLE ENCHANTMENT'), you can have it too!
With €9000 we stretch to the most enchanting goal of all: pay an advance to all the 20+ artists of the Coven. We all believe in the Grimoire's magic, and that's why we've been working from the first light of day to the soft glow of the moon. There could be no better proof of how much you believe in it, too.



    

[IT] Abbiamo tutta l'estate per terminare tutti i fumetti e le illustrazioni ancora in corso (ma avrete modo di sbirciare in anteprima, nel corso della campagna, molte opere già terminate), e avremo il volume impaginato e stampato prima dell'inizio dell'autunno! Tutti i partecipanti sono professionisti, abituati a consegnare lavori di qualità con scadenze precise.
Sappiamo già chi stamperà al meglio non solo il volume, ma anche chi realizzerà tutti gli extra dei vari perk, dalle piccole spille ai poster.
Sì, è la prima volta che affrontiamo un progetto del genere, ma lo facciamo sulle spalle e con il supporto di amici più esperti, e con un'attenta pianificazione (derivata da un rapporto d'amore morboso di entrambe le Editor con le liste), e siamo pronti a gestire ogni imprevisto con la massima determinazione e trasparenza.



[ENG] We've got the whole summer to finish all the comics and illustrations we haven't yet finished (but you'll get to see throughout the campaign a bit of what's been completed already), and we'll have everything printed and ready by early fall! All the contributors are professionals, used to delivering high quality work on precise deadlines.
We already know not only where we'll print the volume, but also how to get all the extra perks to you, from the pins to the posters.
Yes, it's the first time we embark on such a project, but we do it supported by expert friends and with a careful plan (borne of the Editors' obsession with lists and organization). We're ready to deal with any setbacks with determination and transparency.
Frequently Asked Questions:

[IT] I perk 'The Early Wizard Gets The Tome' e 'The Tome' sembrano uguali!
Lo sono, ma il primo è per i maghetti furbi che vogliono approfittare di una super promozione, solo per Indiegogo: Grimorio, a €12!
I perk 'The Early Sorcerer' e 'The Sorcerer's Package' sembrano uguali!
Stesso discorso che per The Tome: approfittatene, qui la promozione è su soli 25 pacchetti!
Nella descrizione di 'The Early Sorcerer' si parla delle reward di 'Your Own Grimoire'...
Un'interferenza con la bacchetta: intendevamo 'Your Complete Grimoire', ahimé non si possono effettuare modifiche sui perk a campagna iniziata e non possiamo correggere l'errore.
Ho preso [qualunque perk che non sia 'The Early Wizard Gets the Tome/The Tome'] ma mi fa pagare la spedizione, io voglio ritirarlo a Lucca!
A Lucca non avremo tutto il merchandising extra che vedete qui nel Crowdfunding, quindi l'unico perk che si può ritirare lì, o nei pick up point di Roma e Milano, è 'The Tome' o la sua versione scontata 'Early Wizard'.
Tutti gli altri dovranno venir spediti a casa vostra da fidi gufi! Ma non temete, questo avverrà subito dopo Lucca Comics. SE ci tenete molto a ritirare il volume a Lucca, potete indicarlo nel form che vi spediremo via email, da compilare a fine campagna: alla fiera potrete prendere il solo volume, e vi spediremo tutte le altre cose incluse nel perk dopo la fiera.
Ho preso 'The Early Wizard Gets the Tome/The Tome' ma non lo devo ritirare, lo voglio ricevere a casa, e non mi fa selezionare 'Shipping' insieme!
Basta prendere prima una perk, poi aprire di nuovo la pagina della campagna, e prendere l'altra.
Ho preso 'The Early Wizard Gets the Tome/The Tome', posso avere la dedica sulla mia copia?
Per le dediche vere e proprie su un foglio a parte abbiamo dei perk appositi, quindi per correttezza verso chi li acquista la risposta è che di certo una dedica schizzata dentro il libro, in Fiera è sacra: ma sarà appunto uno schizzo veloce!
[ENG]

The perks 'The Early Wizard Gets The Tome' and 'The Tome' look the same!
They are, the first is an early bird version exclusive to this crowdfunding and limited to 70 spots (with half gone already), a super promotion: Grimorio at €12 only!
The perks 'The Early Sorcerer' e 'The Sorcerer's Package' look the same!
Same deal as for The Tome: take advantage, only 25 spots available for this!
In the description of the perk ‘The Early Sorcerer' it mentions the reward of the perk 'Your Own Grimoire', that isn’t there...
A wrong touch of the wand: we meant 'Your Complete Grimoire', alas we can’t edit perks after the campaign begins so we’ll have to stick with the mistake.
I bought [any perk that isn’t 'The Early Wizard Gets the Tome/The Tome'] but it makes me pay for shipping, I want to pick it up in Lucca/Rome/Milan!
We won’t have all the extra merch you see here, at the Lucca Con, so the only perk you can pick up there (or at the two major italian cities) is ‘The Tome’ or its Early Bird version. Everything else will be delivered swiftly to you by owl right after Lucca Comics. BUT if you really want to get the book at Lucca Con, just write so in the form we'll send to you after the campaign is over: we'll bring your copy to the con, but we'll still send you the rest of the rewards after the Con.
I got the 'The Early Wizard Gets the Tome/The Tome' perk, but I don’t want to pick it up and it won’t let me select the ‘Shipping’ perk at the same time!
You just have to take one perk first, then open up the campaign page again, and take the other: one after another, not together.
I got the 'The Early Wizard Gets the Tome/The Tome' perk, may I have a drawing on my copy?
We have special perks for full drawing, so to be fair to other backers, we’ll surely make a quick doodle for you in your copy at Lucca/at the presentations in Rome and Milan, but that’s all it’ll be: a quick doodle!

<h3>Greetings!</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I'm Keung Lee! Thanks so much for taking the time to check out my passion project, Battle Maiden Knuckle Bomb! I've been reading both domestic comics and manga since I was young. I now have the opportunity and the time to dedicate to the development of my own comic that blurs the lines between the two styles of comics.</p>
<p>BMKB is a comic harkening back to older comics and manga that I grew up enjoying. <strong>This series will offer some slice of life comedy and drama combined with fast and hard-hitting super-powered martial arts action with a flair of pro wrestling thrown in for good measure!</strong> You'll be introduced to a full cast of characters and exposed to terrifying, monstrous mutations and bioweapons!</p>
<p>This book is intended for YA Readers, young adults ages 13+ as it contains oppai, violence, pantsu, suggestive themes, grotesque mutations, women with curves, use of tobacco, concealed raging boners, <i>more oppai</i>, partial nudity and strong language. Most of these will be featured in issue #1, the others will make their way into the series sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Sword Princess Amaltea är en svensk manga-serie, skapad av Natalia Batista som också skapat serierna Mjau! och Sjöjungfrun Minna.</p>

<p>Serien publicerades mellan 2013-2015 i Sverige och har sedan dess även utkommit i USA, Tyskland, Italien och Tjeckien samt även blivit rollspel!</p>
<p>Serien handlar om prinsessan Amaltea som lever i en matriarkalisk sagovärld. Där är det drottningarna som styr och prinsessorna blir utsända att rädda prinsar i nöd och gifta sig med dem. Amaltea räddar prins Ossian, som dock inte vill vara prins i denna sexistiska värld, och tillsammans får de uppleva äventyr på sin resa tillbaka till hans moders slott. Banditbrudar, en förförisk servitör och en drakridande häxa förföljer dem på deras färd i denna könsomvända fantasyberättelse. Humor, action och äventyr blandas i denna satir över hur vårt eget samhälle behandlar kvinnor och män olika.<br/>Läs några kapitel på engelska här: <a href=""http://www.swordprincessamaltea.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.SwordPrincessAmaltea.com</a></p>

<p>Trilogin Sword Princess Amaltea har i skrivande stund sålt drygt 9000 exemplar, och de senaste upplagorna börjar ta slut. Vi vill fortsätta hålla serien tillgänglig för läsare, för vi har under dessa sex åren sedan första boken kom ut fått se och höra om hur mycket den betyder för läsarna. Denna berättelse som lyfter tjejer och visar hur en värld kan se ut där makten mellan könen är omvänd, har både skapat tankeväckande samtal såväl som inspiration för de unga läsarna att själva skapa världar som bryter mot normer och vad vi är vana vid. Den uppskattas av både vuxna och barn och vi hoppas att med denna samlingsbok nå ut till ännu fler läsare.</p>

Sword Princess Amaltea är en svensk manga-serie, skapad av Natalia Batista som också skapat serierna Mjau! och Sjöjungfrun Minna.

Serien publicerades mellan 2013-2015 i Sverige och har sedan dess även utkommit i USA, Tyskland, Italien och Tjeckien samt även blivit rollspel!
Serien handlar om prinsessan Amaltea som lever i en matriarkalisk sagovärld. Där är det drottningarna som styr och prinsessorna blir utsända att rädda prinsar i nöd och gifta sig med dem. Amaltea räddar prins Ossian, som dock inte vill vara prins i denna sexistiska värld, och tillsammans får de uppleva äventyr på sin resa tillbaka till hans moders slott. Banditbrudar, en förförisk servitör och en drakridande häxa förföljer dem på deras färd i denna könsomvända fantasyberättelse. Humor, action och äventyr blandas i denna satir över hur vårt eget samhälle behandlar kvinnor och män olika.Läs några kapitel på engelska här: www.SwordPrincessAmaltea.com



Det finns även en lärarhandledning för att läsa Sword Princess Amaltea i klassrummet och använda den i undervisningen, skriven av Helga Boström.

Nosebleed Studio är idag Sveriges främsta mangaförlag och mangatecknarstudio. Vi ger ut svenskproducerad manga för unga läsare såväl som läsare av alla åldrar som vill hitta något nytt som inte kommer från Japan. Studion grundades 2006 och förlaget bildades 2011 av oss mangatecknare själva. Idag består den av sex medlemmar:


Natalia Batista, skaparen av Sword Princess Amaltea, Mjau! och Sjöjungfrun Minna.

Magnolia Winroth, skaparen av serien Uriah på WEBTOON.

Joakim Waller, skaparen av serien Penguin Rumble.

Alice Engström, som tecknar hästmanga för serietidningen Min Häst.

Catarina Batista, som tecknat för Folktandvården Skåne.

Elise Rosberg, som skrivit Lär dig teckna manga! - Karaktärsdesign.


Trilogin Sword Princess Amaltea har i skrivande stund sålt drygt 9000 exemplar, och de senaste upplagorna börjar ta slut. Vi vill fortsätta hålla serien tillgänglig för läsare, för vi har under dessa sex åren sedan första boken kom ut fått se och höra om hur mycket den betyder för läsarna. Denna berättelse som lyfter tjejer och visar hur en värld kan se ut där makten mellan könen är omvänd, har både skapat tankeväckande samtal såväl som inspiration för de unga läsarna att själva skapa världar som bryter mot normer och vad vi är vana vid. Den uppskattas av både vuxna och barn och vi hoppas att med denna samlingsbok nå ut till ännu fler läsare.

Våra mål är att:

Trycka en fin hårdpärmsbok som samlar hela serien.
Trycka boken på det miljövänliga tryckeriet Lenanders Grafiska i Kalmar.
Inkludera bonusmaterial om hur Natalia skapade serien, med både text, foton och skisser från arbetsprocessen.
Göra boken så lyxig som möjligt, se Stretch Goals nedan.
Se till att leverera boken till er som stödjer projektet innan 20 december!
Få ut boken i bokhandel och till bibliotek landet över.


Vi i Nosebleed Studio kommer lägga in 80 000 kr själva i detta projekt. Vad vi skulle behöva din hjälp med är de där extra pengarna som behövs för att göra boken extra lyxig. Därför har vi lagt upp en rad Stretch Goals, alltså mål på vägen mot den mest lyxiga bok vi någonsin skapat!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings Indiegogo, let me introduce myself, my name is Ben Lee. I'm a comic creator &amp; publisher here in the heartland of America, and I'm hoping to tell a meaningful story, and I'm hoping you'll help me out!</p>
<p>You can call me a self-publisher, independent publisher, even small press... but however you'd like to call it, I've always noticed that a lot people in this arena always resort to a ""hook"" to gain an audience, usually involving a mass amount of T&amp;A, but usually comes at the sacrifice of the story.</p>
<p>But I don't want to do that, I simply want to tell stories that have an impact. And I'm hoping to can help me get the work out there. </p>
<p>The reason why LOST IN THE MIDDLE is so important to me is because, to put it simply, it's personal. Issue one is out in the world, and this whole concept sprung from a moment of racism in my own life, and from there a very personal story came forth. </p>
<p>And since starting the first issue, I've been committed to seeing this through. Those of you who've read the first issue, I hope you dug it. And if you have, I really think where the story is going will have an impact. At least that's my hope. </p>
<p>And if you haven't read any of LOST IN THE MIDDLE, I do hope you'll give it a try. You can order the first issue <strong><a href=""https://squareup.com/store/bigheadproductions/item/lost-in-the-middle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a></strong>. This really has been a labor of love, and I hope it finds an audience. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So in terms of what I need to raise? Well, that comes to approximately $2000. Now what will that go towards? First and foremost, fulfilling perks. I want to make sure you guys get what I'm promising as a thank you for your support. But the rest? Pretty much accounts for an 800 copy print run, as well as for some light marketing and advertising. </p>
<p>But I'm sure you're wondering what perks are offered? Well, we got comics of course, then signed comics, prints, and pins! I mean, who doesn't love pins?!!! And honestly, I might surprise the backers with anything else I think of before the campaign ends!</p>
<p>Now if I don't reach my goal, like I said earlier, my priority is to fulfill perks. And if anything is left, that will go to publishing the comic. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know not everyone can contribute to campaigns. But at the very least, if you dig this campaign, if I could ask the favor of sharing this with your family and friends would mean so much!</p>
<p>But more than anything, thanks so much for checking this out! I hope you dug it. </p>
<p>— Ben Lee</p>
<p>PS</p>
<p>Thank you so much for visiting! And please remember, EVERY little bit helps. Be it a share, or a $1. It all helps!</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>

Greetings Indiegogo, let me introduce myself, my name is Ben Lee. I'm a comic creator & publisher here in the heartland of America, and I'm hoping to tell a meaningful story, and I'm hoping you'll help me out!
You can call me a self-publisher, independent publisher, even small press... but however you'd like to call it, I've always noticed that a lot people in this arena always resort to a ""hook"" to gain an audience, usually involving a mass amount of T&A, but usually comes at the sacrifice of the story.
But I don't want to do that, I simply want to tell stories that have an impact. And I'm hoping to can help me get the work out there. 
The reason why LOST IN THE MIDDLE is so important to me is because, to put it simply, it's personal. Issue one is out in the world, and this whole concept sprung from a moment of racism in my own life, and from there a very personal story came forth. 
And since starting the first issue, I've been committed to seeing this through. Those of you who've read the first issue, I hope you dug it. And if you have, I really think where the story is going will have an impact. At least that's my hope. 
And if you haven't read any of LOST IN THE MIDDLE, I do hope you'll give it a try. You can order the first issue here. This really has been a labor of love, and I hope it finds an audience. 

What We Need & What You Get
So in terms of what I need to raise? Well, that comes to approximately $2000. Now what will that go towards? First and foremost, fulfilling perks. I want to make sure you guys get what I'm promising as a thank you for your support. But the rest? Pretty much accounts for an 800 copy print run, as well as for some light marketing and advertising. 
But I'm sure you're wondering what perks are offered? Well, we got comics of course, then signed comics, prints, and pins! I mean, who doesn't love pins?!!! And honestly, I might surprise the backers with anything else I think of before the campaign ends!
Now if I don't reach my goal, like I said earlier, my priority is to fulfill perks. And if anything is left, that will go to publishing the comic. 

Other Ways You Can Help
I know not everyone can contribute to campaigns. But at the very least, if you dig this campaign, if I could ask the favor of sharing this with your family and friends would mean so much!
But more than anything, thanks so much for checking this out! I hope you dug it. 
— Ben Lee
PS
Thank you so much for visiting! And please remember, EVERY little bit helps. Be it a share, or a $1. It all helps!
Thank you so much!",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

Each character is designed to not just feel unique to each other but to feel real to readers, to make them think they are actual people because, to an extent, they are! Most of the main cast of characters are based around actual people, often named for them and sharing aspects like similar personalities, similar interests or similar ways of thinking even if their behavior might be different.</p>

<p>The idea of the campaign is to help jump start the comic's production which, not surprisingly, costs a lot of money. While the comic will be produced regardless of the success of this campaign, the pace will be much slower without your support. Every bit of money we raise, after the service fees and reward costs, goes straight to producing pages. Our target goal of $3500 gets the first chapter completed. After that, we need to raise an additional $3500 plus $500 to make each future chapter. This means we'd need a total of $17,000 to complete a full volume.<br/></p>
<p><b>It takes as little as $5. If every person who saw this gave just $5, we'd hit our goal in no time!</b><br/></p>

<b>Q. How often do you plan to release chapters?</b><p>A. That depends on our success here. At the top end, if this campaign is an overwhelming success then we could look into doing up to seven chapters a year along with perhaps one to two chapters of a sidestory. (At 45 pages on average per chapter, this is 360 to 405 pages). However, if the opposite were to happen and we absolutely bomb, we'll likely begin at only one chapter a year. This is the key thing: the more success, both in funding and in exposure, the more we can make not just now but in the future.</p>

</div></div>","Special Announcement!
Our $10 level has been a HUGE hit up here at Emerald City Comic Con, so I wanted to make sure to highlight it right up top here.  For a $10 donation,  you get to suggest ANY line of dialogue, and I will find some way to work it into the strip.  Check the comments section for what some people have come up with so far.
Our Story
Searnold here - writer of ""Behind the Hero"" and now ""Behind the Hero - The Webcomic!""  Along with artist John McDowell we're going to be bringing you a weekly dose of funny with characters that are as silly as they are super.
If you enjoy a good laugh, we'd love your support!
You can see the first 10 strips in the gallery section to get an idea of what ""Behind the Hero"" will look like on the internets.  Plus, if you're not familiar with the characters, you can read the original comic book for FREE on my website:
http://www.SuperSearnold.com/BehindTheHero01.php


The Impact
Want social impact?  They say laughter is the best medicine.  If we raise enough money, we can cure the whole world!


What We Need & What You Get
Creating ""Behind the Hero - The Webcomic"" costs about $10 per strip.  So our goal is to raise $520 in order to create a year's worth of weekly strips.
Of course, if we raise more, we can create more content!
And we'll never leave you empty handed - every donation comes with free prizes!  (Read the right side of the page for details.)
But we're also doing something special: you can buy any level multiple times.  Want to suggest 5 lines of dialogue?  Donate $50 and just mention that you want 5 ""$10 Prizes.""
Want us to turn you AND your best friend into comic book characters?  Donate $100 and get double of EVERY prize!

<h3>Who the heck is this weirdo?</h3>
<p>I'm Hannah Lee Stockdale, and I'm an illustrator from southeast Michigan. I just graduated from college this past May, so in natural post-American college fashion, money is pretty tight for me right now! I love visual storytelling and comics and love meeting people who create just as much. The lousy thing about the midwest is that it's pretty sparse in terms of great opportunities for illustrators and comic folks alike. I rely very heavily on the internet for networking and work, but that can only go so far! Traveling costs a pretty penny, and while I've spent the past few months out of school trying to scrounge up cash through commissions and sending my app to every Staples and Gamestop in metro-Detroit, it hasn't been enough. <img alt=""talking with my 'Tuff Self' comic #2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i44.photobucket.com/albums/f37/HannyBannany/artFART/igg_img1.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Tuff Hannah 2""/></p>
<p>I am hoping to make it out to Bethesda, Maryland in September to attend the Small Press Expo. Getting the chance to connect with people (in real life!) and to share my portfolio of work will help me along in my career exponentially. </p>
<p>My plans are to create a short comic that serves as a sort of intro or ""pilot"" to a longer story I have been planning for a few months now. It's a story about Anita, a jaded girl who's too close to the cusp of adulthood to be considered a teenager anymore, and the secrets she finds in the forest behind her house. Up until now, I've done only comics of the autobiographical variety and I would love to stretch my muscles into new territory! If all goes according to plan, I will have it printed and all primped and pretty to hand out to folks at SPX! (and to the lovely folks who donated but couldn't make it to SPX)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why, you ask? </h3>
<p>The costs will cover travel to and from Maryland, printing of the comic, and other supplies needed for the perk rewards.</p>
<p>I plan on driving to MD from MI, and a <em>rough</em> estimate from <a href=""http://fuelcostcalculator.aaa.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a> tells me that fuel will cost around $130 round trip.  The other costs include hotel fees, money for printing the comic itself, and shipping costs for those with rewards needing that. (the more money I can get, the fancier everything will be!)</p>

<p>Hello, My name is Rob Skiba. I have been a documentary filmmaker since 1994. This has had the effect of making me into a researcher. By that I mean I RE-search that which has already been searched by others before me. It has become a passionate hobby of mine, which has resulted in the development of a web series called SEED. The above trailer is a concept animation for that series, which will be shot in live action. Here is a brief synopsis of this story:</p>
<p><strong>Think: <em>Lost meets Battlestar Galactica, wrapped up in an X-File.</em></strong></p>
<p>In 33A.D., Jesus Christ prophesied that the Last Days would be like the days of Noah.</p>
<p>In December of 2002, an advanced party special operations team was sent to Iraq looking for weapons of mass destruction. But what they found was far worse than any conventional weaponry.</p>
<p>Cpt. Zak Randall and his team inadvertently discover the cave of Dudael and all hell breaks loose. Zak's team gets wiped out, but he survives with the help of a mysterious Bedouin who transports him through time and space from the desert of Iraq in 2002 to the desert of Arizona in 2010.</p>
<p>Zak's quest for answers begins here, at the beginning... of the end.</p>
<h2>Project Status:</h2>
<p>SEED is currently being developed as both a (TV ready) live action web series as well as fictional novel series. Now, we are trying to create it as a <strong>graphic novel</strong> series to go along with it. Part of the reason for this is so that we can use the profits to help completely self-fund the web series. It is essential for us to be self-funded because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Going through a network/studio usually means compromising the vision.</li>
<li>Investors will want to control content.</li>
<li>Networks/studios will censor content.</li>
<li>Networks/studios can cancel a series prematurely and own the rights, which effectively can kill a project.</li>
<li>We have a big vision for 72 episodes, and we are not willing to compromise in order to achieve it. This means we must do everything we can to retain complete creative control.</li>
<li>If you are sick and tired of the same-old, same-old, and hate it when your favorite TV shows keep getting cancelled prematurely (sometimes on a season end cliff-hanger), we are putting the control in you, the audience's hands.</li>
</ul><p>One of the ways we can become both self-funded as well as reach a broader market is through projects like this. Graphic novels and comic books are very popular, even amongst adults. And we've been able to determine that <strong>each 1 hour web series script for SEED will essentially translate to 6 individual comic book issues, which will then get packaged together into a thick graphic novel</strong>. Thus, each episode of SEED will generate 7 products that can be sold in order to help fund the web series as well as get the story out through another popular market.</p>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>We already have enough written content right now to produce 12 comic book issues and two graphic novels, with more written content on the way. Thus, we need your help to raise a <em>minimum</em> of $15,000. This will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enable us to hire the writers, artists and staff needed to do this right.</li>
<li>Enable us to do a limited print run for promotional purposes.</li>
<li>Help us to kick-start the promotions for both the web series as well as the fictional novel series.</li>
</ul><h3>What You Get:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Once the graphic novel is done, anyone who contributes $33 or more will receive a FREE digital copy in PDF format.</li>
<li>People who contribute a minimum of $111 will get the above plus credit on our SEED graphic novel web site (currently in development).</li>
<li>People who contribute a minimum of $222 will get the above plus credit in the graphic novel as well.</li>
<li>People who contribute $444 or more will get the above and also have the option of being drawn into the graphic novel as an ""extra"" in the story.</li>
<li>People who contribute $777 or more will get the above and also have the option of being ""cast"" into the story as a ""bit part"" (short speaking scene).</li>
<li>People who contribute more than $1,000 will get all of the above, plus an autographed hardcopy of the graphic novel.</li>
</ul><p>If we do not reach our entire goal of $15,000, whatever funds we do get will still go toward the development of this comic book series. And to whatever degree we are successful, the above benefits will still apply.</p>
<h3>The Impact:</h3>
<p>SEED is more than just a cool web series, sci-fi novel and comic book idea. SEED is meant to entertain, while at the same time help people learn about the times we are living in and how we are really just repeating ancient history - a history that had terrible consequences. The keys to undertanding the future lie buried in the past. Thus, SEED has the potential to really make an impact on culture by making social, political and religious commentary, wrapped up in an entertaining tale of mystery, intrigue, conspiracy and the supernatural.</p>

<p><span><b>Our story</b></span></p>
<p><span>The Food Chain Workers Alliance is a coalition of worker-based organizations whose members plant, harvest, process, pack, transport, prepare, serve, and sell food, organizing to improve wages and working conditions for all workers along the food chain. The Alliance works together to build a more sustainable food system that respects workers’ rights, based on the principles of social, environmental and racial justice, in which everyone has access to healthy and affordable food.</span></p>
<p>20 million people work in the food system in the U.S., joining millions around the world who labor on farms and in meat, poultry and food processing facilities, warehouses, grocery stores and restaurants. The food system is the largest employer in the U.S. and the majority of frontline food workers earn poverty wages. In the U.S., a third of food workers suffer from food insecurity and hunger.</p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>The members of the Alliance decided to create a comic book focused on food workers in order to illustrate the issues facing these workers, as well as their efforts to organize to improve their workplaces, their communities, and the food system. Luis DeLeon, a restaurant worker and member of the Restaurant Opportunities Center of Chicago, volunteered to write the backstory for the comic book. He created five characters, each representing one of the five main sectors of the food system, and he called them the Food Chain Avengers.</p>
<p><b>The Comic Book</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><span>The Food Chain Avengers comic book uses examples drawn from real experiences by workers in their respective industries, the five main characters of the story walk us through each of five sectors of the food chain: production, processing, distribution, retail, and food service. The comic book exposes the exploitative nature of the industry Vis-à-vis its workers, communities, and the environment. in addition, it tells the story of struggle to victory.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Food Chain Avengers is illustrated and written by artist Jerel Dye. Jerel is an Artist, illustrator, and designer based in Massachusetts.  While in high school he worked as a pizza chef. You can learn more about Jerel's work at <a href=""http://jereldye.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://jereldye.com/blog/</a>.</p>
<p><b>Where you come in</b></p>
<p>We need to raise 10K by Nov 15!  </p>
<p>Your donations will go to supporting the distribution of our comic book and help educate youth about food workers. Youth who participate in our release parties in NYC, Chicago and LA will get free copies of the comic book. We feel its important for youth to have tools to learn who is responsible for the food we eat each day.</p>
<p>We're printing 5,000 English and 1,000 Spanish spanish copies of the comic book. The pdf will be free and downloadable online. Next month we'll start taking orders and are asking for a small suggested donation for a copies of the printed version. That really will barely cover cost to print and it won't really cover shipping and the fee to the artist and writer and FCWA staff time working on it. The total project budget is $23,000.  $10,000 is what we haven't raised yet from other sources.</p>
<p>Your donation ensures that food worker stories are told and that we can come together to support their struggles for change.  You'll be giving a voice to millions of workers who are responsible for the food we eat each day but many times are invisible to us.</p>

</div></div>","Our story
The Food Chain Workers Alliance is a coalition of worker-based organizations whose members plant, harvest, process, pack, transport, prepare, serve, and sell food, organizing to improve wages and working conditions for all workers along the food chain. The Alliance works together to build a more sustainable food system that respects workers’ rights, based on the principles of social, environmental and racial justice, in which everyone has access to healthy and affordable food.
20 million people work in the food system in the U.S., joining millions around the world who labor on farms and in meat, poultry and food processing facilities, warehouses, grocery stores and restaurants. The food system is the largest employer in the U.S. and the majority of frontline food workers earn poverty wages. In the U.S., a third of food workers suffer from food insecurity and hunger.
Background
The members of the Alliance decided to create a comic book focused on food workers in order to illustrate the issues facing these workers, as well as their efforts to organize to improve their workplaces, their communities, and the food system. Luis DeLeon, a restaurant worker and member of the Restaurant Opportunities Center of Chicago, volunteered to write the backstory for the comic book. He created five characters, each representing one of the five main sectors of the food system, and he called them the Food Chain Avengers.
The Comic Book

The Food Chain Avengers comic book uses examples drawn from real experiences by workers in their respective industries, the five main characters of the story walk us through each of five sectors of the food chain: production, processing, distribution, retail, and food service. The comic book exposes the exploitative nature of the industry Vis-à-vis its workers, communities, and the environment. in addition, it tells the story of struggle to victory.

Food Chain Avengers is illustrated and written by artist Jerel Dye. Jerel is an Artist, illustrator, and designer based in Massachusetts.  While in high school he worked as a pizza chef. You can learn more about Jerel's work at http://jereldye.com/blog/.
Where you come in
We need to raise 10K by Nov 15!  
Your donations will go to supporting the distribution of our comic book and help educate youth about food workers. Youth who participate in our release parties in NYC, Chicago and LA will get free copies of the comic book. We feel its important for youth to have tools to learn who is responsible for the food we eat each day.
We're printing 5,000 English and 1,000 Spanish spanish copies of the comic book. The pdf will be free and downloadable online. Next month we'll start taking orders and are asking for a small suggested donation for a copies of the printed version. That really will barely cover cost to print and it won't really cover shipping and the fee to the artist and writer and FCWA staff time working on it. The total project budget is $23,000.  $10,000 is what we haven't raised yet from other sources.
Your donation ensures that food worker stories are told and that we can come together to support their struggles for change.  You'll be giving a voice to millions of workers who are responsible for the food we eat each day but many times are invisible to us.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">WHAT'S AN ACID MONDAY</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>Acid Monday is a boys love webcomic that I started in 2008. I finished it in 2010 and had a small run printed. Now I've completely sold out of books, and due to there still being demand for the comic, I've decided to do a reprint!</p>
<p>If you're new to the Acid Monday, here is a synopsis:</p>
<p></p>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>Before, Clover only knew Monday as the local acid addict. This changes after Clover snaps at him in the boy’s bathroom. As fate would have it, the boy’s mother forces him into a job at her rehab clinic as a mentor for none other than Monday.</i></span><br/><p></p>
<p><i>Is it fate bringing them together or is there some ulterior motive for the acidhead being at the clinic?</i></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>There's an entire new chapter of the book that I made just for this reprint. I'll be posting the first 10 pages up online, but to get the whole 29 page comic, you've gotta buy a pdf or the book! It features Ren and Larxt. Because of REASONS OK. It is 18+. There are peens.</p>
<p>I'll be posting two pages a week--one on Tuesday and one on Friday.</p>
<p>I've also had a killer team to help me with reformatting and relettering the pages for the reprint. While the story remains the same, I've revised some of the dialogue and art. It looks way better now holy cow.</p>
<p>The pdf and book will also include the 13 page extra that was made for the first printing.</p>
<p>SO…18+??</p>
<p>YEAH. You gotta be 18+ to buy this comic, sweeties. Dems da rules. While there isn't much explicit content in the main storyline, both of the extras are pretty gosh darn porn heavy. Also it's gay. But, I'm assuming you've figured it out by this point.</p>
<h3>WHAT'S THE PRINTING PLAN?</h3>
<p>The estimated cost to get this printed is around $2500 or so. I have some money saved up for it, so I'm only setting my goal at $1500. Any additional funds will be used to support future publishing projects by Lucid. There is a direct dollar to gay porn exchange.</p>
<p>The book itself will be 224 pages, offset, perfect bound, 5""x7"", b/w, with a color cover.</p>
<h3>TIMEFRAME</h3>
<p>The book will be going out to print in about 5 weeks. I'll be posting two pages of the extra every week--one on Tuesday and one on Friday while the fundraiser is going. After that, it'll take a few weeks for the printer to do their thing, and another couple weeks for me to sign/sketch in books and ship them out! So you can probably expect your book sometime in November for USA residents, and late November/early December for international residents. This schedule is subject to change, but I will keep you updated throughout the process.</p>
<h3>OOO A CONTEST</h3>
<p>To celebrate the reprint, I'm holding a fanart contest! You'll have the chance to win a copy of the book and be featured in it as well!</p>
<p>There will be a winner and a runner up. The winner will get a drawn in copy of the book, the letter size print, and I'll just throw books and zines at you until I'm satisfied. The runner up will get a signed copy of the book.</p>
<p>Content Requirements: Must be Acid Monday related! That's about it. Comics? Yes plz. Illustrations? Aww yeah. It can be 18+, funny, serious??, whatever! Though if you do a comic, please keep it 2 pages or under.</p>

We had mutual friends who got me in contact with her and she DID say yes, with the caveat, “I usually don’t do these things.” </p>
<p>Marcia Wallace did me a gigantic favor by saying yes to being in “Vampire Mob.”  Then she said yes, again, and we made season two of “Vampire Mob.” </p>
<p>I wrote a third season with Marcia’s character all over the script and she was on board to reprise her role. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, on October 25, 2013 the world got less funny when Marcia Wallace died. </p><p></p><p><b>""Improvise, adapt and overcome."" </b></p><p></p>

<p>I wanted to continue telling the story of “Vampire Mob,” it’s a really funny script!  But without Marcia, how? </p>

<p></p></div>","To see the progress of Vampire Mob - Issue 1, drop by VampireMob.comThank YOU for making it possible for Vampire Mob to continue! I can't wait to tell you more of this story and I'm psyched to spend more time with these characters in this world.                                                                              Vampire Mob, Issue 1 - Cover by JM Ringuet.My name is Joe Wilson and I tell stories with the help of people located all over the world.                                               One of these stories. ""Vampire Mob,"" started four years ago and I was hoping to tell more of it.I tried to find a way to tell this story without asking for help from you, the audience, which resulted in taking a lot of meetings with companies and doing a lot of waiting.
Because I made the mistake of not taking that same time to raise the budget independently, that story can no longer be told, at least not the way I had hoped. 
The biggest lesson I learned making Vampire Mob was DON'T WAIT FOR SOMEONE TO PICK YOU. If you're reading this, whatever it is you want to do in life, START NOW. DO NOT WAIT.                        Marcia Wallace as a vampire?
I watched a lot of reruns of “The Bob Newhart Show” as a kid and was always a fan of Marcia’s work. You may know her voice as Edna Krabappel on ""The Simpsons.""                Marcia Wallace and the character she made so memorable!I created a character for Marcia Wallace, without her knowing it.I loved hearing Marcia's voice in my head as I typed dialogue for Virginia Jones, I didn't know if Marcia would say yes because I didn't know Marcia. 
We had mutual friends who got me in contact with her and she DID say yes, with the caveat, “I usually don’t do these things.” 
Marcia Wallace did me a gigantic favor by saying yes to being in “Vampire Mob.”  Then she said yes, again, and we made season two of “Vampire Mob.” 
I wrote a third season with Marcia’s character all over the script and she was on board to reprise her role. 
Unfortunately, on October 25, 2013 the world got less funny when Marcia Wallace died. ""Improvise, adapt and overcome."" 

Recasting Virginia just didn’t feel right. 
I wanted to continue telling the story of “Vampire Mob,” it’s a really funny script!  But without Marcia, how? 
Creating “Vampire Mob” as a graphic novel would allow Marcia’s character to be “alive” in our imaginations.
We could all imagine Marcia Wallace saying the words on the page and that did feel right.                                 Vampire Mob - Issue 1 




The live-action script for VMob season three is twice as long as seasons 1 and 2, combined! The goal with the S3 script was to pick up the story a few days after the kitchen scene in season two. Vampire Mob Issue 1 will have a color cover and be approximately 28-30 black and white pages, with the possibility of a few extra pages if we reach stretch goals.       Adapting the entire VMob S3 live-action script into a graphic-novel script will result in 7 individual issues of the graphic novel.  PLEASE NOTE: VAMPIRE MOB has adult language (F-Carpet Bombs) meant for adults in both the live-action version and in the graphic novel version.                                         Get drawn as a VAMPIRE!                                         Supporting Mob member Larry Fleming with his perk!JM Ringuet will draw YOU as a vampire grocery shopping in the Mustang with Don!I'll send you the extremely high quality file and you can post it, print it, or both!  I only have a handful of these posters and they are the last that will be printed.                                                          ""We are all famous to a few people,"" the mug!!                  Mama Giacomina's Polpette (meatball) recipe, contributed by Darlene Vendegna!

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Summary</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>""<i>Prussians Vs Aliens</i>"" is a humorous steampunk comic book written by Davide La Rosa, drawn by Riccardo Pieruccini and colored by Luca Salce and Mattia Zoanni.</p>
<p>The goal here is to give life to a new comic book series which could take the reader to a universe filled with steampunk robots and funny aliens.</p>
<p>In these pages, a historically revised Prussian army has to fight the menace coming from outer space. They'll be able to engage aliens with the help of a special task force, featuring six war heroes and their own huge steampunk robots: levers, pedals, chains, belts and steamy gears are going to be all over the place! </p>
<p>The story is heavily inspired by Japanese anime's from the '70-'80s. If you enjoyed shows such as Mazinger, Grendizer or Daitan III or even Pacific Rim or Michael Bay's Transformers, this is going to be a real eye-candy for you! It's a huge quotes goldmine that will amuse and excite you from the beginning straight to the end.</p>

<h3>The Plot</h3>
<p>It's 1789. French Revolution is raging in the streets of Paris. </p>
<p>No one cared to notice that the Prussians were busy fighting an alien menace and saving the world. But let's step back for a minute. </p>
<p>A few weeks earlier, the fat King Frederick William II was experiencing the worst awakening of his life. Rumor has it, the whole Prussian horse fleet had disappeared. It couldn't get any worse for a country whose greatest army pride are the horses! <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">After all, what's left of a XVIII Century army if you take the horses away from them?!</span></p><p>Who took them away? <br/>Who could steal all of the animals in just one night without anyone noticing?! </p>
<p>Intelligence agencies didn't take too long to discover that the culprit came from the sky. The kidnappers are the ruthless aliens coming straight from the moon! </p>
<p>The horses had to be retrieved ASAP, no matter what. Yes, but how?! Now, the Prussians had a special army, a secret task force of six ruthless fighters, three men and three women. The best of the best of the Prussian Kingdom's army. </p>
<p>Each of these agents will drive their own robot. Will the Prussians be able to ward off the alien threat?</p>

<br/></div>","Summary

""Prussians Vs Aliens"" is a humorous steampunk comic book written by Davide La Rosa, drawn by Riccardo Pieruccini and colored by Luca Salce and Mattia Zoanni.
The goal here is to give life to a new comic book series which could take the reader to a universe filled with steampunk robots and funny aliens.
In these pages, a historically revised Prussian army has to fight the menace coming from outer space. They'll be able to engage aliens with the help of a special task force, featuring six war heroes and their own huge steampunk robots: levers, pedals, chains, belts and steamy gears are going to be all over the place! 
The story is heavily inspired by Japanese anime's from the '70-'80s. If you enjoyed shows such as Mazinger, Grendizer or Daitan III or even Pacific Rim or Michael Bay's Transformers, this is going to be a real eye-candy for you! It's a huge quotes goldmine that will amuse and excite you from the beginning straight to the end.
The first chapter of the saga will be issued in 

two volumes
Colored
B5 format 

46 pages per volume. 


At the moment, just the first volume will be available in the crowdfunding campaign. However, if the campaign grows well, generous rewards will be added along the way.
The Plot
It's 1789. French Revolution is raging in the streets of Paris. 
No one cared to notice that the Prussians were busy fighting an alien menace and saving the world. But let's step back for a minute. 
A few weeks earlier, the fat King Frederick William II was experiencing the worst awakening of his life. Rumor has it, the whole Prussian horse fleet had disappeared. It couldn't get any worse for a country whose greatest army pride are the horses! After all, what's left of a XVIII Century army if you take the horses away from them?!Who took them away? Who could steal all of the animals in just one night without anyone noticing?! 
Intelligence agencies didn't take too long to discover that the culprit came from the sky. The kidnappers are the ruthless aliens coming straight from the moon! 
The horses had to be retrieved ASAP, no matter what. Yes, but how?! Now, the Prussians had a special army, a secret task force of six ruthless fighters, three men and three women. The best of the best of the Prussian Kingdom's army. 
Each of these agents will drive their own robot. Will the Prussians be able to ward off the alien threat?

We've hit some unexpected snags here at the end of the production of the new ""HEROBEAR and the Kid "" HARDCOVER BOOK. . . with the tremendous increase in costs and materials . . .  it has increased in cost by almost 35%. The book has grown by nearly 200 pages(awesome), but there are extra tariff costs now, shipping fees have gone up, and elevated material costs that have unexpectedly hit us hard as we are trying to finish the project.(not so awesome).  
So, we're trying to work it all out and get to the final finish line of this project. 
And we could use a little bit of help. That's why this lil' campaign exists. 
____________________________

The Goal of this campaign.
We are hoping to raise 1k-5k or more to help with the extra unexpected costs we are encountering.
This funding will go to finishing the print production, which includes more pages and material cost increases.   And it will help to alleviate the added tariff expenses that have been added to our production.   Also, it will help with upcoming shipping costs which have increased. 
___________________________Special PERKS.


To thank everyone for contributing to this fundraiser, we are offering a Special thank-you gifts.  The MAIN PERK is a poster print of the inside cover illustration of the hard cover book.   
 
___________________________Add-Ons
Also, backers are able to add-on some EXTRA SPECIAL ADD-ONS toooo . . . such as a Herobear Trading Card featuring Herobear,  a special limited ink scribble Batman print.  AND you can even get an original Herobear pencil head sketch added on. 

________________________________________
Check them all out in the perks over on the side and then once you pick a perk, you can add-on the extras----->.
________________________________________

Your Amazing Help.
This is a voluntary fundraiser.  It isn't a prerequisite for original backers to get their original pledges/rewards of the Hard Cover.  But . . . every little bit helps in the production/costs and we thank you for considering this and for helping in whatever way you can.  You are all amazing and we so appreciate your time in visiting and considering this campaign.  


 
Risks & Challenges
We know the challenge is to raise awareness for extra funding for an existing project. We want to thank everyone for considering this campaign and are so appreciative of the encouragement.  We hope to provide an opportunity for fans to join in to help smooth the project over the finish line.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p class=""p2""><span class=""s1"">I wrote E.A.R.S. originally as an original screenplay with visions of Pixar, Dreamworks and Sony dancing in my head, but one day recently I asked myself, ""what if?""  The lack of thrilling adventure stories with original characters for today's children has sparked in me a passion to bring this project to the world, and comic books is the perfect medium wherein to make its debut.  When I was a child there were brand new properties popping up left and right.  Today however all we have are 20-30 year old revamps and reiterations of the same IPs we had as children.  E.A.R.S. is new and it's bold and fresh and smart and designed to capture the imagination of not just a new generation, but also those like myself who miss the days when adventure stories were the rule, not the exception.</span></p>

E.A.R.S. (Emergency Action Response Squads) is a thrilling family adventure in which a secret organization hidden beneath the world's most famous and magical theme park must resurrect itself to save the planet.
In 1955, Xavier Milton, founder of E.A.R.S. and creator and architect of the park, sends E.A.R.S. agent Bartholomew Chavez on a mission to hide a device from their arch enemies, the evil S.H.A.D.O. organization.  It was a mission from which Chavez would never return.  Years later, a new generation of E.A.R.S agents have come under attack and are defeated, leaving the world’s last hope in the hands of children; the family members of today's captured E.A.R.S. agents.
From the jungles of the Amazon to the highest peaks of the Himalayas and all the way into Outer Space, six children must unravel a set of cryptic clues over 50 years old as they race to find the key to the mysterious “Midas Touch” and in the process save the world. 
...and there's even a Yeti.
 
The Skinny
I wrote E.A.R.S. originally as an original screenplay with visions of Pixar, Dreamworks and Sony dancing in my head, but one day recently I asked myself, ""what if?""  The lack of thrilling adventure stories with original characters for today's children has sparked in me a passion to bring this project to the world, and comic books is the perfect medium wherein to make its debut.  When I was a child there were brand new properties popping up left and right.  Today however all we have are 20-30 year old revamps and reiterations of the same IPs we had as children.  E.A.R.S. is new and it's bold and fresh and smart and designed to capture the imagination of not just a new generation, but also those like myself who miss the days when adventure stories were the rule, not the exception.


 
 
 
 
 
 
E.A.R.S. is fun and has heart and will leave you both breathless and wantingmore by the time all is said and done with our initial adventure.  And you dear reader can make it happen.
 
Lend me your E.A.R.S.
With this campaign we are looking to fund the production of a full 112- page graphic novel chronicling the E.A.R.S. team's inaugural adventure.  Your generous contributions will help pay our artist and production team as well as launch the title via iTunes, Amazon, and other outlets both in print and digital.
Every little bit we receive will get us closer to realizing this wonderful tale whose message was crafted to empower children to not only believe in themselves, but also to believe they can make a difference.
In a world that is often crazy and can be a bit too much to take, who doesn't want that for their family?
We are running a simple ""No Muss No Fuss"" campaign for E.A.R.S. with three simple tiers.
$20 gets you a digital copy of the graphic novel, along with a digital copy of the original E.A.R.S. screenplay.  Great to read on your Apple, Android, or Amazon touchpad.
$35 gets you a Indiegogo exclusive original cover, softcover edition of E.A.R.S. signed by the writer and artist along with a digital copy of the original E.A.R.S. screenplay.
$50 gets you an Indiegogo exclusive original cover signed by the writer and artist alone with a digital copy of the original E.A.R.S. screenplay.
Each hard and soft cover print copy will be a limited edition and only available via this campaign.  Once they are done we will never print these covers again.
How's that for collectable?  Back us now if you want to make this happen!

<h3>About me and Mikenesses</h3>
<p>I'm an illustrator living in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. I've been drawing comics for years (True Story, Shenanigans for Oni Press). Last October, I drew myself in the style of Bob's Burgers (one of my favorite shows). The next day, I did Home Movies, the day after that Clone High, and then Chuck Jones and Tintin and Frank Miller and it just took off from there. To date, I've drawn myself in 93 distinct styles.</p>

<h3>Are you broke?</h3>
Yeah, I'm like that too sometimes. But if you like the idea, or have seen some of my work and liked it, but just don't have the funds to help out, would it be cool to help me spread the word on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and other social media things? That would be worth so much to me. Thanks!</div></div>","About me and Mikenesses
I'm an illustrator living in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. I've been drawing comics for years (True Story, Shenanigans for Oni Press). Last October, I drew myself in the style of Bob's Burgers (one of my favorite shows). The next day, I did Home Movies, the day after that Clone High, and then Chuck Jones and Tintin and Frank Miller and it just took off from there. To date, I've drawn myself in 93 distinct styles.

<p><strong>Hello my friends!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Let me formally introduce my self! My name is Triston Milton, and I'm a muslim political/ social ficton writer from Minnesota going by the pen name BJK Milton. While i'm currently working on ""The Diary of K."" Series, a series which details the political schemes that will lead to a war between two powerful empires, and the major players that will lead the charge on the both sides. <br/>I'm also a essays and short stories writer, I have always had a love for political satire and graphic novels. </p>
<p>I was born and raised in Saint Paul Minnesota, and have always found a fascination with conficting with the stereotype that we place upon other's and ourselves. This idea and combined with my own personal experiences with the stereotype of being both african american and muslim has sparked and fueled my desire to write political fiction that shows and compares the stereotypes of humanity with the true person.</p>
<p>I write with the ideology of the 10% rule. This rule being that 10% of humanity fit into the stereotype, and 90% fight everyday to prove that stereoptype wrong. And it isn't just one race, religion or people that goes through this, its all people that face this challenge. This brings me the creative spur to write the type of free flowing, some what witty fiction that I write.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Diary of K.: The Book of Gardenia</strong></h2>
<p>This current project that I'm working on is the first in a three part series know as <strong>the Diary of K. </strong>The <strong>Book of Gardenia </strong>is a fictional diary following <span>Kimera, a girl who seems fixed on following in her father's footsteps. Over the course of the story, her journies and trials that will turn her from a young niave child, to a major player in the war, as well as the people who inspired, challenge, and guide her along the way.</span></p>
<p><span>The project has many themes that hit close to home for me, as it will for others. The idea of the political moves made within this alternate world shows  us as human beings how certain events, though small and insignificant to us, can come back to effect us in the future. It also brings light to many stereotypes and views and how these things can blind us to the wonderous possibilities. For example, in the story, Kimera's missunderstanding with various side characters bring about a closed view of them. But as her eyes begin to open up the wonderous world around her, alliances and rivalries change her into the great leader she will become. </span></p>
<p><span>A third theme that hits home to me is the fact that Kimera, through her actions becomes submerged into a somewhat muslim world, where she actually learns things that shift her ideology. I personally can relate to this because prior to converting to islam, I knew absolutly nothing about it. But interactions, just like Kimera, shifted my perspective and opened doors for me, and her that were not there before. And the best part,I, like the main character Kimera, learned from them. </span></p>
<h2>What will be Achieved</h2>
<p>Through this project I wish to do to things with it and these things can not be achieved without the aid of you. </p>
<h3>Open your eyes</h3>
<p>With this project I wish to conflict various stereotypes that affect people who are like me, where ever there from. To bring this conflict and bring to the light things and information that may not be accessible to others. It is good to bring interest and desire to become informed to an audience. I wish to do this without conflicting with the audience in any way. I wish to enlighten in a way that is entertaining at the same time. With this book, along with the entire Diary of K. Series, I wish to this.</p>
<h3>Behind the War</h3>
<p>With the entire Diary of K. Series I wish to show the people behind the wars, and how it effects the people who maybe in the thick of it. We sometimes don't think of the effects a certain decision has on people on the outside of our own circle. With this fictional book I wish to only show the affects of character's decisions on the other people. THis is why I decided to right this as a Character Driven fictional diary. This allows me to bring various decisions closer to each other and there Affects without conflicting with the norms of society. </p>
<p>The Diary of K. Book of Gardenia follows Kimera (whose reall name in the story is Kristopher Wells) from her childhood through her teen years as she becomes more submerged in the lives of others, to her adult year where she learns what it takes to be a great and loved leader. </p>

These funds will allow us his undivided attention and time to flush out the illustration to bring the story to life infront of your eyes.

Perhaps you can stop at a motel and get a few hours before heading on with your journey.  It beckons to you. Inviting you. Lulling you towards it. But the closer you get, the more you feel it. The chill. The stillness. But more than anything, you feel the darkness. It begins to surround you, like it can see every bad thought you’ve ever had.

<p>Founded in the early 1800s, something dark has plagued the town of Black Hollow since its inception, crawling its way into its darkest residents and terrorizing its most helpless. By daylight, the town is a quaint portrait of small-town Canadian life, full of wonders, good people, young love, and even a growing art scene. But in the unforgiving night, it is a place of damnation that encourages evil to flourish in the most unexpected of places.</p>
<p>Spanning different eras of the town’s storied individuals, the series will explore the creeping dread buried at the heart of every small community. Ancient grudges, curses, deals with the devil, and the blank-eyed stares of doppelgangers spoken of only in whispers as “the hollows”; these are but some of the many tales hidden in the shadows of Black Hollow, Ontario.</p>

<h3>The Infection...</h3>
<p>My name is Raymond Dowaliby and I am the founder of Angry Art Press and the Creator/Writer of DEAD MOON.  After founding SCARS Magazine in 2005(a Horror Entertainment Publication) I realized I needed to tell stories and what better way than through comics?  I came up with the concept of DEAD MOON and began writing...I knew what I wanted and I also knew I wanted to be part of a Killer team so I began assembling a Horror Comic Dream Team.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Assisting with the writing chores is <b>Tom Towles</b>(Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer, House Of A Thousand Corpses) and <b>Jason Craig</b>(Freddy VS Jason VS Ash).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With the writing firmly in place, the art had to just right.  <b>Daniel Campos</b>(KISS 4K) is penciling the mini series while I'm proud to introduce <b>Lee Roy Lopez </b>on pencils for DEAD MOON: In the Beginning and <b>Renzo</b> supplying us with our first killer cover!.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Adam Braun</b>(Razor) is a driving force when it comes to inks and creation!  He will be helming VAMPORIA under the Angry Art flag as well as giving life in the way of inks to DEAD MOON.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Gia Nova</b>(Playboy, Rob Zombie's Halloween 2) dons the costume and brings Lucine to life!  Her haunting beauty and keen sense of marketing are what make this character what it is.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With your help we can achieve comic greatness!  Our only limits are our own imaginations and judging by what has come out so far the limits will be few and we will provide you with great entertainment!</p>

</div></div>","The Infection...
My name is Raymond Dowaliby and I am the founder of Angry Art Press and the Creator/Writer of DEAD MOON.  After founding SCARS Magazine in 2005(a Horror Entertainment Publication) I realized I needed to tell stories and what better way than through comics?  I came up with the concept of DEAD MOON and began writing...I knew what I wanted and I also knew I wanted to be part of a Killer team so I began assembling a Horror Comic Dream Team.

Assisting with the writing chores is Tom Towles(Henry Portrait Of A Serial Killer, House Of A Thousand Corpses) and Jason Craig(Freddy VS Jason VS Ash).

With the writing firmly in place, the art had to just right.  Daniel Campos(KISS 4K) is penciling the mini series while I'm proud to introduce Lee Roy Lopez on pencils for DEAD MOON: In the Beginning and Renzo supplying us with our first killer cover!.

Adam Braun(Razor) is a driving force when it comes to inks and creation!  He will be helming VAMPORIA under the Angry Art flag as well as giving life in the way of inks to DEAD MOON.

Gia Nova(Playboy, Rob Zombie's Halloween 2) dons the costume and brings Lucine to life!  Her haunting beauty and keen sense of marketing are what make this character what it is.

With your help we can achieve comic greatness!  Our only limits are our own imaginations and judging by what has come out so far the limits will be few and we will provide you with great entertainment!





DEAD MOON
Dead Moon centers around female protagonist, ""Lucine."" A former operative for the Armenian Resistance: a notoriously savage gun and money runner for the underground's fight against the violent  Turkish regime. Known in covert circles as ""The American Fixer.""
Lucine conquered an aggressive form of breast cancer as an unwitting guinea pig for a radical new form of chemotherapy developed by doctor Todesengel in Germany. Dr. Todesengel is none other than the grandson of the infamous Dr. Josef Mengele (AKA ""The Angel of Death,"" so named for his fondness for torturous experiments inflicted on Jews during the Holocaust.) During this harrowing treatment, he also ensured that Lucine would be host for a vaccine he has been testing for decades.
Todesengel is also responsible for the creation of 90% of the world's pharmaceutical supply. Ultimately devising a plan to combine his pharmaceuticals with ""The Catalyst"" and contaminate the water supply in every major city. The result is a zombie apocalypse, re-animating the recently dead who in turn infect victims via blood-thirsty bites. Lucine stumbles upon a group of 6 survivors she reluctantly allows to come along in their fight to survive. What Todesengel never anticipated was Lucine ingesting his other assorted drug concoctions by way of exposure to zombie flesh.
This transforms Lucine into the first Zombie/Human hybrid and with this discovery comes power and drawbacks. She will attempt to comprehend her neo-biological origins and battle her way to a vaccine -- losing friends, family and a part of her own humanity -- along the way.
DEAD MOON: In The Beginning, introduces you to Lucine by showing how she dealt with her beginning before the harkening of the end.

<p><br/>Part of the fun of going to see movies in the theater is seeing the trailers before. If you’re a geek like me (odds are good you are if you’re reading this) you experience a heady thrill seeing the POTENTIAL of a great movie. You poured over the Dark Knight Rises trailer figuring out the plot. You’re pulse quickens when Gollum is revealed in The Hobbit trailer. Maybe you even get a smidge watery eyed when the Wreck-It Ralph trailer plays (I don’t know why but I always get a tiny bit choked up during animation trailers).<br/>Then there are the OTHER trailers.<br/>Stuff like whatever the newest Michael Bay assault on your senses is or that movie you haven’t heard about even on the newsfeeds which looks…Meh. Or a trailer for a movie that looks so cliché ridden and by the numbers that you wouldn’t see it unless it’s in late August and you need air-conditioning for two hours.<br/>The trailer that has the ad line “From the studio that brought you…”</p>
<p><br/>The trailer that proudly announces a mid-Febuary premier.</p>
<p><br/>The trailer that has Alan Rickman or Sean Bean playing the bad guy.</p>
<p><br/>A trailer like “Shambling Heat”.</p>
<p><br/>Shambling Heat is a one shot comic book gleefully sending up/paying homage to the big dumb high concept action movies we’re all guilty of seeing. But doing it as the trailer for the big dumb high concept action movie, MPAA rating title card, studio logos and exploding Ice cream trucks included!<br/>The story is about tough, play by his own rules, LA supercop Det. Lance Hunter becoming a zombie. He slowly regains his humanity while he and his lady’s man, fast talking black partner Lincoln Washington try and take down evil drug lord with a high society veneer Garrison Cain. Hilarity and zombie carnage ensue.<br/>Oh yeah, it’s also a zombie parody; two for the price of one.</p>
