È anche un'arteterapeuta.I suoi lavori sono una continua sperimentazione di forme, tecniche, materiali in libero dialogo.Su di sé scrive: «Sono da sempre impegnata in un'attenta ricerca nel campo del disegno astratto e delle figure surreali, per soddisfare l'urgenza di una sperimentazione artistica continua, per il raggiungimento di un più completa conoscenza di me stessa».Artista #6 > Tatiana MinelliLa fotografa Tatiana Minelli viene dalla provincia di Perugia.È un'autodidatta di grande talento, che con i suoi ritratti dimostra di saper cogliere la bellezza unica e irruente di volti e corpi non convenzionali.Su di sé scrive: «Amo mostrare ciò che altri non vedono o non vorrebbero vedere, tirare fuori parti ""nascoste"" di chi fotografo anche a costo di non piacere. Preferisco che qualcuno si giri dall'altra parte vedendo una mia foto, piuttosto che la ignori del tutto. Perché per me le foto devono far scaturire emozioni, belle o brutte che siano».Artista #7 > Chiara LombardiChiara Lombardi è una fotografa campana, laureata in Fotografia presso la Rome University of Fine Arts (RUFA). Attualmente studia a Torino, presso l'Accademia Albertina.Le sue visioni giocano con corpi e forme, trame e punti di vista, alla ricerca di un Sensibile nascosto, che emerge da inedite fusioni.Su di sé scrive: «Le mie sono visioni che fondono corpi, scrutano la pelle, accarezzano fugaci emozioni: sono racconti eleganti di intimità nascoste, gestualità accennate e sempre delicate».Artista #8 > Michele LapiniMichele Lapini vive a Bologna e nella vita fa il fotogiornalista. È laureato in Sviluppo Economico e Cooperazione Internazionale, ma è da autodidatta che ha appreso i segreti dello scatto perfetto.Particolarmente interessato alle questioni sociali, politiche e ambientali, nel tempo ha catturato tantissimi volti tra manifestanti e politici, lavoratori e personaggi pubblici, ma anche scorci di vita quotidiana.Su di sé scrive: «Cerco di documentare le realtà del presente, osservando le tante contraddizioni dei nostri tempi, restituendo immagini che possano far riflettere e agire. La fotografia non è mai neutra e in questo sta la responsabilità dei fotogiornalisti. C'è una citazione di Abbas Attar che amo molto: “We photojournalist are not changing the world. All we can do is show why this world has to change, sometime”».Artista #9 > Dayana MontesanoLa romana Dayana Montesano è una fotografa, classe 1985. Tra il 2014 e il 2016 ha frequestato i corsi di Ricerca personale e creativa e di Nudo fotografico presso la Scuola Romana di Fotografia.Ossessionata dal sogno e l'inconscio, Dayana esplora questei aspetti attraverso la psicoanalisi, per capire meglio se stessa e il mondo che la circonda.Su di sé scrive: «Quello che rappresento nelle mie fotografie è un mondo invisibile all'occhio. Questo accade suppongo per la mia tendenza a rifiutare la realtà così com’è. Tendo a manipolarla finché non diventa interessante, accettabile, piacevole ai miei occhi. Ho creato un piccolo universo illuminato, dove non esiste il nero e niente si nasconde nell’ombra».Dove e quando si terrà l'evento?La mostra verrà inaugurata il 1 febbraio 2019 negli spazi del Latte Creative Coworking, nel quartiere Testaccio di Roma, dove rimarrà allestita fino alla fine del mese.Il Latte Creative Coworking è uno spazio minimale e accogliente, con una splendida terrazza che affaccia sull'area antistante al Mattatoio di Roma.All'interno degli spazi del coworking, durante l'inaugurazione, le opere tracceranno solo l'inizio di un percorso fatto di idee, immagini e voci e che accompagnerà il visitatore dal corridoio d'ingresso fino alla ricompensa finale: la meravigliosa vista su Monte Testaccio!Ad aiutarci nel tracciare questo percorso sarà la giovanissima curatrice della mostra, Yasmin Riyahi. Laureata con lode in Studi Storico-Artistici, è prossima alla laurea in Storia dell'Arte e frequenta il master in Economia e Management dell'Arte e dei Beni Culturali presso Il Sole24Ore Business School. L'esposizione si avvarrà del suo sguardo esperto!Come verranno utilizzati i fondi?I fondi raccolti dalla campagna verranno, orientativamente, così ripartiti:

€ 1000,00 per la stampa di opere, cornici e cartoline.

€ 500,00 per il catering, offerto da Hummustown!

€ 300,00 per rimborsare il viaggio agli artisti presenti all'inaugurazione.

€ 200,00 per le tasse della piattaforma e sulle transazioni.
E se raccoglieremo di più?Raccogliere di più sarebbe un sogno! Ci permetterebbe infatti di:
avere un catering più ricco (con più cibo, vino e prosecco per tutti!).
investire sulla pubblicità dell'evento.
recuperare il costo di registrazione della neonata Associazione Culturale.
avere un fondo cassa utile a organizzare altri eventi in futuro e, più in generale, per finanziare le attività dell'associazione.
In particolare, ci piacerebbe molto investire di più nella collaborazione con il catering Hummustown, un progetto etico che desideriamo tantissimo sostenere!Cos'è Hummustown?Hummustown è un servizio di catering gestito da rifugiati siriani.Lo scopo di Hummustown è permettere ai rifugiati di essere economicamente indipendenti e integrarsi nella vita romana, offrendo la loro cucina tradizionale. A loro è quindi data l'opportunità di cucinare e distribuire delizioso cibo siriano in tutta la capitale.Hummustown, infatti, dà ai rifugiati siriani una possibilità, anziché carità, aiutandoli a integrarsi in un Paese con una lingua e una cultura diverse da quelle di origine e in cui spesso arrivano da soli, non potendo quindi contare sul supporto di nessuno.Questi fattori sono un ostacolo nella ricerca di un impiego. Molte delle persone che oggi si impegnano nel catering hanno trovato in Hummustown la loro prima occasione di lavorare in Italia!La tessera associativaSottoscrivendo la tessera associativa di Parte del discorso, puoi avere diritto a una serie di convenzioni commerciali che, in qualità di associazione, stiamo via via stipulando.La tessera associativa 2019, sottoscrivibile a € 15,00, sarà disponibile in esclusiva per questa campagna di crowdfunding al prezzo di € 10,00!Un ampio numero di soci ci permetterà, durante l'anno, di ottenere convenzioni sempre più numerose e vantaggiose per i nostri tesserati.Sveleremo durante la campagna chi sono i nostri primi partner!Le cartolinePer finanziare l'evento e l'associazione, realizzeremo delle cartoline in nove varianti, una per ogni artista coinvolto nell'evento.Sul fronte delle cartoline saranno riprodotte nove tra le opere esposte, mentre il retro presenterà il classico aspetto di una cartolina, con in più un collegamento al nostro sito. Spedirle ai vostri cari, quindi, non sarebbe una cattiva idea!Sarà possibile acquistare delle copie delle cartoline anche durante l'evento.Le opere esposte, in prevendita per IndiegogoDurante la mostra saranno esposte 37 opere.Si tratta prevalentemente di stampe fine art con cornici realizzate a mano e su misura, nel numero di quattro per ogni artista.Fanno eccezione quattro lavori di Lucia Schettino, che sono invece piastre in resina e materiali misti, parte della collezione Expello dell'artista, che verranno esposte accanto alla copia di uno dei suoi lavori, appartenente alla stessa serie.Per acquistarle, seleziona l'apposito perk, indicando artista e numero dell'opera!",27.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I’m building <strong>The Feely Human Collective</strong> to be a safe, cozy sloth-hug of a space for celebrating the wonders of leading with <i>and</i> opening up our hearts, being curious about our <strong>emotions</strong>, engaging in the <strong>vulnerabilit</strong>y that heals, and embracing the <strong>empathy</strong> that brings us all together.</p>
<p>But it’s not going to happen overnight, and it will take a lot of effort as well as your support.</p>
<p><u>The Feely Human Collective will consist of three distinct phases:</u></p>
<p><strong>1. PHASE 1 - FOUNDATION:</strong></p>
<p>In Phase 1, The Feely Human Collective will build the <strong>foundation</strong> of a community that values empathy, vulnerability, and emotional wayfinding—a collective of feely humans coming together and contributing their hearts by way of <strong>writing for the FHC journal</strong>, sharing stories on the new <strong>Feely Human Friday episode</strong> of the You, Me, Empathy podcast, leading free and paid <strong>online workshops</strong> to educate our communities, and <strong>designing art and illustration</strong> to sell in the FHC shop.</p>
<p><strong>2. PHASE 2 - STRENGTHEN:</strong></p>
<p>Phase 2 of The Feely Human Collective is about <strong>strengthening</strong> our foundation. We achieve this by building out a backlog of amazing journal content, workshops, and designs for new products. This is possible only by collaborating with other feely humans who are willing to share their ideas in a workshop, share their designs for our shop, and share their stories in our journal and podcast. That's the beautiful <strong>collaborative</strong> quality of The Feely Human Collective!</p>
<p><strong>3. PHASE 3 - GROWTH:</strong></p>
<p>In Phase 3, my aim is to bring The Feely Human Collective into the offline world by offering <strong>in-person workshops</strong> within brick-and-mortar businesses, schools (universities and primary/secondary schools), developing a <strong>peer-to-peer program</strong>, creating empathy-focused <strong>educational toolkits</strong> for children, hosting a quarterly live empathy-focused <strong>storytelling series</strong>, hosting <strong>retreats</strong> around the world, and launching a <strong>subscription box</strong> filled with fun games and exercises to develop empathy, vulnerability, and emotional wayfinding superpowers.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET:</h3>
<p>My financial goal for this crowdfunding campaign is <strong>$20,000</strong>, which will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$8,000:</strong> Offsetting costs of product design and manufacturing pre-launch as well as allow me to invest back into the product line by developing new products for the future.</li>
<li>
<strong>$4,000:</strong> Developing workshop content, create opportunity to pay workshop leaders, and invest in course-specific software.</li>
<li>
<strong>$3,000: </strong>Product fulfillment (packaging, shipping, etc.)</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,500:</strong> Offset increase in podcast hosting fees (with Feely Human Friday podcast episode being added each week).</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,500:</strong> Hiring support in the areas of admin, social media, email, etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,000:</strong> Website maintenance, SEO, email, file storage, etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,000:</strong> Indiegogo fees, miscellaneous, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>THE REWARDS:</strong></p>
<p>The first handful of tiers are built around products that we’ll be actually selling for The Feely Human Collective. I’ve worked with an amazing designer, Emily Poulin, to design the t-shirts, stickers, and enamel pins—all of which are included in various tiers.</p>
<p>Here are the oh so adorable pins!</p>

<p>Because the ethos of The Feely Human Collective is <strong>community</strong>, I thought it would be fun to also have an add-on tier that features some swag from some of my favorite organizations and people like Just Peachy Comics, Liz and Mollie, Amanda Stern, and others!</p>
<p>For the higher-priced tiers, I wanted to give <strong>one-on-one</strong> personal attention to all those feely humans who contribute at these levels (and I truly hope it’s many, not for the financial boost, but for the lovely friendships that will be forged!). These tiers will include being a featured guest on You, Me, Empathy, Skype chats, me flying out to spend the day with you, and more!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>THE IMPACT:</h3>
<p>I want to make the world a more feely place—a more empathetic place! A more emotionally intelligent place! A more vulnerable place! I want to make a bigger impact in reducing the stigma of talking about our feelings. I want empathy to be an active topic in businesses and schools. But to achieve that, I’m asking for a little financial assistance to hit the ground running with wind in my sails. Wait, that’s a mixed metaphor. How about hitting the ground running with a rocket booster strapped to my back? Yes, that. :D</p>
<p>I'm hoping that by reaching my goal of $20,000, this will give me wiggle room to start making real strides in building the foundation of this brand new collective. It will also help me recoup the investment I've made up front.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES:</h3>
<p>Look, I’ve never done this before. I’ve never started a business (outside of freelance writing and editing), and I’ve never crowdfunded. The challenge is a big one: <i><strong>will people connect with this idea around empathy, vulnerability, and emotional wayfinding as core tenets of the human experience?</strong></i> Will this work as a platform? Will people pay to join our online workshops? Will this scale the way I think it will? Will this truly make the world a more feely place?</p>
<p>In the work and research I've done leading up to this point, I feel confident enough to say <strong>""YES!""</strong> to all of the above questions. But there's always a chance that it <i>may not work</i> as I am envisioning it now, and I will need to prepare for that potential outcome, pivot if I need to, and hold steadfast to my <i>why</i> (aka the reason why I am doing this): </p>
<p>The world needs more empathy. We need to see that vulnerability is a strength, not a weakness. We need to learn that our emotions are wondrous guideposts along the way. And we need safe spaces where humans can connect. That's what The Feely Human Collective aims to be. <strong>That's my why.</strong></p>
<p><i>If I don’t reach my goal of $20,000, there will be some strategic decisions that will have to be made. Potential impacts include fewer initial products designed and available for sale in the FHC shop (I have two new shirt designs ready to be printed), potentially a bi-weekly Feely Human Friday episode of the podcast instead of a weekly episode, a delayed timeline to reach Phase 3 of The Feely Human Collective, longer fulfillment cycles for shipping and returns, etc.</i></p>

Hi! My name is Nōn Wels. I’m a podcaster, doggo lover, and I’m here because I almost died from shutting off my heart to the world. I don’t want that for you. I’m hoping you found this crowdfunding campaign because you were led by your heart.

<p>We painted the mural in 1976,  the Bicentennial of the American Revolution, thinking Berkeley should have a memorial to its own revolutionary tradition. It has survived,  free of graffiti (mostly) for 42 years because of the protection of the community. But time has taken its toll.  Colors are fading and it badly needs repainting and sealing. If we act, now we can preserve it for another 42 years or more. If not we fear it will soon be lost forever.</p>
<p>We feel a particular urgency to save the mural, given that the University has announced plans to build on People’s Park. Now, more than ever, it is important to preserve a memorial to the struggles that led up to its creation. It's still the only one in Berkeley.</p>

In just five summers our little cafe-house by the beach has morphed into a specific and very fun culture, creating a new state within the minds of our friends and fans. We’ve organised over 160 musical, visual, sports events, activities for children, volunteering, environmentally-friendly happenings, fashion, film and photography occurrences. In the premisses of very unique nature and authentic architecture we’ve designed an alternative forest-scape for leisure and pleasure for variety of people. The mastery and charm of our community thrives on the fundamentals of DYI and the wildlife around - so all is for real, coming from the hearts of true dreamers and doers. Well known for a distinctive perception and alignment of atmosphere around us, we must admit we are quite an experiment and a daily surprise to ourselves too with every upcoming season. So there is a huge wave to catch in the summer of 2019 and it goes by the name of “Awake Creativity”. Listen up &amp; please contribute because this season without you is pretty beaches and dunes only.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Sound Shack</strong></p><p>Sound Shack is a yet to be mobile studio in the forests of Curorian Spit with professional sound equipment for rehearsals, jams and records. It’s a residency to express musical creativity, a place for new compositions, surprising collabs and new albums to happen. Our aim is to bring up a creatively oriented community. The reason Zuikio Daržas is such a phenomenal existence is because of all the musicians constantly fleeing to our place for creational and recreational reasons. A truly inspiring and welcoming place so we think such musical residency is a must if we are moving forward with new activities and creative processes. A success formula: during the summer season musicians from Lithuania and talents from all over the world come to the shack and get creative there. As a “thank you” gift they present a musical act for locals and tourists at the end of their session. The Sound Shack is a new leap for Zuikio Daržas, a contribution to the future of Lithuanian music scene and a key investment to Nida’s cultural climate. </p><p><strong>Day care camp “Rabbit’s Summer”</strong></p><p>A new playground and activities in the nature for the little ones. We know your dream holiday includes more tan and chill so here is an opportunity to take your kids to our day care camp and be sure they get to socialise with other sea kids and get creative as well.

Tuesday to Saturday, morning and evening sessions with best of Boxing, Muay Thai, MMA, Fitness, Movement and Yoga trainers from Lithuania. </p><p><strong>Movie nights</strong></p><p>Screenings of best picks from “Kino Pavasaris” programme and our own favourites.</p><p><strong>Impro workshops</strong></p><p>Want to live without any prejudice and spontaneously?

Žaisti, klysti ir džiaugtis!Šokių, edukacijos stovyklos jaunimui bei suaugusiemsVasarą Nidoje atostogaus Lietuvos šokių mokykla ‘Low Air’, atstovaujanti savitoms judesio subkultūroms.

Kiti eksperimentiniai patirtiniai spektakliai, kūno judesio terapija, taikomasis teatras, šokis, kino, muzikos, kitų menų seminarai. Geri darbai gamtaiPusiasalio mylėtojai žino, koks žavingas Kuršių Nerijos pajūrio ruožo kraštovaizdis, o ypač smėlio kopos, kurios nėra itin atsparios aplinkos įtakai. Norint jas išsaugoti, būtina žmonių pagalba. Kartu su ‘Kuršių Nerijos nacionalinio parko direkcija’ kviečiame visus savanoriškai prisidėti prie gamtotvarkos plano vykdymo, šalinant sumedėjusią augmeniją Naglių gamtiniame rezervate.

Įkvėpimo semiamasi iš kelionių aplink pasaulį ir į Nidą atvykstančių geriausių virtuvės šefų bei įdomiausių Lietuvos restoranų atstovų.

In just five summers our little cafe-house by the beach has morphed into a specific and very fun culture, creating a new state within the minds of our friends and fans. We’ve organised over 160 musical, visual, sports events, activities for children, volunteering, environmentally-friendly happenings, fashion, film and photography occurrences. In the premisses of very unique nature and authentic architecture we’ve designed an alternative forest-scape for leisure and pleasure for variety of people. The mastery and charm of our community thrives on the fundamentals of DYI and the wildlife around - so all is for real, coming from the hearts of true dreamers and doers. Well known for a distinctive perception and alignment of atmosphere around us, we must admit we are quite an experiment and a daily surprise to ourselves too with every upcoming season. So there is a huge wave to catch in the summer of 2019 and it goes by the name of “Awake Creativity”. Listen up & please contribute because this season without you is pretty beaches and dunes only. Sound ShackSound Shack is a yet to be mobile studio in the forests of Curorian Spit with professional sound equipment for rehearsals, jams and records. It’s a residency to express musical creativity, a place for new compositions, surprising collabs and new albums to happen. Our aim is to bring up a creatively oriented community. The reason Zuikio Daržas is such a phenomenal existence is because of all the musicians constantly fleeing to our place for creational and recreational reasons. A truly inspiring and welcoming place so we think such musical residency is a must if we are moving forward with new activities and creative processes. A success formula: during the summer season musicians from Lithuania and talents from all over the world come to the shack and get creative there. As a “thank you” gift they present a musical act for locals and tourists at the end of their session. The Sound Shack is a new leap for Zuikio Daržas, a contribution to the future of Lithuanian music scene and a key investment to Nida’s cultural climate. Day care camp “Rabbit’s Summer”A new playground and activities in the nature for the little ones. We know your dream holiday includes more tan and chill so here is an opportunity to take your kids to our day care camp and be sure they get to socialise with other sea kids and get creative as well. Fun news - excuse to have fun on the weekend evenings as well. Age 4-10 years old. Get to know other parents and join the community.Sport in the ResortLast season was a power blast! So here we move again. Tuesday to Saturday, morning and evening sessions with best of Boxing, Muay Thai, MMA, Fitness, Movement and Yoga trainers from Lithuania. Movie nightsScreenings of best picks from “Kino Pavasaris” programme and our own favourites.Impro workshopsWant to live without any prejudice and spontaneously? Join our impro classes, while it’s not for actors only but as well a great opportunity for anyone to learn how to enjoy failing and starting all over again with a smile on your face. A window to opening your creative flow and enjoying a beauty of a given moment.Educational classes for youth and adultsDance team “Low Air” - camp of movement’s culture.Film-making workshop with Marat Sargsyan.Music for all - musical education workshop with Remigijus Rančys.Theatrical workshop for children and teens.Environmentally friendly causesCurorian Spit’s nature scapes are very unique however fragile. So we are always involved into aspects of preserving and taking care of it. Maximum reduction of plastic waste is our priority this season.Open KitchenChefs from famous restaurants and other gastronomical enthusiasts are invited to experiment in our open kitchen. Wild life and wild food experiments. So what’s in it for YOU?Your contribution is vital for all the above to become the awesome reality of 2019.

<h3>ROOM PROJECT IS A SPACE FOR WOMEN + NON-BINARY WRITERS + ARTISTS </h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.roomproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Room Project</a> felt there was a need for intersectional creative community in Detroit and responded with a call for women and non-binary writers and artists to move their artistic practices into a (semi) public sphere. The project has since evolved into a dynamic setting for programming, workshops, public conversations, and a rotating installation space for Detroit's fine artists to perform and show their work in the storefront windows. We have made affordable access for women of color and queer communities a top priority and provided a quiet workplace where safety, focus and drive can flourish. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>WE HAVE NEEDS, DESIRES, WANTS...</strong></h3>
<p>Well, we have to pay rent. And we're close to covering our monthly overhead. But once we have enough members/membership fees to cover that, we still need to provide honorariums for the artists who bring their talent to Room Project. We believe deeply that artists, specifically women/NB/GNC artists, are too often asked to do favors, donate, give away time, or undervalue themselves. Everybody's got to get paid if artists are going to survive, and stay.</p>
<p>Beyond that, <strong>we still need practical things</strong>: more shelving, books, a bulletin board, a projector, pens, a loaner laptop, coffee mugs, planters, a website with an archive, a book binder. We want to <i>always</i> say yes to the writers &amp; artists of Detroit who come to us with a great project, and have a little money to get the word out about that great project. <strong>We want to say to the young, brilliant, energized, and often broke members &amp; friends of Room Project: ""Cool. Now how can you make that idea bigger?"" </strong>We want to be able to fly in a few writers that make our members swoon. We want great coffee. We want to sponsor writers who can't afford membership. </p>
<h3><i>Members</i></h3>
<p>First, <strong>we want you to be a member here</strong>. You write poems, but you don't show them to anyone. You publish, but you don't know where to find readings in Detroit. You dropped out of your program, and you miss the conversations you had when you were surrounded by people who loved the thing you loved. You can't write in the house when there's laundry to do. Use Room Project to do your work/meet your people/make a thing in the world that should exist. Use Room Project to play, and be just a bit bolder in the world.</p>
<p>$50 a month gives you 24-hour access to the space, 50% discounts on workshops and events, too much coffee, and a once-a-month meeting with other members to talk about what you're working on these days. There's no contract, it's monthly. If you can't afford $50, you can pay less and volunteer. </p>
<h3><i>Non-Members</i></h3>
<p>If membership isn't right for you, or you're a cis male, you still can still participate in our public programming, workshops and help supplement other people's discounted memberships. You can help make a very cool project come to life in Detroit and <strong>help our community feel energized, supported, seen</strong>. Donate a membership to someone who can't afford it, but still manages to write between the two jobs they hold down; donate a sum in the name of a woman in your life who never had the opportunity to take her talent seriously; send this campaign to a person who needs to hear that their voice fucking <i>matters</i>.  </p>
</div><div>
<h2>PERKS! </h2>
<p>Let there be perks.</p>
<p>–If you choose a MEMBERSHIP, or SUPPORT @ $50, you will receive a sexy tote bag where in the future someone you're a tiny bit attracted to will ask you, ""Hey, where'd you get that sexy tote bag?"" and then you'll tell them, and then maybe you'll fall in love. It could happen. </p>
<p>–If you choose a MEMBERSHIP, you will also have a seat at our first members-only dinner. This dinner is a collaboration with social practice artist Zoe Minikes of<a href=""http://zoeminikes.com/victory-kitchen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Victory Kitchen</a>, and will take place in a beautiful private venue and be the best night of your life. </p>

Even though we cannot see clearly how it's going to turn out, we are still called to let the future into our imagination… The web of life both cradles us and calls us to weave it further.“ ~Joanna Macy Western culture is coming apart at the seams. Disconnection & commodification runs rampant. The old story of hyper-individualism is pulling us toward nearly-inevitable internal & external collapse. This deep transformation, though painful, is only the pain of labor, as we collectively birth what comes next…           How Are We Helping To Fix It?This tour is a direct cultural response to those aspects of our society breeding fear and separation. We stand for the creative integration of our pain and our desires for the world, through creating social containers that practice some of the healthiest Organizing Principles of Life:  Connection, Creativity, Diversity, Locality, Learning, Synergy, (and many others). When we stand together, creatively united under these principles, we inherently strengthen relationships and inner tools for navigating our present realities together. See www.backtolife.org to learn about who we are, and what we stand for! Revival Tour Specifics:                                                                               Our tour will be composed of 10 stops along the coastal cities of the Salish Sea. From small intentional communities, to large venues in urban areas, we've been graciously invited into people's homes to offer workshops, facilitate dialogue, break bread, and share world changing music with people of all ages, races, and orientations. Lydia Violet's ""Music As Medicine In Our Time"" workshops are an offering of Joanna Macy's ""Work That Reconnects"" combined with exploring music as a way our communities practice resiliency, truth-speaking, and sourcing our energy for action in our time.We've partnered with many local organizations in towns along the way, who will help bring deep community participation and dialogue about what really matters! These organizations include: NewStories, The Orcasong Alliance, The Permaculture Action Network, The Salish Sea Marine Sanctuary, The OrcaNetwork, The Compassion Games, The Thriving Communities Conference, and many others... (Please look into these beautiful efforts!)Book-ended by 2 full day gatherings, and peppered with 8 evening events in between, we've got a robust plate of opportunity ahead of us! Permaculture projects, ""Work That Reconnects"" workshops, Community asset mapping, Participatory murals, Poetry workshops, & Silkscreening projects, oh my! We can't wait to hit the road and bring what's in our hearts out into the world...  Imagine a World:          Imagine a world inspired by radical social change makers like ourselves (and YOURself!) roaming the countryside every summer in ""Chautauqua-like"" fashion, going to communities large and small over the years, building relationship, reviving True celebration, and bringing together people around social & environmental causes that can only be addressed at the hyper-local level.Imagine a world of joy, connection, and action catalyzed by bards and poets and facilitators, who help to bring out the very best nature of those around them through tried & true social practices... Where children dance, where adults consult with each other, where teens express themselves, and where elders are honored for their wisdom sharing... THIS is our dream for each community we touch down in, and we can't wait to co-create it with YOU!!!  Our Credentials:          The Revival Team is composed of many highly-accomplished people, each an artist and activist in their own right. Though we’ve come together under the same banner for this tour, as individuals we are:  trained facilitators, professional touring musicians, large-scale event coordinators, professional photographer/videographers, professional muralists, participatory governance specialists, trained activists, counselors, and so much more... You are in good hands with us, and we look forward to sharing what we have to offer with YOU!!!Check out Lydia Violet's music and work with Joanna Macy at www.lydiafiddle.com !!Our Mentors:Revival has a wide cadre of mentors helping to inform our efforts. The following thought leaders are seasoned contributors in their fields, and have graciously offered their wisdom in service of our mission:
Joanna Macy  (eco-philosopher, author, buddhist scholar, WTR creator)
Tom Atlee   (collective intelligence scholar, author, facilitator)
Michelle Holliday  (international consultant, author, living systems scholar)
Michael Dowd  (eco-evangelist, best-selling author, revivalist ; )                                                                    
Teresa Posakony  (process/hosting expert, living systems scholar)

<h3>What Is The Infinite Love Party?</h3>
<p>When the Bushwick Starr programmed Diana, and asked her what she wanted to create, the Infinite Love Party was born.</p>
<p>A gift of Diana’s is her ability to create community around her. If you saw her NYTimes Critics’ Pick show last year, {mylingerieplay}, you’ve already experienced the radical, glittery, queer joy that is Diana’s gift and the glue with which she builds community.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to give the transformative experience that only the best parties can give. Think of it as the wedding of your dreams - but this wedding is based on self-love and intentionally making space for QTPOC and their allies. Our dream is to create an intentional glittery space for queer utopia, to crack open the hearts of the people who walk into our space, and to bring more love into the world through pleasure, desire, and play.</p>
<p>The Infinite Love Party is an intentional barefoot potluck dinner, dance party, and sleepover. There will be music, performances, dancing, and healing. The Infinite Love Party is where love is forged. A celebration of soul awakening. It's where play breeds change. It's where queer magic can do its healing. For All People. A celebration of the outskirts. A celebration of Queerness and our Allies. A celebration of POC and our Allies. A space for bare humanity to exist- where we will leave kinder and more open, more connected to our purpose, our bodies, and our hearts. A celebration of liberated selves. A celebration of liberated love. AN INFINITE LOVE PARTY!</p>
<h3>What Can Guests Expect at the Parties?</h3>
<p>Dance Party featuring DJ Nessuno!</p>
<p>Aphrodisiac Tea!</p>
<p>Barefoot Finger Painting!</p>
<p>A limited number of sleepover tickets will be available each night-- Sleepover! Hell yeah!</p>
<p>The evening includes a DOPE MOTHERF*CKER award given each night to a different person/organization who has made amazing contributions in the realms of sex, queerness, and collective liberation, including:</p>
<p><strong>The Moon Choir (a community choir for queer/trans folks and allies) for singing into our Collective Liberation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dawn Orlando and Funkadelic Studios for their constant support of so many independent New York based musicians</strong></p>
<p><strong>Francisco Ramirez for his relentless pursuit in providing accessible sex advice and education to the world</strong></p>
<p><strong>The First National KQTCON Organizing Committee (Korean Queer and Trans Conference)</strong></p>
<p><strong>API Rainbow Parents of PFLAG NYC for envisioning a world where diversity is celebrated and all people are respected, valued, and affirmed inclusive of their sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sandy Hong and New Women's Space </strong></p>
<p><strong>Russell G. Jones and The Blind Spot</strong></p>
<p><strong>Poppy Liu and Collective Sex  </strong></p>

<p>Space Designer: Carolyn Mraz </p>
<p>Lighting Designer: Kate McGee</p>
<p>Producers: Wednesday Derrico of Experimental Bitch Presents and Annie Middleton</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;"">We have worked hard to make this project as low-budget as possible. The Bushwick Starr has provided us with a great opportunity to share this experience with you all, but our team does not receive any of the box office income, so in order to make this dream possible, we need to raise  an additional $10,000. </span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;"">The funds that YOU can help us raise will go towards the following:</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;"">- Paying all of the artists who are working on this project. This includes our team of Super Queer Heart Questers (our Core Party Team), our designers, and producing team. </span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;"">- The design elements that we aren't able to make ourselves. Our plan is to go as DIY with this party as possible, but we will incur some additional expenses, including insurance and design materials that will make the experience even more magical!</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;"">- This is NOT your typical theatrical experience - it's a party! Which means it requires additional staffing and support to keep the needs and safety of the attendees a top priority. Your donations will go towards supporting the additional staff. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;"">- Donations will go to The Bushwick Starr and will be used solely to fund The Infinite Love Party. </span></p>

Producers: Wednesday Derrico of Experimental Bitch Presents and Annie Middleton

What Do We Need?
We have worked hard to make this project as low-budget as possible. The Bushwick Starr has provided us with a great opportunity to share this experience with you all, but our team does not receive any of the box office income, so in order to make this dream possible, we need to raise  an additional $10,000. 
The funds that YOU can help us raise will go towards the following:
- Paying all of the artists who are working on this project. This includes our team of Super Queer Heart Questers (our Core Party Team), our designers, and producing team. 
- The design elements that we aren't able to make ourselves. Our plan is to go as DIY with this party as possible, but we will incur some additional expenses, including insurance and design materials that will make the experience even more magical!
- This is NOT your typical theatrical experience - it's a party! Which means it requires additional staffing and support to keep the needs and safety of the attendees a top priority. Your donations will go towards supporting the additional staff. 
- Donations will go to The Bushwick Starr and will be used solely to fund The Infinite Love Party. 
- Donations are tax-deductible!

Thank you! We appreciate the support and would love to have you at one of our parties!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Now a student of the Shang Shung School of Tibetan Medicine, he was asked by Dr. Wangmo to head the textbook project and see it through to its completion.</p><p>Words from Aric:</p><p>""Hi, I’m Aric, with the Shang Shung Insitute School of Tibetan Medicine. This school, started by the Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche and Dr. Phuntsog Wangmo has been a beacon of Tibetan Medicine in the west. Already, there have been so many great practitioners of Tibetan Medicine that have come out of Dr. Wangmo and the Shang Shung Institute Schools’ guidance and training. It is no easy task to represent the subject material and teachings in a way that is exactly true to form, and lineage. However, Dr. Wangmo has been firm in maintaining the connection to the traditional teachings, and not deviating from the course of study that is being taught in Tibetan medical universities.</p><p>Right now the school is in need. There is a lot to be done to continue to growing as an Academic Institution in the west. Due to Dr. Wangmo’s dedication to tradition, so far, myself and the other students of the program have been using textbooks which are solely in Tibetan.

Now a student of the Shang Shung School of Tibetan Medicine, he was asked by Dr. Wangmo to head the textbook project and see it through to its completion.Words from Aric:""Hi, I’m Aric, with the Shang Shung Insitute School of Tibetan Medicine. This school, started by the Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche and Dr. Phuntsog Wangmo has been a beacon of Tibetan Medicine in the west. Already, there have been so many great practitioners of Tibetan Medicine that have come out of Dr. Wangmo and the Shang Shung Institute Schools’ guidance and training. It is no easy task to represent the subject material and teachings in a way that is exactly true to form, and lineage. However, Dr. Wangmo has been firm in maintaining the connection to the traditional teachings, and not deviating from the course of study that is being taught in Tibetan medical universities.Right now the school is in need. There is a lot to be done to continue to growing as an Academic Institution in the west. Due to Dr. Wangmo’s dedication to tradition, so far, myself and the other students of the program have been using textbooks which are solely in Tibetan. In this program students are mostly required to start to learn basic Tibetan so that they can understand the concepts being presented in the rgyud bzhi. For someone like me, who has been studying Tibetan language for the past seven years, that may be a somewhat easier task.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We are a group of scholars expelled from our posts in the aftermath of the failed coup of July 2016, but the history of our dismissal goes beyond the pretext of the Coup. As the petitioners of a call for justice and peace criticising the security policies of the government in the South East of the country, we had already been subjected to harsh reactions and sanctions of power holders, particularly of President Erdogan. A dozen of our colleagues in the city had already lost their academic posts well before the coup.</p>
<p>Most of these colleagues had to move abroad as they had no chance of finding new posts as we have been stigmatised  as ""petitioners"". Other chose to stay and with the state of emergency had no chance to move as we are all expelled from public function and lost our passports.</p>
<p><strong>Why an ""House of Culture""?</strong></p>
<p>The idea of this ""house of culture"" was born in this extraordinary context with the primary objective of sustaining our contact with books, science, students, colleagues and the public in general.</p>
<h2><strong>What Do We Need?</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>We managed to accomplish the main infrastructure of the House thanks to the generous support of our families and friends. Now we have a rich library and a comfortable cafe (<a href=""https://youtu.be/S6ZzMeBQbKo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/bTmy5KmvqZs</a>).</p>
<p>But in order to go beyond being a cafe, we need further support.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Enriching the library</strong>: the library consists of our own books mainly on social sciences and in Turkish. But we want to render it to a modern library offering books on all domains of science and literature. Especially, we need significant funding for publications in foreign languages. One of our dreams is to have <strong>a section in Arabic</strong> that will address to our Syrian neighbours (almost 20% of the city population) who took refuge in Mersin since the beginning of the civil war in Syria.</li>
<li>
<strong>Access to electronic sources</strong>: Online scientific resources have become the main source of academic publications and discussions. Mainly functioning on institutional subscriptions, individual access to such resources cost very expensive for those who are deprived from such institutional affiliations. We would like to offer these rich resources to our students and friends to contribute to their ongoing researches or studies.</li>
<li>
<strong>Publication of a menu-newsletter: </strong>We want our menu to be a fanzine that can be kept by our visitors. Apart from information on what we serve, we want it to include short texts and news on literature, science, city and ecology. The periodical publication of such menu-fanzine requires funding.</li>
<li>
<strong>Guests</strong>: As we want to render the House to a public sphere constantly hosting events, we want to invite authors, artists, scholars from different parts of the country and if possible of the World. But for further funding is essential to finance their flights and accommodation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Outcome</h2>
</div><div>
<p>If we manage to reach to these goals, we will prove to all those who expelled us from public posts that we do not need their titles and functions to be able to do our job and to keep our relationship with the public.</p>

<h3>Helfen Sie uns, unser Haus der Kultur und Hoffnung zu bauen</h3>
<p>Geben Sie eine Hand an die Gründung eines bescheidenen Kulturzentrums mit einer Bibliothek und einem Café in Mersin / Türkei</p>
<h3>Der Überblick</h3>
<p>Die Idee ist einfach und konkret: die Gründung einer Haus der Kultur in der sich Freunde unterhalten, Aktivisten treffen, Künstler kreieren, Intellektuelle diskutieren und Studenten lernen. Zu diesem Zweck haben wir zunächst eine Bibliothek, in der wir alle unsere Bücher gesammelt haben. Auf der anderen Seite gibt es ein Café mit einer Terrasse, wo wir hoffen  Freunde zu treffen und thematische Veranstaltungen über Literatur, Kino, lokale und internationale Agenda, Ökologie und die Mersin Stadtkultur zu organisieren. Ausserdem haben wir eine Mezzanine für kleine Gruppenbesprechungen von Verbänden und NGO (regierungsunabhängige Organisationen) etc. Wer sind wir? Wir sind eine Gruppe von Gelehrten, die nach dem gescheiterten Coup (Putsch) vom Juli 2016 aus ihren Posten vertrieben wurden, aber die Geschichte unserer Entlassung geht weit über den Vorwand des Coups hinaus. Als die Petenten einer Forderung nach Gerechtigkeit und Frieden, die die Sicherheitspolitik der Regierung im Südosten des Landes kritisierten (Academics for Peace// Akademiker für den Frieden) waren wir bereits harten Reaktionen und Sanktionen von Machtinhabern, insbesondere von Präsident Erdogan, unterworfen worden. Ein Dutzend unserer Kollegen in der Stadt hatten bereits vor dem Putsch ihre akademischen Posten verloren. Die meisten dieser Kollegen mussten ins Ausland ziehen, da sie keine Chance hatten neue Posten zu finden, da wir als ""die Petenten"" stigmatisiert wurden. Andere wählten zu bleiben und hatten dann aber mit dem Ausnahmezustand keine Chance mehr sich zu bewegen da wir alle aus unserer öffentlichen Funktion vertrieben wurden verloren wir auch unsere Pässe. Warum ein ""Haus der Kultur""? Die Idee dieses ""Hauses der Kultur"" entstand in diesem außergewöhnlichen Kontext mit dem primären Ziel, unseren Kontakt zu Büchern, Wissenschaft, Studenten, Kollegen und der Öffentlichkeit im Allgemeinen zu erhalten. Was wir brauchen</p>
<p>Wir haben es geschafft, die Hauptinfrastruktur des Hauses dank der großzügigen Unterstützung unserer Familien und Freunde zu erreichen. Jetzt haben wir eine reichhaltige Bibliothek und ein gemütliches Cafe (<a href=""https://youtu.be/bTmy5KmvqZs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/bTmy5KmvqZs</a>). Aber um mehr als über ein Cafe zu kommen, brauchen wir weitere Unterstützung.</p>
<h3>Bereicherung der Bibliothek:</h3>
<p>Die Bibliothek besteht aus unseren eigenen Büchern hauptsächlich über Sozialwissenschaften und auf Türkisch. Aber wir wollen es zu einer modernen, die Bücher über alle Bereiche der Wissenschaft und Literatur anbietet umsetzen. Besonders benötigen wir eine bedeutende Beihilfe für Publikationen in Fremdsprachen. Einer unserer Träume ist, einen Abschnitt auf Arabisch zu erschaffen, der sich an unsere syrischen Nachbarn (fast 20% der Stadtbevölkerung) richten wird, die seit Beginn des Bürgerkriegs in Syrien nach  Mersin geflochten sind.</p>
<h3>Zugang zu elektronischen Quellen:</h3>
<p>Online-wissenschaftliche Ressourcen sind die Hauptquelle für akademische Publikationen und Diskussionen. Diese Quellen sind hauptsächlich auf institutionellen Abonnements funktioniert, Der individuelle Zugang zu solchen Ressourcen ist für diejenigen, die von solchen institutionellen Zugehörigkeiten ausgeschlossen sind, sehr teuer. Wir möchten diese reichen Ressourcen unseren Studenten und Freunden anbieten, um zu ihren laufenden Forschungen oder Studien beizutragen.</p>
<h3>Publikation eines Menu – Mitteilungsblattes:</h3>
<p>Wir wollen, dass unsere Speisekarte eine Fanzine ist, die von unseren Besuchern aufbewahrt werden kann. Abgesehen von Informationen über das, was wir servieren, wollen wir auch dass die Fanzine kurze Texte und Neuigkeiten über Literatur, Wissenschaft, Stadt und Ökologie beinhaltet. Jedoch fordert die periodische Veröffentlichung dieser Menü-Fanzine eine Finanzierung.</p>
<h3>Gäste:</h3>
<p>Da wir das Haus zu einer öffentlichen Sphäre erschaffen wollen, in der ständig Veranstaltungen veranstaltet werden, wollen wir Autoren, Künstler und Gelehrte aus verschiedenen Teilen des Landes und möglichst der Welt einladen. Aber für weitere Planungen ist es wichtig, die Flüge und Unterkünfte zu finanzieren.</p>
<h3>Das Ergebnis</h3>
<p>Wenn wir es schaffen, auf diese Ziele zu gelangen, werden wir allen, die uns aus unseren öffentlichen Stellen vertrieben haben beweisen, dass wir ihre Titel und Funktionen nicht brauchen um unsere Studien/ Recherchen zu machen und unsere Beziehung mit der Öffentlichkeit zu halten.</p>

The introduction provides the reasons why I am writing the book and what I hope my book to achieve. In chapter 1, I bring my audience with me to my journeys in the UK and Colombia. I share my experience on living with host families from different cultures and how those positive experiences impacted my understanding of inter-cultural and inter-racial relationship.

<p>Hi Everyone! My name is Davina Pacley and I am a lifestyle influencer  &amp; the Founder/CEO of DivinelyCROWN'D. DivinelyCROWN'D is a brand that I created in 2018 to encourage women to have self-love and confidence through faith, lifestyle and fashion.  Since I was a little girl I have always had a passion to be a positive light and influence to people and I feel with this brand I have done that so far. I truly believe that all women are Queens and that her life is her Queendom.</p>
<p>Growing a brand has been exciting and yet very challenging so far. It takes a lot of time, research,  and most definitely money to grow the brand of your dreams. Which is why I decided to create this crowdfunding campaign in hopes of gaining some financial support from my peers.</p>
<p>If you decided to support and donate to this crowdfunding campaign you are doing more than just giving financial support, but you are also saying you believe in the mission and vision of DivinelyCROWN'D.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The goal for this campaign is $6000. The funds raised will be used towards brand development, such as brand merchandise, technological equipment, promotional material, and more.</p>
<p>If the entire goal isn't met with in 30 days funds raised will still be used towards brand development.</p>
<p>I truly believe in DivinelyCROWN'D so much and I know with your support I can continue to reach women, not just in our community, but all over the world in a positive way. </p>

<p>Making Mead each year has become one or our favorite rituals. The idea was given in a dream, community brewing prosperity, abundance, and vitality together in honor of Queen Medb. The main ingredient, golden honey, isn’t cheap especially when buying it in tens of pounds. We like to source the honey for this event from local polytheist/pagan beekeepers and we like to compensate them fairly, so this bump helps keep the prosperity going for another glorious year!</p> <p><strong>Stretch Goal 2- $2500 - Cauldron of Plenty!</strong></p>
<p>Our traveling feasting hall is hoping to hit the road again this year bringing feasting flavor to other fabulous events, like <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/558347781304596/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Hosting at the Morrigan’s Hearth</a>.

Fairest of Them All (4 available): Sometimes we struggle with finding the beauty in ourselves. This candle helps you to see the beauty that is you and reflect that beauty out into the world. It is rooted in the belief that we are ALL the Fairest and that beauty need not be a competitive struggle within or without.

Budget
Goal: $1500 - Hospitality Hall
$1500 Covers our base costs for bringing the traveling feasting hall to PantheaCon once again. We love sharing our warm, welcoming hospitality hall; offering tasty nutritious snacks, devotional events, and lounge space to chat about our Gods, craft, devotional practice, or the latest archaeological findings. We believe in the power of feasting can change the world, and you can join us on this delicious mission. Stretch Goal 1- $1750 - Golden Abundance!
Making Mead each year has become one or our favorite rituals. The idea was given in a dream, community brewing prosperity, abundance, and vitality together in honor of Queen Medb. The main ingredient, golden honey, isn’t cheap especially when buying it in tens of pounds. We like to source the honey for this event from local polytheist/pagan beekeepers and we like to compensate them fairly, so this bump helps keep the prosperity going for another glorious year! Stretch Goal 2- $2500 - Cauldron of Plenty!
Our traveling feasting hall is hoping to hit the road again this year bringing feasting flavor to other fabulous events, like A Hosting at the Morrigan’s Hearth. We are mighty little group and do not take profit from our events. This seed fund will help us lighten the costs that individuals bear for travel, and add to the experiences we can offer. If there is an event near you you think would be a good fit please let us know!",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>AIM:</strong> To start a campaign about the costs for artists of performing at the Edinburgh Festival. </p>
<p>I am a fringe theatre director and producer. Having taken shows to Edinburgh in 2015 and 2017, and speaking to other artists who have, I have been shocked the <strong>year-on-year increases</strong> in venue and accommodation costs, which are already at unmanageable levels for artists on low incomes.</p>
<p><strong>I share this concern with countless artists who love to perform at the Festival but struggle to afford it</strong>. We share this problem, but without clear data to prove this how can we protest about rising costs?</p>
<p>I am working on a survey to send out to artists who have performed at the Edinburgh Festival, to collect data anonymously on yearly venue and accommodation costs. This information will form the basis of a campaign and publication to <strong>highlight this issue to our industry and audiences</strong>.</p>
<p>By presenting this information in a <strong>clear and compelling</strong> way, we can gain public support for a campaign to reduce costs, and <strong>hold providers to account for rising prices</strong>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To create a survey of suitable complexity requires advanced paid features in SurveyMonkey. A subscription is <strong>£35 per month</strong>, and the survey will run for <strong>6 months</strong> - 3 to collect data, 3 to analyse the results - coming to <strong>£210 total.</strong></p>
<p>You can support this campaign to make the Edinburgh Fringe fair by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Donating what you can</strong> - I have put in the first £10, and if <strong>20 people put in £10</strong> each we'll reach the target in no time.</li>
<li>Anything raised above the £210 will go towards making this campaign as professional as possible - for example, supporting the quality of the publication or extending the SurveyMonkey subscription to allow for more advanced analysis.</li>
<li>I am passionate about making this project happen; but<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> cannot afford the monthly subscription on my own. Please donate what you can to make this project a reality.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: The minimum target on IndieGoGo is £500 - </strong><strong>however</strong><strong> this is a keep-what-you-raise project, which means that any money raised will still go towards this campaign if it meets that target or not. My current aim is to raise £250 to cover the cost of a </strong><strong>6 month</strong><strong> subscription to SurveyMonkey (see below) and crowdfunding fees (5% of total + 3% + £0.30 credit card fees + £25 transfer charge). Once complete, this campaign will stay live as an 'InDemand' page, allowing me to fundraise for future costs of this project if necessary. </strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We can push for a more fair Fringe deal for artists by working together, to campaign for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>More transparency in venue costs</strong> across the Fringe, and accountability for rising prices</li>
<li>
<strong>Fairer rates for artists</strong> performing at the festival, and greater leverage when negotiating contracts with venues</li>
<li>
<strong>Greater accountability of accommodation providers</strong> for rent prices during the Festival</li>
<li>
<strong>Higher awareness amongst audiences</strong> of the costs of performing at the Fringe</li>
</ul>
<p>This is important not just for individual artists, but for the sustainability of creative culture in the UK. The more accessible the Fringe is, the more diverse, risk-taking art we will see there.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge to an effective campaign on Edinburgh Festival costs are:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Lack of public awareness</strong> about this issue; for example, many audience members believe box office income covers the cost of performing at the Fringe. We need to show the real disparity between the costs and income.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lack of accountability </strong>of venue and accommodation providers; by launching this campaign we are asking them to explain <i>why<i> </i></i>costs are increasing, and what they can do to protect the performing artists that make the Festival what it is.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lack of negotiating power </strong>of artists; many artists feel it is too risky to complain, or negotiate with venues about the cost of their hire/guarantee, or for a better box office split. By collecting data from numerous artists anonymously, we can start to organise a collective response to this issue which demands to be addressed.</li>
</ul>
<p>What are the risks?</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>A backlash by venue and accommodation providers</strong>; by creating an anonymous survey, I can protect the artists who contribute data to this campaign from any backlash. But I am prepared to go public in running this campaign, because it's a cause I believe in.</li></ul>

<div>The biggest challenges in launching this campaign are:</div>

<h3>Welcome, and Io Saturnalia!</h3>
<p>This is our second annual Saturnalia event, and we intend to make it the best one yet! This year we are renting out the Marquis Theater in Denver, Colorado on the 29th of December. We have an exciting night planed, full of a variety of bands and entertainers sure to please anyone that may attend. We will also be holding our first Unbaptism Ritual. You are not going to want to miss this!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We need your help.</h3>
<p>We hate to ask for money, but this event requires just a bit up front. The venue rental itself is a bit pricey, but renting this amazing venue allows us to relax and enjoy the event instead of working it all night. Plus, the funds raised here will benefit you in other ways as well. Some will be used towards deposit on the performers, some goes to creation of event specific merchandise that will only be available at the show, and helps create new merch with our brand new logo on them. Plus (!), anyone that donates here will receive a ticket (at certain price points), and exclusive items that we are making available to backers of this campaign only. Each higher tier of purchase includes rewards from the lower tier! We've made this worth your while.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Thank YOU!</h3>
<p>We operate as a community, and we can't do any of this without your support. We are always very appreciative of all the support we receive, and we try to ask very little in return. We hope you'll consider supporting us monetarily, just this once, and if all goes well we'll not have to ask again. Hail Satan!</p>

<h2>The truth</h2>
<p>We all know Tories love a good soundbite, and you will hear ""highest taxed part of the UK"" coming out of Tory mouths about a million times over the next 12 months. But as always, the truth is  more complicated.</p>
<p>The Scottish Government has introduced two new tax bands as well as changing the rates <i>and</i> the thresholds at which taxes start to apply. The <strong>majority of people have actually been given a tax cut</strong>.

The truth
We all know Tories love a good soundbite, and you will hear ""highest taxed part of the UK"" coming out of Tory mouths about a million times over the next 12 months. But as always, the truth is  more complicated.
The Scottish Government has introduced two new tax bands as well as changing the rates and the thresholds at which taxes start to apply. The majority of people have actually been given a tax cut. You can read the full details here.
These are the actual rates. The old ones are on the left, and the new ones (which came into force on the 6th April 2018) on the right:

 
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has put this into graph form:

Notice that the difference between the new Scottish tax rates and the Rest of the UK ones is actually quite small. But to listen to the Tories you would think that the four horsemen of the apocalypse are about to ride through your house!
 
The IFS has also done an impact assessment based on the population's income:

75% of Scots now pay less or see no change under the new tax rules.
 
Only 25% are being asked to pay a little bit more.
How much more? The estimable Colin Dunn has produced a nice infographic for that:

 
And remember, this is just on income tax. When you factor in Council Tax, the picture changes dramatically:

The average Band D (which is most houses) council tax rate in England is 39% higher than in Scotland.

So ""highest taxed part of the UK"" is complete rubbish. The vast majority of Scots pay less and get more from the Scottish Government than people living in England.
Tories hate tax rises, especially ones targeting the rich. So they'll lie, and lie, and lie, and lie to get the public to believe that millionaires are downtrodden people who need to pay less tax than the poor because otherwise they might not be able to afford their skiing holidays.
 
So what do we do about it?
We want to produce 200,000 postcards featuring Colin's info-graphic showing that the Tories are talking complete mince on Scottish taxes. The reverse of the card will also feature the findings of a recent Ferret investigation which proves that the Tories are the biggest liars in the Scottish political firmament.

<h3>Bienvenida a esta campaña!</h3>
<p>Hola! Mi nombre es Nuria, una de las mujeres detrás de este jugoso proyecto!</p>
<p>Mi biografía me ha llevado hasta este momento, el aquí y ahora, al encontrarme compartiendo habilidades para co-crear un evento por y para mujeres. Siento el deseo de dar a la comunidad eso mismo que ella ofrece, desde esta particular posición de compartir una perspectiva personal y creativa junto con otras mujeres colaboradoras.</p>
<p>La propuesta es repetir un evento que se llevó a cabo el verano pasado en Madrid; las jornadas intensivas ""Mujer y Autoconocimiento"", un espacio donde nutrir la conciencia colectiva.</p>
<p>La forma se co-crea a través de una serie de actividades que se desarrollan a lo largo de 3 días, donde el Arte y la Salud son los pilares que sostienen las jornadas. Desde la Perfomance a la Medicina China, pasando por la música y la comida co-crearemos un espacio de investigación, escucha, intercambio y disfrute.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Para este segunda edición, tu colaboración ayuda a que proyectos como este, creado de forma auto-gestionada por la comunidad y para la comunidad, sigan siendo posibles. A su vez apoyas con tu generosidad a la transformación de muchas vidas, ya que este es el carácter de las jornadas. </span></p>
<p>Te invito a continuación a tomarte un momento para disfrutar del video que reune lo que fueron algunos de los preciados momentos de la primera edición de las jornadas:</p>

<h3>Un fin de semana diferente</h3>
<p>En Agosto de este verano 2019 nos volvemos a reunir para celebrar de nuevo este hermoso encuentro; comenzamos el viernes 2 por la tarde, tenemos un círculo de apertura donde una matrona de la Fundación  Entredós,  que acoge en su espacio el evento, nos da la bienvenida, se presentan también las colaboradoras y las actividades del fin de semana. A continuación disfrutamos de una maratón de <strong><u>performances</u></strong> donde 4 <strong><u>mujeres</u></strong> comparten su arte desde el <strong><u>cuerpo</u></strong> y el <strong><u>movimiento</u></strong>. Concluimos la tarde con un picoteo para nutrir los <strong><u>vínculos</u></strong>!</p>
<p>El sábado 3 empezamos el día con un taller de 4 horas enfocado a estudios energéticos abordados desde la <strong><u>Medicina Tradicional China</u></strong> a cargo de las <strong><u>Acupuntoras Descalzas</u></strong>, Escuela de Medicina Tradicional China. Después de esto disfrutamos de otro espacio de <strong><u>nutrición</u></strong> desde la <strong><u>alimentación consciente</u></strong> invitando a cada participante a compartir la comida que ha traído desde su casa hecha por ella para compartir con el resto. A continuación nos tomamos el té escuchando el testimonio de 1 mujer que se abre a la <strong><u>intimidad</u></strong> de <strong><u>inspirar</u></strong> con su biografía a otras. Finalmente cerramos la jornada con una jam de <strong><u>música</u></strong> guiada por una musicoterapeuta y una cantante, 2 mujeres que sostienen el espacio para <u><strong>nosotras</strong></u> y nuestra <strong><u>expresión</u> </strong>a través del sonido.</p>
<p>El domingo 4 arrancamos con otro taller de 4 horas de Medicina Tradicional China, promoviendo la <strong><u>autogestión</u>, <u>cuidados</u> y <u>auto-responsabilidad</u></strong> de una misma. Volvemos a disfrutar después del espacio de la comida y concluimos las jornadas con un conversatorio y presentación del proyecto Acupuntoras Descalzas, Escuela de Medicina Tradicional China que se encargan este año de involucrarse significativamente en las jornadas, compartiendo con nosotras a su vez el proyecto de su ONG que participa en la promoción de la salud en regiones submedicalizadas, respetando las medicinas tradicionales y privilegiando la aproximación cultural entre los pueblos indígenas. En esta ocasión, contaremos con la presencia de acupuntoras de las <strong>comunidades</strong> mayas Ixil y Qiché de las CPR-Sierra de Guatemala (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/CPRsierraGUATEMALA/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/CPRsierraGUATEMALA/</a>), proyecto de colaboración que se mantiene desde 2014. En este espacio de las jornadas se invitará a las participantes a hacer una aportación consciente y voluntaria durante la actividad. Lo recaudado irá destinado a material de acupuntura para este área.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Forma parte de algo grande</h3>
<p>Deseamos el apoyo de la comunidad para materializar este apetitoso evento juntas. El año pasado la financiación fue privada y todo un desafío circense para que se realizarán finalmente las jornadas, es por ello que esta vez llamamos a todas a apoyarnos en este proyecto, desde el lugar donde nos encontramos aquí, ahora, desde nuestro sentir y poder sostener de alguna manera a un grupo de mujeres posicionándose en su valía.</p>
<p>El sueño es recaudar 1,260€ desglosado en lo siguiente:</p>
<p>-440€ para pagar el alquiler del espacio, la maravillosa Fundación Entredós (<a href=""http://fundacionentredos.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://fundacionentredos.org/</a> ), que nos acoge con los brazos abiertos una vez más este año en el centro de Madrid </p>
<p>-250€ para pagar a las 2 colaboradoras que compartirán los talleres de salud.</p>
<p>-250€ para pagar a las 5 artistas colaboradoras involucradas en la parte de arte.</p>
<p>-120€ destinados a cubrir los gastos para la nutrición de las participantes durante el evento (picoteo y té, no comidas principales)</p>
<p>-100€ para pagar el trabajo de coordinación y gestión de las jornadas.</p>
<p>-100€ para pagar la comisión de este plataforma, Indiegogo.</p>
<p>La visión de este proyecto es a su vez cambiar juntas una realidad actual, el desequilibrio económico que sufre el Arte y las Terapias Alternativas. Vemos la oportunidad con esta campaña de invitar a la comunidad a concienciarse junta accionando hacia el cambio que todas deseamos en cuanto al reconocimiento de nuestros dones y servicios y su valoración monetaria. A su vez, la posibilidad de pagar a las colaboradoras y mujeres que ofrecen el espacio permite que se abran las puertas a personas que deseen participar de las jornadas independientemente de su situación económica.</p>
<p>Desde 1€ a todo lo que desees colaborar, desde aquí y ahora te agradecemos por tu generosidad!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Welcome to this campaign!</h3>
<p><br/>My name is Nuria, one of the women behind this juicy project!</p>
<p>My life's path has taken me to this moment, here and now. Finding myself sharing skills to co-create an event for women made by women with the desire to share with the community exactly the same thing that it offers to all of us. From this position that enables to contribute with a personal and creative perspective along with other female collaborators.</p>
<p>The proposal is to repeat an event that took place last summer in Madrid ""Women and Self-Knowledge""; a space to nurture collective consciousness.</p>
<p>The format of the event is co-created through a series of activities taking place over 3 days, where Art and Health are the pillars sustaining it. From Performance to Chinese Medicine, throughout music and food, we will co-create a space for research, listening, exchange and enjoyment.</p>
<p>With your collaboration, you will be supporting not only the realisation of this event but also the transformation of many lives; supporting projects such as this one, created in a self-managed way by the community for the community.</p>
<p>I invite you to take a moment to watch the video from last year:</p>

<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>A unique weekend</h3>
<p>The second edition of this event takes place in August 2019, starting on Friday 2nd in the afternoon. We have an opening circle where a midwife from the Entredos Foundation (the space that will host us) welcomes us. The collaborators and the weekend activities will also be introduced following this. Then we enjoy a marathon of performances where 4 women share their art with the body and its movement. We conclude with a snack to nourish our bonds even more!</p>
<p>On Saturday we begin the day with a 4-hour workshop focused on energy studies from Traditional Chinese Medicine by Acupuntoras Descalzas, school of TCM. After this, we enjoy a space of conscious eating inviting each participant to share their homemade food with the rest. Then, we have a cup of tea listening to the testimony of a woman who opens herself to the intimacy of inspiring others with her biography. Finally we close the day with a music jam guided by a music therapist and a singer, 2 women who hold the space for us and our expression through sound.</p>
<p>On Sunday we start with another 4-hour workshop on Traditional Chinese Medicine, promoting self-management, self-care and self-responsibility. We continue enjoying another meal together and we conclude the day introducing the project Acupuntoras Descalzas, school of TCM, that this year is involved significantly in the event. They will share with us in this space their NGO's project which participates in the promotion of health in indigenous regions, respecting traditional medicines and favouring cultural exchanges between the villages. On this occasion, we will have the privilege to count with the presence of acupuncturists from the Mayan Ixil and Qiché, local CPR-Sierra Guatemala <strong>communities </strong>(<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/CPRsierraGUATEMALA/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/CPRsierraGUATEMALA/</a>). We will encourage the participants to donate a conscious and voluntary contribution during the event to send acupuncture material to this area.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Take part of something bigger</h3>
<p><br/>We envision the support of the community to materialise this exciting event all together. Last year the funding was private therefore challenging to raise funds, which is why this time we call on everyone's contribution to support the project.</p>
<p>The dream is to raise € 1,260 broken down as follows:</p>
<p>-440€ to pay the rent of the space, the wonderful Entredós Foundation (<a href=""http://fundacionentredos.org/%C2%A0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://fundacionentredos.org/ </a>), which welcomes us once again with open arms in the centre of Madrid.</p>
<p>-250€ to pay 2 collaborators who will lead the health workshops.</p>
<p>-250€ to pay 5 collaborating artists involved in the art section.</p>
<p>-120€ destined to cover the expenses of the nutrition of the participants during the event (snacks and tea, not main meals).</p>
<p>-100€ to pay the work of coordination and management of the event.</p>
<p>-100€ to pay the commission of this platform, Indiegogo.</p>
<p>The vision of this project is to change together a current reality, the economic imbalance suffered by Art and Alternative Therapies. We see the opportunity with this campaign to invite the community to become aware and act  upon the change we all want in terms of recognition of our gifts and services and their monetary value. At the same time, the possibility of paying collaborators and women who offer the space, allow everyone to join the event despite any of their financial situation.</p>
<p>From 1€ to your unlimited contributions, here and now we thank you for your generosity!</p>

Any form of contribution and support is welcome with open arms and heart!</p>

Siento el deseo de dar a la comunidad eso mismo que ella ofrece, desde esta particular posición de compartir una perspectiva personal y creativa junto con otras mujeres colaboradoras.
La propuesta es repetir un evento que se llevó a cabo el verano pasado en Madrid; las jornadas intensivas ""Mujer y Autoconocimiento"", un espacio donde nutrir la conciencia colectiva.
La forma se co-crea a través de una serie de actividades que se desarrollan a lo largo de 3 días, donde el Arte y la Salud son los pilares que sostienen las jornadas. Desde la Perfomance a la Medicina China, pasando por la música y la comida co-crearemos un espacio de investigación, escucha, intercambio y disfrute.
Para este segunda edición, tu colaboración ayuda a que proyectos como este, creado de forma auto-gestionada por la comunidad y para la comunidad, sigan siendo posibles. A su vez apoyas con tu generosidad a la transformación de muchas vidas, ya que este es el carácter de las jornadas. 
Te invito a continuación a tomarte un momento para disfrutar del video que reune lo que fueron algunos de los preciados momentos de la primera edición de las jornadas:
 

 
-""Apoyándonos las unas a las otras concretamos el cambio que somos"".

 
Un fin de semana diferente
En Agosto de este verano 2019 nos volvemos a reunir para celebrar de nuevo este hermoso encuentro; comenzamos el viernes 2 por la tarde, tenemos un círculo de apertura donde una matrona de la Fundación  Entredós,  que acoge en su espacio el evento, nos da la bienvenida, se presentan también las colaboradoras y las actividades del fin de semana. A continuación disfrutamos de una maratón de performances donde 4 mujeres comparten su arte desde el cuerpo y el movimiento. Concluimos la tarde con un picoteo para nutrir los vínculos!
El sábado 3 empezamos el día con un taller de 4 horas enfocado a estudios energéticos abordados desde la Medicina Tradicional China a cargo de las Acupuntoras Descalzas, Escuela de Medicina Tradicional China. Después de esto disfrutamos de otro espacio de nutrición desde la alimentación consciente invitando a cada participante a compartir la comida que ha traído desde su casa hecha por ella para compartir con el resto. A continuación nos tomamos el té escuchando el testimonio de 1 mujer que se abre a la intimidad de inspirar con su biografía a otras. Finalmente cerramos la jornada con una jam de música guiada por una musicoterapeuta y una cantante, 2 mujeres que sostienen el espacio para nosotras y nuestra expresión a través del sonido.
El domingo 4 arrancamos con otro taller de 4 horas de Medicina Tradicional China, promoviendo la autogestión, cuidados y auto-responsabilidad de una misma. Volvemos a disfrutar después del espacio de la comida y concluimos las jornadas con un conversatorio y presentación del proyecto Acupuntoras Descalzas, Escuela de Medicina Tradicional China que se encargan este año de involucrarse significativamente en las jornadas, compartiendo con nosotras a su vez el proyecto de su ONG que participa en la promoción de la salud en regiones submedicalizadas, respetando las medicinas tradicionales y privilegiando la aproximación cultural entre los pueblos indígenas. En esta ocasión, contaremos con la presencia de acupuntoras de las comunidades mayas Ixil y Qiché de las CPR-Sierra de Guatemala (https://www.facebook.com/CPRsierraGUATEMALA/), proyecto de colaboración que se mantiene desde 2014. En este espacio de las jornadas se invitará a las participantes a hacer una aportación consciente y voluntaria durante la actividad. Lo recaudado irá destinado a material de acupuntura para este área.

Forma parte de algo grande
Deseamos el apoyo de la comunidad para materializar este apetitoso evento juntas. El año pasado la financiación fue privada y todo un desafío circense para que se realizarán finalmente las jornadas, es por ello que esta vez llamamos a todas a apoyarnos en este proyecto, desde el lugar donde nos encontramos aquí, ahora, desde nuestro sentir y poder sostener de alguna manera a un grupo de mujeres posicionándose en su valía.
El sueño es recaudar 1,260€ desglosado en lo siguiente:
-440€ para pagar el alquiler del espacio, la maravillosa Fundación Entredós (http://fundacionentredos.org/ ), que nos acoge con los brazos abiertos una vez más este año en el centro de Madrid 
-250€ para pagar a las 2 colaboradoras que compartirán los talleres de salud.
-250€ para pagar a las 5 artistas colaboradoras involucradas en la parte de arte.
-120€ destinados a cubrir los gastos para la nutrición de las participantes durante el evento (picoteo y té, no comidas principales)
-100€ para pagar el trabajo de coordinación y gestión de las jornadas.
-100€ para pagar la comisión de este plataforma, Indiegogo.
La visión de este proyecto es a su vez cambiar juntas una realidad actual, el desequilibrio económico que sufre el Arte y las Terapias Alternativas. Vemos la oportunidad con esta campaña de invitar a la comunidad a concienciarse junta accionando hacia el cambio que todas deseamos en cuanto al reconocimiento de nuestros dones y servicios y su valoración monetaria. A su vez, la posibilidad de pagar a las colaboradoras y mujeres que ofrecen el espacio permite que se abran las puertas a personas que deseen participar de las jornadas independientemente de su situación económica.
Desde 1€ a todo lo que desees colaborar, desde aquí y ahora te agradecemos por tu generosidad!
 

 

Otras formas de involucrarte
Todas tenemos una amiga, prima, abuela o pariente lejana dispuestas a apoyarnos en aquellos proyectos que nos conmueven, por ello si resuenas de alguna manera con la propuesta de esta campaña y deseas compartirla con más personas adelante!!! Cualquier forma de contribución y apoyo es acogida con brazos y corazón abierto!
Que las palabras de esta visión te inspiren a creer en tus sueños y en los sueños de otras y apoyarnos confiando que SI se puede! 
Gracias, gracias, gracias!

............................................................................................
Welcome to this campaign!
My name is Nuria, one of the women behind this juicy project!
My life's path has taken me to this moment, here and now. Finding myself sharing skills to co-create an event for women made by women with the desire to share with the community exactly the same thing that it offers to all of us. From this position that enables to contribute with a personal and creative perspective along with other female collaborators.
The proposal is to repeat an event that took place last summer in Madrid ""Women and Self-Knowledge""; a space to nurture collective consciousness.
The format of the event is co-created through a series of activities taking place over 3 days, where Art and Health are the pillars sustaining it. From Performance to Chinese Medicine, throughout music and food, we will co-create a space for research, listening, exchange and enjoyment.
With your collaboration, you will be supporting not only the realisation of this event but also the transformation of many lives; supporting projects such as this one, created in a self-managed way by the community for the community.
I invite you to take a moment to watch the video from last year:


""Supporting one another we become the change we envision.""
 

A unique weekend
The second edition of this event takes place in August 2019, starting on Friday 2nd in the afternoon. We have an opening circle where a midwife from the Entredos Foundation (the space that will host us) welcomes us. The collaborators and the weekend activities will also be introduced following this. Then we enjoy a marathon of performances where 4 women share their art with the body and its movement. We conclude with a snack to nourish our bonds even more!
On Saturday we begin the day with a 4-hour workshop focused on energy studies from Traditional Chinese Medicine by Acupuntoras Descalzas, school of TCM. After this, we enjoy a space of conscious eating inviting each participant to share their homemade food with the rest. Then, we have a cup of tea listening to the testimony of a woman who opens herself to the intimacy of inspiring others with her biography. Finally we close the day with a music jam guided by a music therapist and a singer, 2 women who hold the space for us and our expression through sound.
On Sunday we start with another 4-hour workshop on Traditional Chinese Medicine, promoting self-management, self-care and self-responsibility. We continue enjoying another meal together and we conclude the day introducing the project Acupuntoras Descalzas, school of TCM, that this year is involved significantly in the event. They will share with us in this space their NGO's project which participates in the promotion of health in indigenous regions, respecting traditional medicines and favouring cultural exchanges between the villages. On this occasion, we will have the privilege to count with the presence of acupuncturists from the Mayan Ixil and Qiché, local CPR-Sierra Guatemala communities (https://www.facebook.com/CPRsierraGUATEMALA/). We will encourage the participants to donate a conscious and voluntary contribution during the event to send acupuncture material to this area.

Take part of something bigger
We envision the support of the community to materialise this exciting event all together. Last year the funding was private therefore challenging to raise funds, which is why this time we call on everyone's contribution to support the project.
The dream is to raise € 1,260 broken down as follows:
-440€ to pay the rent of the space, the wonderful Entredós Foundation (http://fundacionentredos.org/ ), which welcomes us once again with open arms in the centre of Madrid.
-250€ to pay 2 collaborators who will lead the health workshops.
-250€ to pay 5 collaborating artists involved in the art section.
-120€ destined to cover the expenses of the nutrition of the participants during the event (snacks and tea, not main meals).
-100€ to pay the work of coordination and management of the event.
-100€ to pay the commission of this platform, Indiegogo.
The vision of this project is to change together a current reality, the economic imbalance suffered by Art and Alternative Therapies. We see the opportunity with this campaign to invite the community to become aware and act  upon the change we all want in terms of recognition of our gifts and services and their monetary value. At the same time, the possibility of paying collaborators and women who offer the space, allow everyone to join the event despite any of their financial situation.
From 1€ to your unlimited contributions, here and now we thank you for your generosity!

 
Other ways to get involved
We all have a friend, cousin, grandmother or relative willing to support us in those projects that move us, so if you feel touched by this campaign in any way and want to share it with more people please don't hesitate to do it! Any form of contribution and support is welcome with open arms and heart!
May the words of this campaign inspire you to believe in your dreams and the dreams of others and support them trusting that INDEED it can be done!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!
*Thank you specially to all the contributors from the first and second edition of this event: Rosa, Andrea, Charlotte, Nieves, Sara, Olivia, Silvia, Marta, Juana, Catarina, Magdalena, Juna, Juana, Gara and Mayte, amongst others!

<h3>HeartFire Summary</h3>
<p>HeartFire Festival combines the best elements of great festival music and performance art with access to genuine spiritual teachers and authentic transformational workshops held in a sacred atmosphere. HeartFire is a new kind of festival-summit for exploring the intersection between art, spirituality, and ecology.</p>
<p>A sacred atmosphere and genuine spirituality is what HeartFire offers above all else. Festival co-founder, Yasha S. Wagner, recalls:</p>
<p>“I remember one massive festival, which included a large encampment of Indigenous elders and Native wisdom-keepers of various nations and tribes . . . They were keeping a large sacred fire for ceremony and prayer, and I’ll never forget the look on their faces as drunk party-goers passed by, throwing cigarette butts in their ceremonial fire and swearing disruptively in that sacred space. . . . I knew then that we needed a festival environment that could better hold and represent our sacred traditions.”</p>
<p>The festival culture of the United States is the living pulse of everything creative and inspiring on the growing-edge of our society—conscious art and music, and a celebration of interspiritual values. But it is also often an excuse for unbounded experimentation and partying that can diminish the profound impact of these spiritual and artistic gifts. </p>
<p>Recognizing the gap and tremendous desire for genuine spirituality among today's youth, HeartFire Festival wishes to give them the best access to genuine spirituality in a truly sacred environment.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>To bring the best musical offerings together with genuine spiritual teaching in a sacred atmosphere for a new generation of spiritual seekers, we need to cover a variety of costs and provide access for those for whom the costs may be prohibitive. We have secured support and funding to cover most of  our infrastructure, as well as costs for our artists and teachers. Now we would like to give back to our participants by offering:</p>
<ul>
<li>10 full scholarships (free tickets) for qualified low-income participants ($2,400)</li>
<li>100 partial scholarships (1/2 price tickets) for low-income participants ($12,000)</li>
<li>Transportation assistance for participants ($1,200)</li>
</ul>
<p>It is with this that we need your help! So much spirituality today is 'leisure spirituality' for people wealthy enough to afford it. Please help support low-income participants by helping us to cover our costs (allowing us to provide them with free and hold price tickets).</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>HeartFire Offerings</h3>
<p>Musical Acts:</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Fragments Theatre is a cultural organization, founded in Jenin, by a group of actors, filmmakers, and technicians who were inspired by Juliano Mer-Khamis, a Palestinian /Israeli Theatre director who was assassinated in 2011.
 
Fragments Theatre wants to give young people the opportunity to express themselves using theatre, film, circus and the arts in Jenin and the surrounding areas. Over the last few years, they have organized several activates with children and young people, producing plays, short films and puppet workshops aimed at encouraging people from Jenin to learn new skills to express themselves in arts and culture.
 
The projects have trained young Palestinian artists, brought international artists and volunteers to work with the local community, built community partnerships, promoted community building, and fostered women’s empowerment. Its projects have also engaged hundreds of young people with the arts in Jenin and the surrounding isolated communities.
So far, the group has produced numerous theatre projects – “Peter Pan in Jenin” Theatre Project (2013), “Windows” Theatre Project (2014), the Cargotopia Art Festival and puppet workshops (2014) , “Chaos in the City” Theatre project (2015), and “A Madman Play (2016/2017). They have toured their work around Palestine, as well as to India and Morocco, Fragments Theatre opened the first Comedy Club in Palestine 2017, Cinema club and trained children in drama therapy.

<h2>Über Circus</h2>
<p>Seit neun Jahren veranstalten wir, Tamara Mascara und das Circus Team, den <strong>Circus.</strong></p>
<p>Spektakuläre Shows von Tamara Mascara und vielen anderen KünstlerInnen aus unserer Szene, sowie Top DJs aus der ganzen Welt, haben Circus zur <i>größten Gay Party Österreichs</i> gemacht. Über 2000 Gäste tanzen bei Circus mehrmals im Jahr bis in die Morgenstunden. Wir sind sehr stolz auf den Beitrag, den Circus für die queere Kultur und das Nachtleben in Wien leistet. Natürlich wollen wir, dass es auch in Zukunft so weitergeht!</p>
<p>Zu Beginn diesen Jahres haben wir mit viel Herzblut und Geld unser erstes Büro mit dazugehörigem „Creative Space“ gemietet. Der ""Creative Space"" ist eine echte Künstlerwerkstätte. Hier wird genäht, hier werden Kulissen gebaut, hier werden Fotos geschossen und Videos gedreht. Der ""Creative Space"" hat sich zum Arbeitsplatz für mehrere junge Mitglieder der LGBTIQ Community entwickelt, die wir bei Circus seit Jahresanfang angestellt haben. Leider mussten wir aufgrund der Sicherheitsmaßnahmen der Bundesregierung gegen die Ausbreitung des COVID-19 Virus den ersten Circus des Jahres absagen. Wir stehen voll und ganz hinter diesen Sicherheitsvorkehrungen, denn die Gesundheit und der Schutz unserer Gäste ist uns natürlich am wichtigsten.</p>
<p>Ihr könnt euch bestimmt vorstellen wie viele Ressourcen wir in dieses Projekt investiert haben. Zur Zeit erhalten wir keine Förderungen oder finanzielle Unterstützungen jeglicher Art und nun haben wir auch keine Einkommensmöglichkeiten, aber laufend weiter Kosten. Somit stehen wir und alle selbstständigen KünstlerInnen wie Drag Queens, DJs und Performer... völlig ohne Einkommen da.</p>
<p>Aus diesem Grund bitten wir euch <u>dringend</u> um Unterstützung, damit auch in Zukunft weiterhin <strong>Circus</strong> - <i>Österreichs größte Gay Party</i> stattfinden kann. <br/> </p>
<h3>Wofür benötigen wir deine Unterstützung?</h3>
<p>Wir möchten voll transparent sein. Unsere Kosten lassen sich in folgende Bereiche kategorisieren:</p>
<ul>
<li>diverse Anzahlungen für Circus - Fresh off the Farm, die nicht rückerstattet werden</li>
<li>Mieten (Büro, Creative Space)</li>
<li>Löhne und Gehälter </li>
<li>Steuern &amp; Sozialabgaben</li>
<li>Versicherungen</li>
<li>Honorare für KünstlerInnen, Drag Queens, DJs, FotografInnen, Aushilfen jeglicher Art etc. </li>
<li>Marketing und Werbung</li>
<li>Wareneinkäufe</li>
<li>Bank- und Indiegogo-Gebühren</li>
</ul>
<p>Zusätzlich möchten wir LGBTIQ-KünstlerInnen unterstützen, die sich in besonders prekären Situation befinden, wenn es die Summe der eingenommenen Spenden erlaubt. </p>

<h2>About Circus</h2>
<p>Circus - Austria's biggest gay party - has been taking place since 2011 and attracts LGBTIQ-visitors from all over Europe to Vienna with a spectacular show by Tamara Mascara. We are very proud of the contribution Circus makes to queer culture &amp; nightlife in Vienna and we would like to improve it in the future with more projects and events and offer the community more diversity, cohesion and of course entertainment.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, we rented our first office space as well as our ""creative space"", hired staff and have been working tirelessly over the past months to organize the next Circus event, which we now had to cancel with a heavy heart. The reason for this is the measures taken by the German government regarding the containment of COVID-19. We fully support these security measures, as the health and protection of our guests is of course our number one priority. </p>
<p>You can imagine how many resources we have invested in this project. At the moment we do not receive any subsidies or financial support of any kind and now we have no income opportunities. Therefore we and all independent artists like drag queens, DJs and performers, who mostly live from hand to mouth without a safety net, are facing existential threats.</p>
<p>For this reason we urgently ask for your support so that Circus - Austria's biggest gay party can continue to take place in the future. </p>
<h3>
<br/>What do we spend the donations on?</h3>
<p>We want to be fully transparent. Our costs can be categorized in the following areas:</p>

<p>In return and as a thank you for your donation we have thought about several rewards. There are different packages with different rewards and donation amounts.

<h3>Background and Story</h3>
<p>We are Maeve Athanasiadis and Dionys ""Dio"" Gallagher, a pair of rock-hoppers from the Belt. Born to a life of hardship, we were never very good at mining. Or engineering, really - when our ship broke down, it broke hard, and the towing fees to Tycho Station nearly wiped us out. We couldn't afford to repair our ship, the Black Moon, or <i>Mung Belék</i>, so we decided to follow our secret passion and converted it into a bar. Now we're parked at Dock 73Y, slinging drinks out of our cargo hold. <br/><br/>It turns out we're way better at bartending than we ever were at mining, and we love it. Our creative drinks, true Belter hospitality, and novel (if cramped) location have earned us the admiration of dockworkers, engineers, and visiting customers alike. As one of the hottest bars on Tycho, we're expanding, but we need your help to keep things running and the drinks flowing.  </p>

<h3>What We're Doing</h3>
<p>This will be a suite party at WorldCon 76 in San Jose this August, themed around the Belter culture from the award-winning book and TV series <i>The Expanse. </i>The party will run on August 17th and 18th (Friday and Saturday nights). This is an expanded and improved version of the Belter Bar that some of us ran at BayCon 2017, when Daniel Abraham and Ty Franck, the authors of <i>The Expanse</i> were guests of honor at the con, and spent quite a while attending our bar, enjoying the decor and drinks, and generally having a good time.<br/><br/>When you walk in, you'll be entering the most immersive <i>Expanse</i> experience we can create, with great drinks made on the spot as well as Belter language and culture. We invite everyone - Belters, Martians, Earthers, and those who haven't chosen a faction - to join us in space for an evening! <br/><br/>Donations will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supplies of alcohol, mixers, and food;</li>
<li>Decorations that provide an immersive, atmospheric experience (""Those look like the same string lights we had on our set,"" observed Ty Franck, co-author of <i>The Expanse</i>, at the last party)</li>

<p>Note - While our goal says $500 due to minimum requirements on Indiegogo, that is our stretch goal. Ideally we're hoping to raise $150 - this will help us heaps as it is!</p>
<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Musoka Live is a group of nine teenagers (14-19) from Melbourne, Australia. We have all had involvement within the Melbourne Cosplay Community for many years through individual and group projects, but have come together to form the little family we call Musoka.</p>
<p>We've been working hard since November 2016, honing in our skills to give the best performances we can - and have finally come out of the shadows to announce the group and set a date for our debut. We are planning to have a meet up of cosplayers from Melbourne on the 8th of April, where we will make our debut and perform for the first time together. This is a really big step for us and will hopefully set the tone for our group to continue well into the future - this is a passion project and we've all become so close over the last few months. While organising permits with the council for our performance and meet, we hit a bit of a hurdle - the cost of the permit is $470. This may not seem like much, but for nine teen students, some who don't have jobs and live out of home, it's  a hefty amount. Not only is it a struggle to come up with this financially, but it takes away from future cosplay plans that we all want to save for - reducing the amount of performances and photoshoots we can reasonably do this year. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've been doing the calculations and worked out that if we can raise just $150 out of the total amount required, splitting the remaining total between the nine of us will bring the cost down that we have to put in to $35 each. This is much more achievable for us - and means that we can push on with practicing and performing rather than worrying about affording the permit. All the funds will go towards paying this permit, regardless of if we reach our goal or not. Any amount helps us bring down that individual cost, and in turn helps us to better afford and save for future cosplays and better practice spaces, bigger performance venues, etc. If we reach over our goal, this will continue to fund the permit, and if by chance we are funded more than the permit requires we will use this extra amount to buy future cosplays for the group.</p>
<p>We also have some really cool perks lined up for those of you who donate! This includes polaroid photos of the group in cosplay, updates on our practices, early previews of our performance and more! We hope you'll consider donating to us, it would mean a huge deal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While we simply all love performing and have similar interests in cosplay, anime and pop culture at large, Musoka is also about entertaining others and bringing a bit of positivity and friendship to the community. There's been plenty of negativity around the world lately, and we want to do our part to help remedy that. By donating to help us get this debut off the ground, you're enabling us to fully focus on giving the best performance we possibly can. It means a huge deal to us, and we hope by continuing to perform and spread Love Live's positive message of friendship, sticking together and helping one another to truly shine we can influence people within the cosplay community and the general public to be kinder, happier and to let their individuality shine. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The challenges we may face are less people than anticipated showing up to our debut. While there are over fifty people that have RSVP'd to our event, Facebook allows people to elect their interest rather than outright selecting that they can definitely attend so we aren't able to accurately pinpoint how many attendees we will actually have. The best way we can overcome this is by spreading the word - we are pretty actively involved in the cosplay community so are able to call in plenty of friends to make noise about our event and bring their friends, just like the characters in Love Live Sunshine had to do for their debut! We know no group debut or any performance for that matter is without risk - whether that be that our performance isn't good enough or any other reason - but we are practicing so often and planning everything to the nth degree to ensure we have the best chance of having a great performance that hopefully increases our popularity and notoriety as a group. The more people that know and like us, the more performances we can continue to have and the more new content we can bring out.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have the financial capability to donate, don't stress! Even just sharing the link around is a huge help - the more people that see this the better! Statistically that would make our chances of hitting our goal so much higher - if 30 people donated $5 each we would make our goal easily. Even just coming to our Meet/Debut on April 8th at the Treasury Gardens in Melbourne, Victoria would mean a lot to us. Support of any kind is crucial to our continued success!</p>

We also have some really cool perks lined up for those of you who donate! This includes polaroid photos of the group in cosplay, updates on our practices, early previews of our performance and more! We hope you'll consider donating to us, it would mean a huge deal.

The Impact
While we simply all love performing and have similar interests in cosplay, anime and pop culture at large, Musoka is also about entertaining others and bringing a bit of positivity and friendship to the community. There's been plenty of negativity around the world lately, and we want to do our part to help remedy that. By donating to help us get this debut off the ground, you're enabling us to fully focus on giving the best performance we possibly can. It means a huge deal to us, and we hope by continuing to perform and spread Love Live's positive message of friendship, sticking together and helping one another to truly shine we can influence people within the cosplay community and the general public to be kinder, happier and to let their individuality shine. 

Risks & Challenges
The challenges we may face are less people than anticipated showing up to our debut. While there are over fifty people that have RSVP'd to our event, Facebook allows people to elect their interest rather than outright selecting that they can definitely attend so we aren't able to accurately pinpoint how many attendees we will actually have. The best way we can overcome this is by spreading the word - we are pretty actively involved in the cosplay community so are able to call in plenty of friends to make noise about our event and bring their friends, just like the characters in Love Live Sunshine had to do for their debut! We know no group debut or any performance for that matter is without risk - whether that be that our performance isn't good enough or any other reason - but we are practicing so often and planning everything to the nth degree to ensure we have the best chance of having a great performance that hopefully increases our popularity and notoriety as a group. The more people that know and like us, the more performances we can continue to have and the more new content we can bring out.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't have the financial capability to donate, don't stress! Even just sharing the link around is a huge help - the more people that see this the better! Statistically that would make our chances of hitting our goal so much higher - if 30 people donated $5 each we would make our goal easily. Even just coming to our Meet/Debut on April 8th at the Treasury Gardens in Melbourne, Victoria would mean a lot to us. Support of any kind is crucial to our continued success!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

CMI now annually provides a unique and intense chamber music experience to local musicians, both children and adults, who may not have ever been exposed to chamber music.</p><p>In conceiving of CMI, we decided one core aspect of this program would be a concert series the artists perform. We planned four free community concerts throughout the week of CMI because we wanted to provide CMI program participants and the community at large with the opportunity to hear high-quality chamber music performance alongside the daily educational activities the participants engaged in. One of concerts the first year was a new music concert called ""Charles Ives and His Living Legacy"" featuring the music of Ives alongside living composers. It was a hit! Our community loved the idea that their hometown hero spurring an entire tradition of American concert music and also meeting the composers who were carrying on that tradition. In 2016, we expanded our series from 4 concerts to 6, programmed more contemporary music, and had our first ever composer-in-residence, Robert Beaser. Today, we are beyond excited to announce that after consulting with the Charles Ives Society, our concert series is now officially the Charles Ives Concert Series, which is committed to exploring the legacy of Ives and his music. </p><p>In the broadest of terms, our goal is to celebrate Ives' legacy by transforming the musical life of the Danbury area. With your help, we can begin to make Danbury a place known not just for its hometown composer, but for its numerous performances of today's American composers powered by a concert series that regularly features dynamic and unique emerging artists performing their works alongside the music of Ives and music that transcends the traditional boundaries of classical music to incorporate other styles - an ""Ivesian"" tradition.  In just two years, we've performed and/or premiered the work of almost 30 American composers and are poised to hit 40 by the end of the year. We can envision a future in Danbury where this series is not only a hub for American music, but one in which this series is a Danbury area cultural icon. </p><p>We realize this is a long road, but it's one we're excited about traveling and your contributions to this launch fund allow us to chart a course that gets us to our destination.</p><h2><strong>We're trying to raise $5,000 to transform Danbury's musical life. Here's how we get started: </strong></h2><p><strong>1.

These passes will NOT get you into annual events such as RambleGRUE, Philly GRUE, or intensive workshops such as Graydancer and Naiia's Power Exchange Intensive or the DomWithLens Photo Afternoon. Party passes: For intensive workshops, you'll receive party passes, which will allow you to enter the after-party on the day of the intensive! These passes are automatically included with your intensive ticket, and are not usable on other events.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

<li>Girls in bikinis looking fine</li>
<li>Most people in rare form</li>
<li>New friendships</li>
<li>Some stories to not tell the kids when you are older</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>As you can imagine some planning and foresight goes in to this event. We need your help to get the necessary supplies. We need at least $600 to get this party going. The more we raise the more things we can get.</p>

<ul>
<li>Two new loud ass speakers</li>
<li>Trash bags (Let's try to keep it clean)</li>
<li>Party games</li>
<li>A lot of cups</li>

<li>Partying with our friends and letting loose is part of our culture. Keep it loose baby.</li>
<li>Summer 2017 only comes round once.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>

<ul>
<li>You are responsible for the things you bring on to the beach.</li>
<li>Fighting is frowned upon and everyone will chant ""asshole"" as you get shunned and thrown out.</li>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This day is what you make it and you can help by lending a hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bring your Kan Jam or cornhole if you have it. The more the merrier. It's sort of like a tailgate on the beach.</li>
<li>Come early and dig a sand table that can be utilized in a variety of ways. I will dig one but I probably won't dig two.</li>

They’re building communities, extending empathy, bringing laughter, and making the dishes just way more pleasant to wash. We (the people who started PodCon) are fascinated by all of this, and we love this art form.In 2017, we gathered fans, creators, and industry in one place to celebrate podcasts. Whether it’s news, interview, scripted, comedy, advice, true crime, gaming, fiction, or nonfiction storytelling, it’s new, it’s exciting, and we love it. The first PodCon was amazing. Now, January 19th and 20th, we are doing it again.PodCon features live podcasts, panel discussions, workshops, connections, networking opportunities, mashups, and meet and greets. It's an event designed for creators, fans, and industry, and every session is open to all attendees. PodCon is brought to you by co-founders Hank Green, Joseph Fink, Jeffrey Cranor, Travis McElroy, and Justin McElroy.Podcasting is a broad medium, which is a fancy way of saying that there are a LOT of people podcasting. Some have humongous audiences, others do not. And many people with smaller audiences nonetheless have more passionate and engaged listeners. If you have suggestions for people you think we should invite or ideas for content in general, we would love to hear from you! Please fill out this form.The more backers we get, the more podcasters we can bring out to PodCon. We'll be announcing new guests regularly throughout the campaign (and afterward) to our backers.For less reliable updates, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Cascade, and Berfd.Live PodcastsYou know, like when a podcast happens but there are a bunch of people in the room? These will also include our patented (not really) Podcast Scrambles where we take two unrelated hosts and force them to create a one-off podcast together. It's magic, and it is one of our favorite things we did last year.Panel DiscussionsWe've got challenges, so we've got DISCUSSIONS! These might be cultural, technological, financial, or social, or maybe even a combination of those things. We need to talk this stuff out in the moments when we can, and hopefully do it in a way that is entertaining for both creators and fans.WorkshopsWe all want to learn from the best. Whether that's writing fiction, capturing truth in audio, community building, or technical skills (no one wants to sound like they recorded on a toaster), we'll have experts at PodCon talking you through it.WeirdnessWe tend to find that, when you get a lot of talented, creative people in the same building, things just happen. We start asking our guests for ideas and suddenly there are improv gaming sessions, puppet shows, role playing games, and who knows what else.Remember:Even if you are unable to attend PodCon, you can get all of this stuff in your podcast feed with a secret RSS feed if you pledge at our ""Remote Attendance"" level. Do I have to have a podcast to attend?Oh no! The majority of stuff at PodCon is for fans of podcasts (which, of course, includes everyone who makes podcasts.) All of our main-stage content is, in our opinion, enjoyable even if you've never listened to a podcast. And even the panels or workshops that we have at PodCon aimed at people who are creating podcasts, we hope, will be interesting for diehard fans who want a peak behind the curtain. What if the IndieGoGo doesn’t reach its goal?There are some things we want to do that we won't be able to do, but the show will go on! As more money comes in, we're able to invite more podcasters and expand the scope of the event. Everything we've promised here so far is definitely happening.Will I be able to get this stuff after the IndieGoGo ends?Tickets will still be available (though they will go up in price) as well as swag bags and the remote attendance podcast feed. Everything else is campaign-only!  Will there be live shows at PodCon?Yep!What about Night Vale and The Adventure Zone?Because of the complexity of those shows, they will be hosting off-site shows that will be separately ticketed.Can I upgrade my perk in the future if I have more money?The way to do this would be to cancel the original perk and buy the new perk while the campaign is still going on. Unfortunately, there is no easy way to upgrade perks.I have a podcast, can I get involved?Obviously, there are a huge number of amazing and popular podcasts out there. We’re looking to represent a broad range of podcasts in both size and genre, but of course, we can’t feature everyone. You can fill out this form to let us know you’re interested.Can I suggest a podcast?Yes! Of course. Please fill out this form.I’m thinking about coming alone, is that OK?Definitely. We will have an optional gathering for lone attendees if you want to attempt to break the ice with some other people. I can't get to Seattle!!We’ve got a “Remote Attendance” perk just for you! We will not be able to stream any of PodCon live, but “Remote Attendance” backers will get access to a password protected podcast link. All recorded content from PodCon including live podcasts, mashups, and panels will be delivered into your favorite podcast listening software. I (or a company I represent) would like to help more than $900 worth of help and am interested in sponsorship.EMAIL US THAT SOUNDS REALLY GREAT info@podcon.comHow does priority seating work?Before a panel or event begins, a priority seating area will be set aside. These seats are not assigned, and there is a chance that they will all fill. They will have a better than average view of the stage / content, and they will be fairly numerous. Ten minutes before the content is scheduled to begin, these sections will be opened to all attendees, so your seat is only saved if you show up before the content, not forever. Will there be a chance for meet-ups and autographs?Yes!

<p><i>""Mahabharabbit""</i>, our community musical theatre is a completely handmade and essentially interactive cross-art project. It is an original play that is going to be performed by <strong>more than 60 participants in Mytilene and Mantamados, two towns of Lesvos, on 4th and 6th of May, 2018. </strong>Two intercultural choirs,<strong> </strong>""Cantalaloun"" and ""Polyphonica Aegean"" take part. These choirs have been set up in 2016 on Lesvos island and are kindly supported by Mosaik Support Centre for refugees and Lesvos Primary Education Directorate. Community artists, such as  Body Percussion group KEKEÇA, Fred Normal, Yioula Koutsoumpou and Stefanos Filos are closely collaborating and have contributed to this particular project's implementation. Inspired by the <i>Cataclysm </i>myth found in many cultures and parts of the world, such as in the Hindu epic ""Mahabharrata"", our contemporary narration shows a global garbage flood as a result of excessive consumption and self centerness of the 21st century. <strong>Our play is crossing borders of all kinds</strong>: languages, cultures, generations, artistic fields, between performers and audience, between professionals and amateurs. In the new land where we land after flying over the current Catastrophe, our pigeons-children spread the message of solidarity, respect, love and creativity as the main solution that can actually save us.</p>

<h3>manchester MODERN</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480538983/wwl29evum9s6t02lsrlf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Manchester Modern is a labour of love. Richard Brook began the project in 1996 with a Samsung compact camera, bought from the Argos catalogue – it had the most features and the most extensive zoom range for the cheapest price. He is honest when he states ‘I had no idea what I was doing’; fortunately, he continued. He knew that his fascination with things others found ugly would be worthwhile one day.</p>
<p>This publication has been promised and considered for a long time and has regularly stalled due to lack of funds and an unwillingness on his part, and that of Vaseem Bhatti (the designer), to compromise over the design and manufacture of this guidebook. It is conceived as a field guide, small enough to fit in your pocket, but weighty enough to know its merit. Times have caught up with Richard and what he once considered obscure and rare groove is now (as you know) populist and media friendly. Regardless, the honesty and integrity of this project as a printed and published object is retained and this single opportunity to buy into 20 years of work by one of the leading thinkers and researchers of mainstream modern architecture is presented here.<br/><br/>Steadily, Richard has built a reputation in academic circles and amongst aficionados as a passionate and informed expert in the architecture of the region and of the provinces. That isn’t to say he doesn’t like London, but there’s an established and ready focus upon the architectural narratives of the capital and a distinct sense that the provinces have long been understudied and underexposed. In Manchester Modern we present 111 buildings of the twentieth and early twenty first century, lovingly photographed and researched over, as stated, the last twenty years.</p>
<p>Vaseem is an artist of pedigree and defined the distinctive visual identity of Warp Records’ hip-hop off shoot, Lex Records, as well as being instrumental in the definition of Manchester’s Skam Records and their aesthetic presence in virtual and printed media. He founded EHQuestionmark and has worked with Richard in one form or another for the best part of fifteen years. This coming together of academic and artist has been made possible by the Modernist Society and we are proud to be able to aid Richard and Vaseem in finally delivering this publication, that is long overdue.<br/><br/>The buildings contained in this catalogue have each been visited at least three times by Richard to attain the correct light conditions for his photography. The retrieval of contemporary journal articles in relation to each has meant numerous trips to the RIBA Library in London to access material no longer held in Manchester. The working hours attached to the delivery of the content, let alone the post-editing and design, run into the thousands and in honesty Richard is unable to quantify just what proportion of his life this has consumed. This is a one off print run and will not be reproduced as a second edition, this is your chance to support the continued works of the Modernist Society and to buy into the passion and dedication of one of our most esteemed collaborators.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480546137/lhhsykzm4j8tevgxu1cf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We have had a little help from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and a huge input from Richard and Bhatti but in order to get this unique book printed we need to raise a further £7500.</p>
<p>This money will pay for a one off and limited edition print run.</p>
<p>You can help us achieve this by taking up one of our special 'perks'</p>
<ul>
<li>Cardboard</li>
<li>PVC</li>
<li>Concrete</li>
<li>Flesh</li>
</ul>
<p>The book is conceived as a field guide and as a collectors object and is available in three formats:</p>
<p>Cardboard: The ‘basic’ object is A6 landscape (26x153x111mm), with 240 pages of vanilla white 150gsm uncoated stock lithographed in black and white, and finished with a silver ink highlight.

Manchester Modern is a labour of love. Richard Brook began the project in 1996 with a Samsung compact camera, bought from the Argos catalogue – it had the most features and the most extensive zoom range for the cheapest price. He is honest when he states ‘I had no idea what I was doing’; fortunately, he continued. He knew that his fascination with things others found ugly would be worthwhile one day.
This publication has been promised and considered for a long time and has regularly stalled due to lack of funds and an unwillingness on his part, and that of Vaseem Bhatti (the designer), to compromise over the design and manufacture of this guidebook. It is conceived as a field guide, small enough to fit in your pocket, but weighty enough to know its merit. Times have caught up with Richard and what he once considered obscure and rare groove is now (as you know) populist and media friendly. Regardless, the honesty and integrity of this project as a printed and published object is retained and this single opportunity to buy into 20 years of work by one of the leading thinkers and researchers of mainstream modern architecture is presented here.Steadily, Richard has built a reputation in academic circles and amongst aficionados as a passionate and informed expert in the architecture of the region and of the provinces. That isn’t to say he doesn’t like London, but there’s an established and ready focus upon the architectural narratives of the capital and a distinct sense that the provinces have long been understudied and underexposed. In Manchester Modern we present 111 buildings of the twentieth and early twenty first century, lovingly photographed and researched over, as stated, the last twenty years.
Vaseem is an artist of pedigree and defined the distinctive visual identity of Warp Records’ hip-hop off shoot, Lex Records, as well as being instrumental in the definition of Manchester’s Skam Records and their aesthetic presence in virtual and printed media. He founded EHQuestionmark and has worked with Richard in one form or another for the best part of fifteen years. This coming together of academic and artist has been made possible by the Modernist Society and we are proud to be able to aid Richard and Vaseem in finally delivering this publication, that is long overdue.The buildings contained in this catalogue have each been visited at least three times by Richard to attain the correct light conditions for his photography. The retrieval of contemporary journal articles in relation to each has meant numerous trips to the RIBA Library in London to access material no longer held in Manchester. The working hours attached to the delivery of the content, let alone the post-editing and design, run into the thousands and in honesty Richard is unable to quantify just what proportion of his life this has consumed. This is a one off print run and will not be reproduced as a second edition, this is your chance to support the continued works of the Modernist Society and to buy into the passion and dedication of one of our most esteemed collaborators.

What We Need & What You Get

We have had a little help from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and a huge input from Richard and Bhatti but in order to get this unique book printed we need to raise a further £7500.
This money will pay for a one off and limited edition print run.
You can help us achieve this by taking up one of our special 'perks'

Cardboard
PVC
Concrete
Flesh

The book is conceived as a field guide and as a collectors object and is available in three formats:
Cardboard: The ‘basic’ object is A6 landscape (26x153x111mm), with 240 pages of vanilla white 150gsm uncoated stock lithographed in black and white, and finished with a silver ink highlight. Each case study building is presented across a single spread with two photographs and a descriptive text. The hardback cover is an uncoated grey recycled 2000micron board which is debossed both front and back, with a spine bound by a white foil-blocked, black canvas tape. The casebound sewn pages can be temporarily bookmarked with an orange ribbon, a colour that references the corporate identity of Greater Manchester Transport in the 1970s.PVC: The ‘field guide’ version comes with a custom designed PVC jacket, into which the ‘basic’ object is inserted. This robust sleeve is intended to provide weather protection in the damp climes of the north-west. Also inserted in the front inner of this jacket is a paper map plotting all the locations. There will only be 100 copies of the ‘field guide’ version.Concrete: The 'concrete deluxe' collectors edition comes with a custom formed concrete book cover, (with no PVC jacket) and will be limited to only 20 copies.
Flesh: Meet the author in the flesh and let him personally guide you around a selection of buildings. Richard will avail you of his expert knowledge for just five specially curated tours - oh, and you also get the book (and some additional treats to be announced later).

<br/><strong>WHEN is the festival? September 26th-29th.<br/><br/>Where is the festival? Clarksville, Ohio. Just North of Cincinnati <br/><br/><br/>What makes Pagan Fires Special?</strong>
</h3>
<p>There are many options when it comes to how you might spend your time, but we hope you consider spending it with us! Pagan Fires is a family friendly camping festival that is organized by a professional staff with over fifty years of combined experience in planning community events. At Pagan Fires, you can expect to see a professional staff that has done all the work so you and your family can enjoy yourselves with a tribe of like-minded people. We welcome well behaved adults, mature kids, and all those who are searching for a community.</p>
<p>The word Pagan encompasses a wide range of spiritual traditions and practices that can’t be seen elsewhere. We don’t always see eye to eye on how to worship or who to worship, but we stand united as group of outliers, facing a world that rarely shares our values. It is more often that society tells us that our differences separate us, but we Pagans know that diversity gives us strength. Perhaps more importantly, that separateness is an illusion.<br/> </p>

Its narrow dirt streets were lined not with the handsome brick buildings we see today, but with simple one- and two-story wooden structures. It was anchored by a single general store and sawmill. This was the beginning of Seattle, and Pioneer Square was at its heart.</p><p>Then it all burned down. Literally.</p><p>It was called the Great Seattle Fire, and for good reason. Blazing for several hours on June 6, 1889, it obliterated Pioneer Square and caused a whopping $20 million in damage (that would be about $527 million in today’s dollars).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491492184/oy8sxirmtf3k20lwywcm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491492208/kkuowzwbxw08rr7g086l.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Despite the devastation, Seattle’s business owners sprang into action to rebuild their city. Not only did they accomplish it within two years, they also made a fascinating decision along the way. To fix Pioneer Square’s sewer and drainage problems, they opted to raise the elevation of the street an entire floor, creating hollow spaces between the old and new sidewalks. Then, to make these spaces usable and bring in some sunlight, they embedded prism glass in sidewalks throughout the neighborhood.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491492251/tjtfursoanhr0texxkjl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>And just like that, a loveable—and colorful—feature of Seattle was born.</p><p>Today, the glass prisms come in many shapes and sizes, but they all have two things in common: 1) they’re super old, and 2) they’re falling apart. When one breaks or falls through the sidewalk, property owners often fill in the holes with concrete. And in some cases, entire panels have been asphalted over.</p><p>Few cities have a collection of prism sidewalks like Seattle’s.

The cause that transforms communities from places where we live into places that we love. As the leading voice for preservation, we are the cause for people saving places.</p><p>Our mission is to protect significant places representing our diverse cultural experience by taking direct action and inspiring broad public support.</p><p><strong>Where is my donation going?</strong></p><p>More than 90% of all funds raised will support the cities' projects and the National Trust’s ongoing work to save historic places in Seattle and around the country. Up to 10% will cover Indiegogo costs and processing fees as described in Indiegogo’s Terms and Conditions.</p><p><strong>When will I get my perk (non-ticket)?</strong></p><p>Perks will be delivered later this summer (July/August).</p><p><strong>Can I visit the project site? </strong></p><p>Yes! You can visit Pioneer Square and specifically Smith Tower, where you can see existing damaged prisms wrapping around the corner on 2nd Avenue and Yesler Way. You are encouraged to visit the second location at Occidental Avenue South and South King Street. Since these prisms are asphalted over, you’ll have to suffice with a good “before” pic. Thanks to your help, you can even visit the site when these are brought back to their original, historic beauty.</p><p><strong>When will the project be complete?</strong></p><p>Saving places takes time! But with your generous support, we hope to get the Pioneer Square project completed as soon as possible.</p><p><strong>How do I get support for my project? Or can I submit a project for consideration?</strong></p><p>We at the National Trust are always interested in hearing about what is important to you.

Its narrow dirt streets were lined not with the handsome brick buildings we see today, but with simple one- and two-story wooden structures. It was anchored by a single general store and sawmill. This was the beginning of Seattle, and Pioneer Square was at its heart.Then it all burned down. Literally.It was called the Great Seattle Fire, and for good reason. Blazing for several hours on June 6, 1889, it obliterated Pioneer Square and caused a whopping $20 million in damage (that would be about $527 million in today’s dollars).Despite the devastation, Seattle’s business owners sprang into action to rebuild their city. Not only did they accomplish it within two years, they also made a fascinating decision along the way. To fix Pioneer Square’s sewer and drainage problems, they opted to raise the elevation of the street an entire floor, creating hollow spaces between the old and new sidewalks. Then, to make these spaces usable and bring in some sunlight, they embedded prism glass in sidewalks throughout the neighborhood.And just like that, a loveable—and colorful—feature of Seattle was born.Today, the glass prisms come in many shapes and sizes, but they all have two things in common: 1) they’re super old, and 2) they’re falling apart. When one breaks or falls through the sidewalk, property owners often fill in the holes with concrete. And in some cases, entire panels have been asphalted over.Few cities have a collection of prism sidewalks like Seattle’s. That’s why we think they deserve some much-needed TLC, and with your help, we can make it happen.Success! We're happy to report that our campaign raised $41,250! That's $26,250 above our original goal of $15,000!Thanks to the generous support of our backers, we'll fully restore prisms located at the iconic Smith Tower on 2nd Avenue and Yesler Way. Additionally, we’ll reveal the paved-over panels at Occidental Avenue South and South King Street. Using these locations as examples, we’ll work with the Alliance for Pioneer Square to show downtown property owners how their prisms can be brought back to life. Through it all, we’ll demonstrate how the prisms are an integral part of both Pioneer Square’s legacy and Seattle’s story overall.Please stay tuned to the updates section of this page for additional project news.I claimed tickets to the Bruno Mars: 24K Magic World Tour as my perk and have questions. Thank you for supporting our project! You will find answers to your questions in our FAQ. If you have specific questions about how to redeem your tickets, please email fulfillment@lifeinmobile.com. Enjoy the show!What is the National Trust for Historic Preservation?The National Trust for Historic Preservation, a privately funded nonprofit organization, works to save America’s historic places. We are the cause that inspires Americans to save the places where history happened. The cause that connects us to our diverse pasts, weaving a multi-cultural nation together. The cause that transforms communities from places where we live into places that we love. As the leading voice for preservation, we are the cause for people saving places.Our mission is to protect significant places representing our diverse cultural experience by taking direct action and inspiring broad public support.Where is my donation going?More than 90% of all funds raised will support the cities' projects and the National Trust’s ongoing work to save historic places in Seattle and around the country. Up to 10% will cover Indiegogo costs and processing fees as described in Indiegogo’s Terms and Conditions.When will I get my perk (non-ticket)?Perks will be delivered later this summer (July/August).Can I visit the project site? Yes! You can visit Pioneer Square and specifically Smith Tower, where you can see existing damaged prisms wrapping around the corner on 2nd Avenue and Yesler Way. You are encouraged to visit the second location at Occidental Avenue South and South King Street. Since these prisms are asphalted over, you’ll have to suffice with a good “before” pic. Thanks to your help, you can even visit the site when these are brought back to their original, historic beauty.When will the project be complete?Saving places takes time! But with your generous support, we hope to get the Pioneer Square project completed as soon as possible.How do I get support for my project?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Matt Gilbert. I'm Gwich'in Athabascan. I'm 40 years old. I have a Bachelors Degree in English-Rhetoric from the University of Alaska Anchorage and a Masters of Arts in Rural Development from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. I grew up in Arctic Village, Alaska, but spent my whole youth travelling and living all over the country and driving across Canada and even visiting England.  I gave up the Modern life and travels, to come home and work for my tribe 12 years ago and this Gwich'in Regional Map is the last of my work with my people. I hope to resume my modern life in the world. </p>
<p>The regional Gwich'in map project chose me, because eight years ago. I realized my grandpa's older brother Kias Peter Sr. who was my neighbor turned 95 and no one ever talked to him. I did not want him to die with all his knowledge, so I brought a traditional placename map over to him. He began working with me right away with a small grant.</p>
<p>What I thought was going to be a 2 week project with a local village map, turned into an eight year regional project with many adventures, obstacles, and honors.  </p>
<p>I gave up Ivy League Schools, jobs, potential relationships and careers to finish this project. I gave up leaving the state for great opportunities in the states for this job. It may sound bizarre, but its all true. These are the sacrifices I made to complete this project. What kept me going everyday is the reality that my life at 95 years (I hope like Kias), is nothing compared to a 10,000 year-old culture that is about to disappear. </p>
<p>Its been eight years and the project is almost done.  The project bounced to every government agency in the Interior, Tanana Chiefs Conference, Council of Athabascan Tribal Governments, US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, and even the University of Alaska Fairbanks, but the funding has run out. </p>
<p>You will help me finish this eight year project and complete the first Gwich'in Regional Mapbook in history, the University of Alaska Press has expressed strong interest in publishing it. They are already in review of my Gwich'in climate report. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $800 to pay for one more month of rent in Fairbanks, because it will take that long to get the last of the project completed. My rent is $625 and I will use the rest of the $175 for groceries. I have been renting a house by the university, so I can access the Gwich'in materials in the archives to finish this project. </p>
<p>For perks I was going to do Gwich'in Postcards for anyone donating over a $100. There have already been two. I just had them printed yesterday. </p>
<p>If I do not make the amount, I will use what you do contribute for groceries as I finish the project in Arctic Village. Its just better working in the city, because I don't hae to worry so much about the labor of a cabin. Hahaha. I can focus and get this done quickly, so I can have time to begin summer work and then, move on with my life. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I wrote briefs on the reports and I tried to move out-of-state twice, but the project haunted me into coming back to Alaska, because its so unique, special, important, and my Elders entrusted me with their knowledge and I had to disseminate it.  There hasn't been maps like this one. There are plenty of Native Placenames map made in most Native communities in Alaska, but rarely, has anyone used these placename maps like I did and go deeper to make travel narratives and document trails. I am at the last 5 feet from the Finish Line. I am one month from being done and you will assist me. </p>
<p>As you all know, I have a great track record, I've built tribal libraries, courthouses, taught my Native language, assisted in saving my reservation from foreclosure, assisted Gwich'in leaders protecting the lands, and restoring Elder stories to my school, and I now have a series of books being published.  This doesn't include all the accomplishments I had in college, so I have done a lot of things in my life to draw upon to prove I am a leader who gets things done. </p>
<p>I will attempt to include a photo of volume one. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main obstacle is poverty and time, I don't have a lot of time, because I want to get a real job, which I had, but gave up to do this project, and lack of resources or real support from the university and tribes. Poverty is always the main obstacle, but I have overcome it for eight years to get this far, so I am confident I will go all the way despite poverty, no real support from the tribes or the university. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There are no other ways you can help, but to donate to my campaign. You can buy a copy of the book when it does get released by the University of Alaska Press. </p>
<p>Please don't share the campaign too much, because I targeted my fundraisers and its only a 5 day campaign. </p>

What kept me going everyday is the reality that my life at 95 years (I hope like Kias), is nothing compared to a 10,000 year-old culture that is about to disappear. 
Its been eight years and the project is almost done.  The project bounced to every government agency in the Interior, Tanana Chiefs Conference, Council of Athabascan Tribal Governments, US Fish & Wildlife Service, and even the University of Alaska Fairbanks, but the funding has run out. 
You will help me finish this eight year project and complete the first Gwich'in Regional Mapbook in history, the University of Alaska Press has expressed strong interest in publishing it. They are already in review of my Gwich'in climate report. 

What We Need & What You Get
I need $800 to pay for one more month of rent in Fairbanks, because it will take that long to get the last of the project completed. My rent is $625 and I will use the rest of the $175 for groceries. I have been renting a house by the university, so I can access the Gwich'in materials in the archives to finish this project. 
For perks I was going to do Gwich'in Postcards for anyone donating over a $100. There have already been two. I just had them printed yesterday. 
If I do not make the amount, I will use what you do contribute for groceries as I finish the project in Arctic Village. Its just better working in the city, because I don't hae to worry so much about the labor of a cabin. Hahaha. I can focus and get this done quickly, so I can have time to begin summer work and then, move on with my life. 

The Impact
I wrote briefs on the reports and I tried to move out-of-state twice, but the project haunted me into coming back to Alaska, because its so unique, special, important, and my Elders entrusted me with their knowledge and I had to disseminate it.  There hasn't been maps like this one. There are plenty of Native Placenames map made in most Native communities in Alaska, but rarely, has anyone used these placename maps like I did and go deeper to make travel narratives and document trails. I am at the last 5 feet from the Finish Line. I am one month from being done and you will assist me. 
As you all know, I have a great track record, I've built tribal libraries, courthouses, taught my Native language, assisted in saving my reservation from foreclosure, assisted Gwich'in leaders protecting the lands, and restoring Elder stories to my school, and I now have a series of books being published.  This doesn't include all the accomplishments I had in college, so I have done a lot of things in my life to draw upon to prove I am a leader who gets things done. 
I will attempt to include a photo of volume one. 

Risks & Challenges
The main obstacle is poverty and time, I don't have a lot of time, because I want to get a real job, which I had, but gave up to do this project, and lack of resources or real support from the university and tribes. Poverty is always the main obstacle, but I have overcome it for eight years to get this far, so I am confident I will go all the way despite poverty, no real support from the tribes or the university. 

Other Ways You Can Help
There are no other ways you can help, but to donate to my campaign. You can buy a copy of the book when it does get released by the University of Alaska Press. 
Please don't share the campaign too much, because I targeted my fundraisers and its only a 5 day campaign.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>The West Virginia Mine Wars Museum in Matewan, WV, is a grassroots people’s history museum that honors the legacy of labor organizing in the Appalachian coalfields. And right now, we are dreaming of an <strong>EPIC celebration</strong>.</p>
<p>Over <strong>Labor Day Weekend in 2021</strong>, we are banding together with partners from all over the state, region, and nation to commemorate the Centennial of the <strong>largest armed insurrection in U.S. History since the Civil War.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542589947/ncylkpkvii3szs1rls48.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Battle of Blair Mountain was a complicated, inspiring, and tragic event that pitted coal miners and their supporters against unfair and often illegal working and living conditions, enforced by their bosses with the support of many government officials. Over five days, 10,000 participants battled on Blair Mountain before surrendering to U.S. soldiers.  </p>
<p><strong>Like you, we KNOW that this history has national significance.<br/>We KNOW that this history can draw visitors from all over the globe to West Virginia.<br/>We KNOW that we can only do it if, like the unionist miners, we work together.</strong></p>
<p>With enough organization, planning, and $$$, we can accomplish something truly special in 2021.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>To ensure that the Centennial reaches as wide an audience as possible, we’re asking you to join the ranks of big names like <strong>James Earl Jones, Chris Cooper, and David Straithern</strong>—actors in the 1987 John Sayles film ""Matewan""—and many more, who have already pledged their time and support. (Fun Fact: James Earl Jones was this campaign’s first donor!)</p>

They still have the person’s mark on them, and when you hold them, you feel less alone. — Aimee Bender</i></p><p>The Artisan Sector of India provides the most beautiful and celebrated arts, crafts, and handloom items. Even though it is the second largest employment industry, it faces multiple challenges, which are damaging traditional art forms.</p><p>Negligible funding, lack of technology and marketing opportunities, and the flood of imitations and machine-made clothing items that don traditional designs in the tourist markets have discouraged artisans. The Indian corporate gifting sector has even become overrun with Chinese goods.</p><p>The Traditional Art Entrepreneurship Summit 2018 (TAES) serves to empower the artisan businesses of India and increase India’s share in global handmade demands.</p><p>Over 50 entrepreneurs are selected annually to participate in the TAES series of conferences, workshops and exhibition where they learn about marketing and branding to make their products export-ready. Once this is completed, they will be a part of our website <a href=""http://www.taesindia.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>TAESIndia.org</u></a>. These entrepreneurs will also receive funding to participate in an organized traveling exhibition to promote and sell their goods.</p><p><strong>Why TAES 2018? </strong></p><p>This campaign will financially support the multiple Artisan Organizations that participate in TAES 2018. We seek to use the power of the digital world to connect Indians to their roots and art lovers around the world to thoughtfully created Indian products. Our <a href=""http://taesindia.org/shop/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TAES Online Store</a> will generate business for the participating artisans to help them achieve sustainability in future.</p><p>When you shop global, you bring the influence of another country into your life. Buying direct from artisans puts them in control of what they earn for their work, and with the opportunity to share their unique creations with the global marketplace they become empowered to manage their own success.</p><p>When you support TAES, you support our goal to involve Indian and foreign interest in this story of growth, support, and sustainability and spread knowledge of the Sanctity of Heritage Arts of India. Connecting artisans and buyers on a global scale also brings a better social life to the region and a confidence to artisans to continue in their craft.</p><p>All contributions are rewarded with a piece of handcrafted love as you become a part of the movement to take India’s artisan businesses global! Choose from beautifully handmade sculptures, paintings, sandals, jewelry, scarfs and other clothing items and make them your own!</p><p><strong>How the Funds will be Utilized: </strong></p><p>The funds raised use the following distribution format:</p><p>For every <strong>1000 USD </strong>raised:</p><p><strong>100 USD</strong> goes toward Raw Materials,</p><p><strong>550 USD</strong> toward Artisan Remuneration,</p><p><strong>300 USD</strong> toward Marketing, Branding and Skill Development for global outreach </p><p><strong>50 USD</strong> goes toward Artisan Welfare programs.</p><p>Under the welfare component, we dedicate funds to the overall wellbeing of artisans, with a special focus on eye care, an area most affected in the handmade sector.</p><p><strong>Risks and Challenges:</strong></p><p>At the completion of the campaign, all products are then ordered from the participating Artisan Organizations. We will work hard to produce your desired product as close as possible to the displayed photograph. We kindly request that you celebrate any minor variations as the uniqueness of each handmade product.

They still have the person’s mark on them, and when you hold them, you feel less alone. — Aimee BenderThe Artisan Sector of India provides the most beautiful and celebrated arts, crafts, and handloom items. Even though it is the second largest employment industry, it faces multiple challenges, which are damaging traditional art forms.Negligible funding, lack of technology and marketing opportunities, and the flood of imitations and machine-made clothing items that don traditional designs in the tourist markets have discouraged artisans. The Indian corporate gifting sector has even become overrun with Chinese goods.The Traditional Art Entrepreneurship Summit 2018 (TAES) serves to empower the artisan businesses of India and increase India’s share in global handmade demands.Over 50 entrepreneurs are selected annually to participate in the TAES series of conferences, workshops and exhibition where they learn about marketing and branding to make their products export-ready. Once this is completed, they will be a part of our website TAESIndia.org. These entrepreneurs will also receive funding to participate in an organized traveling exhibition to promote and sell their goods.Why TAES 2018? This campaign will financially support the multiple Artisan Organizations that participate in TAES 2018. We seek to use the power of the digital world to connect Indians to their roots and art lovers around the world to thoughtfully created Indian products. Our TAES Online Store will generate business for the participating artisans to help them achieve sustainability in future.When you shop global, you bring the influence of another country into your life. Buying direct from artisans puts them in control of what they earn for their work, and with the opportunity to share their unique creations with the global marketplace they become empowered to manage their own success.When you support TAES, you support our goal to involve Indian and foreign interest in this story of growth, support, and sustainability and spread knowledge of the Sanctity of Heritage Arts of India. Connecting artisans and buyers on a global scale also brings a better social life to the region and a confidence to artisans to continue in their craft.All contributions are rewarded with a piece of handcrafted love as you become a part of the movement to take India’s artisan businesses global! Choose from beautifully handmade sculptures, paintings, sandals, jewelry, scarfs and other clothing items and make them your own!How the Funds will be Utilized: The funds raised use the following distribution format:For every 1000 USD raised:100 USD goes toward Raw Materials,550 USD toward Artisan Remuneration,300 USD toward Marketing, Branding and Skill Development for global outreach 50 USD goes toward Artisan Welfare programs.Under the welfare component, we dedicate funds to the overall wellbeing of artisans, with a special focus on eye care, an area most affected in the handmade sector.Risks and Challenges:At the completion of the campaign, all products are then ordered from the participating Artisan Organizations. We will work hard to produce your desired product as close as possible to the displayed photograph. We kindly request that you celebrate any minor variations as the uniqueness of each handmade product. The production process may last up to 30 days, with an additional 12-14 working days for shipping across the world. Your reward should reach your doorstep by the end of August.

<h2>WHAT IS BURN IT DOWN?</h2>
<p>Burn it Down is a filmmaking collective that provides emerging filmmakers the rare opportunity for experiential learning.

<p>Now in our third season, we are leveling up! We've been getting by on our scrappiness, and for the first time ever we're fundraising to provide resources for our growing community and programming.</p>

<p>The flagship Workshop Wing is a chance for filmmakers to learn a new aspect of filmmaking or work on developing a skill by meeting regularly to make a scrappy short film. </p>
<p>The new Production Wing builds on the existing goals of the Burn it Down workshops by essentially creating a fuller film production experience.

<h2>What is Art-Festival 2019?</h2>
<p>Art-Labyrinth Summer Festival is a unique event, held in Moldova in wild nature. It happens every summer for 11 years in a row. We create “5-days-world” far from public places and consuming ideology. World full of creativity, art, self-development, ecological thinking.<br/>More than 50 workshops, 2 musical stages, team of volunteers, no entrance fee – all of these to change something in our society. To form space for community, friendship, sharing and love.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553295561/osm4y5wdpexpjbrkjypu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>
<br/>Our goals</h2>
<p>- Create free space for creativity, art, consciousness and ecological thinking</p>
<p>- Give masters and artists possibility to share their knowledge, teach something interesting</p>
<p>- Promote community, friendship, love, closeness to nature – purity inside and around</p>
<p>- Inspire ecological awareness, spiritual and self-development</p>
<p>- Using only free donations, improve mentality of ""sharing"" and non-consuming values</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What do we do?</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553295632/ut6bluqrsryscv0esnfk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It all started in 2008. We couldn't imagine then, that idea of getting artists and interesting people together in the wild, far away from city could have had such impact and become popular. A lot of people came around 500 people and it was ""wow!"" for that moment! Now we have 1000-1500 guests every year.</p>
<p>Every year we search for a new place. Place should be far from localities and, most important there should be wild nature and magic. The feeling of living a real life, of being in the moment, just here and now. The place is main ""participant"" of the Festival.</p>
<p>Cultural program includes over 50 workshops: fire-show, music concerts, African dances and drums, yoga, workshops for children and many other. Sometimes a person comes, makes a drum and just takes it home.</p>
<p>Non-commercial, non-consuming approach - this is Art Labyrinth's main idea. Being away of ""buy/sell"" way of thinking - that's it. It's when a person comes and feels that it's not a place where he's seen as a money bag. No advertisement banners here ever!</p>
<p>Art Festival is common creation, made by good people who form reality based on consciousness and beauty.</p>
<h2>Why Indiegogo?</h2>
<p>We've always had minimal entrance fee and, of course, it wasn't enough for ever-increasing budget. Some years ago, Festival became so big that we faced serious financial crisis. We made two more Festivals, but every time getting in serious debts. Now, in 2019, our team has to choose: either increase the fee greatly, or we tell 'no' to any compromise with commercial reality and make Festival with free contribution, being sure that people love and appreciate our work. Free contribution means that everybody gives as much as he wants to.</p>
<p>So now, we start a campaign on Indiegogo to raise funds for Art-Labyrinth 2019. This website is based on the main idea we appreciate so much – sharing. Collected resources will help us much to repair and buy equipment, tools, materials, to organize transport, buy tickets for artists and masters, food, make posters and many other.</p>
<p>The more fund we raise, the better Festival we can create with more interesting and diverse program. We open our hearts, inviting people to create this Festival with us,to become a part of our big family, our team. The very spirit of the Festival will change spirit at the root, becoming more authentic, genuine, closer to it's initial idea.</p>
<h2>What is money spent on?</h2>
<p>Last time due to bad weather and some organizational issues, we finished our Festival with great debts. Here you can see list of our costs.</p>
<p>Last years we've spent aproximately 10.000 euros to make Festival. Asking for funding, we hope to raise half of this sum, which will help us to start preparing for the Festival. Second half will consists of people's donations on Festival itself.<br/> What are we going to spend money on?</p>
<p>1200 – purchasing of supplies, instruments, repairing instruments;</p>
<p>600 – preventive assistance and repair of equipment (audio/sound systems, generators)</p>
<p>600 – advertisement, posters, flyers, programmes, web-site works</p>
<p>1200 – transport rent (freight transport for technique, food, transport for volunteers)</p>
<p>1400 – SeedCamp food (for volunteers who build the Festival (20 people for 15 days)</p>
<p>400 – fuel costs</p>
<p>800 – money for transport tickets for artists and craftsmen (masters)</p>
<p>We advocate for full financial transparency! List of donors is going to be posted on our web-site (<a href=""http://fest.art-labyrinth.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://fest.art-labyrinth.org/</a>) and social networks. Same scheme for donations during the Festival itself.*</p>
<p>*At will of donor we can hide the name and leave just the sum of donation.</p>

<h2>Что такое Арт-Лабиринт Фестиваль?</h2>
<p>Летний Фестиваль Арт-Лабиринт - это уникальное событие, которое проводится каждый год в Молдове. 11 лет подряд мы создаём свой мир, на природе, вдалеке от городского шума и потребительской идеологии. 5 дней наполненных творчеством, искусством, саморазвитием и экологически осознанным отношением к природе.</p>
<p>Более 50 мастер-классов, 2 музыкальные сцены, большая команда волонтёров, отсутствие  фиксированной платы за вход – всё это делается для того, чтоб поменять что-то в нашем обществе. Пускай на небольшой период, но создать пространство, в котором главное – дружба, осознанность, любовь и саморазвитие.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Наши цели</h2>
<p>- Создать пространство для творчества, искусства, осознанности и бережного отношения к природе</p>
<p>- Дать возможность мастерам, артистам и гостям поделиться своими знаниями и опытом</p>
<p>- Поддерживать идеи общности, дружбы, любви, близости к природе – чистота снаружи и чистота внутри</p>
<p>- Продвигать экологическую осознанность, саморазвитие и духовный поиск</p>
<p>- Используя принцип свободного взноса, уйти от потребительского отношения и создать возможность честного и чистого взаимообмена энергией</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Чем мы занимаемся?</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553295867/naw5dstdn20zbkq61xxh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Всё началось в 2008 году. Мы не могли предположить, что простая идея собрать творческих людей на природе, сделать фестиваль альтернативной культуры и искусства, свободный от коммерции, рекламы, добавив йогу и эко-ценности, может быть настолько востребованной, и востребованной в Молдове!</p>
<p>Сразу же, на первом фестивале в 2008 году нас было около 500, сейчас нас собирается до двух тысяч. Большой фестиваль для нашей маленькой страны.</p>
<p>Каждый год мы ездим на разведки, чтоб найти новое место. Место должно быть как можно дальше от населённых пунктов и, главное, там должна быть дикая природа и в ней чувствоваться магия. Место – главный «участник» фестиваля.</p>
<p>Всё на волонтёрских началах, целая команда волонтёров, вкладывается огромное количество сил, времени и собственных финансов.</p>
<p>Культурная программа насчитывает более 50 мастер-классов: фаер-шоу, музыкальные концерты, африканские танцы и игра на барабанах, йога, детские мастер-классы, мастер-град, где делают изделия из кожи, глины и многое другое.</p>

What is Art-Festival 2019?
Art-Labyrinth Summer Festival is a unique event, held in Moldova in wild nature. It happens every summer for 11 years in a row. We create “5-days-world” far from public places and consuming ideology. World full of creativity, art, self-development, ecological thinking.More than 50 workshops, 2 musical stages, team of volunteers, no entrance fee – all of these to change something in our society. To form space for community, friendship, sharing and love.


Our goals
- Create free space for creativity, art, consciousness and ecological thinking
- Give masters and artists possibility to share their knowledge, teach something interesting
- Promote community, friendship, love, closeness to nature – purity inside and around
- Inspire ecological awareness, spiritual and self-development
- Using only free donations, improve mentality of ""sharing"" and non-consuming values
 
What do we do?

It all started in 2008. We couldn't imagine then, that idea of getting artists and interesting people together in the wild, far away from city could have had such impact and become popular. A lot of people came around 500 people and it was ""wow!"" for that moment! Now we have 1000-1500 guests every year.
Every year we search for a new place. Place should be far from localities and, most important there should be wild nature and magic. The feeling of living a real life, of being in the moment, just here and now. The place is main ""participant"" of the Festival.
Cultural program includes over 50 workshops: fire-show, music concerts, African dances and drums, yoga, workshops for children and many other. Sometimes a person comes, makes a drum and just takes it home.
Non-commercial, non-consuming approach - this is Art Labyrinth's main idea. Being away of ""buy/sell"" way of thinking - that's it. It's when a person comes and feels that it's not a place where he's seen as a money bag. No advertisement banners here ever!
Art Festival is common creation, made by good people who form reality based on consciousness and beauty.
Why Indiegogo?
We've always had minimal entrance fee and, of course, it wasn't enough for ever-increasing budget. Some years ago, Festival became so big that we faced serious financial crisis. We made two more Festivals, but every time getting in serious debts. Now, in 2019, our team has to choose: either increase the fee greatly, or we tell 'no' to any compromise with commercial reality and make Festival with free contribution, being sure that people love and appreciate our work. Free contribution means that everybody gives as much as he wants to.
So now, we start a campaign on Indiegogo to raise funds for Art-Labyrinth 2019. This website is based on the main idea we appreciate so much – sharing. Collected resources will help us much to repair and buy equipment, tools, materials, to organize transport, buy tickets for artists and masters, food, make posters and many other.
The more fund we raise, the better Festival we can create with more interesting and diverse program. We open our hearts, inviting people to create this Festival with us,to become a part of our big family, our team. The very spirit of the Festival will change spirit at the root, becoming more authentic, genuine, closer to it's initial idea.
What is money spent on?
Last time due to bad weather and some organizational issues, we finished our Festival with great debts. Here you can see list of our costs.
Last years we've spent aproximately 10.000 euros to make Festival. Asking for funding, we hope to raise half of this sum, which will help us to start preparing for the Festival. Second half will consists of people's donations on Festival itself. What are we going to spend money on?
1200 – purchasing of supplies, instruments, repairing instruments;
600 – preventive assistance and repair of equipment (audio/sound systems, generators)
600 – advertisement, posters, flyers, programmes, web-site works
1200 – transport rent (freight transport for technique, food, transport for volunteers)
1400 – SeedCamp food (for volunteers who build the Festival (20 people for 15 days)
400 – fuel costs
800 – money for transport tickets for artists and craftsmen (masters)
We advocate for full financial transparency! List of donors is going to be posted on our web-site (http://fest.art-labyrinth.org/) and social networks. Same scheme for donations during the Festival itself.*
*At will of donor we can hide the name and leave just the sum of donation.
 
How you can help

This event is our spiritual masterpiece, unique project, based on teamwork of hundreds of people in general. We only rely upon work of volunteers and society feedback. This crowdfunding campaign is also a try to invite people from different countries and cultures to join us.

Что такое Арт-Лабиринт Фестиваль?
Летний Фестиваль Арт-Лабиринт - это уникальное событие, которое проводится каждый год в Молдове. 11 лет подряд мы создаём свой мир, на природе, вдалеке от городского шума и потребительской идеологии. 5 дней наполненных творчеством, искусством, саморазвитием и экологически осознанным отношением к природе.
Более 50 мастер-классов, 2 музыкальные сцены, большая команда волонтёров, отсутствие  фиксированной платы за вход – всё это делается для того, чтоб поменять что-то в нашем обществе. Пускай на небольшой период, но создать пространство, в котором главное – дружба, осознанность, любовь и саморазвитие.
 
Наши цели
- Создать пространство для творчества, искусства, осознанности и бережного отношения к природе
- Дать возможность мастерам, артистам и гостям поделиться своими знаниями и опытом
- Поддерживать идеи общности, дружбы, любви, близости к природе – чистота снаружи и чистота внутри
- Продвигать экологическую осознанность, саморазвитие и духовный поиск
- Используя принцип свободного взноса, уйти от потребительского отношения и создать возможность честного и чистого взаимообмена энергией
 
Чем мы занимаемся?

Всё началось в 2008 году. Мы не могли предположить, что простая идея собрать творческих людей на природе, сделать фестиваль альтернативной культуры и искусства, свободный от коммерции, рекламы, добавив йогу и эко-ценности, может быть настолько востребованной, и востребованной в Молдове!
Сразу же, на первом фестивале в 2008 году нас было около 500, сейчас нас собирается до двух тысяч. Большой фестиваль для нашей маленькой страны.
Каждый год мы ездим на разведки, чтоб найти новое место. Место должно быть как можно дальше от населённых пунктов и, главное, там должна быть дикая природа и в ней чувствоваться магия. Место – главный «участник» фестиваля.
Всё на волонтёрских началах, целая команда волонтёров, вкладывается огромное количество сил, времени и собственных финансов.
Культурная программа насчитывает более 50 мастер-классов: фаер-шоу, музыкальные концерты, африканские танцы и игра на барабанах, йога, детские мастер-классы, мастер-град, где делают изделия из кожи, глины и многое другое.
Некоммерческий подход - основной принцип Арт-Лабиринта.Альтернатива ""городской"" действительности, Когда человек, приезжая к нам, чувствует - это не то место, где на нем ""хотят заработать"". Попадая к нам, люди чувствуют, что всё, что здесь делается и происходит, не ради заработка и выгоды, ни в коем случае. Мотивация у всей команды, артистов, волонтеров другая, более чистая.
11 лет мы творим, 11 лет собираем людей всех национальностей, рас, вероисповеданий и возрастов, чтоб создать фестиваль наполненный творчеством, осознанностью, экологичностью и душой. Почему Indiegogo?
Несколько лет назад, повышая общее качество Фестиваля, мы увеличили обороты, и финансовый вопрос обострился. Плата за вход была минимальной и она не покрывала всех затрат. Мы сделали ещё два фестиваля, но каждый раз уходили в сильный минус.
Теперь же, в 2019, перед нами стал выбор - либо сильно поднимать взнос, либо отказаться от компромиссов и, поверив в то, что Арт-Лабиринт любят и ценят, сделать взнос свободным, по принципу ""каждый дает сколько хочет"". Эта концепция – возвращение к истокам, к базовым ценностям фестиваля. При таком подходе, вовлеченность, причастность, вся атмосфера фестиваля - всё меняется. Становится именно таким, каким нам хотелось бы видеть - большое общее дело хороших людей, создающих красивую, осознанную реальность.
Сейчас мы запускаем кампанию по сбору средств на Арт-Лабиринт Фестиваль 2019 на сайте Indiegogo. Платформа Indiegogo в основе своей содержит как раз наш самый главный принцип – помощь, обмен, дарение. Все собранные средства пойдут на закупку и ремонт материалов, оборудования, инструментов, транспортные расходы, билеты артистам и мастерам, еду, флаеры, афиши и много другого. От того, насколько успешной будет кампания, зависит масштаб самого фестиваля, разнообразие программы.
Мы открываемся людям, приглашая каждого стать частью нашей команды, нашей семьи!
 
На что пойдут ресурсы?
В прошлом году, в силу плохой погоды и проблем с организацией, мы снова вышли в большой долг после фестиваля.Общий бюджет одного Арт-Фестиваля масштабов последних лет составляет около 10 тыс. евро. Через эту кампанию мы рассчитываем собрать около половины - сумма необходимая перед фестивалем для его запуска. Вторую половину бюджета мы рассчитываем покрыть из взносов собранных на самом фестивале. В зависимости от собранной суммы планируется масштаб фестиваля.На что пойдут ресурсы до начала фестиваля?

Система будет максимально прозрачной как до, так и во время фестиваля. Список всех поучаствовавших в общем сборе будет вывешен на нашем сайте и в соцсетях.* На самом фестивале будет работать такая же система учета взносов с последующей отчетностью. Открытость, честность и осознанность.
*По желанию донора, можно указать только сумму и не указывать имя.

<p><u><strong><i>Toda a campanha em português abaixo</i></strong></u></p>
<p><u><strong><i>Toute la campagne en Français ci dessous </i></strong></u></p> <h3><strong>01.10.19 Additional note to the campaign</strong></h3>
<p>As the campaign is entering its home stretch I am adding a short explanation about what the project will receive at the end of the campaign and why:</p>
<p>This campaign is ''fixed funds'', which means that either the target is met by the campaign's deadline and in such case the project receives the funds, or the target is not met by the campaign's deadline and in such case the project does not receive anything and each contributor is reimbursed.</p>
<p>Why such a system?</p>
<p>Because the budget for this campaign is calculated to cover real expenses.</p>
<p>If the project were to receive 30% of the target... it would unfortunately not be able to produce anything of quality.</p>
<p>We want to produce real quality work for you. So we chose all or nothing.</p>
<p>Let it be all :-)</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Alors que la campagne entre dans sa dernière ligne droite, je rajoute ces lignes pour préciser ce que le projet recevra à la fin.</p>
<p>À la fin de la campagne, soit elle aura atteint son objectif et le projet sera financé, soit elle ne l´aura pas atteint et le projet ne recevra aucun fonds (tous les fonds seront alors reversés à chaque contributeur).</p>
<p>Pourquoi un tel système?</p>
<p>Car le budget a été calculé pour couvrir des dépenses réelles.</p>
<p>Si le projet recevait 30%, il ne serait pas possible de produire quoi que ce soit de qualité.</p>
<p>Nous voulons produire un travail de qualité pour tous. Alors nous avons choisi tout ou rien.</p>
<p>A vous de jouer pour que ça soit tout :-)</p>

<h2><strong>The context behind <i>Maningue, Voices of Mozambique</i></strong></h2>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p><strong>During the night of 14 to 15 March and on 25 April 2019, two consecutive cyclones, Idai and Kenneth, hit Mozambique affecting respectively about 1.5 million people and 170.000 people in 6 of the country 10 provinces</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Cyclone Idai:  ""the worst natural disaster to hit southern Africa in at least two decades"", UNICEF</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Beira, a city inhabited by half a million people and surrounds were 90% ""damaged or destroyed"", according to the International Federation of the Red Cross</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Cyclone Kenneth: ""the first time in recorded history two strong tropical cyclones have hit the country in the same season"", UNICEF</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Where does the idea of <i>Maningue, Voices of Mozambique</i> come from?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<div>
<ul><li><strong>The will to keep the information about the cyclones’ aftermaths alive</strong></li></ul>
<p>When both cyclones hit Mozambique, they were widely covered by worldwide news. Nowadays, it seems fair to say that there is much less coverage readily available on them.<i> Maningue, Voices of Mozambique</i> stems from <strong>the will to keep information alive</strong>, and hope to contribute to it.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><p><strong>The will to access to a different type of information </strong></p></li></ul>
<p>The information available has focused on the direct damages caused, and I believe it is an extremely important piece of information to know about. However, <strong>I believe it is also important to know about the personal experiences lived throughout such disasters.</strong><i><strong> </strong>Maningue, Voices of Mozambique</i> stems from the will to know about individual stories and about how the cyclones affected people’s lives, day to day activities, thoughts, and feelings.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><p><strong>The awareness of the importance to have timeless memories of two of the first climate related disasters</strong></p></li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""[Beira] will go down in history as having been the first city to be completely devastated by climate change’’, Graça Machel, former first lady of Mozambique and South Africa</i></p>
<p>The intensity of the cyclones and of their damages was inexorably linked to climate change. <strong>For me, before such disasters become the norm, it is important to provide a testimony of human experiences lived in the aftermaths of two of the first climate related disasters.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><p><strong>The will to give back to a country that has personally given me a lot</strong></p></li></ul>
<p align=""center""><i>“For me, visiting Mozambique is a matter of the heart”, UN Secretary-General António Guterres</i></p>
<p>I spent about 4 years living and working in Mozambique, and I owe a lot to this country and to its people. When the cyclones hit, I felt the impact of the shock for the country, for its people, for my friends and for their relatives deep in my bones. <strong>Today, I want to bring together all the skills and interests I have to pay my respects and do the one thing I am able to do out of all that: collect testimonies and give a voice to people´s journey and thoughts.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565449430/wr7oy1ymtafnkuywcywh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What will <i>Maningue, Voices of Mozambique</i> include?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>Maningue, Voices of Mozambique</i></strong><strong> will include <strong>portraits of a series of people,</strong> their testimonies, </strong><strong>their pictures, </strong><strong>pictures of places which were hit by the cyclones, </strong>as well as brief background chapters on Mozambique and the cyclones.</p>
<p><i>Maningue, Voices of Mozambique</i> will depict<strong> people´s experiences, </strong><strong>individual stories, </strong><strong>reactions, </strong><strong>day to day facts of life, </strong><strong>adaptations, </strong><strong>thoughts, </strong><strong>and feelings in the face of the two disasters and throughout everyday life</strong>.</p>
<p><i>Maningue, Voices of Mozambique</i> shall include <strong>portraits and testimonies of the largest range of people possible, such as</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>people who were most directly affected by the cyclones,</li>
<li>people who first came to support them (national and international),</li>
<li>people who were/have been affected indirectly,</li>
<li>people who are now helping, etc…</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What does Maningue mean?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>‘’Maningue’’ is a colloquial word originating from the native languages spoken mostly in the south of the country. Used as an adverb, ‘’Maningue’’ means ‘’a lot’’ or ‘’very’’. Used as a noun, ‘’Maningue’’ confirms agreement with what was previously said, and can then be translated by ‘’Of course’’, ‘’Oh yeah!’’, or ‘’That´s for sure’’.</p>
<p><strong>One of the sentences you are most likely to hear while visiting Mozambique would be: ‘’Mozambique é maningue nice!’’; which means: ‘’Mozambique is very very nice!’’</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What do we need your help for?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Today <i>Maningue, Voices of Mozambique</i> needs your help to finance the second step of the project: Gathering the testimonies and portraits.</strong></p>
<p>This is <strong>a crucial step for the project</strong>: <strong>a full 6 weeks working time spent within the country in order to interview people, gather their testimonies and images that will feed the book.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where will the money go?</strong></p>
<p>The target of this campaign covers the expenses necessary to carry out the work to be done within Mozambique over a full six weeks period as well as campaign related fees.</p>
<p>Large areas will be covered given that the cyclones hit large areas within the country. The distances to cover will involve national flights within the country as well as long drives with a 4X4 car and a driver used to local roads. Time spent in each area will be critical in order to gain people’s trust and allow sufficient time to conduct quality work.</p>

<h2><strong>Know more about me</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Aude Nowak, I am a 33 years old French citizen. <strong>I am the creator and manager of the project <i>Maningue, Voices of Mozambique</i>. I will be the one carrying the project from A to Z. </strong>I am a multicultural person, with multiple interests and trained in various fields.</p>
<p>I am trained as a <strong>Development Economist, a Sociologist</strong>, and an Hypnologist.</p>
<p>I worked for NGOs, Ministries in developing countries, development agencies, the United Nations, and the private sector as international consultant and development economist. Throughout these positions, I <strong>organized and conducted working missions within six countries, interviewing people and drawing official reports and studies from these interviews</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve always liked to take pictures and my very second job – remaining unlisted on my CV – was as a <strong>photographer</strong>. In more recent years, I have developed my own entrepreneur activities, including writing and hypno-coaching and counseling.</p>
<p>I speak four languages (French, English, Portuguese, and Spanish), and in total, I lived and/or worked in nine countries in my life: <strong>Mozambique</strong>, Laos, India, Sri Lanka, Zambia, Côte d´Ivoire, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and France.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Risks and Challenges for <i>Maningue, Voices of Mozambique</i>, Step 2, and how to overcome them</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>While undertaking the work of Step 2 in Mozambique, the project may run into several challenges. <strong>From the experience I have organizing working missions in various countries, and from the experience I have of Mozambique, I am confident I will be able to manage arising challenges and overcome them to conduct the work as best as possible. </strong></p>
<p>At this stage, I could already identify a few potential challenges and ways to overcome them. First, working at the district and province levels always carry out risks of delays and unforeseen events arising. The <strong>choice and order of the locations to visit</strong>, as well as the way to organize the interviews will both be planned keeping this in mind in order to minimize these risks and to<strong> allow for flexibilities and adaptability</strong>.</p>
<p>Second, on 15 October 2019, Mozambique will held general Elections for President, national parliament, provincial governors and provincial parliaments. In order to facilitate interviews’ organization and participations, <strong>the work will be started in the provinces after the Elections take place</strong>.</p>
<p>Security issues also exist in the Northern part of the country. In order to ensure the driver and my own safety, the final places to be visited in the Northern part of the country will be confirmed <strong>according to the updated security situation at the time of travel</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique </i></strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Retratos e testemunhos após a passagem devastadora de dois ciclones ligados </strong><strong>à mudança climática</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Visão Geral</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Em março e abril de 2019, dois ciclones atingiram Moçambique um após o outro. </strong>Mais de 1,5 milhão de pessoas foram afectadas. Esforços nacionais e internacionais foram rapidamente implementados para resgatar e ajudar as populações afectadas.</p>
<p><strong>O projecto <i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique</i> tem o objectivo de partilhar histórias e experiências individuais vividas após a passagem dos ciclones num livro fotográfico.</strong></p>
<p>Através de uma série de retratos, testemunhos e fotografias, <i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique</i> pretende <strong>dar uma voz às experiências individuais e permitir que a sua memória seja transmitida no tempo.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>O contexto por trás de <i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique</i></strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Durante a noite de 14 a 15 de Março e no dia 25 de Abril de 2019, dois ciclones consecutivos, Idai e Kenneth, atingiram Moçambique afectando respectivamente cerca de 1,5 milhões de pessoas e 170.000 pessoas em 6 das 10 províncias do país.</strong></p>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Ciclone Idai: ""o pior desastre natural a atingir a África Austral em pelo menos duas décadas"", UNICEF</i></p>
<div><p style=""text-align: center;"">Beira, habitada por meio milhão de pessoas, e os seus arredores foram danificados ou destruídos a 90% de acordo com a Federação Internacional da Cruz Vermelha.</p></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Ciclone Kenneth: ""Pela primeira vez na história recordada, dois ciclones tropicais fortes atingiram o país na mesma temporada"", UNICEF</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Como nasceu a ideia de <i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique</i>?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>A vontade de manter viva a informação sobre os ciclones e as suas consequências</strong></li></ul>
<p>Quando os dois ciclones atingiram Moçambique, eles foram amplamente cobertos pelas notícias em todo o mundo. Hoje em dia, parece que há muito menos a informação sobre os ciclones e as suas consequências é muito menos amplamente difundida. <i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique</i> nasceu da <strong>vontade de manter esta informação viva e amplamente difundida, e espera contribuir para isso.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>A vontade de ter acesso a um outro tipo de informação</strong></li></ul>
<p>A informação disponível sobre os ciclones teve por enfoque os danos directamente causados ​​pelos ciclones, e é de facto uma informação extremamente importante para conhecer. No entanto, acho que é também importante saber sobre as experiências pessoais vividas no meio deste desastre. <i>Maningue, Voices of Mozambique</i> nasceu da vontade de <strong>saber mais sobre experiencias humanas individuais e sobre a maneira como os ciclones afectaram a vida das pessoas, as actividades do dia-a-dia, os pensamentos e os sentimentos.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>A consciência da importância de deixar uma memória de dois dos primeiros desastres relacionados com a mudança do clima</strong></li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""[Beira]  vai ficar na história como tendo sido a primeira cidade a ser devastada completamente pelas Mudanças Climáticas"", Graça Machel, ex-Primeira Dama de Moçambique e da África do Sul</i></p>
<p>A intensidade dos ciclones e dos seus danos foi inexoravelmente ligada à mudança climática. Para mim, e <strong>antes que desastres assim se tornem a norma, é importante fornecer um testemunho de experiências humanas vividas após dois dos primeiros desastres ligado à mudança climática </strong>de modo a deixar uma memória das mesmas acessível no futuro.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>A vontade de dar de volta a um país pelo que ele me trouxe</strong></li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>“Para mim, visitar Moçambique é uma questão de coração”, António Guterres, Secretário-Geral da ONU</i></p>
<p>Passei cerca de 4 anos a viver e a trabalhar em Moçambique, e devo muito a este país e ao seu povo. Quando os ciclones atingiram o país, eu senti o impacto do choque para o país, para o seu povo, para os meus amigos e os seus familiares no meu coração. <strong>Hoje, quero reunir todas as capacidades e interesses que tenho para prestar os meus respeitos e fazer a única coisa que possa fazer: colectar retratos e testemunhos e dar uma voz às pessoas</strong>.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>O que <i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique</i> incluirá?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique</i></strong><strong> incluirá retratos de uma série de pessoas, os seus testemunhos, as suas fotos, bem como fotos de lugares que foram atingidos pelos ciclones</strong>. Incluirá igualmente capítulos breves sobre Moçambique e os próprios ciclones.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique</i> contará <strong>experiências de pessoas, histórias individuais, reacções, eventos do dia-a-dia, pensamentos e sentimentos após os dois desastres.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique</i> pretende incluir r<strong>etratos e testemunhos da maior diversidade de pessoas possível, nomeadamente</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>de pessoas que foram directamente afectadas pelos ciclones,</li>
<li>de pessoas que foram das primeiras a resgata-las e apoia-las (nacionais e internacionais),</li>
<li>de pessoas que foram afectadas indirectamente,</li>
<li>de pessoas que estão agora a ajudar seis meses depois, etc</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>O que significa Maningue?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>""Maningue"" é uma palavra coloquial originária das línguas nativas faladas principalmente no sul do país. Como advérbio, ""Maningue"" significa ""muito"". Como nome, ""Maningue"" pode também ser usado para confirmar o acordo com o que foi dito precedentemente. Usado como tal, ""Maningue"" pode ser traduzido por ""Sim!!"", ""Pois!!!"".</p>
<p><strong>Uma das frases mais rapidamente ouvida ao visitar Moçambique é: ""Moçambique é maningue nice!""; o que significa: ""Moçambique é muito bom!""</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Como será realizado <i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique?</i> - Quatro grandes etapas</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568630251/uvikxo3xd7hseaiucyhy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>O que precisamos?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hoje <i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique</i> precisa da sua ajuda para financiar a segunda etapa do projecto: Recolher os testemunhos e retratos.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Esta etapa é uma etapa de primeira importância pelo projecto: um período de<strong> 6 semanas integras de trabalho em Moçambique para entrevistar pessoas</strong>, reunir os seus testemunhos e tirar as suas fotografias e as fotografias dos lugares atingidos pelos ciclones que irão alimentar o livro.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Para que servirá o dinheiro?</strong></p>
<p>O valor de 12 000 euros inclui as despesas necessárias para realizar o trabalho a ser feito em Moçambique durante um período de seis semanas integras, bem como as taxas relacionadas com a campanha de crowdfunding.</p>
<p>Uma vez que os ciclones atingiram grandes áreas dentro do país, <strong>grandes áreas serão cobertas durante este tempo de trabalho no país.</strong> As distâncias e o tipo de estrada a percorrer envolverão voos nacionais, bem como longas viagens de carro 4X4 com um motorista habituado as estradas locais. O tempo passado em cada localidade será fundamental para conquistar a confiança das pessoas e permitir um <strong>tempo suficiente para realizar um trabalho de qualidade</strong>.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Agradecimentos pelo vosso apoio </strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique</i> precisa da vossa ajuda para existir, e pensei numa série de presentes para vos agradecer pelo vosso apoio ao projecto.</p>
<p>Eu pensei muito nos presentes de agradecimento a vos propor. Eu queria que eles respeitem a essência do projecto e que sejam dignos do vosso apoio. Assim sendo, <strong>espero que irão gostar deles e apreciá-los ao máximo.</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Saibam mais sobre mim</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>O meu nome é Aude Nowak, sou uma cidadã francesa de 33 anos. Eu sou a criadora e gestora do projecto <i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique</i>. Eu serei aquela que levará o projecto de A a Z. Eu sou uma pessoa multicultural, com interesses múltiplos e treinada em várias áreas.</p>
<p>Sou formada em <strong>economia de desenvolvimento, sociologia</strong> e hipnose.</p>
<p>Trabalhei para ONGs, ministérios em países em desenvolvimento, agências de desenvolvimento, as Nações Unidas e o sector privado como consultora internacional e economista de desenvolvimento. Dentro das minhas funções, <strong>organizei e levei a cabo missões de trabalho em seis países, entrevistando pessoas e elaborando relatórios oficiais e estudos com base nessas entrevistas.</strong></p>
<p>Eu sempre gostei de tirar fotos e o meu segundo emprego - permanecendo não listado no meu currículo - era como <strong>fotógrafa</strong>.</p>
<p>Nos últimos anos, desenvolvi as minhas próprias actividades empreendedoras, incluindo escritura, e coaching e acompanhamento com base na hipnose.</p>
<p>Eu falo quatro idiomas (francês, inglês, português e espanhol), e no total, vivi e / ou trabalhei em nove países na minha vida: <strong>Moçambique</strong>, Laos, Índia, Sri Lanka, Zâmbia, Costa do Marfim, Reino Unido, Suíça e França.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Riscos e Desafios para a Etapa 2 <i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique</i>, e como superá-los</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Enquanto empreender o trabalho em Moçambique, o projecto de certeza que encontrará desafios. <strong>A partir da experiência que tenho organizando missões de trabalho em vários países, e da experiência que tenho de Moçambique, estou confiante que poderei gerir os desafios emergentes e superá-los da melhor forma possível</strong>.</p>
<p>Nesta fase, já consegui identificar alguns potenciais desafios e formas de superá-los. Em primeiro lugar, a realização de trabalhos a nível distrital e provincial implica sempre um risco de atrasos e imprevistos. A escolha e a ordem dos locais a visitar, bem como a forma de organizar as entrevistas, serão ambos planejados de maneira a minimizar esses riscos e a facilitar uma maior <strong>flexibilidade e adaptabilidade no plano de trabalho</strong> caso isso for necessário.</p>
<p>Em segundo lugar, no dia 15 de Outubro de 2019, Moçambique irá realizar eleições gerais para o Presidente, o parlamento nacional, os governadores provinciais e os parlamentos provinciais. A fim de facilitar a organização das entrevistas e participação às mesmas, <strong>o trabalho será iniciado nas províncias após a realização das Eleições.</strong></p>
<p>Riscos em termos de segurança existem na parte norte do país. A fim de garantir a segurança do motorista bem como a minha, <strong>os locais a serem visitados na parte norte do país serão, portanto, confirmados de acordo com a situação de segurança actualizada no momento da viagem</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Por favor, espalhem a palavra e contribuam a campanha</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Se vocês gostem do projecto, por favor, apoiem-o</strong>, doando, falando sobre ele ao seu redor, gostando e compartilhando esta página e a página da campanha de angariação de fundos. Qualquer nível de doação, qualquer ´´gosto´´, qualquer ´´share´´ será mais um passo para tornar <i>Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique</i> uma realidade.</p>

<h2><strong>Vue d´ensemble</strong></h2>

<p><strong>En mars et avril 2019, deux cyclones dévastateurs ont frappé le Mozambique l´un après l´autre. </strong>Plus de 1,5 million de personnes ont été touchées.</p>

<h2><strong>Comment est née l'idée de Maningue, Voix du Mozambique?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>La volonté de maintenir vivante l´information sur les cyclones et leurs conséquences</strong></li></ul>
<p>Lorsque les deux cyclones ont frappé le Mozambique, ils ont été largement couverts par les médias du monde entier. Aujourd'hui, on peut dire qu´il y a de manière générale beaucoup moins d´informations largement diffusées sur ceux-ci. Maningue, Voix du Mozambique est né de la <strong>volonté de maintenir l’information sur les cyclones en vie et espère y contribuer.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>La volonté d'avoir accès à un autre type d'information</strong></li></ul>
<p>Les informations disponibles sur les cyclones ont principalement porté sur les dommages occasionnés, et ce type d´informations est effectivement extrêmement important à diffuser. Néanmoins, je pense qu´il est aussi important d´en savoir plus sur les expériences personnelles vécues au cœur de cette catastrophe. Maningue, Voix du Mozambique est né de la <strong>volonté d'en savoir plus sur les expériences humaines individuelles et sur l'impact des cyclones sur la vie, les activités, les pensées et les sentiments des gens.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li><strong>La conscience de l’importance de laisser une mémoire de deux des premières catastrophes liées au changement climatique</strong></li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i> ""[Beira] restera dans l’histoire comme la première ville complètement dévastée par le changement climatique"", Graça Machel, ancienne Première Dame du Mozambique et de l’Afrique du Sud</i></p>
<p>L’intensité des cyclones et leurs dégâts ont été inexorablement liés au changement climatique. Pour moi, et <strong>avant que de telles catastrophes ne deviennent la norme, il est important de témoigner des expériences humaines vécues à la suite de deux des premiers événements dévastateurs liés au changement climatique</strong> afin d´en laisser une mémoire accessible dans le futur.</p>
<p> </p>

Aujourd’hui, je souhaite <strong>rassembler toutes les compétences et tous les intérêts que j’ai pour honorer le pays et faire ce que je suis capable de faire pour lui: recueillir des témoignages et donner une voix aux vécus des gens.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Qu´est ce que vous pourrez trouver à l´intérieur de Maningue, Voix du Mozambique?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Maningue, Voix du Mozambique comprendra des <strong>portraits d’un certain nombre de personnes, leurs témoignages, leurs photos, ainsi que des photos de lieux frappés par les cyclones.</strong> Il comprendra également de brefs chapitres sur le Mozambique et les cyclones.</p>
<p>Maningue, Voix du Mozambique relatera des<strong> expériences personnelles, des vécus individuels, des réactions, des événements de la vie quotidienne, des pensées, et des sentiments vécus à la suite des deux catastrophes.</strong></p>
<p>Le but de Maningue, Voix du Mozambique est d’inclure des portraits et témoignages de <strong>la plus grande diversité de personnes possibles</strong>, notamment:</p>
<ul>
<li>des personnes directement touchées par les cyclones,</li>
<li>des premières personnes venues à leur secours (nationaux et internationaux),</li>
<li>des personnes indirectement touchées,</li>
<li>des personnes en train d'aider six mois après, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Que signifie Maningue?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>«Maningue» est un mot familier provenant des langues autochtones parlées principalement dans le sud du pays. Utilisé comme adverbe, il signifie «beaucoup» ou «très». Utilisé comme nom, il confirme un accord avec ce qui a été dit précédemment, et peut alors être traduit par ""Ouais carrément !"".</p>
<p><strong>Une des phrases que vous entendrez le plus facilement au Mozambique est: «Mozambique é maningue nice!»; ce qui signifie: ""Le Mozambique est absolument magnifique!"".</strong></p>

<h2><strong>De quoi le projet a besoin ?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Aujourd'hui, Maningue, Voix du Mozambique a besoin de votre aide pour <strong>financer la deuxième étape du projet: la collecte de témoignages et portraits sur place.</strong></p>
<p>Ce sera un moment crucial pour le projet: <strong>six semaines complètes de travail dans le pays pour discuter avec les gens sur place, recueillir leurs témoignages</strong> et prendre les photos qui alimenteront les portraits et le livre.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A quoi servira l'argent?</strong></p>
<p>La somme de 12 000 euros couvre les dépenses nécessaires à l'exécution du travail au Mozambique sur une période de six semaines complètes, ainsi que les frais liés à la campagne de crowdfunding elle-même.</p>
<p>De grandes distances seront traversées étant donné que les cyclones ont frappé de vastes régions du pays. Les distances et type de routes à parcourir impliqueront des vols nationaux ainsi que de longs trajets avec une voiture 4X4 et un chauffeur connaissant les routes locales. Le temps passé dans chaque lieu sera déterminant pour gagner la confiance des gens et avoir un temps suffisant pour effectuer un travail de qualité.</p>

<p>Je m'appelle Aude Nowak, je suis de nationalité française et j´ai 33 ans. Je suis la créatrice et gestionnaire du projet Maningue, Voix du Mozambique. Je serai celle qui mènera le projet de A à Z. Je suis une personne multiculturelle, je m´intéresse à beaucoup de choses différentes et ai étudié et travaillé dans divers domaines.</p>
<p>Je suis formée en<strong> économie du développement, en sociologie </strong>et en hypnose.</p>
<p>J'ai travaillé pour des ONGs, des ministères dans des pays en développement, des agences de développement, les Nations Unies et le secteur privé en tant que consultante internationale et économiste du développement. Dans le cadre de mes fonctions, <strong>j'ai organisé et géré de nombreuses missions de travail dans différents pays, réalisé de nombreux entretiens auprès de personnes sur place, et rédigé des rapports et études officiels à partir de l´analyse de ces entretiens.</strong></p>
<p>J'ai toujours aimé prendre des photos et mon deuxième travail – qui reste jusqu´à aujourd´hui non précisé sur mon CV – était <strong>photographe</strong>. Ces dernières années, j'ai développé mes propres activités entrepreneuriales, notamment l'écriture, et le coaching et l´accompagnement grâce à l'hypnose.</p>
<p>Je parle quatre langues (français, anglais, portugais et espagnol), et au total, j'ai vécu et / ou travaillé dans neuf pays dans ma vie: au <strong>Mozambique</strong>, au Laos, en Inde, au Sri Lanka, Zambie, en Côte d'Ivoire, au Royaume-Uni, en Suisse et en France.</p>

<h2><strong>Risques et défis de l´ Étape 2 de Maningue, Voix du Mozambique, et comment les surmonter</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Au cours du travail sur place, le projet rencontrera très probablement plusieurs défis. <strong>De par mon expérience d´organisations de missions de travail dans divers pays et mon expérience au Mozambique, j’ai toute confiance que je pourrais identifier et gérer au mieux les défis qui pourraient voir le jour afin de réaliser le travail de la meilleure manière possible.</strong></p>
<p>A ce stade, j'ai déjà pu identifier certains défis potentiels et des moyens de les surmonter. Tout d’abord, travailler au niveau des districts et des provinces comporte toujours des risques de retards et d’imprévus. Le choix et l'ordre des lieux à visiter, ainsi que la manière d'organiser les entretiens, seront planifiés de manière à minimiser ces risques et à permettre d´<strong>être flexible et de pouvoir adapter le plan de travail si nécessaire.</strong></p>
<p>Ensuite, le 15 octobre 2019, le Mozambique organisera des élections générales pour le Président, le parlement national, les gouverneurs de province et les parlements de province. <strong>Afin de faciliter l'organisation des entretiens et de maximiser la participation des gens sur place, le travail dans les provinces sera commencé après la tenue des élections.</strong></p>
<p>Enfin, dans le nord du pays, il existe des risques sécuritaires. Afin de garantir la sécurité du chauffeur et la mienne, le <strong>choix final des lieux à visiter dans le nord sera donc fait en fonction de la situation sécuritaire actualisée au moment du voyage.</strong></p>

Toute la campagne en Français ci dessous  01.10.19 Additional note to the campaign
As the campaign is entering its home stretch I am adding a short explanation about what the project will receive at the end of the campaign and why:
This campaign is ''fixed funds'', which means that either the target is met by the campaign's deadline and in such case the project receives the funds, or the target is not met by the campaign's deadline and in such case the project does not receive anything and each contributor is reimbursed.
Why such a system?
Because the budget for this campaign is calculated to cover real expenses.
If the project were to receive 30% of the target... it would unfortunately not be able to produce anything of quality.
We want to produce real quality work for you. So we chose all or nothing.
Let it be all :-)
----------------------------------------------------------
Alors que la campagne entre dans sa dernière ligne droite, je rajoute ces lignes pour préciser ce que le projet recevra à la fin.
À la fin de la campagne, soit elle aura atteint son objectif et le projet sera financé, soit elle ne l´aura pas atteint et le projet ne recevra aucun fonds (tous les fonds seront alors reversés à chaque contributeur).
Pourquoi un tel système?
Car le budget a été calculé pour couvrir des dépenses réelles.
Si le projet recevait 30%, il ne serait pas possible de produire quoi que ce soit de qualité.
Nous voulons produire un travail de qualité pour tous. Alors nous avons choisi tout ou rien.
A vous de jouer pour que ça soit tout :-)
 
 
The context behind Maningue, Voices of Mozambique
 

During the night of 14 to 15 March and on 25 April 2019, two consecutive cyclones, Idai and Kenneth, hit Mozambique affecting respectively about 1.5 million people and 170.000 people in 6 of the country 10 provinces.
 

Cyclone Idai:  ""the worst natural disaster to hit southern Africa in at least two decades"", UNICEF
Beira, a city inhabited by half a million people and surrounds were 90% ""damaged or destroyed"", according to the International Federation of the Red Cross
Cyclone Kenneth: ""the first time in recorded history two strong tropical cyclones have hit the country in the same season"", UNICEF
 
 
Where does the idea of Maningue, Voices of Mozambique come from?
 

The will to keep the information about the cyclones’ aftermaths alive
When both cyclones hit Mozambique, they were widely covered by worldwide news. Nowadays, it seems fair to say that there is much less coverage readily available on them. Maningue, Voices of Mozambique stems from the will to keep information alive, and hope to contribute to it.
 
The will to access to a different type of information 
The information available has focused on the direct damages caused, and I believe it is an extremely important piece of information to know about. However, I believe it is also important to know about the personal experiences lived throughout such disasters. Maningue, Voices of Mozambique stems from the will to know about individual stories and about how the cyclones affected people’s lives, day to day activities, thoughts, and feelings.
 
The awareness of the importance to have timeless memories of two of the first climate related disasters
""[Beira] will go down in history as having been the first city to be completely devastated by climate change’’, Graça Machel, former first lady of Mozambique and South Africa
The intensity of the cyclones and of their damages was inexorably linked to climate change. For me, before such disasters become the norm, it is important to provide a testimony of human experiences lived in the aftermaths of two of the first climate related disasters.
 
The will to give back to a country that has personally given me a lot
“For me, visiting Mozambique is a matter of the heart”, UN Secretary-General António Guterres
I spent about 4 years living and working in Mozambique, and I owe a lot to this country and to its people. When the cyclones hit, I felt the impact of the shock for the country, for its people, for my friends and for their relatives deep in my bones. Today, I want to bring together all the skills and interests I have to pay my respects and do the one thing I am able to do out of all that: collect testimonies and give a voice to people´s journey and thoughts.
 

 
 
What will Maningue, Voices of Mozambique include?
 
Maningue, Voices of Mozambique will include portraits of a series of people, their testimonies, their pictures, pictures of places which were hit by the cyclones, as well as brief background chapters on Mozambique and the cyclones.
Maningue, Voices of Mozambique will depict people´s experiences, individual stories, reactions, day to day facts of life, adaptations, thoughts, and feelings in the face of the two disasters and throughout everyday life.
Maningue, Voices of Mozambique shall include portraits and testimonies of the largest range of people possible, such as:

people who were most directly affected by the cyclones,
people who first came to support them (national and international),
people who were/have been affected indirectly,
people who are now helping, etc…

 
 
What does Maningue mean?
 
‘’Maningue’’ is a colloquial word originating from the native languages spoken mostly in the south of the country. Used as an adverb, ‘’Maningue’’ means ‘’a lot’’ or ‘’very’’. Used as a noun, ‘’Maningue’’ confirms agreement with what was previously said, and can then be translated by ‘’Of course’’, ‘’Oh yeah!’’, or ‘’That´s for sure’’.
One of the sentences you are most likely to hear while visiting Mozambique would be: ‘’Mozambique é maningue nice!’’; which means: ‘’Mozambique is very very nice!’’
 
 
How will Maningue, Voices of Mozambique be done? – Four Big Steps
 

 
 
What do we need your help for?
 
Today Maningue, Voices of Mozambique needs your help to finance the second step of the project: Gathering the testimonies and portraits.
This is a crucial step for the project: a full 6 weeks working time spent within the country in order to interview people, gather their testimonies and images that will feed the book.
 
Where will the money go?
The target of this campaign covers the expenses necessary to carry out the work to be done within Mozambique over a full six weeks period as well as campaign related fees.
Large areas will be covered given that the cyclones hit large areas within the country. The distances to cover will involve national flights within the country as well as long drives with a 4X4 car and a driver used to local roads. Time spent in each area will be critical in order to gain people’s trust and allow sufficient time to conduct quality work.

 
 
Rewards to thank you for your support!
 
Maningue, Voices of Mozambique needs your help to exist, and I thought of a series of advantages and gifts designed just for you to thank you for supporting the project.
I put a lot of thought into these thank-you gifts in order to respect the essence of the project and to warmly thank you for your support, and I hope that you will enjoy to the fullest :-)

I speak four languages (French, English, Portuguese, and Spanish), and in total, I lived and/or worked in nine countries in my life: Mozambique, Laos, India, Sri Lanka, Zambia, Côte d´Ivoire, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and France.
 
 
Risks and Challenges for Maningue, Voices of Mozambique, Step 2, and how to overcome them
 
While undertaking the work of Step 2 in Mozambique, the project may run into several challenges. From the experience I have organizing working missions in various countries, and from the experience I have of Mozambique, I am confident I will be able to manage arising challenges and overcome them to conduct the work as best as possible. 
At this stage, I could already identify a few potential challenges and ways to overcome them. First, working at the district and province levels always carry out risks of delays and unforeseen events arising. The choice and order of the locations to visit, as well as the way to organize the interviews will both be planned keeping this in mind in order to minimize these risks and to allow for flexibilities and adaptability.
Second, on 15 October 2019, Mozambique will held general Elections for President, national parliament, provincial governors and provincial parliaments. In order to facilitate interviews’ organization and participations, the work will be started in the provinces after the Elections take place.
Security issues also exist in the Northern part of the country. In order to ensure the driver and my own safety, the final places to be visited in the Northern part of the country will be confirmed according to the updated security situation at the time of travel.

Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique 
Retratos e testemunhos após a passagem devastadora de dois ciclones ligados à mudança climática
 
 
Visão Geral
 
Em março e abril de 2019, dois ciclones atingiram Moçambique um após o outro. Mais de 1,5 milhão de pessoas foram afectadas. Esforços nacionais e internacionais foram rapidamente implementados para resgatar e ajudar as populações afectadas.
O projecto Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique tem o objectivo de partilhar histórias e experiências individuais vividas após a passagem dos ciclones num livro fotográfico.
Através de uma série de retratos, testemunhos e fotografias, Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique pretende dar uma voz às experiências individuais e permitir que a sua memória seja transmitida no tempo.
 
 
O contexto por trás de Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique
 
Durante a noite de 14 a 15 de Março e no dia 25 de Abril de 2019, dois ciclones consecutivos, Idai e Kenneth, atingiram Moçambique afectando respectivamente cerca de 1,5 milhões de pessoas e 170.000 pessoas em 6 das 10 províncias do país.

Ciclone Idai: ""o pior desastre natural a atingir a África Austral em pelo menos duas décadas"", UNICEF
Beira, habitada por meio milhão de pessoas, e os seus arredores foram danificados ou destruídos a 90% de acordo com a Federação Internacional da Cruz Vermelha.
Ciclone Kenneth: ""Pela primeira vez na história recordada, dois ciclones tropicais fortes atingiram o país na mesma temporada"", UNICEF
 
 
Como nasceu a ideia de Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique?
 
A vontade de manter viva a informação sobre os ciclones e as suas consequências
Quando os dois ciclones atingiram Moçambique, eles foram amplamente cobertos pelas notícias em todo o mundo. Hoje em dia, parece que há muito menos a informação sobre os ciclones e as suas consequências é muito menos amplamente difundida. Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique nasceu da vontade de manter esta informação viva e amplamente difundida, e espera contribuir para isso.
 
A vontade de ter acesso a um outro tipo de informação
A informação disponível sobre os ciclones teve por enfoque os danos directamente causados ​​pelos ciclones, e é de facto uma informação extremamente importante para conhecer. No entanto, acho que é também importante saber sobre as experiências pessoais vividas no meio deste desastre. Maningue, Voices of Mozambique nasceu da vontade de saber mais sobre experiencias humanas individuais e sobre a maneira como os ciclones afectaram a vida das pessoas, as actividades do dia-a-dia, os pensamentos e os sentimentos.
 
A consciência da importância de deixar uma memória de dois dos primeiros desastres relacionados com a mudança do clima
""[Beira]  vai ficar na história como tendo sido a primeira cidade a ser devastada completamente pelas Mudanças Climáticas"", Graça Machel, ex-Primeira Dama de Moçambique e da África do Sul
A intensidade dos ciclones e dos seus danos foi inexoravelmente ligada à mudança climática. Para mim, e antes que desastres assim se tornem a norma, é importante fornecer um testemunho de experiências humanas vividas após dois dos primeiros desastres ligado à mudança climática de modo a deixar uma memória das mesmas acessível no futuro.
 
A vontade de dar de volta a um país pelo que ele me trouxe
“Para mim, visitar Moçambique é uma questão de coração”, António Guterres, Secretário-Geral da ONU
Passei cerca de 4 anos a viver e a trabalhar em Moçambique, e devo muito a este país e ao seu povo. Quando os ciclones atingiram o país, eu senti o impacto do choque para o país, para o seu povo, para os meus amigos e os seus familiares no meu coração. Hoje, quero reunir todas as capacidades e interesses que tenho para prestar os meus respeitos e fazer a única coisa que possa fazer: colectar retratos e testemunhos e dar uma voz às pessoas.
 

 
 
O que Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique incluirá?
 
Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique incluirá retratos de uma série de pessoas, os seus testemunhos, as suas fotos, bem como fotos de lugares que foram atingidos pelos ciclones. Incluirá igualmente capítulos breves sobre Moçambique e os próprios ciclones.
 
Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique contará experiências de pessoas, histórias individuais, reacções, eventos do dia-a-dia, pensamentos e sentimentos após os dois desastres.
 
Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique pretende incluir retratos e testemunhos da maior diversidade de pessoas possível, nomeadamente:

de pessoas que foram directamente afectadas pelos ciclones,
de pessoas que foram das primeiras a resgata-las e apoia-las (nacionais e internacionais),
de pessoas que foram afectadas indirectamente,
de pessoas que estão agora a ajudar seis meses depois, etc

 
 
O que significa Maningue?
 
""Maningue"" é uma palavra coloquial originária das línguas nativas faladas principalmente no sul do país. Como advérbio, ""Maningue"" significa ""muito"". Como nome, ""Maningue"" pode também ser usado para confirmar o acordo com o que foi dito precedentemente. Usado como tal, ""Maningue"" pode ser traduzido por ""Sim!!"", ""Pois!!!"".
Uma das frases mais rapidamente ouvida ao visitar Moçambique é: ""Moçambique é maningue nice!""; o que significa: ""Moçambique é muito bom!""
 
 
Como será realizado Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique? - Quatro grandes etapas
 

 
 
O que precisamos?
 
Hoje Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique precisa da sua ajuda para financiar a segunda etapa do projecto: Recolher os testemunhos e retratos.
 
Esta etapa é uma etapa de primeira importância pelo projecto: um período de 6 semanas integras de trabalho em Moçambique para entrevistar pessoas, reunir os seus testemunhos e tirar as suas fotografias e as fotografias dos lugares atingidos pelos ciclones que irão alimentar o livro.
 
Para que servirá o dinheiro?
O valor de 12 000 euros inclui as despesas necessárias para realizar o trabalho a ser feito em Moçambique durante um período de seis semanas integras, bem como as taxas relacionadas com a campanha de crowdfunding.
Uma vez que os ciclones atingiram grandes áreas dentro do país, grandes áreas serão cobertas durante este tempo de trabalho no país. As distâncias e o tipo de estrada a percorrer envolverão voos nacionais, bem como longas viagens de carro 4X4 com um motorista habituado as estradas locais. O tempo passado em cada localidade será fundamental para conquistar a confiança das pessoas e permitir um tempo suficiente para realizar um trabalho de qualidade.

 
Agradecimentos pelo vosso apoio 
 
Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique precisa da vossa ajuda para existir, e pensei numa série de presentes para vos agradecer pelo vosso apoio ao projecto.
Eu pensei muito nos presentes de agradecimento a vos propor. Eu queria que eles respeitem a essência do projecto e que sejam dignos do vosso apoio. Assim sendo, espero que irão gostar deles e apreciá-los ao máximo.
 

 
 
Saibam mais sobre mim
 
O meu nome é Aude Nowak, sou uma cidadã francesa de 33 anos. Eu sou a criadora e gestora do projecto Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique. Eu serei aquela que levará o projecto de A a Z. Eu sou uma pessoa multicultural, com interesses múltiplos e treinada em várias áreas.
Sou formada em economia de desenvolvimento, sociologia e hipnose.
Trabalhei para ONGs, ministérios em países em desenvolvimento, agências de desenvolvimento, as Nações Unidas e o sector privado como consultora internacional e economista de desenvolvimento. Dentro das minhas funções, organizei e levei a cabo missões de trabalho em seis países, entrevistando pessoas e elaborando relatórios oficiais e estudos com base nessas entrevistas.
Eu sempre gostei de tirar fotos e o meu segundo emprego - permanecendo não listado no meu currículo - era como fotógrafa.
Nos últimos anos, desenvolvi as minhas próprias actividades empreendedoras, incluindo escritura, e coaching e acompanhamento com base na hipnose.
Eu falo quatro idiomas (francês, inglês, português e espanhol), e no total, vivi e / ou trabalhei em nove países na minha vida: Moçambique, Laos, Índia, Sri Lanka, Zâmbia, Costa do Marfim, Reino Unido, Suíça e França.
 
 
Riscos e Desafios para a Etapa 2 Maningue, Vozes de Moçambique, e como superá-los
 
Enquanto empreender o trabalho em Moçambique, o projecto de certeza que encontrará desafios. A partir da experiência que tenho organizando missões de trabalho em vários países, e da experiência que tenho de Moçambique, estou confiante que poderei gerir os desafios emergentes e superá-los da melhor forma possível.
Nesta fase, já consegui identificar alguns potenciais desafios e formas de superá-los. Em primeiro lugar, a realização de trabalhos a nível distrital e provincial implica sempre um risco de atrasos e imprevistos. A escolha e a ordem dos locais a visitar, bem como a forma de organizar as entrevistas, serão ambos planejados de maneira a minimizar esses riscos e a facilitar uma maior flexibilidade e adaptabilidade no plano de trabalho caso isso for necessário.
Em segundo lugar, no dia 15 de Outubro de 2019, Moçambique irá realizar eleições gerais para o Presidente, o parlamento nacional, os governadores provinciais e os parlamentos provinciais. A fim de facilitar a organização das entrevistas e participação às mesmas, o trabalho será iniciado nas províncias após a realização das Eleições.
Riscos em termos de segurança existem na parte norte do país. A fim de garantir a segurança do motorista bem como a minha, os locais a serem visitados na parte norte do país serão, portanto, confirmados de acordo com a situação de segurança actualizada no momento da viagem.
 
 
Por favor, espalhem a palavra e contribuam a campanha
 
Se vocês gostem do projecto, por favor, apoiem-o, doando, falando sobre ele ao seu redor, gostando e compartilhando esta página e a página da campanha de angariação de fundos.

Muito Obrigada!

Maningue, Voix du Mozambique
Portraits et témoignages après le passage dévastateur de deux cyclones liés au changement climatique
 
 
Vue d´ensemble
 
En mars et avril 2019, deux cyclones dévastateurs ont frappé le Mozambique l´un après l´autre. Plus de 1,5 million de personnes ont été touchées.
Le projet Maningue, Voix du Mozambique a pour but de transmettre des récits et expériences individuelles vécus à la suite du passage des cyclones dans un livre photographique.
Au travers d´une série de portraits, de témoignages et de photographies, Maningue, Voix du Mozambique vise à donner une voix et une mémoire aux vécus individuels.
 
 
Contexte de Maningue, Voix du Mozambique
 
Dans la nuit du 14 au 15 mars et le 25 avril 2019, deux cyclones liés au changement climatique, Idai et Kenneth, ont frappé le Mozambique, touchant respectivement 1,5 million et 170 000 personnes dans 6 des 10 provinces du pays.
 
Cyclone Idai: ""La pire catastrophe naturelle survenue en Afrique Australe depuis au moins deux décennies"", UNICEF
La ville de Beira, habitée par un demi-million de personnes, et ses environs estimés endommagés ou détruits à 90% par la Fédération internationale de la Croix-Rouge.
Cyclone Kenneth: ""La première fois connue dans l'histoire que deux cyclones tropicaux violents frappent le pays au cours de la même saison"", UNICEF
 
 
Comment est née l'idée de Maningue, Voix du Mozambique?
 
La volonté de maintenir vivante l´information sur les cyclones et leurs conséquences
Lorsque les deux cyclones ont frappé le Mozambique, ils ont été largement couverts par les médias du monde entier. Aujourd'hui, on peut dire qu´il y a de manière générale beaucoup moins d´informations largement diffusées sur ceux-ci. Maningue, Voix du Mozambique est né de la volonté de maintenir l’information sur les cyclones en vie et espère y contribuer.
 
La volonté d'avoir accès à un autre type d'information
Les informations disponibles sur les cyclones ont principalement porté sur les dommages occasionnés, et ce type d´informations est effectivement extrêmement important à diffuser. Néanmoins, je pense qu´il est aussi important d´en savoir plus sur les expériences personnelles vécues au cœur de cette catastrophe. Maningue, Voix du Mozambique est né de la volonté d'en savoir plus sur les expériences humaines individuelles et sur l'impact des cyclones sur la vie, les activités, les pensées et les sentiments des gens.
 
La conscience de l’importance de laisser une mémoire de deux des premières catastrophes liées au changement climatique
 ""[Beira] restera dans l’histoire comme la première ville complètement dévastée par le changement climatique"", Graça Machel, ancienne Première Dame du Mozambique et de l’Afrique du Sud
L’intensité des cyclones et leurs dégâts ont été inexorablement liés au changement climatique. Pour moi, et avant que de telles catastrophes ne deviennent la norme, il est important de témoigner des expériences humaines vécues à la suite de deux des premiers événements dévastateurs liés au changement climatique afin d´en laisser une mémoire accessible dans le futur.
 
La volonté de redonner à un pays pour ce qu'il m'a apporté
“Pour moi, venir au Mozambique est une affaire de cœur”, António Guterres, Secrétaire Général des Nations Unies
J'ai vécu et travaillé pendant environ 4 ans au Mozambique et je dois beaucoup à ce pays et à ses habitants. Lorsque les cyclones ont frappé, j'ai ressenti l'impact du choc pour le pays, pour ses habitants, pour mes amis et pour leurs proches au plus profond de moi. Aujourd’hui, je souhaite rassembler toutes les compétences et tous les intérêts que j’ai pour honorer le pays et faire ce que je suis capable de faire pour lui: recueillir des témoignages et donner une voix aux vécus des gens.

 
 
Qu´est ce que vous pourrez trouver à l´intérieur de Maningue, Voix du Mozambique?
 
Maningue, Voix du Mozambique comprendra des portraits d’un certain nombre de personnes, leurs témoignages, leurs photos, ainsi que des photos de lieux frappés par les cyclones. Il comprendra également de brefs chapitres sur le Mozambique et les cyclones.
Maningue, Voix du Mozambique relatera des expériences personnelles, des vécus individuels, des réactions, des événements de la vie quotidienne, des pensées, et des sentiments vécus à la suite des deux catastrophes.
Le but de Maningue, Voix du Mozambique est d’inclure des portraits et témoignages de la plus grande diversité de personnes possibles, notamment:

des personnes directement touchées par les cyclones,
des premières personnes venues à leur secours (nationaux et internationaux),
des personnes indirectement touchées,
des personnes en train d'aider six mois après, etc.

 
 
Que signifie Maningue?
 
«Maningue» est un mot familier provenant des langues autochtones parlées principalement dans le sud du pays. Utilisé comme adverbe, il signifie «beaucoup» ou «très». Utilisé comme nom, il confirme un accord avec ce qui a été dit précédemment, et peut alors être traduit par ""Ouais carrément !"".
Une des phrases que vous entendrez le plus facilement au Mozambique est: «Mozambique é maningue nice!»; ce qui signifie: ""Le Mozambique est absolument magnifique!"".
 
 
Comment Maningue, Voix du Mozambique va être realisé? - Quatre grandes étapes
 

 
 
De quoi le projet a besoin ?
 
Aujourd'hui, Maningue, Voix du Mozambique a besoin de votre aide pour financer la deuxième étape du projet: la collecte de témoignages et portraits sur place.
Ce sera un moment crucial pour le projet: six semaines complètes de travail dans le pays pour discuter avec les gens sur place, recueillir leurs témoignages et prendre les photos qui alimenteront les portraits et le livre.
 
A quoi servira l'argent?
La somme de 12 000 euros couvre les dépenses nécessaires à l'exécution du travail au Mozambique sur une période de six semaines complètes, ainsi que les frais liés à la campagne de crowdfunding elle-même.
De grandes distances seront traversées étant donné que les cyclones ont frappé de vastes régions du pays. Les distances et type de routes à parcourir impliqueront des vols nationaux ainsi que de longs trajets avec une voiture 4X4 et un chauffeur connaissant les routes locales. Le temps passé dans chaque lieu sera déterminant pour gagner la confiance des gens et avoir un temps suffisant pour effectuer un travail de qualité.

 
 
 Remerciements pour votre soutien !

 
Maningue, Voix du Mozambique a besoin de votre aide pour exister et j'ai pensé à une série de cadeaux pour vous remercier de votre soutien au projet.
J'ai beaucoup pensé au choix des cadeaux à vous proposer pour vous remercier afin qu’ils respectent l´essence du projet et qu´ils soient dignes de votre soutien. J'espère qu’ils vous plairont et que vous en profiterez au maximum.
 

 
 
En savoir plus sur moi
 
Je m'appelle Aude Nowak, je suis de nationalité française et j´ai 33 ans. Je suis la créatrice et gestionnaire du projet Maningue, Voix du Mozambique. Je serai celle qui mènera le projet de A à Z. Je suis une personne multiculturelle, je m´intéresse à beaucoup de choses différentes et ai étudié et travaillé dans divers domaines.
Je suis formée en économie du développement, en sociologie et en hypnose.
J'ai travaillé pour des ONGs, des ministères dans des pays en développement, des agences de développement, les Nations Unies et le secteur privé en tant que consultante internationale et économiste du développement. Dans le cadre de mes fonctions, j'ai organisé et géré de nombreuses missions de travail dans différents pays, réalisé de nombreux entretiens auprès de personnes sur place, et rédigé des rapports et études officiels à partir de l´analyse de ces entretiens.
J'ai toujours aimé prendre des photos et mon deuxième travail – qui reste jusqu´à aujourd´hui non précisé sur mon CV – était photographe. Ces dernières années, j'ai développé mes propres activités entrepreneuriales, notamment l'écriture, et le coaching et l´accompagnement grâce à l'hypnose.
Je parle quatre langues (français, anglais, portugais et espagnol), et au total, j'ai vécu et / ou travaillé dans neuf pays dans ma vie: au Mozambique, au Laos, en Inde, au Sri Lanka, Zambie, en Côte d'Ivoire, au Royaume-Uni, en Suisse et en France.
 
 
Risques et défis de l´ Étape 2 de Maningue, Voix du Mozambique, et comment les surmonter
 
Au cours du travail sur place, le projet rencontrera très probablement plusieurs défis. De par mon expérience d´organisations de missions de travail dans divers pays et mon expérience au Mozambique, j’ai toute confiance que je pourrais identifier et gérer au mieux les défis qui pourraient voir le jour afin de réaliser le travail de la meilleure manière possible.
A ce stade, j'ai déjà pu identifier certains défis potentiels et des moyens de les surmonter. Tout d’abord, travailler au niveau des districts et des provinces comporte toujours des risques de retards et d’imprévus. Le choix et l'ordre des lieux à visiter, ainsi que la manière d'organiser les entretiens, seront planifiés de manière à minimiser ces risques et à permettre d´être flexible et de pouvoir adapter le plan de travail si nécessaire.
Ensuite, le 15 octobre 2019, le Mozambique organisera des élections générales pour le Président, le parlement national, les gouverneurs de province et les parlements de province. Afin de faciliter l'organisation des entretiens et de maximiser la participation des gens sur place, le travail dans les provinces sera commencé après la tenue des élections.
Enfin, dans le nord du pays, il existe des risques sécuritaires. Afin de garantir la sécurité du chauffeur et la mienne, le choix final des lieux à visiter dans le nord sera donc fait en fonction de la situation sécuritaire actualisée au moment du voyage.

<p>In 2018, we went even bigger, and moved the Queen City AniFest to the Conexus Art Centre. It was a fantastic choice: the location offered us more space, better amenities, more staff, and we developed a solid relationship with the CAC staff.</p>

<h2>Hello you! </h2>
<p>Hello possible backer! You are awesome for checking this out! Let me quickly introduce myself; I am Lorence Cramwinckel, chair of this year's MSc Business Information Management (BIM) study trip committee. Together with Rick van 't Hof, Mateusz Bochenczak and Gabriel Müller Adade we are organizing this year's MSc BIM study trip to San Francisco and Silicon Valley! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A little bit about the committe:</strong> We are all MSc BIM students ourselves at the Rotterdam School of Management, which is part of the Erasmus University. In the beginning of the academic year we were selected and asked to fulfill the challenging task of organizing a mind blowing trip to Silicon Valley with 28 students. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490805656/wglbalv4rwi1ucconmn7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>That's us, from left to right we have: Gabriel, Lorence, Rick and Mateusz</p>
<p><strong>A little bit about the MSc BIM study trip:</strong> The 19th of June we will fly to San Francisco to stay in the area for about 2 weeks and then we wil fly back to The Netherlands on the 4th of July again. During our time abroad we will visit numerous companies (from big corporates to small companies) to show our participants how they work, what they do and what they stand for. This is super valuable to students since they get a real understanding of different company cultures and are therefore more likely to make the right decisions when it comes to finding a job. Furthermore, this trip also includes a lot of bonding through group activities and it can also serve as great cultural introduction for those who have never been in the San Francisco bay area! </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Campaign</h3>
<p>As you've read, we are organizing the MSc BIM study trip to Silicon Valley for 28 students, which will take place this summer. Due to some unforeseen circumstances the flight ticket prices to San Francisco have increased tremendously compared to previous years and funding has been cut by our study association. This resulted in more expenses than we can cover and to solve this we have been raising money like crazy! However, it is still not enough unfortunately and that is where you come in: You can help us close that scary gap in our budget! To the right you can find some awesome perks that might incentivize you to support us. We will continue our wild acquisition and in the end, we can make this happen together! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We. Need. Money. Simple as that! But what do you get? We thought of some very special perks for you and here's what we can offer you! </p>
<ul>
<li>Micro Sponsor Deal: you basically support us for only €5 (every penny counts!), in return we will always be grateful, and the universe will grant you some good karma! </li>
<li>Postcard from San Francisco: That says it all, you receive a signed postcard from the committee!</li>
<li>Official Aftermovie Download in HD: One of our participants is well-known for his recording and editing skills and he won't dissapoint you!</li>
<li>A3 sized Poster with group photo: An A3 sized poster of an amazing group photo will be send to your home.</li>
<li>Special Closing Credits: In addition to receiving the aftermovie download your name/short message shall appear in the closing credits!</li>
<li>Souvenirs from San Francisco: Yes baby, you can get a super cool fridge magnet and a keychain delivered to your home!</li>
<li>Super Sponsor package: ALL IN! You receive a postcard, the official aftermovie HD download AND souvenirs from San Francisco! Get in while you can. </li>
<li>Logo on Official Sweater: This is a sweet deal if you own a company that is looking to get in contact with MSc BIM students, or that wants exposure in America! This sweater will be worn and absolutely loved by our participants and your logo can be printed on it! </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We want to raise a minimum of €500. This together with our own acquisition should be enough to provide the participants with a carefree trip. This money will help to cover some of the costs in the US (accommodation is our main constraint). If however, we fail to reach this goal there is a chance our participants have to pay more than they are already paying for the trip. So every penny helps!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As graduate master students a scary part of our lives will begin in a very short period of time: we will have to start our professional careers. Some students (like myself) have no clue yet about where they want to work or what they want to specifically. Our trip helps to form understanding of the company culture, especially in the tech area, and it provides profound insights to what these companies actually do.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you really can't contribute any monetary means not to worry! You can still help us by sharing this campaign with your family and friends who might be interested as well! Make some noice for us on social media or on your school/university. Every action counts, just remember that when you drop even the smallest pebble in a pond, it will create a thousand ripples</p>
<p>Thank you for reading this and thank you once again for making a difference!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello from the Litchfield County Zine Fest organizer team! I'm Olivia M., and I'm the one who came up with the idea for the fest. I've been involved in zine culture since Fall of 2014, and since I discovered zines I've made over 25 zines of my own, traded hundreds of zines with other zine-makers, tabled at several zine fests and other art events, run several zine workshops teaching about zines and how to make them, and almost completed work on a zine-trading social network Android app called Let's Trade Zines, to be launched in the near future. Basically, my life revolves around zines!</p>
<p>Sometime around March of this year, I had the idea to organize a zine fest in my neck of the woods; Northwest Connecticut. I ran a survey looking for people who might be interested in tabling at such an event, and got over 30 responses from people in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island,  Pennsylvania, and even Ohio! </p>
<p>I am passionate about spreading zine culture in my area, as it has incredible potential for inspiring creativity in people of all ages, facilitating new friendships, promoting the arts, and giving voice to unheard artists, particularly those from traditionally marginalized groups.</p>
<p>I've done my research, and I believe I can get the Kent Community House in Kent, CT for the Litchfield County Zine Fest. This venue comes with tables and chairs, enough for about 50 people to table at the fest. The space is accessible and has a gender-neutral bathroom, as well as a coatroom that would work as a quiet space. Given that I have experience with disability myself, I am determined to make this event as accessible as possible. Here is a video exploring the space: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYUrIgQcPuE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYUrIgQcPuE</a></p>
<p>We applied for an arts grant to cover 3/4 of the costs of this event, but arts grants are on hold in CT because the state hasn't decided on a budget yet. There would have been an Indiegogo campaign either way, but it seems that the arts grant may not work out in time for the event. In the event that we get the arts grant in time for the event, the extra money will be spent on reach goals and paying organizers for their time and work.</p>
<p>I'm going to go ahead with plans for the zine fest no matter what, but your donation can help more artists be able to afford to come out and table (if we reach our goal, we won't have to charge tabling fees), help us to advertise the event so more local people know it's happening, and allow us more wiggle room for decorations, workshops, handouts, and freebies.</p>
<p>The zine fest will likely be held in October or early November, but there is no set date as of the start of this campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is $1700, but we can run on less by charging tabling fees to vendors. We also have a few reach goals as well if we manage to raise more money than the base goal. Here's a breakdown of how we'll use the money:</p>
<ul>
<li>Venue rental: $525 (rents Kent Community House for 7 hours, including set-up and clean-up; price includes tables and chairs)</li>
<li>Security deposit: $250 (will be returned if there is no damage to the property, in which case it will be used to pay organizers for their work)</li>
<li>Event insurance: $200</li>
<li>Newspaper ads and posters: $575</li>
<li>Other materials: $150 (this includes workshop materials, decorations, handouts, and other miscellaneous expenses)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a breakdown of how we'll spend the advertising money:</p>
<table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0""><tbody>
<tr>
<td style=""width:319px;""><p>Banner</p></td>
<td style=""width:319px;""><p>$20</p></td>

</tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>This adds up to $554, which we've rounded up to $575 to allow for any fluctuations in price. We would have added $50 for posters, but one of our organizers' contacts has agreed to donate them.</p>
<p>Reach Goals:</p>
<ul><li>We don't have exact dollar amounts for these, but any extra money will go towards gas for driving some artists to and from the train station, potentially paying for non-organizers to give workshops, or to print free zines for attendants of the main Zines 101 workshop (run by me, Olivia M.)</li></ul>
<p>Now, here's what you can get by donating!:</p>
<ul>
<li>A donation of any dollar amount will get your name printed on the zine fest banner which will be hung outside the venue on the day of the event.</li>
<li>A $5 donation will get you a handmade Litchfield County Zine Fest pinback button</li>
<li>A $10 donation will get you a printed copy of a zine I made on zines and how to make them (48 pages long, 1/4 size). (This zine is available as a free download here for those who want to read it, but can't afford to donate $10: <a href=""http://oliviaszines.tumblr.com/post/163371392859/free-zines-101-zine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://oliviaszines.tumblr.com/post/163371392859/free-zines-101-zine</a>)</li>
<li>A $15 donation with get you a button and the zine from the $10 tier</li>
<li>A $50 donation will get you a mystery pack of zines from the zine fest organizers, as well as the items from the previous tiers</li>
<li>A $100 donation will guarantee you a full table spot at the zine fest</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We've never run a zine fest before, so there is some risk in this project, but we believe we can do it! Having experience attending and tabling at other zine fests, as well as running workshops, we believe we are capable of running this event.</p>
<p>Potential challenges would include not getting the Kent Community House for the zine fest, in which case we have a back-up venue, as well as ensuring that enough people show up to the event. This challenge is perhaps the scariest, but we believe a combination of advertising through newspapers, local posters, Facebook, email, and other social media will solve this potential problem.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to contribute, spread the word about this campaign! If you live within driving distance of the fest, you could volunteer to either help with set-up, clean-up, greeting visitors, or driving artists to and from the train station (about ten miles each way). Email me at metaparadox11 AT gmail DOT com if you're interested in volunteering!</p>

Security deposit: $250 (will be returned if there is no damage to the property, in which case it will be used to pay organizers for their work)
Event insurance: $200
Newspaper ads and posters: $575
Other materials: $150 (this includes workshop materials, decorations, handouts, and other miscellaneous expenses)

Here's a breakdown of how we'll spend the advertising money:


Banner
$20


4 Week Ad in “Compass” Section of The Millerton News, The Lakeville Journal, and The Winsted Journal – 2 columns by 2”
$156


Two Week Ad in Shoppers Guide – 2 columns by 2”
$72


1 Day Ad (Thursday Before Event) in “Weekend” Section of the Republican-American – 1 column by 2.5”
$111


1 Day Ad (Sunday Before Event) Register Citizen – 1 column by 3”
$62


1 Day Ad (Sunday Before Event) in the Berkshire Eagle – 2 columns by 2”
$73


2 Week Ad in the Foothills Trader (price yet to be confirmed with advertising dept.)
$60


This adds up to $554, which we've rounded up to $575 to allow for any fluctuations in price. We would have added $50 for posters, but one of our organizers' contacts has agreed to donate them.
Reach Goals:
We don't have exact dollar amounts for these, but any extra money will go towards gas for driving some artists to and from the train station, potentially paying for non-organizers to give workshops, or to print free zines for attendants of the main Zines 101 workshop (run by me, Olivia M.)
Now, here's what you can get by donating!:

A donation of any dollar amount will get your name printed on the zine fest banner which will be hung outside the venue on the day of the event.
A $5 donation will get you a handmade Litchfield County Zine Fest pinback button
A $10 donation will get you a printed copy of a zine I made on zines and how to make them (48 pages long, 1/4 size). (This zine is available as a free download here for those who want to read it, but can't afford to donate $10: http://oliviaszines.tumblr.com/post/163371392859/free-zines-101-zine)
A $15 donation with get you a button and the zine from the $10 tier
A $50 donation will get you a mystery pack of zines from the zine fest organizers, as well as the items from the previous tiers
A $100 donation will guarantee you a full table spot at the zine fest


Risks & Challenges
We've never run a zine fest before, so there is some risk in this project, but we believe we can do it! Having experience attending and tabling at other zine fests, as well as running workshops, we believe we are capable of running this event.
Potential challenges would include not getting the Kent Community House for the zine fest, in which case we have a back-up venue, as well as ensuring that enough people show up to the event. This challenge is perhaps the scariest, but we believe a combination of advertising through newspapers, local posters, Facebook, email, and other social media will solve this potential problem.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't afford to contribute, spread the word about this campaign! If you live within driving distance of the fest, you could volunteer to either help with set-up, clean-up, greeting visitors, or driving artists to and from the train station (about ten miles each way). Email me at metaparadox11 AT gmail DOT com if you're interested in volunteering!

<h2>Fashion For Everyone</h2>
<p>We believe fashion is inclusive. We have style for miles and love to create for all people. </p>
<p>Jessica is the clothing designer of 808GyptsyLove. Jessica is the visionary of this entire collection.</p>
<p>Kenyetta is an all around designer for Creo by Keca. Kenyetta also designs our bags. </p>
<p>Megan, also known as All Around Artist, screen prints fabric and garments. She also makes jewelry as All Around Style. </p>
<p>The opportunity to showcase 808GyptsyLove's Spring/Summer 2018 Collection in New York is a testament to our collaborative abilities and will bring us, as well as our community, much needed recognition. </p>
<p>When you support this campaign you are contributing to changing the fashion industry and beauty standards for good. Jessica, Kenyetta and Megan's mission is to create an inclusive culture that supports all shapes, sizes, identities, etc.</p>
<p>Our passion for creativity, design, expression and fashion is infectious. It is also much needed. We are building a unique community in the midwest encouraging people to be unapologetically themselves and up lifting artists.</p>
<h2>We Need Your Help</h2>
<p>We are humble artists. Will you help us get there?</p>
<p>We are traveling to New York and bringing our team with us. That means models, photographers, model coach, and of coarse the designers. We are raising a minimum of $2000 to accommodate our team. That means travel, lodging, and food. </p>
<p>This opportunity will raise our entire community to another level. The exposure and experience of New York Fashion Week will grant us access to much needed networking and new opportunities. </p>
<p>This is not just about 808GyptsyLove. We are tired of seeing one standard of beauty represented in mainstream media, the fashion industry, and our culture. Aren't you? We stand with body positivity, free the nipple, Fashion Revolution, and our pieces encourage self esteem, self confidence and self love. We want to change the world for the better.</p>
<h2>About The Collection</h2>
<p>Our collection has original screen printed fabrics by Megan LaCroix, All Around Style. The design on the print is called Death By Obsession. This design is a representation of how hard every single person works to achieve their goals and passions. We are literally killing ourselves for what we need. This print incorporated into Spring/Summer clothing is a metaphor of rebirth and resilience required to pick yourself back up after being knocked down or when a piece of us dies. The seasons we experience in the midwest are a constant reminder of our mortality and the ephemeral. We are required to sacrifice pieces of ourselves to progress. Death is part of nature, even though it is challenging as emotional beings to accept. The pain makes us grow and this is where the garments come into play. </p>

</div></div>","Fashion For Everyone
We believe fashion is inclusive. We have style for miles and love to create for all people. 
Jessica is the clothing designer of 808GyptsyLove. Jessica is the visionary of this entire collection.
Kenyetta is an all around designer for Creo by Keca. Kenyetta also designs our bags. 
Megan, also known as All Around Artist, screen prints fabric and garments. She also makes jewelry as All Around Style. 
The opportunity to showcase 808GyptsyLove's Spring/Summer 2018 Collection in New York is a testament to our collaborative abilities and will bring us, as well as our community, much needed recognition. 
When you support this campaign you are contributing to changing the fashion industry and beauty standards for good. Jessica, Kenyetta and Megan's mission is to create an inclusive culture that supports all shapes, sizes, identities, etc.
Our passion for creativity, design, expression and fashion is infectious. It is also much needed. We are building a unique community in the midwest encouraging people to be unapologetically themselves and up lifting artists.
We Need Your Help
We are humble artists. Will you help us get there?
We are traveling to New York and bringing our team with us. That means models, photographers, model coach, and of coarse the designers. We are raising a minimum of $2000 to accommodate our team. That means travel, lodging, and food. 
This opportunity will raise our entire community to another level. The exposure and experience of New York Fashion Week will grant us access to much needed networking and new opportunities. 
This is not just about 808GyptsyLove. We are tired of seeing one standard of beauty represented in mainstream media, the fashion industry, and our culture. Aren't you? We stand with body positivity, free the nipple, Fashion Revolution, and our pieces encourage self esteem, self confidence and self love. We want to change the world for the better.
About The Collection
Our collection has original screen printed fabrics by Megan LaCroix, All Around Style. The design on the print is called Death By Obsession. This design is a representation of how hard every single person works to achieve their goals and passions. We are literally killing ourselves for what we need. This print incorporated into Spring/Summer clothing is a metaphor of rebirth and resilience required to pick yourself back up after being knocked down or when a piece of us dies. The seasons we experience in the midwest are a constant reminder of our mortality and the ephemeral. We are required to sacrifice pieces of ourselves to progress. Death is part of nature, even though it is challenging as emotional beings to accept. The pain makes us grow and this is where the garments come into play. 
We are building from the ground up. The fabrics are mostly donated to us. In combination with the print these garments are, in a sense, created out of the death we experience. By creating something new from something old or dead, we are honoring the past, growing from the pain of living, and creating new life from these experiences. These pieces are the new growth out of the hibernation of winter. When spring rolls around, the neutral, dead environment soon sprouts with greens that turn to flowers. A reminder that there is life in death, strength in pain, change in discomfort, etc. This also plays into our persistence on changing the fashion industry and beauty standards.

Hoy en día, los usos más comunes que se dan a la ixtle son la fabricación de cuerda, bolsas, zapatos, así como accesorios de baño y limpieza en general. Entre 1941 y 1991, la industria del ixtle en México fue organizada a través de la creación de 745 cooperativas y un gobierno único que poseía las plantas de procesamiento. En la década de los ochenta, después del aumento de la inversión para la industrialización, la producción de ixtle se distribuyó en pocas plantas hasta que la demanda comenzó a disminuir considerablemente con la llegada de materiales alternativos como el plástico, que comenzaron a obstaculizar los esfuerzos de los artesanos por posicionar sus productos en el mercado. Viendo que no podían competir con los nuevos costos de producción, los nuevos productores se vieron obligados a cesar esta actividad manual, hasta que un grupo de habitantes de El Decá decidió hace unos años volver a iniciar el proceso, al darse cuenta de que aún había demanda de estos productos.</p><p style=""text-align: right;""><i>Ixtle is a natural fiber that has been used by indigenous communities for centuries.

Between 1941 and 1991, the ixtle industry in Mexico was organized through the creation of 745 cooperatives and a single government owned processing and selling plants. But in the 80´s decade, after the increase of investment for industrialization, the ixtle production was distributed in only few plants until the demand for it started to decrease considerably when alternative materials, such as plastic, began to hinder the craftsmen´s efforts to position their products on the market. Seeing that they couldn´t compete with the new production costs, ixtle producers were forced to cease this manual activity,  until a group of inhabitants from El Decá decided few years ago to start the process again when they realized that there was still demand for these products.</i></p><p style=""text-align: right;""> </p><p>Este proyecto tendrá un impacto positivo directo en las condiciones de vida de los pueblos indígenas de estas comunidades marginadas, ya que podrán transmitir sus conocimientos y tradiciones a todos los miembros del municipio interesados ​​en aprender el arte de trabajar el ixtle.

Una familia de artesanos buscaba nuevas alternativas para producir y vender sus artesanías, ya que no tienen la infraestructura ni los medios financieros para aumentar su producción y transmitir sus conocimientos a otros habitantes.En 2015, el grupo de artesanos de El Decá empezó a reunirse con grupos de otras comunidades para reforzar las habilidades de organización. Desde entonces, las comunidades de El Decá, El Bingú y La Vega trabajan juntas para lograr estos objetivos. Como parte de la labor integral, hemos estado trabajando con ellos impartiendo talleres de comercio justo, cadena de valor y economía solidaria.Our first encounter with ixtle craftmen in El Decá took place almost four years ago while working in another community nearby. A family of craftsmen was looking for new alternatives to produce and sell their handicrafts since they don't have the infrastructure nor the financial means to increase their production and pass their knowledge on to other inhabitants.In 2015, the group of artisans of el Decá started meeting with groups of other communities to enforce the organizational skills. Since then, El Decá, El Bingú and La Vega communities are working together to achieve these goals. As a part of the comprehensive work, we’ve been working with them, giving workshops of fair trade, value chain, solidary economy.Reunión de talleres de las 3 comunidades / Workshops Meeting of producers of the three communities Dado que los habitantes de estas comunidades dependen de la venta de productos de ixtle para su sustento, la necesidad de un centro de producción y capacitación se ha convertido en una prioridad. Su construcción promueve el rescate del conocimiento de las técnicas tradicionales de construcción y el uso de materiales locales para reducir el costo y el impacto ambiental. El diseño arquitectónico del centro toma en cuenta los usos culturales de los espacios rurales, cada habitación está diseñada de acuerdo con los hábitos de los productores y las necesidades para la producción adecuada de los objetos de ixtle.Since the inhabitants of these communities rely on the sale of ixtle products for their livelihood, the need for a production and capacity training center has become a priority. The construction promotes the knowledge rescue of traditional construction techniques and through the use of local materials so as to reduce the cost and environmental impact of the construction. The architectural design of the center takes into account the cultural uses of rural spaces, as every room of the center is designed according to the producers' habits and needs for the appropriate production of the ixtle objects. A finales de 2016 obtuvimos una subvención para construir el Centro de Capacitación y Producción de Ixtle para las comunidades y comenzamos la construcción en diciembre de ese mismo año. Estimamos un presupuesto, pero desafortunadamente, durante el proceso de construcción, la economía nacional sufrió una crisis generando el aumento de los precios de los materiales de construcción. Es por eso que necesitamos más fondos, para no tener que detener la construcción sin terminarla.By the end of 2016, we earned a grant to build the Ixtle Production and Training Center for the communities. And we started the construction since December of 2016. We estimated a budget, but unfortunately, during the building process, national economy suffered a crisis generating the increase of the prices of building materials. That’s why, we need more funds, lest have to stop the construction without finishing it.Iniciando la construcción del Centro de Capacitaciòn y Producción de Ixtle / Beginning the construction of the Ixtle Production Center ¿Por qué es tan importante este proyecto para la comunidad? / Why is this project important to the community?El ixtle es una fibra natural que ha sido utilizada por las comunidades indígenas durante siglos. Hoy en día, los usos más comunes que se dan a la ixtle son la fabricación de cuerda, bolsas, zapatos, así como accesorios de baño y limpieza en general. Entre 1941 y 1991, la industria del ixtle en México fue organizada a través de la creación de 745 cooperativas y un gobierno único que poseía las plantas de procesamiento. En la década de los ochenta, después del aumento de la inversión para la industrialización, la producción de ixtle se distribuyó en pocas plantas hasta que la demanda comenzó a disminuir considerablemente con la llegada de materiales alternativos como el plástico, que comenzaron a obstaculizar los esfuerzos de los artesanos por posicionar sus productos en el mercado. Viendo que no podían competir con los nuevos costos de producción, los nuevos productores se vieron obligados a cesar esta actividad manual, hasta que un grupo de habitantes de El Decá decidió hace unos años volver a iniciar el proceso, al darse cuenta de que aún había demanda de estos productos.Ixtle is a natural fiber that has been used by indigenous communities for centuries. Nowadays, the most common uses given to the ixtle are for manufacturing rope, bags, shoes, as well as cleaning, scrubbing and bathing accessories. Between 1941 and 1991, the ixtle industry in Mexico was organized through the creation of 745 cooperatives and a single government owned processing and selling plants. But in the 80´s decade, after the increase of investment for industrialization, the ixtle production was distributed in only few plants until the demand for it started to decrease considerably when alternative materials, such as plastic, began to hinder the craftsmen´s efforts to position their products on the market. Seeing that they couldn´t compete with the new production costs, ixtle producers were forced to cease this manual activity,  until a group of inhabitants from El Decá decided few years ago to start the process again when they realized that there was still demand for these products. Este proyecto tendrá un impacto positivo directo en las condiciones de vida de los pueblos indígenas de estas comunidades marginadas, ya que podrán transmitir sus conocimientos y tradiciones a todos los miembros del municipio interesados ​​en aprender el arte de trabajar el ixtle. El nuevo centro también permitirá a los artesanos maximizar su producción ya que reducirá las cansadas horas de trabajo diario gracias a la disponibilidad de más espacio y materiales. Los objetos se venden actualmente en un mercado cercano a la comunidad y en un mercado de agricultores en la Ciudad de México, pero los artesanos desean alcanzar un mercado más grande para que su esfuerzo general sea recompensado de manera justa.Obtendrán herramientas para fijar precios justos y eliminar intermediarios. Acrecentar la venta directa favorecerá sus ingresos y estimulará el ahorro. Todo esto les permitirá obtener recursos para invertir en los consumibles y bienes de capital que necesitan para impulsar la venta de sus productos.This project will have a direct positive impact on the living conditions of the indigenous people from these marginalized communities as they will be able to pass their knowledge and tradition on to every member of the municipality interested in learning the art of making ixtle objects. The new center will also allow the craftsmen to maximize their production as they will reduce the tiresome hours of daily work thanks to the availability of more and adequate space and materials. The objects are currently sold in a local market in a Municipality near the community and in a farmer’s market in Mexico City, but the craftsmen wish to reach a bigger market so that their overall effort be rewarded fairly.They will get tools to set fair prices and to eliminate brokers. So, they could enhance direct sell, which, in turn, will be favored by the income raising and saving stimulation.  All these will allow them to get resources to invest on the consumables and capital assets that they need to boost the sell of their products.   También estamos trabajando en la promoción activa de la sensibilización de los consumidores y la sociedad civil sobre el proceso productivo y su valor social, cultural y económico. Fomentamos el consumo responsable, posicionando estos productos en el esquema de comercio justo para generar mayores ganancias para los productores y mejorar su nivel de vida.We are also working in the active promotion of awareness of consumers and civil society about the productive process and it’s social, cultural and economic value. Encouraging responsible consumption, positioning these products in the fair trade scheme to generate higher profits for producers and improving their living standards. Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes /  What We Need & What You GetNecesitamos al menos $ 5,100 dólares para terminar la construcción del centro de producción con materiales locales como hojas de maguey, piedra y quiotes (tallos de la flor del maguey).* Construcción de todo el centro (164 m²) con materiales locales: $ 21,270 USDWe need at least $5,100 to finish the construction of the production center with local materials such as maguey leaves, stone and quiotes (stems of the maguey flower).  * Construction of the entire center (164 m²) with local materials: $ 21,270Esto incluye la mano de obra, la compra de materiales como concreto, madera, baldosas de arcilla y piedra si no hay suficientes en el sitio. El resto del material será utilizado directamente por la comunidad.Los habitantes de las comunidades rurales de México dependen en gran medida de los recursos naturales para vivir y producir. Las plantas de maguey por lo general tardan entre 8 y 10 años para crecer plenamente en esta región semi-desértica, por lo que es necesario evaluar y promover el uso racional de la tierra y el maguey como una estrategia ambiental local. Alrededor de 50 habitantes asistirán al taller de planificación ecológica del uso de la tierra. A medida que sus conocimientos teóricos se fortalezcan, también lo hará su capacidad de gestionar su territorio inmediato una vez que el proyecto esté concluido.This include the labour, the purchase of materials such as concrete, wood, clay tiles and stone if  there isn´t enough on site. The rest of the material will be directly used from the community. Inhabitants of rural communities in Mexico heavily rely on natural resources to live and produce. The maguey plants usually take 8 to 10 years to grow fully in this semi–desert region, therefore it is necessary to assess and promote the rational use of land space and maguey plants as a local environmental strategy. Around 50 inhabitants will attend the ecological land use planning workshop. As their theoretical knowledge will be strenghtened, so will be their ability to manage their immediate territory once the project is concluded. Nuestras recompensas / Our perksCada producto de ixtle que usted recibirá será hecho cuidadosamente a mano por los productores de esta comunidad.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Intercollegiate Psychedelics Network is organizing the second-ever Intercollegiate Psychedelics Summit (IPS) from April 17-20th at Harvard University. Across the country, IPN members are founding and growing clubs that seek to responsibly introduce psychedelics back into academia, the clinic, and society at large with measured optimism. IPN is uniting a diverse array of stakeholders, including activists, scientists, and artists, to discuss the renaissance of psychedelic research and awareness and to envision a more equitable and compassionate society. Pioneers of this movement will be present, such as Rick Doblin, Founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). Attendees will come from the Boston area as well as across the country. </p>
<p>The theme of IPS 2020 is ""The Convergence: Co-creating the Future.” As psychedelics become decriminalized and integrated into our healthcare system and broader society, our goal is to envision how the landscape of psychedelics and consciousness research will change in the coming decades. We hope to inspire college students across America who want to make a lasting impact on humanity by properly harnessing the potential of psychedelics. <br/>Emerging research illustrates psychedelics’ ability to alleviate suffering, including treatments for depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, eating disorders, and OCD.</p>

<h3>What We're Funding</h3>
<p>This summit is completely student-organized, and we rely on donors and grants to make it happen! </p>
<p>While any funds we raise are greatly appreciated, <strong>our goal is $20,000. </strong></p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of our expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Marketing materials </p></li>
<li><p>Event materials (posters, graphics, etc) </p></li>
<li><p>Food and beverages </p></li>
<li><p>Speaker travel and accommodation </p></li>
<li><p>Scholarships for students’ transportation</p></li>
<li><p>Subsidizing tickets</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We hope to <strong>l</strong><strong>ower ticket costs as much as possible</strong> and <strong>provide scholarships to students who cannot afford transportation</strong>, but we will prioritize covering the costs that are essential to the event operations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The so-called <strong>‘Psychedelic Renaissance’</strong> has ushered in a new era of psychedelic research that has the potential to<strong> literally save lives</strong>. However, in order to reintroduce, <strong>we must have measured discourse </strong>and integration for all parts of the psychedelic community. Our impact is to create a space for this discourse and allow the fertilization of ideas and community. We are grass-roots and student-run. <strong>We need your help to create impact.</strong></p>
<p>Our first conference was an inspiring and illuminating experience, and we want IPS 2020 to reach new heights. We have put together a rockstar speaker lineup, incredible workshops across a variety of topics, and a mix of experiences like live art and music. We hope to bring together <strong>even more people this year in spirit of co-creating our future. </strong></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Intercollegiate Psychedelics Network is organizing the second-ever Intercollegiate Psychedelics Summit (IPS) from April 17-20th at Harvard University. Across the country, IPN members are founding and growing clubs that seek to responsibly introduce psychedelics back into academia, the clinic, and society at large with measured optimism. IPN is uniting a diverse array of stakeholders, including activists, scientists, and artists, to discuss the renaissance of psychedelic research and awareness and to envision a more equitable and compassionate society. Pioneers of this movement will be present, such as Rick Doblin, Founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). Attendees will come from the Boston area as well as across the country. 
The theme of IPS 2020 is ""The Convergence: Co-creating the Future.” As psychedelics become decriminalized and integrated into our healthcare system and broader society, our goal is to envision how the landscape of psychedelics and consciousness research will change in the coming decades. We hope to inspire college students across America who want to make a lasting impact on humanity by properly harnessing the potential of psychedelics. Emerging research illustrates psychedelics’ ability to alleviate suffering, including treatments for depression, anxiety, addiction, PTSD, eating disorders, and OCD.
You can purchase tickets here.

What We're Funding
This summit is completely student-organized, and we rely on donors and grants to make it happen! 
While any funds we raise are greatly appreciated, our goal is $20,000. 
Here is a breakdown of our expenses:

Marketing materials 
Event materials (posters, graphics, etc) 
Food and beverages 
Speaker travel and accommodation 
Scholarships for students’ transportation
Subsidizing tickets

 
We hope to lower ticket costs as much as possible and provide scholarships to students who cannot afford transportation, but we will prioritize covering the costs that are essential to the event operations.

The Impact
The so-called ‘Psychedelic Renaissance’ has ushered in a new era of psychedelic research that has the potential to literally save lives. However, in order to reintroduce, we must have measured discourse and integration for all parts of the psychedelic community. Our impact is to create a space for this discourse and allow the fertilization of ideas and community. We are grass-roots and student-run. We need your help to create impact.
Our first conference was an inspiring and illuminating experience, and we want IPS 2020 to reach new heights. We have put together a rockstar speaker lineup, incredible workshops across a variety of topics, and a mix of experiences like live art and music. We hope to bring together even more people this year in spirit of co-creating our future.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi my name is Michael Hughes and I work with <a href=""http://www.nwrafting.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Northwest Rafting Company</a>. Every November we adventure halfway around the world to share and explore the small mountain kingdom of Bhutan. While there we embrace the culture, explore famous Dzongs, monasteries, and watched as western culture blends with the long standing traditions of Bhutan. A handful of our guides have gotten to know the guides and formed long term friendships. We would love to return the hospitality and share our culture and rivers with them. </p>
<p>The whitewater industry in Bhutan is fairly small and new, but growing rapidly as tourists come to visit and want some excitement in their trip. Getting a crew of Bhutanese guides here would help expose them to new whitewater and give them the opportunity to expand their knowledge of what it is to be a professional river guide.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need $8,000 to get these boys from Bhutan to the U.S.A. </p>
<p>A huge portion of that money will be used in airfare and visas from Bhutan's capital city of Thumphu, to Portland Oregon. </p>
<p>Funds will also be used to help pay for food, lodging, and fuel to keep the adventure mobile going.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>There are a handful of excellent perks from a simple handwritten thank you to your own traditional Buddhist Thangka painting.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Not everyone can afford, the time or money, to adventure around to world for new experiences. Helping this crew of young professions will help build and change their view of what it means to be a professional river guide. They will get the opportunity to travel outside of Asia and see what else the world has to offer. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is probably the biggest project I have even taken on. I have never tried to raise thousands of dollars, and there is so much that needs to get done.</p>
<p>There are visa forms to be filled out and obtains, flights to figure out, and of course the adventure route. Lots of paperwork and hoops to jump through.</p>
<p>With a strong backing of friends, family, and outfitters I think we can raise the funds to help share a small slice of the American Whitewater community with our Bhutanese friends. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It would be excellent if you could help spread the word about our project on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and any other social media you use. It would also be great if you could share with your friends and family that aren't connected via social media. Any and every little bit helps! Thanks!</p>

<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
<p>We are an association that deals with the study of history and its revival. We have been active for 15 years throughout Croatia and Central Europe. The knowledge we gain from historians and researches is turning to reality. So today we have skilled people who know how to handle the weapons that was used 500 years ago. </p>
<p>The Association annually organizes a large medieval festival last weekend in July. The event has been organized for 9 consecutive years. The attendance of our event is about 10,000 people but only about 2000 people can watch our battle on fortress because we are limited by space. Associations from Croatia and Europe are coming to help us make the battle and we have, more or less, 300 actors in our show. Fortress Klis is then theater for the event. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1558047316/bvkvnr5kulturjgdlgsv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are doing the reconstruction of the battle of 1532 when Klis briefly fell into ownership of Ottoman Empire. Uskoks were guerrilla unit guarding the way to Adriatic Sea for 30 years against the Ottoman Empire. The goal of Sulejman I. Magnificent was to build a navy on the Split area because of the easier access to Christian capital of Rome. The pope Lion X, calls Uskoks "" <strong>Antemurale Christianitatis</strong>"" which means The bastion of the Christianity. The Uskoks have been top soldiers throughout history. The last time they were mentioned was in the time of the Great War after which they have disbanded. We can safely say that their existence as a soldiers is over 400 years old and today we cherish that story of our forefathers. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHY WE NEED FUNDS?</h2>
<p>We need this money to improve our festival and to have a better offer for all future visitors. Our plan is to build stable, buy horses and donkeys and maybe other animals. We will also build a medieval  children's park with wooden carousel, the pool of shame and another game for children. We will complete the construction of blacksmith where we will make souvenirs on the spot. We'll get more weapons and uniforms. We'll buy armors so the view of our history is even better. We will create a training zone for learning martial arts with swords, spears, bows and arrows, axes and gunpowder weapons. The place for inns where to pour wine from our islands and prepare authentic delicacies of our climate will be made. Our plan is to move visitors away from reality and bring them to medieval history.</p>
<h3>WHAT YOU GET?</h3>
<p>First of all you will get your name on the memorial board because your support to realize the idea is very appreciated. Now, you have the chance to come to our fortress Klis and enjoy all that. We enjoy to share time with our visitors and every visit is an ideal opportunity for a new experience. Our passion is best to shown to you what we share our knowledge with you.</p>

Vi driver företaget Rockdale natur- och kulturupplevelser ekonomisk förening, där vi jobbar med upplevelser och guidningar, med stort fokus på porfyren och dess historia. Sedan juni 2015 driver vi även Porfyr- och Hagströmmuseet, på uppdrag av Älvdalens kommun. </p>
<p>Transporten av Karl XIV Johans sarkofag från Älvdalen 1856 väckte mycket uppmärksamhet. Det var en stor historisk händelse som påverkade många socknar under resans gång. Den transporten är inte så väl dokumenterad och vi vill återskapa en liten bit av denna historiska händelse så historien ska bli lite mer levande. Vi tror och tycker att porfyrern och sarkofagens historia förtjänar lite större plats i rampljuset. Detta eventet inleder också det jubileumsår som vi firar 2018, med olika typer av aktiviteter under hela året.</p>
<p>Ditt bidrag gör att vi kan göra eventet mycket större och skapa en större upplevelse för alla, både för besökarna och för Kungshästarna (dragarna) och andra deltagare i eventet.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Vad vi behöver &amp; Vad du får</h3>
<p>Vår målsättning i den här kampanjen är att få ihop 80 000 kronor. Kostnaderna för hela eventet är mycket högre, och vi vill här passa på att tacka de fantastiska företagare vi har i Älvdalen, som bidrar med tjänster, saker och pengar. Pengarna vi samlar in här går till kostnader som är svårt att få sponsring till av företag. Det är tex:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vissa transportkostnader</li>
<li>Visst material till bygget av kälken</li>
<li>Skyltar och informationsmaterial till eventet</li>
<li>Marschaller och andra ""mysfaktorer""/stämningshöjande faktorer</li>
<li>Hyra av ljud- och ljusutrustning</li>
<li>Minnespokal till det företag/den förening som bidrar med flest dragare</li>
<li>Reseersättning för resor som görs i olika förberedelser </li>
<li>Lunch till Kungshästarna när vi har ""provdragning""</li>
</ul>
<p>Alla som bidrar får något tillbaka! Beroende på hur stort ditt bidrag är så får man entrébiljett eller årskort till Porfyr- och Hagströmmuseet, en bok om porfyren, vykort med porfyrmotiv och/eller en porfyrsten. </p>
<p>Varje krona vi får in kommer att användas till kostnader kring eventet. Om vi inte får in hela beloppet som vår målsättning är, får vi se över och dra ner på bitar som ej är absolut nödvändiga, såsom stämningshöjare. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risker &amp; Utmaningar</h3>
<p>Ibland går det inte exakt som planerat. ""Det stora sarkofagdraget"" är ett stort event där en del saker är ganska komplexa och en stor utmaning. Vi försöker alltid hitta lösningar på hinder och motgångar som kommer upp. Vårt motto, ""Failure is not an option"" (Ett misslyckande är inte ett alternativ), ledsagar oss och peppar oss när saker och ting är motigt och känns tungt, och därför brukar vi hitta vägar för att nå våra mål.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Andra sätt du kan hjälpa till på</h3>
<p>Om du inte kan bidra med pengar, hjälp oss gärna med att sprida den här kampanjen till andra som kanske kan bidra. Använd gärna delningsfunktionerna som finns här på Indiegogo.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Capital City Wrestling was started by a group of wrestling fans from around Montgomery and the surrounding areas. We all love watching and going to wrestling shows, and we wished there was a way we could enjoy it on a regular basis right in our home town. So we decided to do something. We are working with a great promotion out of Munford, AL Victory Championship Wrestling. We have worked out a deal with them to come to Montgomery and put on shows. Our goal for 2020 is to run one show every other month starting in February or March, but this will not be possible unless we have the full support of the Montgomery area wrestling fans. Capital City Wrestling was started by fans and is 100% for the fans. By contributing to and sharing this campaign you are helping ensure Montgomery will have great wrestling for many years to come.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $3000. After paying fees this will leave us enough to put on our first show. We want to put on the absolute best show possible for all the fans and that is going to take some money. We have to secure a suitable venue that can handle an event like ours, we have to pay for security, cleaners, people to help set up and break down the ring, and of course we have to pay the wrestlers. Victory Championship Wrestling has some of the best wrestlers around, from veteran wrestlers who have competed all around the world including WWE to up and coming stars like the Alabama Wrestling Rookie Of The Year. When you contribute you can be proud to know you were here from the beginning and helped make this possible. Besides just being proud we are also offering some great rewards for everyone who contributes. Here are just some of the amazing perks: online shout outs, ringside* seats, In ring photo ops, and even being part of the show. All this and much more. We also have perks available for Sponsors.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are all wrestling fans, and we all wish it was easier to enjoy live wrestling. Montgomery gets to enjoy live wrestling once or twice a year when WWE comes to town, and while that is fun it still leaves a huge hole. We will be providing high quality Independent Wrestling to our community at a much more affordable price year round.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is no risk for our supporters. We are running this as an All or Nothing campaign. That means as long as we reach our goal we will be putting on at least one show, and with the support of the wrestling fans many more after that. If we fail to reach our goal all backers will be refunded.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand not everyone can contribute financially, but you can still help. If you want to support Capital City Wrestling you can do so by sharing this with all your friends. Share this on all your social media platforms and tell your friends and family. We need everyone's help to make sure everyone knows about what we are trying to do. We can't thank everyone enough for all the support. We know with the help of the Wrestling community we will succeed.</p>
<h3>Notes *</h3>
<p>Ringside seats are considered the first 3 rows.</p>
<p>All seats will be first come first serve.</p>
<p>All merchandise vouchers are good during the first show only, and cannot be redeemed for any cash.</p>
<p>Lifetime pass is only good for future CCW shows. and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>You may purchase any perk as a gift, please let us know if this is what you are doing.</p>
