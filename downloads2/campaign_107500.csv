<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Marion Arrou-Vignod and I am a third-year Writing &amp; Producing for Television MFA candidate at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California. I will be shooting my thesis project titled “Checkmate” in January 2019. My preferred genres are science-fiction and supernatural dramas grounded in reality, which touch on contemporary societal issues and the human condition. Nothing and no one are black and white or single-layered: people are walking contradictions. “Checkmate” is the embodiment of that.</p>
<p>“Checkmate” is the story of two best friends, Nash and Logan, who struggle to make ends meet as a private corporation takes over the government’s role in Los Angeles, California. Most Angelenos believe Checkmate to be their savior and so does Nash, but Logan knows different. So, when Nash goes missing and they're running late on rent, Logan goes to find Nash, only to realize something terrible has happened and Checkmate is involved.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>All donations will directly offset the cost of production: food, props, production design, on-set safety, post-production (sound and video editing), original music etc. Any and all donations will be greatly appreciated and put to good use.</p>
<p>On top of production costs, we will submit the sizzle reel to festivals around the country and even the world, in the hopes of showcasing what the actual series can look like to potential producers/buyers. A successful crowdfunding campaign can make a big difference in the careers of my cast and crew.</p>

<h3>What is My d20 Stories?</h3>
<p>First off, what the heck is a d20? Well, it's a twenty-sided die that has become synonymous with Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other pen &amp; paper role-playing games.<br/><br/>My d20 Stories is an idea I've been kicking around my cavernous noggin for the past few years, and I'm finally making myself make it happen.  What is it exactly, though? Well, imagine a thirty-something actor based in Los Angeles, who grew up in Long Beach, CA in the 1990s, and has been playing D&amp;D since the tender age of 15. </p>
<p>I'll be telling those stories to the camera, with each episode using one of the many d20s in my collection as a jumping-off point for the story. The first episode, for example, will be about the circumstances and happenings around the first d20 I ever acquired: a smoke-grey translucent Chessex d20 with white numbers - part of a 10-die set that I purchased from my local gaming shop.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's something interesting in there, right? My eventual goal is to get some of the other people I know that play tabletop dice-based rpgs to share their stories on the show in the same fashion. Guests abound.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm asking for $2500 - to cover equipment and production costs. I'm looking to get a portable recorder like a Zoom H4n, as well some lighting to help it all look snazzy. I also need to expand the storage capacity on my editing computer, so another couple of hard drives, one for backup.  Additionally, paying for stock footage/images, music, and sound will be an expense.  Finally, a portion of the budget will go to helping me out as I'll be carving out a good chunk of time to get this all written, shot, and edited.</p>
<p>There are a list of perks which I'm offering as a thank you, with more in the works if we get closer to (or even exceed, haha) the funding goal. </p>
<p><strong>In the long run</strong>, if My d20 Stories does well, I want to expand my breadth of content - and get back into producing video sketches and music.</p>
<p>If you can help at this stage, we're looking at a vast myriad of online content. VAST. J/k. It'll be a modest myriad.</p>

<p><strong>GREAT NEWS!  We've reached our bare-bones production goal, and have greenlit Season 1!  Now we're reaching for our STRETCH GOAL of $45,000, which will enable us to have modern 4K cameras, quality sound, vivid production values, and location rentals.  But we need your help!  Here's what we need:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- If we reach $30,000, we'll give all contributors of $125 or more two free tickets to ""EXTRA ROOM: THE MUSIC,"" a concert in NYC featuring the great up-and-coming bands and artists who are lending their voices to the show;</strong></p>
<p><b>- If we reach $38,000, all contributors of $150 or more will receive a special USB thumb drive with loads of unseen content, including our behind-the-scenes ""blooper reel"" and the shooting scripts from the first season; </b></p>
<p><b>- If we reach $45,000, we'll shoot an extra mini-episode, showing you the 'lost footage' from a hilariously disastrous cooking show made by two of our characters, Sava and Beau.  (Think Beavis and Butthead, if they were super-gay.  More than they already are.) </b></p>
<p><strong>Here's what the show's about:</strong></p>
<p> On <i>Friends, </i>the apartment was the size of Brazil.  <i>Sex and the City </i>lived in penthouses.  <i>Will and Grace</i> get hammered daily in their luxury condo.  And sure, <i>Girls</i> SAID they were broke, but the digs seemed pretty sweet to us.</p>
<p>The sitcom version of New York City is NOT the real New York...not the one we know, at least, where budding artists, immigrants, and dreamers band together in small apartments to split costs, share warmth, and get closer to the subway. </p>
<p>Welcome to EXTRA ROOM, a web series about OUR New York City, right now, in 2019.  Living large in tiny spaces, rapidly accelerating, searching for answers.</p>
<p>Our production company, <a href=""http://www.acertainsomething.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A Certain Something</a>, brought together a creative team for EXTRA ROOM who have won Obie Awards, written <i>New York Times </i>bestsellers, screened at Cannes, and won both film festivals and national playwriting awards. </p>
<p>We chose to make EXTRA ROOM from a desire to hear different voices, to realign perceptions of urban living, and bring an intersectional, diverse, pro-sex sensibility to characters like us, who aren't represented on television.  The scripts for Season One have already received praise from creative minds behind <i>Pose</i>, <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>, <i>Bear City</i>, and <i>The Bourne Identity.</i></p>
<p>We hope you like New York the way we do...weird, spicy, sexy, and knee-slappingly hilarious!  We'll take you on an emotional ride through bad dates on the Lower East Side, concerts in SoHo, breakups in Bushwick, gay brunches in Harlem, booty calls in Washington Heights, and ambulances in Inwood.  You are the driving force behind EXTRA ROOM, and we want you to be a part of it!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're trying to raise at least $25,000 here on Indiegogo, and hopefully more of our overall budget of $100,000 to shoot the six episodes of Season One.  It's real television -- each episode is a full 22-minutes!  There are over two dozen locations, 35 speaking roles, and a production crew of nearly 60.  This graph spells it out where the budget goes:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543375954/vukknoxe8h0qfipdgjbe.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The great news: through private funding and this campaign, we've already covered much of our post-production budget!  We've made it to our minimum goal, but we're hoping to raise <strong>$45,000</strong> here, which will allow us the resources to fully realize our dream show.  Any additional funds raised will greatly enhance our production and location options.  If we don't reach our entire goal, we will begin production while pursuing additional funding to complete the season.</p>
<p>We've got some VERY unique perks in store for you, to show our gratitude.  You can name a character in someone's honor (Aunt Phyllis? RuPaul? Queen Elizabeth?), or spend a day on the set with us.  We've got tickets to our World Premiere, and roles you can play onscreen!  My favorite idea came from the cast -- they want to do a total makeover of your dating app profile!  Personally, we hope you'll grab our power lunches, or truly magnificent swag items....check out the entire list of perks on the right, and be sure to read the benefits inside...we've hidden a few ""Easter Eggs"" there -- surprise benefits to make them extra special!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our writers were challenged to create characters they'd never seen on television before.  And wow, did they deliver -- non-binary farmhands, sexy gay bears, genderfluid chefs, post-Trump immigrants. We're disturbed by shows populated exclusively by white characters...or for that matter, exclusively black characters, or exclusively LatinX characters, etc.  Doesn't anyone have friends like us, of many races, heritages and backgrounds?  Can we all be on one show? </p>
<p>We feel strongly about shattering traditional notions of beauty on  EXTRA ROOM -- tall and short, skinny and thick, dark and light, different sizes and shapes, and intergenerational relationships are all a part of our story.  This is the world as we know it, and the world we want to share.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>This kind of story isn't for everyone, of course...but we think we're on to something.  EXTRA ROOM builds and expands upon the worldview espoused by <i>Pose</i>, <i>Insecure</i>, <i>This Is Us</i>, <i>Sense8</i>, <i>Orange is the New Black</i>, <i>Master of None</i> and <i>Atlanta</i>...all of which successfully explore peculiar and specific lives, with authenticity, savvy humor, and freshness.</p>
<p>As a team, we've got over 75 combined years of experience telling stories like this, in a variety of mediums.  We just need a little help to make this peculiar, specific, beautiful, compelling, addictive story a reality!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We really hope you'll contribute...even $15 would make a huge difference to this effort.  If you can't, however, there are other ways to help!</p>
<p>First, we hope you'll share this Indiegogo Campaign on your social media, and encourage people to participate...let 'em know how much you care about stories like this! </p>
<p>And please, share us via email to anyone who might like EXTRA ROOM...we're building a community person by person, and your help would be invaluable!</p>

We're trying to raise at least $25,000 here on Indiegogo, and hopefully more of our overall budget of $100,000 to shoot the six episodes of Season One.  It's real television -- each episode is a full 22-minutes!  There are over two dozen locations, 35 speaking roles, and a production crew of nearly 60.  This graph spells it out where the budget goes:

The great news: through private funding and this campaign, we've already covered much of our post-production budget!  We've made it to our minimum goal, but we're hoping to raise $45,000 here, which will allow us the resources to fully realize our dream show.  Any additional funds raised will greatly enhance our production and location options.  If we don't reach our entire goal, we will begin production while pursuing additional funding to complete the season.
We've got some VERY unique perks in store for you, to show our gratitude.  You can name a character in someone's honor (Aunt Phyllis? RuPaul? Queen Elizabeth?), or spend a day on the set with us.  We've got tickets to our World Premiere, and roles you can play onscreen!  My favorite idea came from the cast -- they want to do a total makeover of your dating app profile!  Personally, we hope you'll grab our power lunches, or truly magnificent swag items....check out the entire list of perks on the right, and be sure to read the benefits inside...we've hidden a few ""Easter Eggs"" there -- surprise benefits to make them extra special!

The Impact
Our writers were challenged to create characters they'd never seen on television before.  And wow, did they deliver -- non-binary farmhands, sexy gay bears, genderfluid chefs, post-Trump immigrants. We're disturbed by shows populated exclusively by white characters...or for that matter, exclusively black characters, or exclusively LatinX characters, etc.  Doesn't anyone have friends like us, of many races, heritages and backgrounds?  Can we all be on one show? 
We feel strongly about shattering traditional notions of beauty on  EXTRA ROOM -- tall and short, skinny and thick, dark and light, different sizes and shapes, and intergenerational relationships are all a part of our story.  This is the world as we know it, and the world we want to share.

Risks and Challenges
This kind of story isn't for everyone, of course...but we think we're on to something.  EXTRA ROOM builds and expands upon the worldview espoused by Pose, Insecure, This Is Us, Sense8, Orange is the New Black, Master of None and Atlanta...all of which successfully explore peculiar and specific lives, with authenticity, savvy humor, and freshness.
As a team, we've got over 75 combined years of experience telling stories like this, in a variety of mediums.  We just need a little help to make this peculiar, specific, beautiful, compelling, addictive story a reality!


Other Ways You Can Help
We really hope you'll contribute...even $15 would make a huge difference to this effort.  If you can't, however, there are other ways to help!
First, we hope you'll share this Indiegogo Campaign on your social media, and encourage people to participate...let 'em know how much you care about stories like this! 
And please, share us via email to anyone who might like EXTRA ROOM...we're building a community person by person, and your help would be invaluable!

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We may be serious filmmakers but we love to have fun. We really think <i>HighBread</i> will be an amazing collaborative that will remove stereotypes from Indian/Southwest Asian culture as well as address issues and spark conversations that surrounds the legalization of marijuana (a very recent event in Boston as well as other parts of the United States).</p>
<p>With you contributing:</p>
<ul>
<li>We anticipate this pilot to picked up by a major television network and/or streaming service (ie- Hulu, Netflix, Amazon)</li>
<li>We already have been green-lit by Boston University for starting funds to support our project</li>
<li>We believe in this story and that's why we want nothing but the best to not only succeed, but become a hit both in the U.S. and India.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With budgeting and prepping for all the pre-production we are looking for $10,000 for this 30-min pilot alone (bare-bones minimum). We already have $3,000 from an angel investor. The remaining $7,000 will be for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transportation &amp; Catering costs for Cast/Crew ($2500)</li>
<li>Additional equipment rental (lenses, etc.) not housed by Boston University ($1500)</li>
<li>Editing/Post-Production ($1500)</li>
<li>Music Score/Sound Design ($1000)</li>
<li>Production Design &amp; Wardrobe ($1500)</li>
</ul>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While this pilot is fairly contained in terms of production, it has its own challenges that come with shooting an episodic pilot inside a bakery as a masters student.</p>
<p>The first challenge is one we have already conquered: getting permission from Boston University to produce this story. We have been in touch with New York scriptwriter Daniel Blanda through pre-production and have been editing and table reading the tar out of this story. We also have been working closely with film director Paul Schneider (Baywatch, JAG) for production advice and mentorship.</p>
<p>The second challenge is applying for insurance and permits to film in locations that are not covered by the university. Again, our team is currently working through that, and we seem to be on the right track to get all the permits and insurances necessary.</p>
<p>Once we are fully funded, that should be the extent of our challenges, past the obvious ones of actually shooting the film.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are glad you asked!!! In today's day and age, word of mouth is everything.  We think we got a pretty cool idea on our hands, and we believe the video speaks for itself.  Sharing our campaign would be extremely beneficial, or informing people of who we are, and how we are different would help spread the message of unique independent filmmaking.</p>

The first season scripts are all written and we’re ready to pounce into production as soon as we have the funds. Over the next 45 days, you have the ability to bring this pilot several steps closer to becoming a full season of comedy television. </p><p><strong>What's in it for you?</strong></p><p>Now for the fun part. We’ve put a lot of thought into what we can offer our backers a.k.a., our Heroes. We think many of the campaigns that forged a path before us had some great ideas, so you’ll see a few familiar incentives.

We're constantly inspired by filmmakers who fiercely protect their creative integrity.

Our incentives will provide you with updates and opportunities to put your own stamp on the series! </p><p><b>Where does the money go?</b></p><p>We have a small, but incredibly talented and proficient team of independent filmmakers — a team that’s worked together on multiple projects over the years — actors, producers, cinematographers, sound mixers and set designers who have spent a decade carving out an efficient and effective system to create peak production value on a modest budget.</p><p>If you care to see for yourself, check out LOST ON PURPOSE on iTunes; WAFFLE STREET on Netflix; or perhaps SMALL TOWN CRIME, also on Netflix now, which just enjoyed a theatrical run.

Our shoot will last around two months and with a cast and crew of around 15-25 people, it will take significant funds to compensate these warriors fairly. There will also be insurance to buy, food for the crew, cameras to rent, lenses to rent, lights to rent, music licensing and all post-production costs (editing, sound mixing, color grading) amongst a truckload of other line items.

While some consider season two to be ""the best season"", that distinction continues to be widely and fervently debated.</i></p></div>","So here we are...Stephen Colletti and James Lafferty. Friends, colleagues and now collaborators. Some of you may know us from our time on ""One Tree Hill"", some of you may know us personally, and many of you probably don't know us at all. Regardless, we're here to introduce you to a project near and dear to our hearts.""Everyone is Doing Great"" is an episodic comedy project we’ve lived and breathed for the last year of our lives. It’s a story formed partly from circumstances we’re familiar with, but primarily a fiction following friends dealing with life’s unexpected challenges.  If you think it’s worth your contribution, small or large, you’ll be satisfying the budget for 5 more 30-40 minute episodes of “Everyone is Doing Great.” That’ll make our first season 6 total episodes. The first season scripts are all written and we’re ready to pounce into production as soon as we have the funds. Over the next 45 days, you have the ability to bring this pilot several steps closer to becoming a full season of comedy television. What's in it for you?Now for the fun part. We’ve put a lot of thought into what we can offer our backers a.k.a., our Heroes. We think many of the campaigns that forged a path before us had some great ideas, so you’ll see a few familiar incentives. We also sprinkled in a few things we think are fun and original, but we’ll let you be the judge of that. We’re grateful for every cent put forward and are looking forward to expressing that gratitude through these incentives and more!Shooting the pilot episode of 'Everyone is Doing Great'. Stephen Colletti (Writer/Actor) touching the monitor after Johnny Derango (D.P./E.P.) told him to keep his greasy-ass fingers off it -- for the millionth time. Ian and Eshom Nelms (E.P.s) look on in bewilderment.Why are we crowdfunding?In an ever-changing landscape of Film and TV, more and more people are taking matters into their own hands and seeing incredible results. We're constantly inspired by filmmakers who fiercely protect their creative integrity. Crowdfunding our budget allows us to do exactly that. We want to remind creatives and audiences alike that there's always interest — and room — for great content. Here you will not only support “Everyone is Doing Great,”  you will also be showing your belief in independent television.We’re grateful to take this route because it gives us more creative freedom and the ability to take you on the journey with us — every step of the way. Our incentives will provide you with updates and opportunities to put your own stamp on the series! Where does the money go?We have a small, but incredibly talented and proficient team of independent filmmakers — a team that’s worked together on multiple projects over the years — actors, producers, cinematographers, sound mixers and set designers who have spent a decade carving out an efficient and effective system to create peak production value on a modest budget.If you care to see for yourself, check out LOST ON PURPOSE on iTunes; WAFFLE STREET on Netflix; or perhaps SMALL TOWN CRIME, also on Netflix now, which just enjoyed a theatrical run. All of them are brought to you by our creative team, including Writer/Producer/Director duo Ian and Eshom Nelms, Cinematographer/Producer Johnny Derango and Actress/Producer Michelle Lang — all of whom serve as Executive Producers on “EDG.” Any one of these projects should assure you that the season of “EDG"" we create will be completely consistent in quality. You can count on that. Since we already completed the pilot on our own, these funds will pay for the production of 5 additional episodes to make a total of one complete 6 episode season. Our efforts to help minimize production costs will include using several locations we personally own, shooting all episodes on one schedule to save time, and taking nominal pay rates relative to industry standards. Johnny Derango and Eshom Nelms wonder how they got here as James Lafferty (Actor/Director) encourages them to violate safety regulations by illegally crossing the street. Again.But no matter how cost-effective we are, there will be expenses. Our shoot will last around two months and with a cast and crew of around 15-25 people, it will take significant funds to compensate these warriors fairly. There will also be insurance to buy, food for the crew, cameras to rent, lenses to rent, lights to rent, music licensing and all post-production costs (editing, sound mixing, color grading) amongst a truckload of other line items. Oh and that reminds us, we'll need to rent a truck as well.All things considered, the number we’ve set for this campaign allows us to make a season of ""Everyone is Doing Great"" for the very least amount of money possible. Down to the last woman and man, we are a filmmaking team dedicated to the passion and love for storytelling first. Want to see the pilot?As we mentioned in our video, the ""Everyone is Doing Great"" pilot is screening at film and television festivals around the world this year. Check out ""Everyone is Doing Great"" on the EDG social media accounts - Facebook, Instagram and Twitter - for updates on our festival tour. Come check out the show, mingle with our creative team, and let us know what you think.Shooting the pilot's opening sequence.

<h3><strong>Once Upon a (Very Weird) Time...</strong></h3>
<p>For those who don’t know me, I’m a writer and entertainer based in Nottingham UK. I also work as an event producer, storyteller, workshop facilitator, and dabble in music, makeup, podcasting - all sorts of fun stuff!</p>
<p>I’ve been very fortunate in that I'd been working full time in the arts until self-isolating began. The downside is my income relied on curating and performing at events which are now all cancelled or postponed until further notice. </p>
<p>People I’ve performed to or worked with have been wonderfully generous by continuing to support my work from afar, but I really miss being out in the community, entertaining people and just… all of it really. So, what I want to do while waiting to get back to work is create an online show that's fun and ridiculous and suitable for all!</p>
<p>""Stories from the Back of the Cupboard"" (a mini-series of 5 episodes) is 'Mr Ben' when he can’t leave the house to pop to the costume shop. Virtual storytelling for the self-isolating where ""Jackanory"" meets ""The Mighty Boosh.""</p>
<p>Influenced by our current situation, each day you’ll find me as the narrator stuck at home, running out of things to do,  clearing out another area of the house. It's during these deep cleans that I’ll lean in too close, fall “through the back of the cupboard” and discover the story of a character that’s been long forgotten, or previously undiscovered. Think an alien in the attic, a yeti in the freezer, or a hermit hidden amongst the Tupperware...</p>
<p>Every scene will be filmed in and around my house and home studio space (i.e. the spare room with a green screen pinned to the wall) in order to create the fantastical scenes! </p>
<p>The series will be posted online one episode each evening starting Monday June 1st 2020 until Friday 5th, on both Facebook and YouTube. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Funding Bit</strong></h3>
<p><i>If for some reason the campaign goes bananas, I’ll donate 50% of any funds received over target to <a href=""https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mermaids charity</a>  The rest will help support my future creative endeavours i.e. keeping a roof over mine and my cat’s heads. </i></p>
<p>There's a lot which will go into this mini-series, and I'm doing it all single-handed. This includes developing the characters, writing their stories, filming the show, editing and producing the final episodes, along with making the music, props, sets, costumes, doing the makeup, and a little set aside for some paid advertising to reach as many homes as possible!</p>
<p>Supporting this project will help me keep going as an artist for the foreseeable and uncertain future but I don't want summat for nowt! There are some amazing perks to supporting this project, including event tickets, one of a kind creations, limited edition t-shirts, online private tutorials with yours truly, and more!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Ambitions beyond the cupboard...</strong></h3>
<p>The series will be for everyone; those living in isolation and those crammed together as ad hoc family units. It'll be colourful and eye-catching and psychedelic, with characters that captivate younger audiences, but appeal to all through the very relatable setting; you're stuck at home, rediscovering stuff you forgot you had but maybe find out a bit more about yourself, others, and the world immediately around you.</p>
<p>The episode themes will be universal, light-hearted, for anyone watching it to be entertained without feeling pandered to! Mostly I just wanted to get people talking with each other while self-isolating, or if they’re more isolated than most, to feel a little less alone.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Sounds like a lot, right? </strong></h3>
<p>Yes, it's a massive project for one person but with all this free time when better to undertake such a challenge! Nevertheless, I'll be updating this page and my social medias with progress posts and sneak peeks as I go along. That way supporters can see some behind the scenes shenanigans of what they're helping create! </p>

<h3>COVID Ditty is keeping New York Actors Creative and Working Through Tough Times</h3>
<p>A Bronx-bred, film-TV-theater actor, Steve is a character actor who typically plays working-class people. Sometimes, he plays complementary roles such as an attorney opposite a headliner, like multiple Grammy- and Tony-Award winner Patti LaPone in FX’s hit show POSE. </p>
<p>But the COVID-19 pandemic has changed things, including Steve. After months of isolation and continuous death-toll updates, he subconsciously decided to squint so he could see the humor amid the wreckage.</p>
<p>“There is a place for the human expression of some sort of  joy—or we would have all gone crazy,” says Steve, who shook the room with his booming voice as the miserable Ghost of Jacob Marley in A Christmas Carol in Harlem at the Classic Theater of Harlem—before the pandemic shut down everything.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Steve saw juxtapositions and inequities everywhere. Schools and houses of worship closed down, but liquor stores, fast-food joints and the state lottery were open for business. Teachers expressed concern about going back to work, while minimum-wage workers at McDonald’s dished “essential” burgers seemingly around the clock.</p>
<p>With Broadway locked down, Steve has started a new NYC production during the pandemic—about the pandemic—with his own cobbled-together life savings. He recently began writing an eight-part “dramedy”—COVID Ditty—a series of short vignettes that captures glimpses of oddities and ironies that we have all been too numb to fully digest. Steve is the writer, the director and the lead as “Phil”, who is a simple, lumbering, lunch-pail guy trying to make sense of the new world order.</p>
<p>Steve’s other new role is one of job creator. So far, he has hired SAG-AFTRA actors, like himself, for Episode 1, as well as an editor, a Go Pro cameraman, someone in charge of music, a production team and a digital marketing firm with a publicist to get the word out. </p>
<p>According to Steve, New York City is the tale of two cities: the posh “Goldman Sachs New York” who have the resources to cut and run to the Hamptons, Miami or points beyond when the going gets tough and the blue-collar families who grind and endure, making the city’s gears turn every day—even when the New York Post’s headline screams, “New York City is Dead Forever.”</p>
<p>“COVID Ditty is a New Yorker’s love letter to his neighborhood,” Steve says. “It’s a love letter for the people who went through 9/11 and the people who are going through this pandemic—and they are still HERE. They love the city. They see the good in people. They are rising above the news, all the partisan anger and rancor. They are regular joes, trying to get by. There are plenty of those people out there.” Now COVID Ditty hopes to keep production of the additional episodes  moving forward with help from the greater community. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Help Keep COVID Ditty Progressing....</h3>
<p>Steve, in his own words:</p>
<p>I always bet on a sure thing. The COVID Ditty web series is a testament to the hard-working NYC families who have chosen to stay and fight. I have reached into my SAG-AFTRA retirement savings to produce the first scripts for Season One, but I need your help to finish the eight-part series. We have actors, an editor and a production team counting on us. We are an economic engine that is putting money into the local Bronx economy. Every time a coffee is bought over a script meeting, a lunch is served on set or an interior location is used, a local Kingsbridge business benefits. The arts are job creators! If you believe New Yorkers don’t quit, please make a contribution today to keep this work alive. For donations more than $60, I’ll throw in a t-shirt that captures this memorable work during an unforgettable time.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>ALL donations will keep the show in production and contribute to keeping NY artists and crew working through this difficult time that has especially impacted artists and creatives across this city, the country and the world.</p>
<ul>
<li>Support NYC actors and neighborhoods</li>
<li>Contribute to a heartfelt, relevant series that can share light to many during a difficult time.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Teachers expressed concern about going back to work, while minimum-wage workers at McDonald’s dished “essential” burgers seemingly around the clock.
With Broadway locked down, Steve has started a new NYC production during the pandemic—about the pandemic—with his own cobbled-together life savings. He recently began writing an eight-part “dramedy”—COVID Ditty—a series of short vignettes that captures glimpses of oddities and ironies that we have all been too numb to fully digest. Steve is the writer, the director and the lead as “Phil”, who is a simple, lumbering, lunch-pail guy trying to make sense of the new world order.
Steve’s other new role is one of job creator. So far, he has hired SAG-AFTRA actors, like himself, for Episode 1, as well as an editor, a Go Pro cameraman, someone in charge of music, a production team and a digital marketing firm with a publicist to get the word out. 
According to Steve, New York City is the tale of two cities: the posh “Goldman Sachs New York” who have the resources to cut and run to the Hamptons, Miami or points beyond when the going gets tough and the blue-collar families who grind and endure, making the city’s gears turn every day—even when the New York Post’s headline screams, “New York City is Dead Forever.”
“COVID Ditty is a New Yorker’s love letter to his neighborhood,” Steve says. “It’s a love letter for the people who went through 9/11 and the people who are going through this pandemic—and they are still HERE. They love the city. They see the good in people. They are rising above the news, all the partisan anger and rancor. They are regular joes, trying to get by. There are plenty of those people out there.” Now COVID Ditty hopes to keep production of the additional episodes  moving forward with help from the greater community. 
 
Help Keep COVID Ditty Progressing....
Steve, in his own words:
I always bet on a sure thing. The COVID Ditty web series is a testament to the hard-working NYC families who have chosen to stay and fight. I have reached into my SAG-AFTRA retirement savings to produce the first scripts for Season One, but I need your help to finish the eight-part series. We have actors, an editor and a production team counting on us. We are an economic engine that is putting money into the local Bronx economy. Every time a coffee is bought over a script meeting, a lunch is served on set or an interior location is used, a local Kingsbridge business benefits. The arts are job creators! If you believe New Yorkers don’t quit, please make a contribution today to keep this work alive. For donations more than $60, I’ll throw in a t-shirt that captures this memorable work during an unforgettable time.
The Impact
ALL donations will keep the show in production and contribute to keeping NY artists and crew working through this difficult time that has especially impacted artists and creatives across this city, the country and the world.

Support NYC actors and neighborhoods
Contribute to a heartfelt, relevant series that can share light to many during a difficult time.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Meet the Co-Creators of Apartment 101</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Heather Abbott</strong> </i>graduated from Stephen F. Austin State University with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theatre Performance. Before her college experience, she studied film all four years of high school. She is a Kamp Hollywood alum and is excited to work on a film set once more. </p>
<p><strong><i>Breanna Benedict</i></strong> graduated from Columbia College Chicago with a Bachelor of Arts in Acting. Growing up, she was always performing on the stage. Then in college, she caught the screen acting bug and is ready to get back in front of the camera.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Apartment 101</strong> started out as an inside joke. Then, after hours of banter, Heather and Breanna finally sat down and started writing. Three months later, ten episodes had been written, re-written, and re-re-written. It was time to assemble the troops. As of today, the first two episodes have been completely filmed; however, as production continues, expenses will begin to pile up. Donation to our campaign will help us to make this project a reality, while still being able to pay rent. </p>

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Trillo &amp; Suede is a multi-award-winning film noir parody web series, featuring a ventriloquist detective and his wooden partner. It is the Winner for Best Web Series, Best Comedy, Best Noir, Best Music and other Top Awards in 27 international film contests. </p>
<p>Episode 1 of ten weekly episodes comprising Season 1 was released on Jan. 1, 2020.  Season 2 began on Nov. 1, 2020 with the first of ten weekly episodes. Seasons 1 and 2 can be seen on our YouTube channel: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/c/TrilloSuede"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/c/TrilloSuede</a> - and on our Vimeo channel: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/trilloandsuede"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vimeo.com/trilloandsuede</a></p>
<p>I (Jonathan Geffner) am the writer/creator/executive producer/lead actor.  A real-life professional ventriloquist, I play the roles of both Trillo and Suede.</p>
<p>Having self-funded both Seasons 1 and 2 I am no longer able to self-fund this project. Producing another 10-episode season would require at least $35,000 on a very tight budget. I felt it would be very difficult to crowd fund $35,000, so I decided to set a more achievable goal of $18,000 in order to produce an abbreviated Season 3 of only five episodes.  </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">If we exceed our $18,000 goal I will use the money as far as it will go to produce additional Season 3 episodes. If we fall short of our goal I will shoot fewer episodes. If we fall far short of our goal my fallback plan is to use whatever money I have to produce just one short film. </span></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Every dollar of your contribution will go toward the production of Trillo &amp; Suede Season 3. Our $18,000 goal will barely cover the cost of shooting and editing an abbreviated, five-episode Season 3 on a very tight budget. If we are fortunate enough to surpass our goal, every dollar of it will go toward expanding the number of episodes and/or adding production value to the episodes.</p>
<p>All of our talented cast and crew will be working for very modest fees because of their enthusiasm for and belief in the Trillo &amp; Suede project. But even modest fees will add up quickly. Plus there will be equipment rental fees, location fees, transportation fees, cost of insurance, props and wardrobe, and lots of nutritious food to keep our cast and crew well-fed and energetic throughout the grueling-yet-exciting shoot. </p>
<p>Your support will enable the unique, exciting, hilarious Trillo &amp; Suede web series to continue, while allowing yourself to become part of its history. Plus, you'll get some cool perks in appreciation for your support.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Trillo & Suede is a multi-award-winning film noir parody web series, featuring a ventriloquist detective and his wooden partner. It is the Winner for Best Web Series, Best Comedy, Best Noir, Best Music and other Top Awards in 27 international film contests. 
Episode 1 of ten weekly episodes comprising Season 1 was released on Jan. 1, 2020.  Season 2 began on Nov. 1, 2020 with the first of ten weekly episodes. Seasons 1 and 2 can be seen on our YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/TrilloSuede - and on our Vimeo channel: https://vimeo.com/trilloandsuede
I (Jonathan Geffner) am the writer/creator/executive producer/lead actor.  A real-life professional ventriloquist, I play the roles of both Trillo and Suede.
Having self-funded both Seasons 1 and 2 I am no longer able to self-fund this project. Producing another 10-episode season would require at least $35,000 on a very tight budget. I felt it would be very difficult to crowd fund $35,000, so I decided to set a more achievable goal of $18,000 in order to produce an abbreviated Season 3 of only five episodes.  
If we exceed our $18,000 goal I will use the money as far as it will go to produce additional Season 3 episodes. If we fall short of our goal I will shoot fewer episodes. If we fall far short of our goal my fallback plan is to use whatever money I have to produce just one short film. 

What We Need & What You Get
Every dollar of your contribution will go toward the production of Trillo & Suede Season 3. Our $18,000 goal will barely cover the cost of shooting and editing an abbreviated, five-episode Season 3 on a very tight budget. If we are fortunate enough to surpass our goal, every dollar of it will go toward expanding the number of episodes and/or adding production value to the episodes.
All of our talented cast and crew will be working for very modest fees because of their enthusiasm for and belief in the Trillo & Suede project. But even modest fees will add up quickly. Plus there will be equipment rental fees, location fees, transportation fees, cost of insurance, props and wardrobe, and lots of nutritious food to keep our cast and crew well-fed and energetic throughout the grueling-yet-exciting shoot. 
Your support will enable the unique, exciting, hilarious Trillo & Suede web series to continue, while allowing yourself to become part of its history. Plus, you'll get some cool perks in appreciation for your support.

<p><i>The filmmakers behind ""The Coroner's Assistant"" have each been part of their own completed projects, and brought their unique skills to the table to create the pilot for the series.</i></p>
<p><strong>Angeline Walsh (Writer/Director), </strong>has made two feature films as an independent filmmaker in Cleveland, Ohio. Her first feature, 21st Century Spectacle, a 1920s-style silent film, won Best First Feature at the L-Dub Film Festival in 2016, as well as being featured in the Broken Knuckle Film Festival that same year. Her 2016 film, A Murder Party, won best Indie Feature (December 2017) at the Festigious Los Angeles Monthly Film Competition and 4th place in the Short Drama-Comedy competition at the 2017 Indie Gathering Film Festival. Her self-published poetry collection, “Bad Psychiatry,” was released in 2018, and she is currently in the process of recording an accompanying audiobook. She blames her thanatological fixations on having visited too many catacombs as a child.</p>
<p><strong>Giorgiana Lascu (Producer), </strong>started her career as a producer in high school where she took a friend’s address book and bullied half a dozen friends into coming over to make a film called Psychotown. Since then she has produced several independent web series, sketches, and short films. Her production work includes production coordinating and assistant producing the documentary mini-series Plate Up, and includes freelance work as a second assistant director and music supervisor. A recent theatre graduate from Cleveland State University, she was the first recipient of the Tony Weinert Theatre Scholarship, the departmental academic scholarship, and a leadership scholarship for her work as a reporter and business manager of the college newspaper “The Cauldron.” She also served on the General Fee Committee championing vibrant creative endeavors, and is an adamant supporter and believer in independent film.</p>
<p><strong>Dagna Griffin (Director of Photography),</strong> is a classically trained filmmaker and perfectionist. She was a Video Production Specialist for IBM for 5 years, where she created an abundance of creative marketing videos as a “one person video crew.” Presently, as the owner of Dagna Griffin Creative, she produces a variety of unique and intimate films for weddings, real estate, birth, and more. Her dedication to visual detail and capturing perfect moments makes her cinematography captivating and engaging.</p>

</div></div>","The Creative Team
 

The filmmakers behind ""The Coroner's Assistant"" have each been part of their own completed projects, and brought their unique skills to the table to create the pilot for the series.
Angeline Walsh (Writer/Director), has made two feature films as an independent filmmaker in Cleveland, Ohio. Her first feature, 21st Century Spectacle, a 1920s-style silent film, won Best First Feature at the L-Dub Film Festival in 2016, as well as being featured in the Broken Knuckle Film Festival that same year. Her 2016 film, A Murder Party, won best Indie Feature (December 2017) at the Festigious Los Angeles Monthly Film Competition and 4th place in the Short Drama-Comedy competition at the 2017 Indie Gathering Film Festival. Her self-published poetry collection, “Bad Psychiatry,” was released in 2018, and she is currently in the process of recording an accompanying audiobook. She blames her thanatological fixations on having visited too many catacombs as a child.
Giorgiana Lascu (Producer), started her career as a producer in high school where she took a friend’s address book and bullied half a dozen friends into coming over to make a film called Psychotown. Since then she has produced several independent web series, sketches, and short films. Her production work includes production coordinating and assistant producing the documentary mini-series Plate Up, and includes freelance work as a second assistant director and music supervisor. A recent theatre graduate from Cleveland State University, she was the first recipient of the Tony Weinert Theatre Scholarship, the departmental academic scholarship, and a leadership scholarship for her work as a reporter and business manager of the college newspaper “The Cauldron.” She also served on the General Fee Committee championing vibrant creative endeavors, and is an adamant supporter and believer in independent film.
Dagna Griffin (Director of Photography), is a classically trained filmmaker and perfectionist. She was a Video Production Specialist for IBM for 5 years, where she created an abundance of creative marketing videos as a “one person video crew.” Presently, as the owner of Dagna Griffin Creative, she produces a variety of unique and intimate films for weddings, real estate, birth, and more. Her dedication to visual detail and capturing perfect moments makes her cinematography captivating and engaging.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have 35 years in business start ups - some good and some bad. The bad ones you really learn from. In 2011, I was one of the first investors in the new Equity Crowdfunding (ECF) scene. Since then I have been battling to increase knowledge levels for investors; to help them make better decisions and give them a degree of information symmetry. My views are often quoted in national papers like The Times, The Sunday Times, The Herald and The Financial Times and online sources like CityAM, Bloomberg, The Memo and Altfi News, as well as specialist sector publications like The Caterer and BikeBiz.com.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We think ECF is a fantastic way for ordinary people to get involved in start up businesses. We love start ups and at a time when banks have all but given up funding them, this is an essential resource for UKplc. But to make the most of it, people need to be able to see the potholes and avoid the more obvious pitfalls. The ECF investment platforms do not offer this service. At ECF Solutions Ltd, we are totally independent and our main goal is to help you.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>SLAG is a controversial, slap in the face short film set in today’s post hopscotch world, where teens are digital natives and a young girl’s first time is documented on social media. Geared towards a youthful and tech-savvy audience, it presents a universal insight into how we can use social media platforms today and how toxic masculinity and infect the lives of young people. We believe this important message would be perfect for film festivals that invite innovative and thought provoking ideas such as SXSW, Filckerfest, MIFF and Byron Bay International Film Festival among others. After it’s festival circuit we intend to release the film across all social media platforms in the hopes of  bringing awareness and inspire debates on the topics of social media use, consent and how sex is perceived in today's culture of oversharing. We would really appreciate your support in telling this unique and important story.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Fran just got a new job. She's the newest hire at Friend inDeed, and she has no idea what she's about to get into. Each episode of Rent a Friend will follow Fran's adventures with a new client, like a newly-certified yoga instructor whose friends refuse to come to her first class, a lonely boi trying to adjust to a new city, and a team of LARPers who need a mercenary.</p>
<p>She'll be fine, as long as she avoids the three Fs of Friendship: No Flaking, No Fucking, No Freud.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>Sophie's background is in <a href=""http://www.sophieworm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">graphics &amp; editing</a>. She studied animation at California College of the Arts and has since worked for some of New York's top post-production houses. When she's not cutting spots for web &amp; TV, you can probably find her creating breathtaking illustrations. </p>
<p>Emily's background is in <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRK-hqc92PU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">performance and comedic writing</a>. After attending a performing arts high school, she went on to study French literature because reading in English was too easy. She studied at UCB and has performed stand up, improv &amp; sketch comedy all over New York City. In 2014 she wrote her own show, <i>Slam Up, </i>which had over 100 performances across the US &amp; Canada. </p>
<p>Our first collaboration together was a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evZdd2UpGWc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">music video</a> for Emily's performance project. We bonded over how much we each enjoy storytelling in our respective mediums.

<p><u><strong>Introduction</strong></u></p>
<p>Unhinged is a five-episode web series being developed and filmed by students at Western Carolina University as apart of our Senior Thesis Showcase. The series follows a reporter and her camera man as she goes into the field to uncover the secrets behind a local cult. We are beyond excited to get this project off the ground, and our wonderful crew has been hard at work refining the scripts and preparing for production with an ambitious attitude. One of our most ambitious goals is to create this web series with the environmental impact in mind, something we are calling the Green Initiative. Along with these things comes the financial cost that will be required to bring this show to life the way we believe it should be. That’s where you come in! We are asking for donations to help us achieve our goals and create the best web series we possibly can.</p>
<p><u><strong>The Crew</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Logan Pitaccio – Showrunner</strong></p>
<p>Logan Pitaccio is a senior at Western Carolina University. He’s an active writer, director, and editor in the Stage &amp; Screen Program. He’s found mild success in all categories, having written five completed short films with two more in pre-production. He was awarded the Best Screenwriter award at the 2019 Controlled Chaos Film Festival for his short screenplay “The House That Clowns Built.” He is beyond excited for the opportunity to show-run and is confident that the audience will love what we have in store for them. He’s from Fayetteville, North Carolina.</p>
<p><strong>Hailey Suzanne Smith – Producer/Production Designer</strong></p>
<p>My name is Hailey Suzanne Smith and I am a third year filmmaking student at Western Carolina University. My concentrations as a filmmaker are in producing and production designing, both of which I am putting into practice with Unhinged. I am also passionate about environmentally-conscious producing and Unhinged will be my first green film project. I am unbelievably excited to be working on this show with such as amazing cast and crew!</p>
<p><strong>Zach Field – Lead Director</strong></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Zachary Field and I’m a student filmmaker here at Western Carolina University in his Senior year. I am the series director which means I’m in charge of keeping the episodes consistent in both look and feel by working hand in hand with the show runner, producers, and episode directors. I’m more than excited to have the opportunity to make this web series and to be able to work with such a strong team.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Koziel – Director</strong></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Ben Koziel and I am a Junior in Western Carolina University’s Film and Television Production program. I am an episode director for Unhinged as well as a member of the writer’s room. I am thrilled to be on a team with such talented members to create a series that I think is a real winner. If you like cults and comedy as much as me, this is the show for you. </p>
<p><strong>Isaac Dye – Director of Photography</strong></p>
<p>Hi! My name is Isaac Dye and I am a third year film student here at WCU. As the Director of Photography, I will be working closely with the Showrunner, Director, and Production Designer to determine the specific visual style and overall look of the series. It will be my job to ensure that all artistic and technical decisions related to the image are executed successfully. I can't wait to begin production on this series and am more than excited to work with such a strong team!</p>
<p><u><strong>The Story</strong></u></p>
<p>Living with a cult for a week might not be everyone’s idea of a perfect vacation, but for Jennifer Wallace, it’s just another normal day on the job. Welcome to Unhinged, the Web Series where we follow investigative reporter Jennifer and her trusty camera-man, Steve Cobble, as they dive into the lives of a local cult and their beloved leader, Julian Caesar. Julian leads the Family Of Cardea, a small convent that dedicates their lives to the worship of Cardea, the Roman (and real) Goddess of door hinges. Jennifer and Steve document the cult on what they believe is their last week before The Unhinging, an apocalyptic event where Cardea will “unhinge” the door of reality and destroy all of creation. But is everything truly what it seems? Is Jennifer in over her head? That might just be for us to know and you to find out.</p>
<p><u><strong>What We Need</strong></u></p>
<p>We are asking for 2,000 dollars to help create this world. This will not cover everything, but it will help us get our most essential needs. We will use these funds to create costumes and props, feed our cast and crew, commit to our Green Initiative, build/decorate our sets, and pay our actors. All of these categories will greatly affect the quality of our final products, and as such, every single dollar counts.</p>
<p><u><strong>The Green Initiative</strong></u></p>
<p>The Green Initiative is an eco-friendly filmmaking initiative never before seen at Western Carolina University. In light of the more recent updates with climate change, the crew feels that it is imperative that we understand the environmental impacts of our industry and combat them as best we can as student filmmakers. With this initiative, several departments of the production team (writers and directors, camera team, sound team, and craft services) will be responsible for a different set of sustainable incentives that will carry throughout the preproduction and production processes.</p>
<p>Directors, writers, and producers of “Unhinged” are responsible for reducing as much paper as possible from the preproduction and production phases of the project. documents such as cast and crew contracts, location agreements, tech scouting checklists, script drafts, script breakdowns, and call sheets will be virtualized. Documents requiring signatures will be signed via an iPad and documents that need to be shared with multiple crew members or professors will be distributed electronically. The Director of Photography will be responsible for holding the camera and lighting teams accountable for drawing as little power from our shooting locations as possible through the use of LED lights and reusable batteries.</p>
<p>The sound department will be responsible for using reusable batteries to power the sound mixer and wireless microphones. They will also fill out sound reports virtually on a simultaneously editable document that will also be accessed by the 2nd AC to input camera notes, streamlining the editor’s creation of the assembly cut.</p>
<p>Lastly, the craft services department will be responsible for eliminating plastic water bottle use on set, providing biodegradable plates and cutlery for shooting days, setting up recycling stations on set, providing vegetarian and vegan snack selections for the cast and crew, and collecting trash that will be composted for the local community gardens. If possible, we would love to have a completely waste-free craft services.</p>
<p>Currently, we are a paperless production and are optimistically preparing for other initiatives that will be put into effect later. We are all happily working hard to find the coexistence between resourceful filmmaking and effective storytelling and with luck, moving forward.</p>

<p>Hello! We are Kaitlyn Krieg and Nicole Lee, creators and writers of a web series about two LGBTQIA women - Kait and Nic. One of the things that frustrates us as consumers of contemporary film and television is a persistent lack of diversity, an absence of people who look and feel like us. While diversity and positive representation of LGBTQIA have improved on screen, there is still progress to be made. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The creation of Kait &amp; Nic is our contribution to improving diversity and positive representation. Kait and Nic are three dimensional characters. Kait battles depression and anxiety while Nic faces racial prejudice. While Kait is introverted, Nic is extroverted. They struggle, dream, and persevere. They are people like you. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are both trained in improv comedy, but we are not professional comedians, writers, or actors. This is our first project together and we are looking for your help to finance and bring it to fruition. All funds raised will be used to pay for the work of our crew (our DOP (director of photography), sound, lighting, editing, makeup), principal cast, and catering. Filming is scheduled for March, 2018 and we are excited to offer some fun perks to help thank you for your support. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are committed to diversity, and casting it in all of its facets. Our cast will be predominantly female, LGBTQIA, and people of color. We will also cast for diversity of age and body type. In supporting Kait &amp; Nic, you will be supporting diversity and its representation in media.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank for your consideration. </p>

Wray’s good friend, Jack Moore (Nathan Fillion) starred in the series and has gone on to become a major movie star. While Jack enjoys the life of an A-lister, Wray tours the sci-fi circuit as a guest of conventions, comic book stores, and lots of pop culture events.  The show will feature all the weird and crazy things that happen to Wray along the way to these events.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1282288/files/20150309181211-Con_Man_Poster-new.jpg?1425949931"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The series is a light-hearted take on the personalities, luminaries, and characters in the sci­fi community we are privileged to call ourselves members. Con Man is a way to share some of the surreal occurrences we have had, while telling the story of a guy learning to love and embrace his fans. </p><p>I wanted to make a show that featured all of my favorite convention artists and friends together. Not only that, I wanted to celebrate the world where heroes, villains, zombie hunters, and space pirates all overlap. I especially wanted to work with my friend Nathan Fillion again.<br/></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1269313/files/20150304161427-why-indiegogo.png?1425514467"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We are seeking funding for the first three episodes of the series. So why are we here on Indiegogo and not debuting this on a more traditional network or outlet?<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p><p>The convention world is unique and not easily understood from the outside. To tell this story right, you need to have first hand experience. Although, to tell this story for more than cable access production values you need a partner. In show business, a network/studio could add plenty to the business of Con Man, but at the expense of the show. Complications such as dictating what guests we may have, changing the tone of the show, going into production freezes, having a delayed release, or forcing the show to only be described by a tagline like “Extras meets Galaxy Quest,” ­ though we will admit that is sort of an on the nose description.</p><p>The most important reason to use Indiegogo is that we have genuinely passionate, stalwart and powerful fans. We’ve even seen fans get movies made. We realized pretty quickly we ought to cut out the middle management and just get you involved as soon as possible. We’ll have more fun having you on board this early in the process, and we know you’d love to see what we’re up to along the way. Not to mention, sci-fi conventions wouldn’t exist without you. You built this world but you’ve only seen one half of it. You know the carnival, let us introduce you to the carnies. </p><h3></h3><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1275029/files/20150306191325-Be_Involved.png?1425698005"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>I would like to direct your attention to the giant wall of rewards to the right with dollar amounts attached. The rewards are great, but more than that, every dollar you spend goes to creating the world of Con Man.</p><p>Want examples? $5? You just bought some sharpies for signing. $10? You bought fruit for the fruit basket that gets stolen from Wray in episode 2. $100? You just bought the furry costume head of a Vardak Warrior worn by  Nigel Thrice, the ""second best motion capture artist."" $1000? You just rented Nathan’s character some skis and bought the fake snow that will stick to his wavy locks.</p><p>If you can’t support us with dollars then your enthusiasm and support is equally valuable - tweet, Facebook, tumblr, Linkedin, Mypace, Friendster, and ICQ the project as much as you can. Don’t be afraid to use morse code or smoke signals. Talk about it with friends and associates at work, comic shops, dog parks, and all secret or not-so-secret gatherings. Spreading the word about the campaign is just as important! We’re so thankful for any support you can offer during our campaign. </p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1269316/files/20150304161549-hotdamn.png?1425514549"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The number may seem like a lot for initial three episodes, but the production costs are high and the series is demanding.

<p>The series is taping over the majority of this June in the Los Angeles, CA area.

</div></div>","Con Man - Teaser. Enjoy!








Wray Nerely (Alan Tudyk-Me!) was a co-star on Spectrum, a sci-fi series which was canceled -Too Soon- yet became a cult classic. Wray’s good friend, Jack Moore (Nathan Fillion) starred in the series and has gone on to become a major movie star. While Jack enjoys the life of an A-lister, Wray tours the sci-fi circuit as a guest of conventions, comic book stores, and lots of pop culture events.  The show will feature all the weird and crazy things that happen to Wray along the way to these events.The series is a light-hearted take on the personalities, luminaries, and characters in the sci­fi community we are privileged to call ourselves members. Con Man is a way to share some of the surreal occurrences we have had, while telling the story of a guy learning to love and embrace his fans. I wanted to make a show that featured all of my favorite convention artists and friends together. Not only that, I wanted to celebrate the world where heroes, villains, zombie hunters, and space pirates all overlap. I especially wanted to work with my friend Nathan Fillion again.We are seeking funding for the first three episodes of the series. So why are we here on Indiegogo and not debuting this on a more traditional network or outlet? The convention world is unique and not easily understood from the outside. To tell this story right, you need to have first hand experience. Although, to tell this story for more than cable access production values you need a partner. In show business, a network/studio could add plenty to the business of Con Man, but at the expense of the show. Complications such as dictating what guests we may have, changing the tone of the show, going into production freezes, having a delayed release, or forcing the show to only be described by a tagline like “Extras meets Galaxy Quest,” ­ though we will admit that is sort of an on the nose description.The most important reason to use Indiegogo is that we have genuinely passionate, stalwart and powerful fans. We’ve even seen fans get movies made. We realized pretty quickly we ought to cut out the middle management and just get you involved as soon as possible. We’ll have more fun having you on board this early in the process, and we know you’d love to see what we’re up to along the way. Not to mention, sci-fi conventions wouldn’t exist without you. You built this world but you’ve only seen one half of it. You know the carnival, let us introduce you to the carnies. I would like to direct your attention to the giant wall of rewards to the right with dollar amounts attached. The rewards are great, but more than that, every dollar you spend goes to creating the world of Con Man.Want examples? $5? You just bought some sharpies for signing. $10? You bought fruit for the fruit basket that gets stolen from Wray in episode 2. $100? You just bought the furry costume head of a Vardak Warrior worn by  Nigel Thrice, the ""second best motion capture artist."" $1000? You just rented Nathan’s character some skis and bought the fake snow that will stick to his wavy locks.If you can’t support us with dollars then your enthusiasm and support is equally valuable - tweet, Facebook, tumblr, Linkedin, Mypace, Friendster, and ICQ the project as much as you can. Don’t be afraid to use morse code or smoke signals. Talk about it with friends and associates at work, comic shops, dog parks, and all secret or not-so-secret gatherings. Spreading the word about the campaign is just as important! We’re so thankful for any support you can offer during our campaign. The number may seem like a lot for initial three episodes, but the production costs are high and the series is demanding. This isn’t a living room sitcom; we need to put on a fake convention. Or two. We also need to build a spaceship. It’s a big cast and our friends from the sci-fi community will be joining us. That means at LEAST paying SAG minimums or they wouldn’t be allowed to show.Rewards! Loot! Plunder! Booty! Treasure! I should probably tell you about them as we’ve teamed up with some amazing people who also love the idea of Con Man. In their amazingness they are helping bring Con Man and exclusive offers to you our amazing fans who are likely to be amazed.Instead of just a standard backer blog where we post updates and a few still photos, we’ve teamed up with HANG W/ to provide live (and archived) on-set and behind the scenes content to applicable backers. Some contributors will even get to sit in on exclusive or private Hang W/ times with myself or Nathan. Hang w/ allows myself and Nathan, producer PJ Haarsma, and the cast and crew of Con Man to share exclusive behind the scenes experiences - LIVE from our phones to yours! You even get to chat LIVE with us right through the app. We'll also archive these so you can catch up an anything you missed! While doing blog posts are great, we really love the idea of being able to share stuff on a schedule or off the cuff with fans, rather than waiting till something has happened and typing up a post and editing photos. You can get started now - download the app to your iPhone, iPad or Android Device and follow AlanTudyk, NathanFillion, PJHaarsma and ConMan.Secondly - Thanks to Indiegogo's partnership with Vimeo, we're able to offer the episodes in hi-def streaming to funders who pledge $25+! Not only will you get early access to the episodes before the public, you'll also get to stream them as much as you want for 90 Days. The series will feature English Closed Captioning and subtitles in additional languages as voted on by you, the funders!That's all the episodes, whether we produce 3 episodes or 3,000*! *=Or Twelve.As for the physical rewards, we’ve got a mix of Con Man and SPECTRUM rewards. Spectrum is the space show within-the-show. We have some one time posters and  memorabilia that won’t be available outside the campaign. Some of them are even signed by Jack Moore and Wray Nerely, whose signatures look surprisingly similar to Nathan’s and mine.






We’re excited to make this series, and have a lot planned. But, ultimately Nathan and I just wanted to say thank you. Your support is the inspiration behind this story we want to tell.  Like most things in the convention world, it wouldn’t exist without you. Thank you.

<p>Well...it's a cross between our Standard Blu-Ray set and...a BOOK. The disc content is the exact same, but the packaging is what sets this set apart. It has within the set a <strong>20 page book</strong> attached to the packaging. The pages within the book will contain:</p>
<ol></ol>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>YOUR NAMES</strong>! Anyone who pre-orders this Digi-book will have their name printed within the pages in the list of contributors! </li>
<li>A <strong>handwritten personalized</strong> ""thank you"" and<strong> note</strong> from one of the member of the crew. Might be Jay, Melvor, Billy, or even Dodongo..(there is no telling what we will say ). Each note will be specifically written for <strong>YOU</strong> in your specific copy of the Digi-book. So each Digi-Book will be unique. </li>
<li>
<strong>Art work</strong> from the episodes of season 4</li>
<li>
<strong>Stories</strong> and quotes from the crew</li>
<li>
<strong>special, exclusive, secret pics</strong>....just for you</li>
<li>A old style hand drawn <strong>map</strong> of our season 4 travels (if space is available) </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>This digi-book is ONLY available here and will NEVER be printed again. Ever!</strong></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why does the Digi-Book cost $75 dollars?</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Yes the digi-book is quite a bit more than the standard packaging. Is this what we would want to sell it for if we had a choice? NO, but our hands are tied do to the extreme costs of manufacturing these in such small numbers. For those who don't know, when you get something manufactured (in this case a Digi-book) the more you order the lower the cost will be per unit. In other words, if we had 2,000 of these made the costs to get them made would be way cheaper, and we could charge 30-40 instead. But unfortunately we are not Sony or a big company that can just go get thousands made and sell them much cheaper, we are just a couple of chodes. Therefore these will cost us about 50-60 bucks each to get made since we are only going to get 100-200 made. (maybe even less). If we make more than 200 our costs will go down some and we do something special for everyone who purchased one as a thank you. Our profit margin will be about the same on this as the regular set, we just wanted to give some of our fans an option for something special. </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>UPDATE</strong></h2>
<p><strong>We hit the 200+ sold threshold on the digi-books, making the manufacturing costs a little cheaper,  which means the books will now increase from 12 pages to 20!</strong></p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is John ""Oz"" Layne. </p>
<p>I'm no Chef but I am known for Educating people about Health through Food and so much more.  I LOVE seeing people get healthy while enjoying the Foods they love. </p>
<p>This Show is important to me because I know that you can be healed through food and that there are a very large number of Urban Chefs, Restaurants, and Farms that help people to do that.   The Chefs and Owners of these establishments usually do not receive the attention and recognition of the Food Community as a whole.</p>
<p>Your Contribution will help those who LOVE to watch Food Shows but don't receive the knowledge they need to become healthy beings, get, through entertainment, the education so badly needed.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To shoot this show, we need $6,400.  The funds are to pay for a Video Transmitter which is used for the Director to see the shots as they occur.  That costs approximately $1200.00.  We also need to cover the cost of travel (Local) for the crew.  This is for Fuel.  We also have to feed the Crew.  Everyone has Volunteered for this project due to its' impact potential and I personally cannot allow them to put in so much work without pay AND Food. </p>
<p>We Appreciate your support immensely!  We want to Thank You by offering the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support of $50 - $100 will receive their name in the credits of the show and a Listing on our Website as a Supporter.</li>
<li>Support of $101 - $500 will receive the above PLUS the opportunity to be on an Episode as a Featured Patron (restaurant or farm of their choosing from our list of Featured Guests).</li>
<li>Support of $501 - $1000 will get both of the above but with the choice of 2 Episodes AND  a Great Urban Eats™ T-Shirt.</li>
<li>Support of $1000+ will receive all of the above PLUS a Guest  Co-Host Spot on an Episode.  If we do not reach our goal, the received funds will be distributed as such; 1st - Towards the Transmitter we need to shoot the show.  2nd - Towards Feeding the Crew. And 3rd - Towards travel expenses for the Crew.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As we've stated previously, this show is a Game Changer!  So many people will finally have an outlet that not only Entertains them but also Educates them on the importance and relativity of Food in their lives.  From this, they will be able to make healthy decisions on Food choices while celebrating the Amazing People who bring it to them.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
My name is John ""Oz"" Layne. 
I'm no Chef but I am known for Educating people about Health through Food and so much more.  I LOVE seeing people get healthy while enjoying the Foods they love. 
This Show is important to me because I know that you can be healed through food and that there are a very large number of Urban Chefs, Restaurants, and Farms that help people to do that.   The Chefs and Owners of these establishments usually do not receive the attention and recognition of the Food Community as a whole.
Your Contribution will help those who LOVE to watch Food Shows but don't receive the knowledge they need to become healthy beings, get, through entertainment, the education so badly needed.
 

What We Need & What You Get
To shoot this show, we need $6,400.  The funds are to pay for a Video Transmitter which is used for the Director to see the shots as they occur.  That costs approximately $1200.00.  We also need to cover the cost of travel (Local) for the crew.  This is for Fuel.  We also have to feed the Crew.  Everyone has Volunteered for this project due to its' impact potential and I personally cannot allow them to put in so much work without pay AND Food. 
We Appreciate your support immensely!  We want to Thank You by offering the following:

Support of $50 - $100 will receive their name in the credits of the show and a Listing on our Website as a Supporter.
Support of $101 - $500 will receive the above PLUS the opportunity to be on an Episode as a Featured Patron (restaurant or farm of their choosing from our list of Featured Guests).
Support of $501 - $1000 will get both of the above but with the choice of 2 Episodes AND  a Great Urban Eats™ T-Shirt.
Support of $1000+ will receive all of the above PLUS a Guest  Co-Host Spot on an Episode.  If we do not reach our goal, the received funds will be distributed as such; 1st - Towards the Transmitter we need to shoot the show.  2nd - Towards Feeding the Crew. And 3rd - Towards travel expenses for the Crew.


The Impact
As we've stated previously, this show is a Game Changer!  So many people will finally have an outlet that not only Entertains them but also Educates them on the importance and relativity of Food in their lives.  From this, they will be able to make healthy decisions on Food choices while celebrating the Amazing People who bring it to them.
I'm sure you, somewhere along your life's journey, have watched the various Food Shows and said something like ""that's a heart attack on a bun"" or ""Looks good!  I want that!!"".  this show will serve to satisfy those needs while saying, ""Here is an alternative to what you just saw if you have, for example, Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Food Allergies, etc."".

Risks & Challenges
The only potential hurdles that we foresee with this project is getting a major distributor to buy in.  However, due to our Team of Producers and Executive Producers, we actually have the contacts within who are connected to these Majors and therefore, have a much higher rate of success potential than the average Producer of a Television Project.  
We will utilize these connections (some of who have already been securely briefed) to our advantage.  In fact, all that we need to do is shoot it and present it.  We strongly believe we have a greater than 80% chance of being green lighted.

<h3>The 'boonies' Mission</h3>
<p>We need to help our community grow with intention by inspiring people to start their own cool business and help the economy thrive. By spotlighting some of the many individuals who have put down roots here and started the kinds of businesses that make our town the thriving community it is today, we hope to be part of the effort to attract more unique, sustainably-minded, and forward-thinking entrepreneurs to the area. The ‘boonies’ series will illuminate the very best of our town and region, and we believe it can play a role in helping the area chart a positive and enduring course for the future.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise enough money to produce a five minute episode of 'boonies.' Each episode will focus on a business owner or entrepreneur in the area while also featuring other businesses and landmarks around the High Country.</p>
<p>We hope to produce six episodes for the first season. So far we only have the funding to produce three. That's why we NEED your help!! Each episode costs at least $12k to produce, but if we reach our goal please don't stop donating! The more money we raise the more episodes of 'boonies' we can produce.</p>
<p>If the campaign is successful and we're able to complete the first season of 'boonies,' we'll put it online for viewers to stream for free. We've also had interest from UNC-TV (North Carolina's Public Television station), so television broadcast is a possibility for the future. But we can't make that happen without your continued support!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It takes $12k to produce each episode of ‘boonies.’ To produce all six episodes for the first season we'll need $72k. So far we've raised $25k (The Watauga Economic Development Commission has contributed $20k and First Security Insurance has contributed $5k) but the rest is coming straight from our pocket, which is why we need this campaign to be successful!</p>
<p>Our budget goes toward costs for crew, video equipment, travel, food, supplies, post production and promotion. Our budget is based on public television day rates for the crew &amp; expenses which means we are economical and fair — and about half of what commercial outfits charge. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We need to help our community grow with intention by inspiring similar people to start their own cool business and help the economy thrive. <i>*The Appalachian region has some of the most poverty stricken counties in the country. 40% of Watauga County school children receive free/reduced lunches. We can help fix this with robust and mindful industry!</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Perks!</h3>
<p>Now to tell you about some of our very special perks. Several businesses around town have been generous enough to donate perks to our campaign. We want to thank them all again for their continued support and for demonstrating what 'boonies' is all about!</p>
<p>For a donation of $500 our friends from Startup High Country will give you business advice based on your specific needs! They'll have two one-hour meetings with you, the first an initial discovery session and the second with an expert to go over your specific needs. The mission of Startup High Country is to create more high-tech &amp; high-paying jobs in the High Country. </p>
<p>For $1,000 you'll receive a night at the new Horton Hotel located in historic downtown Boone. The Horton is currently under construction but projected to open in Fall 2018. It'll be Boone’s first boutique hotel, complete with a rooftop lounge with breathtaking views of downtown, Appalachian State University’s campus, and surrounding mountains. You’ll also get two tickets for a Pubcycle tour (we've done it and trust us, you'll have a great time!) and dinner on us.</p>

<h3><strong><i>Plot Device</i> Synopsis </strong></h3>
<p>Andy is down in the dumps. He’s unemployed, recovering from a family tragedy, and struggling to save his marriage. His life is turned upside-down when a mysterious button with the power to bend reality unexpectedly arrives at his doorstep.</p>
<p>With every press of the button, Andy finds zany characters, classic story tropes, and wild adventure thrust into his formerly underwhelming life.

<h3><strong>About Us</strong></h3>
<p>Perfectly Adequate Films is a media production company founded by Erinn Nelson and William Douglas Turner. Both aspiring actors and writers, the two met working the same job in NYC, and quickly developed a habit of pitching each other silly story premises and movie concepts.</p>
<p>Since then, Will and Erinn have written, directed, produced and starred in nearly a dozen sketches and short films, and have been featured in such festivals as The NYC Short Film Comedy Film Festival and The NYC Independent Film Festival. The duo also capitalized on their comedy chemistry by becoming co-hosts for various live events, including a stint as the game show hosts for the app Hangtime from  2017-2019.</p>
<p><i>Plot Device</i>, an original TV series pitch, was conceived out of a mutual love for genre-style storytelling, however, it did not truly come together until Will and Erinn received a call from award-winning filmmaker Beecher Reuning, who was interested in a collaboration. He loved the idea of <i>Plot Device</i>, so the three wrote a treatment for the pilot script.</p>
<p>Since then, so much has changed. <i>Plot Device</i> has survived a pandemic, two table reads and countless editing sessions. What remains is a tight script, with an insanely talented cast and creative team, chomping at the bit to start filming. </p>
<p>That's where you come in. </p>
<p>It’s time for you to join our team</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need </strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Independent filmmaking requires creativity, hard work, perseverance, and no small amount of generosity. Perfectly Adequate Films is hoping to raise at least $5,000 to help aid in the creation of this television pilot.  Production is set to begin July of 2021, and these funds will help pay for a secure (and ideal) location to film, allow PAF to engage, feed, and pay a top-notch crew, and keep all on-set personnel safe with strict Covid protocols and personal protective equipment. </p>
<p>No donation is too small! Wonder how your $15 could possibly help ? Here is a breakdown of what your contribution could cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>$15 - covers one day's worth of on-set coffee (<i>very</i> important)</li>
<li>$25 - supplies 1 box of KN95 masks</li>
<li>$50 - funds a day of filming with one of our talented Actors</li>
<li>$75 - pays for the official <i>Plot Device </i>prop button</li>
<li>$100 - allows us to house a crew/cast member for one night</li>

<p>We are members of the Austin comedy group, Say Uncle. ‘The Say’ began as a live, late-night hour-long show in a grungy basement theater in Austin, Texas. It ran for a year before we decided to expand our favorite parts of the live show into a narrative digital series. The show was built over a shared bond of playing vulgar, chaotic, and over-the-top female characters. Working on the show has strengthened the creative trust we have in each other and encouraged us to keep on bitchin’.</p>

It ran for a year before we decided to expand our favorite parts of the live show into a narrative digital series. The show was built over a shared bond of playing vulgar, chaotic, and over-the-top female characters. Working on the show has strengthened the creative trust we have in each other and encouraged us to keep on bitchin’.

<p>My Name is Faye Alamango the creator and producer of a startup web Movie series called Gypsy &amp; The Devil. The web series has been widely viewed online via Youtube and Facebook. This series that I have dedicated myself too, has so far, two first episodes. second one having a more solid and serious approach in establishing what is hopefully to become a long running program. We are looking to raise money in order to continue with the series.</p>
<p>From the beginning it all started when I had asked a friend of mine to do a documentary about my tarot reading business ''Fire &amp; Moon Dust Mystical Emporium''. I am a professional tarot reader, who works in similar manner to a psychologist / therapist, only I use tarot cards to assist my clients in therapy and guidance. </p>

<h3>WHAT IS ""VOLUNTEERS"" ABOUT?</h3>
<p>Vince hasn’t had an audition in 13 months but, with the help of his wife, has decided to look at his situation in a new way. It’s not that he can’t find work… it’s that he’s been retired for a year and just didn’t know it.  With this new found realization, he needs a purpose, so he decides to search for meaning by visiting his old friend Matt in Rwanda where he runs a charity for orphans.</p>
<p>Video of Erik punching a Trump supporter at a protest march ends up on FOX News with the host noting “For those of you wondering where that guy from ER has been these past years… we found him.” And after experiencing a bit of a “Hatfields and McCoys” situation with his neighbor that tests his anger issues, he could probably use a time-out of his own. When he hears of Vince’s plan to “do good” with “the black kids” in Rwanda, Erik quickly turns it into a “guys trip” and invites himself along... much to the consternation of Vince.</p>
<p>In the vein of HBO’s Curb Your Enthusiasm and FX’s Louie, Volunteers takes it a step further by putting  Vince and Erik in darkly-comedic situations that unflinchingly expose them to the horrors of genocide, the scourge of the AIDS epidemic, the vicious cycle of poverty in developing nations, and the self-aggrandizing of many in the world of International NGOs and Charities.</p>
<h3>WHY IS ""VOLUNTEERS"" DIFFERENT?</h3>
<p>Beyond making a funny, fish-out -of-water comedy, the idea is to show a side of Africa, and Rwanda in particular, that has rarely been seen by a western audience. A vibrant, bustling, and yes, funny place filled with unique characters. After completion of the pilot the production team and its representatives will take the show around Hollywood and pitch it as a series.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488133841/xuxudma0c30cdstjrn6z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>HOW DOES ""VOLUNTEERS"" GIVES BACK?</h3>
<p>With the exception of Erik and Vincent (and Matt, sort of), the cast will be entirely Rwandan, as will the crew. The money raised from this campaign will go towards a five day shoot that will employ local Rwandans in all departments including camera, wardrobe, hair &amp; makeup, sound, lighting, grip, locations, transportation, catering, and support staff.</p>
<p>We are excited to be able to expose American audiences to some of these incredibly talented actors and artists.</p>
<p>Additionally, 10% of the the money raised here will be donated to the Rwandan charity <a href=""http://www.wearelimitless.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We Are Limitless</a> and their efforts to place orphans in boarding schools and provide them with quality healthcare. The production team has also agreed to donate 10% of any profits made from the potential Volunteers series to the charity.</p>
<h3>WHAT'S SO COOL ABOUT THESE PERKS?</h3>
<p> EVERY contribution above $25 will receive a password to stream the 30 minute pilot.</p>
<p>We are also offering a bunch of other cool perks for your contributions.  From personalized tweets from the actors, to Skype sessions on set with the cast and crew in Rwanda.</p>
<p>How about joining the cast and playing the role of a lifetime? -- ""The Guy That Got Punched By Erik."" For a couple of bucks more, he'll let you punch him back.</p>
<p>Come hang out with the filmmakers and cast at the Los Angeles premiere.</p>
<p>Ever want to be an Executive Producer? Get the full ""Hollywood treatment"" and come to Rwanda while we are filming. Visit the set and even have Matt take you up to see the mountain gorillas or personally drive you on a tour in Akagera National Park where you can see zebras, giraffes, hippos... and if you're lucky you might get chased by an elephant like the last time he took people there.</p>
<h3>WHO ARE THE CREATORS?</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005292/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Erik Palladino</strong></a> has been acting for over 35 years with somewhat mediocre results. But every few years, something pretty good happens, which then fills his tank of hope and keeps him going. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, Erik has starred in some hit shows and movies over the years. Some that people have actually seen, such as ER (Dr. Dave Malluci), U-571 (Mazzola) and Can't Hardly Wait (Cousin Ron). He has also had large recurring roles on SUITS (Kevin Miller) and NCIS:LA (Sabatino). People definitely watch those shows, and as result when Erik is out in the street, some people will think that he went to high school with them.  Erik has had multiple failed shows, some that he was pretty good in too, like, FX's OVER THERE and ABC's 666 PARK AVENUE, along with six failed pilots (he may have been just okay in 2 of the 6) but he is proud to have been in all of them and looks forward to being in more failed things in the future. To his credit, in the face of all this constant failure, he somehow hangs in there by a thread. Erik is very persistent. And like many artists, he decided to try to fail with another art form. For Erik, it's been writing. He has been writing for over ten years with very little to show for it. But in all fairness, this current writing team, came really close to getting a pilot picked up to series a few years back. Real close. They have not collaborated since. It was so close that it in the words of Taylor Swift, it took them ten years to, ""Shake it off."" Now, here we are again. </p>
<p>Erik is hoping that this current project and idea will be ""the one."" Although, most would think, based on his past, that this pilot was just another tap on that illusive glass ceiling for Erik. Some might think it will be another big waste of time, effort and money. Maybe. Most likely. Probably. You'd think, based on the history alone. But if you believe in dreams, like Erik obviously does, come along with him on this journey.  He's taking the bull by the horns, by being the master of his own destiny, he will do everything he can to make this dream of being the creator and star of his own series almost pretty good.  </p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>This campaign is to fund the production of a<strong> <i>Pilot episode of Mommy Mafia</i></strong>. I started writing it when my daughter was a baby. I was amazed at the way people trusted me in public places with their laptops and children just because I was a Mom. And it got me thinking about the perception of moms as being these super responsible trustworthy people and what if moms were to leverage their trustworthiness for their own gain? Wouldn’t that shake things up? The other thing that struck me as a new mom was how quickly I bonded with other moms, We were fast close friends. We waged tight friendships even though we all had very little in common beyond motherhood. Sort of like in war, we needed each other so we became close quickly and those bonds have stayed strong ever since.</p><p>I’m Laura Sweeney, Screenwriter, Director and Actress. My scripts have been semi finalist with Screencraft Script Fund and Nantucket Film Festival. Currently, I have a feature film in development with Aloris Entertainment and previously have had television projects optioned by North South Productions. I've directed a short experimental film called THE NECK and created two webseries: The Mothership and Theater Bitches. I performed most recently in the NYC Fringe Festival award winning play Random Us. Member of SAG-AFTRA, The Georgetown Entertainment Media Alliance, and New York Women In Film and Television. I teach screenwriting for Writers Boot Camp and am a graduate of Georgetown University. I studied acting with the Moscow Art Theatre <a href=""http://www.laurasweeney.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.laurasweeney.com</a></p><p>Mommy Mafia is a story about a new type of family. Groups of moms thrust together out of necessity. Today’s world is so competitive and expensive that moms bond together most their waking hours, to raise the kids and make ends meet. It also is a story about the haves and have-nots. The main character’s arch nemesis, a woman they nickname Yoga Bitch is a different type of mom with a nasty attitude and a designer stroller in tow.</p><p>It’s a really fun project with lots of inherent comedy that takes place in Park Slope, Brooklyn. My vision for the project is a very real grassroots but polished Brooklyn look. I’d like to shoot in all in NY, on the charming stoops, coffee shops and boutiques in Brooklyn. It’d be fun to pay homage to the mafia films by showing the <strong>new mafia of Brooklyn: the moms</strong>. I’m excited especially by these characters. From Ruth, a born leader who forgot to comb her hair to Kira the drummer in a band who is now the mom of twin boys. They are all very brave and adventurous people who dive in head first. These moms are smart edgy and funny.  These moms are real people whole dynamic people who carry great responsibility to hand off their values to their kids. I also always love a story that is the plight of the underdog, the middle class mom who puts her kids first and her ingenuity and smarts beat out the super entitled snobby mommies.</p><p><strong>THE IMPACT OF YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS:</strong></p><p>Your contributions will help us to achieve a professional level pilot and realize this project's full creative potential. We’ll then be able to bring this piece and the rest of the 9 scripted episode, currently being written to Netflix, Hulu, amazon prime and other new media outlets. This piece will act as a blue print for the entire series and open doors for this project.</p><p><strong>HOW MUCH MOOLAH? and FOR WHAT EXACTLY?</strong></p><p><i><u>How much are we raising?</u></i> $10,000</p><p><i><u>Where is it going:</u></i> A 3-4 Day shoot in Brooklyn, NY.</p><ul>

I started writing it when my daughter was a baby. I was amazed at the way people trusted me in public places with their laptops and children just because I was a Mom. And it got me thinking about the perception of moms as being these super responsible trustworthy people and what if moms were to leverage their trustworthiness for their own gain? Wouldn’t that shake things up? The other thing that struck me as a new mom was how quickly I bonded with other moms, We were fast close friends. We waged tight friendships even though we all had very little in common beyond motherhood. Sort of like in war, we needed each other so we became close quickly and those bonds have stayed strong ever since.I’m Laura Sweeney, Screenwriter, Director and Actress. My scripts have been semi finalist with Screencraft Script Fund and Nantucket Film Festival. Currently, I have a feature film in development with Aloris Entertainment and previously have had television projects optioned by North South Productions. I've directed a short experimental film called THE NECK and created two webseries: The Mothership and Theater Bitches. I performed most recently in the NYC Fringe Festival award winning play Random Us. Member of SAG-AFTRA, The Georgetown Entertainment Media Alliance, and New York Women In Film and Television. I teach screenwriting for Writers Boot Camp and am a graduate of Georgetown University. I studied acting with the Moscow Art Theatre www.laurasweeney.comMommy Mafia is a story about a new type of family. Groups of moms thrust together out of necessity. Today’s world is so competitive and expensive that moms bond together most their waking hours, to raise the kids and make ends meet. It also is a story about the haves and have-nots. The main character’s arch nemesis, a woman they nickname Yoga Bitch is a different type of mom with a nasty attitude and a designer stroller in tow.It’s a really fun project with lots of inherent comedy that takes place in Park Slope, Brooklyn. My vision for the project is a very real grassroots but polished Brooklyn look. I’d like to shoot in all in NY, on the charming stoops, coffee shops and boutiques in Brooklyn. It’d be fun to pay homage to the mafia films by showing the new mafia of Brooklyn: the moms. I’m excited especially by these characters. From Ruth, a born leader who forgot to comb her hair to Kira the drummer in a band who is now the mom of twin boys. They are all very brave and adventurous people who dive in head first. These moms are smart edgy and funny.  These moms are real people whole dynamic people who carry great responsibility to hand off their values to their kids. I also always love a story that is the plight of the underdog, the middle class mom who puts her kids first and her ingenuity and smarts beat out the super entitled snobby mommies.THE IMPACT OF YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS:Your contributions will help us to achieve a professional level pilot and realize this project's full creative potential. We’ll then be able to bring this piece and the rest of the 9 scripted episode, currently being written to Netflix, Hulu, amazon prime and other new media outlets. This piece will act as a blue print for the entire series and open doors for this project.HOW MUCH MOOLAH? and FOR WHAT EXACTLY?How much are we raising? $10,000Where is it going: A 3-4 Day shoot in Brooklyn, NY.

<h3>What is <i>Going Both Ways</i>?</h3>It's the story of identical twins who look and sound alike, and even think alike. But they've started moving along different paths. Adam and his wife just moved to the suburbs with an infant and a newborn, and Todd just started dating men.<br/><br/>Both twins are newbies and they're anxious - whether it be about a first diaper change or a first hand job. But they remain deeply committed to each other and their comedy career, and are willing to do whatever it takes to get each other through this new chapter in their lives. <p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why this series? Why Now?</h3>
<p>We're creating ""Going Both Ways"" because these are our lives now. In five years, Todd may fall in love with an elderly Japanese heiress, Baiya Toyota. And Adam may change his gender to compete with his wife for the affections of their son's studly math teacher, Mr. Jason. But for now, this is who we are.<br/><br/>We're also excited about the fact that some of today's biggest comedy shows started as web series, including shows such as ""Broad City,"" ""Insecure,"" and ""Workaholics.""</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where your money will go</h3>

</div></div>","What is Going Both Ways?It's the story of identical twins who look and sound alike, and even think alike. But they've started moving along different paths. Adam and his wife just moved to the suburbs with an infant and a newborn, and Todd just started dating men.Both twins are newbies and they're anxious - whether it be about a first diaper change or a first hand job. But they remain deeply committed to each other and their comedy career, and are willing to do whatever it takes to get each other through this new chapter in their lives.  

Why this series? Why Now?
We're creating ""Going Both Ways"" because these are our lives now. In five years, Todd may fall in love with an elderly Japanese heiress, Baiya Toyota. And Adam may change his gender to compete with his wife for the affections of their son's studly math teacher, Mr. Jason. But for now, this is who we are.We're also excited about the fact that some of today's biggest comedy shows started as web series, including shows such as ""Broad City,"" ""Insecure,"" and ""Workaholics.""

<p>When reality gets grim, make up a better version of it. Or a grimmer one. Or funnier. Something to remind you that things can always be different.</p>
<h3>What's it all about?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534427599/o2itrrgicqjh1cue2jml.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are asking for your help to finish the first season of our web-comedy KANAL 82 – and thus show your support for liberal voices under threat in Turkey today.</p>
<p>KANAL 82 tells the behind-the-scenes-story of a local TV station in a fictional small town in Turkey, mainly broadcasting light entertainment. Having no experience in “serious journalism”, one day the channel‘s exclusively female crew is caught up by a horrific event - too horrible to be mentioned here - which all the big media organs corporations self-censor immediately. Only Kanal 82 broadcasts live and uncut.</p>
<p>The web-series is a running comedic commentary on the distressing and often chaotic twists and turns of recent politics in Turkey, with it's crackdown on free media, leftist political opposition and liberal freedoms. It tackles issues like the aftermath of the failed coup from 07-15-2016, the militarization of Turkey's society and the effect the economical crisis has on the average people.</p>
<p>KANAL 82 is witty, it's critical and it doesn't shy away from talking truth to power. And it is a decidedly feminist series, casting seven strong female leads against the seemingly all-powerful alliance of state authorities, corrupt businessman and a censored press.</p>
<p>The first five episodes of the series have been written, developed &amp; produced over the course of the last 13 months. Spoken language is mostly Turkish, with English and German subtitles.</p>
<p>To finish the first season, we have to shoot two more episodes – and for this we are calling for YOUR support. After a short festival run, the series will be made available online &amp; free around mid 2019.</p>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535209295/iohivwztkahnzzwbucab.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>KANAL 82 is the outgrow of a long history of migration and cultural entanglement. The series is produced in Berlin, Germany - from the midst of the biggest community of <i>Türkiyeli </i>(people from Turkey) outside of Turkey.</p>
<p>Our creative team comprises individuals from all walks of lives, Turkish-Germans born and raised in Berlin, <i>Türkiyeli  </i>who recently arrived for political reasons and Germans.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534968405/xsjycloslufdk40qewa2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We - Zeynep Tuna and Nino Klingler - are the series' writers and directors. Zeynep (born in Eskisehir, Turkey) is a specialist in Turkish popular culture and a digger for the weirdest Found Footage around. Nino (from a small town in Southern Germany) is both a film director and a prolific reviewer, with more than 300 published texts to date (albeit mostly in German).</p>
<p>We met in Istanbul over ten years ago and have since been working on many different projects in many different media together, including experimental found footage on Turkish sexploitation films, a short fiction on gay romance and many more.</p>
<p>Currently, we are fellows at the <a href=""https://www.udk-berlin.de/en/research/graduate-school/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Graduate School</a> of Berlin's University of the Arts - a wonderful program allowing artists to work on a project for two years. With KANAL 82, we got accepted as a team to realize our vision of a fictional TV station somewhere between Turkey and Germany...</p>
<h3>What happened so far...</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534427655/p17wgwq7m4myje2vetyw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Over the last 18 months, we have built a working TV studio in our atelier in the University of Arts - check out this very short <a href=""https://vimeo.com/285600947"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">introduction</a> to the heart of KANAL 82.</p>
<p>We have gathered a wonderful group of people to help us in front &amp; behind the camera - including our marvellously charismatic and talented main actresses.</p>
<p>Over the last year, we grew together as a team, sharing a vision and a political conviction.  We also had to overcome some hardships - especially the unexpected and painful loss of Zeynep Delibalta, a wonderful person and gifted artist who was acting as one of the leading characters in the first two episodes. She is sorely missed. It is in her memory that we continue to work double as hard to finish KANAL 82's first season.</p>
<h3>Just one step away...</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534427687/dayclao28nx7zp4qmag9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Together with our amazing team &amp; crew we poured all our love, energy and commitment into building our set and shooting five episodes of 10-15 min each. We are one week of shooting  away from finishing the first season of KANAL 82. The crew is ready, the set is ready, the equipment is available - but the money has run out. The limited resources provided by our university have all gone into getting as far as we are now.</p>
<p>So we <u>need your help</u> to shoot two more episodes. The largest chunk of the money will go to our amazing team. We do not only love the people we are working with, we respect them. They believe in our project so much that they accept possible risks for themselves and their loved ones. Most of us have family in Turkey, and everybody knows stories about persecuted artists, journalists, activist. But still they work for KANAL 82, in front of and behind the camera.</p>
<p>In our opinion, this kind of commitment deserves recognition. No one can live from passion alone. We live in a capitalist world. People who make art have to be able to support their lives from it, to whatever meager degree. This crowdfunding campaign is for them.</p>
<p>So we call upon you to support KANAL 82, support alternative voices in Turkey, support political diversity - and become a part of a community. If you look at our perks you will see: Your contribution is much more than a financial backing. It's becoming part of KANAL 82's team. It's showing a flag.</p>
<p>See the diagram below for a detailed breakdown of how we want to spend the money. If we do not meet our goal entirely, we will distribute what we have among everybody.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534441897/jmpzt4cq3sinxn1ndbzn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Some words on politics...</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534427747/vuf50qssa3tkcvcajvrk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You've probably heard about it: Turkey is sliding down a vicious spiral of economic, political and social crisis at the moment. There is a war being waged against the Kurdish minority in the country's southeast (and Syria's North), critical voices in the media have in large part been silenced through police persecution and political influence, and the authoritarian prime-minister-turned-president on top (whose name we will never mention) has just fulfilled his masterplan to turn Turkey from a emerging democracy into a one-party, one-person quasi-dictatorship. </p>
<p>The reality looks grim. The lira, the Turkish currency, is rapidly losing value as social unrest is growing between the majority and the many minorities in the country (Kurdish, Alevis, Syrian refugees). But the state-controlled mainstream media have so far succeed in shifting the blame for the country's malaise from its corrupt elites to diverse ""foreign powers"" (Israel, the US, Europe....). Turkey is more and more living in an alternative reality of ever-evolving conspiracy theories, with new villains popping up constantly and ever stranger plot twists happening on a daily basis. One would be tempted to call it the world's most ridiculous soap-opera – if it wasn't so dead serious...</p>
<h3>Why TV?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534969122/ipijjpurdutekllneasw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Television has a large part in establishing this thwarted worldview since it is undeniably the dominant medium in Turkey. The average <i>Türkyeli </i>(Person from Turkey) watches six hours per day (according to the Statistical Institute of Turkey, TÜIK). The result is that “the overwhelming majority of the population in Turkey gets their news not from newspapers, but from television”. (The quote was taken from a - highly recommended - <a href=""https://www.hrw.org/report/2016/12/15/silencing-turkeys-media/governments-deepening-assault-critical-journalism"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">report</a> by Human Rights Watch entitled ""Silencing Turkey's Media"").</p>
<p>And what a kind of news that is: A recent <a href=""http://turkey.mom-rsf.org/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">media monitoring</a> showed that self censorship and sponsored content abound in an environment where media houses are part of diversified conglomerates also dealing in construction, manufacturing and real estate. And one of the biggest investors is the Turkish state. So obviously, bosses who are eying for government contracts have a strong interest in having their news teams show the country's leadership in a positive light.</p>
<p>KANAL 82 boils these issues down to a local level to make them both understandable and funny. It's about series about small channel, owned by a crook who is dealing in newsmaking the way he is dealing in everything else: Only to further his interest. But he hadn't reckoned with the women working for his channel...</p>
<h3>The Trojan Horse of Comedy</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534427856/qj7vufsafcndaqp0x2gb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You know the one about jokes and frogs? Here goes: Explaining jokes is like dissecting a frog. It's ugly and the frog dies. So better don't do it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we think some explanations are in order as to why we chose to treat grim ""-isms"" like sexism, authoritarianism or nationalism in a comedic fashion. One could say: Looking at 100.000+ political prisoners, an economy on the verge of collapse and toxic social hatred, there isn't a lot to laugh about in Turkey today. The country is, like many societies at the moment, politically deeply divided.</p>
<p>So we were asking ourselves the question: How do you address polarizing issues – like what the role of women should be in a predominantly Muslim society, or how journalistic media should cover political issues – without polarizing the already polarized society even further?</p>
<p>And this is where comedy comes in. We love the slapstick of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and also Samuel Beckett. Because everybody can laugh about their jokes. And because the issues at the heart of the jokes are sometimes surprisingly grave: Poverty, loneliness, exploitation.</p>
<p>So we see comedy as something like a Trojan horse: KANAL 82 is deceptively lighthearted in tone, but with serious issues in mind.</p>
<h3>Why Berlin?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534441830/yfwfbxldd1xonuoxpg9x.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For the last decades, Berlin has often been a safe heaven for Turkey's opposition. Groups of politically persecuted people moved here during the political turbulence of the 1970s, after the 1980's coup, during the Kurdish uprising in the 1990s and again now in the wake of the recent anti-democratic transformation of Turkey, especially following the crackdown after the failed coup attempt of 15th July 2016. The exodus of critical journalists, academics and artists, many of whom come to Germany with its big Turkish-speaking diaspora, has been called a “<a href=""http://www.dw.com/en/turkeys-post-coup-brain-drain/a-36482586"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">brain drain</a>” or „<a href=""http://www.taz.de/!5416355/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New Wave</a>“ by the German media. In Berlin, one can find cutting edge thinking about and artistic engagement with contemporary issues of Turkey.</p>
<p>But this is only one side of the coin: In Germany one also encounters strong factions of supporters of the prime-president and his party AKP (in the presidential election of June 2018, 66% of Turkish-German citizens voted for Erdoğan, compared to only 53% in total). These people often rightfully criticize what they perceive as a condescending approach of the West towards their home country.</p>
<p>Berlin, sometimes dubbed „Little Istanbul“ among the Turkish-speaking community, often appears like an unofficial province of Turkey, encapsulating the whole social, cultural and political spectrum of Turkey.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>We know the world of culture, we know Turkey, and we know the combination of both. In other words: We know money can be tight, especially if a project is asking for a contribution in Euro when your local currency is losing value on a two-digit level every day. </p>
<p>So if you can't or won't contribute to our project financially, we understand 100 %. But if you like what we are doing, please know that there are other ways to support us.</p>
<p>It all boils down to this: Spread the word! Let your community know, share our campaign with your friends on- and offline, use the tools of indiegogo. We are thankful for every post, every like and every word-of-mouth-moment. </p>

Having no experience in “serious journalism”, one day the channel‘s exclusively female crew is caught up by a horrific event - too horrible to be mentioned here - which all the big media organs corporations self-censor immediately. Only Kanal 82 broadcasts live and uncut.
The web-series is a running comedic commentary on the distressing and often chaotic twists and turns of recent politics in Turkey, with it's crackdown on free media, leftist political opposition and liberal freedoms. It tackles issues like the aftermath of the failed coup from 07-15-2016, the militarization of Turkey's society and the effect the economical crisis has on the average people.
KANAL 82 is witty, it's critical and it doesn't shy away from talking truth to power. And it is a decidedly feminist series, casting seven strong female leads against the seemingly all-powerful alliance of state authorities, corrupt businessman and a censored press.
The first five episodes of the series have been written, developed & produced over the course of the last 13 months. Spoken language is mostly Turkish, with English and German subtitles.
To finish the first season, we have to shoot two more episodes – and for this we are calling for YOUR support. After a short festival run, the series will be made available online & free around mid 2019.
Who we are

KANAL 82 is the outgrow of a long history of migration and cultural entanglement. The series is produced in Berlin, Germany - from the midst of the biggest community of Türkiyeli (people from Turkey) outside of Turkey.
Our creative team comprises individuals from all walks of lives, Turkish-Germans born and raised in Berlin, Türkiyeli  who recently arrived for political reasons and Germans.

We - Zeynep Tuna and Nino Klingler - are the series' writers and directors. Zeynep (born in Eskisehir, Turkey) is a specialist in Turkish popular culture and a digger for the weirdest Found Footage around. Nino (from a small town in Southern Germany) is both a film director and a prolific reviewer, with more than 300 published texts to date (albeit mostly in German).
We met in Istanbul over ten years ago and have since been working on many different projects in many different media together, including experimental found footage on Turkish sexploitation films, a short fiction on gay romance and many more.
Currently, we are fellows at the Graduate School of Berlin's University of the Arts - a wonderful program allowing artists to work on a project for two years. With KANAL 82, we got accepted as a team to realize our vision of a fictional TV station somewhere between Turkey and Germany...
What happened so far...

Over the last 18 months, we have built a working TV studio in our atelier in the University of Arts - check out this very short introduction to the heart of KANAL 82.
We have gathered a wonderful group of people to help us in front & behind the camera - including our marvellously charismatic and talented main actresses.
Over the last year, we grew together as a team, sharing a vision and a political conviction.  We also had to overcome some hardships - especially the unexpected and painful loss of Zeynep Delibalta, a wonderful person and gifted artist who was acting as one of the leading characters in the first two episodes. She is sorely missed. It is in her memory that we continue to work double as hard to finish KANAL 82's first season.
Just one step away...

Together with our amazing team & crew we poured all our love, energy and commitment into building our set and shooting five episodes of 10-15 min each. We are one week of shooting  away from finishing the first season of KANAL 82. The crew is ready, the set is ready, the equipment is available - but the money has run out. The limited resources provided by our university have all gone into getting as far as we are now.
So we need your help to shoot two more episodes. The largest chunk of the money will go to our amazing team. We do not only love the people we are working with, we respect them. They believe in our project so much that they accept possible risks for themselves and their loved ones. Most of us have family in Turkey, and everybody knows stories about persecuted artists, journalists, activist. But still they work for KANAL 82, in front of and behind the camera.
In our opinion, this kind of commitment deserves recognition. No one can live from passion alone. We live in a capitalist world. People who make art have to be able to support their lives from it, to whatever meager degree. This crowdfunding campaign is for them.
So we call upon you to support KANAL 82, support alternative voices in Turkey, support political diversity - and become a part of a community. If you look at our perks you will see: Your contribution is much more than a financial backing. It's becoming part of KANAL 82's team. It's showing a flag.
See the diagram below for a detailed breakdown of how we want to spend the money. If we do not meet our goal entirely, we will distribute what we have among everybody.

Some words on politics...

You've probably heard about it: Turkey is sliding down a vicious spiral of economic, political and social crisis at the moment. There is a war being waged against the Kurdish minority in the country's southeast (and Syria's North), critical voices in the media have in large part been silenced through police persecution and political influence, and the authoritarian prime-minister-turned-president on top (whose name we will never mention) has just fulfilled his masterplan to turn Turkey from a emerging democracy into a one-party, one-person quasi-dictatorship. 
The reality looks grim. The lira, the Turkish currency, is rapidly losing value as social unrest is growing between the majority and the many minorities in the country (Kurdish, Alevis, Syrian refugees). But the state-controlled mainstream media have so far succeed in shifting the blame for the country's malaise from its corrupt elites to diverse ""foreign powers"" (Israel, the US, Europe....). Turkey is more and more living in an alternative reality of ever-evolving conspiracy theories, with new villains popping up constantly and ever stranger plot twists happening on a daily basis. One would be tempted to call it the world's most ridiculous soap-opera – if it wasn't so dead serious...
Why TV?

Television has a large part in establishing this thwarted worldview since it is undeniably the dominant medium in Turkey. The average Türkyeli (Person from Turkey) watches six hours per day (according to the Statistical Institute of Turkey, TÜIK). The result is that “the overwhelming majority of the population in Turkey gets their news not from newspapers, but from television”. (The quote was taken from a - highly recommended - report by Human Rights Watch entitled ""Silencing Turkey's Media"").
And what a kind of news that is: A recent media monitoring showed that self censorship and sponsored content abound in an environment where media houses are part of diversified conglomerates also dealing in construction, manufacturing and real estate. And one of the biggest investors is the Turkish state. So obviously, bosses who are eying for government contracts have a strong interest in having their news teams show the country's leadership in a positive light.
KANAL 82 boils these issues down to a local level to make them both understandable and funny. It's about series about small channel, owned by a crook who is dealing in newsmaking the way he is dealing in everything else: Only to further his interest. But he hadn't reckoned with the women working for his channel...
The Trojan Horse of Comedy

You know the one about jokes and frogs? Here goes: Explaining jokes is like dissecting a frog. It's ugly and the frog dies. So better don't do it.
Nevertheless, we think some explanations are in order as to why we chose to treat grim ""-isms"" like sexism, authoritarianism or nationalism in a comedic fashion. One could say: Looking at 100.000+ political prisoners, an economy on the verge of collapse and toxic social hatred, there isn't a lot to laugh about in Turkey today. The country is, like many societies at the moment, politically deeply divided.
So we were asking ourselves the question: How do you address polarizing issues – like what the role of women should be in a predominantly Muslim society, or how journalistic media should cover political issues – without polarizing the already polarized society even further?
And this is where comedy comes in. We love the slapstick of Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers and also Samuel Beckett. Because everybody can laugh about their jokes. And because the issues at the heart of the jokes are sometimes surprisingly grave: Poverty, loneliness, exploitation.
So we see comedy as something like a Trojan horse: KANAL 82 is deceptively lighthearted in tone, but with serious issues in mind.
Why Berlin?

For the last decades, Berlin has often been a safe heaven for Turkey's opposition. Groups of politically persecuted people moved here during the political turbulence of the 1970s, after the 1980's coup, during the Kurdish uprising in the 1990s and again now in the wake of the recent anti-democratic transformation of Turkey, especially following the crackdown after the failed coup attempt of 15th July 2016. The exodus of critical journalists, academics and artists, many of whom come to Germany with its big Turkish-speaking diaspora, has been called a “brain drain” or „New Wave“ by the German media. In Berlin, one can find cutting edge thinking about and artistic engagement with contemporary issues of Turkey.
But this is only one side of the coin: In Germany one also encounters strong factions of supporters of the prime-president and his party AKP (in the presidential election of June 2018, 66% of Turkish-German citizens voted for Erdoğan, compared to only 53% in total). These people often rightfully criticize what they perceive as a condescending approach of the West towards their home country.
Berlin, sometimes dubbed „Little Istanbul“ among the Turkish-speaking community, often appears like an unofficial province of Turkey, encapsulating the whole social, cultural and political spectrum of Turkey.

Other Ways You Can Help

We know the world of culture, we know Turkey, and we know the combination of both. In other words: We know money can be tight, especially if a project is asking for a contribution in Euro when your local currency is losing value on a two-digit level every day. 
So if you can't or won't contribute to our project financially, we understand 100 %. But if you like what we are doing, please know that there are other ways to support us.
It all boils down to this: Spread the word! Let your community know, share our campaign with your friends on- and offline, use the tools of indiegogo. We are thankful for every post, every like and every word-of-mouth-moment.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What Do We Want to Do?</h3>
<p>With your help we will not only be able to tackle the next leg of our journey - South America here we come! - with much more confidence, but produce more content for you guys! <strong>Our plan is to install the locker on our own, following the instructions the product comes with</strong>, while recording the entire process and creating two videos you guys can learn from to help you make the diff decision yourselves. </p>

<h3>What Exactly We Need?</h3>
<p><strong>We need AU$ 575 -</strong> the exact amount 4WD Systems quoted us for a Lokka front locker for the Delica delivered to Perth! <strong>Not one cent more!</strong></p>
<p>We'll do all the hard work of installing, filming and editing the videos ourselves!</p>

<h3>What Do We Get?</h3>
<p>The opportunity to drive the rest of the world with front lockers in place!</p>
<p>Those who have been following us would have noticed our recent efforts trying to prepare the Delica for some rough tracks throughout South America. That's why we've just installed a Warn Winch, Airbag Man air suspensions and redone a lot of the bushings and the steering rack!

<h3>What is TV Bootcamp?</h3>
<p>TV Bootcamp is the intermediate TV production class at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. Every fall, students form crews behind 2-4 projects to create a five part webseries. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>About <i>Somnus</i>
</h3>
<p>Having trouble falling or staying asleep? If counting sheep or drinking warm milk doesn't help, call Somnus Sleep Disorder Hotline! <i>Somnus Sleep, Inc</i>. follows Neil, an almost-college graduate, as he navigates adult life, the immediate aftermath of trauma, and finding a purpose in life, all to a backdrop of a slowly unfolding mystery and sleep issues stronger than all the melatonin in the world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Crew</h3>
<p>Like all film and television productions, creating <i>Somnus</i> is a collaborative process, and each crew member plays a vital role in working towards a final product. Students work together throughout the semester to create a series we're all proud of. The <i>Somnus</i> team is made up of multitalented individuals, from a team of writers, directors, producers and more. </p>

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p><i>Frequency: Delirium </i>is an exciting new project for a webisode series. The series is intense, dark and mysterious. </p>
<p><b><u>Background</u></b></p>
<p>My name is Luke Russell and I am currently studying film production as a degree. I have worked on lots of student short films and I am now looking to step up the scale of my productions. By creating this series, I aim to gain more production skills and experience in Directing/Producing/Writing. I am passionate about creating vivid and compelling worlds that really get people hooked, so I look forward to creating this episodic story!</p>
<p>By donating to this project, it will massively help create a strong believable world. There are some incredibly talented people working on this project, from Producers and Production Designers to Cinematographers and Sound Designers. I strongly believe together we can create a great piece of drama. However, having a more substantial budget will help us purchase the locations/props/set design to create a stunning and immersive world. </p>
<p>As a production team, we believe in our world and we are determined to realise it. If you help donate we can use our passion to deliver you with great drama that will have you on the edge of your seat.  </p>

<h3>What We Need...</h3>
<ul><li>Money.</li></ul>
<h3> What For?</h3>
<ul>

<li>Hiring a room in London to hold cast auditions.</li>
<li>Paying travel expenses of the actors involved. </li>
<li>Purchasing props, costume and dressing the set.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you feel you can donate any amount, great or small, you will be rewarded with one of our perks. From the donation of £1 to the full £500 we will reward you with our unique gifts. These gifts range from a credit in the series, to a poster print and even a copy of the script, (once the show has aired)!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goals</h3>
<p>We want to create great drama. We all watch shows like <i>Game of Thrones and Breaking Bad,</i> it is our ambition to create this quality of entertainment. </p>
<p>Previously I have produced a 16mm film project, directed two micro shorts and I'm currently directing another micro short called <i>Dark Fortune.<i> </i></i>By working on these projects I have learnt a great deal and now I'm ready for the next, bigger project...<i>Frequency: Delirium</i>.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>What Is Mars About?</strong></u></h3>
<p>Mars: Interstellar Adventures is a journey of self-discovery, understanding one's place in the universe, and lots and lots of drinking kale smoothies through sepia filters on the totally-not-the-same instafame app. </p>
<p>Mars is a self-absorbed avatar who lives on earth and has found a new passion for being internet famous. What she wants, she gets, and she lives in a bubble without any consequences to her actions...or so she thinks. Unfortunately, the Planetary Society has a certain disdain for Mars, and her public identity makes her vulnerable to attack. However, Mars is by no means helpless. As an avatar, she possesses superhuman strength and various martial combat skills necessary to defend herself. However, she'd just rather go for a cappuccino run and gossip with her friends. In time, Mars will understand her place in the universe and will have to choose her own destiny.</p>
<p>We really wanted to create an epic adventure with some slices of life that holds a mirror to life. So many messages and lessons can be had from Mars and her ways, and we hope our audience can relate to Mars and the supporting cast as we take you across the galaxy in a story too big to tell in just a one-off episode. Coming of age, overcoming fear, and being split between two worlds are just a fraction of the themes we wish to explore with this story. There is a lot of heart in Mars and company, and her story starts here: with you!</p>

<p>One of the ventures that Chad took up when he was a teenager was music. He was in and out of multiple garage bands, playing guitar in all of them and writing music. Now, he wants to take his style and bring it to life in Mars. Music has always been a gigantic part of any show, and Chad wishes to make the very best he can provide given his materials for the show. Mars is a journey unlike any other, and thus the music must represent the various emotions that our hero and supporting casts feels depending on the situation. Anger, fear, joy, determination, these emotions are amplified with the right soundtrack, thus creating an out of this world experience. He plans to use a DAW (digital audio workstation), but still wants to find a way to implement some hard rock guitar into the soundtrack.  </p>
<p><strong>The current music that is playing in the teaser promotional video is not music created by the studio :) With your help, we want to fix that!</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Chad Garza (commonly known as Smoofheigen on Twitch) Creator/Animator/Writer/Voice Actor/Artist/Music Composer</u></strong></p>
<p>Chad has been practicing storytelling since he was a child. One of his first instances of narrative was doing voice acting for his parents and friends. Not soon after, small short stories were being created with his toys in his bedroom and with his friends at school. Growing up watching highly successful cartoons (and still to this day) such as Dragon Ball Z, Batman: The Animated Series and many, many more, Chad soon formed dreams of telling epic stories in his own way. In college, he studied film, and how methodology is such an incredible factor when it comes to telling a story that you and your audience can enjoy and understand. Storytelling is his utmost passion, and something he lives and breathes every day. Now, he is more than excited to bring Mars to audiences and tell an original story of his own, just like the shows he still looks up to to this day. </p>

From being a little kid practicing stand-up comedy with her mom, to performing/directing/writing small little plays that she would perform for the neighborhood kids, to even creating and filming elaborate soap operas with her dolls. Creating things has always been something she loves doing. Throughout the years she's pursued several different art mediums, from wanting to be a dancer, director, comedian, voice actor, writer, even a magician at one point…crazy I know. But throughout all the different things she’s tried, one thing remains the same: she loves entertaining others with stories. Some of her favorite animated shows that helped influence some ideas for Mars would be Avatar: The Last Airbender, Death Note, The Powerpuff Girls, Samurai Jack, and many, many more. </p>

<p>Haley and Chad started dating after they discovered they shared the same vision in careers. Living the dream, they work out of a small office room via parent's house that was graciously given to them. After being together for 2 years, both of them decided it's time to start a studio from the ground up to bring their dreams into reality. Since they are an incredibly small studio of just two people, they utilize one of their greatest superpowers gained via radioactive cosmic rays: resourcefulness. Both people understand their limitations in production, and bring a storytelling medium that is unique and effective as you have seen above. We wish to grow and bring in more people in time, but for now the project suits both of them and their capabilities! </p>

<p>In order for something to be polished the best it can within the studio's capacity, a full time endeavor is the only option. Given our current situation of pursuing freelance work and juggling part time jobs, its almost impossible to give Mars the attention it deserves to become something truly great. This is why we have turned to you and are asking for your help!</p>

<p>The risks are also incredibly important to consider too! Financially, we live paycheck to paycheck at the moment with very little to spare each month. We've devoted our lives to creating art, and our financials show for it unfortunately. However, in order to make the first five episodes as great as it can be, we need your help to buy us some time to ensure that Mars is truly something amazing. We estimate 150+ hours of work to make sure that this gets made right (this isn't just including animation, but also song writing/composing, voice over work and workflow management). The odds are stacked against us, but we know that we can persevere and make the show that you deserve! </p>

<p>Once we receive our funding (after September 18th) we are planning the next 6 months to create the first five episodes for you guys. We predict that Mid March (hey, close to Chad's birthday, March 14th!) will be our estimated completion date for the first half of the season. If we can finish sooner, then great! Hopefully, we can produce an episode once a month at the duration of 5 mins per episode. This includes animation, voice acting, storyboarding, music production, art design and project management. We plan to stick to the schedule we set out, but are also aware of one of our greatest adversaries: life. It gets in the way when it wants to without rhyme or reason. If anything were to happen, we'll keep you updated on social media that we provide in the campaign. Regardless, we plan to conquer life with an iron fist and indomitable will!</p>

We've devoted our lives to creating art, and our financials show for it unfortunately. However, in order to make the first five episodes as great as it can be, we need your help to buy us some time to ensure that Mars is truly something amazing. We estimate 150+ hours of work to make sure that this gets made right (this isn't just including animation, but also song writing/composing, voice over work and workflow management). The odds are stacked against us, but we know that we can persevere and make the show that you deserve! 

Here is what our budget will be divided up into so you know what exactly your funding is going towards:

Once we receive our funding (after September 18th) we are planning the next 6 months to create the first five episodes for you guys. We predict that Mid March (hey, close to Chad's birthday, March 14th!) will be our estimated completion date for the first half of the season. If we can finish sooner, then great! Hopefully, we can produce an episode once a month at the duration of 5 mins per episode. This includes animation, voice acting, storyboarding, music production, art design and project management. We plan to stick to the schedule we set out, but are also aware of one of our greatest adversaries: life. It gets in the way when it wants to without rhyme or reason. If anything were to happen, we'll keep you updated on social media that we provide in the campaign. Regardless, we plan to conquer life with an iron fist and indomitable will!

<h3><i><strong>THE STORY</strong></i></h3>
<p>Jared Henderson, AKA Jah Kobi, is a born and raised African-American who has successfully expatriated (or repatriated) to Ghana, West Africa. It was never his true plan to return to <i>The Land</i> of his ancestors, but his experiences allowed the idea for <i><strong>The Land</strong></i>  to begin and grow in the mind of it's creator, producer and host.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1582380950/hg2dc8yhfsgabbgcsnxm.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/><br/><br/>Jah first visited and fell in love with Ghana in 2012 through a work study opportunity while completing a bachelor's degree in International Studies at North Carolina  A&amp;T SU. In 2014, after graduating university, Jah returned to Ghana to work with an International church organization who were building a TV station where he was brought on board to assist in content creation. When approached to help create original programming, Jah knew already what he wanted to produce.</p>
<p>He created a show called ""Go Ghana"" (links below) <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581506974/woa7dn4ywm4lnerlffx6.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>with the purpose of sharing with the viewers an experience of Ghana similar to his own. Go Ghana gained much success locally and in neighboring African countries, but Jah's vision extended much further then what he was being allowed to do at the time. The pieces seemed to begin to fall perfectly in place for what was to come.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/6O3sRW_8BUE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div>   <div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qq2YEWCbjKk?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0"" style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""></iframe></div><p> </p>
</div>
<p>After finding his now beautiful Ghanaian wife and birthing a wonderful African-born son, all in Ghana, and about 6 beautiful years later, the idea for <i>The Land</i> was finally born. <u>From his dream of sharing his amazing experience of what Africa truly had to offer the world,</u> Jah and his team of amazing artists and technicians, began to create what they believe will shape history and change the world one viewer at a time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i><strong>THE MISSION</strong></i></h3>
<p>It is the year 2020 and globalization, technology and the sheer will of mankind have made the world ""smaller"" in the sense that people can share their cultures and connect in ways that had never been possible in the history of mankind. However, for whatever reason, <strong>Africa is still a mystery for most people in the world</strong>. Many people may think Africa is one big country, or that most people still live in the bush with gorillas, lions,  tigers and... water buffalo. While others are even surprised that there are cars, highways, millionaires and even billionaires in most African countries. <i>The Land</i> wants to blow the minds of people all over the world. </p>
<p><strong><i>The Land</i> aims to do what no one has truly been able to achieve before, bring the wonderment of Africa's past and present into the homes of the world abroad and show how its future may be even brighter. By showing the colorful and rich cultures, complicated and fascinating history and an immeasurable and vast potential, <i>The Land</i> will reshape the image of Africa in the minds of people all over the world.</strong></p>
<p><strong>In every episode of <i>The Land</i></strong>, Jah Kobi will embark on an adventure in a different city or region of Africa (spending most of the first season in Ghana).  Each episode will be themed by a different aspect of African society and culture (History, food, tradition, etc) and Jah will feature the people, places and things associated with those themes (divided by segments). One important segment consistent throughout every episode will be the highlight of an entity (person, business, etc) by which <i>The Land</i> will support directly or act as a liaison to obtain support for. Every episode will tell a story that will be thoughtfully written, planned and produced with sufficient research, care and an unbiased rawness that you can only otherwise get by a visit to <i>The Land</i> yourself. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i><strong>HOW WE CAN DO IT!</strong></i></h3>
</div><div>
<p>We not only want to broadcast to the world what much of Africa can feel, smell, sound and even taste like, but <strong>WE NEED YOU</strong> to be a part of making it happen. <u>Though, for a production of this quality and magnitude, our ultimate goal is to raise <strong>$1.3 million. </strong>We have calculated our <strong>immediate financial needs</strong> at an approximated <strong>$444<i>,000 (budget available upon request)</i>. </strong></u> Our hope is that all our contributors not only help us create the production and accomplish our goals, but more so help us achieve the vision of a world that realizes and appreciates the great continent of Africa. The following are some of the <b>deliverables </b>to help us get there:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to use this fundraiser to jump start the production of the series and produce the first <strong>2 Seasons </strong>as soon as possible for international syndication. </li>
<li>We want to complete the first season of <strong>13</strong><strong> episodes within 9 months of reaching or goal. WE CAN DO IT!</strong>
</li>
<li>We want to make EVERY contributor <strong>an ambassador</strong> for <i>The Land</i> and all its associations through the perks we offer.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581432057/s8pbte4uvo4qbtob5kju.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Perks</strong> include:<i>The Land </i>clothing and accessories, name mentioning in credits, guided trips, access to exclusive content, partnership opportunities and much more!</li>
<li>We will support the communities we feature through the funds raised and deals made throughout the production (more info below in ""<strong>Growing The Land</strong>"")</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><i><strong>THE VISION</strong></i></h3>
</div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581506147/u2nadnofyorl45fe3bvy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As stated before, we envision a world that appreciates the great continent of Africa for what it truly is and realizes the potential of what it can become. We also realize that cannot be done solely through a few seasons of a travel and culture TV production. Nonetheless, we intend it to start with <i>The Land</i>.</p>
<p><strong>We</strong><b> want <i>The Land</i> to ultimately become a platform that helps to launch various businesses, projects and other entities with the purposes of uplifting the many countries of Africa and most of all its people. </b>The show will not only bring to light the sights and sounds of the countries we feature, but more so the heart and soul of the continent. This brings us to one of the most important aspects of our project. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i><strong>GROWING THE LAND</strong></i></h3>
<p>Please don't get confused. This whole fundraiser is about growing <i>The Land</i>... the TV show. However, as a part of our ultimate vision, we want <i>The Land</i> to contribute to the overall growth of Africa, the Mo<strong>the</strong>r<strong>land</strong>, and its people. The following are ways we will support the communities we feature on the show:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every episode will feature and an entity (person, business, etc) who contributes to the overall growth of the content and is in need of support to grow further, by which we will help them obtain. </li>
<li>We will donate a percentage of <i>The Land's</i> earnings to schools, orphanages, rehabilitation centers and more, with the help of its contributors and viewers alike. </li>
<li>All of the employed production team will be persons of the African Diaspora. </li>
<li>We will bring the wonderment of Africa that has been hidden from the world so the future is full of those that look to this great land with hope </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><i>CHALLENGES</i></h3>
<p>Of course there are challenges! To <strong>bring darkness to the light</strong> is not meant to be easy, but where there's a <strong>will </strong>there is always a <strong>way</strong>. We, Jah Kobi and the rest of <i>The Land</i> team, are dedicated to achieving the mission and vision no matter what obstacles stand in our way.</p>
<p>Even if we don't raise a single $1 in this campaign, <strong>we will begin shooting as early as April </strong>to begin obtaining footage for future episodes. Of course, to achieve the goal of 13 episodes in 9 months (26 in 18 months) we will definitely need to raise more funds to expand the team and its resources, but we will continue to work diligently to achieve our vision.</p>
<p><strong>Nonetheless... </strong>we have already gotten started:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have already personally acquired basic equipment to begin acquiring content. </li>
<li>We shot and started post-production for the pilot episode (which will be available for all contributors to view) </li>
<li>We have created a rough production schedule for Q2 2020 which includes concepts, locations, events and people to feature. </li>
</ul>
<p>After we spend much of the first season in Ghana, we plan to begin traveling to various other African countries (like Nigeria, South Africa, Rwanda and many more) that we will continue on in the 2nd season and even further seasons thereafter. Many of these international locations require work visas and permits to shoot there. The time to acquire these documents may prohibit us from being able to shoot there on schedule, but these are issues that the team is experienced and well prepared to handle. </p>
<p>If you have locations suggestions, connections or advice for any international locations, please email the team at thelandtvshow@gmail.com.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><i><strong>NOT ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE $$$</strong>?</i></h3>
<p>No problem! Even if you can't donate money <strong>WE STILL NEED YOU!</strong></p>
<p>Though we have writers and producers that will provide their ideas and visions for the show, we want all of our contributors to be able to positively be a part of the origin and building of <i>The Land</i> and its goals. </p>
<p>We welcome all ideas in regards to <strong>WHAT YOU WANT</strong> to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>style of the show and its segments</li>
<li>events that you might want us to attend and feature</li>
<li>people you would like to get to know</li>
<li>places / locations you want us to visit</li>
</ul>
<p>And if none of the above you can always <strong>SPREAD THE WORD!</strong></p>

The Land aims to do what no one has truly been able to achieve before, bring the wonderment of Africa's past and present into the homes of the world abroad and show how its future may be even brighter. By showing the colorful and rich cultures, complicated and fascinating history and an immeasurable and vast potential, The Land will reshape the image of Africa in the minds of people all over the world.
In every episode of The Land, Jah Kobi will embark on an adventure in a different city or region of Africa (spending most of the first season in Ghana).  Each episode will be themed by a different aspect of African society and culture (History, food, tradition, etc) and Jah will feature the people, places and things associated with those themes (divided by segments). One important segment consistent throughout every episode will be the highlight of an entity (person, business, etc) by which The Land will support directly or act as a liaison to obtain support for. Every episode will tell a story that will be thoughtfully written, planned and produced with sufficient research, care and an unbiased rawness that you can only otherwise get by a visit to The Land yourself. 
 
HOW WE CAN DO IT!

We not only want to broadcast to the world what much of Africa can feel, smell, sound and even taste like, but WE NEED YOU to be a part of making it happen. Though, for a production of this quality and magnitude, our ultimate goal is to raise $1.3 million. We have calculated our immediate financial needs at an approximated $444,000 (budget available upon request).  Our hope is that all our contributors not only help us create the production and accomplish our goals, but more so help us achieve the vision of a world that realizes and appreciates the great continent of Africa. The following are some of the deliverables to help us get there:

We want to use this fundraiser to jump start the production of the series and produce the first 2 Seasons as soon as possible for international syndication. 
We want to complete the first season of 13 episodes within 9 months of reaching or goal. WE CAN DO IT!

We want to make EVERY contributor an ambassador for The Land and all its associations through the perks we offer.


Perks include:The Land clothing and accessories, name mentioning in credits, guided trips, access to exclusive content, partnership opportunities and much more!
We will support the communities we feature through the funds raised and deals made throughout the production (more info below in ""Growing The Land"")

 
THE VISION


As stated before, we envision a world that appreciates the great continent of Africa for what it truly is and realizes the potential of what it can become. We also realize that cannot be done solely through a few seasons of a travel and culture TV production. Nonetheless, we intend it to start with The Land.
We want The Land to ultimately become a platform that helps to launch various businesses, projects and other entities with the purposes of uplifting the many countries of Africa and most of all its people. The show will not only bring to light the sights and sounds of the countries we feature, but more so the heart and soul of the continent. This brings us to one of the most important aspects of our project. 
 
GROWING THE LAND
Please don't get confused. This whole fundraiser is about growing The Land... the TV show. However, as a part of our ultimate vision, we want The Land to contribute to the overall growth of Africa, the Motherland, and its people. The following are ways we will support the communities we feature on the show:

Every episode will feature and an entity (person, business, etc) who contributes to the overall growth of the content and is in need of support to grow further, by which we will help them obtain. 
We will donate a percentage of The Land's earnings to schools, orphanages, rehabilitation centers and more, with the help of its contributors and viewers alike. 
All of the employed production team will be persons of the African Diaspora. 
We will bring the wonderment of Africa that has been hidden from the world so the future is full of those that look to this great land with hope 

 

CHALLENGES
Of course there are challenges! To bring darkness to the light is not meant to be easy, but where there's a will there is always a way. We, Jah Kobi and the rest of The Land team, are dedicated to achieving the mission and vision no matter what obstacles stand in our way.
Even if we don't raise a single $1 in this campaign, we will begin shooting as early as April to begin obtaining footage for future episodes. Of course, to achieve the goal of 13 episodes in 9 months (26 in 18 months) we will definitely need to raise more funds to expand the team and its resources, but we will continue to work diligently to achieve our vision.
Nonetheless... we have already gotten started:

We have already personally acquired basic equipment to begin acquiring content. 
We shot and started post-production for the pilot episode (which will be available for all contributors to view) 
We have created a rough production schedule for Q2 2020 which includes concepts, locations, events and people to feature. 

After we spend much of the first season in Ghana, we plan to begin traveling to various other African countries (like Nigeria, South Africa, Rwanda and many more) that we will continue on in the 2nd season and even further seasons thereafter. Many of these international locations require work visas and permits to shoot there. The time to acquire these documents may prohibit us from being able to shoot there on schedule, but these are issues that the team is experienced and well prepared to handle. 
If you have locations suggestions, connections or advice for any international locations, please email the team at thelandtvshow@gmail.com.
 

NOT ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE $$$?
No problem! Even if you can't donate money WE STILL NEED YOU!
Though we have writers and producers that will provide their ideas and visions for the show, we want all of our contributors to be able to positively be a part of the origin and building of The Land and its goals. 
We welcome all ideas in regards to WHAT YOU WANT to see:

style of the show and its segments
events that you might want us to attend and feature
people you would like to get to know
places / locations you want us to visit

And if none of the above you can always SPREAD THE WORD!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi! my name is Christina Boyd, and I have been acting for about 10 years. I am a first time writer and producer for this web series I created, ""Roommates."" This is a series I've been thinking about for a long time now and I am craving to bring it to life. And I started to do just that with my own money, but this thing costs a pretty penny, and I'll need just a little bit of help.</li>
<li>This story takes you on a journey with a group of friends, navigating their everyday lives that involve dating, social issues and awkward experiences, while attending college. Its a fun time with a very talented cast and crew and we are all passionate to put ""roommates"" on the map! But, we're also broke creatives so...there's that. Either way, we're having fun doing it! You can check out what we've done so far at <a href=""https://www.obsidiantv.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.obsidiantv.com/</a>
</li>
<li>Much love from all of us and thank you for your support!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We will need $15,000.00 to finish our web series. We already started filming and completed a few episodes, but the funds will go toward completing season 1 and creating longer episodes. It will also go toward our studio set rentals, Post Production, Marketing, Promotional Merch, Hot meals, Crafty and other miscellaneous expenses that arise during Production and Post-Production.</li>
<li>This is a fundraising effort first and foremost, but we have some unique perks only found during this campaign as a thank you from the bottom of our hearts for getting in on the ground floor of our first Season!</li>
<li>Our goal is to complete production by February 2020. So we will be using funds immediately so as to make ""Roommates"" a reality as soon as possible!</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Donating to our campaign is the only way we finish our project and you will make all the difference with your contribution:</p>
<ul><li>At the end of the day, we are just a group of struggling actors yearning to tell a story. A funny one at that. And it fulfills us to no end to garner laughs in the room. You will find yourself relating to a number of characters,  rooting for them and wanting to see them grow and fail and learn. We just want the opportunity to see it through.</li></ul>
</div><div><ul><li>This project is valuable in that it is an original story derived from personal experiences, with a comedic take. We really put our all into it, from writing, to cast to crew.  I am independently funding this series, but, I can't do it alone.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The year is 2008 and sketch comedy is at its absolute peak--do you want to watch an intern help his boss dodge sniper rounds from a rival businessman? Watch Whitest Kids U Know. Do you want to watch Will Ferrell mangle his hand in a bunk bed accident? Lucky for you Step Brothers has just hit theaters. On top of all that, there's a new entertainment platform called YouTube housing a bunch of new channels dabbling in in sketch comedy, such as  CollegeHumor or Funny Or Die. </p>
<p>Fast forward to today and that original idea and pursuit of sketch comedy has evolved, or devolved, to new mediums like Tiktok to match the attention span of our current generation.</p>
<p>Odd Campus is the natural evolution of random and chaotic comedy that takes from the ancient channels of YouTube now buried under vloggers and ""influencers"", and from the more recent channels that are heavily stylized and reaching for the next peak of awkward, and combines the two. It’s something that can reflect how our generation views content and still fits within a college-aged sense of humor.</p>
<p>A channel that also utilizes the power of community and inside jokes, the goal of Odd Campus is to create an environment that establishes a world that makes you, once you've experienced it, feel like you’re one of the gang.</p>

<p>After our summer season finale you may be wondering: Will Delilah recover from wingman-mania and find her way to Columbia University? Does Harry have a shot at representing an illustrious literary-marvel? Will Jules ever find love, or a job, or maybe even just a friend? Did TJ break his back after being thrown up a stairwell oh-so-sexually by Nomi? </p>
<p>All this, and so much more, will be revealed in the new season of Everyone Else Has! </p>
<p>Over the past year, we have been hustling to create the first four episodes of EEH for you and the feedback from our audience has been excellent!

<h3>About Kyloki</h3>
<p>Kyloki is the first comedic web series venture from Leisure Elk Productions. It imagines a world in which a guy named Matt lives in an apartment with Loki from the Marvel universe and Kylo Ren from the Star Wars universe. Also along for their misadventures are Loki's friend Wanda (Scarlet Witch) and Kylo's younger brother Kyle Solo.</p>
<p>We premiered Season 1 at the end of 2016 and were so thrilled with the response! If you haven’t seen it yet, you can check out all six episodes here:</p>

<div>We love these characters and this world, and by contributing to our campaign, you'll help us tell more of their stories in the four new episodes.

<ul>
<li>Bringing back our AMAZING cast and crew</li>

<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Hair and makeup</li>
<li>New locations</li>

<p>Here's a little about just a few of our key players:</p>
<p><u>Leisure Elk Productions</u> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500352300/nigtda75h7vbvq4bu1wm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Born out of the crazed fangirl minds of Jordan Henry and Arielle Waldman, Leisure Elk is a production company dedicated to creating character driven comedy aimed at fellow pop culture addicts and comedy fans at large.</p>
<p><u>Arielle Waldman - Creator/Writer/Executive Producer</u></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500360666/rqzarkxbuddoc1yixzvu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Originally from the Midwest, Arielle Waldman has been writing since she was ten years old (most of her early work is illegible but will hopefully someday be worth millions). She has been working in the entertainment industry since 2011 and has experience in production, talent management, and television development. She studied creative writing at Emerson College, but her passion for writing comedy started at a young age by watching shows like The Nanny and Will &amp; Grace. Despite her parents' concerns, watching all that television has paid off, and she is fulfilling her dream of creating her own comedy series filled with the kind of complex and unique characters that first inspired her to write. When not writing, Arielle likes hunting for the best tacos in LA, creating gourmet popcorn, and dog sitting.</p>
<p><u>Jordan Henry - Creator/Writer/Executive Producer</u></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500354662/acovzcqszbavlbqfztt9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Jordan Henry grew up in southern West Virginia, where she spent much of her childhood watching Wishbone on PBS and reading Harry Potter as many times as possible. Her passion for storytelling propelled her to pursue a bachelor’s degree in radio &amp; television at the University of Central Florida and a master’s degree in television at Boston University. Since moving to LA in 2013, she has primarily worked in production on several primetime television series. In her free time, Jordan can often be found producing a comedy podcast, baking delicious desserts, and obsessing over ice hockey.</p>

<p>Morten Forland, a native of the wild western coast of Norway, is an award-winning, Los Angeles based writer, director and editor. With an early start making a Star Wars fanfilm at the age of 12, Morten has steadily been honing his filmmaking skills and earned a BA (University of Bergen) and an MFA (Loyola Marymount University) in Film and TV Production. His short film, Total Awesome Viking Power, has won him over twenty awards and more than eighty official festival selections world wide and has confirmed his strength in handling the nerdy, funny and action filled.</p>
<p>Morten is steadily directing and putting out original content. In addition to directing all six episodes in Season 1 of Kyloki, this past year he directed an action packed branded short for CollegeHumor and Ubisoft, Fatigued (a digital comedy pilot about an all female army bootcamp), five short-form digital concepts for TBS’s, The Heckler, a commercial for a new casting app, Upcast, as well as a proof-of-concept for a TV show and a series of promos for USA/Fandango and Red Lobster.</p>

<p>Born and raised in Puerto Rico, Jennevie learned English watching as many episodes of The Power Rangers as she could before bedtime. But it was grandmother’s fondness for telenovelas and her family’s dramatic tendencies that ignited her obsession with storytelling. Jennevie has been with Kyloki since the very beginning, and produced the first season of the show. She also produced the award winning short film TOTAL AWESOME VIKING POWER.</p>

I decided to move forward with the project for my own sanity, to provide a welcome distraction for others, and to stay true to the ideals of the project and make art even in the face of uncertainty. There is no pressure at all for anyone to give to this project, but that goes double for anyone (like myself) whose income has shifted due to the current situation. Take care of your family and your neighbors first, and if you have some leftovers after that then consider helping launch this thing and getting some fun rewards in return.*Now, on with the scheduled programming...*The BackstoryMoana stuck on an island. Harry Potter living under the stairs.At the start of most great stories the central character is living their everyday lives with a gnawing sense they are destined for something more.Sound familiar?We love these stories because they are our stories; or at least they could be.We want to be the one breaking into song and sailing the open seas, yet most of the time we're the ones staying behind stacking coconuts.If the things that make a great story make a great life, it stands to reason we can find ways to better our lives by stealing from the stories we love.That's the big idea behind this whole project.So What Is This, Exactly?Ben and the Family Quest is a few things.First, it's a way to sum up a commitment I am making to spend the 1,000 days leading up to my 30th birthday on an epic quest towards the life that up to now has been relegated to ""maybe someday.""My wife Erin and 2-year old son Forest are ready for the journey, too!Our quest won't involve long lost treasure or vanquishing evil, but it will involve...*New Music!and*A YouTube Show!+ some other ideas currently up our sleeves.(hear more about these in the video above)The 1,000 Day commitment starts on June 21, 2020 and runs through March 18, 2023 -- that's 3 years from the launch of this crowdfunding campaign, and my 30th birthday.If we get to that day and everything has been a historic disaster we'll reevaluate.Until that day, we are all in.The Vision(by March 18, 2023)For What I'll Have Made
15 New Songs (at least)
150 YouTube Episodes (at least)
A tour of live shows (at least 1)
A concrete step-by-step process to help people craft their own plan for their quests
A thriving online community, not only connected to me but also to each other
For Our FamilyWe will have made progress towards what we sum up as ""a lifestyle rich in fulfillment, freedom, community, and memories.""Since that's sweet but a little abstract we do also have concrete goals for our finances, calendars, and most aspects of our lifestyle. Those goals aren't necessarily for everyone to know, but they do exist and serve as tangible goals to work towards.For The Greater ImpactI have big dreams for this being about so much more than me, my music, and my family.If people can be inspired by our family (for lack of a less trite and cheesy word) giving them permission to pursue their own things then I will consider this whole thing a big success!​ And my hope is to connect people to each other through online community tools, so we can learn from and encourage each other along the way.The Part Where You Come In!I've put countless hours into dreaming and scheming over the last year and made it this far.But now I need your help!Tool Chest for The QuestEvery hero needs their tools. Mine are admittedly less awesome than intergalactic spaceships or magic wands.

<h2><strong>WHO am I and WHY this project</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Ina and I am the writer/director of ""Homies,"" a web series project. I've been a filmmaker and a TV production professional for about 4 years.</p>
<p>Last year, I began to visualize a web series. One that would explore different experiences of relationships that my friends and I have come to experience - with people who looked like us.</p>
<p>As a Filipino immigrant and a queer woman, I wanted to create stories that feature Filipino queer women - ones that I rarely see in media. I also wanted to give a stage to others who are people of color and in the lgbtq+ spectrum. Many times these groups are portrayed by their struggles: their coming out stories and their stories of oppression. While these are important experiences, the media ignores other aspects of their lives - ones that end up being told by people who look and act nothing like them.</p>
<p>The Homies web series aims to normalize our stories within society.</p>
<h2>WHAT is Homies</h2>
<p>""Homies"" will be a collection of four short films. (Maybe more if things go well) Each episode has different characters and has a different theme, all featuring queer-identifying people and people of color. For ROUND 1, we are raising money for Episode 2!!</p>
<p>Brief Description of eps:</p>
<p>1st EP: Two best friends navigate their friends-with-benefits relationship</p>
<p>2nd EP: A couple enjoys their last day before a long-distance relationship</p>
<p>3rd EP: A homeless couple tries to get clean and get off the streets together</p>
<p>4th EP: A middle-aged couple look back on the start of their relationship</p>
<h2>WHEN do you see the product</h2>
<p>The FIRST EPISODE has already been produced and is being submitted to film festivals this year. It has already been included in a few film festivals!</p>
<p>Our aim is to produce the second episode late fall and then the others early next year. We are going to fundraise until we reach our goal. </p>
<h2>WHERE does the money go towards</h2>
<p>The Cast and Crew! Everything is about them!! We want to pay everyone for their hard work and we want to make sure they have enough to eat. Equipment rentals and location fees are the least of our worries. </p>
<p>(For the 1st episode, the cast and crew worked pro bono and that production still cost me $2,000! )</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help </p>
<p>Share, share, share!!! In addition to trying to get funds, we are also trying to build an audience so getting the word out is very important.</p>

Dove sono i suoi genitori?</p><p>Se sei arrivato qui, devi sapere che il nostro intento è di raccontare una storia che ti faccia provare esattamente la sensazione che prova un bambino lasciato da solo, a sé stesso. Non lo facciamo per sadismo, ma per sensibilizzare chiunque ad un aspetto della nostra società molto importante. Sono minimo 35 milioni i bambini che vengono lasciati da soli nel mondo, sia che essi siano alcuni tra i 150 milioni di orfani, sia che siano figli di famiglie benestanti occidentali. Immaginate la metà della popolazione italiana. Immaginate che metà della vostra nazione sia composta solo, esclusivamente da bambini soli. Immagina che uno di loro sei tu, o tuo figlio.</p><p>Se deciderai di volerci aiutare, noi daremo il massimo per rappresentare questa condizione e sensibilizzare il pubblico, ma lo faremo senza toni melodrammatici e lo racconteremo come una fiaba contemporanea. Aiutaci, con un piccolo contributo sensibilizzerai tutti i grandi a prendere consapevolezza di un aspetto poco noto della società in cui viviamo.</p><p>Chi siamo?</p><p>Siamo Amarena Pictures, una casa di produzione italiana fondata da due registi.</p><p>Il nostro core business è principalmente la creazione di pubblicità tv/web.</p><p>Siamo entusiasti di annunciare il crowdfunding della short series Doorlight. Racconta di Thea, una bambina di dieci anni, che vive da sola in una grande casa. Il tema che andremo a toccare è proprio l'abbandono e la solitudine infantile. Alcuni di voi, forse in particolare quelli che sono figli unici, probabilmente sanno a cosa ci riferiamo. Altri ricorderanno dei momenti personali, perché è capitato a tutti almeno una volta di trovarsi soli in casa da piccoli.</p><p>La serie Doorlight sarà diretta dai due registi Giovanni Caloro e Alessandro Merletti De Palo:</p><p>Nei diversi episodi vedremo la piccola protagonista compiere azioni di tutti i giorni: prepara il pranzo, lava i piatti, disegna su un grande tavolo in silenzio oppure, si spazzola i capelli prima di andare a dormire. Azioni semplici che, nell'assenza dei suoi genitori o di altre persone, portano lo spettatore a pensare: perché questa bambina vive in quella grande casa da sola? Il mistero cresce quando Thea sente una voce, una voce che le fa domande e la spaventa. Questa voce proviene da una delle porte della casa ma, questa sembra essere bloccata e inaccessibile. In più, dalla stessa porta, un forte spiraglio di luce illumina la stanza. Chi è quella voce? Chi c'è dietro la porta? L'idea dietro la storia è quella che la resistenza di tutti i piccoli esseri umani che si ritrovano da soli può essere una forza vincente che supera ogni sfida ma, allo stesso tempo questi piccoli eroi non dovrebbero essere lasciati soli.</p><p>Lo scopo del progetto è quindi rappresentare questa condizione dei bambini e partendo da qui diffondere questo tema attraverso un network di comunicazione internazionale.</p><p>Abbiamo bisogno di 50.000€ per produrre l'intera serie Doorlight. Ma come potete vedere al momento vi stiamo chiedendo solamente 15.000€ così da riuscire a produrre i primi due episodi e iniziare a diffondere il messaggio. Raggiungere il nostro obiettivo di Indiegogo sarebbe solo il primo passo del nostro viaggio. Ed è per questo che superarlo sarebbe ancora meglio: con 30.000€ saremo in grado di produrre quattro episodi e con 50.000€ riusciremo a dare vita all'intera storia di Thea.</p><p>Crediamo che un'iniziativa del genere possa essere anche un'opportunità per tutti gli amanti del cinema che vogliono prendere parte ad un progetto reale e ambizioso. Nello specifico, poiché le campagne crowdfunding offrono ricompense per chi supporta il progetto, abbiamo pensato di dedicare alcune di queste a chi vorrà supportarci con il cuore e chi invece, come gli studenti e amanti di cinema, con la propria passione professionale:</p><p>1) Il tuo Nome nei titoli: 1€</p><p>2) Un Ringraziamento Speciale nei titoli: 5€</p><p>3) Ricevi immagini del Dietro le Quinte in Alta Qualità: 10€</p><p>4) Live! e una Preview degli Episodi: 20€</p><p>5) Download in Alta Qualità + Dietro le Quinte + Contenuti Speciali: 30€</p><p>6) Segui e aiuta il Montaggio: 100€</p><p>7) Preview dell'intera Sceneggiatura: 150€</p><p>8) Festa in Piscina + Maglietta Crew: 200€</p><p>9) Raggiungici sul Set per un giorno + Cena: 400€</p><p>10) Diventa una Comparsa + Corso di recitazione di 1 giorno: 750€</p><p>11) Associate Producer + Corso di produzione di 1 giorno: 1000€</p><p>12) Associate Producer + Corso intensivo di filmmaking: 1.500€</p><p>13) Producer - Segui il corso, inviaci un tuo soggetto e vieni a tutti gli eventi Doorlight: 2000€</p><p>Nota: tutte le ricompense contengono le precedenti. </p><p>Come potete vedere, le ultime implicano la reale possibilità di partecipare attivamente alle riprese sul set di Doorlight! Quindi, potreste avere l'opportunità, sia che siate studenti, sia che siate padri o madri e vorrete partecipare con i vostri figli, di far parte del mondo di Doorlight. Il nostro scopo è quello di condividere questa iniziativa con voi, cosicché possiate sia aiutarci a sviluppare questo progetto sia essere coinvolti in un'esperienza unica!</p><p>Nello specifico, per gli studenti abbiamo:</p><p>CORSO DI RECITAZIONE DI 1 GIORNO:</p><p>Avrai l'opportunità di imparare cosa significa RECITARE su un vero set. Sceglierai una scena e sarai diretto nel rappresentarla parte. Imparerai a controllare i tuoi movimenti, a migliorare le tue tecniche di respirazione e la tua dizione, tutto questo nel contesto del set.</p><p>CORSO DI PRODUZIONE DI 1 GIORNO:</p><p>Avrai l'opportunità di imparare tutto ciò che c'è da sapere nel campo della PRODUZIONE e cosa si nasconde dietro ad un set perfettamente funzionante. Dal punto di vista finanziario e organizzativo, potrai scoprire i ruoli e i compiti non solo di chi prende parte al set, ma anche di chi si occupa delle fasi di pre e post produzione.</p><p>CORSO INTENSIVO DI FILMMAKING:</p><p>Avrai la possibilità di imparare tutto su PRODUZIONE e REGIA! Questa è la tua migliore occasione per poter finalmente apprendere mentre vivi l'esperienza del set e pratichi la tua passione. Avrai modo di relazionarti e capire ruoli e compiti di tutte le persone sul set, l'utilizzo corretto dell'attrezzatura, la grammatica delle inquadrature e infine vedere come tutto questo confluisce nel montaggio.</p><p>Vogliamo inoltre assicurarvi che qualora non raggiungessimo neanche in minima parte l'obbiettivo fissato, necessario per produrre Doorlight, considereremo l'eventualità di donare i soldi raccolti ad un'associazione che supporta i diritti dei bambini.</p><p>Se volete darci una mano in altri modi, scriveteci, aiutateci contattando i vostri amici: mandategli una mail con il link a questa pagina anche se non avete finanziato il progetto!</p><p>Speriamo vi piaccia il nostro trailer e che vogliate unirvi a noi nel diffondere questa storia unica e ricca di significato.</p><p>Non perdete questa occasione, unisciti a noi nel mondo di Doorlight!</p><p><strong>ENGLISH</strong></p><p>Some children are left home alone. How do they feel? What silence surrounds them? Where are their parents? </p><p>If you’re here, please know that our goal is to tell a story that will make you feel just like as a child left home alone.</p><p>We don’t do it for sadistic purposes, but to make people conscious about a very important aspect of our society. There are at least 35 million children who are left alone in the world, whether they are some of the 150 million orphans, or they are children of western wealthy families. </p><p>Imagine half the population of Italy. Imagine, now, that half of Italy is made up of lonely children. </p><p>Imagine one of them. it could be you, it could be your son.</p><p>If you’ll decide to support us, we will do our best to represent this aspect of our children and raise public awareness. We’ll do it without melodramatic tones but telling a story that is like a contemporary fairy tale. Help us now: with a small amount of money you will make many adults aware of this less-known aspect of our society.</p><p>Who we are? </p><p>We are amarena Pictures, an Italian production company founded by two directors. Our core business is mainly the creation of TV/ web advertising.</p><p>We are thrilled to tell you about the story of a short series named Doorlight. It talks about Thea, a ten years old girl, who lives alone in a big house. The theme that we will discover at the end of the story is about children loneliness.</p><p>The name of our project is Doorlight, a short series directed by the two directors Giovanni Caloro and Alessandro merletti De Palo: “we have the intent of telling a story, the story of a little girl, Thea, who lives alone in her house. Some of you, especially those who are only children, probably know what we mean. Others will probably remember some personal occasions in which they were left home alone: it has happened to everyone at least once when we were children.”</p><p>In the several episodes we’ll watch the little protagonist make everyday actions like preparing lunch, washing dishes, drawing or brushing her hair before going to sleep. Simple actions that, in the absence of her parents or other people, make the viewer wonder: why is this child living in that big house all alone?  The mystery gets bigger when Thea starts to hear a voice, asking her questions and scaring her. The voice comes from one of the doors of the house but it seems to be locked and inaccessible. From the same door, we see a strong blade of light that illuminates the room. Who’s that voice? Who’s behind that door? The idea behind the story is that the endurance of all little human beings who face loneliness can be a winning force that overcomes every challenge, but at the same time they shouldn’t be left alone.</p><p>The aim of the project is therefore to depict the condition of lone children, and out of it to create a joint communication about this theme through an international network.</p><p>We need about 50.000€ to produce the entire Doorlight series. But as you can see at the moment we are asking you only 15.000€, so we are able to produce the first two episodes and starting to spread awareness on  our children loneliness message. Reaching our Indiegogo goal would be only the first step of our journey. And that's why overcoming it would be even better. With 30.000€ we'll be able to produce four episodes and with 50.000€ we'll be able to show the complete story of Thea.</p><p>We believe that an initiative like this could be also an opportunity for cinephiles to take part in a real and ambitious project. In particular, crowdfunding campaigns require rewards for those who support the project, so we thought about perks even for cinema students and lovers:</p><p>1) Name in titles: 1€</p><p>2) Special thanks in titles: 5€</p><p>3) Receive High Quality BTS images: 10€</p><p>4) Live! and Episodes Previews: 20€</p><p>5) HQ Download + BTS + Special Content: 30€</p><p>6) Exclusive: Follow and help the Editing: 100€</p><p>7) Full Script Preview: 150€</p><p>8) Pool Party + Crew T-shirt: 200€</p><p>9) Come with us 1 day on set + dinner: 400€</p><p>10) Be an Extra + 1 day actor course: 750€</p><p>11) Associate producer + 1-day course: 1.000€</p><p>12) Associate producer + Full course: 1.500€</p><p>13) Producer: Your Script, Invitations, Course: 2.000€</p><p>Note: all the rewards contain the previous ones.</p><p>Our aim is to share this initiative with you, both to help us carry out this project and to make you involved in an experience which could certainly be interesting to a film lover and that's why the last entries imply the real possibility to actively participate in the shooting and on the Doorlight set!</p><p>1 DAY ACTOR COURSE:</p><p>You will have the chance to learn what ACTING on a real set means. You will choose a scene and you'll be directed on how to be in it. You'll practice how to control your movement, to improve your breathing techniques and your diction, all of this in the context of the set.</p><p>1 DAY COURSE:</p><p>You will have the chance to learn everything about the PRODUCTION flow that is behind a perfectly working set. From the financial and organizational point of view, you will be able to discover each role and their duties not only on the set but also before and after the shooting.</p><p>FULL COURSE:</p><p>You will have the chance to learn everything about PRODUCTION AND DIRECTION! This is your best option to finally learn while actually living the experience and practicing what you love. You'll be able to understand roles and duties of all the people on set, discover the use of technical equipment, learn about shooting geometry and grammar and also see how all of this merges in the editing.</p><p>We want to clarify that if we could not reach the amount needed to produce Doorlight, we could evaluate to donate the money to an association supporting child rights.</p><p>If you want to support us in other ways, write us, help us or contact your friends: send them an email even if you didn't largely fund the project!</p><p>We hope you will like our trailer and join us in spreading this meaningful, unique story.</p><p>Don't miss this opportunity, learn and come join us into the Doorlight world!</p></div>","English version below.Un bambino viene lasciato a casa da solo.

Avrai modo di relazionarti e capire ruoli e compiti di tutte le persone sul set, l'utilizzo corretto dell'attrezzatura, la grammatica delle inquadrature e infine vedere come tutto questo confluisce nel montaggio.Vogliamo inoltre assicurarvi che qualora non raggiungessimo neanche in minima parte l'obbiettivo fissato, necessario per produrre Doorlight, considereremo l'eventualità di donare i soldi raccolti ad un'associazione che supporta i diritti dei bambini.Se volete darci una mano in altri modi, scriveteci, aiutateci contattando i vostri amici: mandategli una mail con il link a questa pagina anche se non avete finanziato il progetto!Speriamo vi piaccia il nostro trailer e che vogliate unirvi a noi nel diffondere questa storia unica e ricca di significato.Non perdete questa occasione, unisciti a noi nel mondo di Doorlight!ENGLISHSome children are left home alone. How do they feel? What silence surrounds them? Where are their parents? If you’re here, please know that our goal is to tell a story that will make you feel just like as a child left home alone.We don’t do it for sadistic purposes, but to make people conscious about a very important aspect of our society. There are at least 35 million children who are left alone in the world, whether they are some of the 150 million orphans, or they are children of western wealthy families. Imagine half the population of Italy. Imagine, now, that half of Italy is made up of lonely children. Imagine one of them. it could be you, it could be your son.If you’ll decide to support us, we will do our best to represent this aspect of our children and raise public awareness. We’ll do it without melodramatic tones but telling a story that is like a contemporary fairy tale. Help us now: with a small amount of money you will make many adults aware of this less-known aspect of our society.Who we are? We are amarena Pictures, an Italian production company founded by two directors. Our core business is mainly the creation of TV/ web advertising.We are thrilled to tell you about the story of a short series named Doorlight. It talks about Thea, a ten years old girl, who lives alone in a big house. The theme that we will discover at the end of the story is about children loneliness.The name of our project is Doorlight, a short series directed by the two directors Giovanni Caloro and Alessandro merletti De Palo: “we have the intent of telling a story, the story of a little girl, Thea, who lives alone in her house. Some of you, especially those who are only children, probably know what we mean. Others will probably remember some personal occasions in which they were left home alone: it has happened to everyone at least once when we were children.”In the several episodes we’ll watch the little protagonist make everyday actions like preparing lunch, washing dishes, drawing or brushing her hair before going to sleep. Simple actions that, in the absence of her parents or other people, make the viewer wonder: why is this child living in that big house all alone?  The mystery gets bigger when Thea starts to hear a voice, asking her questions and scaring her. The voice comes from one of the doors of the house but it seems to be locked and inaccessible. From the same door, we see a strong blade of light that illuminates the room. Who’s that voice? Who’s behind that door? The idea behind the story is that the endurance of all little human beings who face loneliness can be a winning force that overcomes every challenge, but at the same time they shouldn’t be left alone.The aim of the project is therefore to depict the condition of lone children, and out of it to create a joint communication about this theme through an international network.We need about 50.000€ to produce the entire Doorlight series. But as you can see at the moment we are asking you only 15.000€, so we are able to produce the first two episodes and starting to spread awareness on  our children loneliness message. Reaching our Indiegogo goal would be only the first step of our journey. And that's why overcoming it would be even better. With 30.000€ we'll be able to produce four episodes and with 50.000€ we'll be able to show the complete story of Thea.We believe that an initiative like this could be also an opportunity for cinephiles to take part in a real and ambitious project. In particular, crowdfunding campaigns require rewards for those who support the project, so we thought about perks even for cinema students and lovers:1) Name in titles: 1€2) Special thanks in titles: 5€3) Receive High Quality BTS images: 10€4) Live! and Episodes Previews: 20€5) HQ Download + BTS + Special Content: 30€6) Exclusive: Follow and help the Editing: 100€7) Full Script Preview: 150€8) Pool Party + Crew T-shirt: 200€9) Come with us 1 day on set + dinner: 400€10) Be an Extra + 1 day actor course: 750€11) Associate producer + 1-day course: 1.000€12) Associate producer + Full course: 1.500€13) Producer: Your Script, Invitations, Course: 2.000€Note: all the rewards contain the previous ones.Our aim is to share this initiative with you, both to help us carry out this project and to make you involved in an experience which could certainly be interesting to a film lover and that's why the last entries imply the real possibility to actively participate in the shooting and on the Doorlight set!1 DAY ACTOR COURSE:You will have the chance to learn what ACTING on a real set means. You will choose a scene and you'll be directed on how to be in it. You'll practice how to control your movement, to improve your breathing techniques and your diction, all of this in the context of the set.1 DAY COURSE:You will have the chance to learn everything about the PRODUCTION flow that is behind a perfectly working set.

<h3>What is City Boyz?</h3>
<p><i>City Boyz  </i>is a five episode original comedy series that follows two adults brothers (Trystan and Teddy Jenkins) who still live at home with their mother, Tamela, in a small town in Florida. The boys win a radio sweepstakes with a video submission (including an interpretive dance directed, choreographed and stage managed by Trystan) that awards them an all expense paid trip to NYC. Trystan, the ultimate theatre queen of Southern Florida, is psyched. He's always dreamed of flashing his jazz hands on the Great White Way and this may be his chance. Teddy, the resident hypochondriac of the family, can only focus on crime statistics and everything that could possibly go wrong.</p>
<p>Their mother encourages them to go on the trip to allow her some quality time with her husband, Mr. Richard, who she recently met on NeedaDaddy.com. With the help of a New York City guidebook, they map out the adventures that they will embark on. The problem is, they are pretty out of touch with what the big city has in store and run into a myriad of situations that they are ill equipped to handle.</p>

<h3>Why We Want To Make This Series</h3>
<p>In the entertainment industry, it is important for actors to produce their own original content. With <i>City Boyz</i>, we are hoping to create visibility for ourselves and our collaborators.

<p>Not only do we want this experience, to stretch our skills as writers/ producers/ actors, but we want to bring you a show that makes you want to come back each week for a new episode. We love to make people laugh. There is too much craziness in the world sometimes and we want to provide an escape for you to run to that feels like a warm blanket or a nice hot beverage. Who doesn't like a hot bev?! This series is an offbeat, stylized story that could only be told by us.

<h3><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/hellgate-academy/x/15824976#/updates/1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Please Read This Important Campaign Update</a></h3>
<p>Due to some personal events during the first week of our campaign, we made the difficuly decision to diminish our public activity on this fundraiser.  Without the constant plugging of the campaign, we know we probably won't reach our goal, and that's okay. We have already come up with some really great ideas to bring this project to life within our own means, starting with a LIVE multimedia staged reading. Please contribute if you can to help bring the best possible version of this to life. </p>
<p>And thanks for your words of support. They actually mean more to us than any donation you could have provided.</p>
<h3>What is Hellgate Academy?</h3>
<p>We were initially inspired by the fantasy stories of writers like C.S. Lewis (The Screwtape Letters), Dante (The Divine Comedy), Milton (Paradise Lost), the Book of Revelations, and the ""seven deadly sins."" At its core, the production will be a showcase for the kind of work we would like to do, and the kind of show we want to watch: snappy dialogue set to a compelling story examining universal themes.</p>
<p>The script has quite a few special effects &amp; makeup elements, so we need to raise money to actually make the project look good and ensure everyone involved is paid fairly. The entire first season has already been written, about 10 episodes, each episode lasting about 7 to 10 minutes, so if we tried to raise enough to shoot the entire series, it would  essentially be like making  a feature film. Since that kind of money is a lot to ask for in one go, we're hoping to secure the funds to make the first two episodes now, and release those episodes in advance as a proof of concept to generate interest in creating the rest of the series in the future. Special effects and makeup and such increase the production costs; and the series is demanding. This isn’t a living room sitcom; this is a  battle between good and evil. It’s a big cast and our friends from the New York acting community will be joining us. We believe that our cast and crew deserve to be paid for their work, and that their work will be better if we show them our appreciation with financial support. That means at LEAST paying SAG minimums or they wouldn’t be allowed to show. So we may be asking for a lot, but in terms of budgets for feature films, it's been very conservatively budgeted.</p>
<p>We'd like to create this series as a showcase for the type of work we want to do on film, as well as showcase the many wonderful actors we have met on my journey. We've created something that will be fun to watch, be easy to relate to, and pushes a few buttons along the way, purposely designed for the short episodic format that web-video excels at. With your help, we can put together a team to make this project even better.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497548654/mdjolnon0f1swpaaplow.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We'd like to assemble a team of experienced professionals to help bring this series to life. In order for a professional cast and crew to spend a week shooting in New York City, we need a lot of money. We'd love to raise over $10,000 to pay our actors and all of the rest of the production crew and staff.</p>
<p>$25 gives us a roll of gaff tape.  $100 could allow us to rent a 15-passenger van for a day. $500 covers the cost of our entire crew, on set, for a full day of shooting. Your help makes a big difference.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498005623/fgvlu0xztzegjl1hbetf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Now, let’s be honest: $10,000 may not actually cover the cost of this whole venture, especially since crowdfunding fees eat up a percentage of the contributions.  We'd be overjoyed to go beyond that goal, because then we could afford to make each episode even better, and get started on making the rest of the series as well. The better the quality, the more likely people will watch it, and the more likely the story can have an impact on other people, future seasons, merchandise, and more.</p>
<p>The ultimate plan is to release a new episode once a week for 10 weeks on YouTube. To build a community and increase YouTube channel activity, we plan to post special behind-the-scene features a few days after each episode, and possibly some special background episodes, livestream interviews, or Viewer Comment Response videos a few days before each episode release. We'd also like to supplement the webseries with a social media campaign from the perspective of one of the characters, like Warren Wood's Tumblr page and Instagram account.</p>
<p>The more you contribute, the closer we can be to making all of these goals come true. If we miss our goal, that's okay. Your contribution will be used to wisely take the next steps in creating as much of series as possible in a reasonable manner. Maybe we have to scale down some of the production values. Maybe we can't afford to get permission to film on-location, so we have to make some warehouse in New Jersey look like a park along the East River in New York. Maybe we only have enough to make a really good trailer. Maybe we have to publish a comic book instead of a webseries at first. Whatever we get could be used as a proof of concept to get the project to the next level. </p>

<h3>Tell me more about this...</h3>
<p>Hellgate Academy is about a young man from Astoria, New York who learns after years of living as a human, that he is actually a Demon. We follow his story as he struggles through his Tempter training at Hellgate Academy. It's made for people who want to see a magical world like Harry Potter grown up and inverted, with the snarky dialogue of Joss Whedon, and some of the armchair philosiphizing of Dogma.</p>
<p>Accessed through a secret door under Hellgate Bridge, which is an actual bridge in Astoria Park in an outer borough of New York City, Hellgate Academy is like the ivy leagues of demon schools. Our hero, Warren is only there because his uncle is a high ranking official in the demon government. After Warren gets in a few mishaps in his first few days at school, the students are assigned a Human to tempt to the Darkness. But it turns out that Warren is not good at this at all. </p>
<p>Intended as a New Media series for broadcast on YouTube, the story is told in 10 episodes, of about 7 to 10 minutes each. Each episode follows Warren as he attempts to practice a different skill, commonly known as the Seven Deadly Sins. Episodes start with short cold-opens that mimic ""found footage,"" showing Warren succeeding or failing at new assignments, before continuing the episode in a standard episodic shooting format. </p>
<p>The real struggle for Warren is not being able to achieve success despite all the evidence that this is his calling.  But there is a deeper truth. He fails so much at being evil because he may not truly be entirely evil, and he is at the center of a battle larger than all of humanity, angels, and demons. <span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Although the main character is a demon, he's fundamentally flawed. Those flaws are what viewers will relate to as he tries to make sense of the world around him. His struggles mirror the struggles so many people have had when wrestling with their own beliefs and morals. His failures mirror the failures so many people have had when ... Sometimes its funny, sometimes its heart-wrenching. But with your help it can be done right, and hopefully have a lasting impact on the viewers.</span></p>
<p>The pursuit of a creative life is a struggle. We wanted to find a way to put that struggle into the work, and entertain an audience with a fun and socially relevant story. Yes, this story concerns religion. It also features some speculative mysteries about  real-life landmarks in the outer-boroughs of New York, the underground NY theatre scene, and an eclectic community of artists battling for their way-of-life. Oh- also a Frappuccino-obsessed guardian angel.</p>
<p>The writer/producer/star is Kane Prestenback. Kane has been acting professionally for over 15 years. Since graduating Circle in the Square Theatre School on Broadway, he's focused on new theatrical works, regional theatres, short films, and guest star television roles. His appearance in premiere of The Tallest Building in the World (at Luna Stage) garnered rave reviews including one from the New York Times. He has appeared on Travel Channel, Lifetime, Discovery ID, American Heroes Channel, and lead roles in many short films and webseries, and he has worked in New York with NYMF, Old Vic New Voices, Public Theatre, John Gould Rubin, and Theodore Mann. He was a participant in the inaugural TS Eliot US/UK Exchange, in association with London’s Old Vic and Kevin Spacey.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We've already touched upon some alternative plans if we don't reach our goal. We think that this story carries a message that is important for society today, so we plan to do everything we can to surmount those challenges. The goal is to assemble an experienced production team that will be able to take a look at our production means realistically. We also plan to reach out to local New York businesses for potential branding and product placement opportunities, since the events of the series take place in a specific place and time. This could help preserve costs and bring in additional funds for production.</p>
<p>We've also got some really great people who have already expressed interest in being involved. We think having these people on board will help generate publicity and anchor the production in a high regard for quality.

Please Read This Important Campaign Update
Due to some personal events during the first week of our campaign, we made the difficuly decision to diminish our public activity on this fundraiser.  Without the constant plugging of the campaign, we know we probably won't reach our goal, and that's okay. We have already come up with some really great ideas to bring this project to life within our own means, starting with a LIVE multimedia staged reading. Please contribute if you can to help bring the best possible version of this to life. 
And thanks for your words of support. They actually mean more to us than any donation you could have provided.
What is Hellgate Academy?
We were initially inspired by the fantasy stories of writers like C.S. Lewis (The Screwtape Letters), Dante (The Divine Comedy), Milton (Paradise Lost), the Book of Revelations, and the ""seven deadly sins."" At its core, the production will be a showcase for the kind of work we would like to do, and the kind of show we want to watch: snappy dialogue set to a compelling story examining universal themes.
The script has quite a few special effects & makeup elements, so we need to raise money to actually make the project look good and ensure everyone involved is paid fairly. The entire first season has already been written, about 10 episodes, each episode lasting about 7 to 10 minutes, so if we tried to raise enough to shoot the entire series, it would  essentially be like making  a feature film. Since that kind of money is a lot to ask for in one go, we're hoping to secure the funds to make the first two episodes now, and release those episodes in advance as a proof of concept to generate interest in creating the rest of the series in the future. Special effects and makeup and such increase the production costs; and the series is demanding. This isn’t a living room sitcom; this is a  battle between good and evil. It’s a big cast and our friends from the New York acting community will be joining us. We believe that our cast and crew deserve to be paid for their work, and that their work will be better if we show them our appreciation with financial support. That means at LEAST paying SAG minimums or they wouldn’t be allowed to show. So we may be asking for a lot, but in terms of budgets for feature films, it's been very conservatively budgeted.
We'd like to create this series as a showcase for the type of work we want to do on film, as well as showcase the many wonderful actors we have met on my journey. We've created something that will be fun to watch, be easy to relate to, and pushes a few buttons along the way, purposely designed for the short episodic format that web-video excels at. With your help, we can put together a team to make this project even better.


What We Need & What You Get
We'd like to assemble a team of experienced professionals to help bring this series to life. In order for a professional cast and crew to spend a week shooting in New York City, we need a lot of money. We'd love to raise over $10,000 to pay our actors and all of the rest of the production crew and staff.
$25 gives us a roll of gaff tape.  $100 could allow us to rent a 15-passenger van for a day. $500 covers the cost of our entire crew, on set, for a full day of shooting. Your help makes a big difference.

Now, let’s be honest: $10,000 may not actually cover the cost of this whole venture, especially since crowdfunding fees eat up a percentage of the contributions.  We'd be overjoyed to go beyond that goal, because then we could afford to make each episode even better, and get started on making the rest of the series as well. The better the quality, the more likely people will watch it, and the more likely the story can have an impact on other people, future seasons, merchandise, and more.
The ultimate plan is to release a new episode once a week for 10 weeks on YouTube. To build a community and increase YouTube channel activity, we plan to post special behind-the-scene features a few days after each episode, and possibly some special background episodes, livestream interviews, or Viewer Comment Response videos a few days before each episode release. We'd also like to supplement the webseries with a social media campaign from the perspective of one of the characters, like Warren Wood's Tumblr page and Instagram account.
The more you contribute, the closer we can be to making all of these goals come true. If we miss our goal, that's okay. Your contribution will be used to wisely take the next steps in creating as much of series as possible in a reasonable manner. Maybe we have to scale down some of the production values. Maybe we can't afford to get permission to film on-location, so we have to make some warehouse in New Jersey look like a park along the East River in New York. Maybe we only have enough to make a really good trailer. Maybe we have to publish a comic book instead of a webseries at first. Whatever we get could be used as a proof of concept to get the project to the next level. 


Tell me more about this...
Hellgate Academy is about a young man from Astoria, New York who learns after years of living as a human, that he is actually a Demon. We follow his story as he struggles through his Tempter training at Hellgate Academy. It's made for people who want to see a magical world like Harry Potter grown up and inverted, with the snarky dialogue of Joss Whedon, and some of the armchair philosiphizing of Dogma.
Accessed through a secret door under Hellgate Bridge, which is an actual bridge in Astoria Park in an outer borough of New York City, Hellgate Academy is like the ivy leagues of demon schools. Our hero, Warren is only there because his uncle is a high ranking official in the demon government. After Warren gets in a few mishaps in his first few days at school, the students are assigned a Human to tempt to the Darkness. But it turns out that Warren is not good at this at all. 
Intended as a New Media series for broadcast on YouTube, the story is told in 10 episodes, of about 7 to 10 minutes each. Each episode follows Warren as he attempts to practice a different skill, commonly known as the Seven Deadly Sins. Episodes start with short cold-opens that mimic ""found footage,"" showing Warren succeeding or failing at new assignments, before continuing the episode in a standard episodic shooting format. 
The real struggle for Warren is not being able to achieve success despite all the evidence that this is his calling.  But there is a deeper truth. He fails so much at being evil because he may not truly be entirely evil, and he is at the center of a battle larger than all of humanity, angels, and demons. Although the main character is a demon, he's fundamentally flawed. Those flaws are what viewers will relate to as he tries to make sense of the world around him. His struggles mirror the struggles so many people have had when wrestling with their own beliefs and morals. His failures mirror the failures so many people have had when ... Sometimes its funny, sometimes its heart-wrenching. But with your help it can be done right, and hopefully have a lasting impact on the viewers.
The pursuit of a creative life is a struggle. We wanted to find a way to put that struggle into the work, and entertain an audience with a fun and socially relevant story. Yes, this story concerns religion. It also features some speculative mysteries about  real-life landmarks in the outer-boroughs of New York, the underground NY theatre scene, and an eclectic community of artists battling for their way-of-life. Oh- also a Frappuccino-obsessed guardian angel.
The writer/producer/star is Kane Prestenback. Kane has been acting professionally for over 15 years. Since graduating Circle in the Square Theatre School on Broadway, he's focused on new theatrical works, regional theatres, short films, and guest star television roles. His appearance in premiere of The Tallest Building in the World (at Luna Stage) garnered rave reviews including one from the New York Times. He has appeared on Travel Channel, Lifetime, Discovery ID, American Heroes Channel, and lead roles in many short films and webseries, and he has worked in New York with NYMF, Old Vic New Voices, Public Theatre, John Gould Rubin, and Theodore Mann. He was a participant in the inaugural TS Eliot US/UK Exchange, in association with London’s Old Vic and Kevin Spacey.


Risks & Challenges
We've already touched upon some alternative plans if we don't reach our goal. We think that this story carries a message that is important for society today, so we plan to do everything we can to surmount those challenges. The goal is to assemble an experienced production team that will be able to take a look at our production means realistically. We also plan to reach out to local New York businesses for potential branding and product placement opportunities, since the events of the series take place in a specific place and time. This could help preserve costs and bring in additional funds for production.
We've also got some really great people who have already expressed interest in being involved. We think having these people on board will help generate publicity and anchor the production in a high regard for quality. The closer we get to our goal, the more likely we will be able to make sure these wonderful friends of ours will be able to be involved.

Only in recent years (2015-2017) has he at last turned his ideas and visions into reality with the help and collaboration of Branching Out Productions along many others behind the scenes.</p><p> </p><p>Production officially began on ""Windward Spirits: A New Ruler"" in December of 2015 and was filmed in May of 2016. Its follow up film, ""Windward Spirits: Blood Ties"" began production in September 2016 and filmed in January 2017 all through self and family funding . After a year long filming hiatus, the time has once again come to prep for the next film under Zubi Productions to round out the trilogy with ""Windward Spirits: On Deadly Grounds"" in collaboration with Nu Eyes Media and Rage Monkey Media. In this film we want to continue our story of these rich and mysterious characters and further capture the realm of Vanderia as these characters travel on through this harsh and unforgiving world.</p><p>For this to happen we need some help from you. Each and every contribution helps tremendously and we sincerely appreciate anything that you are able to assist with in helping this passion project once again come to life. We are currently setting our sights for the Fall of 2018.</p><p>Your Help</p><p>We are looking for a budget of approximately $20,000 for this next campaign to efficiently fulfill the production needs. This funding will cover:</p><p>Talent</p><p>Crew</p><p>Production Staff</p><p>Equipment</p><p>Set design</p><p>Location Expenses</p><p>Post Production</p><p>Music</p><p>Certainly, reaching this type of amount is challenging. As mentioned before however, any contribution is sincerely appreciated and will be used specifically for the vision of ""Windward Spirits: On Deadly Grounds"" even if our desired goal is not met. As proven before with our previous two award winning films of the series, we have the proper team in place to not only put this type of production together, but to execute it at its fullest potential with the resources we will have in place. </p><p>Giving Back</p><p>We most definitely would love to give back some perks for those of you who choose to help us in our venture. Some of the perks include:</p><p>Shout out on social media outlets via Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook</p><p>Windward Spirits T-shirts</p><p>Windward Spirits posters</p><p>Becoming an executive producer complete with IMDb credit</p><p>Living in the realm with us in a featured role in ""Windward Spirits: On Deadly Grounds"" complete with IMDb credit</p><p>Other Ways You Can Help</p><p>We are aware that some of you simply cannot contribute at this time. That certainly doesn't mean it has to end there. Another way you can help us out is by sharing and spreading the word. The more people who come in contact with our page, the better it is for the over all production. We still want you to be involved.

Only in recent years (2015-2017) has he at last turned his ideas and visions into reality with the help and collaboration of Branching Out Productions along many others behind the scenes. Production officially began on ""Windward Spirits: A New Ruler"" in December of 2015 and was filmed in May of 2016. Its follow up film, ""Windward Spirits: Blood Ties"" began production in September 2016 and filmed in January 2017 all through self and family funding . After a year long filming hiatus, the time has once again come to prep for the next film under Zubi Productions to round out the trilogy with ""Windward Spirits: On Deadly Grounds"" in collaboration with Nu Eyes Media and Rage Monkey Media. In this film we want to continue our story of these rich and mysterious characters and further capture the realm of Vanderia as these characters travel on through this harsh and unforgiving world.For this to happen we need some help from you. Each and every contribution helps tremendously and we sincerely appreciate anything that you are able to assist with in helping this passion project once again come to life. We are currently setting our sights for the Fall of 2018.Your HelpWe are looking for a budget of approximately $20,000 for this next campaign to efficiently fulfill the production needs. This funding will cover:TalentCrewProduction StaffEquipmentSet designLocation ExpensesPost ProductionMusicCertainly, reaching this type of amount is challenging. As mentioned before however, any contribution is sincerely appreciated and will be used specifically for the vision of ""Windward Spirits: On Deadly Grounds"" even if our desired goal is not met. As proven before with our previous two award winning films of the series, we have the proper team in place to not only put this type of production together, but to execute it at its fullest potential with the resources we will have in place. Giving BackWe most definitely would love to give back some perks for those of you who choose to help us in our venture. Some of the perks include:Shout out on social media outlets via Twitter, Instagram, and FacebookWindward Spirits T-shirtsWindward Spirits postersBecoming an executive producer complete with IMDb creditLiving in the realm with us in a featured role in ""Windward Spirits: On Deadly Grounds"" complete with IMDb creditOther Ways You Can HelpWe are aware that some of you simply cannot contribute at this time. That certainly doesn't mean it has to end there. Another way you can help us out is by sharing and spreading the word. The more people who come in contact with our page, the better it is for the over all production. We still want you to be involved.

In the far future an independent Scotland has begun conquering the stars.
Well it was all bound to go wrong sooner or later.
Scottish Space Federation: Chronicles of Yer Maw is an animated series that follows the exploits of Captain Danny McAndrew and his crew of hard-working layabouts aboard the eponymous federation battle-cruiser Yer Maw.
Perpetually drunk, easily distracted and with a brain capacity of a not-too-bright ten-year-old, Captain Danny is a continual thorn in the Scottish Space Federation's side. 
Yet their patience is wearing thin and assassination is beginning to appeal. 
Can the Yer Maw crew stay employed? Can they survive? And how much engine fuel is too much to drink?
The galaxy is turning Scottish and you're invited along for the ride.

<p><strong>Yesterday Will Hurt</strong> follows <strong>Joey Walker</strong>, a pessimistic, hot-headed, 17-year-old who suffers from frightening flashbacks from her childhood. She has no recollection of these memories and questions if they’re really her own. Joey wants nothing more than to leave town and start a new life with her inheritance once she turns 18. However, Joey’s legal guardians, her uncle Doug and aunt Heather, haven't stayed true to their promise. Joey’s fragmented memories begin to form a full picture when an unwanted visitor arrives with an ulterior motive. </p>

<p>Emily and Serafina started creating <strong>Yesterday Will Hurt</strong> when they were inspired by scenes in Breaking Bad, Ozark, and Sons of Anarchy. These scenes included traumatic fighting between adults, in the presence of an infant who was crying from being so frightened. These scenes made us think, “Would the infants present during filming of those scary scenes have any problems later in life?” This inspired us to create a unique story revolving around a character who was exposed to frightening horror scenes as an infant. Through Yesterday Will Hurt, we want to explore the human psyche and show the experience of someone struggling with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). It has become more common to see television characters that struggle with anxiety and depression, but PTSD is still under-represented in the media. Another character in Yesterday Will Hurt will exhibit signs of Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) in the more severe form as a psychopath. Hollywood frequently depicts psychopaths as serial killers but, though they lack empathy, the vast majority of them are not murderers. There are a lot of assumptions and misinformation about PTSD and ASPD that we want to break down in Yesterday Will Hurt. Through the series, we also want to create an awareness of the fear people have of addressing mental health issues. It is common for people of all ages, particularly teenagers, to push their problems aside and not get help. Our series will show a realistic portrayal of people dealing with these mental health issues and the paths they travel as they work through their personal barriers.</p>

<p>The greatest risk and challenge is the <strong>Covid-19 Pandemic</strong>.

<p> </p>
<p>From the <strong>multi-award-winning production company</strong> behind short films <i>Liberating Love  </i>and<i> The Better World...</i></p>
<p><strong><i>MISS WALKER </i>is a TV Concept about three Glasgow-based female actors experiencing the highs and lows of trying to “make it” in the Film/TV industry.</strong></p>
<p>It will bring audiences a <i>visually striking, socially relevant drama</i> that is <strong>strongly based on the experiences of many of our female colleagues and friends</strong> in the Film/TV industry. It follows their slow progression from outsiders to established actors over the course of three seasons.</p>
<p>The show is sort of a cross between <i>Call My Agent!</i> and <i>Not Another Happy Ending</i>. <strong>We aim to pitch the finished concept to international distributors, such as Channel 4, Netflix &amp; Amazon Prime.</strong></p>

<p>When you think of Scotland’s image in mainstream media…<i>what do you think of?</i></p>
<p>Let me guess: probably something to do with<strong> bagpipes</strong>,<strong> drugs</strong> and <strong>William Wallace slicing up Englishmen</strong>, right?</p>
<p>While there’s nothing necessarily wrong with these things, as a Scottish person,<i> it gets a bit tiresome when that’s <strong>ALL</strong> people think of.</i></p>
<p><strong>There is so much more to our country than that.</strong> We have incredible artistic heritage, from the stunning designs of Charles Rennie Mackintosh to the transcendent words of Robert Burns.</p>
<p><u><strong><i>That </i>is why we want to make <i>MISS WALKER</i>.</strong></u></p>
<p>A show about Scottish artists, with<i> a burning desire to make something of themselves</i> in spite of the struggles they face, the barriers that block their path.</p>
<p>While we may be taking on a highly ambitious task, we feel compelled to make <strong><i>MISS WALKER </i></strong>because our country has <strong><i>so</i></strong> <strong><i>much more to offer </i></strong>than just ""FREEDOM!"".</p>

</div></div>","WHAT Is MISS WALKER?

 
From the multi-award-winning production company behind short films Liberating Love  and The Better World...
MISS WALKER is a TV Concept about three Glasgow-based female actors experiencing the highs and lows of trying to “make it” in the Film/TV industry.
It will bring audiences a visually striking, socially relevant drama that is strongly based on the experiences of many of our female colleagues and friends in the Film/TV industry. It follows their slow progression from outsiders to established actors over the course of three seasons.
The show is sort of a cross between Call My Agent! and Not Another Happy Ending. We aim to pitch the finished concept to international distributors, such as Channel 4, Netflix & Amazon Prime.
 

WHY Are We Making MISS WALKER?


When you think of Scotland’s image in mainstream media…what do you think of?
Let me guess: probably something to do with bagpipes, drugs and William Wallace slicing up Englishmen, right?
While there’s nothing necessarily wrong with these things, as a Scottish person, it gets a bit tiresome when that’s ALL people think of.
There is so much more to our country than that. We have incredible artistic heritage, from the stunning designs of Charles Rennie Mackintosh to the transcendent words of Robert Burns.
That is why we want to make MISS WALKER.
A show about Scottish artists, with a burning desire to make something of themselves in spite of the struggles they face, the barriers that block their path.
While we may be taking on a highly ambitious task, we feel compelled to make MISS WALKER because our country has so much more to offer than just ""FREEDOM!"".
WITH YOUR BACKING and our team's talent, we believe that this goal is firmly within our grasp.
 

WHO Are We?


We are a team of highly-driven Scottish creatives, united and determined to bring this project to life in the most resonant way possible.
While our producer and director have been nominated for a combined SEVENTEEN awards in 2021 alone and our cast have acted in over a hundred feature films, adverts and short films between them, we all feel it's time to make the next step and create a serious project together that has the power to change how Scotland is perceived internationally.
CAST:

Annabel McCusker as LAUREN WALKER
Vivien Taylor as JESSICA MILLER
Lauren Wade as EMILY ALEXANDER
John McQuiston as JOHN MacKENZIE
Freya Anderson as SOPHIE MORRISON
Alice Gold as AMY SHAW
with  Robert Carr as JAMES DAY
and  Tony MacDonald as TERRY DOYLE

CREW:
Robin De Vernon Ryding - Creator & Director
Euan Brown - Producer
Allan Taylor - 1st Assistant Director
Bryan McIntyre - Sound
James Raeburn - Drone Operator
Jack McNeil - Lighting
Amy-Louise Ferguson - Make-Up Artist
Kirsty Joanne Kelly - First-Aid & Hairstylist
Sanne Gault - Photographer
Sonja Blietschau - Photographer
Hâle Denholm - Photographer


HOW Will The Funds Be Used?

The immediate allocations will be:

LOCATION FEES
SOUND
DRONE FOOTAGE
COVID PROOFING
TRAVEL & CATERING

The remaining will go towards covering the £1850 needed for VFX and – beyond that – towards securing A-List talent for the concept (more on that in the future)!
 

WHAT Will You Get For Donating To Our Campaign?


We are aware that the financial circumstances of many would-be donors are likely impacted in some way by the spread of COVID-19.
After a lot of consultation from our mentors, bouncing options off of our cast & crew members and doing a lot of reading, we decided to not to offer ANYTHING that isn’t giving some form of value back to our financiers.
We don’t want to just give you some overpriced t-shirt - it’s about providing value back to our community.
For £10, we give you an OFFICIAL MISS WALKER POSTCARD!
For £25, we THANK YOU IN THE CREDITS!
For £100, we will give you a SPEAKING ROLE IN THE CONCEPT (only 4 slots available)!

For £750, you will receive an ASSOCIATE PRODUCER CREDIT (only 5 slots available)!
For £3750, you will receive an EXECUTIVE PRODUCER CREDIT (only 3 slots available)!
The reason behind the producer fees is:
If we fill every Executive & Associate Producer slot, we raise:
(£3750x3) + (750x5) = £15000
This is our BEST-CASE SCENARIO. It would be enough capital to get significant A-List talent attached to the project, as well as fully cover the VFX we need and allow us to pay every single member of our cast & crew.

<h3>Help Bring A Vegan Comedy Series To Life!</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Charles Horn, an Emmy-nominated writer, and the creator of Zoe and Charles, a comedy webseries about two best friends who want to enjoy life and find love -- and want the world to go vegan!</p>
<p>I made a teaser to get things off the ground, but I need your help to create the series so that it can grow and grow with each episode, and eventually be developed into a mainstream TV show with a funny and positive animal rights message!  (The series will comedically explore dating and everyday life through the eyes of vegans.)  I have an entire first season that’s already written, amazing, and ready to go.  Let’s make it happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>I believe that comedy and entertainment is powerful, and can have a large positive impact on society.  Many TV shows have helped society evolve on important issues -- for example, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Cosby Show, Ellen, Will &amp; Grace, and Modern Family, to name a quick few.  I want Hollywood to create shows with positive animal rights messages.  I want Hollywood to be part of the solution, and I want to be professionally entertained all along the way.  So please spread the word and pledge what you can, but even if it’s just a dollar, you’re already helping Hollywood know that there’s an untapped market for this important issue.</p>
<h3>Is This Show Only For Vegans?</h3>
<p>No!  We’re making a general comedy show for a broad audience with anyone and everyone in mind, no matter where they’re currently at.  Our characters have the same human quirks and foibles as anyone else, but they just happen to also want a world where animals aren’t bred and killed for human pleasures. </p>
<p>We will always aim for material that can make anyone laugh, even if they’re currently disagreeing with it.  Sure, we have a definite point of view, just as any other show does, but we will always keep comedy as our focus.  You'll be vegan before you know it, anyway.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where Will The Money Go?</h3>
<p>After paying out crowdfunding fees and fulfilling donor awards, your pledges will be used to pay talent and crew, complete production of webisodes, hire professional marketing and PR, and do everything else needed to make and distribute a kick-ass show suitable for the mainstream public.</p>
<p>The initial goal will help pay for the production of a mini season (4 webisodes, 2-5 minutes each), our first stretch goal of $50,000 will help pay for the production of 10 webisodes, and our stretch goal of $100,000 will help us up the production value, approach famous actors for guest appearances, and complete an entire first season (20 webisodes) that’s already written, amazing, and ready to go.  Anything extra after that will be used for gender-neutral vegan hookers and blow!</p>
<h3>Who's Involved?</h3>
<p>I'm Charles Horn, the writer and creator of this series.  I’m an Emmy-nominated writer and producer with credits including <i>Fugget About It</i>, <i>Robot Chicken</i>, and <i>Robot Chicken: Star Wars</i>.  I’m also the author of the acclaimed book <a href=""http://amzn.to/1hArEiW"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Meat Logic: Why Do We Eat Animals?</i></a></p>
<p>The main characters of Zoe and Charles are being played by Tanya Zoeller and Andy Greene, two SAG actors with numerous credits.  Tanya studied acting in the US and London, and Andy is a graduate Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) improvisor.</p>
<h3>When Will It Come Out?</h3>
<p>Once funding is in place, we'll move into pre-production and aim to shoot in late 2017 or early 2018, and then finish post-production and have episodes ready beginning in May 2018.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks:</h3>
<p>Scripts are already written and ready to go, but given some of the subject matter involved, there is an acute risk of one or more of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting stranded on a desert island</li>
<li>Animals might go extinct and take over the world</li>
<li>We might discover we’re a lion</li>
<li>We might become the prime suspect in a plant murder investigation</li>
<li>Our bodies might tell us to take the money and run, and we always have to listen to our bodies</li>

Help Bring A Vegan Comedy Series To Life!
Hi, I'm Charles Horn, an Emmy-nominated writer, and the creator of Zoe and Charles, a comedy webseries about two best friends who want to enjoy life and find love -- and want the world to go vegan!
I made a teaser to get things off the ground, but I need your help to create the series so that it can grow and grow with each episode, and eventually be developed into a mainstream TV show with a funny and positive animal rights message!  (The series will comedically explore dating and everyday life through the eyes of vegans.)  I have an entire first season that’s already written, amazing, and ready to go.  Let’s make it happen!

Why?
I believe that comedy and entertainment is powerful, and can have a large positive impact on society.  Many TV shows have helped society evolve on important issues -- for example, The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Cosby Show, Ellen, Will & Grace, and Modern Family, to name a quick few.  I want Hollywood to create shows with positive animal rights messages.  I want Hollywood to be part of the solution, and I want to be professionally entertained all along the way.  So please spread the word and pledge what you can, but even if it’s just a dollar, you’re already helping Hollywood know that there’s an untapped market for this important issue.
Is This Show Only For Vegans?
No!  We’re making a general comedy show for a broad audience with anyone and everyone in mind, no matter where they’re currently at.  Our characters have the same human quirks and foibles as anyone else, but they just happen to also want a world where animals aren’t bred and killed for human pleasures.

<p>When Kate starts a free table in the laundry room in her apartment building the objects that are left there and taken from there end up taking us into the lives of the diverse tenants who live there. The table becomes a place of connection, community, expression and meaning. The building manager hates it.</p>
<p>The first season is 10 episodes. We have assembled a core cast, a cartoonist, a graphic artist, and an award winning director who are already committed to the project.</p>

<p><i><strong>A STORY OF THE AGES</strong></i></p>
<p>In the present age of heightened conspiracy, two men walk a fine line between grace and iniquity. With orders from high, Russ and Charlie, brothers of the cloth, take on their daily Commandments as operatives of The Watchtower, an organization as adept as it is unknown. Drawing from historical and socio-political moments, this series addresses the seriousness of the abysmal modern world, how it directly relates to the events of history, and how to traverse its changing landscape. With just the right amount of cheeky sarcastic banter, we watch two men grow from partners to brothers as they put their lives on the line to save humanity from its oldest and largest threat, itself. Help us bring Russ and Charlie off the page!</p>
<p><strong>LOGLINE:</strong> Missionaries or Mercenaries? Annoyingly polite or deceptively buff? Both? Definitely both.  Not the typical Witnesses, these two open wounds as much as they open doors.</p>
<p><strong>SYNOPSIS:</strong> Two trained operatives masquerade as door-to-door Jehovah’s Witnesses, sharing The Good Book by day, and cleansing the world of Sin by night. As part of the world’s most ancient and unknown order, The Watchtower, Russ must train the very first outside recruit, Charlie, in their mission protocols, as their daily Commandments give way to a higher calling.</p>

<p><i><strong>THE PERFECT PITCH</strong></i></p>
<p>The passion behind this project has grown immensely. Beginning as just a short, 12 page script, the now 55 page Pilot has garnered industry professionals, solidifying pitch meetings with large distributors in early August. The Pilot is accompanied by a full Bible presentation, equipped with  Budget and Top Sheets, Logline, Synopsis, Episode List, Summary (Season 2 &amp; 3), Script, Shot List, Schedules, Potential Distributors, as well as all the concepts footage, art, and story.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a large piece to bring together. Creating a pilot that has enough potential and promise typically costs hundreds of thousands of dollars, professionally millions. By combining a hands on practical sense to its fight scenes, this pilot has successfully created iterations with baseline variables and examples to showcase potential. In tandem with highly structured and scheduled professional choreography, a humble and extensive crew has banded together to see this piece through. From large executives and coordinators such as Jimmy Sharp Jr. and Oliver Young, as well as the many professionals like Erich Mingenbach and Duffy Taylor who set time and work aside on their series THIS IS US to see this through, we thank you.</li>
<li>Having been educated in Art and Business, creating a Series Pitch Bible was serendipitously fitting for O'Neil. Stocked full of the Box Office statistics, from Distributor Metrics through extensive cross analysis of previously successful series, For the Love of God shows exemplary promise. </li>
<li>Being raised in a religious mid western environment, O'Neil took each rule or commandment as an inquiry into reason. In this series, we dive into the ideas of creation and existence, and how Christianity and religion shaped the world just as much in Biblical times as it does in modern day, as well as some tribulations that may have been happening behind the holy curtain. This, all while addressing the very organized tactics of the worlds largest business, the Church.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Here's the grit.</p>
<p>For this piece, we need <strong>$45,000</strong> to showcase a potent concept!</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>HELP US REACH OUR GOAL OF $45,000!</strong></h2>
<p>This is where that budget goes:</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Production</strong>: This includes development, location scouting, casting, contracts, insurance &amp; permits. This is the gritty work that has to be strategically planned to encompass the entirety of everything that will happen on the shoot. All of these are essential to a professional piece, ensuring the production has followed through proper legal guidelines. Remember the 5P's: Proper Preparation Prevents Poor Performance. This portion typically takes up about 15% of the total budget.</p>
<p><strong>Production</strong>: Any an all confines of shooting days! This is where the bulk of the budget goes. All equipment (camera rentals and sound packages, electrical equipment/lighting, etc.), set design, character wardrobe, <strong>crew labor</strong>, craft services and food, hair and make-up, the works. We have a great and humble crew, all working for drastically less than their rates because of the promise and vision they have in the concept, in hopes of working together to further the careers of everyone involved. Taking the majority of the budget, this will account for approximately 75% of the total.</p>
<p><strong>Post-Production:</strong> Editing, sound mixing, ADR, color correction, visual effects, sound effects and music are some of the great many things that must come together to create the final piece. These seemingly overlooked pieces can be the defining value of what makes or brakes a good piece. </p>
<p><strong>INVESTMENTS and DONATIONS:</strong></p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal we still have meetings! Simply following a breakdown of the schedule, a reallocation of resources and a restructuring allows to shoot less than the full pilot, but far more than just a few scenes. Scheduled for the beginning of August, Pitch meetings with large networks and distributors have been scheduled to showcase, so regardless of whether we have a full 55 minutes pilot, we will have a lot to present! </p>
</div><div>
<p>As an investor you would help bring this piece to life.</p>
<p>We do have original Investors and Producers, but in order to make our goal, we just need a bit more help! A contribution could be in the form of: </p>
<ul>

<li>BECOMING A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTOR</li>
<li>BECOMING A PRODUCER</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<p>We have worked very hard for the past year and a half to put together an industry standard equivalent, even with such a low budget. The potential and possibilities for this piece are endless. There is no promise or guarantee, but there is sometimes luck. Luck is what happens when hard work meets opportunity, and opportunity came knocking. We thank you for taking the time and we appreciate any help you have to give!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi there, </p>
<p>Gabriel Carrubba and Victoria Thompson here from the team at <i>Viceroy Pictures</i>. </p>
<p>'<i>White Teeth</i>' is a Psychological, Original Web Series Drama about coming of age as a teenager in modern-day suburban Australia. It's a story about guilt, identity, confusion, responsibility, and feeling as if you had the weight of the entire world stacked on your shoulders. That feeling of never ending anxiety and regret while battling with the secret that lays deep within the pit of your stomach, constantly itching at your conscience - all while having to deal with the consequences of your actions.</p>
<p>Through our exploration of television and cinema, we've often found ourselves taking a liking to stories about youth and coming of age. Many of our previous conversations have revolved around our High School experiences and how different they were for the both of us. However, regardless of our differences, we both came to the same conclusion of wishing that there was a television show about Australian teenagers, with relatable characters that we could have watched growing up. It would have saved us both a world of confusion knowing that we weren't the only ones facing the awkward issues and situations that teenagers often find themselves in.</p>
<p>Two television shows in particular that inspired us to write '<i>White Teeth</i>' are; '<i>Puberty Blues</i>' (2012-2013), '<i>13 Reasons Why</i>' (2017). The reason for this is purely because of how accurate they are in telling the stories of teenagers truthfully. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502247656/xt3tcy7vmknwddstax8b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Synopsis</strong></h3>
</div><div><p>Six teenagers attempt to navigate their way through high school after a fatal car accident that has turned their world upside-down. The truth begins to unravel as they attempt to battle with internal guilt, confusion, responsibility, anxiety and regret – all while having to deal with the consequences of their actions - their conscience remains tainted.</p></div><div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>As the series will deal with the themes of mental health, drug use and sexual situations, we plan on reaching out to organisations such as; <i>Beyond Blue</i>, <i>Headspace</i> and <i>The Line </i>as we want to spread the word of the series so more and more teenagers can get around to seeing it.</p>
<p>In regards to this project, diversity is a key for us. Many of our characters come from different cultural backgrounds and beliefs, providing a realistic Australian, Public High School experience. </p>
<h3>Our Plan</h3>
<p><i>'White Teeth'</i> will run as an original web series for 6 episodes, running at the duration of 12 minutes per episode. Each episode will be told through the perspective of one of the six teenagers as they experience the before, during and after of the accident. It will feature on the '<i>Viceroy Pictures'</i> <i>YouTube </i>channel. The first episode will be filmed in October and will be uploaded in December. The other five episodes will be filmed from February-May and will be released in August-September.</p>
<p>As this is <i>Viceroy's</i> first production, this is required to prove ourselves in the industry and build an audience. </p>
<p>In the future, we plan on extending the series to 6 x 1 hour episodes. This will only happen if it is picked up and distributed by a larger streaming company. In order to do this, we need your help to make the web series possible! </p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Hi there, 
Gabriel Carrubba and Victoria Thompson here from the team at Viceroy Pictures. 
'White Teeth' is a Psychological, Original Web Series Drama about coming of age as a teenager in modern-day suburban Australia. It's a story about guilt, identity, confusion, responsibility, and feeling as if you had the weight of the entire world stacked on your shoulders. That feeling of never ending anxiety and regret while battling with the secret that lays deep within the pit of your stomach, constantly itching at your conscience - all while having to deal with the consequences of your actions.
Through our exploration of television and cinema, we've often found ourselves taking a liking to stories about youth and coming of age. Many of our previous conversations have revolved around our High School experiences and how different they were for the both of us. However, regardless of our differences, we both came to the same conclusion of wishing that there was a television show about Australian teenagers, with relatable characters that we could have watched growing up. It would have saved us both a world of confusion knowing that we weren't the only ones facing the awkward issues and situations that teenagers often find themselves in.
Two television shows in particular that inspired us to write 'White Teeth' are; 'Puberty Blues' (2012-2013), '13 Reasons Why' (2017). The reason for this is purely because of how accurate they are in telling the stories of teenagers truthfully. 

Synopsis
Six teenagers attempt to navigate their way through high school after a fatal car accident that has turned their world upside-down. The truth begins to unravel as they attempt to battle with internal guilt, confusion, responsibility, anxiety and regret – all while having to deal with the consequences of their actions - their conscience remains tainted.
Impact
As the series will deal with the themes of mental health, drug use and sexual situations, we plan on reaching out to organisations such as; Beyond Blue, Headspace and The Line as we want to spread the word of the series so more and more teenagers can get around to seeing it.
In regards to this project, diversity is a key for us. Many of our characters come from different cultural backgrounds and beliefs, providing a realistic Australian, Public High School experience. 
Our Plan
'White Teeth' will run as an original web series for 6 episodes, running at the duration of 12 minutes per episode. Each episode will be told through the perspective of one of the six teenagers as they experience the before, during and after of the accident. It will feature on the 'Viceroy Pictures' YouTube channel. The first episode will be filmed in October and will be uploaded in December. The other five episodes will be filmed from February-May and will be released in August-September.
As this is Viceroy's first production, this is required to prove ourselves in the industry and build an audience. 
In the future, we plan on extending the series to 6 x 1 hour episodes. This will only happen if it is picked up and distributed by a larger streaming company. In order to do this, we need your help to make the web series possible!

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<p><strong><i>DIY Community Changers, LLC, </i></strong>will create awareness about self-community care by filming and highlighting community agents who represent the idea that it is not necessary to wait for someone else to make a difference in your own community, you can do it yourself.</p>

<p>I'm Kyle Mackesey. I'm a jack of many trades and a proud Massachusetts Townie. For the past seven plus years I have been learning the craft of building hand- puppets along with writing comedy, building sets, drawing, lighting, video and audio work. Now that I have assembled a quorum for performance production I am ready to bring my puppet, Townie, comedy webseries: Sonkhonkett, to the wider world. This fictional town lies where the Rumney Marsh takes up Boston's North Shore towns of Revere and Saugus. The webseries aims to capture the local persona of the region, the Townie. Being one myself, we are a unique people that I feel is either overlooked or misrepresented in popular culture. For me there is no better way to parlay information than humor. I meticulous sculpt and gather jokes and comedic structures I feel capture the Massachusetts style of comedy. The show is ADULT (Not for children), ball-busting and fearless but done out of great love for the land that has shaped my ways and spirit.</p>
<p>Many hours, days, weeks, months and years has been invested into this town I call Sonkhonkett. Laying out every street of the town which you can check out at <a href=""http://www.sonkhonkett.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sonkhonkett.com/</a>  and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sonkhonkett/,researching"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/sonkhonkett/</a> , researching North Shore history and creating the town's own lineage, building sets and figuring out how to film has pushed this project to it's next evolution. There are shorts on Youtube, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/user/skaskaskadank/videos"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/user/skaskaskadank/videos</a> , called ""Sonkhonkett Samplers"" that introduce the viewer to the world of this town.  They start out with limited production value but as time progressed over these past 3 years we have a DSLR camera, a variety of sets and props, better audio and better lighting.</p>
<p>We hosted two fundraisers in the last  two years where we reached on average 180% of our target goal. The first fundraiser funded the people and equipment to make the Sonking Pilot Episode and the second just went towards paying the performers, artists, craftsmen and laborers. This year we are continuing to have 90% of the funds allocated to all the people that make Sonkhonkett possible.</p>
<p>Sonkhonkett is about fun anthropology in a Squidbillies / Trailer Park Boys sort of manner but Sonkhonkett is more than that. I can't do Sonkhonkett without collaboration. My collaborators come from a variety of backgrounds and they kill at what they do. I want Sonkhonkett to become a production company that pays people for what they are worth. I, like many others who ""Sonk The Honk"" are artists and more often than not our work is rarely paid appropriately or even at all. Artists are skilled, passionate folk that deserve better. But this also applies to all workers. As the cost of living goes up and wages either stagnate or decrease many people struggle to survive and live a happy life. This production will not just need puppeteers, videographers, painters, sculptors but accountants, janitors, marketing folk, software engineers and you name it. We would like this $550 to act as an investment to forward us in the direction of creating a company that is fair to its workers. A company that will stay local to portray what is local because we got what no other state has got. GO MASSACHUSETTS!</p>

Laying out every street of the town which you can check out at http://www.sonkhonkett.com/  and https://www.facebook.com/sonkhonkett/ , researching North Shore history and creating the town's own lineage, building sets and figuring out how to film has pushed this project to it's next evolution. There are shorts on Youtube, https://www.youtube.com/user/skaskaskadank/videos , called ""Sonkhonkett Samplers"" that introduce the viewer to the world of this town.  They start out with limited production value but as time progressed over these past 3 years we have a DSLR camera, a variety of sets and props, better audio and better lighting.
We hosted two fundraisers in the last  two years where we reached on average 180% of our target goal. The first fundraiser funded the people and equipment to make the Sonking Pilot Episode and the second just went towards paying the performers, artists, craftsmen and laborers. This year we are continuing to have 90% of the funds allocated to all the people that make Sonkhonkett possible.
Sonkhonkett is about fun anthropology in a Squidbillies / Trailer Park Boys sort of manner but Sonkhonkett is more than that. I can't do Sonkhonkett without collaboration. My collaborators come from a variety of backgrounds and they kill at what they do. I want Sonkhonkett to become a production company that pays people for what they are worth. I, like many others who ""Sonk The Honk"" are artists and more often than not our work is rarely paid appropriately or even at all. Artists are skilled, passionate folk that deserve better. But this also applies to all workers. As the cost of living goes up and wages either stagnate or decrease many people struggle to survive and live a happy life. This production will not just need puppeteers, videographers, painters, sculptors but accountants, janitors, marketing folk, software engineers and you name it. We would like this $550 to act as an investment to forward us in the direction of creating a company that is fair to its workers. A company that will stay local to portray what is local because we got what no other state has got. GO MASSACHUSETTS!",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>Apartment Sessions is... </h3>
<p>a Brooklyn-based multimedia artist collective. Our family is growing everyday, with over 200 artists joining us to date. Through our videos and performances, we aim to bring back the natural communal element that music holds in everyone's hearts. Check out our <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xh6QX39vsIg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Season 2 Finale video</a> to get inside the Apartment Sessions spirit. </p>
<p>As our community has grown, we have moved outside of The Apartment to push the boundaries of collaborative art, culturally and geographically. We have filmed outdoor and unconventional sessions here in the US; on the subway, on a lake, on rooves and in backyards. Now we are headed north, over the Atlantic Ocean and into the surreal landscapes of Iceland. </p>

<h3>Why Iceland?</h3>
<p>When Apartment Sessions looked to expand our community around the globe, Iceland was the obvious choice. From black sand beaches to jagged cliffs to cascading waterfalls, the country's geographic features are one of a kind on our planet.

<h3>What will we be doing? </h3>
<p>We will be recording at least one session per day at various indoor and outdoor locations, backdropped against glaciers, waterfalls, and endless horizons. We'll be arranging existing songs, featuring Apartment Sessions musicians' original songs, and collaborating with Icelandic musicians (and dancers and visual artists!). Sessions will range from just a few people to the entire crew of nearly 40 musicians. We will also be performing as various groups around the country. Stay tuned for updates as specific sessions and performances get planned! </p>
<p>All of these videos will be publicly released on our <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/apartmentsessions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Youtube channel</a> over the course of 2019.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; challenges</h3>
<p>This trip comes with plenty of intrinsic challenges that we feel Apartment Sessions is uniquely qualified to overcome.</p>
<p>Navigating a foreign country with a large amount of people is a logistical hardship no matter what you're doing, but doing so with a group of musicians on a tight working schedule is even more of a challenge. However, Apartment Sessions has been practicing pulling off near-impossible schedules and organizational feats since our inception. We are well-versed in adapting on the fly and making sure that our end goals are met.   </p>
<p>Recording outside is a challenge in itself, and the ever-changing weather of Iceland presents its own obstacles. We will be working with a <a href=""http://www.sunlabstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">solar-powered energy rig</a> to power outdoor sessions. If this all sounds farfetched to you, that's entirely fair; the entire history of Apartment Sessions is one of slowly moving ideas from the realm of the absurd to the realm of the real. We are confident that we have the improvisational skills to overcome any and all challenges that will inevitably arise on this adventure. </p>

<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>

<h3>The Mission</h3>
<p>Can you have an adventure travelling to the Isle of Man without travelling all the way to a far off country like Mexico? I suggested you can - and Lady Felicity was sceptical! So for our second travel adventure documentary, we will be packing our bags and heading to the Isle of Man. Starting with a performance of one of my shows at the Studio Theatre in Douglas, we will then travel around the Island for a week as I prove to Lady Felicity that there is so much adventure on offer there!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Having just started in travel documentary film making with our Mexico video, we have learned a lot of lessons, and there is a lot that we can improve on with every video. My main concern going forward is sound, and so some of the money we raise on our main target will go towards a few improvements in sound recording equipment. We have already invested in a new on-camera microphone, but to really take our documentaries to the level we want - and to allow a lot more freedom when shooting to allow us a wider choice of shots, we also want to get some quality wireless lapel microphones. Obviously, these will not just be used for this project, but will also be used for all of our future videos (and for fans of our Steampunk web series 'The Last Airship', they will cross over into that as well). So for the sake of both this video and future videos, we want to make sure that we get the best quality microphones that we can afford. This will account for approximately £300 of our main budget - although if we exceed our stretch goals, this will be a lot more!</p>
<p>Most of the money we receive from our main target, however, will be seen on the screen! The actual basics of the trip itself - the flights, accommodation and car hire - will be paid for either with ticket sales from my show and/or by deals and direct sponsorship we can arrange with the suppliers of those - we are not crowdfunding for you to just pay for us to have a holiday. </p>
<p>I have big plans for things I would like to do while we are on the Isle of Man. Although I don't want to go into too much detail on here (as Lady Felicity will, of course, see this page, and part of the point of the venture is that she should go into it with as little foreknowledge as possible),  suffice to say that we will be wanting to get into the water - this is a major part of adventuring for Felicity. We will (hopefully) both have finished our scuba diving certifications before this trip, so that is likely to form part of what we do. I will also be talking to various places and people on the Island to try to arrange some experiences that take us beyond the general tourist views of certain attractions, and will also be talking to local experts in certain fields about appearing in the video.</p>
<p>All of these things cost money, and our aim is to show the Isle of Man in the best possible light - and our initial target of £1500 for this project is a low-level target which we will have to use wisely to get the best possible results we can.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be great to go over our initial target and reach our stretch goals - these ones are also aimed at improving not only this particular adventure documentary but also all of our future ones (and all of our other videos) - so if you enjoyed our Mexico video and want lots more adventures to watch, or just want our video showing the Isle of Man to be even more incredible, help us reach a little further if you can!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stretch Goal 1: £2500 (total) - One of the biggest problems we had with the Mexico video was with the edit. The computer we use for editing really wasn't designed for the task, and so it took a lot longer than it should have and made it very difficult to edit in real-time. If we reach this stretch goal it will allow us to buy a laptop specially designed for the task of editing. The reason we want to go with a laptop rather than a desktop for this purpose is to allow us to put together rough cuts of each day's events each evening. This will not only speed up the time between filming and release, but it will also allow us on occasion to go back and pick up extra shots if necessary where timing allows.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stretch Goal 2: £3000 (total) - If we reach this level, the additional £500 will have a very simple purpose - to allow us to promote the documentary, and to enter it into film festivals and competitions around the world to spread both this film and the Isle of Man as far as possible!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Stretch Goal 3 - To infinity and beyond! - If we get beyond this level, everything will go towards the project. There are 'dream' ideas we'd like to include in the project if we have the funds, and 'dream' equipment we would like to purchase if we could. We're not daring to expect to go this big on this first funding attempt for one of our travel documentaries, however - but if we look like we're getting close to Stretch Goal 2, we'll be a bit more specific about where we can go from here!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As our second travel documentary, this one means a lot to us, and so, of course, we want to get it right! Our aim with these videos is to show a genuine adventure - so we are honest - but at the same time to show the places we visit in the best possible light. We want our videos to inspire people to travel to the places we visit!</p>
<p>In its first two weeks, our Mexico video was seen by over 2500 people on YouTube (we'll try to keep an idea of the current figure on this page), and this is just a start as we are learning the art of promoting it to as large an audience as possible. More to the point, here are some of the comments left on the video from some of the people who have seen it so far:</p>
<p>""The Mayan ruins look awesome - they look fascinating. I hope you get the chance to share more adventures like this with us.""</p>
<p>""What an amazing adventure - a true spectacle and wonderfully presented.""</p>
<p>""What a fantastic video. Supremely jealous, as I would love to go there.""</p>
<p>""What a fantastic summary of your adventure in Mexico. If I ever get out there I would love to see the whales and do the swimming with the sharks and sea lions.""</p>
<p>We think that this shows that people clearly have a taste for what we do - but also that the film clearly makes the country the star!</p>
<p>I know that from what I have seen of the Isle of Man, and from what I am currently researching, that between us all we can create an adventure that not only makes Lady Felicity concede that you can have a perfectly good adventure without going all around the world, but will also encourage other people to come and have their own adventures!</p>
<p>So, to enjoy another adventure from us, and to help us share the Isle of Man with many more people, please consider helping us out!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks, but in this project, they are very few. What would happen if we didn't reach our full goal? Well, I still have a show on the Isle of Man, we'll still be flying over and staying there, so the bottom line is that we will still be filming a video. However, we want this film to be incredible - so the closer we get to our goal, or the more goals we exceed, the better the final result will be!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know that not everyone will be in a position to help us out with funding - and thank you for coming over to this page!</p>
<p>There is still a lot you can do to help. Please let other people know about this campaign - share the link around anywhere you can! Also, be sure to watch, comment, and subscribe to the Mexico film on YouTube - the more success we have with that, the easier it will be to get our Isle of Man film out to a larger number of people!</p>

All of these things cost money, and our aim is to show the Isle of Man in the best possible light - and our initial target of £1500 for this project is a low-level target which we will have to use wisely to get the best possible results we can.
Of course, it would be great to go over our initial target and reach our stretch goals - these ones are also aimed at improving not only this particular adventure documentary but also all of our future ones (and all of our other videos) - so if you enjoyed our Mexico video and want lots more adventures to watch, or just want our video showing the Isle of Man to be even more incredible, help us reach a little further if you can!
 
Stretch Goal 1: £2500 (total) - One of the biggest problems we had with the Mexico video was with the edit. The computer we use for editing really wasn't designed for the task, and so it took a lot longer than it should have and made it very difficult to edit in real-time. If we reach this stretch goal it will allow us to buy a laptop specially designed for the task of editing. The reason we want to go with a laptop rather than a desktop for this purpose is to allow us to put together rough cuts of each day's events each evening. This will not only speed up the time between filming and release, but it will also allow us on occasion to go back and pick up extra shots if necessary where timing allows.
 
Stretch Goal 2: £3000 (total) - If we reach this level, the additional £500 will have a very simple purpose - to allow us to promote the documentary, and to enter it into film festivals and competitions around the world to spread both this film and the Isle of Man as far as possible!
 
Stretch Goal 3 - To infinity and beyond! - If we get beyond this level, everything will go towards the project. There are 'dream' ideas we'd like to include in the project if we have the funds, and 'dream' equipment we would like to purchase if we could. We're not daring to expect to go this big on this first funding attempt for one of our travel documentaries, however - but if we look like we're getting close to Stretch Goal 2, we'll be a bit more specific about where we can go from here!
 

The Impact
As our second travel documentary, this one means a lot to us, and so, of course, we want to get it right! Our aim with these videos is to show a genuine adventure - so we are honest - but at the same time to show the places we visit in the best possible light. We want our videos to inspire people to travel to the places we visit!
In its first two weeks, our Mexico video was seen by over 2500 people on YouTube (we'll try to keep an idea of the current figure on this page), and this is just a start as we are learning the art of promoting it to as large an audience as possible. More to the point, here are some of the comments left on the video from some of the people who have seen it so far:
""The Mayan ruins look awesome - they look fascinating. I hope you get the chance to share more adventures like this with us.""
""What an amazing adventure - a true spectacle and wonderfully presented.""
""What a fantastic video. Supremely jealous, as I would love to go there.""
""What a fantastic summary of your adventure in Mexico. If I ever get out there I would love to see the whales and do the swimming with the sharks and sea lions.""
We think that this shows that people clearly have a taste for what we do - but also that the film clearly makes the country the star!
I know that from what I have seen of the Isle of Man, and from what I am currently researching, that between us all we can create an adventure that not only makes Lady Felicity concede that you can have a perfectly good adventure without going all around the world, but will also encourage other people to come and have their own adventures!
So, to enjoy another adventure from us, and to help us share the Isle of Man with many more people, please consider helping us out!
 

Risks & Challenges
There are always risks, but in this project, they are very few. What would happen if we didn't reach our full goal? Well, I still have a show on the Isle of Man, we'll still be flying over and staying there, so the bottom line is that we will still be filming a video. However, we want this film to be incredible - so the closer we get to our goal, or the more goals we exceed, the better the final result will be!

Other Ways You Can Help
I know that not everyone will be in a position to help us out with funding - and thank you for coming over to this page!
There is still a lot you can do to help. Please let other people know about this campaign - share the link around anywhere you can! Also, be sure to watch, comment, and subscribe to the Mexico film on YouTube - the more success we have with that, the easier it will be to get our Isle of Man film out to a larger number of people!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<i>Hooked è una black comedy a narrazione seriale. Atmosfere umide, relazioni umane claustrofobiche e dialoghi politicamente scorretti fanno da sfondo ad una vicenda grottesca ed intricata dalle ampie possibilità di sviluppo.</i> </h3><p>I protagonisti rappresentano per iperboli la marginalità della condizione umana degli attuali 30enni, delineandone quindi emblematicamente i confini: tossicodipendenti disinteressati al proprio futuro, lavoratori frustrati in cerca di gratificazione, extracomunitari in fuga dagli stereotipi. </p><p>La scrittura alterna ritmi e stili variegati che – lungi dallo stridere l’uno con l’altro – si completano sinergicamente nella creazione di un immaginario narrativo complesso e realistico, in cui il ruvido slang della strada si fonde efficacemente con un nozionismo farmacologico asettico e di valenza informativa, attenta però a non veicolare una compiaciuta esaltazione della tematica della droga. Hooked sfrutta invece il background dissoluto dei protagonisti per restituirlo allo spettatore in uno storytelling caleidoscopico, impreziosito da trovate estetiche tanto suggestive quanto visionarie. </p><p><i>Hooked is a black comedy series.

Una ragazza con indosso un abito da sera scadente trema e sbava convulsa sul ciglio d'una strada statale. Sono le 04:00 di mattina e ad impedirle di trasformarsi in un irrilevante trafiletto di cronaca locale ci sono solo due balordi; ma le probabilità di salvare qualcuno dalla morte per abuso di stupefacenti si assottigliano ulteriormente se quelle sostanze le hai assunte anche tu. Più nello specifico: le probabilità tendono a zero se di quelle sostanze sei strafatto come un balordo cavallo dopato.La ragazza abita in periferia. Trascinarcela incosciente ha comportato un dispiegamento coordinato di sforzo fisico e arguzie intellettive francamente sorprendente, specie se si considera l’infima caratura dei due individui in questione. Scoprono tuttavia che l’alloggio non le appartiene; pare che la ragazza lavori come badante di un’anziana signora che scorrazza incauta tra le eleganti e impolverate stanze della sua dimora signorile, animata da quella sincera allegria che solo la demenza senile può regalare.In un sistema chiuso privo di informazioni, la presenza di una montagna di soldi nel cesso della vecchia in questione può condizionare considerevolmente la capacità di giudizio.Hooked è una black-comedy.In a closed system with no information, environmental circumstances can have an impact on the ability of judgement.A girl wearing a poor quality dress shivers and drools at the edge of a highway. It is 4am and two morons are trying to prevent this to become part of the news, but the chances to rescue someone’s from overdose become smaller and smaller if you take the same substances. To be more precise: chances get close to zero if you are as high as a doped horse.The girl lives in the suburbs. Dragging her there while she in unconscious requires a surprising combination of physical effort and wit, especially if we think about the caliber of the two characters. They finally find out that the house does not belong to the girl: she is the nurse for a senile lady that incautiously romps about the elegant and dusty rooms of her refined abode.In a closed system with no information, the presence of a huge amount of money in the loo of this old lady can considerably influence the ability of judgement.Hooked is a black comedy. I Personaggi
Hooked è una black comedy a narrazione seriale. Atmosfere umide, relazioni umane claustrofobiche e dialoghi politicamente scorretti fanno da sfondo ad una vicenda grottesca ed intricata dalle ampie possibilità di sviluppo. I protagonisti rappresentano per iperboli la marginalità della condizione umana degli attuali 30enni, delineandone quindi emblematicamente i confini: tossicodipendenti disinteressati al proprio futuro, lavoratori frustrati in cerca di gratificazione, extracomunitari in fuga dagli stereotipi. La scrittura alterna ritmi e stili variegati che – lungi dallo stridere l’uno con l’altro – si completano sinergicamente nella creazione di un immaginario narrativo complesso e realistico, in cui il ruvido slang della strada si fonde efficacemente con un nozionismo farmacologico asettico e di valenza informativa, attenta però a non veicolare una compiaciuta esaltazione della tematica della droga. Hooked sfrutta invece il background dissoluto dei protagonisti per restituirlo allo spettatore in uno storytelling caleidoscopico, impreziosito da trovate estetiche tanto suggestive quanto visionarie. Hooked is a black comedy series.

<h3><strong>WHAT IS “LEA THE LATE BLOOMER”?</strong></h3>
<p>“Lea The Late Bloomer” is a dramedy web series written and created by myself, Kadia Blagrove.Here’s a quick synopsis: She’s almost 30. She’s broke. She lives with her parents. She’s “Lea The Late Bloomer.” In this new original web series, we follow 28-year-old Lea Watson, an underachieving filmmaker whose dream is to make it big (or at least get verified on the ‘gram). After a failed attempt at “making it”  in Los Angeles, Lea returns home to The Bronx to live with her parents, and is forced to face her old demons and self-sabotaging behavior.</p>
<p>Also, fun fact: <i>Leo the Late Bloomer</i> was one of my favorite books as a kid, so the title is somewhat of an homage. </p>
<p><strong>We released our first episode, just to give a taste, you can watch it below. (With your help we can improve audio and color quality!)</strong></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5zQUhIp_NhQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div> <h3><strong>COOL. SO WHY DID YOU WRITE IT?</strong></h3>
<p>I wrote “Lea The Late Bloomer” for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Because maybe you relate:</strong> Sometimes it can feel like everyone else has got it all figured out but you. Living in a world where we’re constantly exposed to the successes, joys, and achievements of friends and strangers, it’s easy to find yourself comparing your insides to everyone’s outsides. I wanted to speak to that.</li>
<li>
<strong>Because we don’t need to “have it all before 30”: </strong>There’s so much pressure put on young people to become rich and successful (whatever that means to you) by a certain age. It can be so damaging on one’s self-esteem and mental health. It’s not just a “millennial thing” either. Whether you are 25 or 45, society can really make you feel inadequate based on external factors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Because we need a variety of Black women characters:</strong> I love me some diversity! And while we are seeing more people of color and identities on screen, their narratives are still so very limited. Black women characters are either super overachiever boss queens or tragic tortured souls  — what about the regular-degular-shmegular girls from The Bronx? (Shout out to Cardi B!)</li>
</ul> <h3><strong>I DIG IT!  SO HOW CAN I HELP?</strong></h3>
<p>So glad you asked! “Lea The Late Bloomer” is really a labor of love. Equipment costs, locations rentals, food costs, transportation costs, and every cent put into production came from my own pockets.  I am so very grateful for the generosity of my crew and cast who shared time and talents with me for free, as well as the few local locations who allowed us to film in their space at no cost at all!  Now that we are in the post-production stage, we are raising funds to help us pay for top-notch editing, fees for film festival competitions to get more eyes on the show, and the means to kickstart our Season 2. We released our trailer in January and received an outpour of excitement and support. Folks really connected to the story and want to see “Lea The Late Bloomer” come to life. With your donation, we can make that happen!</p> <h3>LOVE IT! SO WHERE WILL IT AIR?</h3>
<p>You can find “Lea The Late Bloomer” on <a href=""https://youtu.be/5zQUhIp_NhQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube</a> and IGTv. Be sure to follow us on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/leathelatebloomerseries/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram (@LeaTheLateBloomerSeries)</a> too for snippets, sketches, and sneak-peeks.</p> <h3>I’M SO INTO THIS AND I WANT TO LEARN MORE. GO AHEAD AND TELL ME MORE.</h3>

</div></div>","WHAT IS “LEA THE LATE BLOOMER”?
“Lea The Late Bloomer” is a dramedy web series written and created by myself, Kadia Blagrove.Here’s a quick synopsis: She’s almost 30. She’s broke. She lives with her parents. She’s “Lea The Late Bloomer.” In this new original web series, we follow 28-year-old Lea Watson, an underachieving filmmaker whose dream is to make it big (or at least get verified on the ‘gram). After a failed attempt at “making it”  in Los Angeles, Lea returns home to The Bronx to live with her parents, and is forced to face her old demons and self-sabotaging behavior.
Also, fun fact: Leo the Late Bloomer was one of my favorite books as a kid, so the title is somewhat of an homage. 
We released our first episode, just to give a taste, you can watch it below. (With your help we can improve audio and color quality!)
 COOL. SO WHY DID YOU WRITE IT?
I wrote “Lea The Late Bloomer” for a few reasons:


Because maybe you relate: Sometimes it can feel like everyone else has got it all figured out but you. Living in a world where we’re constantly exposed to the successes, joys, and achievements of friends and strangers, it’s easy to find yourself comparing your insides to everyone’s outsides. I wanted to speak to that.

Because we don’t need to “have it all before 30”: There’s so much pressure put on young people to become rich and successful (whatever that means to you) by a certain age. It can be so damaging on one’s self-esteem and mental health. It’s not just a “millennial thing” either. Whether you are 25 or 45, society can really make you feel inadequate based on external factors.

Because we need a variety of Black women characters: I love me some diversity! And while we are seeing more people of color and identities on screen, their narratives are still so very limited. Black women characters are either super overachiever boss queens or tragic tortured souls  — what about the regular-degular-shmegular girls from The Bronx? (Shout out to Cardi B!)
 I DIG IT!  SO HOW CAN I HELP?
So glad you asked! “Lea The Late Bloomer” is really a labor of love. Equipment costs, locations rentals, food costs, transportation costs, and every cent put into production came from my own pockets.  I am so very grateful for the generosity of my crew and cast who shared time and talents with me for free, as well as the few local locations who allowed us to film in their space at no cost at all!  Now that we are in the post-production stage, we are raising funds to help us pay for top-notch editing, fees for film festival competitions to get more eyes on the show, and the means to kickstart our Season 2. We released our trailer in January and received an outpour of excitement and support. Folks really connected to the story and want to see “Lea The Late Bloomer” come to life. With your donation, we can make that happen! LOVE IT! SO WHERE WILL IT AIR?
You can find “Lea The Late Bloomer” on YouTube and IGTv. Be sure to follow us on Instagram (@LeaTheLateBloomerSeries) too for snippets, sketches, and sneak-peeks. I’M SO INTO THIS AND I WANT TO LEARN MORE. GO AHEAD AND TELL ME MORE.
Thank you so much for making it this far! Keep reading to learn more about my creative mission and the hardworking cast and crew behind the show! THE CREW Kadia Blagrove, Writer/Creator/Executive Producer

Kadia Blagrove is a Jamaican-American writer and author for all things life and culture. For nearly a decade, the Bronx native has used her gift of storytelling to help diversify the imagery of people of color — particularly Black women. Her thoughtful and conversational pieces have been published and discussed in several publications including HuffPost, Jezebel, Cosmopolitan, Bustle, Thought Catalog, Complex, and more. For her screenwriting debut, Blagrove presents “Lea The Late Bloomer.” Remy Fink, Director

He is the creator of ""$5.00 Shorts"" (a bi-weekly series of short films each made for under $5.00), and has also directed music videos and branded content.

Raven Irabor is her environment, generation, race, gender, education level, culture, city, family, and consumptions. All of these things are pieces of her holistic experience that has influenced the way she views the world. Using visual art as her primary form of expression, Raven is an award-winning Multidisciplinary Producer and Creative Director creating work that explores the relationships between identity and space through film, fashion, and business ventures that serve POC.  And so many other amazing folks including Devon Howard (audio), Kofi Newton (audio), Julian Hackney, Kashana Blagrove (audio and so much more!), Rokya Samake (audio and so much more!), Mohammed Ndiaye (audio), Maggie Wong, Allen Kendunga, and Tyree Rush. THE MAIN CAST/CHARACTER Kadia Blagrove, “Lea Watson”

I play Lea, the show’s doubtful, anxious, insecure, melodramatic titular character. She is an exaggerated version of myself. (I think.) Anika Rashaun, “Bethenny Lawrence”

Anika Rashaun is an actress, content creator, and talk show host, and has appeared in shows like MTV’s Real World and The Challenge. She plays Bethenny Lawrence, Lea’s ambitious social media influencer friend from college. When Anika isn’t on screen she is traveling the world and making us all jealous on Instagram! Maurita Salkey, “DeeDee Michaels”

DeeDee, Lea’s bubbly and optimistic childhood BFF, is played by Maurita Salkey, an actress, writer, and entertainment reporter. While she has acted in a number of productions, Maurita is also a queen behind the scenes, working on the development of shows at VH1, BET, AND MTV. Tasneem Nathari, “Sharika Watson”

Tasneem Nathari aka Hoodrat Feminist is an actress and a social media icon for all things body positive, sex positive, and feminist. She plays the role of “Sharika,” Lea’s witty younger sister. Special thanks to all of the other talented actors who appeared in our first season. MY CREATIVE MISSION

Things are ""business as usual"" until some heavy hitters move into town, forcing Pipo to face his own morality time and time again. </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/jZSTcUMf64M?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p>To continue on from the overview, Pipo has been running his crime family smoothly in East Tennessee. Good relationship with the community and the police in general won't mess with Pipo or his family because of the benefits to having them around. However, that doesn't stop Federal agencies from poking their noses around, especially after a few governing members of a notorious Mexican drug cartel move into the area. The coming of a new entity of power pushes Pipo into new business ventures that he doesn't agree with but, he realizes that he has no choice. He will play the game for now until he can find his window but, how much of himself does he have to sacrifice before he can escape? Will things go back to, ""business as usual""?</p><h3>Where did you get the idea for ""PIPO""</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589852873/amtcnxt2otse7enfarkd.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>PIPO (Pe-poh) was my grandfather's nickname to everyone who knew him, including family. He and my grandmother left Cuba with my mother and her two siblings right before Castro came to power. They relocated to New York City in the late 50's where they found themselves in Little Italy. It was there that he made some connections and ended up working for some pretty interesting people to say the least. Around the time the gangs were starting their blood wars (I believe the 60's or 70's), they picked up and relocated to Miami, Fl where my grandfather picked up his work that he left behind in New York. I have heard so many interesting stories about my grandfather, some not so good and others that blew my mind. I never knew any of the things that he was a part of until recently when my mom started telling me more in detail what life was like with him back then. With all of that, the idea to bring his name, Pipo, back to life and play off of his life but dressed for modern times. This series is not your typical gang affiliated show. Pipo touches on serious issues that are not often addressed as they should be.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589852924/uqznifw1hd6mbol65vpi.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2>The Grandson, The Director, The Creator</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589853835/cmooenqupgrf3tqr5paq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>This is where most people would talk about themselves in the 3rd person but, I am choosing to level with you and just be myself like two friends catching up. Well old friend, it's been a while since we last talked and I would love to catch you up on what I have been up to. I know that one of the, if not the most important, questions you may have is, 'why should I trust someone I don't know with my money to produce a show? Who are you?' I can admit, my time in the industry is short to say the least with just now entering my 3rd year. However, in that short amount of time, I haven't just been laying around or not putting my full effort into what I believe. I started off simply making car videos for friends from a local car club and that was when I knew I had a deep love and passion for film. I didn't have a lot of direction in what I wanted to do at the beginning of all of this. I thought that car videos was the top of the top. (I was new, don't judge me to hard!) I made a move to music videos and at first, they were a nightmare. Again, I had no idea or direction of what I was doing but, it gave me a taste for wanting to pursue a narrative instead of just filming random scenes to cut together with flashy transitions. My music videos and the skills I had started to shape and led me to literally falling in love with directing and creating stories. Here is a music video I wrote, Directed, Filmed and edited, please excuse the language!</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/JV8SOo_6RXc?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div>So now you have a little idea of where I am. I fell in love with story telling and music videos were a perfect medium to feed my need to create. I enrolled myself into The Los Angeles Film School in July of 2019 for my Bachelor's Degree in Digital Filmmaking because I knew it was the only way to take myself to a more professional, formal level. I wanted to understand the how's and why's behind a movie, tv show, or even a commercial advertisement and this was my moment. (Can I brag a little and say as of this Campaign creation, I am holding a GPA of 3.92 strong and steady).</div><div>A few months in, I tackled my very first short film from start to finish called, Social. Social is currently available via Amazon Prime and Youtube and for my first film, it has been selected already in its first film Festival! <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> Social is still gaining momentum as it was considered by Crypt TV. However, the genre did not fit the viewer content. Receiving an invite to submit future work was offered and I look forward to doing so. Social had me motivated  to pursue another project from the ground up. Rideshare was the next endeavor, and a humbling experience going from four people to a sizeable cast in my second film attempt. I learned what it meant to organize and prepare for the shoot day and was able to improve even more as a Director as a whole. Rideshare has also won awards with The New York City International Screenplay Awards as a Semi-Finalist, Semi-Finalist in the Lift-Off First Time Filmmaker Sessions, and selected for The Horror Movie Awards!</span>

<p>Michael Mathis is an Actor as well as an aspiring Producer. With work and credit in Jumanji: The Next Level to leading roles on Oxygen Channel to working crime scenes on ID Channel, Mike brings a solid amount of experience to PIPO.

How can we when people like you are helping and being a part of this from the beginning?? We can't. We need you and can only hope that you believe in it enough to need us too. </p><h3> </h3></div>","OverviewPipo is a crime-drama following a Cuban gangster who lives in Knoxville, Tn; the pipeline to the country via I-40. Things are ""business as usual"" until some heavy hitters move into town, forcing Pipo to face his own morality time and time again. To continue on from the overview, Pipo has been running his crime family smoothly in East Tennessee. Good relationship with the community and the police in general won't mess with Pipo or his family because of the benefits to having them around. However, that doesn't stop Federal agencies from poking their noses around, especially after a few governing members of a notorious Mexican drug cartel move into the area. The coming of a new entity of power pushes Pipo into new business ventures that he doesn't agree with but, he realizes that he has no choice. He will play the game for now until he can find his window but, how much of himself does he have to sacrifice before he can escape? Will things go back to, ""business as usual""?Where did you get the idea for ""PIPO""PIPO (Pe-poh) was my grandfather's nickname to everyone who knew him, including family. He and my grandmother left Cuba with my mother and her two siblings right before Castro came to power. They relocated to New York City in the late 50's where they found themselves in Little Italy. It was there that he made some connections and ended up working for some pretty interesting people to say the least. Around the time the gangs were starting their blood wars (I believe the 60's or 70's), they picked up and relocated to Miami, Fl where my grandfather picked up his work that he left behind in New York. I have heard so many interesting stories about my grandfather, some not so good and others that blew my mind. I never knew any of the things that he was a part of until recently when my mom started telling me more in detail what life was like with him back then. With all of that, the idea to bring his name, Pipo, back to life and play off of his life but dressed for modern times. This series is not your typical gang affiliated show. Pipo touches on serious issues that are not often addressed as they should be. The Grandson, The Director, The CreatorThis is where most people would talk about themselves in the 3rd person but, I am choosing to level with you and just be myself like two friends catching up. Well old friend, it's been a while since we last talked and I would love to catch you up on what I have been up to. I know that one of the, if not the most important, questions you may have is, 'why should I trust someone I don't know with my money to produce a show? Who are you?' I can admit, my time in the industry is short to say the least with just now entering my 3rd year. However, in that short amount of time, I haven't just been laying around or not putting my full effort into what I believe. I started off simply making car videos for friends from a local car club and that was when I knew I had a deep love and passion for film. I didn't have a lot of direction in what I wanted to do at the beginning of all of this. I thought that car videos was the top of the top. (I was new, don't judge me to hard!) I made a move to music videos and at first, they were a nightmare. Again, I had no idea or direction of what I was doing but, it gave me a taste for wanting to pursue a narrative instead of just filming random scenes to cut together with flashy transitions. My music videos and the skills I had started to shape and led me to literally falling in love with directing and creating stories. Here is a music video I wrote, Directed, Filmed and edited, please excuse the language!So now you have a little idea of where I am. I fell in love with story telling and music videos were a perfect medium to feed my need to create. I enrolled myself into The Los Angeles Film School in July of 2019 for my Bachelor's Degree in Digital Filmmaking because I knew it was the only way to take myself to a more professional, formal level. I wanted to understand the how's and why's behind a movie, tv show, or even a commercial advertisement and this was my moment. (Can I brag a little and say as of this Campaign creation, I am holding a GPA of 3.92 strong and steady).A few months in, I tackled my very first short film from start to finish called, Social. Social is currently available via Amazon Prime and Youtube and for my first film, it has been selected already in its first film Festival!  Social is still gaining momentum as it was considered by Crypt TV. However, the genre did not fit the viewer content. Receiving an invite to submit future work was offered and I look forward to doing so. Social had me motivated  to pursue another project from the ground up. Rideshare was the next endeavor, and a humbling experience going from four people to a sizeable cast in my second film attempt. I learned what it meant to organize and prepare for the shoot day and was able to improve even more as a Director as a whole. Rideshare has also won awards with The New York City International Screenplay Awards as a Semi-Finalist, Semi-Finalist in the Lift-Off First Time Filmmaker Sessions, and selected for The Horror Movie Awards!


Oh, and I have made sure to keep busy in between as well, taking initiative to improve my skillsets, even outside of school.
I invite you to check out everything I've done at my Youtube channel, www.youtube.com/DanielShootsVideosS

 
Enough About That Guy! Who Else is Working??
Alright, Alright! So now you got to know me a little but, I want to quickly introduce who is behind the scenes so far bringing everything together.
Our Producer

Michael Mathis is an Actor as well as an aspiring Producer. With work and credit in Jumanji: The Next Level to leading roles on Oxygen Channel to working crime scenes on ID Channel, Mike brings a solid amount of experience to PIPO. His ability to break a script down and plan out each scene is incredible and the reason I know that this will be a success. 
 
Our Writer, Our Dream Weaver

Julie De La Fuente is an amazing writer, and I am not just saying that because she is working on this world. I can guarantee you, the way she can tell stories and mold such intricate tails in a way that won't lose you but keep you hooked, she will be a major name one day and we are so incredibly lucky to have her right here with us building such an intense world!
Director of Photography

 David Cunningham is nearing the end of the very same Degree Program I am in at LA Film School. David holds his Honor Society Status and comes with a ton of experience from outside of school as well. A former US Marine, sorry David......correction, a US Marine, (Once a Marine, always a Marine, am I right?) David has worked in live production as well as event filming. His most recent projects include running a live streaming campaign for a local Non-Profit Organization called The Little Ponderosa Zoo and Rescue as well as part of the film crew on a local wrestling production that is on our local CBS Affiliate as well as Amazon Prime. Our Music. Our Composer. Our Beethoven.Dan Holtz is The Man, to put it simply. He has so many awards and credits that it would take up way to much of your time to read through them all but, he is a heavy hitter. I'll post his reel for you to enjoy and see for yourself. Dan joined us for Rideshare and I knew we had to get him to come back. After seeing the PIPO teaser, Dan quickly went to work and within hours, he had the score figured out and sent back to us. His excitement told us what we already knew; that we are onto something big and big projects need big hitters like Dan.   This section of course will be updated as we find our missing pieces to our puzzle but, hopefully that gives you a little more faith in who is working on bringing this to life.   Woah, Buddy....What About the Cast??Casting as you would imagine is the most difficult part of all of this. Some would argue other areas but, we know our story is solid so we want to make sure that we find the right people to properly portray it to our audience.

<h3>Good Cop Bae Cop</h3>
<p>Detective Simeri and Detective Leary are fighting crime and each other, in Good Cop Bae Cop. GCBC is a comedy web series that follows two young LAPD officers who just so happen to be a couple. They say it's a bad idea to date your coworkers, so help us show you how it can also be hilarious. </p>
<h3>Who We Are </h3>
<p>We are Anna Simeri and Sean Leary. Stand-up comedians, writers, producers, and together as a couple for five years. Good Cop Bae Cop is a long time coming for us.  Pretty early on in our relationship, we realized we had something particular in common…we want to be TV cops. This is a dream that lives deep down in both of us. Neither one of us are the type to give up and the favorite quality of our relationship is that we're continually pushing each other to be better. Because of those two things, Good Cop Bae Cop was born. A product of hard work and years of discussing how cool it would be to wear a fake badge. </p>
<h3>Season 1</h3>
<p>The first season of Good Cop Bae Cop will be six episodes. You can watch the pilot episode <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjqKccMqkiw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.<br/>Watch us attempt to catch Tinsel Town's biggest asshole, <i>The Mooner</i>, while also trying to avoid fighting about who's turn it is to get groceries. There will be car chases, stakeouts, the captain telling us we're too close to the case &amp; pretty much everything you love about cop content. We couldn't be more excited about what's to come!</p>
<p>We’re currently working with the wickedly talented (I’m hoping we all read that in John Travolta’s Oscar presenting voice) Cole Garrett and Keegan Duncan of Happy Pants Productions to make this the best possible show it can be. If you watch the pilot, hopefully, you'll be able to tell that production value is not something we are willing to compromise. That being said, that's what's stopping us from making more. We're all very proud of the pilot, but we're also confident we can make this upcoming season EVEN BETTER. More characters, nicer uniforms, movie quality sets, etc. Out of sheer shock to the both of us, not a single television network has offered us thousands of dollars to make our show…..., crazy, right? Sadly, that means we're funding this 100% on our own, and great content is not cheap.</p>
<h3>We Need Your Help!</h3>
<p>COVID-19 has greatly affected everyone on the planet, but for us, it's mostly financially. Sure, staying quarantined with no toilet paper isn't great for our mental health, but sadly we are unable to make any money right now, and that's worse. Our business and 100% of our income is producing and performing live events. Every show has been canceled for the foreseeable future, including a few road gigs that were going to be extremely lucrative.  We wanted to be able to put all we had into GCBC, but unfortunately, all we have is going towards surviving this crazy time right now. That’s why we're asking for a little help from you. We talk regularly about how lucky we are to be able to do what we love while also having a tremendous support system. So many of you have come to our shows (a lot of you to multiple shows) commented on our silly Instagram videos, and reached out with kind words and gifts when we were going through a significant loss in our family. If you're not able to help us monetarily today, just know that we still see and appreciate you. If you ARE able to help, you're so much better than those other people, and we thank you for it.</p>

<h3>Turns Out Making a Web Series is ALSO expensive. </h3>
<h3>We want to be able to make this show with a professional, experienced crew and equipment, so we need some help! </h3>
<ul>
<li>Babbs and Maria Lopez are twins who have recently been making a splash in indie projects and the documentary film, ""The Pistol Shrimps"". They are improvisers who also play a little basketball on the side, in between nannying and running the world. The twins have an incredible sense of humor and everyone relates to their struggles as sisters, women, friends, lovers and humans. </li>
<li>We want to raise money for this webseries in order to create the best product that we can, while valuing the time and talents of the crew and actors. (Psssst. This is Elizabeth, producer extraordinaire, filling this out because Babbs and Maria have a hard time asking for help). It's fine, if you don't want to donate, they get it, would they donate to your campaign? It's a strong maybe. They'd definitely volunteer their services as extras or craft services if they have time. Which, if you have time to donate instead of money, we will gladly accept that as well. </li>
<li>If you donate a few dollars to our campaign we will be able rent a camera, some lighting equipment, pay the crew, pay the cast, hire an editor that knows what they are doing, promote the videos online and all that other stuff that comes with creating a project sans studio. Oh and snacks, we will use the money for snacks. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising $5000 for the first season of Babbs and Maria Go To Therapy.</p>
<ul>
<li>All of the funds raised will go to support this web series. We are functioning with a skeleton crew and very little money for equipment, but we think that's all this series is going to need. Why ask for more than what you need?</li>
<li>By donating to BAMGTT you can get exclusive perks like a ""One Minute Catch Up"" video dedicated solely to YOU! A social media shoutout from the twins. A Skype session with our director, producer or cast. Check them out and see what kind of swag you're missing in your life. </li>
<li>If we don't reach our full goal we will forge ahead and make the series with what money we can raise, supported by favors from our lovely and talented filmmaker friends. The LA City Women's Municipal Basketball league has about 24 teams in it, so we're confident we can get at least 2 members from a team or two to come help us. We may sell it as a scrimmage, but they'll probably be on board once they get there. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?</h3>
<p>Frankly, we just want to make people laugh. </p>
<ul>
<li>The world has been a little rough lately. What do we love more than laughing at other people's pain? Not much. Chips and Salsa. Margaritas. 1/2 off Wine nights. We would love to brighten your day, make you laugh and attempt to heal their relationship. </li>
<li>As women in an industry dominated by men we want to create our own opportunities as well as hire women for our projects. We are committed to hiring at least a 50% female crew, with 4 women at the helm already we are well on our way! </li>
</ul>

<p>Mapuana is used to taking direction from Babbs and Maria on the basketball court when she's in foul trouble during a game, so switching roles is going to be a fun experiment! Mapuana has been a shadow director and finalist in the ABC Discovers Talent showcase, has directed numerous short plays, and is also an actor and singer.<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2435995/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2435995/</a></p>

<p><strong>Elizabeth </strong>was born in Pueblo, Colorado, brought up on movies like Airplane!, Naked Gun and Clue! She quickly developed a razor sharp wit and repartee that sometimes only her siblings and cousins can truly get (They were raised on the same movies, which makes it easier). She loves to laugh and cause others to dissolve into laughter. Elizabeth met Babbs and Maria at iO West while they were on Harold teams and are currently members of the Ba Dunka Dunks basketball team. Elizabeth is an actress and writer who has been doing a whole lot of producing lately. She has produced 4 short films in the last year and a half, organizing all aspects of production, as well as doing everything she has too. . . sometimes she's crafty, sometimes she's the wardrobe person but she's always ready to put on any hat she has to in order for a project to be successful (Once I built a fake walk out of blanket and C- stands). ""It Happened Again Last Night"", a short film she produced has been in 14 film festivals, garnered 22 nominations and racked up 14 wins. ""What Metal Girls Are Into"", a horror comedy short made its debut on the festival scene a few short months ago and has already been in 16 festivals, winning 3 awards! ""Weather Talk"" and ""Always Remember Me"" are currently in post production and should be hitting the festival circuit soon. She can't wait for you to meet Babbs and Maria so they can brighten your life like they have hers!  <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2235318/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2235318/​</a></p>

<p>Maria Lopez was born in LA and raised on the Dodgers, Lakers, beans and rice. She ran around the mean streets of LA chasing ice cream trucks with her twin sister Babbs. Once they were teenagers, the ice cream trucks changed to punk rock gigs and in college punk rock gigs changed to comedy. She has performed at countless theatres in and out of California. This is the second piece she has written based on true stories from her life. Maria is currently living in Hollywood, reading, writing, performing and admittedly still chasing ice cream trucks, punk rock gigs and comedy.</p>

<p> (Barbara Ivette Lopez Morales... yes, the whole thing), is a Mexican American actress, comedian, and improviser, who was born and raised all over the hoods of Los Angeles, California. She was an introvert and relied on her twin sister to be her one and only friend. </p>
<p>In her teenage years she was a punk rock kid, who liked to listen to music and skateboard with her friends. By sheer luck, she discovered theatre. She realized her dark, dead pan demeanor made people laugh, and that fed her soul like nothing ever had before! It became an addiction! She pursued improv comedy and acting in college, and followed it to Hollywood. She threw thousands of dollars at improv schools and did numerous shows all over LA clubs, but mostly spent too much money at their bars. </p>
<p>To this day, there’s nothing that makes her  feel happier and more alive, than  making people laugh,  and to help them forget life’s troubles, if even only for a brief moment. It’s the best gift in the world.   <a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7658493"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7658493</a></p>

</div></div>","Turns Out Making a Web Series is ALSO expensive. 
We want to be able to make this show with a professional, experienced crew and equipment, so we need some help! 

Babbs and Maria Lopez are twins who have recently been making a splash in indie projects and the documentary film, ""The Pistol Shrimps"". They are improvisers who also play a little basketball on the side, in between nannying and running the world. The twins have an incredible sense of humor and everyone relates to their struggles as sisters, women, friends, lovers and humans. 
We want to raise money for this webseries in order to create the best product that we can, while valuing the time and talents of the crew and actors. (Psssst. This is Elizabeth, producer extraordinaire, filling this out because Babbs and Maria have a hard time asking for help). It's fine, if you don't want to donate, they get it, would they donate to your campaign? It's a strong maybe. They'd definitely volunteer their services as extras or craft services if they have time. Which, if you have time to donate instead of money, we will gladly accept that as well. 
If you donate a few dollars to our campaign we will be able rent a camera, some lighting equipment, pay the crew, pay the cast, hire an editor that knows what they are doing, promote the videos online and all that other stuff that comes with creating a project sans studio. Oh and snacks, we will use the money for snacks. 

 

What We Need & What You Get
We are raising $5000 for the first season of Babbs and Maria Go To Therapy.

All of the funds raised will go to support this web series. We are functioning with a skeleton crew and very little money for equipment, but we think that's all this series is going to need. Why ask for more than what you need?
By donating to BAMGTT you can get exclusive perks like a ""One Minute Catch Up"" video dedicated solely to YOU! A social media shoutout from the twins. A Skype session with our director, producer or cast. Check them out and see what kind of swag you're missing in your life. 
If we don't reach our full goal we will forge ahead and make the series with what money we can raise, supported by favors from our lovely and talented filmmaker friends. The LA City Women's Municipal Basketball league has about 24 teams in it, so we're confident we can get at least 2 members from a team or two to come help us. We may sell it as a scrimmage, but they'll probably be on board once they get there. 

 

WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?
Frankly, we just want to make people laugh. 

The world has been a little rough lately. What do we love more than laughing at other people's pain? Not much. Chips and Salsa. Margaritas. 1/2 off Wine nights. We would love to brighten your day, make you laugh and attempt to heal their relationship. 
As women in an industry dominated by men we want to create our own opportunities as well as hire women for our projects. We are committed to hiring at least a 50% female crew, with 4 women at the helm already we are well on our way! 


The Team 
DIRECTOR- Mapuana Makia

Mapuana is used to taking direction from Babbs and Maria on the basketball court when she's in foul trouble during a game, so switching roles is going to be a fun experiment! Mapuana has been a shadow director and finalist in the ABC Discovers Talent showcase, has directed numerous short plays, and is also an actor and singer. http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2435995/
PRODUCER - Elizabeth Mihelich 

Elizabeth was born in Pueblo, Colorado, brought up on movies like Airplane!, Naked Gun and Clue! She quickly developed a razor sharp wit and repartee that sometimes only her siblings and cousins can truly get (They were raised on the same movies, which makes it easier). She loves to laugh and cause others to dissolve into laughter. Elizabeth met Babbs and Maria at iO West while they were on Harold teams and are currently members of the Ba Dunka Dunks basketball team. Elizabeth is an actress and writer who has been doing a whole lot of producing lately. She has produced 4 short films in the last year and a half, organizing all aspects of production, as well as doing everything she has too. . . sometimes she's crafty, sometimes she's the wardrobe person but she's always ready to put on any hat she has to in order for a project to be successful (Once I built a fake walk out of blanket and C- stands). ""It Happened Again Last Night"", a short film she produced has been in 14 film festivals, garnered 22 nominations and racked up 14 wins. ""What Metal Girls Are Into"", a horror comedy short made its debut on the festival scene a few short months ago and has already been in 16 festivals, winning 3 awards! ""Weather Talk"" and ""Always Remember Me"" are currently in post production and should be hitting the festival circuit soon. She can't wait for you to meet Babbs and Maria so they can brighten your life like they have hers!  http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2235318/​
WRITER - Maria Evelyn Lopez
  
Maria Lopez was born in LA and raised on the Dodgers, Lakers, beans and rice. She ran around the mean streets of LA chasing ice cream trucks with her twin sister Babbs. Once they were teenagers, the ice cream trucks changed to punk rock gigs and in college punk rock gigs changed to comedy. She has performed at countless theatres in and out of California. This is the second piece she has written based on true stories from her life. Maria is currently living in Hollywood, reading, writing, performing and admittedly still chasing ice cream trucks, punk rock gigs and comedy.
STARRING- 
Babbs Lopez as BABBS
 
 (Barbara Ivette Lopez Morales... yes, the whole thing), is a Mexican American actress, comedian, and improviser, who was born and raised all over the hoods of Los Angeles, California. She was an introvert and relied on her twin sister to be her one and only friend. 
In her teenage years she was a punk rock kid, who liked to listen to music and skateboard with her friends. By sheer luck, she discovered theatre. She realized her dark, dead pan demeanor made people laugh, and that fed her soul like nothing ever had before! It became an addiction! She pursued improv comedy and acting in college, and followed it to Hollywood. She threw thousands of dollars at improv schools and did numerous shows all over LA clubs, but mostly spent too much money at their bars. 
To this day, there’s nothing that makes her  feel happier and more alive, than  making people laugh,  and to help them forget life’s troubles, if even only for a brief moment. It’s the best gift in the world.   http://www.imdb.com/name/nm7658493

<h3>We are a group of old high school friends who have been writing, performing, and directing comedy sketches, plays and routines for years. Now, after years of planning and prepping, we are ready to begin shooting the first season of our digital series GREEN CROSS!</h3>
<p><strong><i>GREEN CROSS</i></strong> is a workplace comedy that takes place in a marijuana dispensary. Our protagonist, Nick, has found out that his old partner, Dean, is in jail for a crime he committed on the premises of his dispensary...which he just so happened to include Nick's name on the deed. So now Nick, a grumpy, drop out of a man who hates drugs and drug people, must run this shop legally and legitimately or else he'll end up in jail himself.</p>
<p>Nick quickly finds himself working with the most oddball group of employees, such as a ""bud-tender"" who knows nothing about weed, an accountant who thinks he's a gangster, a fight crazy security guard, and a take-no-guff right hand woman, while being constantly hounded by the bumbling local sheriff's deputy who is dead set on taking everyone down. </p>
<p>We have been wanting to create a show for as long as we can remember. Now we've finally stopped letting life and work and adulting get in our way and are going all out for this. It has made us all laugh like crazy, and we know it'll make you laugh too. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Everybody in our team has made and performed in countless short films, plays, and sketches, working with volunteer crews, borrowed apartments, subpar equipment, and cheap pizza. To paraphrase Danny Glover in the Lethal Weapon movies, we're too old for this. </p>
<p>We are aiming to raise $6,000 to cover four days of filming. Our plan is to film the first three episodes. These three will work not only on their own, but are also crafted to come together as a full half hour episode, allowing us to shop our project in both formats. </p>
<p>The funds will allow us to properly pay our cast and crew. They are a fantastic team of people and we want to make sure that we compensate them with more than snacks and something for their reel. The funds will also be used to rent and secure a proper location that looks the part and works for our filming needs. We also plan on purchasing and creating props, getting a dedicated sound operator, paying our post production professionals, and hopefully buying quality pizza. We have  a lot of fun and unique rewards for our donations, so check out the perks package and give what you can!</p>

<h3><strong>Who am I?</strong></h3>
<p><br/>My name is Elsabet Ademe and I was born in Bahir Dar Ethiopia. I left  my beloved country 16 years ago, to follow my dream of working in the Hollywood industry.  The road to the U.S. for me was long and difficult...I faced death on several occasions being smuggled through several African and European countries before legally immigrating to the United States from Central America.  I actually wrote a book about that journey, called <i>Sunrise</i>, and hopefully someday the fullness of that story will be told on screen.  But for now, I'm setting my sights on this smaller project that explores one important snippet of my experience.</p>
<p>As a bartender in real life, I've been fascinated to informally ""study"" the role alcohol plays in the lives of the people I serve. I've watched relationships start and end because of alcohol. I've watched people drink to celebrate their happiness, numb their pain, cover their loneliness, and find new friends...or new victims.  </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The Story</strong></h3>
<p><br/>So it wasn't hard to envision a character who becomes a bartender to do exactly that-study peoples' relationship with alcohol-because of her own pressing circumstances.  Amy Solomon is an Ethiopian immigrant to the U.S. who's relationship with her fiancé is turned upside down by his drinking problem. The morays of Ethiopian culture, coupled with Amy's own good nature and love for Nate, lead her to go to amazing lengths to understand and help him. But over the course of the 6-episode season, her journey to understand Nate evolves into a journey to better understand herself and her own values. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Ask </strong></h3>
<p><br/>We are attempting to raise $30,000 towards the production budget of the six remaining episodes.  It's a big ask, but faith can move mountains right?  This money will go towards equipment rentals, post production (editing, color correction, etc.), insurance, cast and crew salaries, meals, locations, set design/wardrobe/make-up, props and set decoration.  In the (unlikely!) event we only reach a fraction of our goal, the priority for funds raised on Indiegogo will be equipment rental and post production costs.  </p>
<p>The biggest challenge facing me is the temptation to cut corners for the sake of expedience. I'm committed to seeking the most cost-effective ways to accomplish high production values. We will beg, we will borrow, we will use due diligence to shop around. But ultimately this project WILL get done, and it WILL be a polished and beautiful web series, however long it takes. We have a great team of professionals coming together already (see the link below) and your donation is crucially important to our artistic imperative.   </p>

</div></div>","Who am I?
My name is Elsabet Ademe and I was born in Bahir Dar Ethiopia. I left  my beloved country 16 years ago, to follow my dream of working in the Hollywood industry.  The road to the U.S. for me was long and difficult...I faced death on several occasions being smuggled through several African and European countries before legally immigrating to the United States from Central America.  I actually wrote a book about that journey, called Sunrise, and hopefully someday the fullness of that story will be told on screen.  But for now, I'm setting my sights on this smaller project that explores one important snippet of my experience.
As a bartender in real life, I've been fascinated to informally ""study"" the role alcohol plays in the lives of the people I serve. I've watched relationships start and end because of alcohol. I've watched people drink to celebrate their happiness, numb their pain, cover their loneliness, and find new friends...or new victims.  
 
The Story
So it wasn't hard to envision a character who becomes a bartender to do exactly that-study peoples' relationship with alcohol-because of her own pressing circumstances.  Amy Solomon is an Ethiopian immigrant to the U.S. who's relationship with her fiancé is turned upside down by his drinking problem. The morays of Ethiopian culture, coupled with Amy's own good nature and love for Nate, lead her to go to amazing lengths to understand and help him. But over the course of the 6-episode season, her journey to understand Nate evolves into a journey to better understand herself and her own values. 
 
The Ask 
We are attempting to raise $30,000 towards the production budget of the six remaining episodes.  It's a big ask, but faith can move mountains right?  This money will go towards equipment rentals, post production (editing, color correction, etc.), insurance, cast and crew salaries, meals, locations, set design/wardrobe/make-up, props and set decoration.  In the (unlikely!) event we only reach a fraction of our goal, the priority for funds raised on Indiegogo will be equipment rental and post production costs.  
The biggest challenge facing me is the temptation to cut corners for the sake of expedience. I'm committed to seeking the most cost-effective ways to accomplish high production values. We will beg, we will borrow, we will use due diligence to shop around. But ultimately this project WILL get done, and it WILL be a polished and beautiful web series, however long it takes. We have a great team of professionals coming together already (see the link below) and your donation is crucially important to our artistic imperative.

<p>A Gay Victorian Affair is a webseries produced in Toronto by comedian/actor/writer/me, Robert Watson! It’s Downton Abbey Meets Queer as Folk, a non-traditional, Homosexual Romance brought to life, and provides a subversive look at what it takes to survive as a Queer person in Victorian England.</p>

ICYMI, YouTube has a bit of a reputation for restricting LGBTQ content.
