<p>I am a 25-year old independent researcher and writer. I have my own website (<a href=""http://www.andrewgavinmarshall.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.andrewgavinmarshall.com</a>) and have been running a writing project for nearly one year, <a href=""http://www.thepeoplesbookproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The People's Book Project</a>, which is a crowd-funded project aiming to write a series of books on a radical history of power and resistance in the modern world, taking a highly critical and heavily researched look at institutions and ideas of social, political, economic, cultural, psychological and historical power. However, I only have a small following and limited resources. </p>
<p>My objective is to get the first book in the series out as soon as possible, since it is dealing with issues relevant to everyone's lives: the global economic crisis (its causes and consequences), and the development of anti-austerity movements around the world in resistance to the economic crisis and the actions of elites: from Greece, to Spain, Portugal, the U.K., Iceland, Chile, Mexico, Quebec, and beyond.</p>
<p>It seems that everywhere in the world, people my age are taking to the streets and finding creative new ways of resisting power, repression, impoverishment and exploitation. Whether Egypt, Spain, or here where I live in Quebec, it is the youth who are rising up against the excesses of elites, youth who graduate university with degrees and no job opportunities, who follow the 'rules' and are left with nothing but debts, who expected the world, and got the boot.</p>
<p>My objective with this first book in the series is to arm the youth - and others - of the world with a radical exposé of the institutions, individuals, and ideas of domination, and, alternatively, of resistance and revolution. I seek to bring information and analysis to what seems to be an ever-emerging and expanding global youth-driven revolution. </p>
<p>I am a young student, researcher, and writer of meagre means, but I have been writing about issues of power and resistance for several years, and I would like to be able to travel to Europe in order to see the effects of the crisis and reactions of the people in the form of protest and creative resistance, to interview those participating in and documenting resistance movements, such as the 'We Don't Pay' movement out of Greece, the Indignados in Spain, etc., and to document the true nature of this global crisis, which is most acutely being felt in Europe at the moment.</p>
<p>I have already written a great deal of the book, focused almost exclusively on Europe at the moment, but I need funds to continue putting my time and effort into completing the book, as well as to travel to Europe to see 'the revolution' up close and personal. It is one thing to study a situation from afar, and entirely another to see it up close and in person.</p>
<p>My only income derives from donations from readers and supporters around the world, but that has largely dried up of late, and I need to expand my reach. I am hoping to raise $9,000 so that I can continue putting the necessary time and resources into finishing this book by the New Year, and to travel to Europe for at least one month in a 'revolutionary tour' of crisis and resistance, and to document the trip in both articles for public consumption and to add to the final book. Most of the money would have to go to the trip to Europe to cover flight, train/travel, lodging, food and other necessities (at least $6,000); the rest would cover my living expenses while I research and finish writing the book, essentially, food and rent.</p>
<p>I have been writing this particular volume of the book for less than two months, and already have completed more than 300 pages (single-spaced) of unedited research. I have made samples of both my research and analysis available to the public on my websites, so that people may read and see for themselves the type of material I produce, and decide if they think it is worth supporting. I will continue to do this for supporters, who would receive samples of my work and research.</p>
<p>I have been living very modestly for some time, and live well below the poverty line, but writing is my passion and my purpose in life. While constantly being broke takes a toll, my research and writing give me sustenance and a determination like nothing else in my life. Supporting a writer is always risky, but I hope you think it might just be worth it. The world around us is changing so rapidly, prices go up, and wages go down, debts get higher and job searches harder; while poverty spreads, the elites take more for themselves, in profits and power. But something is changing: the people, and most especially the youth of the world are waking up, rising up, from Occupy to Athens, from Santiago to Cairo, taking to the streets, raising questions, demanding change, and planting the seeds of creating an altogether new society which is not designed to benefit the few at the expense of the many.</p>
<p>I want to be a part of this process, I want to document, analyze and help it forward, to inform action and inspire thought and discussion, to give strength to those who struggle, strength through the 'mighty pen' instead of the seraded sword. I want to Write the Revolution, as best as I can.</p>
<p>I need your support to make this a reality.</p>
<p>So in the name of solidarity, thank you to all who have and continue to support this project!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Andrew Gavin Marshall</p>

<h3> <strong>WHAT IS ""ME+YOU""??</strong>
</h3>
<p>When I began this project, I originally wanted to film a documentary that would attempt to answer the eternal question: What is love? “Project: L.O.V.E.” it was called. “Longing, Obsession, and Various Emotions.” See how I spelled out the word “LOVE” again right there? I thought that was pretty swanky.</p>
<p>I saw “When Harry Met Sally” in college, and the interviews interspersed throughout the film moved me deeply. The simplicity of two people talking about their relationship was fascinating. I wanted to take this idea and put it on a much larger scale. And, unlike the film, I wanted to have ordinary people sharing real stories. Not actors. Everyone has a story. Every story is unique and special. And more often than not, the truth is much stranger than fiction.</p>
<p>So I went on my merry way to shoot a documentary. I bought a camera and two microphones. I pretended that I knew how to frame a shot. I became the director and interviewer all in one. But I soon realized that in order to shoot a documentary professionally, I would need more people behind the scenes. I’d need two or three cameras. I’d need professional lighting. And finally, I’d need subjects who were willing to divulge private information in front of a lot of strangers. I began to realize that this was my baby, and I wanted to do it alone. This way I could come in, set up my camera, and talk to these wonderful people with no pressure to “get the right shot” or for them to “say the right thing.” I wanted the interviews to be as raw and untouched as possible. So I decided to write a book of interviews instead.  Thus ""Me+You"" was born.  </p>
<p>I have interviewed widows, couples who have been married for fifty years or more, and couples who have divorced and remarried. I have interviewed couples who have made the decision not to marry. I have interviewed interracial couples and same-sex couples. Each couple has their own unique story. The names have been changed out of respect to those interviewed, but the stories remain the same. What has evolved is a unique book of interviews that is full of heart. In short: ranging from ages thirty to eighty-seven, different couples share their stories of love, hardship and why they stay together through it all. </p>
<h3>WHAT I NEED:</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>""Me+You"" has been written, self-published, and is available now on Amazon.  However, in order to cover printing and marketing costs and to push it to the next level, I need some extra help from you! I would be eternally grateful for anything you could donate. Even a dollar helps!</p>

<p>Please just spread the word. Share this link on your facebook and twitter pages. Tell your friends about the book! Visit the website and ask your friends and family to do the same!!</p>

Every story is unique and special. And more often than not, the truth is much stranger than fiction.
So I went on my merry way to shoot a documentary. I bought a camera and two microphones. I pretended that I knew how to frame a shot. I became the director and interviewer all in one. But I soon realized that in order to shoot a documentary professionally, I would need more people behind the scenes. I’d need two or three cameras. I’d need professional lighting. And finally, I’d need subjects who were willing to divulge private information in front of a lot of strangers. I began to realize that this was my baby, and I wanted to do it alone. This way I could come in, set up my camera, and talk to these wonderful people with no pressure to “get the right shot” or for them to “say the right thing.” I wanted the interviews to be as raw and untouched as possible. So I decided to write a book of interviews instead.  Thus ""Me+You"" was born.  
I have interviewed widows, couples who have been married for fifty years or more, and couples who have divorced and remarried. I have interviewed couples who have made the decision not to marry. I have interviewed interracial couples and same-sex couples. Each couple has their own unique story. The names have been changed out of respect to those interviewed, but the stories remain the same. What has evolved is a unique book of interviews that is full of heart. In short: ranging from ages thirty to eighty-seven, different couples share their stories of love, hardship and why they stay together through it all. 
WHAT I NEED:


""Me+You"" has been written, self-published, and is available now on Amazon.  However, in order to cover printing and marketing costs and to push it to the next level, I need some extra help from you! I would be eternally grateful for anything you could donate. Even a dollar helps!

<p>I have been studying the Israeli/Palestinian conflict since 9/11 and already own many books on the subject. <strong>But this is the one I have been waiting for to share with family and friends</strong>.<br/>    ~ Ann, Amazon<br/><br/>This book surprised me. At first I thought the author was some tree-hugging liberal loon, but throughout the book she showed a rational mind, and wrote an interesting story about life in Palestine. <strong>I'll credit this book for changing my stance on the entire Israel-Palestinian conflict</strong>.<br/>    ~ Joshua, Goodreads<br/><br/>It is refreshing and eye opening to read so many positive stories about the people of Palestine. I realize now how little I knew about them, and am sorry to say that most of it was negative. <strong>Since reading this, I have been doing a lot of research and talking with friends and family about what I am learning about Palestine</strong>.<br/>    ~ Lori, Amazon</p>
<p>An unexpected, unlikely love letter to Palestine. It will invite comparisons to <em>Eat Pray Love</em>, I imagine. <strong>But <em>Fast Times in Palestine</em> is funnier, more interesting, and more levelheaded</strong>.<br/>    ~ E, Book blogger<br/><br/>I bought this book with the hope of learning about Palestinian culture... and what I got out of it was so much more. <strong>I believe it should be required reading in schools, and I'm encouraging everyone I know to read it</strong>.<br/>    ~ Adara, Amazon</p>

<h2>I've bought a ticket to Coachella Music Festival - now what?</h2>
<p>I recently took a huge leap of faith, and bought a ticket to one of the most popular and widely acclaimed music festivals in the USA, if not the world.</p>
<p>As a freelance music journalist from Cape Town, South Africa, it would be a dream come true to be able to report on a festival with the calibre of Coachella. But in making this decision to travel to the other side of the world, it has been a case of 'saddling up before finding the horse', and I need to be able to somehow fund my American Dream and create a professional, informative and interesting report on the festival.</p>
<p>I have an intrinsic passion to be creative and to write, borne by a life-long enthusiasm for English and journalism. At the same time, I have an analytical and logical spirit, which led me to study two Engineering degrees at the <a href=""http://www.uct.ac.za"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">University of Cape Town</a>, in the fields of Construction Studies and, most recently, Quantity Surveying.</p>
<p>After finally graduating from university in December 2012, I was torn between two career paths - a life as a Professional Quantity Surveyor, or one as a music journalist?</p>
<p>My creative heart led the way this time, taking my part-time blog <a href=""http://www.theeaglesnestza.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""The Eagle's Nest""</a> full-time in January 2013, and it soon led me to purchasing this ticket for an opportunity that very few South Africans have experienced, let alone SA music journalists.</p>
<p>My dream is now within my grasp, and together with your help, I'll have the funding to be able to reach out and grab it.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What I Need</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>To break it down for you, this is what I'll need in terms of funding to be able to make my trip from at least the 13th to 27th of April 2013 possible, and to help create a professional report:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li class=""_mce_tagged_br"">Local and international flights from Cape Town, South Africa to San Francisco, California ($3180)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class=""_mce_tagged_br"">Visa application costs ($170)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class=""_mce_tagged_br"">Accommodation expenses ($2000)</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li class=""_mce_tagged_br"">Shipping costs ($250)</li>
</ul>
<br/><p><em>N.B. any research and time spent to write up the report is on my account</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What You'll Get</h2>
<p>For you as the contributor, there are certain perks to supporting my campaign to Coachella; one's that could promote you or your business in a mutually beneficial way:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Name and credit given in the eventual festival report, on my website/online journalism portfolio (<a href=""http://www.theeaglesnestza.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Eagle's Nest)</a>, as well as on any social media relating to The Eagle's Nest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Advertising space in said report and on website</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical and digital copies of said report</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If I don't reach the entire goal for this campaign, the funds will still go towards the trip and to providing a report on the 2013 Coachella Music Festival.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>As a music journalist, I write with the intention to be factual, interesting, but most importantly: <em>useful</em>. I know that as a fervent fan of music, that’s the sort of journalism I want to consume. I want to see that constructive style become a standard in the industry, and I want to play my own part in making that vision a reality.</p>
<p>Reporting on this festival will provide me with such an opportunity, and will lay the platform to achieve greater things in my journalism career. If you are a music fan, I'm sure you will see value in the creation of well-researched, high-quality journalism about music, as it allows you to find and enjoy the music that you love.</p>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you will be allowing an earnest, diligent and passionate music journalist to do what he loves, and, at least in his home of country of South Africa, provide first-hand insight into the wondrous and exciting experience that is Coachella.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Report Itself</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">My coverage will consist of reviewing the live performances of each artist I am physically able to see, and I will endeavour to plan a personal line-up that encompasses all the exciting artists that I am currently a fan of. This is so that the content will be imbued with a healthy background understanding and appreciation of the artists in question.<br/><br/>The end product will be a professional report, in digital PDF and physical formats, consisting of advance and post-festival coverage of Weekend 2 of the festival. Coverage will include an introduction to Coachella itself, snippets of this campaign to get me to the festival, pre-festival goals including my personal lineup, and stimulating post-festival analysis of the live acts I was able to see.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>Just as I am a fledgling musical journalist, so may you be a fledgling contributor. But you are still important to the success of fulfilling this dream:</p>

</div></div>","The Idea
People need to read books. They are informative, can make you forget about your ordinary day to day problems, and can even transfer you into entirely new worlds. Many people love to read, but often can’t find the time to do so.
This is why we’ve developed a new way of reading eBooks. We want to offer novels in digital episodes at affordable rates. Every week, we are going to release a new episode of each novel, which in total would add up to 12 different episodes per eBook.
 
 

 
The Product
We will offer two different versions of each episode, so that you can enjoy your books the way you want to:


Version one: normal text version for eReaders (.pdf,.epub,.mobi, etc.)


Version two: the special feature version designed for tablets (iPad,Galaxy,etc.), which contains a soundtrack and graphics. 

Independent writers will get the chance to publish their work through our project and every day a different genre will be available. 
From 'Monday Fantasy' to 'Crime Thursday', say goodbye to boring evenings at home when there’s nothing to watch on TV. And for the little ones, we will offer a special “Good night episode” each day! This way, there will be no more troubles on which bedtime story to choose at night.
Genres we will offer are the following: Crime, Fantasy, Romance, Sci-Fi, Horror, Lifestyle, and stories for Young Adults and Children. 
 
 

 
For Your Imagination
Now, just imagine reading The Lord of the Rings. Wouldn't you have loved to have some supplementary graphics to go with that book, such as a map describing the journey of Frodo and Sam? Wouldn’t it have been wonderful to have some background battle noises to dramatize the epic war scenes? 
Or imagine reading a bedtime story to your children. Wouldn't they be excited to see images popping up and hear lions roar in tune to the story-telling? Or the sound of waves when the explorers are travelling on a ship as you read about the journey? Well, we are excited just thinking about it. 

 
 

 
Meet the Team
Now, we’d like to introduce ourselves to you so that you’ll have a bit of a clue as to who you might be contributing your hard earned money to.
Senserial Publishing is a digital publishing house founded by myself, Christian Jorda, on January of 2012. Manja Haensel was brought onboard 2 months later and is now managing the content and marketing side of the project, whilst I am working out all the technical and financial details.

Website designer, Dimitar Dobchev, has put our plan furthermore into action by creating a fantastic website for our project.  
We and our writers have put in long hours to get this project ready for its launch and we are planning to have a full digital reading service by March 20th with our Spring Edition.

 
 
Why we need your help
We need financial help to maintain our website, pay the writers for their episodes, the composers for their musical work, the graphic designers for their images, and all of the other people working in the background, to finally realize what we’ve imagined.
To help us change the world of reading, you can pledge whatever you want. A few dollars or even a hundred will help us set the way.
We are grateful for every pledge, so please tell your friends & families as well and spread the word about this new reading adventure!

<p>Every character we have ever created is alive and well, living together in their own world. There is an economy of scale in which every Prince Charming is the same person, and every new story told about him just adds to his personality.</p>
<p>Sometimes that compound effect can drive a character beyond the edge of reason.</p>
<p>Join Princess Sophia from Grimm’s “12 Dancing Princesses” as she is given a task by The Storyteller to figure out what Prince Charming is up to and stop him from destroying their universe. <i>Less Than Charming</i> is the first novel of the Mark of the Storyteller series by Rebecca A.

Every character we have ever created is alive and well, living together in their own world. There is an economy of scale in which every Prince Charming is the same person, and every new story told about him just adds to his personality.
Sometimes that compound effect can drive a character beyond the edge of reason.
Join Princess Sophia from Grimm’s “12 Dancing Princesses” as she is given a task by The Storyteller to figure out what Prince Charming is up to and stop him from destroying their universe. Less Than Charming is the first novel of the Mark of the Storyteller series by Rebecca A. Demarest, in hardcover, launching in May of 2016 with Parkhurst Brothers Publishing.
Less Than Charming is launching with a huge party in Seattle, WA on May 14th, 2016, but we know not all of you will be able to make it there, so we're offering you this chance to pre-order the hardcover book along with some of the extras that will only be available at the party.


What People are saying about Less Than Charming:

















Pre-order with benefits! Less Than Charming is launching with a party on May 14th in Seattle, WA, but we know not everyone will be able to make it, so we're offering you a chance here to pre-order your hardcover books and get in on some of the fun extras we'll only have available at the launch. What are these extras, you ask? Wonder no more!

Cover Art Postcard

It will look great on the wall of your cubicle!

Limited Edition Full Color Map Prints


This is a draft and not the final version. We're still working on the final version. But when you GET the final version, you can frame it and keep it next to you and track Sophia's journey with monopoly pieces...or you can use it in a collage. Your choice.

Limited Edition Crown and Fredderpillar Rampant buttons



These buttons will make you the style envy of all your friends.

Thea of Oz and Zosozo in Oz


Get your hands on both, or, if you only want one, you can do that, too. Check out the ducal levels of backing!

And if we make it to $10,000 (gasp, is it possible?!) we'll include specially printed, high quality canvas bags with a design that you as a backer get to vote on.

I think one of the reasons suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people ages 10-24 is because we grow to believe that we are the problem and there is no place in the world for us; that being authentic is a death sentence.<br/><br/>I want to challenge that and help us realize there is enough room in the world for all of us exactly as we are.<br/><br/>While participating in Seth Godin’s Emerging Leaders program this past summer, I was told by multiple peers that my story resonated with them so much that I should write a book.

And that’s when I knew it was time to take the leap - I needed to write this book.<br/><br/>This book explores my journey as a queer woman who grew up with certain systems that didn’t include a place for my authentic voice. As I grew up I learned to hide my sexuality and my desire to learn about topics deemed “boys only.”<br/><br/><strong>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of self-discovery, the LGBTQ+ community, and abuse in both romantic relationships and the church through narratives like:</strong></p><ul>
<li>A Christian youth group “praying the gay away"" from me in response to my willingness to openly question my sexuality. What happens when vulnerability is met with judgment instead of curiosity?</li>
<li>The exploration of how I entered into an abusive relationship and the realization that I’d been conditioned to think I deserved unwanted attention. A look at the complicated feelings involved in finally leaving my toxic relationship.</li>
<li>Coming out as pansexual to myself and my new friends during an internship in Washington D.C. when I allowed myself to be more curious about what I wanted outside of familial and societal expectations.</li>
</ul><p>You will love this book if you are in the LGBTQ+ community, have struggled with abusive relationships, or are ready to question “the way things have always been done.” If you grapple with imposter syndrome and feeling like a misfit, <i>Señorita Pregunta</i> may help you find confidence in curiosity.<br/><br/><strong>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Señorita Pregunta</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</strong></p><ul>
<li>How do I feel more confident about my decisions when there are so many conflicting opinions about how I am supposed to live?</li>
<li>How do I communicate better with others by embracing curiosity instead of reacting defensively?</li>
<li>How do we get more comfortable asking difficult questions as a society without feeling more divided?</li>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p><i>Nevertheless: The Resilience of the Modern Woman</i> tells the stories of anything-but-ordinary women who have overcome the obstacles of contemporary gender norms and power relations to become leaders in their schools and fields.<br/><br/>Hi! My name is Jillian Giberson and I am the author of <i>Nevertheless</i>. Frankly, I never pictured myself writing a book. When I was presented with the opportunity to work with a program that supports first-time authors, especially university students, I thought, why not? What ensued was a rollercoaster of ups and downs, topic changes, and self doubt that eventually drove me to write what would become <i>Nevertheless</i>. It chronicles my experience of authoring my first book as a young female student and the complicated dynamics of gender relations in the 21st century. Throughout, I have included extraordinary stories of strength and perseverance of seemingly ordinary women who have confronted misogyny, harassment, and discrimination in their own respective fields.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be inspired by the stories of the remarkable women I have had the privilege of speaking with and learn how you too can and deserve to take up space. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to think deeper about contemporary gender norms. To think of times you have been made to feel weak or less-than and to affirm that you do deserve to take up space in your discipline and community. For men reading, I hope that this is only the beginning of an opportunity for you to help make space for female voices in your own fields. Above all, my goal is to give a voice to the survivor, the young activist, and the professional who has overcome innumerable obstacles in their career- the women whose stories would otherwise be left untold.</p>
</div><div>
<p>I wrote <i>Nevertheless</i> for young women who are the precipice of their academic or professional journeys, women who need to know that they deserve to take and make up space.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Nevertheless</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can I better take up space myself or help uplift female voices?</li>
<li>How can we collectively support women through an intersectional lens, especially in fields lacking substantial female leadership?</li>
<li>How can we challenge contemporary gender norms and power relations?</li>
</ul>
<p>I cannot wait to continue this conversation and hear of my readers’ own experiences.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs of publishing. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2020.</li>
<li>The Cover Design of the Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder</li>

<li>The Copyediting for the Book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this December</li>
</ul>
<p>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will be able to publish it. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also be able to publish an audiobook. And when I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition.<br/><br/>For those who pre-order my book now, I will provide early access to the Introduction and additional sections of the manuscript, with the opportunity to give me early feedback!

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>The Unlearning is a collection of poems written to personalize and normalize growth in regards to various belief systems. This is a creative piece of work that attempts to capture the thoughts and feelings associated with unlearning certain beliefs that have become core to one’s being. In this work, the author walks through her journey, highlighting the torturous valleys of disconnecting from a belief system and that community, as well as the beautiful mountaintops of liberation that are found on the other side.<br/><br/>Maddy Garrett wrote this book because she knows that the process of unlearning a religious belief system can be daunting, challenging and lonely. By writing her story down, she feels that she is simultaneously healing her own wounds while also inviting others to explore and heal themselves. She wants others to know that it is completely normal to leave a religion behind, and it is acceptable for people to change and grow throughout their lives. Most importantly, she wants others to know they are not alone.<br/><br/>Maddy’s hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that each unlearning journey is unique, but that they all share a few common themes: confusion, pain, hope, growth and beauty. She want you to see this book as an opportunity to examine those beliefs which you find troubling, escape from the idea that you are bound to those beliefs forever, and learn how to accept, explore and heal your wounds, one small step at a time.<br/><br/>In this book, you’ll join her in using language to render distinct aspects of leaving a religion behind and finding immense beauty and joy on the other side through poems like:<p>Part I, Poem #10, which explores the many contradictions I found within Christian teachings that were fundamental to the beginning of my unlearning journey.</p>
<p>Part II, Poem #4, which captures the feelings associated with having one foot in the door of my religious community and beliefs, and one foot out the door and into the world of wild, endless possibility.</p>
<p>Part V, Poem #6, which breathes life and love over my body which I once thought I had to demonize and reject in order to live a pure and holy life.</p>
<br/>You will love this book if you have ever left or considered leaving a belief system behind, in search of something more true to who you are, or if you are curious about what this journey is like. The Unlearning speaks to those who have gone through an unlearning journey themselves and those who want to grapple with religion and fundamental belief systems in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, The Unlearning inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<p>How can I meaningfully create a life that I love, even if it means leaving certain beliefs or people behind?</p>
<p>How do I uproot myself from my community without losing my sense of worth and being in the process?</p>
<p>What does it look like to change and evolve without totally losing myself and my values in the process?</p> Maddy really looks forward to exploring these questions and beyond with her readers. Coming together and discussing change, growth, loss of community, body acceptance and the idea of truth will change us all for the better.<br/> <h3>The Book - The Unlearning</h3> The book is written in 5 Parts....<br/><br/>Part I, Growing Up In It, takes the reader through Maddy's adolescent days as a devout Christian, giving glimpses into some fond memories as well as some troubling experiences she had with the religion and the community she was surrounded by.<br/><br/>Part II, The Knowing, is written around the deep feeling that something was not quite right about the world views she held growing up. It invites the reader into the daily struggles and inner-conflicts she was trying to manage while still being a part of the faith community she grew up in.<br/><br/>Part III, The Letting Go, focuses on key moments and feelings that Maddy experienced as a result of deciding to let go of the religion she had loved, leaving behind a world of certainty. It touches on the pain and confusion of letting go as well as the first sight of light at the end of the tunnel.<br/><br/>Part IV, The Rebirth, is about the liberation, freedom, and happiness that she found on the other side of her unlearning journey. This section really brings the reader into intimate moments that shape the way she finally learned to love her thoughts, heart, and body.<br/><br/>Part V, What I Would Go Back and Tell Myself, is an uplifting section filled with poems that Maddy wishes she had read when she was in the thick of her journey out of faith. These words are meant to encourage anyone who may also be going through or has been through this journey themselves.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3> This book will be published with New Degree Press.

<p>For many years I have been the one who stays at home and held a place for others who were off achieving their dreams.  That is honorable work and I am glad for those I have supported over the years.  But now it is my turn to claim my dream.  Ireland is the land of my ancestors and a place that has called to me my whole life.  The stories, the music, the history have all spoken to me and have been calling me there.  Now I am ready to heed that call.</p>

<h3><strong>Supporting My Journey<br/></strong></h3>

<h3>All progress on the expedition preparations and vehicle build shall be narrated at <a href=""http://www.thiseuropeanlife.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This European Life"">www.thiseuropeanlife.com</a>.</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How did it start?</h3>
<p>My name is Miguel and I have a serious case of the travel bug! Ever since graduation from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2011, I started writing a blog called ""<a href=""http://www.thiseuropeanlife.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""This European Life"">This European Life</a>"", in which I narrate all kinds of experiences and thoughts I come across in my travels, mainly road-based. I liked the nomad lifestyle so much, I internet for half a year at a mechanical workshop, <a href=""http://www.burlingamemotors.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Burlingame Motors</a>, where I learned how to maintain and diagnose my own car as a step towards self-sufficiency when traveling.</p>
<p>This time around, with the little I have, I will be preparing for the mother of all road trips: the PanAmerican Highway, starting on August 18th in the little town of North Wales, Pennsylvania. From there, I shall embark on a one-year expedition across the American continent, volunteering for several non-profits in several countries, and documenting everything I find in the way to my final destination, Tierra del Fuego.</p>
<p>I will mainly write prose (diary-based) and poetry, take plenty of pictures of my progress, and take some video when circumstances allow it; publishing it online as I move across the land –obviously, when internet is available. Part of this media will be devoted to you, so keep on reading to see what perks you will get!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Cost and expenses</h3>
<p>I budgeted this one year of travel at $23,942, here is how its broken apart:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$1,500</strong> for the vehicle, a 1981 Mercedes wagon with the bullet-proof turbodiesel engine; an excellent combination of mechanical simplicity, fuel economy and durable construction.</li>
<li>
<strong>$2,500</strong> for any mechanical work / parts throughout the journey, starting with some modifications in the US. Obviously, having bought it at auction, it needs some work; mainly suspension upgrades to handle the feared bumps in the roads of Latin America, and some fabrication (brush guard, winch) to turn it into a perfectly capable expedition vehicle.</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,600</strong> in camera equipment. I plan on taking a Canon 60D, which is said to be an excellent platform, as well as a more portable point-and-shoot camera that is a little more discreet. This includes cards and all paraphernalia.</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,250</strong> in other equipment, mainly hard drives and computer and camera accesories to be able to keep and store all the media that I take on the way.</li>
<li>
<strong>$750</strong> in tools (wrenches, screwdrivers, jacks) and spares (belts, fuel filters), just in case. I have some tools of my own and can take care of small issues. </li>
<li>
<strong>$3,625</strong> in fuel, assuming the trip will be 20,000 miles at 24-25mpg.</li>
<li>
<strong>$2,335</strong> in border crossings, including passport stamping and the costly –yet unavoidable- container shipping at the Darien Gap (Panama to Colombia).</li>
<li>
<strong>$1,512</strong> in insurance, for myself (Nomad Health Insurance) and the car.</li>
<li>
<strong>$935</strong> in lodging, when I am not sleeping in my own car or it is not possible or safe to do so. Keep in mind, this is a year's worth of travel!</li>
<li>
<strong>$3,750</strong> for food and supplies (detergent, soap, medications just in case).</li>
<li>
<strong>$3,270</strong> in miscellaneous expenses, such as overlanding equipment (stove, roof tent, jerrycans for fuel and water...) and road ""surprises"" (breakdowns).</li>
<li>
<strong>$900</strong> for any fees charged by Indiegogo and Uncle Sam.</li>
</ul>
<p>From these $24,000 I would like to ask for 1/2 of that amount, $12,000. If I get over this amount, I will make some small changes to the route and make it more diverse –a visit to Uruguay/Paraguay, for example.</p>
<h3>The Perks!</h3>
<p>Obviously, you need to get something in exchange. Depending in the amount you donate, the perk will be different; however, <strong>all perks</strong> are guaranteed exclusive access to a private, <a href=""http://s1088.photobucket.com/albums/i331/Delibes/PanAmerican%20Expedition/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""password-protected photo album"">password-protected photo album</a> in Photobucket.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$1</strong>: a wholehearted thank you, and access to the online photo album.</li>
<li>
<strong>$5</strong>: a personalized email + Online photo album.</li>
<li>
<strong>$10:</strong> a postcard from the country of your choice + Online photo album.</li>
<li>
<strong>$20</strong>: a ""doodle card"" from the country of your choice + Online photo album.</li>
<li>
<strong>$50:</strong> a ""doddle letter"" from the country of your choice + Online photo album.</li>
<li>
<strong>$75:</strong> an original, written, large format ""photo-card"" + Online photo album.</li>
<li>
<strong>$100:</strong> a printed book with select pictures and quotes + Online photo album.</li>
<li>
<strong>$200:</strong> an acrylic/watercolor picture from any country + Online album.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, if you have a business you want to promote, I am renting body panels on my expedition vehicle to feature some publicity. Any of these perks is valid for one year, yet it does not cover the costs of making/installing the advertisement wraps:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$500</strong>: medium advertisement wrap on one body panel + Online album.</li>
<li>
<strong>$1000</strong>: a full body panel + Online photo album.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now, the MOTHERLOAD: if you organize a public/private talk about the journey, its preparations, artmaking, or the simple secret of doing what you like in life. These talks include basic air transportation; contact me before bidding on one of these.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$1,500:</strong> one-day talk/workshop in the US before I depart.</li>
<li>
<strong>$5,000:</strong> talk and workshop ANYWHERE ELSE in the world after the trip.</li>
<li>
<strong>$?????</strong>: Hire me after the trip as an artist or as a travel writer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose one perk or choose several! I am definitely open to the possibility of creating personalized packages to write to you from EVERY country in the route!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The volunteering element is just as important as all the art-making process. I strongly believe that strong life experiences should carry an element of social responsibility, as no human being is complete without his/her surroundings. These are some of the functions that I will be undertaking in the non-profits along the way...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Teacher</strong> (art, English, Spanish) for children from rough backgrounds.</li>
<li>
<strong>Builder</strong> of shelters and homes in communties.</li>
<li>
<strong>Researcher</strong> for environmental projects in Central America.</li>
<li>
<strong>Engineer</strong> for sustainable machinery that will empower impoverished villages.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mechanic</strong>... as I am sure someone will need a quick fix along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have experience volunteering in two different countries: Mexico (Door of Faith Orphanage) and Guatemala (Partners in Development, home building); these two experiences have made me come back for more!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In this economy I would not be surprised to see that your wallet is empty... no problem! There are many other ways you can still help!</p>
<ul>
<li>Facebook/Twitter the living heck out of this project!</li>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about this expedition!</li>
<li>Find any sponsors that can provide materials / supplies for the expedition and the communities that I visit. I will be most glad to give them free publicity!</li>
</ul>

I strongly believe that strong life experiences should carry an element of social responsibility, as no human being is complete without his/her surroundings. These are some of the functions that I will be undertaking in the non-profits along the way...


Teacher (art, English, Spanish) for children from rough backgrounds.

Builder of shelters and homes in communties.

Researcher for environmental projects in Central America.

Engineer for sustainable machinery that will empower impoverished villages.

Mechanic... as I am sure someone will need a quick fix along the way.

I have experience volunteering in two different countries: Mexico (Door of Faith Orphanage) and Guatemala (Partners in Development, home building); these two experiences have made me come back for more!


Other Ways You Can Help
In this economy I would not be surprised to see that your wallet is empty... no problem! There are many other ways you can still help!

Facebook/Twitter the living heck out of this project!
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about this expedition!
Find any sponsors that can provide materials / supplies for the expedition and the communities that I visit. I will be most glad to give them free publicity!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>We want to thank everyone for the tremendous support we are receiving, but we are not finished, yet! In our original campaign, we set our goal incredibly low, since no poetry group in Utah had ever made more than a few hundred dollars via online fundraising sites. And then we reached that goal in less than two weeks! We were amazed, but we still have a long way to go if we're going to make it to Boston. In actuality, we will need a total of $5,000 to cover all the expenses. So, we've started this new campaign to avoid any confusion. Thank you for all your continued support! We love you already just for clicking on the links to get you here!!</p>
<h3>What We're About</h3>
<p>We are the Wasatch Wordsmiths, a small group of poets voted via poetry slam to represent outer Salt Lake City, Utah, at the 2013 National Poetry Slam.  This unique group of poets, consisting of Joseph Kyle Rogan (JoKyR), Tami Porter-Jones, DeAnn Emett, Adam Love, and Gray, are joining forces and combining their unique writing styles to make the Wasatch Front and Utah proud!  We spend all year writing, performing and competing in our community. We also volunteer and perform for other organizations throughout the year to help further causes like The Road Home, The Rape Recovery Center, Slutwalk, and more.</p>
<div>
<br/>Now, we need your help to take our art to the next level. Help us get to Boston and compete against other teams from across the country. Help us show why the Utah poetry and art community is so phenomenal. You can help put us on the map!</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to make it to nationals, we have to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration ($500)</li>
<li>Plane tickets for five people</li>
<li>Hotel room(s) in the beautiful (but expensive) city of Boston</li>
<li>Food while we’re there, so we don’t starve (we are willing to eat Ramen Noodles to make this happen)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>Besides our undying loyalty and appreciation, we have set up a reward system for your donations that include chapbooks, souvenirs from Boston, and even a private show within 100 miles of Salt Lake.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you would like to request a specific Wordsmith to write a poem for you, or if you have any other specific requests, please leave a note in the comments section. We will do our best to honor all reasonable requests.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is the first time two teams from Utah will be heading to nationals. Members of the Wasatch Wordsmiths have previously represented Utah on semi-finals and finals stages at national events in the past.</p>
While attending the National Poetry Slam, our Wordsmiths will be attending clinics and workshops to improve as writers, performers, and community organizers.  Poets who are part of the Wordsmiths have already put in a lot of time helping out the community through teaching, workshopping, community action, and a variety of other ways, and attending the National Poetry Slam will teach us effective strategies and methods for positive growth in SLC and Utah.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Attend our local poetry slams in Salt Lake City, Riverton, and Ogden, as well as the U of U and Westminster.  Keep your eyes out for the various artistic events coming up, such as the Urban Arts Festival and the Utah Arts Festival. This site will be you source for updates on upcoming performances and events.  Many of us have chapbooks for sale individually, as well as an upcoming team chapbook set for release soon!</div>

L'objectif de Yepicaï est de promouvoir des artistes nouveaux ou émergents en Europe et en Amérique du Sud!
L'histoire commence en 2011 lorsque Yoann Purey, artiste multidisciplinaire ( photographie, graphisme, design. ), quitte Paris pour l'Amérique du Sud. Il tombe alors sous le charme de ce continent, de ses différentes cultures, de ses habitants et bien évidemment de son art et de ses artistes.
Pendant les 3 années où il y réside, il rencontre et collabore avec différents artistes. C'est lors de son retour en France pour quelques semaines qu'il réalise que le Vieux Continent connaît mal l'art sud-américain et sa vitalité.
Déjà créateur de modèles de tee-shirt en son nom, Yoann décide alors de voir plus grand et de créer une marque de tee-shirt, trait d'union entre l'Europe et l'Amérique du Sud.
Yepicaï naît donc officiellement en 2013 à Bogota où Yoann part s'installer.
El Proyecto:
¡ El objetivo de Yepicaï es promover a artistas nuevos o emergentes en Europa y en América del Sur!
La historia comienza en 2011 cuando Yoann Purey, artista multidisciplinar (la fotografía, el grafismo, el diseño.), se va de París para América del Sur. Cae entonces bajo el encanto de este continente, de sus diferentes culturas, de sus habitantes y desde luego de su arte y de sus artistas.
Durante los 3 años cuando reside allí, encuentra y colabora con diferentes artistas. Es en el momento de su vuelta a Francia para algunas semanas que comprende que el Viejo Continente conoce mal el arte sudamericano y su vitalidad.
Ya creativo de modelos de camiseta en su nombre, Yoann decide entonces ver en grande más y crear una marca de camiseta, guión entre Europa y América del Sur. 
Yepicaï oficialmente nace pues en 2013 en Bogotá dónde Yoann sale a instalarse.


Notre ambition:
L'objectif est de promouvoir des artistes en Europe et en Amérique du Sud en 2 temps:
1. En commercialisant en série limitée des tee-shirts arborant les créations du collectif Yepicaï via le site internet et via différents distributeurs en Amérique du Sud et en Europe.
2. Dans un second temps, en exposant ces artistes dans des galeries éphémères financées par les ventes.
L'idée étant d' offrir une dimension internationale aux artistes du collectif sur les 2 continents!
Nuestra ambición:
El objetivo es promover a artistas en Europa y en América del Sur en 2 tiempos:
1. Comercializando en serie limitada por las camisetas que enarbolan las creaciones del colectivo Yepicaï vía la página internet y vía los diferentes distribuidores en América del Sur y en Europa.
2. En segundo lugar, exponiendo a estos artistas en galerías efímeras financiadas por las ventas.
¡ La idea que es ofrecerles una dimensión internacional a los artistas del colectivo sobre los 2 continentes!


Notre engagement:
Notre engagement est de produire en Amérique du Sud des T-shirt fabriqués exclusivement en coton issu de l'agriculture Sud Américaine et particulièrement Colombienne.
Nuestro compromiso:
Nuestro compromiso es producir en América del Sur del Niqui fabricados exclusivamente de algodón nacida de la agricultura Meridional americana y particularmente Colombiana.


Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez:
Financé en partie par les économies de son fondateur, Yepicaï a encore besoin de votre soutien pour :
* lancer les premiers tests en usine environ une cinquantaine de t-shirts
* financer les premiers stocks
* concevoir et créer notre site internet
* à intégrer un flash code sur nos t-shirt 
Lo que necesitamos y lo que usted obtiene:
Financiado en parte por las economías de su fundador, Yepicaï todavía necesita su apoyo para:
* Lanzar las primeras pruebas en fábrica cerca de una cincuentena de niquis
* Financiar las primeras existencias
* Concebir y crear nuestra página internet
* Al integrar un flash codifica sobre nuestros niqui

     memoria de nuestros hijos.  Durante el acto las familias
     colocan una estrella en un árbol de Navidad en memoria de su hijo o hija.
     Esta actividad presenta a las familias un espacio muy especial para
     compartir empáticamente. Esta celebración fue oficialmente reconocida
     mediante la aprobación de la Ley Núm. 144 de 11 de junio de 2004, según
     enmendada, para establecer el segundo domingo de diciembre, el “Día de

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>I’m a graphic designer, photographer, crafter, website designer and Steampunk. My business of Candice Crafts already runs successful craft fair events throughout the year, most notably at the Deaf Trust in Doncaster. I work alongside my husband, Tony, who takes care of security and also handles the more technical aspects, such as setting up the PA system. I concentrate on the planning and then, on the day, I make sure everyone is happy and cater for any special needs.</p>
<p>Steampunk Doncaster aims to bring the many creative aspects of Steampunk to the notice of the wider public. The largest part of the 2 day event will be a Literary Symposium, entitled ‘Litarium’, at which authors can attend for free to promote and sell their books as well as engage in discussions and workshops with the public. We have some renowned Steampunk authors attending and will also be promoting literacy with the assistance of the local Library Service.<br/>Allied to this will be an Art Exhibition, entitled ‘Manifestation’.  All artists will be able to exhibit for free and they will have the opportunity to sell their works – the exhibition is open to all who wish to submit work. We also have other activities planned, to make the event enjoyable for the whole family, including artists workshops, gaming, photographic tuition sessions and much more. For visitor comfort and refreshment we will have tea and cakes in abundance (a necessity for Steampunks) as well as locally brewed beer and a Temperance Bar.</p>
<p>We’re not asking for loads of money, just enough to provide the basic necessities for the event to run smoothly. A little help can go a long way with an event of this scale.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>£1200 is what we’ve identified as being the absolute minimum we would need to run this event. This amount breaks down as follows:<br/>£270 for a fairground organ to attend for the 2 days, which will be an important element in drawing people to the site and add to the vintage atmosphere.<br/>£50 for printed flyers, these will be distributed in the town centre the 2 weekends prior to the event to raise awareness amongst the local population (we will be in Steampunk costume while doing this).<br/>£240 for a feather flag and 2 banners which will promote the event in the town centre and at the venue itself over the preceding month.<br/>£640 venue hire fee for the 2 days which includes access to free car parking for visitors.</p>
<p>We have an experienced Steampunk photographer joining us from Holland and bringing two of his female models in order to give photographic workshops to visitors. Perks will include free sessions with this team including image manipulation techniques. We also intend to have a range of ‘gifts’ donated by attending companies such as beer from a local micro-brewery. Many of the details are still to be confirmed, but all perks will need to be redeemed at the event itself.</p>
<p>Any funds raised, should there be a shortfall from the amount sought, will still go towards the running of the event, which will run. However, we may have to manage without some of the promotional elements, such as the fairground organ, which would be a massive shame.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Steampunk espouses the very best in behaviour and morals and also encourages creativity in all its forms. This positivity is sadly a rare thing these days and should be encouraged wherever possible. Doncaster is an area which has been identified by the UK government as being in special need of encouragement in creative arts uptake but the government are currently failing to do anything about it – so we are. We feel that Steampunk can be the means to at least start to correct this oversight.</p>
<p>We have been running craft fairs in this region since 2010 and have built a reputation for customer care and fairness. This event, while differing slightly from our craft fairs, is no different in scale or logistics and we feel confident that we can provide an enjoyable atmosphere in which visitors can explore the creativity of Steampunk.</p>
<p>Our ambition is for this to become an annual event for Doncaster and one with which local businesses can engage. We already have the support and encouragement of the local Council and have been promised the equivalent of £5000 in support in kind from them and other agencies. Please note that ‘support in kind’ means that we receive no actual funding from these agencies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>More details on the ‘Litarium’…</p>
<p>Craig Hallam, our Literary Co-ordinator and author of ‘Greaveburn’ will be hosting a workshop entitled ‘Creating a reality in fantasy’.</p>
<p>Jonathan Green, author of the Pax Britannia series amongst many titles, will be hosting a workshop entitled ‘Creating characters’.</p>
<p>Anna Chen, performance poet and author of ‘The Opium Wars’, will be performing her works.</p>
<p>Moore &amp; Reppion, creators of many graphic novels including ‘The Complete Dracula’ and ‘The Complete Alice in Wonderland’, will be hosting a workshop entitled ‘Telling your story visually’.</p>
<p>Rod Gillies, author of ‘Red Mercury’, and LM Cooke, author of ‘The Automata Wars’, will also be giving talks, subjects to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Plus, Allegra Hawksmoor of ‘Steampunk Magazine’ will be hosting a discussion entitled ‘The role of morality in Steampunk.</p>
<p>There will also be some creative writing competitions linked to the Litarium, for both children and adults, including a Steampunk Limerick Jam!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Please do your best to spread the word about our event, not just to any Steampunks you may know, but to anyone interested in the arts or even just curious about what Steampunks look like!</p>
<p>Use the Indiegogo share tools as well as Facebook, Twitter and other social networking to get people to come along.</p>

With over 6,000 visits to the site since it launched, we have received a lot of great feedback from the community. Our Facebook page, on average gets close to 1,800 views per week, and we're soon to launch our mobile application, which is in need of a stronger design platform.The biggest question we've received has been: where can I pick up a copy?Our initial goal was to print 1,000 to 1,500 copies of our magazine; however, due to high costs and lack of investors, we've had to keep things in digital-only format. We have been able to maintain our expenses for our website, and mobile app through advertising space in the magazine, but would like to expand further.We would like to expand our reach in the community, and help spread our positive message to the rest of the Treasure Valley.In the months to come, we want to take the magazine to print, and distribute it to locations around the valley. As of right now, we have over 20 locations around the valley who have offered to carry our publication once we are able to, and we hope to expand beyond these distribution points.This project has been a great success already, and we're excited that our first issue will be released on the 1st. We plan to bring a new issue out on the 1st of every month, and have a special issue planned for June, when we hit our 25th anniversary of Gay Pride in Boise. We hope to have our distribution to, at least, 5,000 physical copies by then.

<p>I have lived and worked with youth for most of my life. My
experience as a counsellor and as an advocate for youth has given me insight
into the developmental needs of our young people. I am the founder and director
of Street Spirits, a program for youth that has transformed the lives of
hundreds of youth over the past fifteen years. I hold a Master’s Degree in
Education from Simon Fraser University and have won numerous awards for my work
with children and youth including the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee medal
and the Canada Peace medal. I believe that we serve our children best when we
foster expectations of personal and community responsibility and invite them to
take a positive role in the world.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Over the past years our schools have suffered
increasing pressures to do more with diminishing resources. The wellbeing and
future of our children has been turned into a political bargaining chip with
little regard for the consequences. I want your help to change that. I believe
that we need to recognize the uniqueness of life in the North. Costs are
different and the needs of our children are different. We also live in a
changing world. Think of the jobs out there right now that did not exist twenty
years ago. Think of the shifting nature of our workplaces. Changes in markets
and in technology mean that what our children do for a living may be very
different from our experience.<span>  We need an educational system that prepares
our young people to adapt to that changing environment. Our schools need to prepare
young people for lifelong learning and to be a part of strong and connected
communities. We have among our school staff the people with the skills and
drive to create such a system. We need a school board with the vision and the
will to support the development of Twenty First Century Education. I am asking
the people of our Northern communities to support me with their votes in
November as a trustee for the Board of School District 57. To do that I need to
reach the people. I need to engage in the conversations and address the issues.
Doing so requires the funding to run a campaign. Please help to make our

Our impact...
 Meaningful Travel:  Our major sponsor for the trip is an organisation called GlobeDrop.  They are a free web application that allows travellers to connect and communicate with social welfare establishments and NGOs around the world. We hope to visit many of the NGOs and social welfare organisations as we go to highlight the great work the GlobeDrop is doing for these companies all around the world.  They are working with organisations in South, Central and North America.

Challenges ahead...

 We are not saying that it is going to be easy - but it is certainly going to be an adventure and a lot of fun. We are sure we are going to encounter issues and problems along the way but that is what we want to learn about and highlight for other travellers looking to do a similar thing.
We appreciate your support...
 We understand that not everyone is in a position to support our book or our cause. However if it is something you would like to support but are unable to assist with financially, we would appreciate you sharing it with others who may be in a position to do so, particularly corporations who would benefit in partnering up with us.  The Indiegogo sharing tools make it super easy.

Gatherer</b></p>
<p>So many people believe
that better health and more vitality is just a new diet or exercise fad away,
but research shows that doing one or both of these things for a short period of
time has little or no effect on our long term health. In order to lose weight
and keep it off and lower your risk of developing lifestyle diseases like
diabetes, heart disease, obesity and cancer you have to make a lifestyle
change. Our forefathers did not diet or exercise, yet they were thinner and had
fewer lifestyle diseases than we do today. I believe this is because
movement and real whole foods were the essence of our forefathers existence. The Modern
Day Hunter Gatherer is a road map to a healthier lifestyle that combines
ancient wisdom with modern research. This book gives you all the tools you need
to slowly and painlessly change your lifestyle and look and feel your best.
This book is filled with advice on:</p><p>How

and I am a wellness coach and personal trainer. I found my way to the world of
health and wellness after a college football injury left me a paraplegic at the
age of 20. I was confined to a wheelchair for nearly a year. It was a tough
time for me but after multiple surgeries and rehabilitation, I eventually made
a full recovery. This powerful experience lead me to a career in mind/body
wellness where I have trained Oscar-, Emmy-, and Grammy-winners, NFL and NBA
champion athletes and people from all walks of life. What Our Project Is All AboutThe Modern Day Hunter
Gatherer
So many people believe
that better health and more vitality is just a new diet or exercise fad away,
but research shows that doing one or both of these things for a short period of
time has little or no effect on our long term health. In order to lose weight
and keep it off and lower your risk of developing lifestyle diseases like
diabetes, heart disease, obesity and cancer you have to make a lifestyle
change. Our forefathers did not diet or exercise, yet they were thinner and had
fewer lifestyle diseases than we do today. I believe this is because
movement and real whole foods were the essence of our forefathers existence. The Modern
Day Hunter Gatherer is a road map to a healthier lifestyle that combines
ancient wisdom with modern research. This book gives you all the tools you need
to slowly and painlessly change your lifestyle and look and feel your best.
This book is filled with advice on:How
to eat like a Modern Day Hunter Gatherer (the healthiest food for modern
man) How
to choose the best produce, meat, grains, etc. that are best for your health and
your budget.How
to grow your own produce and herbs even if you have very limited space.Simple
and delicious real food recipes.Why sitting is killing you and what to do about it.How to be more active all day long, burn tons of calories the easy, no-sweat way, and still be both productive and more creative at work.Short
workouts that fit into your schedule and fitness abilities.Recipes for homemade natural household cleaning and beauty products that will
lower your exposure to harmful chemicals that can affect your health and even
make you fat.How to do all of this one step at a time.What We Need  Let's face it,
creating a high quality health and wellness book is expensive. We are new to
crowd funding and have set a modest goal of $2,000 but what we really need is at least $6000 to pay for things like:

declaration of impossibility. In Lebanon, you’re told it’s impossible to think.
In Egypt, you’re told it’s impossible to speak. In Palestine, you’re told it’s

</p><p>We started
The Outpost magazine in 2012, participating in a growing fertile terrain for
change. An Outpost is a remote elevated platform positioned at some distance
from a colony, used especially as a guard against surprise attack. It is a tool
for foresight. With The Outpost, we look past trends in creating a platform of
positive change. We are inspired by the World Makers that are constructing a
new sustainable and sovereign Arab world. </p>
<p>In our first
year in print, throughout four issues, we discovered an immense amount of
activity pushing our Arab world forward. Through the three sections that
comprise each issue: What’s Happening, What’s Not Happening &amp; What Could
Happen*, we uncovered narratives of change, highlighted situations that need to
be changed and imagined scenarios of possible change. In parallel, our network was growing. Our proactive Arab readers have picked up the flag of The Outpost
as one of the different flags of this revolution. Our growing international
audience is appreciating these new voices of the Arab world. We are part of
this proud, shameless and pioneering Arab youth that are changing their world
and rebuilding a new Arab world that is fit for their dreams. </p><p></p><blockquote><p>*We've uploaded the three sections of Issue 02 on <a href=""http://issuu.com/eebz/docs/the_outpost_2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">issuu</a> to give new readers a better idea about the narratives we publish.</p></blockquote><br/><br/><p><b><i><a href=""http://www.teardownthiswall.me/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Tear Down This Wall!</a> </i>is a call for action that we launched in an attempt to trigger thought about the walls that stand between the Arab youth and their possibilities. </b><br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FVlwcvFOlQA0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DVlwcvFOlQA0&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FVlwcvFOlQA0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><blockquote>

The Guardian

The Outpost
is a Beirut-based magazine about possibilities in the Arab world. We are a
‘magazine of possibilities’ when the narrative of where we live is a daily
declaration of impossibility. In Lebanon, you’re told it’s impossible to think.
In Egypt, you’re told it’s impossible to speak. In Palestine, you’re told it’s
impossible to live. In Tunisia, you’re told it’s impossible to win. In Saudi
Arabia, you’re told it’s impossible to grow. In Syria, you’re told it’s
impossible to survive.
We started
The Outpost magazine in 2012, participating in a growing fertile terrain for
change. An Outpost is a remote elevated platform positioned at some distance
from a colony, used especially as a guard against surprise attack. It is a tool
for foresight. With The Outpost, we look past trends in creating a platform of
positive change. We are inspired by the World Makers that are constructing a
new sustainable and sovereign Arab world. 
In our first
year in print, throughout four issues, we discovered an immense amount of
activity pushing our Arab world forward. Through the three sections that
comprise each issue: What’s Happening, What’s Not Happening & What Could
Happen*, we uncovered narratives of change, highlighted situations that need to
be changed and imagined scenarios of possible change. In parallel, our network was growing. Our proactive Arab readers have picked up the flag of The Outpost
as one of the different flags of this revolution. Our growing international
audience is appreciating these new voices of the Arab world. We are part of
this proud, shameless and pioneering Arab youth that are changing their world
and rebuilding a new Arab world that is fit for their dreams. *We've uploaded the three sections of Issue 02 on issuu to give new readers a better idea about the narratives we publish.Tear Down This Wall! is a call for action that we launched in an attempt to trigger thought about the walls that stand between the Arab youth and their possibilities. The Impact
Nominated for Best New Magazine (2012) and Best Magazine Design (2012, 2013) at the Magpile Magazine Awards
Awarded two Gold medals by the Society for News Design - Middle East

“The Outpost is my new favorite magazine. It is, overall, an impressive package—interesting and relevant reportage, beautiful design and graphics, with a mission to make change in a volatile, emerging region. Even if you aren't much interested in changing the Arab world, this magazine will make you think about where you personally stand and, through its stories and reports, make you think about what is possible in your life.”         — Dan Rowden, Founder, Magpile“The Outpost feels like a successor to the Economist.”           — John O'Reilly, The Guardian ""You rekindled a dream I had, and made me believe again in the future, I felt connected and somehow it wasn't just us, but everyone you were writing about felt exactly the same. In every single interview I have had, they asked me what made you start Rowayat... The answer is simple .... The Outpost.""            — Sherine el-Banhawy, Founder of Rowayat, a new literary                       publication from Egypt""It's a great thing you're doing, it's a revolution what 
you're writing ... 
Where will [the young] see the space for them to grow, if they don't want the 
old ways anymore? I think and hope they'll find it in you. When I sat 
and read the magazine I knew this was a great thing you were doing, and 
it's not about the paper and the design for me though they are the best 
you've picked. The thing that gets me is the words, the man walking away
 from the border on page thirty after not having enough cigarettes to 
get through killed me, and the sex story at the back warmed me, I sat 
there in a coffee shop and your pages breathed...""           — Adnan Sarwar, winner of the Bodley Head/Financial Times Essay Prize“Two-thumbs up!”            — Tyler  Brûlé, Editor in Chief, MonocleBelow is a really awesome video review we received from Steve Watson, the man behind The Stack.

<p>My name is Brian McCracken. I am a spoken word artist, educator, and organizer based out of Olympia, WA. If you know me or know my work, you might be aware that I am a member of Old Growth Poetry Collective, which I founded in 2011, which hosts regular poetry open-mics, poetry slams and poetry ""play shops"" here in Olympia. We also just wrapped up our Cascadia Cross-Pollination Tour, performing in Eugene, Portland, Seattle and Bellingham and making connections with performance poetry communities there. This past summer, I won a place on the Seattle Poetry Slam Nationals Team and competed with my team at the National Poetry Slam in Oakland, where we made semi-finals and were ranked #8 in the nation.</p>
<p>These two recent events have struck a new chord of desire in me to expand my work in the world of performance poetry and start a small business doing performance poetry education and performing services, such as graphic design, for other poets in the community. I have begun classes with Enterprise for Equity, a micro-loan and business training program for low-income folks here in Olympia to get some of those business skills. I already have two contracts in the works for teaching performance poetry, and will be approaching more organizations after the holidays. I'd like to dedicate myself full time to starting this business, and for that I need you.</p>
<p>During this time I will also be working on my manuscript for my first poetry book, If A Caterpillar Flaps Its Wings, and submitting poems to journals and periodicals. And start getting my work more published in the print world in general.</p>
<p>I'm super amped about this whole journey! All the work I've been doing in the Pacific Northwest with performance poetry has been leading to this point, and I'm excited and nervous at the undertaking, but I know this is what I need to do right now!</p>

<h2>Book Now On Sale!</h2>
<p>The book is now <a href=""https://leanpub.com/fljs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">for sale on Leanpub</a>! You can also <a href=""https://github.com/getify/functional-light-js"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">read the book for free on the Github repo</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>UNLOCKED!!! $10,000</strong>: I will record (after the book ships) and publicly release a series of ~5 minutes videos, one per main book chapter (expected 10 chapters for now).<br/><br/>These chapter highlight videos will illustrate/explain some example or part of that chapter in detail. <strong>All backers</strong> will get early access to these videos before they're finished and ready for the general public.</li>
<li>
<strong>UNLOCKED!!! $16,400</strong>: I will give every backer a PDF (ebook) copy of each of the six titles in my YDKJS book series.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Book</h2>
<p>This book explores the core principles of functional programming (FP) that can be applied to JavaScript. But what makes this book different is that we approach these principles without drowning in all the heavy mathematical notation and terminology.</p>
<p>At the time of campaign launch,<strong> </strong>the <strong><a href=""https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS#book"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">book writing is more than 6 chapters draft-complete</a>; </strong>at about 78 pages, I estimate it's <strong>over 50% done</strong>. If you'd like to see whether the book will be useful, judge for yourself: <a href=""https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS#book"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">go read</a> what's there so far.</p>
<p>Let's face it: unless you're already a member of the FP cool kids club (I'm not!), a statement like, ""a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors"", just doesn't mean anything useful to us.</p>
<p>That's not to say the terms are meaningless. Once you graduate from Functional-Light, you'll maybe/hopefully want to study FP more formally, and you'll certainly receive plenty of exposure to what they mean and why.</p>
<p>But behind all that noise, there's a wealth of <strong>powerful concepts</strong> that all programmers can and should be using to bring their code up from merely working to <strong>readable</strong> and <strong>maintainable</strong>. I call this perspective ""Functional-Light JavaScript"".</p>
<p>I want you to be able to apply some of these important fundamentals of FP to your JavaScript <strong>now</strong>, because I believe it will help you write better, more reasonable code.</p>
<p>By the way, ""Light"" doesn't mean easy, beginner, or intro; it means limited in scope. In the spirit of my prior <a href=""https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YDKJS books</a>, we'll be diving quite deeply into this rather narrow list of topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function Inputs/Outputs</li>
<li>Composition</li>
<li>Pure Functions (No Side Effects)</li>
<li>Value Immutability</li>
<li>List Operations</li>
<li>Recursion</li>
<li>Async Functional Programming... and more!</li>
</ul>
<h3>In The Open</h3>
<p>One of the most important details that distinguishes this book writing and publishing from many others is that I'm doing it <strong><a href=""https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">entirely in the open</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Not only can you read every word of the book online, you can do so while I write them. That means you get the material as soon as it's written, no delays. It also means you get to learn along with me, as you see words and code snippets not just written the first time, but revised and clarified and improved. The issue thread and commit history will permanently tell the story of how I learned FP and shared it with others; hopefully that will <strong>help others learn even more richly</strong>.</p>
<p>And the openness doesn't stop there. The whole process of preparing the book for publishing is going to be managed in the open. My strategic editor, tech editor, copy editor, etc -- all of them will be working in the open directly on the book material. That means we also learn better what exactly it takes to get a book finished. I hope more developers are inspired to write once they see what the process was like for me.</p>
<p>But I'm even going one step further: <strong>radical openness</strong>, if you will. I will be posting information (as appropriate) on the economics behind the book. You'll see how it plays out and what the dollars look like, not just of this campaign but of all the sales of the book.</p>
<h2>Why Me?</h2>
<p>Why am I writing this book? Because I want to finally learn practical functional programming. All the times I've tried to do that through existing resources, I got lost and mixed up with notation and terms, and I had no idea where to turn next. This book represents my unfolding learning-journey into FP, and I invite everyone to come along with me.</p>
<p>Many people know that I'm a full-time JavaScript teacher; I travel all over the world teaching developers of all sorts how to understand JavaScript more deeply. I'm also a published author (specifically of the <a href=""https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""You Don't Know JS"" book series</a>). Some reasons why I'm the person to write this book:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>7</strong> <a href=""http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/4853"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">published books</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>19+</strong> yrs software development experience</li>
<li>
<strong>4</strong> yrs full-time teaching experience</li>
<li>
<strong>250+</strong> days in corporate training classrooms</li>
<li>
<strong>170,000+</strong> hrs watched of my <a href=""https://frontendmasters.com/kyle-simpson/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">on-demand video training courses</a>

<p>In the past, I worked with a traditional publisher to handle the publishing of my books. This time, however, I'm self publishing. This of course brings in a whole slew of complications that I've not had to deal with, and costs a fair bit of upfront money before I ever see the first $1 sold.</p>
<p>Because I am forming this content into a book instead of just a bunch of informal blog posts, I feel you the reader deserve a top-quality end result. That means I need to hire strategic editor(s), technical editor(s), copy editor(s), and even artist(s).</p>
<p>I'm running this campaign to ask you to help me cover these up front costs, as well as my time to write the book as quickly as I can. I have to split my time with paid teaching, but these funds will in part help me carve out time to finish the book ASAP.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm asking for your help to support my process. As you'll see in the rewards, many levels include you getting a free copy of the ebook. This book will be in a professionally edited, typeset format. As I said, the content in its raw form will remain in the open and free to read (markdown format). But you'll get the best reading experience from the published book, and backers of this campaign will be the first to get them!</p>
<p>Rewards here will include digital ebooks (not print), because I'm going to keep costs and time down and not do physical rewards. I expect and hope there will be print versions of the books available for sale. <strong>All backers that get an ebook copy will get an exclusive deep discount</strong> on paper copies if/when they are eventually available.</p>
<p>I'm also offering some higher-level rewards if you'd like to combine the book with some of my teaching or consulting. These prices are as much as <strong>70% lower</strong> than my normal billing rates, so you'll definitely want to take advantage of them!</p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Based on sales and traffic numbers on the <a href=""https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YDKJS repo</a>, I estimate I've reached as many as 100k JS developers. Those books have been translated into at least 5 other languages, and sold in more than 30 countries. I expect that most of the audience of YDKJS will eventually be readers of this book, and hopefully perhaps even more.</p>
<p>Helping me write/publish this book means a truly world-wide audience will be impacted positively by your generosity and support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The most obvious risks are that I've never self-published before, so wading through those details is going to be a decent undertaking. I'm obsessive about the quality of the end product, so it's entirely possible these hiccups will delay final publishing beyond what I'd like.</p>
<p>My goal is to have the writing of the book done and publishing under way by the end of the year. I think this is a reasonable goal, since the book is already (at time of campaign launch) <strong>more than 50% draft written</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm going to keep rewards to digital form only, so as to avoid any risks of cost or time delays for physical rewards.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I would love and be deeply honored if you could give even <strong>$1</strong> to support this campaign.</p>
<p>But if you're looking for other ways to help, I would greatly appreciate you spreading the word about this campaign, on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, or any other channel you prefer. You could even share it on Google+, if that's still a thing people use. :)</p>
<p>You can also help by reading the book content as it rolls out. Your eyeballs will help spot places where my explanations need improving. I would love your suggestions on improving the text.

Stretch Goals


UNLOCKED!!! $10,000: I will record (after the book ships) and publicly release a series of ~5 minutes videos, one per main book chapter (expected 10 chapters for now).These chapter highlight videos will illustrate/explain some example or part of that chapter in detail. All backers will get early access to these videos before they're finished and ready for the general public.

UNLOCKED!!! $16,400: I will give every backer a PDF (ebook) copy of each of the six titles in my YDKJS book series.

The Book
This book explores the core principles of functional programming (FP) that can be applied to JavaScript. But what makes this book different is that we approach these principles without drowning in all the heavy mathematical notation and terminology.
At the time of campaign launch, the book writing is more than 6 chapters draft-complete; at about 78 pages, I estimate it's over 50% done. If you'd like to see whether the book will be useful, judge for yourself: go read what's there so far.
Let's face it: unless you're already a member of the FP cool kids club (I'm not!), a statement like, ""a monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors"", just doesn't mean anything useful to us.
That's not to say the terms are meaningless. Once you graduate from Functional-Light, you'll maybe/hopefully want to study FP more formally, and you'll certainly receive plenty of exposure to what they mean and why.
But behind all that noise, there's a wealth of powerful concepts that all programmers can and should be using to bring their code up from merely working to readable and maintainable. I call this perspective ""Functional-Light JavaScript"".
I want you to be able to apply some of these important fundamentals of FP to your JavaScript now, because I believe it will help you write better, more reasonable code.
By the way, ""Light"" doesn't mean easy, beginner, or intro; it means limited in scope. In the spirit of my prior YDKJS books, we'll be diving quite deeply into this rather narrow list of topics:

Function Inputs/Outputs
Composition
Pure Functions (No Side Effects)
Value Immutability
List Operations
Recursion
Async Functional Programming... and more!

In The Open
One of the most important details that distinguishes this book writing and publishing from many others is that I'm doing it entirely in the open.
Not only can you read every word of the book online, you can do so while I write them. That means you get the material as soon as it's written, no delays. It also means you get to learn along with me, as you see words and code snippets not just written the first time, but revised and clarified and improved. The issue thread and commit history will permanently tell the story of how I learned FP and shared it with others; hopefully that will help others learn even more richly.
And the openness doesn't stop there. The whole process of preparing the book for publishing is going to be managed in the open. My strategic editor, tech editor, copy editor, etc -- all of them will be working in the open directly on the book material. That means we also learn better what exactly it takes to get a book finished. I hope more developers are inspired to write once they see what the process was like for me.
But I'm even going one step further: radical openness, if you will. I will be posting information (as appropriate) on the economics behind the book. You'll see how it plays out and what the dollars look like, not just of this campaign but of all the sales of the book.
Why Me?
Why am I writing this book? Because I want to finally learn practical functional programming. All the times I've tried to do that through existing resources, I got lost and mixed up with notation and terms, and I had no idea where to turn next. This book represents my unfolding learning-journey into FP, and I invite everyone to come along with me.
Many people know that I'm a full-time JavaScript teacher; I travel all over the world teaching developers of all sorts how to understand JavaScript more deeply. I'm also a published author (specifically of the ""You Don't Know JS"" book series). Some reasons why I'm the person to write this book:


7 published books


19+ yrs software development experience

4 yrs full-time teaching experience

250+ days in corporate training classrooms

170,000+ hrs watched of my on-demand video training courses


100+ conference talks

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Nagano murió cruzando las vías del tren, desde entonces habla a través de un gato que se quedó a vivir en el paso a nivel después de aquel día. Su hermana, Sukue, escapa del dolor carteándose con un desconocido a kilómetros de distancia. El vecino de al lado, que vive obsesionado con la anciana de los paseos nocturnos, está esperando la oportunidad de su vida para coger el último tren a casa. Y entretanto, un hombre afianzado a sus recuerdos como método de supervivencia, planea sus momentos finales antes de suicidarse. Este es un libro escrito con retazos de momentos porque al fin y al cabo así es como está confeccionada la vida y así es como nos unimos a la de los demás, entrelazando nuestros caminos. Una novela acerca de cómo el amor, la autocompasión y el perdón pueden ir llenando todos nuestros vacíos.</p>

Un amor que vivieron también mis escritos, puesto que se han nutrido de la Psicología para enriquecer su trasfondo y ayudar además a que puedan cumplir una labor de conciencia social.

<h3>How Did This Happen?</h3>
<p>I don't know! I truly never thought I'd be doing this work, let alone teaching it, let alone writing a BOOK about it, but here I am and I'm so grateful for the opportunity to share the tools and awareness that has changed my life and helped my clients and students change their lives.</p>
<h3><strong>Here's What the Deal Is</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>The manuscript is complete. It's been through re-working, rewriting, and three rounds of edits. It's been proofread. It's been laid out and formatted with the illustrations. My editor and I are currently reviewing the printed galley proof to make sure it's all good to go. After making a few minor adjustments it will be sent to the publisher. This is where you come in!</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting the first 100 copies printed, ebook conversion, distribution to major outlets, plus online print-on-demand service will cost $1300. (Actually, it will be a bit more, but I like the number 13.)</li>
<li>If you're willing to help chip in, I'm willing to give you awesome discounted services! Check out the perks. I'm also open to creating custom service packages and gift certificates.</li>
<li>If I reach the goal of raising all $1300 here, I will print more copies, if not, I will get the money some other way. I WILL publish this book no matter what, so if you buy a book perk, you will receive it AND at a discounted price at that!</li>

<h3>This Book Is A Gift</h3>
<p>It's been a gift of healing for me and it's also a gift of healing for the world. There is a ton of love and magic in every part. It is my intent that the energy it holds will anchor the frequency of love anywhere it is. I am actively working with the trees to honor what they are contributing, too, so that it can be a healing for the realms of nature as well as of humans.</p>
<p>When you contribute, you get healing for yourself and are supporting a mission of healing the insanity of the world, one small change at a time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't support with a financial contribution at this time, you can still help by sending good vibes, visualizing this happening with total ease, sharing this with friends who might be interested, posting about it, or sending me a love note of encouragement.</p>
<p>It all really does help and it all means the world to me.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading and supporting this cause. I love and appreciate you.</p>

<p>The biggest motivation in creating this outrageous story was the notion that we could change the dreaded ""bedtime routine"" into an event filled with laughter and education. An experience where both the parent and child could learn interesting facts while simultaneously being entertained by a lovable feline with a passion for art. Instilling a passion for fine arts at a young age encourages children to take a step back from technologies and indulge in the world around them; appreciate museums, architecture, draw a picture, or explore the unknown. This story encourages children to question the possibilities of true events and lets their minds wander.</p>
<p><strong>Support artists supporting reading!</strong> Listen to the songs, partake in the activity book, watch Mr. E's dance video, and share in a lasting experience that is much more than a standard book. The character of Mr. E is inspired by the personality of a cat named Numuel-E-Nuts, owned by Alec's uncle, while his likeness is based on Jill's cat, Grim-Reaper. Alec is keeping his uncle's memory alive and following his uncle's aspirations to one day have a story about cat-shenanigans. Jill is fulfilling her grandparent's request to keep drawing and pursuing the arts. </p>

<p>Mr. E's Catastrophes is an adventure-packed dive into history. Mr. E is a time-traveling cat who inadvertently contributes to some of the most famous works of art and unsolved mysteries.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Strawberries Under Skin</i> is a collection of poems that explores the intersection of love, loss, and healing. A poignant read, this book reveals what it means to be a young girl on a journey towards growth and self-discovery through some of the most critical transitions in her life.<br/><br/>My name is Niharika Shah and I am the author of <i>Strawberries Under Skin</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted my readers to discover the courage to be vulnerable in the face of love and grief. I want this book to be a reminder to all readers that they are not alone in this journey of being broken down and putting themselves back together.</p>
<p><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will feel liberated. Having grown up in a typical middle-class Indian family, I realize that women are often stigmatized for being “too emotional” or “too soft,” and it is my lifelong dream to become one of the leading female authors of my country and drive change. I hope that this book inspires you to be true to your emotions and invites you to be unapologetically yourselves.</p>
<p>In this book, you’ll join me in exploring the depth of language and writing styles through poems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>“paper boat hats” which explores the intimacy between two people as they question the purpose and limits of their relationship.</li>
<li>“aubade for the wrong (kind of) love” which encapsulates all the different forms in which ‘love’ has appeared to the speaker, and all the ways it has failed her.</li>
<li>“castles are also called ruins” which manipulates white space to replicate internal disintegration.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are seeking refuge from anxiety or turbulent relationships, if you describe yourself as soft, with a ‘love conquers all’ kind of attitude, or if you are drawn to contemporary poetry.<br/><br/><i>Strawberries Under Skin</i> speaks to young adults who want to grapple with emotional trauma and self-love through the healthy expression of art.</p>
<h3>The Book Structure</h3>
<p>This book is written in 3 parts or chapters dedicated to three different entities or notions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Chapter 1: </strong><i>To You</i> is a tribute to the you of this book, an entity that the speaker has loved and lost. It explores the themes of love, romance and heartbreak.</li>
<li>
<strong>Chapter 2: </strong><i>To Me</i> is a tribute to the speaker or author herself — the <i>me</i>. For instance, in both “epilogue” and “you’ve loved before,” the speaker writes to and about herself, about growing out of a love that was confining and engaging with her choices.</li>
<li>
<strong>Chapter 3: </strong><i>To Change</i> is, as the title says, dedicated to the natural process of change, which includes change in the definitions of love, change in the mind and body and change in interpersonal relationships.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August 2021.</li>
<li>The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this summer.</li>
</ul>

Strawberries Under Skin is a collection of poems that explores the intersection of love, loss, and healing. A poignant read, this book reveals what it means to be a young girl on a journey towards growth and self-discovery through some of the most critical transitions in her life.My name is Niharika Shah and I am the author of Strawberries Under Skin. I wrote this book because I wanted my readers to discover the courage to be vulnerable in the face of love and grief. I want this book to be a reminder to all readers that they are not alone in this journey of being broken down and putting themselves back together.
My hope is that, in reading this book, you will feel liberated. Having grown up in a typical middle-class Indian family, I realize that women are often stigmatized for being “too emotional” or “too soft,” and it is my lifelong dream to become one of the leading female authors of my country and drive change. I hope that this book inspires you to be true to your emotions and invites you to be unapologetically yourselves.
In this book, you’ll join me in exploring the depth of language and writing styles through poems like:

“paper boat hats” which explores the intimacy between two people as they question the purpose and limits of their relationship.
“aubade for the wrong (kind of) love” which encapsulates all the different forms in which ‘love’ has appeared to the speaker, and all the ways it has failed her.
“castles are also called ruins” which manipulates white space to replicate internal disintegration.

You will love this book if you are seeking refuge from anxiety or turbulent relationships, if you describe yourself as soft, with a ‘love conquers all’ kind of attitude, or if you are drawn to contemporary poetry.Strawberries Under Skin speaks to young adults who want to grapple with emotional trauma and self-love through the healthy expression of art.
The Book Structure
This book is written in 3 parts or chapters dedicated to three different entities or notions.


Chapter 1: To You is a tribute to the you of this book, an entity that the speaker has loved and lost. It explores the themes of love, romance and heartbreak.

Chapter 2: To Me is a tribute to the speaker or author herself — the me. For instance, in both “epilogue” and “you’ve loved before,” the speaker writes to and about herself, about growing out of a love that was confining and engaging with her choices.

Chapter 3: To Change is, as the title says, dedicated to the natural process of change, which includes change in the definitions of love, change in the mind and body and change in interpersonal relationships.


What I Need & What You Get
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August 2021.
The cover design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)
The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this summer.

 
When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover and an audiobook.I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.
Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book.
You will receive early access to the Author’s Note and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.
You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.
You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.
And much more!

<p>This book came out of being an educator for over thirty
years, teaching cross-cultural communication, running a music studio for unique learners, and making everything I did to include the family and children with special needs. Over the years, I have shared this story in order to
teach the children manners in a fun way. The children loved it so much that I
had some writers and even some of the children work on it. It took on a life of it's own, becoming a deeper story about family systems and how to bring out the best in someone by
learning to appreciate, consider and respect differences. The manners served as
a bridge to feel comfortable anywhere you go.</p>
<p>As the story unfolds, the girls meet in
""Finishing"" and ""Unfinishing"" school, respectively. Amalia,
the perfectly behaved princess, gets to let it all hang out with Cornelia, the friendly Monster princess, at her home. They roller skate down the marble hallways on a mysterious concoction, otherwise
known as toothpaste, that slows them down just enough! While at Amalia's, Cornelia
gets to appreciate the benefits of ""fancy"" manners, including not worrying whether she is sitting
on squished grapes (typically occurring after food fights at her castle).</p><p>Here is an excerpt from the book:</p><blockquote>
<p><i>In the evening, the King and Queen tucked them into their beds and kissed them goodnight. “Sweet dreams,” they said.<br/></i><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">“You mean like chocolate and bubble gum dreams?” asked Corny. It was the first time anyone had ever said that to her, so she was trying to figure out what it meant.</i><i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>“Well, why not?” answered the King and Queen, amused again. They tiptoed out quietly and turned off the lights.<br/><br/>“That kiss felt smushy, but it was kinda nice."" </i><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">""Why were they tiptoeing out the door?” Corny asked. </i></p>
<p><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">“Just to be polite,” answered Amalia.</i></p>
<p><i>“Oh.” mused Corny. She couldn’t quite understand the rules and little rituals, but she did feel a safe, warm feeling when she fell asleep. </i><br/></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Both girls develop a tight friendship, which bridges their
differences and allows them to want to consider each others feelings. Amalia learns to think
outside of the box as Cornelia can do. Cornelia begins to enjoy the tender rituals learned from
Amalia that get her through her day more smoothly. These themes will be
further developed in the sequels that follow.</p>
<p>The story will be fully Illustrated by a wonderful local artist, Vicky Yuh. Vicky will be at the garden party as well as will provide you with prints and sign them there personally for those of you who contribute on a plus and plus-plus levels.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/488235/files/20140406140748-Book_page_copy.jpg?1396818468"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>

This book came out of being an educator for over thirty
years, teaching cross-cultural communication, running a music studio for unique learners, and making everything I did to include the family and children with special needs. Over the years, I have shared this story in order to
teach the children manners in a fun way. The children loved it so much that I
had some writers and even some of the children work on it. It took on a life of it's own, becoming a deeper story about family systems and how to bring out the best in someone by
learning to appreciate, consider and respect differences. The manners served as
a bridge to feel comfortable anywhere you go.
As the story unfolds, the girls meet in
""Finishing"" and ""Unfinishing"" school, respectively. Amalia,
the perfectly behaved princess, gets to let it all hang out with Cornelia, the friendly Monster princess, at her home. They roller skate down the marble hallways on a mysterious concoction, otherwise
known as toothpaste, that slows them down just enough! While at Amalia's, Cornelia
gets to appreciate the benefits of ""fancy"" manners, including not worrying whether she is sitting
on squished grapes (typically occurring after food fights at her castle).Here is an excerpt from the book:
In the evening, the King and Queen tucked them into their beds and kissed them goodnight. “Sweet dreams,” they said.“You mean like chocolate and bubble gum dreams?” asked Corny. It was the first time anyone had ever said that to her, so she was trying to figure out what it meant.
“Well, why not?” answered the King and Queen, amused again. They tiptoed out quietly and turned off the lights.“That kiss felt smushy, but it was kinda nice."" ""Why were they tiptoeing out the door?” Corny asked. 
“Just to be polite,” answered Amalia.
“Oh.” mused Corny. She couldn’t quite understand the rules and little rituals, but she did feel a safe, warm feeling when she fell asleep. 

Both girls develop a tight friendship, which bridges their
differences and allows them to want to consider each others feelings. Amalia learns to think
outside of the box as Cornelia can do. Cornelia begins to enjoy the tender rituals learned from
Amalia that get her through her day more smoothly. These themes will be
further developed in the sequels that follow.
The story will be fully Illustrated by a wonderful local artist, Vicky Yuh. Vicky will be at the garden party as well as will provide you with prints and sign them there personally for those of you who contribute on a plus and plus-plus levels.
The book's messages and it's humor is appropriate for ages 5-10, perfect for parents to read to
the younger ones and laugh together. Who knows, one or the other may start a
conversation about more ways to be considerate to others!This book is the first of three in the series as the story humorously continues to convey messages about manners, tolerance and ultimately, friendship to the enjoyment of children of ALL ages.
What We Need & What You Get
Our plan is to start out by self-publishing, so the money
would go to illustrating, binding and promoting the book. We will be sending it out to publishers once
it is tested locally, so there is a chance we will meet our goal of the book(s)
becoming known across the United States and ideally, in other countries.
For those of you who are able to contribute at the highest level, you will be
able to attend a party in my English garden, where we will grill luscious food,
hear the musical version performed live, and sing-a-long with me, the arranger and
perhaps the illustrator, Vicky, who will be brave enough to try another art form

<p>A.C. is a retired working class Italian who resides in the province of Rome.  He is married with two adult sons.  His wife is a retired custodial worker.  A.C. receives a pension but his wife does not.  A.C.'s wife worked for 15 years for the same company when a law was passed requiring one to work 17 years before becoming eligible to receive a pension.  Unfortunately, she was let go two years shy of reaching 17 years.  My friend is the elder of the two sons.  He does not currently have a stable job.  He has had random jobs but has not been able to find stable work for years.  His brother does have a stable job in public health. </p>
<p>In June of 2012, A.C. was diagnosed with lung cancer which was later found to be malignant, but that is not the reason for this campaign.  In the 1970s, A.C. made poor judgment when he decided to have a home built in a particular region for him, his wife and their two sons.  The mistake made more than 30 years ago has resulted in the family being in jeopardy of losing their home of 22 years.  The home is not in compliance with a couple of building regulations that were passed retroactively.  One law was passed in <a href=""http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.bosettiegatti.com/info/norme/statali/1985_0047.htm&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DLegge%2B28%2Bfebbraio%2B1985,%2Bn.%2B47%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1249%26bih%3D566%26prmd%3Dimvns&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TwI0UOmqM4bj0gHeqYCYDQ&amp;ved=0CF4Q7gEwAA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Law No. February 28, 1985, n. 47"">1985</a> and the other law was passed in <a href=""http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=it&amp;u=http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/deleghe/04042dl.htm&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DDecreto%2B%2BLegislativo%2B22%2Bgennaio%2B2004,%2Bn.%2B42%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1249%26bih%3D566%26prmd%3Dimvns&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=FAM0UIfmL-bH6AHOoIDQDA&amp;ved=0CF8Q7gEwAA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Legislative Decree 22 January 2004, n. 42 "">2004</a>.  Construction for the home started in 1977, completed in 1982 and the family inhabited the home in 1990. </p>
<p>Because the home was in violation of construction regulations, the family had to apply for a type of pardon.  They needed 3 separate entities to approve the pardon.  Only 2, the Common and the Province, approved.  The Superintendent of Architecture and Landscape denied the petition because of the retroactive laws, yet other families living in the same region were not denied.  A.C.'s family now needs to find a lawyer to re-appeal, but do not have the money to afford adequate legal representation.  This is the reason for the campaign. </p>
<p>The house situation is the latest in a series of challenges and trials the family has had to face.  With only one member of the family having a steady job and the family now having to pay for cancer treatment, my friend would greatly appreciate any amount of help.  The contributions would help increase the possibility of a successful appeal, to alleviate stress and would allow the family to focus more on the health and medical care of A.C.  A.C. and his family are law abiding and tax paying citizens who have lived their lives doing the right thing but seem to be given one bad break after another.  The contributions would also help my friend have more faith in humanity.  He was hesistant to allow me to attempt to help him in this way and is doubtful that people would care to help.  I want to show him that there are people in the world who do care.</p>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>My friend is asking for $13,000 ($12,500 for estimated legal fees and $500 for campaign fees).  If donations greatly exceed the goal amount, my friend will explore purchasing a new home to ensure that the family will not have to deal with this problem again.  If donations do not meet the goal amount, donations will still be used towards securing legal representation and paying campaign fees.</p>
<p>Thanks for your consideration and for your help!</p>

<h2>Introduzione e Storia</h2>
<p>AC è un ex operaio italiano che risiede nella provincia di Roma. E' sposato con due figli adulti. Sua moglie è una casalinga. A.C. percepisce una pensione, ma la moglie non lo fa. La moglie di AC ha lavorato per 15 anni per la stessa azienda, quando fu approvata una legge che richiedeva di lavorare 17 anni prima di acquisire il diritto a ricevere una pensione. Purtroppo, ha dovuto lasciare il lavoro due anni prima di raggiungere 17 anni perdendo in questo modo la pensione che  aspettava  lei di diritto. Il mio amico è il maggiore dei due figli. Egli non dispone attualmente di un lavoro stabile. Ha lavorato provvisoriamente finora ma non è stato in grado di trovare un lavoro stabile per anni. Suo fratello ha un lavoro stabile in materia di salute pubblica. </p>
<p>ad AC è stato diagnosticato un cancro al polmone che successivamente è risultato essere maligno, ma non è il motivo di questa campagna. Nel 1977, CA ha scarsa capacità di giudizio quando ha deciso di costruire una casa propria in una regione particolare per lui, sua moglie e i loro due figli. L'errore fatto più di 30 anni fa, ha portato alla famiglia il pericolo di perdere la loro casa dove sono vissuti per 22 anni. La casa non è in conformità con un paio di regolamenti edilizi che sono stati passati con effetto retroattivo. Una legge è stata approvata nel <a href=""http://www.bosettiegatti.com/info/norme/statali/1985_0047.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Legge 28 febbraio 1985, n. 47"">1985</a> e l'altra legge è stata approvata nel <a href=""http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/deleghe/04042dl.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Decreto Legislativo 22 gennaio 2004, n. 42"">2004</a>.

La famiglia AC ha ora bisogno di trovare un avvocato per fare ricorso, ma non hanno i soldi per permettersi un'adeguata rappresentanza legale. Questa è la ragione per la campagna. </p>
<p>La situazione casa è l'ultimo di una serie di sfide e prove la famiglia ha dovuto affrontare.

**UPDATE**
It is with sadness to report that A.C. lost his battle to lung cancer on Friday morning October 12, 2012.  The campaign will continue as his family still resides in the home.  Thanks to all who have donated thus far.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Sam Medina. I lived in New Jersey and Texas before moving to Toronto, Ontario, where I now work as a freelance artist, after having spent over a decade in the business world as a financial and business consultant.</p>
<p>As a writer (and artist), I have won awards for my webcomic series <em><strong>Jake the Evil Hare</strong>, </em>which tells the story of an evil rabbit gone horribly good. This series has consistently ranked among the top 6% on the major webcomic ranking sites. My fantasy webcomic, <em><strong>Darkfell</strong>, </em>as likewise been praised by critics and peers, and has hit the top 100 (top 0.5%) on TheWebComicList.com several times. It was, actually, where <em><strong>Dragonslayer</strong></em><strong> </strong> was born- it started as a short story I was writing to create a history for one of the major characters.</p>
<p>Dragonslayer is more than just my first fantasy novel. It is part of a much larger story, <strong><em>The Fetters of Wizardry</em></strong>, a somewhat dark fantasy epic which contains a sci-fi twist. It explores an ancient conflict between magic and technology and deals with the consequences of trying to manipulate history. One of my friends referred to it as 'Lord of the Rings meets Foundation.'</p>
What I aim to accomplish with this book (and I admit I'm swinging for the fences here) is to both produce a work of fine literature and lay the foundation for fantasy series so vivid, so thoroughly crafted that multiple authors will one day write novels of their own based in it... Somewhere between the visceral realism and literary majesty of H.P. Lovecraft and the expansiveness of <strong><em>Forgotten Realms</em></strong> is where I'd like to get to with the series, and you can help to make it happen!</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make this publishing venture a success, I'm going to need $9000 in start-up money. The bulk of these funds will be used for professional editing (about $2000) and the printing of 1000 copies (About $6,000). Fortunately I will be illustrating the book itself, and so that expense, at least, is eliminated.</p>
<p>I also have to pay for set-up costs of an online store, for various small formatting issues involved with ebook production, for stationery and postage to mail out copies of the book, and for the production and mailing of promotional materials to market the book once it’s been produced.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong><em>Dragonslayer</em></strong> will begin a new era in fantasy literature, in which magic and science come together and one world's history becomes the focal point for a conflict which spans millenia and many worlds.</p>
<ul>
<li>This will be the first of a series of at seven books, part of a story that has been growing in the back of my mind since 1994. A series of personal tragedies kept me from making headway into this tale up until recently, and I consider this the 'Great Work' of my life.</li>
<li>I believe it will set a new standard for fantasy literature, and it will be a very satisfying read for a wide variety of people.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of us had an experience
of buying a car. It's not one of the most pleasant ones. Every time you drive
out of showroom, there is a silent whisper of a devil in your ear:</p>
<p>""Somehow or the other,
I got ripped off.""</p>
<p>Well, not any more. </p><p><b>Why is it important to women?</b></p><p>Throughout the book writing process, I discovered some interesting and new information. Women have trouble buying a car; they often go to dealerships and get manipulated by salesman.</p><p>When I was first approached by my co-worker, I was in a bit of a shock: ""Luka, I am looking to buy a car and I feel like they are trying to screw me over in the dealerships. Would you mind going with me?""</p><p>I replied: ""Of course I am going to help you.""</p><p>A couple of weeks ago on March 18, 2014, Hilary and I went to several different dealerships in pursuit of a right car for her. After initial negotiations and test drive, it was time for some hard work.</p><p>I have developed a razor-sharp negotiations system that produces extremely effective results. The numbers are unbeatable: I did negotiations on Hilary's behalf and saved her $4,000! Congratulations Hilary! You are my first satisfied customer!</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FE1QzPFUbKks%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DE1QzPFUbKks&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FE1QzPFUbKks%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p>Even though the book hasn't been published yet, it already generates a substantial buzz in the community!

Ms. Riley recognized women's issue in car dealerships and suggested that I should organize educational seminars on the topic. I will be a speaker at 2 separate events, one in June, and the other one in July of this year.</p><p>One of the best perks women can use through this project is the <b>Peace of Mind Perk</b>.

<li>A
bit of planning can save you a ton of money when it comes to buying throughout
the year.</li>
<li>Therefore, the right timing will do a half of job for you.</li>
<li>When is the best time to buy a car?<br/>

<span><span></span></span>September and October are
usually months when new models start rolling out.<br/>
</li>
<li>Savings in these months can be
extraordinary.</li>
<li>December is a very good month as
well.</li>
<li>The worst time to buy might be
spring. (Everybody is buying a car in spring and summer.)<br/>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>For better savings, aim to buy a car at the end of the day.</li>
<li>One hour before dealership
closes is the best time to buy a car. Salespeople want to go home. Finance and
insurance personnel want to go to their families. Detailing department
employees want to go as well. It will be an easy buy, and they will lower the
price very quickly.</li>
<li>Buy when it’s very hot or very
cold, as people tend to stay home and there is no one to buy in the dealership.</li>

 write a book, I decided to write a traditional, hard cover book. I 
wanted to describe my experience in every single detail, but my vision 
eventually changed after doing some additional research and talking to 
several entrepreneurs.</p><p>This was their advice: ""Listen Luka, nobody
 is going to read a 100 page book on how to save money when buying a 
car. What you need to do instead is have a short and straight to the 
point type of book. 12 pages, eBook, bullet type of content, very 
visual.""</p><p>The challenge was to fit all that content into such a small book, so the final product is this:</p><ul>
<li>18 Pages</li>
<li>Clean, To-The-Point, Bullet Type Content</li>
<li>eBook Format</li>
<li>Visually Attractive</li>
</ul><p>Let's talk about what is in the eBook.</p><b></b><p><b>What is in it for you?</b></p>
<ol>
<li>When you learn how to save money,
you will have the opportunity to make your other dreams come true.</li>
<li>One of the many keys to saving money
when buying a car is to shop around.</li>
<li>

The eBook will deliver a
down-to-earth, step-by-step guide you need to have before heading to
dealerships.</li>
<li>In addition, before heading to car
dealerships, you need to do your homework.</li>
<li>You may think, “What the hell? I need
to do homework?” </li>
<li>

Let me put the issue in a nut shell:
the more time you spend on doing the homework, the more money you will save. </li>
<li>

I will teach you how to do it properly
and become an expert.</li>
<li>

With $5,000 I saved on my purchase,
I could easily book a trip to Bahamas, vacation in Mexico, a romantic vacation
at Bora Bora or go on a spectacular trip to Europe.</li>
<li>

So what would you like? Buy a car
and go on a vacation, or just buy a car?</li>
<li>

The problem with the dealership
experience, in essence, is following: it is designed to confuse you and wear
you down.</li>
<li>

Why? Isn’t it supposed to be fun,
enjoyable, and done in no time?</li>
<li>

In a perfect scenario, that would be
the way. In a real world? Well, no…</li>
<li>

Why do dealerships do this?</li>
<li>

Because when you are ready to buy,
you will be so tired that you will settle for any price that they offer you.
It's a wild west out there.</li>
<li>What should you do?</li>
<li>

Evaluate everything that the
salesperson is telling you.</li>
<li>

Be critical and inspect the car you
are looking to purchase.</li>
<li>

Be attentive and look for details.</li>
<li>

Ask as many questions as possible.</li>
<li>

Price-wise, the salesperson will most
likely focus on the MSRP or monthly payment.</li>
<li>

Don’t fall for that game.</li>
<li>

CAUTION: Do not let discussion focus
on monthly payment, as it gives dealership a lot of space for manipulation. </li>
<li>

You don’t want to overpay.</li>
<li>

FOCUS on the price of vehicle.
Period.</li>
<li>

You should set the ground rules.</li>
<li>

Politely explain that you know which
model and options you want.</li>
<li>

You have calculated what you are
ready to pay.</li>
<li>

You will buy on the spot if they can
give you price you want.</li>
<li>

Don’t disclose the price that other
dealerships offered you.</li>
<li>

Be friendly but confident.</li>
<li>

Be well-informed but not
argumentative.</li>
<li>

If they ask for a trade-in, let them
know that you first want to discuss and agree on the price of a new vehicle.</li>
<li>

Explain that you don’t want to waste
time, both theirs and yours, in lengthy negotiations.</li>
<li>

Let them know that you visited other
dealerships and gathered offers.</li>
<li>

Remind them that you are ready to
buy if they can meet your price. Otherwise, you’ll have to “think it over.”</li>
<li>

Go to at least five different
dealerships because at each and every one of them, you will learn something
new, something that the previous one didn’t tell you about.</li>
<li>

Stick to the plan.</li>
<li>

Modify your strategy if necessary.</li>
<li>

Never sign anything they offer you.
Sign only when you are confident this is the deal for you.</li>
</ol><p>With these few pointers, we
are barely scratching the surface of problems you will encounter in dealerships.
They also paint a picture of the mindset you need to have in order to get that
price down.</p><b></b><p></p><p align=""left""><b>Who am I?</b><br/></p>
<p style="""">My name is Luka Boric and I
am a media research professional. I have graduated from one of the top graduate
schools in USA, Rochester Institute of Technology, NY. Bla, bla, bla, booooring!
</p>
<p><b><b><b>Let's talk about me</b></b></b></p>
<p>Before we get into the project itself, let me tell you a bit about myself in a creative and entertaining way. Who am I?</p><p style="""">I am Luka. No, not that Luka! You were thinking of Dr. Luka Kovac from ER series. No, not him. Oh, you are thinking about other Luka, Luka Modric - that player from Real Madrid! No, not him either. But we all have 2 things in common: our name is Luka and we come from Croatia.</p>
<p>This Luka loves entrepreneurship
because it enables you to have a meaningful impact on the world, but is also gives you the true
power to change people’s lives. The corporate world is just not my thing. I like to work and create new opportunities
for people around me. I think we should talk.</p>
<p>I get excited about small
things: like making a tasty lunch, smiling to a stranger or reading John
Grisham’s book. One of the most exciting things I have seen is green ketchup!<b><br/></b></p><p><b><b>What do I like?</b><br/></b></p><p>You can call me a serial
hobbyist. There are so many interesting and creative things you can do in this
world. I love music. I have been playing piano for 23 years and I am thrilled by the amount of fun and creativity you can have with it! You can be creative with pretty much anything you do. Writing a book is a
creative process. Creativity is beautiful because it moves people; it makes
their life empowered, interesting, and optimistic. </p>
<p style="""">That’s the reason why I do
creative projects and why there is such passion for entrepreneurship. Through
this type of work I have met many extraordinary, smart, and inspirational, yet
mysterious individuals. And I am still blown away.</p>
<p>I like spending time with
interesting people who love to share their experiences and ideas. You are
probably one of those individuals. I love to travel. I love parties, EDM
festivals, movie nights, Internet, wing suit jumping, and many other things.
There are million things I want to do, try, and practice. Though, I am always
lacking one thing: time. There is just not enough time in the week to do
everything I like. There is even not enough time in a month, or a year. But, I
am trying.</p>
<p>I also love cars and as
well as entrepreneurship. These 2 passions actually inspired me to write an eBook
which will help people save money when buying a car. <br/></p><p>On one hand, I am a tough
and skilled negotiator. On the other, I used to work as a salesman so I used
that knowledge when I was buying my car to counter dealership’s standard tips
and tricks they pull on people. The final result was plain to see: magnificent,
keep-it-in-your pocket savings of over $5,000 which equal to 20% of the car
value. Now, there is an eBook about it and you can do the same. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/452200/files/20140322124634-9.png?1395517594"" src="""" style=""width: 552px; height: 368px;""/></p><b><br/></b><p></p><p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Are you thinking about writing a book? Are you debating if it is cheaper to produce an eBook? Whichever road you take (you may ask me for advice on what's the best for your project) you will encounter various expenses that have never crossed your mind.<br/></p><p>I am pretty sure most people
think: “You are publishing an eBook, that doesn’t cost anything!” Let me tell
you, that is not the case.</p>
<p>Even I was surprised by the
fact that there are so many costs associated with publishing an eBook. The
publishing costs for this eBook will be between $1,200 and $1,400. Here is the itemized
breakdown of costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional
     cover design (very expensive)</li>
<li>Editing
     (reasonably expensive)</li>
<li>Professional
     formatting (quite expensive)</li>
<li>Legal
     consultations (quite expensive)</li>
<li>Tax
     consultations (quite expensive)</li>
<li>Music
     licensing (very expensive)</li>
<li>Video
     production (very expensive)</li>
<li>Indiegogo
     fee</li>
<li>Payment
     processing</li>
<li>Taxes</li>
</ul><p></p><p>The goal of
the Indiegogo campaign is to raise $1,800. It’s not a lot considering the high
costs, but it would be inspiring to see that number go way above the goal. 
The money will be used to raise awareness of ""getting ripped-off"" problem and connect people with solutions to it. <br/></p>
<p>What's going to happen if campaign doesn't reach the funding goal? If I don’t
reach the funding goal, you will still get your copy of the eBook! Collected funds
will go to cover the existing costs of publishing a book, but I also might buy
myself a beer. </p><p></p><p>Ok, let’s
talk about what you get! I have created a list of exciting perks that you can
enjoy!</p>

</ul><p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p></p><p>In this very
moment, there are more people on Facebook than there were on planet Earth 150
years ago. Sharing information is one the most important aspects of our daily lives.
We see each other. We hear each other. We share what we love and it reminds us
what we all have in common. This sharing is changing the way the world works
and improves our lives in many different ways. This flow of information is
creating a better life and new opportunities for all of us.</p>
<p>You have just found out about this project. If you keep
this information for yourself, you disrupt the flow. Nobody else can benefit
from it. If you share it, the flow continues. It leaves you in a happy and
empowered state. It creates a difference in someone else’s life.</p><p></p><p>I am very passionate about this project. I have been working on it for some 700 hours over the past 5
months. That's on average 4 and a half hours every day. I have been living it, I have been breathing it, and now when it is
published, there is even more work to do. If you want to write a book, let me warn you: this is not for quitters.<br/></p><p>This is the
biggest project of my life because it influences everyone! We all buy cars. One of the most
intriguing aspects of any creative project is the impact it will have on this
world. In the beginning, you tend to see the project as a personal achievement and
something that is important to you. As you develop it and learn new things, the
vision changes and becomes greater on many different levels than you originally
thought of. Finally, very soon you realize the project is so much bigger than
you because of the positive impact it will have on other people’s lives and
their friends and families. We can never benefit from withholding information from others.<br/></p>
<p>That’s the
reason why video for the book started with an inspiring quote:</p>
<p>“You are not
here merely to make a living. You are here to enable the world to live more amply,
with greater vision and with a finer spirit of hope and achievement.”</p>
<p>̴ Woodrow
Wilson</p><p><b>What’s the book going to do for you?</b></p><p></p><p>„Hacking a Car Purchase:
How I Bought a Brand New Car and Saved $5,000“ will repay itself at least 50
times on your next car purchase. Over the course of a lifetime, your savings
may reach an outstanding $100,000!!! By reading 1 book!</p><p></p><p>Finally, let’s talk about
the book price. The book is priced to reach mass market so that anyone and
everyone can benefit from it. It's cheap, as cheap as it can be. The average
price of an eBook on Indiegogo is $20. „Hacking a Car Purchase“? Only $5.</p>
<p>Buy. Share. Inspire a

out of showroom, there is a silent whisper of a devil in your ear:
""Somehow or the other,
I got ripped off.""
Well, not any more. Why is it important to women?Throughout the book writing process, I discovered some interesting and new information. Women have trouble buying a car; they often go to dealerships and get manipulated by salesman.When I was first approached by my co-worker, I was in a bit of a shock: ""Luka, I am looking to buy a car and I feel like they are trying to screw me over in the dealerships. Would you mind going with me?""I replied: ""Of course I am going to help you.""A couple of weeks ago on March 18, 2014, Hilary and I went to several different dealerships in pursuit of a right car for her. After initial negotiations and test drive, it was time for some hard work.I have developed a razor-sharp negotiations system that produces extremely effective results. The numbers are unbeatable: I did negotiations on Hilary's behalf and saved her $4,000! Congratulations Hilary! You are my first satisfied customer!Even though the book hasn't been published yet, it already generates a substantial buzz in the community! I have been invited to speak on the topic by Ms. Nikole Riley, Events Director at National Association of Women and Small Business Owners! Ms. Riley recognized women's issue in car dealerships and suggested that I should organize educational seminars on the topic. I will be a speaker at 2 separate events, one in June, and the other one in July of this year.One of the best perks women can use through this project is the Peace of Mind Perk. I will accompany you during the visit to car dealerships and negotiate that price on your behalf. That will save you thousands of dollars and believe me, you will be very, very impressed. You can order the perk on the right hand side of the screen.Let me show you how I did it.

Foreword by Ph.D.
A secret worth $10,000: FREE chapter from the book!
In real estate, there are 3 rules: location, location, location.
With buying a car, it's timing, timing, timing.
A
bit of planning can save you a ton of money when it comes to buying throughout
the year.
Therefore, the right timing will do a half of job for you.
When is the best time to buy a car?

Wait
until the end of month. (Dealerships will be trying to reach bonuses.)
Wait until the end of year. (Dealerships
will be trying to reach bonuses.)

September and October are
usually months when new models start rolling out.

Savings in these months can be
extraordinary.
December is a very good month as
well.
The worst time to buy might be
spring. (Everybody is buying a car in spring and summer.)


For better savings, aim to buy a car at the end of the day.
One hour before dealership
closes is the best time to buy a car. Salespeople want to go home. Finance and
insurance personnel want to go to their families. Detailing department
employees want to go as well. It will be an easy buy, and they will lower the
price very quickly.
Buy when it’s very hot or very
cold, as people tend to stay home and there is no one to buy in the dealership.
This is a part of chapter #6 and it's connected and interrelated with previous chapters. For better understanding you need to read the rest of the book.

Ok, show me more!eBook formatWhen I first sat on a journey to
 write a book, I decided to write a traditional, hard cover book. I 
wanted to describe my experience in every single detail, but my vision 
eventually changed after doing some additional research and talking to 
several entrepreneurs.This was their advice: ""Listen Luka, nobody
 is going to read a 100 page book on how to save money when buying a 
car. What you need to do instead is have a short and straight to the 
point type of book. 12 pages, eBook, bullet type of content, very 
visual.""The challenge was to fit all that content into such a small book, so the final product is this:
18 Pages
Clean, To-The-Point, Bullet Type Content

Let's talk about what is in the eBook.What is in it for you?

When you learn how to save money,
you will have the opportunity to make your other dreams come true.
One of the many keys to saving money
when buying a car is to shop around.


The eBook will deliver a
down-to-earth, step-by-step guide you need to have before heading to
dealerships.
In addition, before heading to car
dealerships, you need to do your homework.
You may think, “What the hell? I need
to do homework?” 


Let me put the issue in a nut shell:
the more time you spend on doing the homework, the more money you will save. 


I will teach you how to do it properly
and become an expert.


With $5,000 I saved on my purchase,
I could easily book a trip to Bahamas, vacation in Mexico, a romantic vacation
at Bora Bora or go on a spectacular trip to Europe.


So what would you like? Buy a car
and go on a vacation, or just buy a car?


The problem with the dealership
experience, in essence, is following: it is designed to confuse you and wear
you down.


Why? Isn’t it supposed to be fun,
enjoyable, and done in no time?


In a perfect scenario, that would be
the way. In a real world? Well, no…


Why do dealerships do this?


Because when you are ready to buy,
you will be so tired that you will settle for any price that they offer you.
It's a wild west out there.
What should you do?


Evaluate everything that the
salesperson is telling you.


Be critical and inspect the car you
are looking to purchase.


Be attentive and look for details.


Ask as many questions as possible.


Price-wise, the salesperson will most
likely focus on the MSRP or monthly payment.


Don’t fall for that game.


CAUTION: Do not let discussion focus
on monthly payment, as it gives dealership a lot of space for manipulation. 


You don’t want to overpay.


FOCUS on the price of vehicle.
Period.


You should set the ground rules.


Politely explain that you know which
model and options you want.


You have calculated what you are
ready to pay.


You will buy on the spot if they can
give you price you want.


Don’t disclose the price that other
dealerships offered you.


Be friendly but confident.


Be well-informed but not
argumentative.


If they ask for a trade-in, let them
know that you first want to discuss and agree on the price of a new vehicle.


Explain that you don’t want to waste
time, both theirs and yours, in lengthy negotiations.


Let them know that you visited other
dealerships and gathered offers.


Remind them that you are ready to
buy if they can meet your price. Otherwise, you’ll have to “think it over.”


Go to at least five different
dealerships because at each and every one of them, you will learn something
new, something that the previous one didn’t tell you about.


Stick to the plan.


Modify your strategy if necessary.


Never sign anything they offer you.
Sign only when you are confident this is the deal for you.
With these few pointers, we
are barely scratching the surface of problems you will encounter in dealerships.
They also paint a picture of the mindset you need to have in order to get that
price down.Who am I?
My name is Luka Boric and I
am a media research professional. I have graduated from one of the top graduate
schools in USA, Rochester Institute of Technology, NY. Bla, bla, bla, booooring!

Let's talk about me
Before we get into the project itself, let me tell you a bit about myself in a creative and entertaining way. Who am I?I am Luka. No, not that Luka! You were thinking of Dr. Luka Kovac from ER series. No, not him. Oh, you are thinking about other Luka, Luka Modric - that player from Real Madrid! No, not him either. But we all have 2 things in common: our name is Luka and we come from Croatia.
This Luka loves entrepreneurship
because it enables you to have a meaningful impact on the world, but is also gives you the true
power to change people’s lives. The corporate world is just not my thing. I like to work and create new opportunities
for people around me. I think we should talk.
I get excited about small
things: like making a tasty lunch, smiling to a stranger or reading John
Grisham’s book. One of the most exciting things I have seen is green ketchup!What do I like?You can call me a serial
hobbyist. There are so many interesting and creative things you can do in this
world. I love music. I have been playing piano for 23 years and I am thrilled by the amount of fun and creativity you can have with it! You can be creative with pretty much anything you do. Writing a book is a
creative process. Creativity is beautiful because it moves people; it makes
their life empowered, interesting, and optimistic. 
That’s the reason why I do
creative projects and why there is such passion for entrepreneurship. Through
this type of work I have met many extraordinary, smart, and inspirational, yet
mysterious individuals. And I am still blown away.
I like spending time with
interesting people who love to share their experiences and ideas. You are
probably one of those individuals. I love to travel. I love parties, EDM
festivals, movie nights, Internet, wing suit jumping, and many other things.
There are million things I want to do, try, and practice. Though, I am always
lacking one thing: time. There is just not enough time in the week to do
everything I like. There is even not enough time in a month, or a year. But, I
am trying.
I also love cars and as
well as entrepreneurship. These 2 passions actually inspired me to write an eBook
which will help people save money when buying a car. On one hand, I am a tough
and skilled negotiator. On the other, I used to work as a salesman so I used
that knowledge when I was buying my car to counter dealership’s standard tips
and tricks they pull on people. The final result was plain to see: magnificent,
keep-it-in-your pocket savings of over $5,000 which equal to 20% of the car
value. Now, there is an eBook about it and you can do the same. What I Need & What You Get
Are you thinking about writing a book? Are you debating if it is cheaper to produce an eBook? Whichever road you take (you may ask me for advice on what's the best for your project) you will encounter various expenses that have never crossed your mind.I am pretty sure most people
think: “You are publishing an eBook, that doesn’t cost anything!” Let me tell
you, that is not the case.
Even I was surprised by the
fact that there are so many costs associated with publishing an eBook. The
publishing costs for this eBook will be between $1,200 and $1,400. Here is the itemized
breakdown of costs:

Professional
     cover design (very expensive)
Editing
     (reasonably expensive)
Professional
     formatting (quite expensive)
Legal
     consultations (quite expensive)
Tax
     consultations (quite expensive)
Music
     licensing (very expensive)
Video
     production (very expensive)
Indiegogo
     fee
Payment
     processing
Taxes
The goal of
the Indiegogo campaign is to raise $1,800. It’s not a lot considering the high
costs, but it would be inspiring to see that number go way above the goal. 
The money will be used to raise awareness of ""getting ripped-off"" problem and connect people with solutions to it. 
What's going to happen if campaign doesn't reach the funding goal? If I don’t
reach the funding goal, you will still get your copy of the eBook! Collected funds
will go to cover the existing costs of publishing a book, but I also might buy
myself a beer. Ok, let’s
talk about what you get! I have created a list of exciting perks that you can

The Impact
In this very
moment, there are more people on Facebook than there were on planet Earth 150
years ago. Sharing information is one the most important aspects of our daily lives.
We see each other. We hear each other. We share what we love and it reminds us
what we all have in common. This sharing is changing the way the world works
and improves our lives in many different ways. This flow of information is
creating a better life and new opportunities for all of us.
You have just found out about this project. If you keep
this information for yourself, you disrupt the flow. Nobody else can benefit
from it. If you share it, the flow continues. It leaves you in a happy and
empowered state. It creates a difference in someone else’s life.I am very passionate about this project. I have been working on it for some 700 hours over the past 5
months. That's on average 4 and a half hours every day. I have been living it, I have been breathing it, and now when it is
published, there is even more work to do. If you want to write a book, let me warn you: this is not for quitters.This is the
biggest project of my life because it influences everyone! We all buy cars. One of the most
intriguing aspects of any creative project is the impact it will have on this
world. In the beginning, you tend to see the project as a personal achievement and
something that is important to you. As you develop it and learn new things, the
vision changes and becomes greater on many different levels than you originally
thought of. Finally, very soon you realize the project is so much bigger than
you because of the positive impact it will have on other people’s lives and
their friends and families. We can never benefit from withholding information from others.
That’s the
reason why video for the book started with an inspiring quote:
“You are not
here merely to make a living. You are here to enable the world to live more amply,
with greater vision and with a finer spirit of hope and achievement.”

<p>I moved to Williston, North Dakota,
the heart of America’s current oil boom, in May of 2013 and spent the better
part of a year working in the oil field as a swamper for a rig moving company.</p>
<p>I hired on to one of the hardest
jobs on the planet, met and befriended men from all over the country
desperately trying to build better lives for themselves in an unforgiving
tundra, in a small town with an economy like capitalism on steroids.</p>
<p>I wrote over 500 pages while I was
there. I recorded over 9 hours of interviews with 7 different people. </p>
<p>From weeks spent sleeping in a truck
to months spent crashing on a mattress on the floor of a room shared with five
other men looking for work, from gun deals in garages to the hookers in the bars, from ex-cons on
work sites to the tough locals trying to make good in a home they barely recognize, I lived and worked with them for ten hard months. Now I want to share their stories and mine. Because I also experienced the quieter moments: true beauty in an unforgiving landscape, the sun dogs, that calm feeling ice fishing can give you and the wealth of kindness shown to me as an out-of-towner.   </p>
<p><b>What the Money Goes Toward</b></p>
<p>I am traveling back to North Dakota
with a professional photographer and documentarian to obtain the rest of the interviews I need for the book. Once I have the interviews, they will be
transcribed by a professional transcription service which is costly. The
integrity of the book hinges on the integrity of these transcriptions. It is
not something that I can do myself or ask friends to do for me. The research
also has expenses attached to it. Accessing court documents and public records
requires a lot of man hours as well as various fees. I am going to hire a
copy editor and a content editor when the work is drafted to make certain that
the proposal I write is as airtight of a presentation as possible. Also,
capitalizing on this campaign will buy me a small window of time in which I can
seclude myself and focus exclusively on the work.</p><p></p><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p><p>I want to tell this story. Telling this story in small gatherings and groups and answering questions about what life is like in a boom town, who I met, what I saw and what I think it all means, is an integral part of my process of writing this book.  If you have the ability to host a small gathering, preferably people who don't already know me well, who would consider donating and who would be interested in discussing the book with me, I am very open to that. </p><p>I'd also appreciate any help spreading the word about this campaign on the internet or through phone calls and conversations. </p>
<p><b>Why
I Am Writing This Book</b></p>
<p>I think this is one of the most
important stories in America right now.  While a great deal has been
written and debated (often inaccurately) about the environmental or

very little that has taken into account the lives of people who do the day to
day jobs that keep oil flowing in America. I want to tell the stories of these
lives. </p>
<p>I believe that the boom town is, in
fact, a microcosm for an economic model that is becoming more and more
prevalent in our time. It is completely unsustainable, it is scary and it also holds
beautiful, hopeful promise for thousands of people.</p>
<p>By writing about the modern oil
boom, I hope to write an expansive human portrait of workers that also
addresses some of our country's bigger, more thorny issues.  </p>
<p><b>Why

<p>The oil boom in
North Dakota has received coverage from the New York Times, the LA Times, NPR,
National Geographic and Men's Journal to name a few. While many of these
articles have been informative and well written, very little has been written
that goes below the surface of the boom or delves deeply and honestly into the
day to day lives of the people experiencing it.</p>
<p>I am not writing about the boom as a
New Yorker who flew to North Dakota for a week, noticed the roads were bad and
flew home. I'm writing about the boom as a 38 year old unskilled laborer who
uprooted himself in the hope of building a better life for himself in the oil
field. I came away with a completely eye opening experience that has fundamentally changed the way I view the economy, oil production and what it means to work hard.</p>
<p>I am no stranger to in-depth research, interviews or long term writing projects. I spent years working on my play Woody Guthrie
Dreams. That project involved digging through thousands of Woody’s unpublished
pages at the Guthrie Archive as well as interviewing and speaking to many of Guthrie's family members and friends such as Pete Seeger, Nora Guthrie and Ramblin’ Jack
Elliott.  I consider that play in many ways to be a precursor to this
current project which I believe can have an even greater, more immediate
impact.</p>

I took my first writing workshop with Hurston/Wright with brilliant writer-teachers: Tyehimba Jess, Patrice Gaines, and A. Van Jordan. So, I'm asking 30 of my family, friends, and colleagues to donate a minimum of $30 to this worthy institution that's been around for 24 years. What We Need & What You GetMy goal is to raise a minimum of $900 (30 people donating $30 each.) Of course, We are grateful for every contribution whether its a $30, $50 or $100 donation. The proceeds from this campaign will provide general operating funds to help Hurston/Wright pay non-program related expenses such as:
The salary for our part-time virtual assistant.
Paying our rent, telephone bills, web host service, Submittable account, etc. 
The cost to rent facilities to run our summer workshops for teenagers and adults in Washington, D.C.

Q. After the cost of the Book or any of the other versions, is it expensive? A. No. Most people are surprised at how much money is wasted on food because of habit or they think they have to go to the gym to stay in shape.
Q. When will I see results? A. Once the simple truth is understood, a life can change… This is a lifetime commitment.  How many times have you truly wanted something and went for it? Making a commitment to yourself and staying with it guaranties a productive life.
Q. Where did this idea come from? A. The author was raised by the system that is in this Bookl. His father - The Great Montyne, and beautiful mother China lived a life of temperance, self-control, and excitement, while enjoying the parts of life that destroy most people.
Q. What is the most important message in the program? A. No one is perfect; in times of fun and over doing it, it is important that we counteract our actions – “How?” you may ask. That is why we need to make this program available….",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

When I’m not writing, I love to read, listen to music, watch Authortube videos, attend NKOTB concerts with my friends, spend time with my family, and volunteer for Aniridia Foundation International (AFI) as the editor of the AFI's news edition, the Eye On Aniridia. </p><p>For book updates and insider info, follow me online:</p><p>View my website or to subscribe to my newsletter click:  <strong><a href=""http://www.jjotis.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here</a></strong></p><p>Follow me on Instagram <strong><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/jjotisauthor/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here</a></strong></p><h2><strong>Why I’m Pre-Selling My Book This Way</strong></h2><p>After querying with no luck, the traditional publishing industry slowing down even more due to COVID, and publishers not acquiring as many YA (young adult) novels, I've decided to self-publish my novel.

<li>Pay for a developmental editor and a copy editor (Cost: $1,700)</li>
<li>Pay for LLC logo, ebook cover &amp; paperback cover, book art, and character art that will go on all my book merchandise (Estimated Cost: $437)</li>
<li>Due to my low vision, I may need to hire someone to format my ebook and paperback book. (Estimated Cost: $350)</li>
<li>Purchase supplies to make unique crystal bookmarks for you. The bookmarks will have the crystals that are part of the magic system in my novel. (Estimated Cost: $120)</li>
<li>Pay for the printing of all paperback books, book merchandise, and to pay for shipping to get these perks to you.</li>

<p><strong>Humanos </strong>es una novela de ciencia ficción que aborda el inminente fin de la especie humana y, a la par, la esperanza de su continuidad a través de un importante descubrimiento.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">El hallazgo de un enorme objeto enterrado bajo un pequeño pueblo de la sierra de Madrid, desencadena una serie de sucesos que cambiarán la historia de la humanidad. Pocos años después del descubrimiento, la ciencia y la tecnología dan un enorme salto cualitativo y eso propicia el enfrentamiento entre los que, hasta ahora, controlaban los sectores productivos básicos y los que habían apostado por la nueva ciencia y la nueva manera de entender la vida.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Como ha venido ocurriendo durante casi todo el siglo anterior, existen dos claras tendencias políticas que, con este nuevo escenario se radicalizarán aún más. Eso lleva a graves enfrentamientos y, después, a su separación. Una nueva idea cala hondo en el hombre. Todo lo que vemos es Dios, lo que no vemos también es Dios, los animales y las plantas, la Tierra y los infinitos astros que pueblan el Universo. Nosotros somos Dios….</p>

En esa época, conocía a Maribel, con quien me casaría varios años después y con quien tendría a mis dos hijos. En esa época fue cuando comencé a interesarme por temas relacionados con el arte, teatro, poesía, música. En estas y en otras facetas artísticas, participé en mayor o menor medida.

He found relief during his struggle and his treatment from the use of medicinal marijuana. This is his story, about the neglect from doctors, his legal battles, and how he survived it all.<br/> <br/>I'm hoping this book will help someone like Adam. His case received no media coverage, no one knew a man days after his final chemotherapy treatment was arrested for growing marijuana, the only thing that gave him any relief during his treatment and help pause the continued growth of his cancer. He was arrested for a drug, legal to someone with his health condition that no doctor was willing to support.<br/> <br/>Merkel Cell Carcinoma is an extremely rare and aggressive form of skin cancer. Due to Adam's doctors being uneducated and unaware of Merkel Cell Carcinoma, his condition was neglected and very quickly escalated to Stage 4.<br/> <br/>In September 2010, when Adam was diagnosed. He was given a prognosis of 3 months to live, to the point where they highly suggested he start planning for his death during every oncology appointment. He did not die, he did not stop fighting and he is still alive today continuing his struggle. When diagnosed their major concern was that one of the largest tumors was constricting a major artery in his leg risking a pulmonary embolism at any moment.<br/> <br/><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong><br/><br/>This book is going to be self-published. I figured that was the best way to get the word out about his case. For anyone that would be interested in hearing about it, available to anyone who would benefit from it. My goal is to have this book published in paperback and e-book format. I'm not writing this book with the hope  to make an abundance of money, however self-publishing has it's own fees tied to it.<br/> <br/>I'm grateful and thankful for my friends. A lot of people have willingly donated their time and effort into editing and illustration for me so it's a cost I don't have to worry about.<br/> <br/>However, some money is needed to help make this book the best it can be. I'm looking for a bare minimum of $500. This contribution will help cover manuscripts for editing, minimal fees associated with self publishing, and the cost of buying a hard copies of the book once it's completed.<br/> <br/>If I exceed my $500, I will be giving back to the people who contributed their time to help make this book possible and put forth some money into advertising.<br/> <br/>If we reach $30,000, (after books costs and fees) we are able to re-pay loans associated with his legal battle.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Through everything, Adam maintained a positive attitude. He stayed positive when he had no other references, or anyone else to turn to. I want this book to be something someone like him can turn to. I want it to create an awareness of his experiences.

<h1>The Guild Literary Complex, Third World Press, and The American Writers Museum present the first annual BROOKSDAY!</h1>
<p>BROOKSDAY is a marathon reading of the works of Gwendolyn Brooks on her Birthday. </p>
<p>Help us honor the generosity and artistic legacy of one of Chicago’s most beloved literary figures. Teens, children, actors, and teachers join notable literary, cultural, civic, and political leaders from Chicago and beyond on stage at the Chicago Cultural Center on June 7 in celebration of the Pulitzer Prize winning Gwendolyn Brooks. </p>
<p>BROOKSDAY 2013 will be the first step toward creating an annual event that will grow into a city-wide festival by 2017, Brooks's 100th birthday. We are creating an event that will commemorate Gwendolyn Brooks's artistic achievement, her legendary generosity toward other poets, her influence as a pathbreaking cultural figure in Chicago and the nation, and her deserved stature as the iconic poet of modern Chicago!</p>
<p>Gwendolyn Brooks was the first African American poet to hold the position of Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress (the same position that is now called Poet Laureate). Her many books include <em>A Street In Bronzeville</em> (1945),<em> Annie Allen</em> (for which she won the Pulitzer Prize in 1949), <em>In the Mecca</em> (1968), <em>Blacks</em> (1987) and a novel, <em>Maud Martha </em>(1953). She was the Poet Laureate of Illinois from 1968 until her death in 2000. We hope to create not only an event but also a consciousness in Chicago and the nation of a poet of extraordinary talent and an exceptional person as well, a woman of immense accomplishment both professional and personal. With your generous support we will gather at the Chicago Cultural Center on June 7 2013 to celebrate all that is Gwendolyn Brooks.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Wassim (that's Weh-seem) and I'm an independent writer from Peoria, Illinois. I am getting ready to self-publish my second collection of short stories, <em>Mouth of God, Light of Infinity,</em> in April. The stories in the book deal with life and mortality, in addition to other themes. It is nearing completion, with a tentative release date of April 16th, 2013.<em><br/></em></p>
<p>I put out my first collection, <em>I Know What I Know Now, </em>in early 2011 and did relatively well given the very limited budget I had to work with. I am trying to put out the highest quality book I can while reaching a larger audience. </p>
<p>I'm turning to Indiegogo because, as a graduate student paying for school, money is very tight for me. I believe the partnership with Indiegogo and its users will help my team and I release the best book we can.</p>
<p>The book will be available physically and in ebook form (PDF, MOBI and EPUB), with plans to release it through Amazon and Apple's digital bookstores. I will also be reaching out to local bookstores and businesses. </p>
<p>I'll be making updates as needed to fill you folks in on the progress of the book, any potential delays, etc.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I have edited several anthologies of Native writers such as Genocide of the Mind and Eating Fire, Tasting Blood: Breaking the Great Silence of the American Indian Holocaust. I am going to publish this new anthology through my little independent press rENEGADE pLANETS pUBLISHING.</p>

Exploring Quantum physics in relation to Indigenous peoples' understanding of the spiritual universe, these essays and poems include personal experiences, traditional stories, fictional and nonfiction ponderings, beliefs, and explorations.</p>

<p>I plan to market this book to various schools and universities so that it can be used to bring truth and honor to the Indigenous peoples of this land.</p>

<div><span>I am a ICU RN and Patient Advocate. The information that is being provided is regarding my position when I worked as a critical care RN in Florida. I left that position due to watching patients being neglected and abused. I left with a dozen letters of recommendation and was a great employee. </span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>While I was a staff nurse and periodically charge nurse, I witnessed unnecessary deaths that were covered up by Administration. I was told to keep quiet about the situations if I wanted to keep my job. I was told to falsify documentation about how often I was in a patient's room. My nurse manager actually sat my down in front of a computer when I didn't chart that I had been in a room with a patient every 15 minutes the previous day. She then told me to erase the previous day charting and chart it as she told me too. That patient was restrained and on a ventilator. I had been caring for another patient that had been vomiting blood for eight hours and was trying to save his life. When I finally got a moment to ask for help, she only told me that my charting better reflect that I had been in there every 15 minutes. I had begged for help and she told me to falsify documentation and walked away without offering any assistance.</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>The patient's mother overheard the nurse manager tell me to falsify documentation. This woman stated she would testify to that. Turns out she is a profiler for the FBI. That patient and I kept in touch with each other. He has since written a book about his experience. His book is titled, One In Forty Million by Jerry Johnson. He is a television producer and we are trying to find a way to make this message public. </span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div>
<span>I kept in touch with several of the families. I took photos of the neglect and abuse. I </span><span>contacted families regarding how their loved ones really died. I informed them of the neglect and abuse their loved ones suffered.</span><span> I have contracts with the families to share the photos and their stories. I have ran the information and contracts by legal council. I am informed that I may release the information to the public. The families have urged me to make their stories public. </span>
</div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>I have certified e mails that I sent administration and information proving proving my nurse manager had told me nothing would change after I sent her the certified e mail stating that we had watched patients suffer and die due to understaffing. I spent over a year gathering evidence of the abuse, neglect, and Medicare fraud. I have patient's charts, billing records, photos, and other documentation proving the abuse and neglect of what you will see in the video. Families gave me the records and signed legal contracts stating that I may disclose any information needed. The families have encouraged me to make these and other stories public. </span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>I had worked with an expert that is a medical fraud instructor contracted with the FBI. We have proven Medicare fraud. She told me that I am the Erin Brokovich of the medical field. </span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>I knew that patients needed to be protected and educated from this type of treatment. I wrote and published Patient Empowerment Guide and Journal (self published) to help guide patients through the hospital process and make health care professionals accountable. It explains everything a patient may encounter in the hospital from lab tests, scans, procedures, oxygenation, mechanical ventilation, blood products, therapies, nutrition, medication schedules, and about 750 medical terms that we use to speak over patient's level of understanding. I also provide a simple check mark and fill in the blank system to record all care provided or not provided. There is also a cancer journal and obstetrics journal. It is written in layman's terms at a middle school level. I also tell you to obtain you medical records as documentation is often falsified. Nurses are required to chart that they provide care of specific care at specific times, even if not performed. This cannot be done when you have several patients to care for.</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>I am currently writing my second book, Swept Under the Rug...Horror Stories from the Other Side of the Bed. The stories are true accounts of the neglect, abuse, and medical fraud I witnessed as an ICU nurse. Some of these patients are in the video. There are many other stories that are not in the video.</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>I am trying to get this story heard to protect patients. I have over 100 photos that reflect the real conditions of patients left in the ICU that have no loved one to stay in the room. The elderly are often neglected as they are often too afraid to say anything or are unable to speak out. I am willing to share the photos. I am trying to get this message out to protect the public. I've asked nurses all over the country and they all state the same conditions. I'm doing what I know to do to stop the needless suffering. I've traveled to CNN in Atlanta, Washington D.C., and contacted Congressman Braley. Congressman Braley once mentioned he wanted me to hold a Congressional hearing and bring patient safety awareness to the nation. That has not happened as of the present time. I spoke with a reporter from the New York Times and they said they had already done a story on this subject but would keep the information in mind. Now I am reaching out to the public in hopes to put an end to this abuse and neglect..and even fraud.</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>The first two photos in the video are of a woman neglected for weeks- she did not have Necrotizing faciitis. She was just neglected. You can see one the lower leg where the catheter ate into her flesh. I have her medical records to prove it. The third through seventh is of a woman that could not speak due no one cleaning her mouth for days- although they charted that they did provide oral care every two hours as required for days. She was not my patient but I cared for her anyway. When I cleaned her mouth which took 30 minutes she then grabbed my arm and said,""Thank you for caring about me."" </span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>Other stories include a woman that came in with Pneumonia. She was lovely and had a great sense of humor. Due to Physical Therapy not ambulating this patient, she developed pressure ulcers on her buttocks and left heel. They took this woman's leg off in pieces. First her foot, then up to knee, and finally up to the hip. She died two days after the final amputation..on her birthday. This woman begged me not to let them take her leg. If she had received proper care, she would probably be alive today. </span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>There is a story of woman that had been dead for over nine minutes but her oxygen saturation was reading 100% due to faulty equipment. We performed a code blue only to realize that after reviewing information and realizing the alarm was not functioning.</span></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>Another family gave me about 100 photos of the abuse their wife and mother experienced. They also provided me with a daily journal of the neglect and suffering. She had numerous decubitis ulcers from laying in her own waste. Since I was there and knew the family and the conditions of understaffing, I know their stories they want me to share with you are true.</span></div>

<p>The one who possesses the Eye can do anything. Entire Empires were born from its influence only to fall at its loss.

<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>
<p>I have slaved away as a non-fiction ghost writer for the past ten years while working on fiction on the side. After a recent shift to fiction developmental editing, I've finally gotten the time I need to seriously pursue my first love: Science Fiction and Fantasy writing.</p>
<p>For samples of my writing, please check out the links above. <em>Zero</em> (linked below) is my brand-new web serial, and it is an experiment and challenge to myself. I wanted to see what I could do if I <em>had</em> to post a new scene once a week!</p>
<p><a href=""http://rjblain.com/zero-a-science-fiction-web-serial/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Zero - A Web Serial""><strong>Zero: A Science Fiction Web Serial</strong></a></p></div>","Raised as a combat slave from birth, all Terin desires from the Arena is his death. His life, however, is worth more than he ever imagined possible.
With the Erelith Empire in control of both the Hand and the Heart of God, there exists but one force able to free the continent from the iron grip of the Emperor: The Eye of God.
The one who possesses the Eye can do anything. Entire Empires were born from its influence only to fall at its loss. But with great power comes a greater price, and unless Terin can find a way to prevent the relics from being reunited, he'll lose more than his life -- his soul will be destroyed.
You can find samples of my writing at the bottom. Don't drink anything while reading The Nightmare on Kiln Street. I've been informed that this short story should be classified as a weapon.
Everything started as a ‘What if…?’ question: What if ancient Rome, the Catholic Church, elements of Victorian Society, and a magical world got together for one wild night and had a child?
The Eye of God is that child.

<p>All perk levels will have a copy of my upcoming novel, <em>The City of Clocks</em>, added. This novel is expected to release in first or second quarter of 2014. Date TBD.</p>
<p>About <em>The City of Clocks:</em></p>
<p>When the Great Clock didn't ring in the new year, Aerrik knew something was wrong -- very wrong. Everything goes wrong all at once. He's separated from Mya, a fellow escapee from the Duke's usurpation of the Arasoran throne. His clock is broken, and without it, he faces the purge. Someone wants him dead or alive.<br/><br/>Worse still, his past comes back to haunt him. Without Aerrik, however, Arasanor is doomed to fall. But, will the kingdom be thrust into chaos from the Duke's reign, or will the very land itself turn on the struggling island and kill them all? </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The City of Clocks is a fantasy novel.</span></p>
<em><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Note: $30+ perks will also receive a paperback version of the City of Clocks in addition to the digital copy, should this campaign reach the $1,750 stretch goal.</span></em>
<p><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""> </span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Storm Without End</span></h3>
<p>Kalen’s throne is his saddle, his crown is the dirt on his brow, and his right to rule is sealed in the blood that stains his hand. Few know the truth about the one-armed Rift King, and he prefers it that way. When people get too close to him, they either betray him or die. The Rift he rules cares nothing for the weak. More often than not, even the strong fail to survive.</p>
<p>His abduction could easily destroy his home, his people, and start a hopeless and bloody war. There are many who desire his death, and few who hope for his survival. With peace in the Six Kingdoms quickly crumbling, it falls to him to try to stop the conflict that is swiftly taking the entire continent by storm.</p>
<p>But something even more terrifying than the machinations of men has returned to the lands:  The skreed. They haven’t been seen for a thousand years, and even the true power of the Rift King might not be enough to save his people — and the world — from destruction.</p>
<h3>The dream of writing an epic...</h3>
<p>Epic fantasy has always been the first love of my life. As a woman writing science fiction and fantasy, it isn't easy having a dream of writing a series in a world dominated by male authors. I've had bites on this story from agents and houses on this novel, but one thing has served as a deterrent:</p>
<p>I'm a woman writing in a male-dominated genre, and that makes me a hard sell.</p>
<p>I'm not the type to quit over something like that, so I'm making my stand. By the end of 2013, I want to release <em>Storm Without End</em> in print and as an e-book. I've already acquired the cover art for the novel.</p>
<p>I don't like talking about myself that much -- I like to think of myself as boring, although a little eccentric. Who wouldn't be, writing up tales of imaginary places and people for a living?</p>
<p>When I'm not making forays into fantasy worlds, I work as a developmental editor for fantasy and science fiction novelists.</p>
<p>I'm 30, and I'm proud to say that I'm right where I want to be in my life. I have a husband and four cats, and I get to pursue my love of reading and writing.</p>
<p>Here's my official biography for the curious:</p>
<p>RJ Blain suffers from a Moleskine journal obsession, a pen fixation, and a terrible tendency to pun without warning.</p>
<p>When she isn’t playing pretend, she likes to think she’s a cartographer and a sumi-e painter. In reality, she herds cats and a husband, and obeys the commands of Tsu Dhi, the great warrior fish.</p>
<p>In her spare time, she daydreams about being a spy. Should that fail, her contingency plan involves tying her best of enemies to spinning wheels and quoting James Bond villains until she is satisfied.</p>
<p>My first book, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E5R8Y2A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""The Eye of God - RJ Blain""><em>The Eye of God</em></a>, debuted in late July! Learn more about this book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E5R8Y2A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Eye of God"">here</a>. With the fantastic help of the indiegogo community, one dream has already come true.</p>
<p>Now, I'm here again, asking for help to make another dream come true: Publishing my epic fantasy series, Requiem for the Rift King. </p>

<h3>The Nitty-Gritty</h3>
<p>Publishing a book isn't easy. There is a lot that goes into making a novel happen. I acquired a piece of the puzzle already: The Cover Art.</p>
<p>My cover artist, <a href=""http://saltwaterwitch.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Saltwater Witch - Art by Chris Howard"">Chris Howard</a>, has created this beautiful cover for the novel:</p>
<p><img alt=""Storm Without End Cover Art"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://penandpage.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/RJ-Blain-Storm-without-End-Cover-Art-with-Titles-194x300.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Storm Without End Cover Art - Chris Howard""/></p>
<p>Now, I need to get the funds to make the rest of it happen.</p>
<p>Here is a basic breakdown of what's needed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developmental, Copy, and Proofing Editorial (~$400)</li>
<li>Print &amp; E-book Formatting ($300 - by Lisa Cohen)</li>
<li>Prints (Photo &amp; Large sized) - (~$70)</li>
<li>Copyright Registration Fee - ($65)</li>
<li>Unexpected expenses - (~$65)</li>
<li>Shipping - (~100)</li>
</ul>
<p>My shipping expenses are calculated at $7 per signed novel. It's a little less per unsigned novel. This should include the box and the shipping fee for the box. (Getting the estimate was a little difficult, but this is the closest I've come up with.) This is regular, slow mail in a standard box.</p>
<p>The copyright registration fee is for CA registration (where I live.)</p>
<p>I already have ISBNs for the books, as well as cover art, so these fees were not included.</p>
<p>If I make more than the base amount for the novel, the excess funds will go to paying for future book costs, including cover art, future registration fees, and so on.</p>
<h3>What do you get?</h3>
<p>This is the best part -- the perks!</p>
<p>Please note: Shipping address will be required on all perk levels. If the campaign does well, all perk levels will receive an envelope from me with some goodies in it, including leftover <em>The Eye of God</em> promo materials.</p>

<p><span>$100 - signed, print copy of Storm Without End and The Eye of God, 9x12 prints of both covers, photo-sized print of both covers, a bookmark from The Eye of God, e-book copies of both books, and a custom, hand drawn and inked map of the Storm Without End main continent.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Due to the amount of time it takes to complete a map, the maps will ship by December 15. The other goodies (including books) will be shipped when they're ready, which should be no later than November 15.</span></p>
<p><span>The ship date for <em>The City of Clocks</em>, should the campaign reach its stretch goal, will be the date of its release, which is TBD.</span></p>
<p><span>The map will be a completed recreation of this. (This is an older version of the original map.)</span></p>

<p><span><strong>If you live outside of the US or Canada, </strong>there will be an addition charge for shipping -- contact me if you live abroad for an estimate on the real shipping costs. (The shipping fee will be the difference between the costs to ship to a US/CA address and your location. All you need to do is add the difference to your contribution and I'll handle the rest.)<br/></span></p>

The ship date for The City of Clocks, should the campaign reach its stretch goal, will be the date of its release, which is TBD.
The map will be a completed recreation of this. (This is an older version of the original map.)

If you live outside of the US or Canada, there will be an addition charge for shipping -- contact me if you live abroad for an estimate on the real shipping costs. (The shipping fee will be the difference between the costs to ship to a US/CA address and your location. All you need to do is add the difference to your contribution and I'll handle the rest.)



Other Ways You Can Help
If you want to help with this campaign, the easiest way is to tell your friends. Spreading the word helps people know this book is coming.
That's half the battle.
Thank you so very much for your support.
The Horrors of the Video...
My editor made me do it. Seriously, if I were good with video, I'd probably be an actress instead of a novelist. It's a miracle I figured out how to make the video happen at all.

<h3>Does the world really need another song book? Yes!!!</h3>
<p><strong>Children in Waldorf schools around the world begin every day with singing.</strong> They sing throughout the day in main lesson, foreign language lessons, chorus, and just about every other time during the day. Every day is a symphony of song in a Waldorf school.</p>
<p><strong>The Waldorf schools have a music curriculum wonderfully designed around the child's developing consciousness.</strong> It starts in first grade with pentatonic music. In the course of the next eight years, a student will sing farming songs, clapping songs, folk songs, number songs, graces, work songs, echo songs, call and response songs, rounds, songs with ostinato, harmony singing, songs in Latin and other languages, ballads, catches, sea shanties, madrigals, 3- and 4-part songs, and fugal canons. Wow, that's a lot of songs!</p>
<p><strong>Until now, there hasn't been a book that brings the wealth and wonder of all these songs together.</strong> That's when I came up with the idea for <i>The Waldorf Book of Songs.</i> With over 300 songs for grades one to eight and arranged by grade, it'll be so easy to find that perfect song, whether you're a teacher, a parent, or a musician keen on tapping into this great collection for children of all ages. </p>
<p><strong>I've been working on <i>The Waldorf Book of Songs</i> for many years and now it’s time to ask for your help.</strong> The collection will be easy to navigate, with songs arranged by grade, and additional chapters for festivals, seasons, graces, and celebrations. They’ve all been chosen with the Waldorf curriculum in mind. You’ll recognize many of them as ""Waldorf classics"" right away. There really is a song for every age and every occasion.</p>
<p><strong><i>The Waldorf Book of Songs</i> will have over 300 songs, making it the largest and most complete Waldorf songbook ever published.</strong> It will be a treasure for any Waldorf teacher, parent or student, and it's my dream that it will find wide use and enjoyment outside the Waldorf schools as well. Everyone I tell about it seems to want a copy. </p>
<p><strong>Please help make my dream come true. </strong></p>

<h3>Three points to consider from conversations with teachers:</h3>
<h3>1. Comprehensive selection of songs for all ages</h3>
<p><strong>Over the past few years I've talked with a lot of teachers and musicians.</strong> Many of them said they wanted a Waldorf song book that was comprehensive and covered all the grades from first to eighth. They also wanted more than just a song book. They longed for a book that delved into the pedagogy behind the songs, addressing questions like, ""Why introduce round singing in fourth grade?"" and ""Why is it important to start singing simple minor tunes in third grade?""</p>
<h3>2. Crowdsourced content – you can suggest songs</h3>
<p><strong>There's such a wealth of knowledge among teachers everywhere. I thought, ""Why not open it up to everyone to contribute?""</strong> </p>
<p>Every time I met with a class teacher or a music teacher, I came away with a musical gem. They all had cherished songs that they had gathered over the years. Whether it was a special arrangement of a standard folk song, a Greek song for 5th grade that she discovered on a trip to the Greek Isles, an 8th grade graduation song, or a farming song for 3rd grade, they were all incredible additions. </p>
<p>Anyone from anywhere in the world will be able to send in their best songs for consideration. We'll have an online crowdsourcing portal open starting in September. There's gold out there, let's bring it together!</p>
<h3>3. Audio files – anytime, anywhere</h3>
<p><strong>Instead of including CDs with the book, we decided to host all the audio files for <i>The Waldorf Book of Songs</i> online.</strong> CDs are fast becoming obsolete. You will be able to hear what the songs sound like. Stream them on our website. You can listen to them anytime, anywhere.</p>

<h3>What would a typical chapter look like?</h3>
<p><strong>Take a look at the current song list for third grade and you'll see over 35 songs chosen for their natural musicality and suitability for the nine-year-old.</strong> The third-grader moves away from mood of the fifth and pentatonic songs to songs which are well-grounded and based on a diatonic scale.</p>
<p>Songs based on a diatonic scale are introduced for the first time in the third grade and help the child find firm ground with melodies that begin and end on a tonic. Simple tunes in a minor key can now be introduced and farming, craft, work and number songs lend a new feeling to music in the classroom.</p>

</div></div>","The story of Coding Palz - Top 20 Amazon Bestseller in Children' Programming.
There are kids story books on science & math , reading & biology , even astronomy. Ever wondered why there aren't coding books for kids? We wondered too - that's why we decided to create a series of story books that teach kids coding. 
We are not talking middle school , high school kids. Coding Palz story books are for Preschoolers , Kindergartners through second graders. No kidding!


We have taken a lot of care in our coding books. Even the characters are named after programming concepts.
Json,Jazz & Ruby the robot are pals who live in Codezilla town. They solve challenges using their coding skills.Their interactions are written in a way that forms the basis of programming. Coding meets Story telling.


Our Plan

We want to create 20 story books with a total of 200 colorful, fun filled , educational pages. Each story book will cover a specific coding concept. We will cover topics like

Loops
IF condition
IF-Then-ELSE condition
Font
CSS
Database
Query
Events
Any Many More!

Why do we need your support
Given the audience we are targeting , illustration is very important.Your contribution will help us pay for Illustration. And of course you will get our lovely books.



Day to day adventures of the Coding Palz
Find how Json & Jazz code Ruby the robot for her dance competition.What code could have caused Ruby to swirl like a tornado!




Checkout how Mr.SHA the spray painting password lock secures Json's treasure box.



Our dream is to kid-i-fy coding. Coding is going to be literacy for the future generation. We want to provide affordable coding education to all kids. Your contribution will help us realize this dream.
Sometimes the coding experiment results in silly outcomes. Oops! Why is Json covered in a mountain of cookie packets. Could it be a rogue loop statement.

   
The Coding pals never give up. They are curious, they are fun to hangout with. Things may go wrong , but they always find a solution.
A porcupine with marshmallows? Now , that's a sweet solution.



What credibility do we have?
We have the first four stories on Amazon.

http://www.amazon.com/Coding-Kids-computer-Childrens-programming-ebook/dp/B00RAGLUH4
We have received rave reviews. We also rank within top 20 in 
Children Programming books category. We need your help to get the remaining 16 
books out in the market.



Our Accolades
Our Volume 1 book bundle with 4 books was Number 1 in Children' Programming books genre a month after release when we ran a free promotion.


4 months later, the paid ranking is consistently within top 30 in Children' programming genre.

 I run these campaigns to live so I can keep doing this. By contributing you will keep me alive and fed, and help make self-publication more successful.    What We Need & What You Get I need money, we all do.  A lot of self-published authors do so as a sideline, for me this is my livelihood.  Money lets me keep doing what I do.  The goal may sound like a lot, but after fees come out that leaves less than you would think to live on for about 3 months.  This time out, I will be providing many perks tied into my writing-advice blog, The Writer's Brain.  I will offer critiques of anything from stories up to full-length novels.
 This will be different than our other campaigns, because the entire book will be done by the time the campaign is finished.  The ebooks will go out in a few weeks, and the print version will follow after within a month or so.  There will be very little waiting.  Even if I don't make goal, every perk will be fulfilled.

I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network.

<h3 style=""text-align: right;"">La Novela</h3>
<p>Tres mujeres y otros tantos hombres se reúnen para celebrar la jubilación de una de ellas. Durante la sobremesa, esta hace una pregunta acerca de un suceso que transformó profundamente la relación entre el grupo e incluso cambió las existencias, truncándolas. Las demás personas se ven abocadas a un pasado de horror y angustia. Décadas más tarde de que ocurriera el hecho que marcó sus vidas, por primera vez se atreven a hablar de ello. Afloran sentimientos de culpa, temores no superados todavía, confesiones que se han mantenido férreamente silenciadas. El fantasma del pasado sobrevuela ominoso la escena, poniendo sal en la vieja herida. Un drama íntimo, duro, devastador, cargado de veracidad, narrado por seis personajes muy distintos entre sí, unidos por la amistad y el hilo del destino. Todo ello dentro de una atmósfera con cierta perspectiva feminista y denuncia social.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Who: I'm a third-year journalism student at Ball State University who specializes in feature writing.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What: I'm trying to raise money to participate in a university-approved program (""BSU at the Games"") that will allow myself, over 30 other journalism students and a few faculty members to cover the London 2012 Summer Olympics. We do not have event passes to the games, but we will be traveling to London to produce content surrounding the games (news and feature stories, info-graphics and interactives, video coverage, photo essays and more). I will be a part of the feature-writing team, and I will write articles and create multimedia stories about the Olympic athletes, their experiences, their families, the atmosphere of London and more. Prior to this three-week program, I will be studying abroad in Worcester, England for six weeks, making a total of nine weeks abroad.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Where: London and Worcester, England</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When: June 13 - July 27 (Worcester study abroad program)</p>
<p>July 27 - August 14 (BSU at the Games program)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>How: With your help! Unfortunately, traveling to one of the most popular travel destinations during the single most important international sporting event is quite costly. This is an experience I cannot duplicate, and my participation in this program would be a dream come true.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I haven't had much travel experience because of financial limitations. I did, however, have the opportunity to travel abroad to Ireland with an Honors class over spring break 2011. This new opportunity to travel to London and Worcester will shape my career-related experience (the opportunity to cover the Olympics supersedes any opportunities I would have to do a summer internship in the States) and my education (I'll be taking classes taught by British faculty in Worcester for six weeks).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I also hope to use my experience to encourage other students with financial constraints to find ways to travel abroad. Even spending just a week in Ireland broadened my world-view and positively altered my perceptions. I believe that everyone should try to take advantage of travel opportunities, so in addition to the content I create for BSU at the Games while in England, I will be writing a weekly blog for the Ball State student-run, award-winning newspaper, The Daily News (<a href=""http://www.bsudailynews.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bsudailynews.com</a>). I hope that by sharing my experiences through this blog, I will be able to show others that opportunities like this are within reach.</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>BSU at the Games summer program - 2,478.25 (includes airfare, lodging, program support)<br/></p>
<p>Worcester summer study abroad program - 6,132.00 (includes lodging and meals, cultural visits, program support)</p>
<p>Tuition - $1700</p>
<p>Total - 10,310.25</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have already paid $500-deposits for both programs with my savings, and I have applied for scholarships in attempt to cover as much of the costs as possible. However, I cannot reach this total goal without the support of patrons like yourself. Whatever I cannot raise through fundraising efforts and through scholarships and grants, I will have to try to pay out-of-pocket (through loans).</p>

<p>Spread the word! The more exposure my fundraising efforts get, the closer I will get to reaching my goal. Any other ideas for fundraising are welcome. Thank you for your time and contributions!</p>

I hope that by sharing my experiences through this blog, I will be able to show others that opportunities like this are within reach.


What I Need & What You Get
BSU at the Games summer program - 2,478.25 (includes airfare, lodging, program support)
Worcester summer study abroad program - 6,132.00 (includes lodging and meals, cultural visits, program support)
Tuition - $1700
Total - 10,310.25

I have already paid $500-deposits for both programs with my savings, and I have applied for scholarships in attempt to cover as much of the costs as possible. However, I cannot reach this total goal without the support of patrons like yourself. Whatever I cannot raise through fundraising efforts and through scholarships and grants, I will have to try to pay out-of-pocket (through loans).

What do you get for helping out with my cause? See the perks on the sidebar.


Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word! The more exposure my fundraising efforts get, the closer I will get to reaching my goal. Any other ideas for fundraising are welcome. Thank you for your time and contributions!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For the past 30 years my husband Dan and I have kept copious notes with correlative evidence of many of the causes of my seizures and compiled them into this book, ""Seizure Triggers."" </p>
<p>Do you or someone you know suffer with seizures? Did you know that 1 in 100 Americans will have a seizure at some point in their lifetime? And that the majority will likely never know the cause?  Neurotoxins, environmental toxins, food additives, dyes, potent smells; could these be seizure triggers? <strong>They are for me. </strong>In this book, I share my seizure triggers that my neurologists over the years have never even asked me or told me about. I share my personal discovered triggers as well as others that people have shared with us. I offer ideas and ways on how to avoid these triggers and decrease the possibility of actually having a seizure. Do these triggers affect each of us the same way? No. Could knowing about them possibly help avoid having a seizure? Yes.​</p>
<p>I have olfactory (smell) triggered seizures, which is a type of epilepsy called ""reflex epilepsy"". It is not common, but maybe because it is not well known. According to a recent study, olfactory function in epilepsy has not been thoroughly researched. People are having more seizures than ever before. Why? Because we live in a toxic world. Environmental toxins invade our living environments, our homes, our food, our everyday lives...yet, so many are unaware of what they can do to the brain. </p>
<p>Join us in the fight against epilepsy to uncover these previously overlooked seizure triggers.</p>
<p>We are sharing what we have discovered because people need to know.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3><strong>Story of my book</strong></h3><p>My name is Stein Broeder and I am the author of <i>The Business of Trust: How Trust Creates Business Value Through Employee and Customer Experience</i>. I wrote this book because I wanted to explore how trust really works in the business world. I set out to learn how organizations and business leaders can drive real business impact by optimizing their employee and customer experience to earn and build trust. I began writing this book with a pre-pandemic mindset, but as we have progressed through this pandemic I have come to realize now, more than ever, trust is what is going to separate those who realize success from both a leadership and business standpoint.</p><p>My hope is that by reading this book you will discover how trust really works and how employee and customer experiences are the best pathways to earning and building trust. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for driving business impact in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you start thinking about how to apply trust drivers to your business or organization.</p><p>In this book, you'll read about the characteristics of trust and why trust is so important in business. You will learn about:</p><ul>
<li>The speed of trust: When there is trust, things happen faster. Trust creates momentum and enables progress.</li>
<li>The economics of trust: When trust goes up, speed goes up and cost goes down.</li>
<li>The trust bottom line: Trust is the most valuable asset of any organization</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>You will love this book if you are interested in understanding why trust matters in the business world.</p><p><i>The Business of Trust </i>is a non-fiction book that speaks to business leaders who want to build an organization that is founded in trust. </p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>The book - The Business of Trust</strong></h3><p>The book is written in 5 parts...<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction and chapters 1-3. In this section, you will discover the reasons why I’ve embarked on this journey to learn more about trust and what exactly sparked my curiosity. You will find out why trust is fundamental to the success of any leader and business while also learning how to inspire client obsession in your team through relentless discovery, meaningful connection and earning trust.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 4-7. In this section, you will discover why trust is said to work wonders. Hint: speed. Learn how trust translates into economic terms so that you can quantify the impact building (or breaking) trust really has.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 8-10. In this section, you will learn the best way to build and earn the trust that is vital to the success of your business or organization. Trust is the currency and experiences are the transactions through which value is earned and built. Find out why customer experience is a superpower and the reasons why you need to invest in the employee experience. Hot take: employees are your most important customers.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains Chapters 11-13. What’s the best way to learn? From history. Explore how the most effective leaders have built trust and how companies today are painstakingly working to build trust moment by moment. Don’t forget that trust can be lost too! Fast. Trust is built in drops and lost in buckets.</p><p>Part 5 contains Chapters 14-17. This is when you will be introduced to the 3 trust-drivers that matter most and learn how you can apply them to your employee and customer experiences to start driving real business impact.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>What I need &amp; what you'll get</strong></h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p><ul>

<li>The copyediting for my book - to help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this winter.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish. </p><p>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:</p><ul>

I wrote this book because I wanted to explore how trust really works in the business world. I set out to learn how organizations and business leaders can drive real business impact by optimizing their employee and customer experience to earn and build trust. I began writing this book with a pre-pandemic mindset, but as we have progressed through this pandemic I have come to realize now, more than ever, trust is what is going to separate those who realize success from both a leadership and business standpoint.My hope is that by reading this book you will discover how trust really works and how employee and customer experiences are the best pathways to earning and building trust. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for driving business impact in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you start thinking about how to apply trust drivers to your business or organization.In this book, you'll read about the characteristics of trust and why trust is so important in business. You will learn about:
The speed of trust: When there is trust, things happen faster. Trust creates momentum and enables progress.
The economics of trust: When trust goes up, speed goes up and cost goes down.
The trust bottom line: Trust is the most valuable asset of any organization
 You will love this book if you are interested in understanding why trust matters in the business world.The Business of Trust is a non-fiction book that speaks to business leaders who want to build an organization that is founded in trust.  The book - The Business of TrustThe book is written in 5 parts...Part 1 contains the introduction and chapters 1-3. In this section, you will discover the reasons why I’ve embarked on this journey to learn more about trust and what exactly sparked my curiosity. You will find out why trust is fundamental to the success of any leader and business while also learning how to inspire client obsession in your team through relentless discovery, meaningful connection and earning trust.Part 2 contains Chapters 4-7. In this section, you will discover why trust is said to work wonders. Hint: speed. Learn how trust translates into economic terms so that you can quantify the impact building (or breaking) trust really has.Part 3 contains Chapters 8-10. In this section, you will learn the best way to build and earn the trust that is vital to the success of your business or organization. Trust is the currency and experiences are the transactions through which value is earned and built. Find out why customer experience is a superpower and the reasons why you need to invest in the employee experience. Hot take: employees are your most important customers.Part 4 contains Chapters 11-13. What’s the best way to learn? From history. Explore how the most effective leaders have built trust and how companies today are painstakingly working to build trust moment by moment. Don’t forget that trust can be lost too! Fast. Trust is built in drops and lost in buckets.Part 5 contains Chapters 14-17. This is when you will be introduced to the 3 trust-drivers that matter most and learn how you can apply them to your employee and customer experiences to start driving real business impact. What I need & what you'll getThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

(“Bonnice” is Lisa’s pen name and Swiney is pronounced “Sweeney”) have 
been a couple for 24 years. They met at Snickerz Comedy Bar, when both 
were touring standup comedians, working with such acts as Tim 
Allen, Jeff Foxworthy and Drew Carey. For a while, they combined forces 
as comedy team Sweeney &amp; Sweeney, and hosted a show called Sweeney 
and Sweeney’s Hollywood Revue, a variety show designed for radio.
 The show was taped at the Ice House in Pasadena, CA. Since then, 
they’ve settled into a more ordinary life, but they never lost their 
taste for humor, especially when combined with fun and quirky road 
trips.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/291107/files/20140104111258-jeff_and_lisa.jpg?1388862778"" src="""" style=""width: 529px; height: 529px;""/></p>Lisa is an MSNBC.com Excellence Award-winning writer. She 
appeared in 2013 on the ID network’s program <i>Catch My Killer</i>, in an 
interview about her best-selling book, <b><i><a href=""www.amazon.com/Fear-Our-Father-Murder-Family/dp/0425258734"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fear of Our Father</a></i></b>. Her radio 
show, <b><i><a href=""http://www.blogtalkradio.com/shapeshifting"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shape Shifting with Lisa Bonnice</a></i></b>, is based on her first book, 
<b><i><a href=""www.amazon.com/Shape-Shifting--reclaiming-YOUR-perfect-body/dp/0979999901"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shape Shifting—reclaiming your perfect body</a></i></b>, and airs on BlogTalkRadio. 
She is working on a follow-up to Shape Shifting, and will challenge 
herself to stay fit on the road, after losing 65 pounds.<br/><br/>Jeff, 
like Lisa, was a nationally touring stand-up comic in the 80s and 90s. 
He has dedicated his life to pursuing a Jimmy Buffet lifestyle (barefoot
 and on the beach, perhaps with a margarita in hand). Whether living on the beach in a tent, or in a nudist resort in Florida, he’s an avid 
life spectator with a wry sense of the absurd.<br/><br/>Lisa has been 
travel-blogging since 2010, when she and her friend Vicci went on a
 trip they called Epiphany Quest. Vicci had just divorced and needed to 
clear her head, so the two women drove from Texas to the Pacific Coast 
Highway, where they risked (almost) certain death driving up PCH toward 
San Francisco and Mount Shasta. On the way home, they stopped in Lake 
Tahoe, Salt Lake City, Denver and Roswell, where they toured the Roswell
 alien crash museum.<br/><br/>That same summer, she and Jeff went on their
 own Epiphany Quest across the eastern section of the United States. 
Lisa blogged the trip and reported on their adventures of driving a car 
that broke down more often than it ran, sipping moonshine in the hills 
of Kentucky, and finding salvation in the face of disaster (start reading <b><a href=""http://lisabonnice.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/from-a-bang-to-a-puff/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a></b>). Humorous and touching, this trip let Jeff and Lisa know that
 this is what they need to be doing with their lives: telling road 
stories.<br/><br/>Their next trip was to Washington DC to blog about Jon 
Stewart and Stephen Colbert’s Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear. Since
 then, they haven’t done any major traveling because life took them 
elsewhere for a while, but they’re now planning a 12-week trek across 
the UK, beginning in the mystical southwest, in search of Arthurian 
legends and the beauty of Devon, up into Wales, to see Doctor Who’s 
Cardiff and some of Jeff’s ancestral sites, through Liverpool to check 
out some Beatles history, up to Scotland to track down some of Lisa’s 
ancestors (including royalty!), sampling the UK’s tastiest 
local food and most beautiful country walks, and ending with a sunset 
snapshot over the Irish Sea from the top of Blackpool Tower. Lisa is 
already blogging about the trip at <b><a href=""http://lisabonnice.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/next-on-my-bucket-list-blackpool-england/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://lisabonnice.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/next-on-my-bucket-list-blackpool-england/</a></b><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/291109/files/20140104111558-bpl_tower_facebook.jpg?1388862958"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Lisa
 will be posting blogs and photos from the road. She’ll be using 
high-tech gadgets to do so, as she has learned from previous travel blog
 efforts how important good tech is to a trip like this. She’ll be 
learning how to use a smart phone, travel apps, new-fangled cameras and a
 travel-friendly computer to blog the trip, and writing “how-to” blogs 
for tech newbies as she learns. She has a keen eye for what makes for an
 odd or quirky story. She’s has an innate sense of direction and rarely 
gets lost. Of the two, Lisa is the trip navigator.<br/><br/>Jeff, on the 
other hand, barely knows how to turn on a computer. He can play video 
games and surf the web, but this technology will leave him flummoxed.  
He can’t take a non-blurry photo to save his life and texting on his 
cell phone is not on his list of “Things Jeff Enjoys”— however, he’s 
fun-loving, friendly, adventurous, and keeps Lisa from being too 
serious.

</h3><ul>
<li>My name is Lisa Bonnice, and I'm an author/radio show host. I'm working on a new writing project and need to do a lot of research in the United Kingdom. (Read my blog <b><a href=""http://lisabonnice.wordpress.com/2013/08/15/next-on-my-bucket-list-blackpool-england/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a></b>, for more information.) While I'm there, on this ""Bucket List"" trip, I intend to blog about technology and travel, interview British show biz folks (the ones we see on BBC America), write reviews about food and lodging, explore ancestral sites and walk across the countryside.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>I have a confirmed interview scheduled with <b><a href=""http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0661703/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sarah Parish</a></b>, the actress who played the female lead in <i>Blackpool</i>. She has also been on <i>Doctor Who </i>and numerous other BBC programs. She can currently be seen on BBC America, on Saturday nights, on their program <b><i><a href=""http://www.bbcamerica.com/atlantis/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Atlantis</a></i></b>. I have query letters sent out to numerous other British actors and am confident that I will land interviews with several.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>When I started planning this trip, the costs were covered, but the project that was going to pay for it fell through. I still need to do this, but funding has become an issue. Because I am doing something out of the ordinary, it's hard to pay for a project like this unless you're creative. So, I'm using this win-win method of raising money. You help me, I help you.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Your help will allow me to not only make a Bucket List event occur, I'll finally be able to get this book series written, as a result of the research I'll be doing. Plus, we'll all learn a LOT about the world, new technology and how to use it. And along the way, you'll find out who has the best Fish 'n' Chips in Great Britain!<br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>I am intending to raise at least $25,000 to pay for airfare and expenses for three months overseas (and continuing to pay my bills at home). Some of that money is to be raised through crowdfunding, some is through sponsorships,and some is just saving my pennies.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>I'm offering signed copies of all of my books, including one copy of my best-seller <i>Fear of Our Father</i>, signed by both me and my co-author Stacey M. Kananen.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>I'm looking for sponsors who are willing to pay for any of the following:<br/><br/><ol>
<li>Cell phones and service;</li>
<li>Travel friendly computers;</li>
<li>Airfare;</li>
<li>Lodging;</li>
<li>Car rental and other transportation.</li>
</ol>
<p><br/>Sponsors will be mentioned generously on blogs, vlogs, my radio show, and with logo/product placement. Sponsors for cell phones, for example, will be mentioned every time we talk or write about their use, i.e., if I'm writing about learning how to use the new phone, or discovering a trick that it can do, or if I'm posting a blog about being able to use the phone to find a restaurant or something. This type of thing will occur at least once a week.*<br/><br/>Cross-promotion is also a possibility! Nothing like a win-win to help everyone ... well ... win!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hans Decoz is possibly the best-known Numerologist in the world. His software program is the one used by Tarot.com. I own a licensed version of the same software and can generate identical reports.<br/><br/>A Personality Report, Diamond Report and a One-Year Forecast is valued at $45.<br/>(I'm asking $30)<br/><br/>A Compatibility Report is valued at $110.<br/>(I'm asking $75)<br/><br/>All I need is your full name at birth, the
 name you use now (how do you introduce yourself to people?) and your 
birthdate. I'll also need your email address to send the .pdf file to you.<br/></p></li>
</ul><ul><li>If I don't reach the entire goal, we're still going on the trip. It's just going to be a lot more Spartan than I'd like.</li></ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><ul>
<li>Bare minimum, I'll be able to write a series of metaphysical-comedy novels that are trying to push their way out of my brain. Also, I'll be telling fun stories on my blog about the trip, and showing you the world--including Doctor Who museums and shooting locations. If you're a fan of BBC America, like I am, you'll enjoy this a lot.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>The world is getting smaller and smaller. In many ways, we feel closer to each other, thanks to the Internet, but in other ways we feel isolated and at odds. Part of this plan is to show that everyday life is just that, no matter where you live.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>I have a successful track record in connecting people. I've written four books, one of which is a best-seller and another includes a foreword by Neale Donald Walsch. I also <b><a href=""http://www.blogtalkradio.com/shapeshifting/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">host a show on BlogTalkRadio </a></b>that helps people to figure out how to fix what's broken in their lives and become happier and healthier while they do it.<br/><br/>

I am intending to raise at least $25,000 to pay for airfare and expenses for three months overseas (and continuing to pay my bills at home). Some of that money is to be raised through crowdfunding, some is through sponsorships,and some is just saving my pennies.

I'm offering signed copies of all of my books, including one copy of my best-seller Fear of Our Father, signed by both me and my co-author Stacey M. Kananen.

I'm looking for sponsors who are willing to pay for any of the following:
Cell phones and service;
Travel friendly computers;
Airfare;
Lodging;
Car rental and other transportation.

Sponsors will be mentioned generously on blogs, vlogs, my radio show, and with logo/product placement. Sponsors for cell phones, for example, will be mentioned every time we talk or write about their use, i.e., if I'm writing about learning how to use the new phone, or discovering a trick that it can do, or if I'm posting a blog about being able to use the phone to find a restaurant or something. This type of thing will occur at least once a week.*Cross-promotion is also a possibility! Nothing like a win-win to help everyone ... well ... win!

Hans Decoz is possibly the best-known Numerologist in the world. His software program is the one used by Tarot.com. I own a licensed version of the same software and can generate identical reports.A Personality Report, Diamond Report and a One-Year Forecast is valued at $45.(I'm asking $30)A Compatibility Report is valued at $110.(I'm asking $75)All I need is your full name at birth, the
 name you use now (how do you introduce yourself to people?) and your 
birthdate. I'll also need your email address to send the .pdf file to you.
If I don't reach the entire goal, we're still going on the trip. It's just going to be a lot more Spartan than I'd like.The Impact
Bare minimum, I'll be able to write a series of metaphysical-comedy novels that are trying to push their way out of my brain. Also, I'll be telling fun stories on my blog about the trip, and showing you the world--including Doctor Who museums and shooting locations. If you're a fan of BBC America, like I am, you'll enjoy this a lot.

The world is getting smaller and smaller. In many ways, we feel closer to each other, thanks to the Internet, but in other ways we feel isolated and at odds. Part of this plan is to show that everyday life is just that, no matter where you live.

I have a successful track record in connecting people. I've written four books, one of which is a best-seller and another includes a foreword by Neale Donald Walsch. I also host a show on BlogTalkRadio that helps people to figure out how to fix what's broken in their lives and become happier and healthier while they do it.

Other Ways You Can Help
I'd love it if you'd tell your friends about my books and radio show. Aside from Indiegogo, I'm also raising money other ways, like selling low-cost numerology reports and books. Every penny counts!

<p><i>The Golden Sun</i> is about how people develop their identity and come to understand their world. While the story is set in the early 20th century, the themes of the story’s characters are modeled after those of our own world; that is, it is set in a post-modern time when people begin to feel meaninglessness creep into their lives. The main character, Cezal, feels ""baseless,"" especially after the recent loss of his mother, and decides to jump on a train to visit her hometown to try and connect with her past. On the way, he meets many different people, all with different personal philosophies and ways of life, and comes to find himself more through them.</p>
<p>My name is Robert Shafer and I am the author of The Golden Sun. I wrote this book because I think there’s always more about ourselves to discover. We tend to think we know ourselves or know what we would do in any given situation, but this is often not the case. </p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will see and understand different perspectives about the world and in the process, come to understand yourself better. </p>
<p><strong>The Novel</strong></p>
<p><i>The Golden Sun</i> largely takes place on a train as the main character, Cezal, is on the way to his mother’s home town. With setting inspired by the Trans-Siberian Railway, the story follows his travels through late-summer, fall, and into winter. On the way, he meets many people, but among them, there are three whom he spends the most time with. The first is an old lady who is taking one last trip, while she’s still spry enough. She’s headed to a quaint mountain village known for their canola flower fields. She reflects on her life with him and they get into much philosophical conversation. The next character he meets is a young, wanna-be ideologue named Zamen, who’s on his way to a remote settlement for a fresh start, and to try and start a political movement to eventually take it over. The third character he meets is an artist named Alja, who is heading to her childhood town to try to reconnect and gain inspiration from her past. Cezal ends up joining her at her old house in the forest, where she continues with her art. While there, their isolation from the remoteness and the oncoming winter leads them to understanding each other in ways they never would have expected. Watch as their individual realities begin to melt away.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you like books that explore personal identity, that have to do with the meaning of life, and that have social commentary. <i>The Golden Sun</i> speaks to anyone who feels lost and wants to learn more about themselves, or who want to grapple with themes of meaning and morality in a new way.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope that The Golden Sun inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>What is my sense of self-identity based in?</li>
<li>What is my sense of morality and does this come into conflict with other people’s sense of morality? How does one go about reconciling this?</li>
<li>Do I accept the direction our society is headed in, and what is that direction?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing these questions will change us all for the better. </p>
<p><strong>The Book itself</strong></p>
<p><i>The Golden Sun</i> is written in 4 parts.</p>
<p>Part 1 contains the author’s note + chapters 1-3. This includes the exposition, which is the most significant portion of the book to deal with the main character, Cezal. It also includes the section with Iprazhan, the old lady. The things they talk about have to do with mortality, tenderness, ego, beauty, what is important in the end, and how to be a good person.</p>
<p>Part 2 contains chapters 4-6. This is the section with Zamen, the ideologue. His advice is far more Machiavellian and his character is supposed to fit much of the criteria for an übermensch-type figure. He talks about ideology, society, people’s self-conception, narratives, and what people “truly” want.</p>
<p>Part 3 contains chapters 7-9. This is the section with Alja, a painter, who’s headed back to her home town. She’s very disillusioned with the world and generally has a rather pessimistic outlook on life. Many of the trends with her have to do with disappointment, relationships, and self-importance.</p>
<p>Part 4 contains chapters 10-11. This is the cabin portion of the story. Here, the narrative begins to focus more and more on Alja as her reality becomes increasingly abstract.</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Robert Shafer is an undergraduate student at McGill University, studying Philosophy and Economics. His particular academic interests lie in moral theory, metaphysics, and philosophy of economics.<br/><br/>He wrote this book to comment and reflect on modern society in the hopes of sparking conversation and self-reflection about what it means to live in the modern world. How different is our world now from 100, or even 1,000 years ago? How have people changed in that time? What is societal progress, and are we progressing as a society? How is technology changing the way we create relationships and interact with the world? What is the role of the individual in the modern world? He feels that we are entering an age where the relationship between the individual and the wider world is changing more quickly than ever before, and that in order to handle these changes, we need to know ourselves better than ever. Particularly, he wanted to examine the concepts of self-identity, meaning, and morality in a more artistic way.<br/><br/>When not writing or studying for school, he likes to hang out with friends, sing karaoke (poorly), and go explore the outdoors.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Robert Shafer at ro.eo.sh@gmail.com and on Instagram @robert.shafer.author.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Please share my pre-sale campaign on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #thegoldensun and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so we can help amplify your efforts.</p>
<p>You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page.</p>
<p>Please share my book with 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it via text or direct message on social media.</p>

While there, their isolation from the remoteness and the oncoming winter leads them to understanding each other in ways they never would have expected. Watch as their individual realities begin to melt away.
You will love this book if you like books that explore personal identity, that have to do with the meaning of life, and that have social commentary. The Golden Sun speaks to anyone who feels lost and wants to learn more about themselves, or who want to grapple with themes of meaning and morality in a new way.
Ultimately, I hope that The Golden Sun inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
 

What is my sense of self-identity based in?
What is my sense of morality and does this come into conflict with other people’s sense of morality? How does one go about reconciling this?
Do I accept the direction our society is headed in, and what is that direction?

I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing these questions will change us all for the better. 
The Book itself
The Golden Sun is written in 4 parts.
Part 1 contains the author’s note + chapters 1-3. This includes the exposition, which is the most significant portion of the book to deal with the main character, Cezal. It also includes the section with Iprazhan, the old lady. The things they talk about have to do with mortality, tenderness, ego, beauty, what is important in the end, and how to be a good person.
Part 2 contains chapters 4-6. This is the section with Zamen, the ideologue. His advice is far more Machiavellian and his character is supposed to fit much of the criteria for an übermensch-type figure. He talks about ideology, society, people’s self-conception, narratives, and what people “truly” want.
Part 3 contains chapters 7-9. This is the section with Alja, a painter, who’s headed back to her home town. She’s very disillusioned with the world and generally has a rather pessimistic outlook on life. Many of the trends with her have to do with disappointment, relationships, and self-importance.
Part 4 contains chapters 10-11. This is the cabin portion of the story. Here, the narrative begins to focus more and more on Alja as her reality becomes increasingly abstract.

About the Author
Robert Shafer is an undergraduate student at McGill University, studying Philosophy and Economics. His particular academic interests lie in moral theory, metaphysics, and philosophy of economics.He wrote this book to comment and reflect on modern society in the hopes of sparking conversation and self-reflection about what it means to live in the modern world. How different is our world now from 100, or even 1,000 years ago? How have people changed in that time? What is societal progress, and are we progressing as a society? How is technology changing the way we create relationships and interact with the world? What is the role of the individual in the modern world? He feels that we are entering an age where the relationship between the individual and the wider world is changing more quickly than ever before, and that in order to handle these changes, we need to know ourselves better than ever. Particularly, he wanted to examine the concepts of self-identity, meaning, and morality in a more artistic way.When not writing or studying for school, he likes to hang out with friends, sing karaoke (poorly), and go explore the outdoors.For more information, you can connect with Robert Shafer at ro.eo.sh@gmail.com and on Instagram @robert.shafer.author.

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p>Seasons of the Birch is a historical fiction account of the perseverance, sacrifice, and resilience of a young U.S. Army Nurse, Ruth, at the end of World War II in the Philippines. Ruth’s challenges begin anew as she returns home to a changing country eager to forget her service in the post-war era of the late 1940s and 1950s.<br/><br/>My name is Susan Puska and I am the author of Seasons of the Birch. During WWII, ordinary people stepped forward to serve their nation in a time of need. I wrote this book because I wanted to tell untold stories of women, minorities, and others who were seldom recognized for their contributions. They returned home changed, many hoping to create a better life for themselves and the next generation as they faced old and new challenges.<br/><br/>Each person’s life is a hero’s journey between the forces of light and darkness. In reading this book, I hope through the main character, Ruth, who becomes a nurse in the early 1940s, you will discover a generation of young Americans as they struggle through challenges and adversity. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to explore how poverty, class, bigotry, conformity, and global war shaped America’s World War II generation, and how ordinary people met their challenges with perseverance and resilience.<br/><br/>Seasons of the Birch follows Ruth as she grows up under difficult circumstances in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula and volunteers for the U.S. Army Nurse Corps. Her war takes her to the Philippines where she serves in a general hospital unit during 1945. After the war, Ruth journeys to create a new life, marrying a fellow Army veteran, John, who suffers violent wartime flashbacks and anxiety. Together they seek comfort and renewal along the shores of Lake Superior as they build a life and family together during the late 1940s and 1950s.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you want to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore how regular people overcame poverty, hardship, and extraordinary challenges in America between the 1920s and 1950s.</li>
<li>Examine a time when everyday Americans served and survived the ugly brutality of global war.</li>
<li>Understand the healing power of nature.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>Seasons of the Birch speaks to military veterans, their families, women, and minorities who want to examine differing personal perspectives on war and service.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Seasons of the Birch inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue leading to engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How did America change during WWII socially, economically, and militarily?</li>
<li>Why and how were the wartime contributions of women and minorities consciously undervalued after the war?</li>
<li>Women and minorities in America pay a heavy cost for discrimination (racism and sexism). What is the national cost? What are the legacies today?</li>
<li>What myths - from the family level to the national level - were created after WWII? How do younger generations today view WWII and the role their families may have played in it?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing untold stories, and resilience against hardships and discrimination will change us all for the better.</p>
<h2><strong>The Book - Seasons of the Birch</strong></h2>The book is written in 5 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Introduction. </strong>This introduces the main setting of the Upper Peninsula, the people who inspired this story, and provides some historical context from the 1920s and 1930s to the war years and onward to the late 1940s to 1950s.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 Into the Storm</strong> - contains chapters 1-4. In this section the reader meets the main character, Ruth, as she overcomes poverty and tragedy to become a registered nurse. In 1945 she volunteers to serve in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps and leaves Michigan for the first time, ultimately crossing the Pacific Ocean on the Lurline troop transport ship under the threat of a Japanese submarine and kamikaze attacks. She transforms into a war nurse providing medical care to mounting casualties of battle and tropical diseases, as the Japanese forces fight to the death.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 A Kind of Victory</strong> - contains chapters 5-8. The war in the Pacific ends abruptly with the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki (killing between 129,000 and 226,000 civilians) and the surrender of Japan on August 15, 1945, but Ruth must remain in the Philippines with her hospital unit caring for casualties through the Christmas holiday until January 1946 when she is reassigned to the States for outprocessing. In the U.S., she struggles against indifference and discrimination while reckoning with her wartime experiences and moving forward with her life.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3 Return North</strong> - contains chapters 9-12. Ruth returns north to the Upper Peninsula to help her sister in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, where she gets a nursing position at the War Memorial Hospital. Soon after arriving, she works on a case involving burned Native American children that requires her to draw on her wartime experience, but also brings up wartime memories. She meets and marries a fellow Army veteran, hoping to build a good life together and raise a family. But she underestimates the depth of his post traumatic stress, and her ability to help and change him, which pushes her to make hard decisions for her family.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4 Bending to the Wind</strong> - contains chapter 13. Ruth is alone at the end of a long life. She reflects back on her marriage to John, and how their life developed, especially after the children left home to create their own lives. She assesses her experiences and wonders what lies ahead for her. Is there more for her to do? Or has she completed her journey?<br/> <h2><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h2>

Puska is a retired U.S. Army Colonel and President and CEO of KANAVA International, LLC — a service-disabled veteran-owned, women-owned small business working within international development that focuses on empowering the sustainability of local organizations and communities.<br/><br/>She was inspired to write this book by the life of her mother who served in the U.S. Army Nurse Corps during World War II, and her father who served as an aerial gunner in the European Theater in North Africa, Sicily, and on bombing missions over occupied Europe while based in England. She was moved by the courage and suffering of World War II veterans, many of whom faded away into their own personal struggles after the parades ended. Some veterans, like her mother, received little recognition or appreciation for their service after the war. Like many minorities as well, some women had difficulty obtaining their veteran’s benefits and were denied membership in veteran organizations.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Renaissance is dedicated to continuing to elevate the works of marginalized voices and fostering a culture of collaboration with our authors. We have been growing leaps and bounds in the past year, and there are a few important things to do to keep up with this growth.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The first thing we want to do this year is turn the company into a workers’ cooperative. We believe this is the best model for us; it’ll allow leadership to be truly democratic and our workers to have a real say in the decision-making process. This change is expensive, but we feel it’s the right time for us to make this move.</p>
<p>We’re also very close to reaching the point where we can apply for grants, but we've incurred some unforeseen expenses that are preventing us from taking these next step.</p>
<p>But the good news is that we have inventory surplus, a few very slightly damaged books we’d like to get off our hands, and tons of cool other things we can offer you, so we thought we’d get fundraising!</p>
</div><div>

Renaissance is dedicated to continuing to elevate the works of marginalized voices and fostering a culture of collaboration with our authors. We have been growing leaps and bounds in the past year, and there are a few important things to do to keep up with this growth.

What We Need & What You Get
The first thing we want to do this year is turn the company into a workers’ cooperative. We believe this is the best model for us; it’ll allow leadership to be truly democratic and our workers to have a real say in the decision-making process. This change is expensive, but we feel it’s the right time for us to make this move.
We’re also very close to reaching the point where we can apply for grants, but we've incurred some unforeseen expenses that are preventing us from taking these next step.
But the good news is that we have inventory surplus, a few very slightly damaged books we’d like to get off our hands, and tons of cool other things we can offer you, so we thought we’d get fundraising!

The rewards! 

5$ books!

50$ Your portrait (head and shoulders)

Wood and I am the author of <strong><i>I Just Want to Date Myself</i></strong>.<br/><br/>I wrote this book to empower high performing women to master their mindsets, heal their relationship with themselves, and find purpose and pleasure in life outside of their resumes, credentials, and promotion potential.<br/><br/>I remember my first meeting with Sue. A colleague of hers had recommended that she talk to me and she was coincidentally in town for a work meeting that allowed us to meet in person. I was impressed by Sue’s appearance, she was dressed to impress and had a beautiful set of gold jewelry on that really struck me. She gave off a very clear energy that she had it all together. She shared with me the field she was in, the level of leadership she had reached. She had poise and magnetism and it was hard not to fall in love with this woman.<br/><br/>Curious to discover why we were meeting, I asked her to share with me why she was curious to meet me. Sue shared that she had been in the same field for nearly two decades at this point. She had reached a level of leadership in her company that set her apart. She had just bought a home and everything appeared to be working for her and yet, her life felt joyless and like there was something missing. She found herself continually being the yes woman in the office, the resident mentor who was always giving to everyone else and not to herself. Sue shared that she was one of the highest performers in her office, but with each additional contract won or new level attained, she would find herself in the same position of momentarily feeling good about herself and then right back to striving for the next achievement.<br/><br/>I wrote this book for Sue, for myself, and for all the high performers out there who find themselves in a similar place of wondering if there isn’t a different way to live. A different path that provides for more fulfillment, joy, meaning, and even impact. Sue’s story isn’t unique, it is common. I’ve spoken with thousands of individuals who resonate with the themes shared here. While sometimes I notice we can avoid being willing to acknowledge our own dissatisfaction or discontent, when we do, we can create the possibility for lasting change.<br/><br/>As a high performer myself, there is a fine line between getting our needs met from within versus sourcing them from our accomplishments or efforts to please others. The challenge with sourcing our happiness or fulfillment from our successes or results is that we never win at that game. We embark on an endless mission for results, temporarily feeling good about ourselves, only to reach for the next goal, the next deadline or project, it’s always the next, and we will find little true meaning or satisfaction.<br/><br/>This book serves as a guide providing another way of accessing the joy and satisfaction that we all long for, and it’s one other than reaching for the next big milestone or goal. It will require a willingness to look within and begin meeting our own needs individually versus leveraging our accomplishments and people pleasuring efforts to put a Band-Aid on our loneliness and discontent.<br/><br/><strong>My hope is that, in reading this book:</strong></p><ul>
<li>You will discover a path, a framework, and even a how to, to reinvent the fundamental ways in which you view yourself, access your self-worth, and find joy, meaning and wonder in who you are.</li>
<li>You will discover the same delight and excitement that I have for celebrating myself and discover your own ability to see the beauty within you.</li>
<li>You will see the book as a resource to help you put these new concepts of acknowledging and celebrating yourself into action so that you can tangibly walk through life with more joy and purpose in your step, with more clarity and power in your voice, and with more intimacy and connectedness in your relationships.</li>
</ul><p>If you think you could benefit from a healthy dose of treating yourself better, whether it be a date, your self-talk, a vacation, or even a gift, then this is the book for you.<br/><br/><i><strong>I Just Want to Date Myself</strong></i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to high performing women and driven joy seekers who are looking to master their mindsets, heal their relationship with themselves, and find purpose and pleasure in life and in their careers separate from their resumes, credentials, and promotion potential for the first time.</p><p> </p><h2>The Book - I Just Want To Date Myself</h2><p> </p><p>The book is written in five parts, with readings and exercises for each day and book club questions for each week so that this book can be read and digested with others...</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Week 1: Mindset</strong> contains the introduction plus the first week of daily lessons on the power of your beliefs and reprogramming our subconscious thoughts. You will learn how to begin getting curious about versus reactive to the people in your life who trigger you and begin discovering how what you cannot be with in them is a mirror for what you cannot be with in yourself. You will learn more about terminal uniqueness and people pleasing and begin to employ tactical ways of choosing differently.</li>
<li>
<strong>Week 2: Spending Quality Time with Yourself</strong> contains some of my favorite lessons, practices and rituals on beginning to spend connected time with yourself. You will rediscover the joy in what you like to do, how you most enjoy spending free time with yourself, and you will begin to date yourself. You will also begin to employ practices that will have you know the answer to the timeless question — “what do you want and need right now?” You will get more connected with the parts of yourself that you have ignored or not heeded and begin to reconnect with all the parts of self.</li>
<li>
<strong>Week 3: Embrace and Celebrate</strong> dives deeper into some of the topics that likely prevent you from being fully self-expressed and actualized in your life. You will learn methods to access more vulnerability in life, gain a greater sense of belonging, go head-to-head with perfectionism, and examine deeper the ways in which imposter syndrome hold you back and how you can opt out.</li>
<li>
<strong>Week 4: It Takes A Village</strong> covers the fourth week of lessons on the importance of community, our inherent need for it, and how you can begin fostering community when yours is lacking.</li>
<li>
<strong>Week 5: Full Self-Expression</strong> covers the fifth and final week of lessons on how you can capitalize on your one wild and precious life. You will being to integrate the learnings of this book in week five and connect them with your values, your goals, and your purpose.</li>

<p>Hace un par de años emprendí mi nuevo camino, mi aventura hacia lo desconocido.</p>
<p><b>¡Y en unos meses conseguí escribir mis locuras, alucinaciones, imaginaciones, sueños, realidades y verdades! ¡Alucinante!</b></p>
<p>De aquí surgió <b>EL DIAMANTE DE HERKIMER</b>, una novela de aventuras que tenía que ser ser editada como libro electrónico en <b>catalán, castellano e inglés</b>, y vendible por todo el mundo en los tres idiomas. <br/></p>
<p>Conseguí los dos primeros, pero el inglés quedó apartado hasta que los ingresos futuros me permitiesen sufragar la inversión. <br/></p>
<p>Pero hasta el momento no ha sido posible.<br/></p>
<p>No obstante , como muchos amigos y conocidos me pidieron su versión en papel, <b>pagué de mi bolsillo,</b> igual que con los ebooks, una mini-edición de la novela en catalán, que me ha proyectado a realizar diferentes presentaciones.

</div></div>","Quien soy
 Me llamo David Frigola Fontacaba. Soy de Figueres (Girona, Spain). Tengo 34 años y siempre me ha gustado escribir. Durante diez años publiqué artículos para periódicos locales, presentando relatos breves a concursos, hasta conseguir mi meta personal que era escribir mi primera novela. 
Ahora con vuestra sincera y grata colaboración necesito un último empujoncito para poder traducir y publicar como ebook EL DIAMANTE DE HERKIMER AL INGLÉS.



Mi ilusión

Hace un par de años emprendí mi nuevo camino, mi aventura hacia lo desconocido.
¡Y en unos meses conseguí escribir mis locuras, alucinaciones, imaginaciones, sueños, realidades y verdades! ¡Alucinante!
De aquí surgió EL DIAMANTE DE HERKIMER, una novela de aventuras que tenía que ser ser editada como libro electrónico en catalán, castellano e inglés, y vendible por todo el mundo en los tres idiomas. 
Conseguí los dos primeros, pero el inglés quedó apartado hasta que los ingresos futuros me permitiesen sufragar la inversión. 
Pero hasta el momento no ha sido posible.
No obstante , como muchos amigos y conocidos me pidieron su versión en papel, pagué de mi bolsillo, igual que con los ebooks, una mini-edición de la novela en catalán, que me ha proyectado a realizar diferentes presentaciones. Tengo fotos y vídeos en mi web www.davidfrigola.com



¡Vuestra ayuda es indispensable!

En 2013 conseguí los derechos para vender mis ebooks en Europa, América y Asia y luego los publiqué en AMAZON.
Me encuentro en una situación crucial para llegar hasta mi meta. Reconozco lo difícil que es que alguien que no me conozca invierta en mí, el casi imposible reto de conseguir la cuantía necesaria para mi propósito...

¡¡¡ AUNQUE ESPERO QUE CON VUESTRA AYUDA E INTERÉS MI SUEÑO SE HAGA REALIDAD!!!
