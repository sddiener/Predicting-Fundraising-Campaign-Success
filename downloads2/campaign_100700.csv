<i>Lilly: The Beginning of TagaPet</i><br/>
</h1>
<p>My family has owned dogs my entire life, but it was not until two years ago that I adopted my first dog. I had a co-worker who was giving away puppies and I couldn't resist. Against my parents better judgement, I decided to adopt Lilly.  I quickly felt those new parent feelings of love, attachment, and anxiety. </p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>A ""Ruff"" Problem</i></b></h1>
<p>My new idea caused me to wonder about other lost pets. After doing some research, I realized that lost pets are a much bigger problem than I thought. Here are a few of the stats that really stood out to me. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1 in 3 pets will be lost in their lifetime. </b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>5-7 million pets are lost each year in the United States.</b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Less than 15% of dogs and 2% of cats are returned to their owners!</b><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I knew I had stumbled upon a large problem that affected millions of people. With the amount of technology we have today, isn't there more we can do? </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>TagaPet is Born</i></b></h1>
<p>Then it hit me, nowadays basically everyone has a smartphone, so what if there was a pet tag that could be scanned by a smartphone to access more information? I decided to run the idea by my two pet loving friends Mac and Ben. They shared my enthusiasm, so after college we formed the company TagaPet.</p>
<p>It has been a little over a year now since we formed TagaPet. We have spent our time learning about the industry, studying pet behavior, building prototypes, and developing our system. <b>We have sold our prototype Argos Tags in 19 different states, tagged over 115 pets, and had pets returned using our system!</b> Here is a short video explaining what TagaPet is today:</p>

</ul>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Why We Need Money</i></h1>
<p>The TagaPet team was recently accepted into an international business accelerator called StartupBootcamp (<a href=""http://www.startupbootcamp.org/programs/nfc-contactless.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here</a> to find out more about the program). To be accepted into this program is a huge honor and brings us one step closer to solving the problem of lost pets.

Lilly: The Beginning of TagaPet

As pet owners, we still rely on the archaic metal engraved pet tag that has been around for centuries. What if I was able to make an affordable tag that was more than a name and phone number? Lilly's tag should do more than just dangle; it should ACTIVELY help guide her home.

(I am merely the fundraiser on a mission)He just come home from one visit but are fundraising to get back there as soon as possible.  Please see the Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Nepal-Emergency-Shelter-Home-Appeal/720832181373102Our twitter account is https://twitter.com/BuildinNepalWe are asking that people who feel that they are able to contribute to building a future for this area of the world do so. Solidarity means a lot to those out there. Just knowing that someone, somewhere cared enough to keep them dry and support their life makes a difference. Please read the story on the picture and you can see that evidence. Thank you. £95 is one home and then we have flights and visas. Nobody stays in lavish facilities, again, please see the Facebook page and you can see how it works. This is simply real people helping real people in the fastest, most practical no-nonsense way possible.  Honesty is crucial and this campaign is not expected to be easily achieved but we hope that people support and while we cannot make a difference to everyone in need, we can help as many as possible and so can you. :)This campaign has no political or religious bias, this is purely humans helping humans. Any questions welcomed. Thanks again.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

It looks like we will start shipping out in October. Please contact - info@comprest.ca - before ordering, if the timing is a concern.Thank you for very much for your interest and for your patience.You can currently secure your order at  -  www.comprest.ca Do you remember your last air mattress experience? Oh boy, do I remember mine.It took forever to inflate. I missed the sunset and had to make dinner in the dark. Before crawling into bed around midnight I had to re-inflate because of air chill and science, but still woke up at 5 am in an air-mattress-taco with the full weight of my slumbering girlfriend against me. Cold. Sore. Grumpy. I'm an avid camper and, like most campers, I've clearly developed a deep hatred for air mattresses.The alternatives? One option is the self-inflatable – typically for back-country hikers and not very comfortable.The other choice is foam. Foam is good! It’s reliable, never pops… your bed at home is likely made of foam. It's a bummer foam is just too big for camping...UNLESS, of course, you vacuum-pack it.We're here to give you the most reliable sleep you’ll find in a camping bed. CompREST is designed for the Outdoor Bed Marketplace targeted at car, music festival, and base campers.CompREST is NOT ideal for backpacking or hiking trips, but most hikers still practice car camping for more comfortable weekend trips.Perfect for:
                                                            Here's how it all goes down. Compression time-lapse. Actual time: 2-3 minutesYou wake up well rested on your last day at camp and take down is a breeze. Fold it, seal it in your vacuum bag, and CompREST packs your bed up for you at the touch of a button, to 20% of its original size.As for set up time... What set up time?Setting up your nap nest has never been easier! Simply remove the bag and your bed is made. This is NOT a time lapse.Step 1: Remove from bag. Step 2: Adventure time! Luxurious foam made convenient for the first time ever.It all starts with the right foam. We knew we needed foam that was guaranteed comfortable, but we also needed to ensure our foam could pack up small yet still maintain integrity and shape when out of the bag.After a lot of lying around (on foam, of course) we landed on one with the perfect density: a cross between supreme comfort, give, and resiliency. We’re especially stoked that this perfect foam is formed only a province away in beautiful Vancouver! Not only are we supporting local Canadian business, we also get faster delivery times.How comfy is it? We have more reward details and instructions at the bottom of this page. Make sure to take a look at our Add On Menu.What about the pump?It sucks, trust me.
1st of it's kind. The CompREST Vacuum Pump.The true innovation (and the muscle) behind the CompREST system is our rechargeable vacuum pump.Vacuum pack your bed, pillows, clothes, bedding, and even food. You’ll end up with extra room in your car for more important things! Like a friend, your dog, or another flat of beer…The power of a shop-vac in the palm of your hand. 7 ½ x 3 ¼ x 5 ½ inches. This little thing is a featherweight champion, weighing only 2.6 lbs.   CompREST’s RECHARGEABLE lithium-ion batteries will do 20 compressions on a single charge, and can be recharged using a 110V American (2-prong) wall charger (included). A simple LED indicator demonstrates charging status. Red means charging, green means good-to-go!Did we mention it can charge your phone?""These Li-ion batteries ARE GREAT! How else can we make use of this excess energy?""   Bingo! Your CompREST pump also acts as a portable power bank for your phone or other USB device, offering 5V and 1A of power. The pump is capable of fully charging a Samsung Galaxy, from dead, at least twice. Friction Fit, press on nozzle.The CompREST nozzle is specially designed to fit securely on the valve - you don’t have to babysit. Set it and forget it (for a few minutes, at least)! Use this precious time to do other camp take-down tasks – like packing up your bag or enjoying that second cup of coffee. The design doesn't stop there. So far, almost 100 people have slept on CompREST and we've had hundreds of people lay on the product at trade shows. The response is always overwhelmingly positive, AKA ""Ahhhhhhh, ya. That's nice.""Our testers have provided us with valuable input regarding appearance, functionality, necessity, and ease of use. We have used this input to develop the whole CompREST experience into something that is enjoyable, intuitive, and aesthetically pleasing – an experience that will have you wondering how you ever managed before CompREST.This ain’t your mama’s camping mattress! Throwback to those huge, yellowing, fragile foam mattresses that used to embody camping in the 1970s.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise funding to produce a Dynasphere to be located somewhere in Europe where it can be readily accessed. The final location is yet to be determined and contributors will be informed. We have constructed and delivered five Dynaspheres in the US. Now it is time to send Dynaspheres all over the world beginning in Europe. These amazing devices encourage personal Awakening to Cosmic Consciousness of who and what they really are. You are a flow of Love. See more Dynasphere details <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/3d3224r"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""here"">here</a>. </p>

Each is hand made of specific and sometimes special materials and craftsmanship is high quality. It normally takes several months to construct one in our shop.

The Impact




Being exposed over time to a Dynasphere has changed many people's lives. These are real changes at the heart (deep consciousness) level.

These phenomena have been repeated over years and have occurred with all five units already distributed across America.

<h3 class=""big_type""><em>Important notes.</em></h3>
<h3><strong><em>We will deliver the products also if we don't reach the target - We've found investors</em></strong></h3>
<p>The project appeared to be so successful that we got many term sheets from venture capital. This refers to millions of <span class=""caps"">USD</span>. Currently we conduct negotiations with investors who contacted us.</p>
<p>In this way, people who would like to place a pre-order for $1500 but are afraid that we will not raise the required amount of money at IndieGoGo, should not worry, expences will be covered by venture capital. I’s not the time to be afraid but to buy it for $ 1500, with a discount, we will roll-up the production, there is no doubt.</p>

<h3 class=""big_type"">Unique hi-tech motorbike helmet with built-in navigation system and voice controlled interface.</h3>
</div>
<div class=""full-description"">
<h2>The Challenge</h2>
Motorcyclists still need an <strong>effective navigation tool</strong> except the usual paper maps or touch-screen navigators. Using maps requires frequent stops, navigators distract the biker’s attention and are not safe to be operated on the go.
<p>There is a device that would perfectly meet the bikers’ requirements but up to the present day only fighter pilots could enjoy its advantages. Yes, we mean <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmet-mounted_display"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">helmet-mounted displays</a>.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>We worked a lot and now <strong>have a solution</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>augmented reality for easy and user-friendly navigation</li>
<li>clearly visible collimated image i.e. it is always in focus, just like that in scope sights</li>
<li>full-color, translucent picture is projected right on the visor like in a F-35 fighter helmet, it's safe, provides unobstructed view, doesn't distract attention and eliminates the need for a separate display</li>
<li>supposed size of the system fits a motorcycle helmet - our helmet is going to be just a bit bigger than usual</li>
<li>two 3000 mAh batteries for a long operation time</li>
<li>microphone for voice control that keeps both hands free for driving</li>
<li>two earphones</li>
<li>light sensor for adjusting the image brightness according to external light conditions</li>
<li>G-sensor, gyroscope, digital compass for head movement tracking  (the picture changes according to the view direction)</li>
<li>our own minimalistic interface that will be used instead of standard Android interface. <strong>Thus you will not be able to play games or watch video on the go, sorry!</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s017.radikal.ru/i429/1306/5f/db595d232bca.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>
<p>Despite sophisticated modern technologies being at the heart of product it is going to be easy to use. In fact, its future owners are going to touch the futuristic technology formerly seen only in sci-fi movies.</p>

<h2>Current State</h2>
<p>The project got support of Moscow Department of Science, Industrial Policy and Enterprise; State Foundation for Assistance to Small Innovative Enterprises in Science and Technology of Russian Federation; Skolkovo Foundation.Currently with their financial support we made prototypes for:</p>

<h2>Why Crowd Funding?</h2>
<p>Our project origins from Russia. Russian venture funds are not disposed to invest into hardware startups. They prefer to back up clones of successful services like Groupon, Airnb, Zappos, Yelp, Booking, etc. They are not interested in producing hardware either. Thus we got some grants from the Government, but this seed capital is not unlimited, and is intended for making prototypes. We, like <a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/hw.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Paul Graham</a>, believe that the time of hardware startups is coming and they can begin a new era by crowd funding, i.e. fundraising and pre-selling.</p>

<h2>How We will Use Raised Funds</h2>
<p>Money will be payed for making pressmolds for the helmet capsule. It's a rather expensive tooling and is vitally important for the whole project.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why is the price $2.000? Isn't it too high?</h3>
<p><span>If you make a comparison with the price of a <strong>good helmet</strong> (whatever that means, it's a matter of personal taste), then add the price of a communication unit (for Internet connection and downloading of essential info like traffic, POI, weather etc. - supposed hardware specifications are going to be as good as of current <strong>high-end Android smartphones</strong>), and a price of a <strong>good GPS</strong> along with its mounting kit, the price adds up.</span></p>
<p><span>This is all integral, all for one price and the helmet will be made out of carbon fiber, as opposed to polycarbonate.</span><br/><br/><span>When the products are compared like-for-like, the price isn't quite as daunting. It seems steep at first glance.</span></p>
<p>Do not forget that we are planning to add Bluetooth headset functionality and a high-resolution camera if we raise enough money. Then add a price of a <strong>headset</strong> and an <strong>action camera</strong> (with projection optics like that used in reflex cameras and with 13 mpx resolution) and compare the result with just $2000 for an integrated device.</p>
<p>We think, it's a good deal!</p>
<h3>What size will the helmet be?</h3>
<p>The overall dimensions of the helmet will be slightly bigger than those of an average helmet (you know, we need some extra space for electronics and optics inside).</p>
<p>As for antropometry - we will make helmets of standard S, M, L and XL sizes, just as usual.</p>
<h3>What color will the helmet be?</h3>
<p>The prototype shown in the video is used for showing the overall dimensions and approximata shape of the helmet. Final color as well as shape details may vary. Yes, we know about industrial design and its importance.</p>
<h3>How much will the helmet weight?</h3>
<p>It will weight about 1.4 kg, as said in the video.</p>
<h3>How do you load the map?</h3>
<p>Maps are going to be pre-loaded, no need for downloading the maps on the go. You will be able to update maps on a regular basis.</p>
<h3><span>How well does the head-up display work on a clear visor in daylight? <span>How bright is the maps image at night</span></span></h3>
<p>The image is going to be bright enough to be well visible at daytime (it's a very important point for us, be sure).</p>
<p>The image brightness will be automatically adjusted (dimmed) according to light conditions at night or at cloudy weather (we have foreseen a light sensor for it). Thus the image will remain well wisible but will not dazzle your eyes. </p>
<h3>Will your navigation system be online or offline (i.e. will I need Internet connection to make routes)?</h3>
<p>You will not need Internet connection for making routes. We use our own engine to do it. Internet will be required for downloading updates, traffic information, POIs and weather forecast.</p>

<p>PS BIG THANKS all journalists &amp; tv-reporters in the world, who made and will make news about Livemap motohelmet.</p></div>","Important notes.
We will deliver the products also if we don't reach the target - We've found investors
The project appeared to be so successful that we got many term sheets from venture capital. This refers to millions of USD. Currently we conduct negotiations with investors who contacted us.
In this way, people who would like to place a pre-order for $1500 but are afraid that we will not raise the required amount of money at IndieGoGo, should not worry, expences will be covered by venture capital. I’s not the time to be afraid but to buy it for $ 1500, with a discount, we will roll-up the production, there is no doubt.
 
Unique hi-tech motorbike helmet with built-in navigation system and voice controlled interface.


The Challenge
Motorcyclists still need an effective navigation tool except the usual paper maps or touch-screen navigators. Using maps requires frequent stops, navigators distract the biker’s attention and are not safe to be operated on the go.
There is a device that would perfectly meet the bikers’ requirements but up to the present day only fighter pilots could enjoy its advantages. Yes, we mean helmet-mounted displays.
 

The Solution
We worked a lot and now have a solution:


augmented reality for easy and user-friendly navigation
clearly visible collimated image i.e. it is always in focus, just like that in scope sights
full-color, translucent picture is projected right on the visor like in a F-35 fighter helmet, it's safe, provides unobstructed view, doesn't distract attention and eliminates the need for a separate display
supposed size of the system fits a motorcycle helmet - our helmet is going to be just a bit bigger than usual
two 3000 mAh batteries for a long operation time
microphone for voice control that keeps both hands free for driving
two earphones
light sensor for adjusting the image brightness according to external light conditions
G-sensor, gyroscope, digital compass for head movement tracking  (the picture changes according to the view direction)
our own minimalistic interface that will be used instead of standard Android interface. Thus you will not be able to play games or watch video on the go, sorry!




Despite sophisticated modern technologies being at the heart of product it is going to be easy to use. In fact, its future owners are going to touch the futuristic technology formerly seen only in sci-fi movies.
 

Pay attention to the above schema. It tells you why we place the image in the center of view field. That's because this is the area where you see best. At the same time there are areas (on the left or on the right for example) where your vision is not so sharp.  
 

 

User Interface

The user interface is going to be minimalistic and simple. The list of of voice commands will be short, all commands natural and understandable by context. For the case the user is in trouble formulating a suitable command the help option is just a command (""Help!"") away.
 

 
Overview map can be viewed anytime your speed is near zero (showing map at high speed is prohibited due to safety reasons).
 

 
POI search and display is not forgotten either.
 

Current State
The project got support of Moscow Department of Science, Industrial Policy and Enterprise; State Foundation for Assistance to Small Innovative Enterprises in Science and Technology of Russian Federation; Skolkovo Foundation.Currently with their financial support we made prototypes for:

outer shell
electronic board
optics
software

Why Crowd Funding?
Our project origins from Russia. Russian venture funds are not disposed to invest into hardware startups. They prefer to back up clones of successful services like Groupon, Airnb, Zappos, Yelp, Booking, etc. They are not interested in producing hardware either. Thus we got some grants from the Government, but this seed capital is not unlimited, and is intended for making prototypes. We, like Paul Graham, believe that the time of hardware startups is coming and they can begin a new era by crowd funding, i.e. fundraising and pre-selling.
 

How We will Use Raised Funds
Money will be payed for making pressmolds for the helmet capsule. It's a rather expensive tooling and is vitally important for the whole project.
Please learn more about injection molding.
 

Our Goals
We went a long and hard way. Our next, the most important and the most challenging step is to put all parts together and to start industrial production: 

complete engineering of optics and electronics for industrial production
finish the software development
conduct final tests and certification procedures
start serial production of the helmet

 
2013, 4Q: Engineering and making press moulds.
2014, 1Q: Certification according to FCC and DOT industrial standards.
2014, 2Q: Producing a pilot batch of helmets.
2014, 3Q: Market launch in USA and Canada.2014, 4Q: Market launch in Australia and UK.
We have a dream and want it to come true. It's a chance to create some thing nobody created yet. We'll do all our best.
 



Stretched Goals
300 000$
Bluetooth with headset profile (for using the helmet as a headset).
500 000$
Built-in high-resolution 13Mpix photo&video camera.
 



Certification
The helmet will be certificated according to the following standards:

USA DOT
European ECE 22.05
Japanese JIS T 8133 
FCC

FAQ
Why is the price $2.000? Isn't it too high?
If you make a comparison with the price of a good helmet (whatever that means, it's a matter of personal taste), then add the price of a communication unit (for Internet connection and downloading of essential info like traffic, POI, weather etc. - supposed hardware specifications are going to be as good as of current high-end Android smartphones), and a price of a good GPS along with its mounting kit, the price adds up.
This is all integral, all for one price and the helmet will be made out of carbon fiber, as opposed to polycarbonate.When the products are compared like-for-like, the price isn't quite as daunting. It seems steep at first glance.
Do not forget that we are planning to add Bluetooth headset functionality and a high-resolution camera if we raise enough money. Then add a price of a headset and an action camera (with projection optics like that used in reflex cameras and with 13 mpx resolution) and compare the result with just $2000 for an integrated device.
We think, it's a good deal!
What size will the helmet be?
The overall dimensions of the helmet will be slightly bigger than those of an average helmet (you know, we need some extra space for electronics and optics inside).
As for antropometry - we will make helmets of standard S, M, L and XL sizes, just as usual.
What color will the helmet be?
The prototype shown in the video is used for showing the overall dimensions and approximata shape of the helmet. Final color as well as shape details may vary. Yes, we know about industrial design and its importance.
How much will the helmet weight?
It will weight about 1.4 kg, as said in the video.
How do you load the map?
Maps are going to be pre-loaded, no need for downloading the maps on the go. You will be able to update maps on a regular basis.
How well does the head-up display work on a clear visor in daylight? How bright is the maps image at night
The image is going to be bright enough to be well visible at daytime (it's a very important point for us, be sure).
The image brightness will be automatically adjusted (dimmed) according to light conditions at night or at cloudy weather (we have foreseen a light sensor for it). Thus the image will remain well wisible but will not dazzle your eyes. 
Will your navigation system be online or offline (i.e. will I need Internet connection to make routes)?
You will not need Internet connection for making routes. We use our own engine to do it. Internet will be required for downloading updates, traffic information, POIs and weather forecast.

The main reason for this is that they direct the weight away from your body. JOEY is different!A full contact, super ergonomic back suspension system directs the weight towards your hips and lays JOEY right against your back. A contoured hip pad absorbs the weight and reduces horizontal movements when walking or running. Load lifter straps and stowable hip and strenum straps provide maximum comfort. Multi-directional air flow tunnels provide pleasant ventilation and keep your back dry at all times.  The sternum strap with a Nifco® buckle and a Duraflex® slider is stowable to prevent it from dangling when not used. That's right, enough is enough: no more dangling straps!The hip strap can also be stowed (correct, NO MORE dangling straps!) and features a Fidlock® SNAP fastener, which combines the convenience of a magnetic fastener with the stability of a mechanical snap fastener.  JOEY has a pair of easy to use side pockets. Actually, they feel like additional pants pockets because they are so accessible. You can take out your smart phone, wallet, or keys, on the go, and stow them safely to have the hands free again.There is also one-handed access to full length side mesh pockets that can carry larger things such as a water bottle.  Don't worry about your valuables, they are safe! By teaming up with Fidlock®, a German fastener manufacturer, JOEY is the pick-pockets’ new nightmare. Strong magnets makes the Fidlock® fastener easy to close but the secure snap functionality ensures a continuously high locking force. You have to feel it to believe it!Another cool thing? Your passport has its own hidden pocket facing towards your back, which can be accessed without taking off JOEY – perfect while traveling.  We get it: you carry around a lot, from laptops to water bottles and you really stuff your backpack. What if you need additional space? Check this out!There is lots of space. In fact, there is additional capacity of 15 liters so you are prepared for the unexpected. JOEY expands in a very unique way but always retains its balance. And its style.  JOEY is made to carry your life and offers ample pockets for organizing the small things in the most intuitive locations. Things you frequently take out throughout the day like your charger or sunglasses can be packed conveniently in the big pocket in the top lid.By gently pulling down the top lid, the Fidlock® SNAP unfastens and you will first find a large, integrated laptop compartment.When opening the YKK® zippers, you access the interior offering countless ways to stow things like your power-bank, notebook, or pens.With the super lightweight, stowable rain cover you are good to go in all wheathers. If it is not raining, it fits nicely into a separate pocket located outside at the bottom.  JOEY stands for uncompromising quality and visionary design. While designing this masterpiece, we placed great importance on durability and only used water-repellent fabrics as well as multi-award winning components from Fidlock®, YKK®, Nifco®, and Duraflex®. JOEY is a true premium everyday backpack.

After collaborating with one of the top solar energy companies in the development of a variety of solar farms in Spain, our research has shown that the flexible panels, in comparison to the majority of rigid panels, are much more effective , meaning our devices are charged much more efficiently.  

 
 
FEATURES
The initial backpack is a blue/grey colour, but we shall be offering them in other fashionable colours to capture clients of all ages and tastes.

 
 
 
The backpack is designed to hold all the new technological portable electronic devices and contains a sleeve in its interior to store laptops of up to 17” and to charge a tablet, ipad, GPS etc., and a variety of extra pockets which are ideal for holding accessories or mobile phones etc. 

It is a perfect option for travelling or spending time outdoors, maybe on the beach, a picnic in the mountain, a day cycling or camping.
Always have your batteries fully charged.
 With the solar panel being removable it gives you the possibility to leave your device charging in the sun while you can dedicate your time to other things.



OUR OBJECTIVE
We have been working on the idea of this product for many months. We have travelled the world, meeting with designers and manufacturers and have choosen the materials to make this product the most efficient and productive.
The product has been tested and is now ready for large scale production.
Where the funds are destined:


flexible panel order
Backpack manufacturing order
Marketing
Continue with the investigation and development of solar energy products


We have the best suppliers and manufactures ready and just need to raise this money to meet the initial order quantity of 300 units. If we are able to raise more than this initial amount we will be able to  produce a greater quantity which shall reduce the production costs, meaning we can reduce the retail price, thus making this product the best value on the market and also making the solar backpack accessible to everyone, but always maintaining the quality.
We already have meetings organised to hold enviromental awareness conferences in schools, explaining the importance of renewable energy now and for the future. Your collaboration will give us the chance to produce this innovative product giving our future generations the chance to step forward into a healthier, greener enviroment. Enabling people to always be connected, no matter what the circumstances. Never again will they be in a difficult situation with not enough battery power to make that important call or connect with the ones they love.



The sun is free, now is the time to benefit from it

At Lake Tahoe Backcountry Guides we will provide you with the best lightweight gear, delicious food, and fun, knowledgeable, experienced guides. Our guides have professional medical training and even some military experience. We will show you some of the most amazing sights you have ever seen. Most people never get to see the remarkable side of the Lake Tahoe wilderness, but we will show you all of the coolest spots. We will set up your tents once we get to camp and even cook you fantastic meals so your vacation can be spent relaxing. The spectacular views that we will guide you to along our tours are simply breathtaking so make sure you bring your camera. After one of our trips you will be dying to get back out into the wilderness. Your love of the outdoors will grow exponentially after you experience the beauty of the Lake Tahoe wilderness. You will feel so accomplished after you finish your trek that you will want to book your next adventure right away. The money raised here will go to purchasing the items necessary to start guiding tours. We have to buy good items like backpacks, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, pillows, tents, headlamps, and trekking pokes. We also need to purchase all of the elements for the snacks and meals that we'll make and provide. We will need things like a vacuum sealer, food dehydrator, and ingredients. We love the outdoors and this would be the perfect opportunity to share the wilderness with others and through teaching ""leave no trace"" principals to those we explore with we can ensure the wilderness will stay that way for others to enjoy as well.

We will have print ads in high end publications like Forbes, Travel and Leisure, Martha Stewart Living, Afar, Global Living Magazine, and Sunset magazines. <br/>After the project is funded we can start fulfilling the rewards shortly after as most of them are guided tours. All we need to do is purchase the equipment needed to lead these amazing tours. <br/>Another risk and challenge that we could face after the project is funded is competition.

We pride ourselves in taking care of the details that our guests will absolutely love. We first focused on the weight of the packs overall. At just under 15 pounds, you will be blown away knowing all of your gear is packed away in there. We have also focused on the best, most photogenic routes in the area.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">allGreenup focuses not only on a limited and green audience.
It starts from there strengthening  good
habits, but also seeks to spread to those who have not yet developed a
sustainable lifestyle awareness. For them offers benefits such as free movie
tickets, ski tickets or tickets to concerts, among others. And since we
understand that many people take care of the planet without wanting to receive
anything in return, app users can donate their points to institutions working
for the environment. For example, we currently have available the possibility
of planting a tree together with the Chilean foundation “Reforestemos la
Patagonia” in the allGreenup forest located in the southern part of Chile.</p><p><br/></p>

recyclers can freely perform residential collection with accurate and timely
information management. On the one hand this will cause an important increase
in the amount of recycled waste, neighbors will benefit from them because

</div>","At allGreenup, we seek to change the relationship of people and taking care of the environment, and we do this by encouraging them to recognize and improve their impact on the planet with a entertaining and easy-to-use Mobile App that rewards users..allGreenup provides a unique experience while jogging,
bicycling, recycling, carpooling and reading green tips. With the simple action
of just recording them in the app, you win green points that can be exchanged
for prizes and discounts in the application.Behind the idea of ​​giving benefits to people we intend to
create a virtuous circle where everyone wins. First the planet and app users,
and then brands with a sustainable spirit and small businesses of local
commerce. It is they who, through a network of associated businesses, offer
their products and services with no associated cost, seeking to position
themselves and grow with new audiences.The story begins with the arrival of KOEE to Chile. When meeting with the Luongo cousins, ​​Andrew and Sebastian, the young and enthusiastic koala realized that aside from belonging to different species they had much in common and above all a cause: unite people to take care of the planet.This was how they started working on the idea of ​​allGreenup, which stands for something like ""all who care about the planet stand up and do something for it. Every action counts. "" And two proposals emerged: to integrate technology and encourage people to participate. Shortly after, more people joined the team, which gave more intelligence and vitality. First Sebastián Moreno, who with his programming superpowers gave form to a mobile app which based its development on the feedback from people. Then came Elgueta Fabian, whose unique designer talents, put his abilities to the service of an image that could be close and at the same time very attractive to people.We already had a powerful tool and it looked great, but still lacked spirit. We were missing to transform allGreenup into a community. And it just so happened, by those synchronicities of life, that Javiera Luongo had just finished university and joined this initiative with the goal of creating a network of brands and associated commerce. A circle of sustainable entrepreneurs. And what about the users? And the people? To create a community linked to the cause, Jaime Spinoza joined who used the glue of good intentions and actions of all and called for people to join. All this happened in less than 8 months and since this chance encounter between a koala and two humans, we have managed to create a community of more than 10,000 active users and more than 12,000 followers on social media. Mainly in Chile, but growing rapidly in Argentina and Mexico. Every day more people join, who not only live in the world but also enjoy and take care of it. Individuals who believe that from their personal space can create a collective transformation. People like us who truly believe that every action counts.What is our next step? Expand our cause and bring more people to join our community.
allGreenup focuses not only on a limited and green audience.
It starts from there strengthening  good
habits, but also seeks to spread to those who have not yet developed a
sustainable lifestyle awareness. For them offers benefits such as free movie
tickets, ski tickets or tickets to concerts, among others. And since we
understand that many people take care of the planet without wanting to receive
anything in return, app users can donate their points to institutions working
for the environment. For example, we currently have available the possibility
of planting a tree together with the Chilean foundation “Reforestemos la
Patagonia” in the allGreenup forest located in the southern part of Chile.

We have a
big dream! We want to change the world, we want the world to understand that
each of their actions matter! That is why we will implement allGreenup in
Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Peru and the rest of the region. For this
we need to articular relationships with communities, governments and businesses
in each of these places, in addition to further developing our application,
adding new features such as a new ways of sharing your car and measuring your
physical activity .... besides being able to improve the current performance
also ensuring the scalability we must have.
And to
fulfill our promise we are dedicated to provide incentives to those who make
this change in attitude, giving them rewards for doing so.
Even in
countries where recycling is not developed, we will generate a platform where
recyclers can freely perform residential collection with accurate and timely
information management. On the one hand this will cause an important increase
in the amount of recycled waste, neighbors will benefit from them because
allgreenup will reward them for doing so and eventually to close the circle, we
will give the possibility of recyclers to improve their working conditions and
income.               Con allGreenup, buscamos cambiar la relación de las personas con el cuidado del medio ambiente, y lo hacemos incentivándolas a reconocer y mejorar su impacto sobre el planeta con una App Móvil entretenida y de fácil uso que las premia.allGreenup brinda una experiencia única a la hora de salir a correr, andar en bicicleta, reciclar, compartir el auto y leer tips ecológicos, ya que con tan solo registrarlas en la app, se acumulan puntos verdes que pueden canjearse por premios y descuentos en la aplicación.Detrás de la idea de entregar beneficios a las personas nos proponemos crear un circulo virtuoso donde todos ganemos. En primer lugar el planeta y los usuarios de la app, y luego las marcas ligadas a un espíritu sustentable y pequeñas tiendas de comercio local. Son ellos los que, a través de una red de comercio asociado, ofrecen sus productos y servicios sin costo asociado, buscando posicionarse y crecer dentro de nuevos públicos.La historia se inicia con la llegada de Koee a Chile. El joven y entusiasta koala al encontrarse con los primos Luongo: Andrés y Sebastián, se dió cuenta de que independiente a pertenecer a especies distintas tenían mucho en común y sobre todo una causa: unir a la gente en torno a cuidar el planeta.Fue así como se pusieron a trabajar sobre la idea de allGreenup, que quiere decir algo parecido a “todos los que les importe el planeta pónganse de pie y hagan algo por él. Cada acción cuenta”. Y surgieron dos propuestas: Integrar la tecnología e incentivar a las personas a participar. Al poco andar se sumaron más personas al equipo, quienes le darían más inteligencia y vitalidad.

<p>Using it, roughly is the same as using the conventional rods, except that the body's functioning is ensured by a spring made of stainless steel. We can use interchangeable springs with different mechanical properties depending on the casting weights and the method we use. The spring pole arcs at the same time serve as a line leading ring.</p>

<p>By using the spring-poles the rod length is radically reduced, this allows you to also go fishing in places where it's not possible to use a longer rod. For example on a bank with dense vegetation, or on a sailing boat where there is no room for our long rod.</p>

<p><b>Compact:</b> A compact fishing rod - in its field - has the same tasks as a multi-tool, or as a Swiss army knife: to be multifunctional, small and durable. It is certain that most of the tools available in the world are much better suited for the job, than the fold-out tools from the multi-tool. We can choose nowadays between millions of special fishing rods. Most of them are better suited to the fishing style, for what they have been designed for, than their compact companion. Therefore, never expect from a compact device to be the best in any category. However, there are circumstances and locations where it is doing better than a conventional device.</p>

<p>The 6 kinds of different flexible spring pole, corresponds to 6 different fishing rod. The mechanical properties are shaped by 3 factors: the diameter of the material they're made of, number of spring-arc bends and the length. All of them can be inserted into the grip into two slots, this way we can use upper and lower positions reel too.</p>

<p>We designed it in a way that we can enclose the spring-arcs with a rubber ring, minimizing the chances of folding of the line. Using the rubber ring is not a prerequisite for an effective operation, but it's recommended in some cases - depending on the fishing method, the line, the reel, and the casting weight.</p>
<p> </p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1447719780/q3btsp7l6kkgtxllihbd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p> </p>
<p><b>In the lower position:</b> The best operation can be reached with ""underspin / triggerspin"" reels. Fixed spool (spinning) reels: The smaller the diameter of the spool, the more uniform the winding of the line will be.</p>
<p><b>In the upper position: </b>You can use the poles without compromises, whether it's a spin cast or a bait cast reel we're speaking of. When we're casting it or winding it up, the line will spin around steadily with bigger reels too, but here it's advisable to use a smaller one.</p>
<p><b>Casting distance:</b> The short size of the device allows you to cast not only from above but also from the side or bottom. Moving our wrist, we can increase significantly the impetus of the throw. The spring - like a catapult - launches the bait. The casting distance - depending on casting weight - is competing the 2m long traditional rods.</p>
<p>The compact-modular system best suited variations are sold in form of ""Packs"":</p>

<p><b>How is this fishing rod different from other compact fishing rods?</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Many have asked what the difference is between the commercially available compact fishing rods and the system I have designed. The most significant difference is the REMOVABLE TRIGGER. None of the previously known compact rods had this solution, therefore they can only be used for either casting or spinning methods/reels completely. This is no longer a problem. We do not need to buy further rods again and again. The same spring can be used in both the upper and lower positions. All components of the system can be fit together with the other components. This is what makes this compact rod modular.</p>
<p><b>What are the optimal casting/lure weights?</b></p>
<p>The usage of spring fishing rods is very similar to that of traditional rods on the face of it but the mechanical features of steel springs is are of very different nature that those of the classic fishing rod. Therefore it’s difficult to compare it to the normal fishing standard or insert it into this structure. Lure weight of the springs based on our experience:</p>

</div></div>","Fishing for Everyone! Our product is a compact, modular fishing rod (Pat.Pend). Imagine being able to travel anywhere in the world with it, and you don't have to worry about damaging or breaking it. 
You can swap parts according to what method are you using and what fish are you trying to catch. The minimum size of the smallest version for transportation has only 25cm (10in), you can put it even in your pocket. 

Thanks to the removable trigger, you can equip it with all the existing reel types. It weights only 220-240g - depending on the type of spring pole and the handle.

Stainless steel spring poles, CNC machined – sea water-resistant 6061 T6 – aluminum reel seat, hardwood handles. No plastics. The result is a truly unbreakable fishing rod, which is made for several decades.

  
 
Using it, roughly is the same as using the conventional rods, except that the body's functioning is ensured by a spring made of stainless steel. We can use interchangeable springs with different mechanical properties depending on the casting weights and the method we use. The spring pole arcs at the same time serve as a line leading ring.
 
 
By using the spring-poles the rod length is radically reduced, this allows you to also go fishing in places where it's not possible to use a longer rod. For example on a bank with dense vegetation, or on a sailing boat where there is no room for our long rod.
 
 
the system: CNC-machined reel seat with removable trigger

Compact: A compact fishing rod - in its field - has the same tasks as a multi-tool, or as a Swiss army knife: to be multifunctional, small and durable. It is certain that most of the tools available in the world are much better suited for the job, than the fold-out tools from the multi-tool. We can choose nowadays between millions of special fishing rods. Most of them are better suited to the fishing style, for what they have been designed for, than their compact companion. Therefore, never expect from a compact device to be the best in any category. However, there are circumstances and locations where it is doing better than a conventional device.
 

Modular: All components of the system can be fit together with the other components. With this feature, this is the world's single modular fishing rod. The completed package can be extended with additional spring-poles and grips. 
Its central element it's an aluminum made reel seat - with CNC machining, from which the trigger can be pulled down, making it suitable to receive lower positioned reels besides upper positioned ones.

 
 
The 6 kinds of different flexible spring pole, corresponds to 6 different fishing rod. The mechanical properties are shaped by 3 factors: the diameter of the material they're made of, number of spring-arc bends and the length. All of them can be inserted into the grip into two slots, this way we can use upper and lower positions reel too.

SensorPoles (L=360mm, d=3.0mm):

UltraLight:_______________________________________8-coil SensorPole (d:3.0)
Light:___________________________________________ 4-coil SensorPole (d:3.0) 

PowerPoles (L=360mm, d=3.5mm):

Medium:_________________________________________8-coil PowerPole (d:3.5)
Heavy:___________________________________________6-coil PowerPole (d:3.5)
ExtraHeavy:______________________________________4-coil PowerPole (d:3.5)

NanoPole (L=250mm, d=3.0mm):
Short:___________________________________________6-coil SensorPole (d:3.0)
We designed it in a way that we can enclose the spring-arcs with a rubber ring, minimizing the chances of folding of the line. Using the rubber ring is not a prerequisite for an effective operation, but it's recommended in some cases - depending on the fishing method, the line, the reel, and the casting weight.
 
 
In the lower position: The best operation can be reached with ""underspin / triggerspin"" reels. Fixed spool (spinning) reels: The smaller the diameter of the spool, the more uniform the winding of the line will be.
In the upper position: You can use the poles without compromises, whether it's a spin cast or a bait cast reel we're speaking of. When we're casting it or winding it up, the line will spin around steadily with bigger reels too, but here it's advisable to use a smaller one.
Casting distance: The short size of the device allows you to cast not only from above but also from the side or bottom. Moving our wrist, we can increase significantly the impetus of the throw. The spring - like a catapult - launches the bait. The casting distance - depending on casting weight - is competing the 2m long traditional rods.
The compact-modular system best suited variations are sold in form of ""Packs"":
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 example: usage with bait cast reel
 

 

This package would be primarily configured for top position, and for both open and closed face reels, e.g.: ""Bait cast"" and ""level wind"" reels and ""spin cast” reels. The trigger can be removed from the axis. Without it, we can fish with a lower-positioned reels and a low spring.
When assembled, its length is 60cm/24in. In this package, the MEDIUM PowerPole consisting of 8 arcs is the most sensitive yet powerful spring. Strong, yet sensitive, it's suitable for a versatile use.

 
This package would be primarily configured for low position, and for both open and closed face reels. When assembled, its length is 60cm/24in. The wooden handle is mounted with a long threaded rod, which - secured with lock nut - can be accordingly sized depending on what balance the rod needs. Comes with MEDIUM PowerPole consisting of 8 arcs.
 
 
 
 
 
                              example: usage with - fixed spool - spinning reel
 
 
This package - as its name says - have been compiled with the need to minimize its assembled (48cm/19in) and transportation (25cm/10in) size. Because of its short wooden handle, it's especially suitable for lowercase reels (fixed spool and underspin types), but it can be equipped with uppercase bait casts, raft or ice reels. The package comes with a short spring pole. The short wooden handle is mounted with a long threaded rod, which - secured with lock nut - can be accordingly sized depending on what balance the rod needs. Fully extended, in length it reaches the Spinning grip's length, making it well suited for long spring-poles.

Can't
find the tool when you need it most?We rely on all kinds of tools to make our lives more
convenient. We keep them in tool boxes, drawers, garages, storage areas, or
just randomly around the house. We often cannot find the right tool when we
need it most, especially if it is one that we do not regularly use. Formosa
Treasure (FT) and iThinking are bringing you solutions to this all-too-common
problem.We want to bring you tools that are not only sturdy and practicable, but also modern and fun.In fact, we are designing frequently-used tools in such a way that can also serve as decorative items and therefore always easy to find. The iThinking design team is bringing you not just ordinary tools, but creatively and thoughtfully designed ones that are convenient, accessible, and aesthetically pleasing.After more than an year of hard work, we are very excited to present to you: Huku6 types of commonly used screwdriver heads all hidden within Huku’s body
Huku Design Concept(Hopefully you can tell by now :) Huku is designed in the shape of an owl.  Huku is similar to “Fukurou”, which is the Japanese name for owl.  Huku has a stylish and slick appearance, yet it is extremely functional. The body is a screwdriver set with a magnetic head, containing enough space to include 6 different types of frequently-used screwdriver bits.  Huku can be a piece of unique desktop decor, or can be readily portable.In addition, we have tailored our designs for customers who may want even more. We have two advanced models of Huku: one includes a flashlight while the other includes an extension bar with 2 extra bits to enhance usability.Materials and Construction

All parts of the Huku are expertly selected.  The body of Huku is made of polypropylene(PP), which makes it tough and sturdy. The surface of Huku is coated with thermoplastic rubber (TPR), which makes it comfortable to grip and easy to twist.  The screwdriver bar contained in the Huku is made of chrome vanadium steel (Cr-V), and the screwdriver bits are made of S2 steel with a silvering finish.



We entrust the manufacturing of Huku to KING TONY, an internationally-known Taiwanese brand that has been specializing in quality professional tools for over 26 years.


More details about the 3 Model types, Color options and Packaging:

1. Huku basic with 6 vibrant color options






Just turn the bottom portion of Huku --> select and remove the bit you need --> latch the bit onto the magnetic tip of the Huku screwdriver



2. Huku with Branch (Flashlight) and 3 elegant color choices











The circular area on top of the tree branch-shaped flashlight is magnetic; it can be used to attach to Huku.

3. Huku with Trunk (with Extension bar and 2 extra bits) and 3 elegant color choices







Pick up Huku --> Push down the extension bar and remove it from the bottom of the tree trunk; the trunk can store a total of 8 bits in addition to the extension bar
Now…The Perks!
**New**  We are now shipping to the EU! (Please add $15 to help us cover the shipping cost)



Project Timeline

We are fully committed to manufacture and deploy Huku in the US.  In fact, we are already in final design/testing stage, parts and molds are being procured, packaging boxes are being printed, and will go into first production on the week of 10/16.  We are also doing our very best to have Huku delivered to you before Christmas if everything goes as planned!

Washing hands are extremely important after touching shared surfaces but when you don't have an immediate access to wash your hands, CleanTouch EDC can reduce the point-of-contact area and keep your hands clean!CleanTouch is machined from antimicrobial brass to stop germ growth! Researchers have discovered that copper and alloys made of it, including brass, can prevent antibiotic resistance in bacteria from spreading. CleanTouch is manufactured individually by CNC machine so we can produce it with the beautiful curves and angles.  

Instant Access With FREE Accessories 
Each TouchClean EDC comes with a retractable carabiner, quick release magnetic rings and 10pcs of stylus pen silicone tips.
Clean Touch Is Great For:Touchscreens, buttons, door handles, locks, ATM machines and it also works as a can & box opener! 
 
 
 Instant Access With FREE Accessories Each TouchClean EDC comes with a retractable carabiner, quick release magnetic rings and 10pcs of stylus pen silicone tips. Use the stylus pen feature with the silicone tip or without it! Available In Brass and Anodized Aluminum CleanTouch is available in two different alloys; brass and anodized aluminum. If you prefer your EDC in black color then anodized aluminum is a great option however microbes/viruses live longer on aluminum than brass. Please note:We want to make this clear that we are not offering our reward(CleanTouch) as a medical device. CleanTouch is an every carry item and it is not a medical protection device therefore we can not make any claims to its ability prevent the spread of any microbes and viruses.CleanTouch is a multi-tool that can be used as a box opener, flat screw driver, scraper, stylus and also it may keep your hands clean on dirty surfaces such as door handles and locks however If you prefer to use CleanTouch in public spaces, we would still recommend wiping it down and washing it with soap after each use.Compact & Practical Design
 Why Brass?Brass has been used for thousands of years for sterilization.  The Environmental Protection Agency has registered copper, brass and bronze as antimicrobial and is allowing public health claims to be made about their effectiveness against Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, E. coli O157:H7, Enterobacter aerogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Copper alloys are a supplement to existing infection control practices and are not a replacement for good hygiene and surface disinfection. (copper.org) On copper surfaces, bacteria and viruses die. When a microbe lands on a copper surface, the copper releases ions, which are electrically charged particles. Those copper ions blast through the outer membranes and destroy the whole cell, including the DNA or RNA inside. Because their DNA and RNA are destroyed, it also means a bacteria or virus can’t mutate and become resistant to the copper, or pass on genes (like for antibiotic resistance) to other microbes.""

"">The Modus is the ultimate ""choose your own adventure"" tent, with so many functions and uses.  Let's break down all its features.   
 
We start with the Modus base.  It integrates a self-inflating air mattress and pillow, as well as a zip-on quilt.  Why a zip-on quilt?  When you sleep on a traditional sleeping bag, you are crushing the very fibers that are supposed to be insulating you, making them useless.  The foam and air inside the air mattress are giving you more insulation than you would ever get from the bottom of your sleeping bag, so why have it? And the base is waterproof. 
Add the inflatable poles and bug mesh and you have yourself a breezy summer tent. The bug mesh zips straight onto the air mattress giving you 100% coverage from the creepy crawlies.  The inflatable poles are lightweight, pump up in a flash, and attach to the base with Velcro so it's nice and secure.   
 Need more protection from the elements?  Simply add the flysheet.  But this is not just any flysheet, this is a Crua flysheet. So it's tough, waterproof, reversible and reflective to help regulate your temperature in hot or cold weather. Reflect heat away from the tent during the summer, and reflect heat back in during colder days. Now that you have your reflective flysheet paired up with your insulated air-mattress and quilt, your breezy summer tent is now a full-blown insulated one person tent!
 
  In true 'multi-functionality', your flysheet quickly converts to a hammock, allowing you to relax and swing in the trees. Add the multi-functional porch poles as spreader bars to the hammock or leave them off for the true cocoon 'hammocking' experience. Chill out on your comfy air-mattress, but did you know that your quilt can also be your picnic blanket?  One side is super soft to keep you warm and cozy, the other side is tough and waterproof to keep you warm and dry. Protect the base of your tent and your 'hangout' porch area with the durable and waterproof footprint.  
We all know that camping isn't just about sleeping.  Whether you're hiking, kayaking, biking or just relaxing in nature, what do you do when you stop?  Sit on a rock?  Not any more.  With Modus, you have loads of lounging options for your downtime. Want to keep off the chilly evening breeze or there a threat of some rain?  Add the flysheet and poles over the Modus base and you have yourself a covered porch. But what if you don't want to sit on the ground?  Remember, your flysheet is a hammock!  
 Turn your single tent porch into a shared outdoor lounge space.  It's like having your own 'bona-fide' fort!  Who doesn't love a fort? Simply connect the two porches at poles and use the waterproof Velcro to keep them sealed up together.   The extra flysheet can be added for total coverage.  Simply place it on and peg it down to protect yourselves from the elements or just get a bit of privacy.    Meet a few friends on the trail?  Then just set up camp and enjoy the great outdoors!

<p><strong>Memo Extraction</strong></p>

<p><strong>40+ Languages &amp; 90+ Accents</strong></p>
<p>We will add more languages on top of the already amazing 36! They are Persian, Icelandic, Ukrainian, Urdu, etc. 9 more accents will be available by the time we ship in September in September! And connect you to 200 million more people!</p>
<p><strong>Global Chat</strong></p>
<p>Zero now goes beyond just face-to-face conversation - thanks to all your amazing support we managed to unlock the Global Chat; where you can chat with anyone across the world in any language you choose! </p>
<p><strong>Offline Mode</strong></p>
<p>No matter if you are on a plane; travel without internet connection on your phone; or maybe just the network isn’t working correctly - Zero will keep you safe and secure from all the hassles, and utilize every bit of Zero anywhere, both latitude and longitude!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">40+ languages &amp; 90+ accents</h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">ALL around the world</h2>
<p>It’s become more and more apparent that no company – no matter how large – can optimize the recognition or translation of every single language. So instead of reinventing the wheel, we spent our days and our nights on finding which algorithms work the best for specific languages and only integrating those into our app. What did we get as a result? A service that always outperforms every single-engine translation app or hardware out there.</p>

START FROM ZERO
 
Zero was designed to smash language barriers and to end those embarrassing moments. It drastically outperforms existing handheld translators and apps both in price and in user experience.
We hate to rest on our laurels, so we made the Zero both mobile and versatile. It’s a smart mic that’s always at hand for your next business meeting, interview, or to hear yourself practice the language you want to learn. 
 
 
 


 
Ultra-small and super portable
At a diminutive 4cm x 1.5cm x 7mm (1.6 x 0.6 x 0.3 inches), Zero is barely there. Slip it into a streamlined card case, and you can fit it into pockets, wallets or purses for maximum accessibility

Natural and easy
face-to-face communication
Top-notch translation technology has never been so accessible. The Zero works together with the other device you carry everywhere: your phone.

Just plug the Zero in and let it take care of the rest.
 
No need to charge it separately or fiddle with buttons. The Zero knows who is speaking and reads aloud what they say in the other person’s language. And just in case, the text appears on both sides of the screen to help clear up any potential misunderstandings.
Enjoy all the little things that make conversations great, like eye contact and smiles.

Advanced voice recognition technology offers performance so sophisticated and powerful that the Zero is second to none in noisy environments. Zero picks up your sentences and recognizes your voice much more clearly and accurately than any other handheld device or smartphone.

0 buttons necessary with the Zero, not even 1! 
Besides, we have also developed a neural network algorithm that enables the Zero to understand when you start talking and when you stop. No more ‘Hey Siri’ or ‘OK Google’.
And last but not least, we made the Zero able to do speech pickup in four directions, allowing up to four people to chat simultaneously. In the past, this was only possible on much larger products, such as smart speakers, but we managed to make it 95% smaller and lighter!

What we've created is a bag that can flow from photography shoots to commutes, from the airport to interstellar travel effortlessly, all while being ridiculously good looking and standing up to the inevitable beating we dish out along the way.Designed to be everything you need in a bag, and nothing more.Custom molded back panel and cushioned, breathable shoulder straps for maximum comfortAvailable in any color you want... as long as it's black.With the PRVKE Pack you get the removable cube system, two accessory straps, and a camera sling. With the WORKS, you get all of that plus the WANDRD Pouch.When we set out our goal wasn’t just to make a great photography and travel bag. We wanted to encourage others to stop focusing on the monotony of daily live and to really live.A great bag does more than carry your stuff. A great bag evokes action and facilitates adventure, all while being so intuitive, you forget it's even there.VersatileWe get it. Your life is in constant motion and your carrying needs are ever changing. Your life isn't stagnant and your bag shouldn't be either. Whether you are heading to a photo shoot, traveling across the globe, or commuting to work, the PRVKE pack was designed to adapt to your lifestyle.The removable foam cube and internal bag divider make it easy to seamlessly organize your gear in a customizable way that makes the most sense for you.The cube is designed to fit a DSLR body and up to 8 lenses – or any similar combination of cameras, lenses, accessories, and gear you can think of.Not taking your camera? Remove or change the layout of the dividers and use the cube to organize your clothes, toiletries, etc. when you travel. Easily unpack your clothes by removing the packed cube and use your PRVKE pack as a day bag.With the cube out, you can leave the bag's internal divider up so you have two separate compartments for more organized packing......or fold the divider down so you can fit bigger items such as textbooks, sketchpads, or jazz instruments. Magnetic Tote HandlesMagnetic tote handles make it easy to carry the bag when getting on and off of trains, buses, or planes.The magnetics tote handles are strong enough to hold together when you need them to, but quickly pull apart when you need to access your gear.Trifold Laptop Sleeve The tri-fold laptop sleeve will adjust to fit your 13""–17"" (up to 11""x16"" dimensions) laptop snugly, so you don't have to worry about it moving around in your bag.Our laptop sleeve adjusts to fit the size of your laptop. Oh, and no need to take it out when going through security. The sleeve is FAA approved so just open the clam shell, put it through the scanner, and be on your way.Adjust the tri-fold system to your laptop once, then easily slide your laptop in and out forever more.A set of our versatile accessory straps are included with every bag, and they're here to make your life easier. You can also order an extra pair of accessory straps with your pack by adding $12 to your pledge amount. And yes, they are also black.Attach the accessory straps to the bottom of the bag to carry a tripod, blanket, beach towel, puppy, or anything else you need to bring along.You can also use the accessory straps to latch all sorts of crap to the front of the bag.The accessory straps also hook to the inside of the clamshell so you can use the bag like a tray. No need to fumble with two lenses, four lens caps, and a camera body when changing lenses. You can also use it to sell peanuts at a baseball game.Every bag also comes with a removable waist strap to help carry the load when you need it......and easily take it off and keep that minimal look when you don't.Incredibly AccessibleThere's nothing more frustrating than needing your camera, a book, a pen, headphones, etc., out of your bag, and it taking 5 minutes to do so. Great design is seamless, intuitive, and accessible, so all of your gear is at your fingertips.Clamshell OpeningLay flat packing makes all of your gear accessible when you need it – and this is just one of the main access points on the PRVKE Pack.Each compartment zips closed so everything stays in place and looks super clean. Mesh lining for the upper pocket, so you can see your gear when closed. Lining for the camera compartment to keep dust out, even when the clamshell is open. Roll TopThe roll top gives you quick access to your bag without opening the clam shell.It also allows you to expand and contract the bag depending on how much gear you are packing. Side AccessThe side pocket gives you quick access to your camera or whatever else you may be carrying, without taking off the pack. And works seamlessly with the removable foam cube.Side camera access view from clamshell opening.Top PocketFleece lined top pocket for those items you need most accessible. Secure Documents PocketThe secure documents pocket is built into the molded back panel so you have a safe place for your passport and cash. Good luck to the thieves who try and pick this pocket while your pack is on.Front Pocket The front pocket is a catch all – great for magazines, documents, cords, and the WANDRD Pouch. Side PocketThe side pocket unzips and expands to accommodate a travel size tripod or water bottle. When not in use, the pocket zips flat in adherence with the minimalist style.Easily fits both large and small water bottles.We hate neck straps – they are uncomfortable and always seem to get in the way. So we designed a camera sling that integrates with the PRVKE Pack to make your camera easy to carry and accessible so you never miss a shot. The best part – it's included with every pack!The camera sling gives you quick access to your camera when you need it...fits cameras of all sizes, by attaching to the tripod mount screw...and is much more comfortable than a neck strap.
The side camera sling is made with high-quality webbing and locking clips so your camera is secure.Unlike with a neck strap, your camera won't bounce around as you walk with the side camera sling. Lens Cap HolderElastic lens cap holder on right shoulder strap easily catches most lens cap sizes. SD Card/Battery PocketElastic pockets on left shoulder strap for SD cards and smaller batteries – so you are always ready. SexyLet's be honest, most camera and travel bags are like cargo pants, they're functional, but you lose all dignity wearing them (sorry dad). When we set out to make the PRVKE pack, we knew that it had to look incredible. Sleek and minimal urban design so that you feel good wherever you are. Bomb ProofEach material in the pack has been carefully chosen for its performance characteristics as well as aesthetic quality. We're perfectionists and obsessed over every detail – both in looks and function.Custom molded, oversized buckle for ease of access and distinct style.Tarpaulin and Nylon Dobby are weather resistant and extremely durable to ensure your gear stays safe from the elements. The seams of the bag aren't completely waterproof, but you certainly won't have to worry about a little rain.Yes, there really was camera gear in the bag. But please remember that this bag is not waterproof, just highly water resistant.We've included a rainfly with dedicated storage – so you're ready for those torrential downpours.The rainfly is fitted to the pack, but leaves enough room for the accessories you have strapped to the outside of bag to fit under there as well.The rainfly tucks away into its own bottom pocket so you are always ready for any weather.It also straps around the back, so you can ride your motorcycle without fear of it ripping off in the wind. YKK ZippersYKK zippers are the industry standard for a reason. The documents and side camera pocket also have a zipper garage to keep you comfortable and your gear safe.
 PhotographersTravelersCommutersCreatorsExplorers This bag is for the adventurous, and molds to any situation they find themselves in.
Because sometimes you need a little more organization for your cords, pocket sized Tabasco, chapstick, small electronics, and throwing knives. The WANDRD Pouch is just as sexy and bombproof as the PRVKE Pack, because it's made out of the same high-quality tarpaulin and YKK zippers. Internal and external pocket to organize gear.Fleece lined to snuggle your valuables.It was designed to fit perfectly inside the front pocket of the PRVKE Pack, but of course you can use it anywhere.PRVKE Pack Features:

<p>The DANVER BAG certainly stands for many details, but first we want to explain about the quality of its components because we believe it is always the key feature when we talk about a bag. We made the bag with 600D polyester or with PU because they are more <b>durable</b> and <b>lighter</b> materials at the same time. We used the most durable nylon handles and nylon padded shoulder strap, and we chose the strongest wires for the seams. In <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">particular </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">D-ring </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">holders </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">have </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">been </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">reinforced </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">precisely </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">to </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">avoid </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">breakage </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">in </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">point </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">where </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">bag </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">undergoes </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">more </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">efforts</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">.

Coming to the zippers, fundamental for the success of a good bag, we chose them carefully for their practicality but also for their consistence. Quality zippers are very expensive, consider that </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">DANVER </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">BAG </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">has </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">a </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">total </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">length </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">zip </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">up </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">to </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">430 </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">cm</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> (</span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">169""</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">).</span></p>

<p></p>
<p>Now you understand why the DANVER BAG has a U-zip opening for easy access to the main compartment where you can carry your clothes, shoes and travel necessities. You also have one interior zipped net pocket and two interior velcro pockets to better organize your stuff. It offers also two outside zipped pockets and two big round side pockets to quickly access to your essentials, such as business cards, smartphone, passport, wallet and travel tickets. </p>
<p>Your necessities should be separated and accessible. For the everyday traveler, organization is a must. You will never have to rummage through the bottom of a bag again.</p>

</div><p>As already said, we want each of you can distinguish and we also want each of you can choose the DANVER BAG to suit your needs. For this reason we have created 5 sizes and 5 patterns, to guarantee the maximum choice!

We want Danver Bag not to only be used for its functionality, but to match your personal style and be perfect for any occasion.

It rapresents a unique sport and travel bag with its stylish design and highly-functional features. This is the fitness and daily travel packable bag that finally meets the needs of the modern and active lifestyle. The market for highly-functional and attractive athletic/travel bags is non-existent. DANVER is a brand that aims to fill this much needed space in the fitness and travel industry.
With DANVER BAG we want to give wide importance to sports and travel bag, we do not want to consider the bag only a necessity, an accessory, but we want to make it stylish, the protagonist of your style, cared in the design and in every detail, we want you to be the first to be proud to show to all your friends this fantastic every day companion. We want you to feel just cool!





   




The DANVER BAG certainly stands for many details, but first we want to explain about the quality of its components because we believe it is always the key feature when we talk about a bag. We made the bag with 600D polyester or with PU because they are more durable and lighter materials at the same time. We used the most durable nylon handles and nylon padded shoulder strap, and we chose the strongest wires for the seams. In particular D-ring holders have been reinforced precisely to avoid breakage in the point where the bag undergoes more efforts. The interior of the bag is fullylined. Coming to the zippers, fundamental for the success of a good bag, we chose them carefully for their practicality but also for their consistence. Quality zippers are very expensive, consider that DANVER BAG has a total length zip up to 430 cm (169"").


Now you understand why the DANVER BAG has a U-zip opening for easy access to the main compartment where you can carry your clothes, shoes and travel necessities. You also have one interior zipped net pocket and two interior velcro pockets to better organize your stuff. It offers also two outside zipped pockets and two big round side pockets to quickly access to your essentials, such as business cards, smartphone, passport, wallet and travel tickets. 
Your necessities should be separated and accessible. For the everyday traveler, organization is a must. You will never have to rummage through the bottom of a bag again.


And here is the strong point of DANVER BAG! How many times have you emptied the bag coming home from a workout session and then you got it in the way? Or how many times have you bought a bag during a trip because you had not a chance to take it with you because of luggage ever closer? Or how many times has increased considerably the volume of your luggage and you were in difficulty to carry the stuff in excess during the journey back home?

From now on, these problems no longer exist because your DANVER BAG can be reducedup to 80% with the zippered cutback system we devised (patent pending). So you can easily put it in a drawer, or you can take with you in your luggage.

Our team spent countless grueling hours, coming up with a duffel bag that is able to accommodate your everyday lifestyle.

As already said, we want each of you can distinguish and we also want each of you can choose the DANVER BAG to suit your needs. For this reason we have created 5 sizes and 5 patterns, to guarantee the maximum choice! After assigning colors to the side pockets that identify the capacity of the bags, we chose different patterns for the central body that create original and unique bags.Here the 5 different sizes:
20 Liters - ø 25 cm x L 44 cm / ø 9,84"" x L 17,32"" 
30 Liters - ø 28 cm x L 50 cm / ø 11,02"" x L 19,68""

60 Liters - ø 34 cm x L 66 cm / ø 13,39"" x L 25,98""
All bags are 15 cm lengthy when they are shortened.Once you've chosen the right size for your needs, you can choose the pattern of the central body:

After the first prototype phase, with our economic potential we were able to finance the first trips to professional and reliable supplier, visit important exhibitions and pay countless samples. We also managed to buy 200 bags with our strength and we were able to sell them on the road with a red Ape Car in a single month.To enable our dream realized, we need your support. We guarantee the will to fight and we assure you that we will not waste even an euro that will be given to why we are here to finance our dream!Danver is so close to becoming a reality and we just need your help in funding the first round of main production.

<p>We’ve come to INDIEGOGO to share our idea with you and the awesome community of bikers and bike commuters around the world. We want to learn from you, and with your support, we will get this product to market that much faster.</p>
<p>Our design for the helmet is almost ready for tooling and mass production, and the app is in development, but only your help will get us to the finish line.</p>
<p>We have 15 years experience in developing and manufacturing products and have already brought to market more than 50 products.  For the helmet we have partnered with a top tier manufacturer that works with top brands like (GIRO-BELL, Melon, Specialized) and for the electronics we enlisted a long time supplier to Yamaha and Panasonic. We have a great team and together, we can make this happen.</p>
<p>We’re hoping to raise funds that will be spent on initial tooling for mass production and sourcing of materials.</p>

<p>We are designers and entrepreneurs. We wanted to create a brand that would represent all the beautiful things associated with living in the city. At the same time we wanted to solve a real issue that our cities face; Urban Mobility. That is why we created BROOKLYNESS. Our first product is the “CMYK Folding Electric Bike” designed to bridge the gap between the first and last mile &lt;from home to the subway/train and from there to the office&gt;</p>
</div>
<div>We are not new to crowd funding, actually we did two successful campaigns already. The first was the CMYK 2.0 on KICKSTARTER in 2012 where we delivered the products and had very happy costumers. This helped us to start making the bikes in larger numbers. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Based on customer feedback we made improvements to the bike and in 2015 we launched the CMYK 4.0 on INDIEGOGO, where we are on schedule to deliver the first bikes in August 2016.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In these past years we've learned that Safety is the number one issue why people do not ride bikes in the city on a regular basis. That is why we focused our efforts on addressing safety with our newest product, The CLASSON Helmet. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here are some pictures of this awesome journey and the people that are making it possible. We thank you for being part of this.</div>

</div></div>","Know when cars are approaching, so you can make better decisions on the road.
Cameras (front & back) scan the environment. This info is interpreted by our algorithm and communicated to you, using our visor interface. A non-disruptive light under the visor blinks in your peripheral vision as cars are approaching from behind. Light intensity is adjustable.
 
 

Intuitive Turn Signals: Gesture sensors read your natural movements and activate the turning lights.
Indicate which way you are turning simply by using your hand signals. The sensors read your movement and activate your turning lights on the right or left side. Turn lights are located in the front and back of the helmet, ensuring that you are visible to others.  
 

Brake lights turn on automatically when you reduce speed. 
Let those behind you know your intentions just by doing what you would normally do. The integrated accelerometer detects when you are braking and a red light turns on at the back of the helmet.    
 

Live stream your ride or quickly capture ​and share videos on the fly.
Your ride is automatically recorded. Access the video and edit to make small videos or GIFs to share with friends. ​You could even live stream your commute!
 



 

Set your destination and the CLASSON Helmet ​will guide you there.   
Get step-by-step navigation guidance in the simplest way. ​Our proprietary interface is simple and doesn't require you to take your eyes off the road. Use the Classon App and your phone communicates with the helmet. A series of directional lights under your visor tell you whether to go left, right or straight.  
 

A hole to lock your helmet with your bike.
This lock opening allows you to secure your CLASSON helmet to your bike.

The shell of the Classon Helmet comes in 5 awesome colors so that your helmet can reflect your personality. Orange, blue and yellow also help make you more visible to those around you.  We wanted to have something for everyone, you can get your CLASSON in black or white as well.
We will contact our backers after the campaign to confirm what color you want your CLASSON Helmet to be.

 

Sizing for the CLASSON Helmet starts at Junior (about 12 years and up) and is also available in medium and large. To determine the size of your CLASSON Helmet see the chart below.  To measure your head please use one of the methods below.

Method 1: Wrap a flexible tape measure around your head above your eyebrows and in the middle of your forehead.
Method 2: Wrap a piece of string around your head in the same manner as method 1. Determine length of the string with a ruler.

We will reach out to our backers after the campaign for size information. The CLASSON Helmet will also have an adjuster to make sure your helmet fits properly.
 

 


 

We’ve come to INDIEGOGO to share our idea with you and the awesome community of bikers and bike commuters around the world. We want to learn from you, and with your support, we will get this product to market that much faster.
Our design for the helmet is almost ready for tooling and mass production, and the app is in development, but only your help will get us to the finish line.
We have 15 years experience in developing and manufacturing products and have already brought to market more than 50 products.  For the helmet we have partnered with a top tier manufacturer that works with top brands like (GIRO-BELL, Melon, Specialized) and for the electronics we enlisted a long time supplier to Yamaha and Panasonic. We have a great team and together, we can make this happen.
We’re hoping to raise funds that will be spent on initial tooling for mass production and sourcing of materials.

 

 

We are designers and entrepreneurs. We wanted to create a brand that would represent all the beautiful things associated with living in the city. At the same time we wanted to solve a real issue that our cities face; Urban Mobility. That is why we created BROOKLYNESS. Our first product is the “CMYK Folding Electric Bike” designed to bridge the gap between the first and last mile <from home to the subway/train and from there to the office>

We are not new to crowd funding, actually we did two successful campaigns already. The first was the CMYK 2.0 on KICKSTARTER in 2012 where we delivered the products and had very happy costumers. This helped us to start making the bikes in larger numbers. 
 
Based on customer feedback we made improvements to the bike and in 2015 we launched the CMYK 4.0 on INDIEGOGO, where we are on schedule to deliver the first bikes in August 2016.
 
In these past years we've learned that Safety is the number one issue why people do not ride bikes in the city on a regular basis. That is why we focused our efforts on addressing safety with our newest product, The CLASSON Helmet. 
 
Here are some pictures of this awesome journey and the people that are making it possible. We thank you for being part of this.

THE 3 DIGITS TSA APPROVED PADLOCK IS INCLUDED WITH EACH BAG   Angry Lane meets Pacsafe® The motorcycle heritage of Angry Lane meets the patented technology of Pacsafe®. We first met Phil Hayes, EVP of Product at Pacsafe®, a few years ago when he first moved to Hong Kong. We connected through a mutual love of bikes, surfing and art. We share the same values and entrepreneurial spirit and demand for high quality. With our insights on design from riding experience coupled with Pacsafe’s amazing technology and willingness to try new things, we created these two bags that we are really excited to bring to market. THE RIDER DAYPACK Slim and compact, the Rider Daypack is a light perfect companion for an active lifestyle.
 The MOLLE webbing system allows you to attach a wide range of accessories.   
All webbing straps are securely attached with Velcro to avoid flapping around.     THE HELMET SAFE BAG AND ITS CARRYING POUCH Carrying your helmet around is no fun so with Pacsafe® we have worked on a new design as well as a special waterproof carrying pouch with straps to attach to your motorcycle frame or handlebar.The Helmet Safe Bag features a full eXomesh® 360 locking system with locking device and 3 digits TSA included approved padlock. The sheathed stainless steel cable won’t scratch your helmet, the bag lining is made of 100% Polyester 180grm fleece for full protection and the outer shell is water resistant with a reflective print to protect from outside conditions.       THE RIDER DAYPACK  THE HELMET SAFE BAG AND ITS CARRYING POUCH

THE MINDSET SHIFT....
Once we as a society take the stance that we love and will support our senior citizens, then and only then will we begin to see them take their rightful place in society. V.E.G.A.S. TRANSPORTATION sees an opportunity to accommodate by providing accessible, affordable and professional shuttle van services while
                         VISIBLY ESTABLISHING GIVING AND SERVING.There are so many reasons people will need to utilize our services. My 91 year old grandmother just stopped driving recently, YES, as in a few months ago. Unfortunately, with age comes less ability to get around and more dependence on other people.
Be it physical restrictions, lack of companionship or the inability to find a ride, depression and a sense of helplessness can set in. What if our transportation service could answer the call and provide accommodating transportation that caters to the individual's needs?What if our perks that you receive with your donations HELP IN SPREADING AND DECLARING OUR MESSAGE to the world?

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The
origins of the project date back to the year 2007. Mattia Insolera,
internationally awarded documentary photographer, sailed away from
Italy with a friend who wanted to cross the Atlantic Ocean on a
sailboat. After two weeks of navigation he realised he was more
interested in life on the shore rather than the mere task of sailing.
He dropped down in the Strait of Gibraltar and there he had a first
glimpse of a truly Mediterranean environment, a world inhabited by
seamen and dockers, smugglers and migrants. He decided to devote the
next years of his life to a comprehensive photographic project about
Mediterranean culture. Soon after he moved to Barcelona to be in a
place well connected to its shores. From there he was able to reach
13 Mediterranean countries, traveling on any kind of boat, from
sailing to cargo, and covering 25.000 Km with his motorbike.
Throughout the years the project has been funded by public and
private institutions and showcased in festivals and exhibitions
throughout Europe. The time has come to enclose it in its ultimate
form: a photo book.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Nowadays
most of the people know the Mediterranean for being a paradise of
sea, sun and blue sky. Belonging to this area Mattia felt the urge to
scratch the surface of this touristic cliché and try to capture the
real essence of this space. The Mediterranean of the XXI Century has
become divisive: a barbed wired fence between the North and the South
of the world. It is also the basin where the major conflicts of the
world are taking place, a dangerous passage for those who flee from
misery and war and even a cemetery for 20.000 migrants that sunk in
its waters in the last 20 years. It wasn't always like this. In the
past this inner sea was inclusive: a bridge connecting shores and
different cultures, a fertile soil for the very first civilisations.
According to the Turkish writer known as the Fisherman of
Halikarnassos, it was a <i><b>Sixth
Continent</b></i>, distinct
from the arbitrary five continents of geographers, assimilating
people coming from the antipodes of the earth, turning them into
Mediterraneans. Mattia wanted to find out if something remained of that time so he
focused his camera on people who still use the sea as a surface for
transportation, a working place, an area of exchange, in other words,
people who still experience the sea as a Sixth continent.</p>

del XXI secolo è diventato una frontiera di filo spinato tra il nord
e il sud del mondo. È anche il bacino in cui la maggior parte dei
conflitti si stanno svolgendo, un passaggio pieno di insidie per chi
fugge dalla miseria e dalla guerra, e un cimitero per i 20.000
migranti naufragati nelle sue acque negli ultimi 20 anni. Non è
stato sempre così. Nel passato il mare interno è stato un ponte che
metteva in comunicazione differenti culture,  terreno fertile per la

Mediterráneo del siglo XXI se ha convertido en una valla de
alambre de púas entre el norte y el sur del mundo. También es la
cuenca donde los conflictos principales del mundo están ocurriendo,
un paso peligroso para aquellos que huyen de guerras e incluso un
cementerio para los 20.000 migrantes que hundieron en sus aguas los
últimos 20 años. No siempre ha sido así. En el pasado este mar
interior fue inclusivo: un puente que conectaba costas y diferentes
culturas, una tierra fértil para las primeras civilizaciones. Según
el escritor turco conocido como el Pescador de Halicarnaso, el
Mediterráneo era un Sexto
Continente
distinto de los cinco continentes arbitrarios de los geógrafos, un
espacio que asimilaba gentes procedentes de las antípodas de la
tierra, convertiéndolas en Mediterráneos. Mattia quería averiguar
si quedaba algo de aquellos tiempos, de manera que enfocó su cámara
en las personas que todavía utilizan el mar como superficie de
transporte,  lugar de trabajo, espacio de intercambio, es decir, en
la gente que aun vive la mar como un Sexto Continente.THE

Foreword
by Arianna Rinaldo

This
is going to be a poetic travelog that takes you through a journey
into space and time, a guide for travelers willing to discover the
other side of the Mediterranean. Designed
by de.MO, it will feature quotes taken from a rich literary
tradition, stories and anecdotes from people encountered along the
way and a beautifully hand drawn map. This work appeals to a very
broad audience: those who are keen on maritime culture, social and
environmental issues, anthropological and historical studies. It can
help to understand the past and present of this region and to spread
its message of cultural inclusion, a useful lesson to manage our
troubled times. There are many good reasons to publish this book, but
there's only one way to do it: through your support. If you would
like to back up the project you have a selection of rewards to choose
from, including  posters, shopper bags, signed copies of the book, as
well as limited edition archival prints.
See
gallery below. You can tell Mattia which print you would like to purchase (mattiainsolera@gmail.com)

Questo
sarà un poetico diario di bordo che vi condurrà in un viaggio nello
spazio e nel tempo,
una guida per viaggiatori che vogliono scoprire l'altra faccia del
Mediterraneo. Ne faranno parte citazioni prese da una ricca
tradizione culturale, storie ed aneddoti raccolti lungo il cammino e
una bellissima mappa disegnata a mano. Questo lavoro incontra
l'interesse di una audience molto ampia: gli appassionati di cultura
marittima, coloro a cui interessano le questioni sociali e
ambientali, gli studi storici e antropologici. Può essere utile per
comprendere il passato e il presente di questa regione e per
diffondere un messaggio di inclusione della diversità culturale,
così importante in questo tempo segnato dai conflitti. Ci sono molte
ragioni per pubblicare questo libro, ma c'è un solo modo per far si
che succeda: attraverso il tuo aiuto. Se vuoi contribuire a questo
progetto troverai una serie di ricompense tra cui scegliere: dalle
copie del libro alle stampe fine-art in edizione limitata.

As
with all projects, set-backs occur every now and then. We will do our
best to send the rewards to you at the estimated time, if there are
delays in production I will promptly inform you. If we will not reach
the full amount needed to finalize the project we will utilize the
money toward the printing of the book in a smaller amount of copies 
and we will do the
impossible
to deliver all the rewards. 


Come
in tutti i progetti gli imprevisti possono accadere. Faremo del
nostro meglio per inviare le ricompense nel tempo stabilito, se ci
saranno ritardi nella produzione vi informeremo prontamente. Se non
raggiungeremo l'obbiettivo utilizzeremo il denaro per stampare il
libro in un numero minore di copie e faremo l'impossibile
per inviare tutte le ricompense.

Como
con todos los proyectos, retrocesos ocurren de vez en cuando. Haremos
nuestros mejores esfuerzos para mandaros las recompensas en el tiempo
indicado, si hay alguna demora en producción les informaremos
puntualmente. Si
no alcanzamos el importe total necesario para finalizar el proyecto
utilizaremos el dinero hacia la producción del libro en un menor
número de copias y haremos lo imposible para enviar todas las
recompensas.

It’s perfect for urban dwellers who don’t have a balcony or storage space for a regular grill, as it easily fits in a drawer or closet! And guess what, <b>you don't have to give up functionality for portability.</b> The GoBQ unfolds <i>(as if by magic! )</i> to become a sturdy, fully functional charcoal grill with a lid, and enough grilling space to feed the whole family.

<h2>FAQs</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<b>How do you clean it? </b> Right after cooking and disposing of the coals, the grill can be folded up and transported quickly without a lot of mess. The body folds into the lid which snaps shut and helps prevent ash dust from falling out of the base. Once you're home or at your next destination, the silicone coating on the fabric make it easy to clean... just spray it out with water before storing. For a more thorough cleaning, wash it out further with dish soap (it fits in the sink too!). The bottom ember guard is also removable for easier cleanup of any grease that may have survived the coals.</li>
<li>

<h2>Our History</h2>
<p>It all began in 2002 when Eric Goeken — a budding young architecture student without a car — wanted to tailgate with his buddies before the game. But lugging a bulky, heavy metal grill across campus on foot or by bike was out of the question. And even if… what do you do with the grill when you’re ready to go to the game? An idea was born. Invent a truly <em>mobile</em> grill that folds up, can fit in a backpack, and when you’re done you can just bring it right into the game with you!</p>
<p>Fast forward 12 years, an architecture degree, a patent and a bunch of prototypes later: Today Eric’s a 30-something <i>hipster</i> without a car — but he and his business partner Todd Zaroban have developed his idea into an amazing product that grilling fans are clamoring over… the GoBQ Grill. It’s the ultimate outcome — merging three of their favorite things — friends, food and the outdoors!</p>

<h4>Eric Goeken</h4>
<p>AKA: The man behind the grill – Eric's inventive skills are matched only by his passion for grilling, green architecture and sustainable design. Since he was first allowed to wield a hammer and nails as a young'n, Eric has been building stuff — furniture, robots, you name it. Care to know how to build a graphene supercapacitor? Subscribe to Eric’s YouTube channel, and you might just be lucky enough to find out. If you could care less about graphene supercapacitors, be sure to check out his most ingenious method of cutting a grapefruit.</p>
<p>In his professional life, Eric spent eight years at an architectural firm, where he helped design commercial properties including the Peninsula Players Theater in Door County, Wisconsin, and Regents Hall at St. Olaf College. He hails from Omaha, Nebraska, and has an architecture degree from Iowa State University.</p>
<p>Though Eric has devised a number of brilliant inventions, the GoBQ is his pride and joy — and he can’t wait to share his passion with other grilling enthusiasts.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Todd Zaroban</h4>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Todd is a successful entrepreneur and business owner with over 25 years of design, branding and marketing experience. He keeps Eric in line and focused on one invention at a time, which is no small task.</p>
<p>He’s a proven entrepreneur, having run his own successful graphic design and web development firm for the past 17 years. He has served as brand consultant, web developer and visual communications designer for such major brands as Bayer, McDonalds, Hefty and AstraZeneca.</p>
<p>He too is a grilling junkie, and also smokes the best BBQ pulled pork this side of Saturn. Todd is also from Nebraska, and has a BFA degree from the University of Nebraska at Lincoln. He currently lives in Chicago with his wife Stefany – and has recently celebrated another successful launch, a newborn baby born in January!</p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>There are always possible bumps in the road with any new product development. Maintaining the integrity of the design and high standards of quality in the materials and craftsmanship is important to us, as is staying on schedule so our customers get their GoBQs as soon as possible. </p>
<p>We've worked hard to minimize risks by first designing, creating, testing, using and improving several working prototypes in-house so that any design flaws, however minor, could be identified and solved well ahead of time.</p>
<p>Next we've carefully selected and vetted our manufacturing resources to ensure reliability, quality and scheduling is monitored and maintained throughout the process. Instead of having one factory make our product, we will source to factories that excel for each unique part and then bring everything together to assembly. </p>
<p>Finally, before the first unit ships, we'll personally perform final quality inspections so every GoBQ meets our high standards of quality and performance.</p>
<p>All that said, there's always the possibility for unforeseen delays due to circumstances beyond our control. Inclement weather can affect shipping times. Ports can become backed up with surplus cargo.</p>
<p>But no matter what, we promise to keep you informed with frequent updates on the progress of our project. So check back often to see how everything is going, and thank you again for all your support!</p>

Thank You!>>> UPDATE 6/1/15 <<<THANK YOU THANK YOU!A HUGE thank you to all our fans, contributors and supporters for helping us reach 303% of our goal in 60 days! Not only have you helped launch a company, you've helped revolutionize grilling! Now that our campaign has ended, promotional pricing, stretch goals, referral bonuses, and some perks will no longer be offered. We are, however, continuing to accept pre-orders here until we shift to our own e-commerce platform. The pre-order perk is $149 and includes 1 GoBQ grill + strap.    This is the GoBQ™Now you can grill anywhere you go! Introducing the world’s first and only ultra-portable packable fabric grill. Made from fireproof fabric, the GoBQ folds up like a camping chair and fits in a backpack, a drawer, or slung over your shoulder. It's lightweight and compact. It’s quick and easy to set up and take down. Oh, and it's pretty dang cool too. Ever feel shackled to your backyard, or steps from your car because traditional grills — even the “portable” ones — are just too bulky and heavy to take with you? We did too, but not anymore! The GoBQ Grill can easily be taken to the beach, camping, tailgating, picnicking, biking, boating, hiking, fishing, or anywhere you go! Take it wherever you imagine you could be grilling!  And the high-tech heat and flame resistant fabric cools down soon after dumping the embers so you can quickly pack up and hit the trail to your next destination! Want one this summer? Join the club! We surpassed our $30,000 funding goal in only 6 days and have a head start on producing our first manufacturer samples. Plus we have enough funding to pay for all the upfront tooling and material costs required to manufacture these in volume. AND we've recently reached our first stretch goal of $60,000 so we can provide another color choice (looks like red is winning so far)! PLUS, we extended our campaign through May 30th, so if you want one delivered from our first shipment and be able to""GoBQ"" this summer and in time for tailgating season, claim your perk now. Thank you for your support!    Features and Specifications     Compact for easy packing and storage 
 
 

The GoBQ is so compact there’s really no limit where you can take it. Whether you’re on foot or a bike, in a canoe or an airplane, the GoBQ folds up to the size of a small duffel bag. It’s perfect for urban dwellers who don’t have a balcony or storage space for a regular grill, as it easily fits in a drawer or closet! And guess what, you don't have to give up functionality for portability. The GoBQ unfolds (as if by magic! ) to become a sturdy, fully functional charcoal grill with a lid, and enough grilling space to feed the whole family. Forget about all those other so-called ""portable grills""!
 

High-Tech Heat/FlameResistant Fabric

 
 

Made from heavy-duty silicone-coated fiberglass fabric that can withstand temperatures over 1200ºF (648º C), the GoBQ can take the heat! This material is  FDA-compliant for cookware, and is commonly used for baking mats and oven conveyor belts. It cools down much faster than metal, and insulates the heat so the outside stays cooler than the inside, making it safer for kids and clumsy cooks!

FAQs


How do you clean it?  Right after cooking and disposing of the coals, the grill can be folded up and transported quickly without a lot of mess. The body folds into the lid which snaps shut and helps prevent ash dust from falling out of the base. Once you're home or at your next destination, the silicone coating on the fabric make it easy to clean... just spray it out with water before storing. For a more thorough cleaning, wash it out further with dish soap (it fits in the sink too!). The bottom ember guard is also removable for easier cleanup of any grease that may have survived the coals.

What kind of charcoal can you use? We recommend any kind of match-light or quick-light briquette because you don't have to carry lighting fluid. Some brands offer small individual sized 3lb bags that you can ignite with a match (such as the  ""Kingsford BBQ Bag""). Briquettes are also easier to arrange and rearrange in the basket (using metal tongs of course) if you like to get picky with your heat distribution.

Why not just use one of those campfire grates? We've tried those rickety contraptions too and got too frustrated finding the perfect positioning and/or fishing food out of the ashes. Cooking over an open campfire is great for marshmallows or a hotdog on a stick, but it's nearly impossible to control the heat enough to properly cook much else.

<h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
<p>Diapers2Go is the brainchild of two dads trying to do away with a problem all parents face. Founders Scott and Thomas met as neighbors while their kids played together in the same street. Their conversations soon turned from the joys of fatherhood to the stresses of being a parent, with both realizing it was diapers which topped the list of headaches</p>
<p>It is easy to see why: there are so many elements to the job, with the entire is process undone without one of the key ingredients. Scott knew there had to be a better way. After some thinking and tinkering in his suburban garage in Australia, Scott created an all-in-one solution: a single biodegradable package which included all the necessities. Needless to say, Thomas was impressed. The dads teamed up to patent, trademark and bring the product to parents of the world. Scott and Thomas, a cement truck driver from New Zealand and a film producer hailing from Denmark, may seem like an unlikely pairing but are perfectly poised to deliver their solution to the masses. Thomas has previously run almost 30 crowdfunding campaigns for film production, and the pair hopes they can get production started with enough pre-orders and online support.</p>

<p>Many travel adaptors on the market are designed with single-use fuses to protect electronics from power surges and overloads, but replacing them and lugging spares around can be a hassle. To combat this annoyance, Zendure launched Passport in 2017, which was the world’s first travel adaptor with an auto-resetting fuse. Thanks to its revolutionary innovation and beautiful industrial design, it won the Good Design Award by the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design.     </p>
<div data-id=""21988182""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1534794309/enab7jhxcvjv6zejbemb.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>To continue leading the way in the industry and provide an even better user experience, Zendure dedicated over a year to the Passport upgrade project. This led to the creation of Passport Pro, the world’s first grounded travel adaptor with a push-button resetting fuse.   </p>
<div data-id=""22028519""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1534794309/opolmtclzwybxs53deln.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<p>In the 2017 version Passport with the auto-resetting fuse, you'd have to wait a minute for the adaptor to recover itself if there’s an overload. With the new one-push resetting fuse, when the current flow exceeds safety levels, the power will be interrupted automatically, and with just one push of the fuse button, Passport Pro can be reset immediately. There’s no need to wait, much less carry spares with you, or rush out to buy replacement fuses.  </p>

<p>It’s the first time that a resettable circuit breaker has been introduced into a travel adaptor. Why has no other product been able to do this? Because traditional circuit breakers are too big and too expensive for travel adaptors.   </p>
<div data-id=""21989626""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1534794312/zlbxe22v0letdzk83gg6.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>In order to find the perfect circuit breaker that’s small enough to fit into Passport Pro, we partnered with a manufacturer from Taiwan to co-develop a solution. This manufacturer has been in the circuit breaker business since 1991. With over 27 years of experience in this field, they were able to manufacture the world’s smallest and most robust circuit breaker for us. This was a key component that enabled us to make Passport Pro so compact.  </p>
<div data-id=""21912761""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1534794312/b85oi5k9u30tdufnorfa.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>A top priority in electrical safety is keeping electricity grounded. Passport Pro has four plugs and each is equipped with a ground connection. A ground wire is an essential safety feature for many electrical systems. In the event of high voltage, short, or irregular electrical currents, the grounding wire provides a path for the electricity, transferring energy to the ground rather than the electrical system. This keeps you and your devices safe, reducing the risk of electrical shock, fires and, other dangers.     </p>
<div data-id=""21912765""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1534794313/avbifwoa3yvja2ardl2n.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>The ground wire plays such an important role, but surprisingly 99% of travel adaptors on the market do not have a ground connection. So far, only a few brands in the world can manufacture grounded travel adaptors due to the complexity of the design, and Zendure is proud to announce Passport Pro as one of them. Now you can use your beloved electronic devices with peace of mind. </p>

<p>Zendure always keeps safety a priority and ensures safer compatibility for consumers worldwide. Passport Pro is compliant with national and international regulations and standards. It is the first travel adaptor which achieves both IEC60884-2-5 Certification and BS8546 Certification. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is the world’s leading organization for the preparation and publication of International Standards for all electrical, electronic and, related technologies. With the increasing complexity of plug and socket designs by different countries worldwide and in order to provide standardization for safe usage, the IEC published the latest version of its standard for plugs and socket in 2017- IEC60884-2-5. The document also applies to travel adaptors with limited scope.   </p>

<p>BS8546 is a British Standard introduced specifically for travel adaptors launched in April 2016, and it is now a regulation set in the UK to protect the user from unsafe travel adaptors. In fact, it’s the world’s first national safety standard for travel adaptors, and many more countries will follow. It’s also the most rigid standard for travel adaptors and has laid out stringent specifications for safety and quality.   </p>

</div></div>","Many travel adaptors on the market are designed with single-use fuses to protect electronics from power surges and overloads, but replacing them and lugging spares around can be a hassle. To combat this annoyance, Zendure launched Passport in 2017, which was the world’s first travel adaptor with an auto-resetting fuse. Thanks to its revolutionary innovation and beautiful industrial design, it won the Good Design Award by the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design.     

To continue leading the way in the industry and provide an even better user experience, Zendure dedicated over a year to the Passport upgrade project. This led to the creation of Passport Pro, the world’s first grounded travel adaptor with a push-button resetting fuse.   


In the 2017 version Passport with the auto-resetting fuse, you'd have to wait a minute for the adaptor to recover itself if there’s an overload. With the new one-push resetting fuse, when the current flow exceeds safety levels, the power will be interrupted automatically, and with just one push of the fuse button, Passport Pro can be reset immediately. There’s no need to wait, much less carry spares with you, or rush out to buy replacement fuses.  

It’s the first time that a resettable circuit breaker has been introduced into a travel adaptor. Why has no other product been able to do this? Because traditional circuit breakers are too big and too expensive for travel adaptors.   

In order to find the perfect circuit breaker that’s small enough to fit into Passport Pro, we partnered with a manufacturer from Taiwan to co-develop a solution. This manufacturer has been in the circuit breaker business since 1991. With over 27 years of experience in this field, they were able to manufacture the world’s smallest and most robust circuit breaker for us. This was a key component that enabled us to make Passport Pro so compact.  

A top priority in electrical safety is keeping electricity grounded. Passport Pro has four plugs and each is equipped with a ground connection. A ground wire is an essential safety feature for many electrical systems. In the event of high voltage, short, or irregular electrical currents, the grounding wire provides a path for the electricity, transferring energy to the ground rather than the electrical system. This keeps you and your devices safe, reducing the risk of electrical shock, fires and, other dangers.     

The ground wire plays such an important role, but surprisingly 99% of travel adaptors on the market do not have a ground connection. So far, only a few brands in the world can manufacture grounded travel adaptors due to the complexity of the design, and Zendure is proud to announce Passport Pro as one of them. Now you can use your beloved electronic devices with peace of mind. 


Zendure always keeps safety a priority and ensures safer compatibility for consumers worldwide. Passport Pro is compliant with national and international regulations and standards. It is the first travel adaptor which achieves both IEC60884-2-5 Certification and BS8546 Certification. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is the world’s leading organization for the preparation and publication of International Standards for all electrical, electronic and, related technologies. With the increasing complexity of plug and socket designs by different countries worldwide and in order to provide standardization for safe usage, the IEC published the latest version of its standard for plugs and socket in 2017- IEC60884-2-5. The document also applies to travel adaptors with limited scope.   

BS8546 is a British Standard introduced specifically for travel adaptors launched in April 2016, and it is now a regulation set in the UK to protect the user from unsafe travel adaptors. In fact, it’s the world’s first national safety standard for travel adaptors, and many more countries will follow. It’s also the most rigid standard for travel adaptors and has laid out stringent specifications for safety and quality.   

In order to meet the requirements of the above standards, our engineers have done tremendous work to re-design everything from the inside out, from electronic components, to the selection of raw materials, to the sizes of all the parts, and when it finally came together, we had a true game changer.  

Passport Pro features four powerful USB output ports, including one USB-C PD output and three USB-A outputs. Thanks to years of experience and expertise in charging technology, Zendure is the first company to apply industry-leading Power Delivery charging technology into travel adaptors.   

USB Power Delivery will charge your device up to 70% faster than a standard 5W charger and provide more power to charge tablets and laptops quicker. Thanks to its 18W maximum output, it can charge iPhone X, iPhone 8/ 8 Plus up to 50% in just 30 minutes. Passport Pro serves as an excellent travel companion with strong compatibilities. You can use it to power and charge mobile phones, laptops, electric shavers, digital cameras, game consoles, and other electrical items.

Thanks to built-in plugs and the universal AC output, this compact 3-pole travel adaptor can work seamlessly in over 200 countries and regions to power 2- and 3-pole devices from almost all over the world.   

Passport Pro can accept type A, B, C, E, F, G, I, J, L, N and O plugs. This is related to the devices you want to use, or in other words, where you are from. 

Passport Pro can plug into type B, C, D, E, F, G, I, K, and O outlets. This is related to where you want to travel to with Passport Pro. Here’s full list of countries whose outlets are compatible with Passport Pro (more than 200 countries and regions).

there. 
There
is nothing like a great ride in the countryside. The wind in your face, the sun
shining, … just cruising along..
You’re
enjoying your ride so much, you’d want to map it, share with your friends and
ride it again!
That is why we want to create an app that tracks your route. We call it
roadhunter!
It’s
very easy to use. You activate the app on your smartphone at the start of your
bike ride, and… simply forget about it. The app does all the rest. It Tracks in the background so you can listen to music,
take calls, and use any other feature of your phone, while still tracking routes, distance and
average speed.


Roadhunter
automatically shuts down when you take a break for 15 minutes or longer to save
battery power.
And
there’s more! Snapshots you take during the ride will be added to your log.
When you reach your destination, your trip will automatically be uploaded to
and shared with fellow bikers on the Roadhunter community website. 





In
your personal profile you can review and download the gps data of your trip and
share your biking experience with your friends. 
And
if you are looking for some inspiration for your next trip or holiday, the Roadhunter
website offers you trip suggestions. All routes can be downloaded for your Garmin or TomTom.


We
are thrilled about the idea. To create an app and matching community for bikers
to share their best trips with each other, to point out that hidden treasure
along the road, to inspire to make more trips.
So
this is what we want to do. We want to create a useful app for bikers and a community
website to back it up.
To be
able to do this, we need funding. That’s where you come in. You can help us
reach the amount of 30,000 euro we need for the development. Every donation
is welcome, but the bigger your donation, the faster we can turn this test
model into your favorite travel companion.. Have a great ride !",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span>Introducing the Vizibelt - a light with huge surface area that wraps around your body or backpack to make sure you get seen. Whether a cyclist, runner or anything else, you will become far more visible to those around you at night. It not only makes you more visible, it looks great too so you'll be turning heads for all the right reasons!</span></p>
<p><span><span>Vizibelt uses just two LEDs (one at each end) and a thin tube of flexible plastic to create a long, very bright and light weight light. The final touch is a bright PVC covering in Green, Orange or Blue that adds even better colour and visibility. Using just two LED lights combined with the innovative plastic light-carrying tube means battery life is still competitive with smaller, less eye-catching alternatives like under-seat rear LED bike lights. Vizibelt has three light modes; fast flash, normal flash and constant light.</span></span></p>

<p>Both models are under 120g (0.26 lbs) each including batteries, so you hardly feel the Vizibelt while in use. Batteries used are 2 x CR2032 button batteries - inexpensive and easy to replace.</p>

<p>My name is Will Williams, I'm a 22 year-old Australian and I now run  a small but growing sourcing and logistics services company here in Shenzhen, China (founded in Hong Kong in mid-2011) called Capstone Pacific (<a href=""http://www.cap-pac.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cap-pac.com</a>). Before this, I had 5 years experience in sourcing from China remotely, importing and then selling online in both Australia and the UK. I now work on the ground at Chinese factories on a daily basis to source, manufacture, quality control and then deliver products around the world for small-medium business clients who import from China. This places myself and my team in the perfect position to work face-to-face with the selected Vizibelt factory - a short drive from us. You can be assured we have the expertise to keep to our time and quality promises as Chinese manufacturing assistance and logistics is what we do! </p>
<p>My LinkedIn profile: cn.linkedin.com/in/wdtwilliams</p>
<h2>How can you help?</h2>
<p><span>The goal is to raise $7000 to do the first decent sized production run, to hopefully make Vizibelts available to customers around the world. By pledging for one of the Perks packages offered, you will not only be one of the first people in the world to receive a Vizibelt, though you will have directly contributed to bringing a product to market that can be of real use.</span></p>
<p>Each supporter will also receive a unique Vizibelt souvenir (not yet finalised) to show that their contribution enabled Vizibelt to launch.</p>
<h3>Delivery Timeline:</h3>
<p>Production is ready to commence and at the latest this will be at the end of October (units would start shipping to you all by late November). If there is good interest early on in the Indiegogo campaign, production should be able to start earlier!</p>
<p>Shipping times for regular international postage from Hong Kong are 7-21 days for most destinations around the world. If you select Express Courier for $15 extra (or for free on some packages), you will receive the delivery within 3-5 days of being sent from our facility here in China! The Express Courier option means you can be assured of delivery no later than 7th December, and possibly by late November.</p>
<p>Ordering of components/materials will start in good time to assure that we experience no delays to the delivery plans. This is one of the advantages of being on the ground in China, we will keep a very close eye on everything and eliminate problems before they cause delays.</p>

<p>Nepal has been rocked this year by extreme weather events,
causing the tragic loss of many lives. 
One of those events was a massive landslide in early August.  156 villagers were killed and now over 600
are homeless and living in a tent city, having lost everything.  The weather will soon start to get very cold in
this area and the temperature overnight will be 10 degrees below zero.  We want to provide large, warm blankets for
these people and a warm jacket for each child. 
These families really need our help.</p>
<p>Our organisation is based in Kathmandu and has a team in
Nepal and Australia.  We’ve been working
with hospitals, orphanages and Women’s centres for two years and 100% of all the
money we raise goes to Nepal.  We’ve
previously provided blankets for an orphanage in Kathmandu and the children were
so excited to have warm, soft blankets that they still proudly show off to
visitors.</p>
<p>We have already been to the landslide area in September and
provided 1000lb (500kg) rice, 200lb (100kg) dahl and 100lb (50kg) of clothes
and shoes for the villagers.  We are
worried now about the cold weather.  </p>
<p>There is also an area to the west of Kathmandu called the
Terai that is subject to severe cold weather during the winter that can be
deadly.  This area is low and flat and
during summer it’s incredibly hot.  Much
of the population lives in poverty and they don’t have the clothes or shelter
to protect them.  When the cold wave comes
with winter and is prolonged it causes many deaths.  We want to give warm jackets to the children
to help protect them from dying from cold.</p>
<p>A life saving blanket costs US$15 and we want to buy at
least 300 and a warm jacket for a child is around US$5 so we hope to buy 500.  The more money we raise the more blankets we
can buy and we’ll use whatever money is raised, even if we don’t reach our
goal.</p>

<p>The San Francisco Yellow Bike Project is a grassroots, pop-up, do-it-yourself,
community-building machine that brings dead bikes back to life and puts more city
dwellers on two wheels. We’ve had our lives changed by bicycles, and we want to
share that passion with others. Our main objective is to get bikes into the hands of
community members who need them for day-to-day life. The average cost of a new
bike can often be double the list price, something many people can’t afford. Even the cost of bicycle repair can often be more than the value of the bicycle itself. We
empower people through education, allowing them to get their bikes back in rideable
condition at the fraction of a bike shop’s repair cost, with the knowledge of repair for
the future. </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
 






The San Francisco Yellow Bike Project is a grassroots, pop-up, do-it-yourself,
community-building machine that brings dead bikes back to life and puts more city
dwellers on two wheels. We’ve had our lives changed by bicycles, and we want to
share that passion with others. Our main objective is to get bikes into the hands of
community members who need them for day-to-day life. The average cost of a new
bike can often be double the list price, something many people can’t afford. Even the cost of bicycle repair can often be more than the value of the bicycle itself. We
empower people through education, allowing them to get their bikes back in rideable
condition at the fraction of a bike shop’s repair cost, with the knowledge of repair for
the future. 




Yellow Bike offers a range of activities and services for the community, including:



Build a Bike workshops where we teach people how to build and repair bikes


Open shop hours where people can buy bikes at lower prices than retail


Courses in basic safety and urban cycling skills


Community outreach where we build bikes and deliver them to schools and parks


Recycling & refurbishing bike parts, making them easily accessible


Special projects with local organizations


What We Need 
We love what we do and we want to do even more, including:





Prepare the front of the shop for retail sales, fixtures, hooks & bike storage
Keep the shop open a wider range of days and hours for easier accessibility
Buy initial inventory to stabilize our finances and help to better serve our community
Acquire more volunteers and generate community awareness

We'd also like to aid the city of San Francisco in their goal to have 20% bicycle transportation road share by 2020. 
..... But, as we mentioned, our MOST IMPORTANT GOAL OF ALL is to get bikes to as many people as possible and help the city of San Francisco become a bigger cycling community!

It is the worlds simplest, smallest and smartest barbecue accessory!</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/3LjpXfrVMvY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><div>
<p>Imagine one of the following familiar situations: you and your best friend decide to indulge in a spontaneous beer-and-grill session at a nearby park. Alternately, you are taking your kids to the woods for an adventurous bonfire with many treats to barbecue. Or you are simply on a hiking trip, wanting to prepare a grilled meal over the flames of your campfire.</p>
<p>Up to now all of these situations were a huge drain on logistics and preparation, or ended up in poor results, right? Imagine the inconvenience of packing your bulky Weber Grill and the barbecue utensils, or a fire pit and bag of charcoal, or a stinky disposable grill pack.  Even roasting your food on a stick over the open flames is difficult! In that case, you must definitely have encountered one of these infamous three problems: you stick catches on fire, your food drops into the campfire, or splinters from the stick end up in your freshly barbequed food.</p>
<p> </p>

It’s fabricated of stainless steel (V2A 1.4301), crafted with love and incredible detail, for a high-quality product. When treated with care, the foldable FORQ design can be reused many times. Simply clean your FORQ with pure water, or place it in the dishwasher and use it again. You can even fold the FORQ back into its original flat design, and put it back to work a dozen times before the material wears out.</p><h2> </h2><h2>THE FORQ ON TV</h2><p>The FORQ was tested by German television station Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) in the show ""Einfach Genial"" from Mai 30st 2917.

Imagine one of the following familiar situations: you and your best friend decide to indulge in a spontaneous beer-and-grill session at a nearby park. Alternately, you are taking your kids to the woods for an adventurous bonfire with many treats to barbecue. Or you are simply on a hiking trip, wanting to prepare a grilled meal over the flames of your campfire.
Up to now all of these situations were a huge drain on logistics and preparation, or ended up in poor results, right? Imagine the inconvenience of packing your bulky Weber Grill and the barbecue utensils, or a fire pit and bag of charcoal, or a stinky disposable grill pack.  Even roasting your food on a stick over the open flames is difficult! In that case, you must definitely have encountered one of these infamous three problems: you stick catches on fire, your food drops into the campfire, or splinters from the stick end up in your freshly barbequed food.
 
 THE FORQSIMPLE, SMALL, SMARTFORQ is your simple, small, and smart solution to enjoying bonfire barbecues spontaneously and safely. Reduced to the max! With two integrated functions, it is a laser cut, stainless steel design, and with barely the size of a credit card, it fits into any wallet or pocket. USE IT to OPEN BOTTLES, and within 10 seconds easily fold it into a BARBECUE SKEWER! It helps prepare your food safely and hygienically, on the tip of any stick! FOR ANY MEAT & VEGAN BARBECUEThe FORQ is equipped with a stainless steel barbed skewer tip that holds vegetables just as securely as sausages and steaks. LIFE TIME & CAREThe ’FORQ’ is made with German High Tech engineering and manufacturing quality. It’s fabricated of stainless steel (V2A 1.4301), crafted with love and incredible detail, for a high-quality product. When treated with care, the foldable FORQ design can be reused many times. Simply clean your FORQ with pure water, or place it in the dishwasher and use it again. You can even fold the FORQ back into its original flat design, and put it back to work a dozen times before the material wears out. THE FORQ ON TVThe FORQ was tested by German television station Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) in the show ""Einfach Genial"" from Mai 30st 2917. Replay the episode about THE FORQ here! PRODUCTION & DELIVERYYou may be surprised, but the FORQ is already a ""ready to ship"" product. We are capable of immediately sending out the first 1000 samples from our direct stock. For high volume orders of up to 100.000 pieces, we can ship within 4 weeks after the order has been placed. WHO IS BEHIND THE FORQThe FORQ was invented, designed and developed by Martin Finkbeiner and Wolfgang Heisel from the lovely state of Baden-Wuerttemberg in Southern Germany. Martin and Wolfgang then teamed up with serial entrepreneur Jens Thieme. Jens is the business mind behind the well-known Indiegogo and Kickstarter crowdfunding successes Scrooser and The Swiss Protection Sock. WHY CROWDFUNDING ON INDIEGOGO?We love the FORQ, and we love CROWDFUNDING on Indiegogo. The FORQ is an innovative and great quality product that is ready to ship. All we need is for you to find out and learn more about it. What better way to discover new innovative products than on Indiegogo? With your help and backing, we will introduce the FORQ to a much broader audience. With your order on Indiegogo, we will reduce production costs, produce your FORQ, and spread the word for all to see! LOVE, SHARE & BACK FORQ!The timing has never been better! Barbecue season has just started, and your high-quality FORQ is ready to ship! We offer you perks of a great value, that beat every in-store price tag. LOVE the FORQ, SHARE this project , and BACK your FORQ NOW!",2.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></h3>
<ul><li>Is the stiffness adjustable?</li></ul>
<p>Absolutely - We designed the ShockStop Seatpost so that you can adjust it to perfectly match your weight and riding style. Before your order ships, we’ll send out a BackerKit Survey to collect information about your order. In that survey, you’ll select a specific spring installation based on your body weight (don’t worry, we’ll provide plenty of guidance). The selected spring will be come pre-installed in the seatpost. Next, you’ll use the preload adjustment knob at the bottom of the seatpost to adjust the spring preload - the amount of force required to cause the saddle to start moving. Together, the stiffness and preload allow you to dial in the feel to your exact preference.</p>
<ul><li>Will the spring need to be replaced?</li></ul>
<p>No, the spring is designed to last the lifetime of the seatpost. We’ve tested the performance of the springs extensively and selected the geometry and material of the spring specifically to withstand the rigors of daily riding without degradation.</p>
<ul><li>How many springs do I get?</li></ul>
<p>The seatpost ships with one spring of your choice. Before your order ships, we’ll send out a survey to collect information about your order. In that survey, you’ll select a specific spring installation based on your body weight (don’t worry, we’ll provide plenty of guidance). The selected spring will be come pre-installed in the seatpost. If, in the future, you decide that you want to try a different stiffness spring, we will have other spring stiffnesses available for purchase at a substantial discount for backers.</p>
<ul><li>What is the minimum installation height?</li></ul>
<p>The ShockStop Seatpost requires at least 90mm from the top of the seat tube collar (the part on your bike that holds the seatpost in place) to the center of the saddle rail in the saddle clamp.</p>
<ul><li>What is the warranty?</li></ul>
<p>We stand behind every product that we sell, and we pride ourselves on the quality of our products, as well as the support that we provide to our customers. Redshift Sports warrants that all of our products are free from defects in material and workmanship for two years from the date of original retail purchase.</p>
<ul><li>How is the product tested?</li></ul>
<p>The seatpost is tested to the latest ISO 4210 standard for Racing &amp; Mountain Bicycles. These standards typically specify ""Static Strength"" tests (i.e. one-time application of force) as well as ""Fatigue"" tests (i.e. repeated application of force) for different bicycle components. <br/>We also run our own independent tests to better understand lifespan which typically involve cycling well beyond the specifications in the ISO 4210 standard.</p>
<ul><li>How does it hold up to mud and sand? Will you offer a rain/dirt cover?</li></ul>
<p>The internal mechanism uses custom SKF seals to provide a robust barrier to mud, grit and water. They come from the same family of seals that you see on mountain bike front fork suspensions. While we expect these to hold up to heavy off-road usage, this will be a user-serviceable part if the need should arise.</p>
<p>We are confident in the seal design, but we have receive enough questions about a cover that we will consider offering this an add-on option.</p>
<ul></ul>
<ul><li>Will my saddle bag fit with the ShockStop Seatpost?</li></ul>
<p>Most standard strap-based saddle bags will fit the ShockStop Seatpost without issue. If your saddle bag uses rigid clips, clamps, or some other inflexible attachment method, it's possible that your bag may not be compatible.</p>
<ul><li>Do you plan to offer a carbon fiber version?</li></ul>
<p>Currently we do not have plans to release a carbon version. We’re keeping our efforts focused on delivering a fantastic product as soon as possible. If we get enough interest in a carbon version, we will consider adding it to our development roadmap once we’ve fulfilled all orders.</p>
<ul><li>Will this work for bikes with 25.4mm seat tubes like the Cannondale Synapse?</li></ul>
<p>Unfortunately, no, the ShockStop Seatpost will only fit bikes that have seatpost diameters of 27.2mm or larger.</p>
<ul><li>Will this work for aero seatposts/Trek seat mast?</li></ul>
<p>Unfortunately, no, the ShockStop Seatpost only fits standard round seatposts that are 27.2mm or larger in diameter.</p>
<ul><li>Will the seatpost work with 7mm x 9mm carbon saddle rails?</li></ul>
<p>Yes, we will offer a 7mm x 9mm compatible saddle clamp as an add-on option that will be available in BackerKit after the campaign completes.</p>
<ul><li>Is the ShockStop compatible with a Di2 battery BT-DN110?</li></ul>
<p>Yes, the seatpost is compatible with mounting a Di2 battery - we're developing a ShockStop-specific mounting option and that will be offered as an add-on option in BackerKit after the campaign is complete.</p>
<ul><li>Will the ShockStop fit in bikes with seatpost diameters larger than 27.2mm?</li></ul>
<p>Yes! The ShockStop will fit any bike with a seatpost diameter of 27.2mm or larger. We will be offering inexpensive shims as an add-on option in BackerKit after the campaign is complete. Shim sizes include 28.6, 29.8, 30.9, 30.9, 31.6, and 31.8 mm.</p>
<ul><li>Is the ShockStop Seatpost compatible with my folding bike?</li></ul>
<p>The ShockStop Seatpost is 27.2mm in diameter and 350mm long. Typically, folding bikes use very long seatposts in larger diameters. But, many folding bikes come with and can work with telescopic seatposts. These allow you to use a standard seatpost like the ShockStop by adding an extension that fits into the bike and accepts the standard seatpost. Check with you local bike shop or bike manufacturer to see if one of these is available and if it accepts 27.2mm seatposts. An example of one that accepts 27.2mm seatposts is the Tern telescopic seatpost: <a href=""https://www.ternbicycles.com/us/gear/471/telescopic-seatpost"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ternbicycles.com/us/gear/471/telesc...</a></p>
<ul><li>If I order the ShockStop System, when will I get the Stem?</li></ul>
<p>Your ShockStop Stem will ship with the Seatpost. If you’d like to get the ShockStop Stem earlier, we will offer an add-on shipping fee option through BackerKit.</p>
<ul><li>Is there any damping in the System?</li></ul>
<p>Damping is important for MTB because you're trying to absorb larger amplitude impacts. For high-frequency, small amplitude perturbations, it's better to have a very lightly damped system to maximize responsiveness. The plunger seals provide enough damping to prevent unwanted movement of the post, but otherwise, the system is free to respond quickly.</p>
<ul><li>How does international shipping work? Will I be responsible for VAT?</li></ul>
<p>All international rewards will be shipped from the US and will have a declared value of the amount that you pledged, including shipping costs.</p>
<p>We will offer a prepaid option for those who would prefer to pay the taxes &amp; duties up front. The shipping provider charges a fee of €10 for the prepaid VAT service (in addition to the tax and duty amount). We will continue to look for even easier and cheaper options to prepay VAT after the campaign ends. If you don't choose the prepaid service you will be responsible for any taxes, duties, and fees that are due on import.</p></figure></div></div>","The ShockStop Seatpost is an adjustable-stiffness suspension seatpost that will dramatically improve your ride by smoothing out the road.

 The ShockStop has an internal spring which applies force on the seatpost's four-bar linkage, which in turn suspends the saddle and rider. As you ride, the seatpost allows the bike to move under you as it encounters uneven terrain, which reduces the accumulated effects of bumps and vibrations by up to 60%. The four-bar linkage ensures that your saddle angle remains constant through the full travel of the suspension.Using accelerometers in the lab and on the trail, we were able to accurately measure the direction and magnitude of impact forces transmitted to the rider. With that data, we optimized the travel of the ShockStop suspension mechanism to absorb as much of this impact energy as possible while minimizing the influence on the pedal stroke. The suspension mechanism of the ShockStop Seatpost can be precisely tuned to match your riding style. First, a user-selectable in-line coil spring means a wide range of riders can take full advantage of the shock-absorbing benefits.  Then with the right spring in place, the adjustable preload allows fine tuning of the responsiveness without sacrificing any suspension travel.  The ShockStop Seatpost uses advanced manufacturing techniques, such as 3D forging, to integrate the suspension into a sleek design that fits compactly below the saddle. 
Whether you're looking to just take the edge off the cracks in the road, or completely mute the gravel, the ShockStop Seatpost is the perfect solution.L to R: Suntour, BodyFloat, ShockStop, Thudbuster, CG-RWhat makes the ShockStop Seatpost different from other suspension seatposts? The short answer: A Lot! For the long answer, check out this blog post we put together. 
Yes, you can! It takes just a couple minutes and requires only standard bike tools. The ShockStop Seatpost will fit any bike that has a round seatpost 27.2mm in diameter or greater (the vast majority of bikes). If your bike has a seatpost that is larger than 27.2mm in diameter, inexpensive shims can be used to make it fit perfectly.Bikes that have non-round seatposts (some triathlon or aero road bikes) or seatposts smaller than 27.2mm (rare) are not compatible.At 350mm length, the ShockStop can be inserted with as little as 90mm exposed above the seat tube collar, or as much as 275mm exposed.  

The ShockStop System: Full Suspension for Your Rigid BikeWe designed the ShockStop Seatpost to be the perfect complement to the ShockStop Stem. They both take what was previously a rigid connection between the rider and the frame and add just the right amount of compliance without sacrificing control or efficiency. Together, they create a suspension system that will have you cracking a smile and choosing the cobble stone route - just because you can. But as much as we love the stem, we think our backers say it best...
  We're mechanical engineers with a passion for cycling and a tendency to ask ""how could this be better?"" Five years ago, we started Redshift Sports to create innovative products that elegantly address real problems faced by cyclists. With the incredible support of our backers through two crowdfunding campaigns, we've been able to turn our ideas into a sustainable company. Today, there are tens of thousands of riders in over 65 countries riding with Redshift components on their bikes. We have extensive product development and manufacturing experience, and we've built Redshift on a foundation of delivering the highest quality products. We've spent years building strong relationships with key suppliers and manufacturers and have a proven production and fulfillment infrastructure. The best part about our job? We get to ride our bikes whenever we want ... all in the name of research and development.

Frequently Asked Questions:
Is the stiffness adjustable?
Absolutely - We designed the ShockStop Seatpost so that you can adjust it to perfectly match your weight and riding style. Before your order ships, we’ll send out a BackerKit Survey to collect information about your order. In that survey, you’ll select a specific spring installation based on your body weight (don’t worry, we’ll provide plenty of guidance). The selected spring will be come pre-installed in the seatpost. Next, you’ll use the preload adjustment knob at the bottom of the seatpost to adjust the spring preload - the amount of force required to cause the saddle to start moving. Together, the stiffness and preload allow you to dial in the feel to your exact preference.
Will the spring need to be replaced?
No, the spring is designed to last the lifetime of the seatpost. We’ve tested the performance of the springs extensively and selected the geometry and material of the spring specifically to withstand the rigors of daily riding without degradation.
How many springs do I get?
The seatpost ships with one spring of your choice. Before your order ships, we’ll send out a survey to collect information about your order. In that survey, you’ll select a specific spring installation based on your body weight (don’t worry, we’ll provide plenty of guidance). The selected spring will be come pre-installed in the seatpost. If, in the future, you decide that you want to try a different stiffness spring, we will have other spring stiffnesses available for purchase at a substantial discount for backers.
What is the minimum installation height?
The ShockStop Seatpost requires at least 90mm from the top of the seat tube collar (the part on your bike that holds the seatpost in place) to the center of the saddle rail in the saddle clamp.
What is the warranty?
We stand behind every product that we sell, and we pride ourselves on the quality of our products, as well as the support that we provide to our customers. Redshift Sports warrants that all of our products are free from defects in material and workmanship for two years from the date of original retail purchase.
How is the product tested?
The seatpost is tested to the latest ISO 4210 standard for Racing & Mountain Bicycles. These standards typically specify ""Static Strength"" tests (i.e. one-time application of force) as well as ""Fatigue"" tests (i.e. repeated application of force) for different bicycle components. We also run our own independent tests to better understand lifespan which typically involve cycling well beyond the specifications in the ISO 4210 standard.
How does it hold up to mud and sand? Will you offer a rain/dirt cover?
The internal mechanism uses custom SKF seals to provide a robust barrier to mud, grit and water. They come from the same family of seals that you see on mountain bike front fork suspensions. While we expect these to hold up to heavy off-road usage, this will be a user-serviceable part if the need should arise.
We are confident in the seal design, but we have receive enough questions about a cover that we will consider offering this an add-on option.

Will my saddle bag fit with the ShockStop Seatpost?
Most standard strap-based saddle bags will fit the ShockStop Seatpost without issue. If your saddle bag uses rigid clips, clamps, or some other inflexible attachment method, it's possible that your bag may not be compatible.
Do you plan to offer a carbon fiber version?
Currently we do not have plans to release a carbon version. We’re keeping our efforts focused on delivering a fantastic product as soon as possible. If we get enough interest in a carbon version, we will consider adding it to our development roadmap once we’ve fulfilled all orders.
Will this work for bikes with 25.4mm seat tubes like the Cannondale Synapse?
Unfortunately, no, the ShockStop Seatpost will only fit bikes that have seatpost diameters of 27.2mm or larger.
Will this work for aero seatposts/Trek seat mast?
Unfortunately, no, the ShockStop Seatpost only fits standard round seatposts that are 27.2mm or larger in diameter.
Will the seatpost work with 7mm x 9mm carbon saddle rails?
Yes, we will offer a 7mm x 9mm compatible saddle clamp as an add-on option that will be available in BackerKit after the campaign completes.
Is the ShockStop compatible with a Di2 battery BT-DN110?
Yes, the seatpost is compatible with mounting a Di2 battery - we're developing a ShockStop-specific mounting option and that will be offered as an add-on option in BackerKit after the campaign is complete.
Will the ShockStop fit in bikes with seatpost diameters larger than 27.2mm?
Yes! The ShockStop will fit any bike with a seatpost diameter of 27.2mm or larger. We will be offering inexpensive shims as an add-on option in BackerKit after the campaign is complete. Shim sizes include 28.6, 29.8, 30.9, 30.9, 31.6, and 31.8 mm.
Is the ShockStop Seatpost compatible with my folding bike?
The ShockStop Seatpost is 27.2mm in diameter and 350mm long. Typically, folding bikes use very long seatposts in larger diameters. But, many folding bikes come with and can work with telescopic seatposts. These allow you to use a standard seatpost like the ShockStop by adding an extension that fits into the bike and accepts the standard seatpost. Check with you local bike shop or bike manufacturer to see if one of these is available and if it accepts 27.2mm seatposts. An example of one that accepts 27.2mm seatposts is the Tern telescopic seatpost: https://www.ternbicycles.com/us/gear/471/telesc...
If I order the ShockStop System, when will I get the Stem?
Your ShockStop Stem will ship with the Seatpost. If you’d like to get the ShockStop Stem earlier, we will offer an add-on shipping fee option through BackerKit.
Is there any damping in the System?
Damping is important for MTB because you're trying to absorb larger amplitude impacts. For high-frequency, small amplitude perturbations, it's better to have a very lightly damped system to maximize responsiveness. The plunger seals provide enough damping to prevent unwanted movement of the post, but otherwise, the system is free to respond quickly.
How does international shipping work? Will I be responsible for VAT?
All international rewards will be shipped from the US and will have a declared value of the amount that you pledged, including shipping costs.
We will offer a prepaid option for those who would prefer to pay the taxes & duties up front. The shipping provider charges a fee of €10 for the prepaid VAT service (in addition to the tax and duty amount). We will continue to look for even easier and cheaper options to prepay VAT after the campaign ends. If you don't choose the prepaid service you will be responsible for any taxes, duties, and fees that are due on import.",33.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>Storing your luggage away when you aren’t using it can be an uphill battle—especially if you don’t have a lot of space where you’re staying or where you’re living. That is why we’ve designed Barracuda with a collapsible function. The Barracuda will easily transform from its rugged, hard-side state to a collapsed and folded state. Within 10 seconds, you can collapse the Barracuda and slip it under the bed or behind a couch. It’s as quick and easy as folding up and putting away a beach towel.</p>

<p>Life doesn’t stop and start at the convenience of the hustle-and-bustle of airports. When you find yourself with several hours to spare between flights, you may still need to send out that important work e-mail or find a way to keep the kids entertained. All you have to do is pull out the Barracuda’s built-in, height-adjustable tray so you can pop your laptop down in a safe place. Whether you’re still working or you’re kicking back to watch a movie, use the tray to keep your laptop safe and sturdy—and simply fold up the tray into the handle when you no longer need it.</p>

<p>When you find yourself in a hurry to arrive at the gate before takeoff, dragging your luggage along isn’t always easy.

Our ergonomic handle provides elegance and ease to all your airport trips.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>The challenges and risks that are ahead of us as we finalize the development and delivery of Barracuda are related to manufacturing and logistics.</p>
<p>• There may be slight variations in the colors based on our transition from the prototypes used in the photos and video to the final manufactured product. Some color options might not be available if demand for the color is below factory minimum quantities or due to unavailability of material in that color. <br/>• There may be changes to the final dimensions or specifications of some of the parts as we optimize the design for mass production and or adhere to airline carry-on luggage standards. <br/>• There is the possibility that the delivery of the product to our contributors may be delayed due to unforeseen product changes that require additional development or addition to the scope of our manufacturing time line. <br/>• There is the possibility that the delivery of the product to our contributors may be delayed due to unforeseen circumstances in international shipping and logistics. <br/>• Shipments may be subject to import duties and other local taxes. <br/>• Final product specifications might change based on optimization for mass production and partner constraints.</p>

</div>","Introducing Barracuda, a groundbreaking carry-on that combines singular design with unique and practical features, simplifying and upgrading your travel experience to premium class.Important: If you wish to add the location tracking module (GPS) you can do so using this link after you complete you pre-order on Indiegogo. https://shop.trycelery.com/page/barracudalocationtrackingproximitysensing Please use the same email address in both places so we can match the upgrade to the preorder. The color is picked later on via a separate survey email we will send out within a few days of placing the pre-order.We are now shipping. Here's an up-boxing video of the final product.




















Barracuda Carry-on Features:

A uniquely distinctive design.
Ability to be collapsed into fraction of the size for easy storage when not in use.
Built-in Tray big enough to fit a full sized laptop.
A removable* 10,000 mAh battery pack sufficient to charge your iPhone five times over.
A storage bag to keep your Barracuda dust free and allowing you to hang it in any closet.
Ergonomic pivot handle.
Portable Stainless Steel Digital Scale

Proximity sensor and location tracking module (optional add-on for only $50)
Manufactured using highest quality materials like Cordura fabric.

*Many airlines do not allow anything with li-ion batteries to be checked-in, this removable design allows you to remove the battery pack if you need to check-in your Barracuda. Also allows you to use the battery pack while the bag is stowed away. The location tracking module has a different smaller battery that can be checked-in.
**Multiple Patents Pending
NOTE: We will send out an email survey where you will have the opportunity 
to pick the color of your Barracuda. We will also make product 
pictures with the color options available to you before shipment so to help you finalize your color preference.










It’s important to stand out in today’s increasingly competitive marketplace. That’s why we set out to design a one-of-a-kind suitcase to reflect the needs and desires of the individual modern go-getter. Barracuda’s distinctive design comes complete with exclusive benefits included to enhance all your trips to the airport.








We will send out an email survey where you will have the opportunity to pick the color of your Barracuda. We will also include product pictures with the color options so it is easier for you to make your selection.


The Barracuda’s bonus features weren’t included simply to make your luggage stand out amongst the crowd; we’ve added these features to make your travel time easier, smoother, and altogether more convenient.

Weather@Point  doesn't use a battery or internet connection. It is powered by your device's battery and is extremely energy efficient so you don't have to worry about recharging. Works with light port adapter for iPhone users.Weather@Point has four sensors that measure temperature, humidity, UV radiation and atmospheric pressure built into a standard four pole audio jack.These four sensors calculate the data and display that information on the screen of your device.The entire device is encased in durable housing made from  aluminum and titanium. It is built to last! With Weather@Point  you'll have  your own personal weather station that can fit in the palm of your hand! That’s great news if you enjoy outdoor activities like hiking, cycling, hunting or fishing - because you don't need an internet connection to get an accurate weather report. No need to rely on weather forecasts and apps anymore. The fact is that weather stations can be dozens of miles away so their measurements are not always accurate. Weather@Point gives you real time on spot weather measurements . You can read them in your app and easily share on cloud platform.Weather@Point  lets you know the maximum amount of time you should be exposed to the UV rays in the specific weather conditions in your area, helping you avoid sun damage and other serious long term consequences of excessive UV exposure. Enjoy the outdoors with the confidence... It is strongly recommended that you re-measure the UV Index at least every 60 minutes when necessary. Just like in Sci-Fi movies! Light meterWeather@Point  now has a built-in light measuring sensor with added meter options in to our application. Gather information about natural as well as artificial light anytime. Use it to measure and set lights at your home, office, store, lab, factory, greenhouse, etc. This information is also invaluable for photographers and videographers and helps them make perfect images or videos anytime and anywhere. Key-Ring Weather@Point  comes with an opening for a key-ring so you'll always have it close by. WaterproofDid you drop Weather@Point  in water? No worries, Weather@Point is built to last.  We are making a free Weather@Point  App that is compatible with iOS and Android. But that's not all! This would work on iOS and Android as an API, providing the information from Weather@Point.

<h3>How Skrēn was born...</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Deirdre...</p>
<p>An avid cyclist, hiker, Nordic skier, snowboarder and dirt biking newbie.  5 years ago, I realized sunscreen wasn't nearly enough to protect my skin. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581435876/wddiho8pgmmtqsmqmnem.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Working in the skincare industry in the high country of Colorado made me acutely aware of the damage I was doing to my skin. Thanks to all my time on the slopes, my face was being exposed to the sun more than normal.​ I knew this would lead to premature skin aging and put me at a higher risk for skin cancer. <br/>Around the same time, I noticed A LOT of my clients aging prematurely. And even worse, too many of my clients were coming in with skin cancer on their face.<br/>I tried just about every facemask on the market but nothing kept me covered while still allowing me to breathe properly.<br/>It was time to take matters into my own hands. <br/>I knew I wanted a facemask that was:<br/>● Breathable</p>
<p>● Protective</p>
<p>● Comfortable</p>
<p>● And looked good </p>
<p><br/>From there, Skrēn was born!<br/> </p>

PROJECT: ITALIA SEGRETA</b></p>
<p>-
Introduction</p><p><b>Travel into
Italy. Travel for Italy.</b><br/></p>
<p>30 years after the <b>“Viaggio in Italia” by Luigi Ghirri</b>, the peninsula is lacerated for the
consequences of a <b>deep crisis</b> arrived from above. What Italy has become today?
The world is getting used to an image of our country decadent and compassionate and
the economic and political spheres still do not look at the reality of the
country. A country that for its historical,
geographical and human resources <b>could live luxuriantly with a clean, clever and curious tourism</b>. My experience of life outside the Italian borders has
matured gradually a critical and angry spirit at the same time of the “Bel
Paese” for the waste of resources and opportunities.</p>
<p>The last
job assigned to me from the<b> Berlin’s Magazine ST.ART </b>was the “A” that was missing. They
asked me to talk about my roots, what I feel as strong and true with my land.
In the editorial drafts I found a<b> picture of the Coliseum</b>. There started the
reflection that has stretched the way for the creation of a work inspired by
the history and nature of a symbolic place of my story but that surprisingly
fits on the story of Italy. The<b> lake of Turano,</b> the birthplace of my paternal
grandmother, was the symbol of an Italy submerged, from which sprout, views
from the world, only the top of the tower of Pisa, some arc of the Coliseum,
the Mole of Turin.</p>
<p>Coming back
home, this time for 10 days, to increase the material for <b>Thurania project</b> I
went back on the shores of Lake Turano and I realized before I take photographs
what could be the reaction of my colleagues on my return to the studio to see

is a project of traveling through Italy searching the most beautiful and
unknown places, the most interesting stories, the local realities and the
excellence of the territory.<br/></p>
<p>The idea
comes from our way of life: we live and work in Berlin for 4 years while
remaining deeply connected to our homeland.</p>
<p>This new
life has opened up a new perspective with which to look at our country and we
realized how much the knowledge of Italy abroad is limited to the usual and famous
destination like Rome, Venice and Florence.</p>
<p>From all
that was born the idea of showing the world the “Secret Italy” the one of the amazing
landscapes, unknown villages and culinary  and artisanal excellence.</p>
<p>We decided
to tackle this trip knowing that we will encounter a country affected by a deep
economic and social crisis and we want this journey to be a springboard to
relaunch a conscious, cultural and clean tourism.</p>
<p>The trip
itself does not have a set route but only a starting point and a destination:
the two extremes commons of Italy. From Predoi to Lampedusa we will proceed
guided by the case, the flow of events , the stories, the experiences and
encounters that will make along the way.</p>
<p>We established a budget to cover to cover the costs of a 12-16 months travel, the setting up of a mobile
media studio inside a car camper  and for
printing the book ""Italia
Segreta"" Italy Visual Atlas.</p>
<p>With your
contribution you can buy one or more copies of a hard cover book version in high quality photographic edition or in digital format or you can finance part of the project directly  becoming a sponsor or a media partner of “Italia Segreta” project .</p>
<p>During the
journey we will compile a logbook on the blog <a href=""http://www.italiasegreta.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.italiasegreta.com</a> where previews of photos of the beautiful Italian landscapes will be shown and the
interviews and stories of our adventures and encounters will be published.</p>
<p>All
material collected will be processed at the end of the journey in order to create a
documentary film about our experiences.</p><p>We will also develop an interactive app that will allow you
to instantly have access to the large database of contents: places, stories,
accommodation, artisans, farms, restaurants, small excellence businesses, Km 0
producers, places of culinary traditions will be simply and quickly accessible directly on your mobile device.</p><p><br/></p><p>PERKS LIST:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575077/files/20140512155454-15.jpg?1399935294"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575078/files/20140512155501-59.jpg?1399935301"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575079/files/20140512155508-94.jpg?1399935308"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575080/files/20140512155514-169.jpg?1399935314"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575082/files/20140512155520-330.jpg?1399935320"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575097/files/20140512155923-850.jpg?1399935563"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575083/files/20140512155527-350.jpg?1399935327"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575084/files/20140512155536-500.jpg?1399935336"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575086/files/20140512155551-1000.jpg?1399935351"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575087/files/20140512155558-3000.jpg?1399935358"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575088/files/20140512155604-5000.jpg?1399935364"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575089/files/20140512155614-10000.jpg?1399935374"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575093/files/20140512155746-tutta.jpg?1399935466"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><br/><p></p><p>_____________________</p><p><b>ITALIANO</b></p>

<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>-Premessa</b></p>
<p>Viaggio in Italia. <b>Viaggio
per l'Italia</b></p>
<p>A 30 anni dal viaggio di Luigi Ghirri, la penisola è allo
stremo per le conseguenze di una crisi impietosa e piovuta dall’alto. Cos'è
questa nostra Italia? Il mondo si sta abituando ad un'immagine decadente e drammatica del nostro paese e le sfere economico-politiche continuano a non
rivolgere lo sguardo verso la realtà del paese, che per la sua formazione storica, geografica e umana potrebbe
vivere rigogliosamente di un turismo pulito, intelligente, curioso, innamorato.
La mia esperienza di vita fuori dai confini italiani ha fatto maturare pian
piano uno spirito critico verso il belpaese e contemporaneamente una nostalgia
arrabbiata per lo spreco di risorse e di possibilità. L'ultimo lavoro commissionato per la rivista ST.ART di Berlino è stato il LA che mancava. Mi hanno chiesto
di parlare delle mie radici, delle mie origini, di quello che sento come legame forte
e vero con la mia terra. Nelle bozze pre editoriali ho trovato la foto di un Colosseo. Lì
è partita la riflessione che ha aperto la strada alla creazione di un lavoro
ispirato alla storia e alla natura di un luogo simbolo del mio passato ma
sorprendentemente calzante per le sorti dell'Italia: il lago del Turano. La terra
natale della mia nonna paterna, è stato il simbolo dell'Italia sommersa, da cui
spuntano, viste dal mondo, solo la cima della torre di Pisa, qualche arco del Colosseo,
la mole di Torino. Nel rientro in patria stavolta durato 10 giorni
l'illuminazione. Per incrementare il materiale sul lavoro Thurania sono tornato
sulle sponde del lago del Turano e mi sono reso conto prima ancora di scattare
le fotografie quale reazione avrebbero avuto i miei colleghi dello studio al
mio ritorno nel vedere quei paesaggi. Così predetto, così è stato. Luoghi non
famosi, non blasonati, non mete turistiche, erano solo alcune delle migliaia di meraviglie
del nostro paese, e come quasi tutti questi luoghi la scure della depressione
si infrange sui sogni della gente e li devasta.</p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: right;""></h3><p>(Valentino Griscioli) <a href=""http://www.valentinogriscioli.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.valentinogriscioli.com</a></p><br/><p></p>
<p>Cio che ora vogliamo fare è mostrare al mondo le
meraviglie dell'Italia da nord a sud, viaggiando su un camper-studio sulle
strade statali e provinciali, 
incontrando questa Italia, fotografandola e raccontandola con
interviste, fotografie e filmati. Diffonderla in tutto il mondo tramite un blog
giornaliero e creando durante il viaggio un Atlante Visuale d’Italia (digitale e
cartaceo) da editare alla fine del viaggio. 
Quello che intendiamo creare è una scia di contatti, di persone, di
possibile ripresa e un incentivo del turismo man mano che questa onda passerà per
tutto lo stivale, un evento mediatico e un punto di riferimento per l'esplorazione
del nostro paese visto dal resto del mondo. </p><p style=""text-align: right;""><br/></p>
<p><b>-Cosa ci spinge al
viaggio</b></p>
<p>Vivendo da 4 anni fuori dall’Italia abbiamo sviluppato una
visone del paese con occhi più obiettivi e anche un po’ nostalgici. Ora vediamo
l’Italia come abbandonata e non sfruttata, in confronto con i paesi con cui
siamo venuti piú a contatto, la Francia e la Germania in primis. Il nostro
scopo principale è la rivalutazione del territorio. Conoscendo l'immaginario che il
resto del mondo ha nei confronti dell’Italia, non riteniamo necessario dire altro
sul Colosseo o la Torre di Pisa ma abbiamo capito la potenzialità del resto del
territorio italiano, bellissimo, dimenticato, sconosciuto al mondo.</p>
<p><b>-L’idea</b></p>
<p>Viaggio dall’estremo nord geografico d’Italia all’estremo
sud evitando tutte le maggiori città e mete più blasonate per creare un Atlante
Visuale d’Italia inconsueto, nascosto, ma reale e affine alla nostra visione
della vita: civile, corretta, legale, a impatto zero, solidale. Il percorso sarà segnato dal senso libero del
viaggio e dagli incontri che ci porterà il cammino stesso: luoghi, persone,
suggestioni. </p>
<p>Man mano che la storia andrà avanti compileremo un database
di tutta la “scia” di contatti di persone e di aziende che incontreremo lungo
il cammino e che sarà uno dei motori del blog <a href=""http://www.italiasegreta.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.italiasegreta.com</a> che in
gemellaggio con i nostri media-partner promuoverà il turismo responsabile e
culturale nell’Italia più svantaggiata e quasi sempre dimenticata.</p>
<p>Alla fine del viaggio pubblicheremo un libro fotografico in
tre lingue (italiano inglese e tedesco), un grande Atlante dell’Italia Segreta,
con nomi, indirizzi e specialità, corredato dalle nostre interviste, da stralci
del documentario visuale che editeremo alla fine dell’esperienza.</p>
<p>Il Blog rimarrà online ma il sito si trasformerà in un
appoggio alla APP “ItaliaSegreta” che farà da ponte tra tutti i contatti
scoperti e redatti durante il viaggio e garantirà l’accesso, agli utenti, al
database sia come consultazione che operativamente per le prenotazioni alle
strutture e servizi.</p>
<p>L’ App funzionerà con una mappa interattiva per scoprire
tutti i luoghi intorno alla posizione attuale con anteprime di foto e piccoli
filmati o interviste e con la possibilità di prenotare prodotti e servizi
direttamente dalle varie aziende online.</p>

lavoriamo da 4 anni a Berlino pur rimanendo molto legati alla nostra terra di

<p>Questa nuova vita ci ha aperto una prospettiva diversa con

PROJECT: ITALIA SEGRETA
-
IntroductionTravel into
Italy. Travel for Italy.
30 years after the “Viaggio in Italia” by Luigi Ghirri, the peninsula is lacerated for the
consequences of a deep crisis arrived from above. What Italy has become today?
The world is getting used to an image of our country decadent and compassionate and
the economic and political spheres still do not look at the reality of the
country. A country that for its historical,
geographical and human resources could live luxuriantly with a clean, clever and curious tourism. My experience of life outside the Italian borders has
matured gradually a critical and angry spirit at the same time of the “Bel
Paese” for the waste of resources and opportunities.
The last
job assigned to me from the Berlin’s Magazine ST.ART was the “A” that was missing. They
asked me to talk about my roots, what I feel as strong and true with my land.
In the editorial drafts I found a picture of the Coliseum. There started the
reflection that has stretched the way for the creation of a work inspired by
the history and nature of a symbolic place of my story but that surprisingly
fits on the story of Italy. The lake of Turano, the birthplace of my paternal
grandmother, was the symbol of an Italy submerged, from which sprout, views
from the world, only the top of the tower of Pisa, some arc of the Coliseum,
the Mole of Turin.
Coming back
home, this time for 10 days, to increase the material for Thurania project I
went back on the shores of Lake Turano and I realized before I take photographs
what could be the reaction of my colleagues on my return to the studio to see
those landscapes. As predict it was. That places were only not famous, not noble,
not tourist destinations places, there were just some of the thousands wonders of our
country, and like almost of these places, the axe of depression breaking on
people's dreams devasting them.                                                           (Valentino Griscioli) www.valentinogriscioli.com
What we can
do now is to show the world the wonders of Italy from north to south, traveling
on a camper-media-studio on secondary roads, meeting this Secret Italy,
photographing it, telling it with interviews, photographs and films. Spread it around
the world through a daily blog during the trip and creating a Visual Atlas of
Italy (digital and paper in 3 languages) to be edited at the end of the trip. What we want is
to create a trail of contacts, people and places for a possible recovery to the
crisis and as incentive for the eco-tourism. That will be a big media event and
a reference point for the exploration of our country for the rest of world.
- What
drives us to travel?
Living
outside Italy for 4 years we have developed a vision of the country with more
objective eyes and even a little of nostalgia. Now we see to Italy as abandoned
and undeveloped in comparison with countries with whom we came in contact more,
France and Germany in particular. Our main purpose is the revaluation of the territory,
we know what the rest of the world thinks and knows of Italy, it is not
necessary to say more about the Colosseum or the Tower of Pisa, but we realized
the potential of the rest of the Italian territory, beautiful forgotten, unknown
to the world.
-The idea
Journey
from the extreme north to the extreme south of Italy avoiding all major cities
and most noble goals to create a Visual Atlas of Italy, unusual, hidden, but
real, close to our vision of life : civil, fair, legal, zero impact. The path will be
marked by a free sense of traveling and based on the meetings, the places, the people
that will take on the path.
As the
story goes forward we will build a database of all the ""big wave” of
contacts of people and companies that we will meet along the way and that will
be one of the engines of the blog www.italiasegreta.com that in partnership
with our media partner promote responsible tourism and cultural heritage in
Italy in the most disadvantaged and almost always forgotten places.
At the end
of the trip we will publish a photo book guide in three languages ​​(English and
German, Italian), a large Visual Atlas of Italy , with names , addresses and
specialties , accompanied by our interviews and extracts from the documentary
that will edit the end of the journey.The blog
will remain online but the site will become a support for the app  ""Italia Segreta""
that will act as a bridge with all the contacts recorded during
the trip and will provide access to the database to be
consulted and for reservations.
The app
will work with an interactive map to discover all the places around the current
position with previews of photos and small videos or interviews with the
possibility of booking products and services directly from various companies
online.Where is your money going?We established a budget for 1000 printed copies of the book:You can pre-order your copy of the book at the special price of $129 / €94 during this 2 months of crowd funding campaign (the final cover price will be €120) saving €26.If you want to become a technical sponsor of the project please email us at: hello@italiasegreta.comFAQShipping:-Is the shipping included in the price of the Book?A: The shipping is included for the EU zone, for the international shipping please add the €20 perk.-I bought the book but forget to buy/can't pay for the international shipping perk, how can I solve that?A: Don't worry about that, after the crowd-funding campaign is over we will contact back all our supporters and we can arrange for a solution.-I subscribed for a 10 pack can I change the shipping address and what about international shipping?A: Sure! After the crowd-funding campaign is over we will contact back all our supporters before shipping and you can at every time change before we ship the pack.

is a project of traveling through Italy searching the most beautiful and
unknown places, the most interesting stories, the local realities and the
excellence of the territory.
The idea
comes from our way of life: we live and work in Berlin for 4 years while
remaining deeply connected to our homeland.
This new
life has opened up a new perspective with which to look at our country and we
realized how much the knowledge of Italy abroad is limited to the usual and famous
destination like Rome, Venice and Florence.
From all
that was born the idea of showing the world the “Secret Italy” the one of the amazing
landscapes, unknown villages and culinary  and artisanal excellence.
We decided
to tackle this trip knowing that we will encounter a country affected by a deep
economic and social crisis and we want this journey to be a springboard to
relaunch a conscious, cultural and clean tourism.
The trip
itself does not have a set route but only a starting point and a destination:
the two extremes commons of Italy. From Predoi to Lampedusa we will proceed
guided by the case, the flow of events , the stories, the experiences and
encounters that will make along the way.
We established a budget to cover to cover the costs of a 12-16 months travel, the setting up of a mobile
media studio inside a car camper  and for
printing the book ""Italia
Segreta"" Italy Visual Atlas.
With your
contribution you can buy one or more copies of a hard cover book version in high quality photographic edition or in digital format or you can finance part of the project directly  becoming a sponsor or a media partner of “Italia Segreta” project .
During the
journey we will compile a logbook on the blog www.italiasegreta.com where previews of photos of the beautiful Italian landscapes will be shown and the
interviews and stories of our adventures and encounters will be published.
All
material collected will be processed at the end of the journey in order to create a
documentary film about our experiences.We will also develop an interactive app that will allow you
to instantly have access to the large database of contents: places, stories,
accommodation, artisans, farms, restaurants, small excellence businesses, Km 0
producers, places of culinary traditions will be simply and quickly accessible directly on your mobile device.PERKS LIST:_____________________ITALIANO

IL PROGETTO: ITALIA SEGRETA
-Premessa
Viaggio in Italia. Viaggio
per l'Italia
A 30 anni dal viaggio di Luigi Ghirri, la penisola è allo
stremo per le conseguenze di una crisi impietosa e piovuta dall’alto. Cos'è
questa nostra Italia? Il mondo si sta abituando ad un'immagine decadente e drammatica del nostro paese e le sfere economico-politiche continuano a non
rivolgere lo sguardo verso la realtà del paese, che per la sua formazione storica, geografica e umana potrebbe
vivere rigogliosamente di un turismo pulito, intelligente, curioso, innamorato.
La mia esperienza di vita fuori dai confini italiani ha fatto maturare pian
piano uno spirito critico verso il belpaese e contemporaneamente una nostalgia
arrabbiata per lo spreco di risorse e di possibilità. L'ultimo lavoro commissionato per la rivista ST.ART di Berlino è stato il LA che mancava. Mi hanno chiesto
di parlare delle mie radici, delle mie origini, di quello che sento come legame forte
e vero con la mia terra. Nelle bozze pre editoriali ho trovato la foto di un Colosseo. Lì
è partita la riflessione che ha aperto la strada alla creazione di un lavoro
ispirato alla storia e alla natura di un luogo simbolo del mio passato ma
sorprendentemente calzante per le sorti dell'Italia: il lago del Turano. La terra
natale della mia nonna paterna, è stato il simbolo dell'Italia sommersa, da cui
spuntano, viste dal mondo, solo la cima della torre di Pisa, qualche arco del Colosseo,
la mole di Torino. Nel rientro in patria stavolta durato 10 giorni
l'illuminazione. Per incrementare il materiale sul lavoro Thurania sono tornato
sulle sponde del lago del Turano e mi sono reso conto prima ancora di scattare
le fotografie quale reazione avrebbero avuto i miei colleghi dello studio al
mio ritorno nel vedere quei paesaggi. Così predetto, così è stato. Luoghi non
famosi, non blasonati, non mete turistiche, erano solo alcune delle migliaia di meraviglie
del nostro paese, e come quasi tutti questi luoghi la scure della depressione
si infrange sui sogni della gente e li devasta.(Valentino Griscioli) www.valentinogriscioli.com
Cio che ora vogliamo fare è mostrare al mondo le
meraviglie dell'Italia da nord a sud, viaggiando su un camper-studio sulle
strade statali e provinciali, 
incontrando questa Italia, fotografandola e raccontandola con
interviste, fotografie e filmati. Diffonderla in tutto il mondo tramite un blog
giornaliero e creando durante il viaggio un Atlante Visuale d’Italia (digitale e
cartaceo) da editare alla fine del viaggio. 
Quello che intendiamo creare è una scia di contatti, di persone, di
possibile ripresa e un incentivo del turismo man mano che questa onda passerà per
tutto lo stivale, un evento mediatico e un punto di riferimento per l'esplorazione
del nostro paese visto dal resto del mondo. 
-Cosa ci spinge al
viaggio
Vivendo da 4 anni fuori dall’Italia abbiamo sviluppato una
visone del paese con occhi più obiettivi e anche un po’ nostalgici. Ora vediamo
l’Italia come abbandonata e non sfruttata, in confronto con i paesi con cui
siamo venuti piú a contatto, la Francia e la Germania in primis. Il nostro
scopo principale è la rivalutazione del territorio. Conoscendo l'immaginario che il
resto del mondo ha nei confronti dell’Italia, non riteniamo necessario dire altro
sul Colosseo o la Torre di Pisa ma abbiamo capito la potenzialità del resto del
territorio italiano, bellissimo, dimenticato, sconosciuto al mondo.
-L’idea
Viaggio dall’estremo nord geografico d’Italia all’estremo
sud evitando tutte le maggiori città e mete più blasonate per creare un Atlante
Visuale d’Italia inconsueto, nascosto, ma reale e affine alla nostra visione
della vita: civile, corretta, legale, a impatto zero, solidale. Il percorso sarà segnato dal senso libero del
viaggio e dagli incontri che ci porterà il cammino stesso: luoghi, persone,
suggestioni. 
Man mano che la storia andrà avanti compileremo un database
di tutta la “scia” di contatti di persone e di aziende che incontreremo lungo
il cammino e che sarà uno dei motori del blog www.italiasegreta.com che in
gemellaggio con i nostri media-partner promuoverà il turismo responsabile e
culturale nell’Italia più svantaggiata e quasi sempre dimenticata.
Alla fine del viaggio pubblicheremo un libro fotografico in
tre lingue (italiano inglese e tedesco), un grande Atlante dell’Italia Segreta,
con nomi, indirizzi e specialità, corredato dalle nostre interviste, da stralci
del documentario visuale che editeremo alla fine dell’esperienza.
Il Blog rimarrà online ma il sito si trasformerà in un
appoggio alla APP “ItaliaSegreta” che farà da ponte tra tutti i contatti
scoperti e redatti durante il viaggio e garantirà l’accesso, agli utenti, al
database sia come consultazione che operativamente per le prenotazioni alle
strutture e servizi.
L’ App funzionerà con una mappa interattiva per scoprire
tutti i luoghi intorno alla posizione attuale con anteprime di foto e piccoli
filmati o interviste e con la possibilità di prenotare prodotti e servizi
direttamente dalle varie aziende online.
Testo video
Italia Segreta è un progetto di viaggio attraverso l’Italia
alla ricerca dei luoghi più belli e sconosciuti, delle storie piú interessanti,
delle realtà locali e delle eccellenze del territorio.
L’idea nasce dal nostro percorso di vita: viviamo e
lavoriamo da 4 anni a Berlino pur rimanendo molto legati alla nostra terra di
origine. 
Questa nuova vita ci ha aperto una prospettiva diversa con
cui guardare il nostro paese e ci siamo accorti di quanto la conoscenza
dell’Italia all’estero sia limitata alle solite mete famose e blasonate, come
Roma, Venezia e Firenze.
Così è nata l’idea di mostrare al mondo l’Italia Segreta,
quella dei paesaggi mozzafiato, dei borghi sconosciuti e delle eccellenze
culinarie e artigiane.
Abbiamo pensato di affrontare questo viaggio sapendo di
incontrare un paese colpito da una profonda crisi economica e sociale e
vogliamo che questo sia un trampolino di rilancio per un turismo consapevole,
culturale e pulito.
Il viaggio in se non ha un percorso stabilito ma solo un
punto di partenza e uno di arrivo: i due comuni estremi d’Italia. Da Predoi a
Lampedusa procederemo seguendo il caso, il flusso degli eventi, le storie, le
esperienze e gli incontri che faremo lungo il cammino.
Il budget che abbiamo fissato è necessario per coprire le
spese di viaggio, di allestimento dello studio mobile sul camper con cui ci
sposteremo lungo lo stivale e di stampa del volume “Italia Segreta” Atlante
Visuale d’Italia. 
Con il tuo contributo puoi comprare una o più copie del
libro in formato cartaceo di lusso o in formato digitale oppure puoi finanziare
direttamente parte del progetto diventando sponsor o media partner di Italia
Segreta.
Durante il viaggio terremo un diario di bordo sul blog www.italiasegreta.com su cui
confluiranno le anteprime delle foto dei meravigliosi paesaggi italiani, i
filmati e i racconti delle nostre avventure e degli incontri che faremo.
Tutto il materiale raccolto sarà elaborato alla fine del
viaggio per creare un docu-film sulla nostra esperienza e una App interattiva
che permetterà di accedere istantaneamente al grande database di contenuti:
luoghi, storie, strutture ricettive, artigiani, agriturismi, ristoranti,
piccole aziende d’eccellenza, produttori a km0, luoghi delle tradizioni
enogastronomiche.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

And you also have a core made out of cork and flax fabric which gives the board more damping. You probably noticed that the board has a different pop compared to the other board you just skated. </p><p><i><strong>Mike:</strong> Hmm, There’s different effect for sure. It definitely feels much lighter. </i></p><p><strong>bufo:</strong> Were the ollies higher on this board, or was the other one better?</p><p><i><strong>Mike: </strong>The ollies were definitely higher. The board has much more pop. You get the feeling that the board is attached to your feet and you don’t need to pull it up.</i></p><p><strong>bufo:</strong> What this core effectively does is very important for the park skater. Because of the high amount of flex fabric in the core it makes the board very stiff, and, amongst other things, extremely torsion resistant. As a result, the board reacts much directer in its power transmission</p><p><i><strong>Mike: </strong>Thats amazing, incredible. Especially when you push through in the ramps. When you push in the corners l, you gain a lot of speed, because you usually push pretty hard into the ramps with the board. At some point you have the feeling you’re going to lose control. I didn’t have it with that board.</i></p><p><strong>bufo:</strong> Yes, that’s down to the torsional strength of the board, which really makes the difference. And , in comparison to other boards, you’ll notice that this board is extremely stiff  although, actually lengthwise, its flex is relatively normal.</p><div>

<p><i><strong>Julia: </strong>How did you come up with the idea of building such boards?</i></p>
<p><strong>bufo: </strong>Originally I was looking for better cushioning properties in surfboards and in particular for skateboards. Skateboarding provides a great example of having to deal with insane vibrations. Especially when you’re on small wheels.The cork is helping to smooth that issue out greatly. </p>
<p><i><strong>Debby: </strong>What exactly are they made of? What’s this in the middle here? </i></p>
<p><strong>bufo: </strong>The inner core is a 3 dimensional compound made from a mix of granulated cork and flax fabric. As a result, a 3D structure is formed which works very efficiently. You may have seen it for example on a  construction crane where you always have those 45° degree crossing poles in the middle. This leads not only to an extremely high shear strength, but also to an extremely high fracture strength   </p>
<p><i><strong>Debby: </strong>But it's already a cork plate that you coat?</i></p>
<p><strong>bufo: </strong>No, we mix the core ourself. We’ve built our own core press with which we press the granulated cork and the flax fibre into a mould. The mould was produced by a 3D printer. It’s a bit like baking a cake, but with 10 tones of material.  That’s how we make the 3D compound. </p>
<p>The second step of the procedure is to laminate the board from the top and the bottom. This gives the  board its strength. So now the boards have a core as well as a top and bottom layer. This is known as a sandwich construction, and is how the stiffness is created. And, as you can hear, a great damping. </p>
<p><i><strong>Debby: </strong>How many different models are there already? </i></p>
<p><strong>bufo: </strong>In total there are 13 or 14 boards. From those we have 5 favourites which have already received very good feedback. And those are the ones we want to put onto the market. </p>
<p><i><strong>Julia: </strong>And you do that where?</i></p>
<p><strong>bufo: </strong>We do that on the »Platzprojekt«, next to the 2er skate park. We have 3 containers there.</p>
<p><i><strong>Debby: </strong>How long have you been doing this?</i></p>
<p><strong>bufo: </strong>I have been building surfboards and skateboards for almost 30 years now. It all started  when I was a child. I couldn't get a surfboard at that time because,  as a 9 year old, I was much lighter than most adults. And most of all I wanted to have a shortboard. That wasn't so easy and especially not for my height. That's why I started to build boards by myself - in all variations. And I haven’t stopped since.</p>
<p><i><strong>Debby: </strong>And was the cork board your own creation? Or have they been around for a while?  </i></p>
<p><strong>bufo: </strong>The idea to make skateboards using a cork core isn’t new. What’s really new here though is the fact that the cork we use is so shear resistant and that we can make an extremely fracture-proof board which is much more fracture resistant than wood boards. . You’d definitely have to make the core very thick in order to make it work. And that’s not a good idea for a skateboard. You’d stand much too high and still wouldn’t have a lot of clearance on the wheels.That’s why a thin board always feels much nicer, unless it bangs on your shin. HAHA </p>
<p><i><strong>Julia: </strong>ith the Cruiser you can gather momentum really easily without pushing.That was really cool. I think I just saw you do it. How does that work? </i></p>
<p><strong>bufo: </strong>You mean generating speed using the energy of the curve. Our skateboards have a three axis construction in the laminate. One axis runs lengthwise ensuring the board doesn’t break.  Your everyday skateboard has a cross direction.Instead we have  two 45° degree crossing constructions. And, if you look at the board in more detail, and really twist the board, that’s to say bend the sides in opposite directions, you’ll notice that the board is much more torsionally rigid is than a normal board made from wood. That helps a  great deal to convert turn-impulses on the skateboard. That’s fantastic for when you’re in the skatepark, or even when you’re on the street, because you can generate speed through the curves.</p>

<p><i><strong>Rene: </strong>It’s amazing that the board is totally waterproof. The bearings could still be an issue though. </i></p>
<p><strong>bufo: </strong>You could use ceramic bearings. Personally, I put a drop of oil on the standard bearings. But really only a drop. I’ve been doing that since I was a kid. </p>
<p><i><strong>Rene: </strong>Penetrating oil absorbs moisture. Of course, that makes sense. I’ll have to try that out.</i></p>
<p><strong>bufo: </strong>My bearings are about 7 years old. I hardly ever ride a bike. I prefer my skateboard, it’s much more enjoyable. You can drink beer and have your hands free if you have to make a call. Simply much more enjoyable. And you can do anything you want. You’re allowed to drink a beer and make a call at the same time. </p>

<p><i><strong>Mascha: </strong>But I thought the cork would dissolve. </i></p>
<p><strong>bufo: </strong>No, people know that from wine cork. They sometimes fish bottles from the Baltic Sea which have been down there for 400 years or so.They still have the corks.

He is the inventor of our new green composite technology, named HARDCORK®. By mixing cork with fibres and matrix in a very special way, he succeed in creating a cork fabric composite which is ultra sturdy and is spectacularly strong. The process retains all the positive properties of cork, like its lightness, smoothness, durability, damping and absorbing properties. That‘s really revolutionary! The perfect core material for boardsport applications is formed. After three years of prototyping, intensive testing and optimization, we‘re glad to present to you  the best performing decks you have ever skated.TESTDRIVEIf you are interested in a test drive or individual advice from Rouven (bufo) Brauers, you‘re welcome to visit us in 30453 Hannover, Fössestraße 103 (Platzprojekt) HARD TO BEATSTRONG & DURABLEOur decks are incredibly strong and durable. The lifespan is at least four times longer than that of other skatedecks and they features an integrated high density tail and nose protector.LIGHTERThe composite material also makes HARDCORK® decks up to 40% lighter. The board is more responsive and reacts to you directly.POP & ELASTICITYWith HARDCORK® you’ll reach the next level of skating! It has incredible pop and flex. You can jump higher and ride smoother. The elasticity of the cork absorbs shockwaves on uneven surfaces.WATERPROOFOur decks are 100% waterproof. They keep their properties for a lifetime and don’t soften up like other conventional wooden decks. (except our parkboard Peter, he‘s a hybrid)UNIQUE LOOKThe cork and noble wooden surfaces give the boards  with a unique look.»Corkgrip« is our special grippy cork surface. It performs like griptape, but is softer. It doesn’t damage your clothes while you are carrying it and allows you to skate barefoot. You can easily cover it with classical griptape if you want. Every aspect of Our boards is customisable, allowing each board to have it own unique look.ECOLOGICALHARDCORK® decks are extremely ecological. 75% of the material used is regrowing. Our whole production process is solvent free and we only use eco-friendly organic resin. PETER, FATBOY, TC, HANS & THE ANGLERYou have the choice between five innovative bufo® shapes.The boards are engineered, designed and manufactured in Germany. PETER POPSICLE hybridPeter provides the well-known skate feeling with improved properties. We’ve replaced half of the wood with a HARCORK® core layer. This gives the board more pop, makes it lighter and more responsive.Shape: Popsicle, medium concaveSurface: maple wood  •  Core: HARCORK®Style: Park-/Streetboard  •  Length: 32“  •  Width: 8.6“  •  Wheelbase: 13,5“FATBOYFatboy is the perfect Mini Cruiser with great ollie ability. He is a real allrounder and also feels good in pools. He comes with a 14.5” wheelbase and a tight turning radius. The deck is 9,5” wide but thanks to the HARDCORK® construction still very light with great pop.Shape: Wide with medium concave, modern tailkickSurface bottom: »Slickcork«, our excellent gliding surface with a glossy cork lookSurface top: »Corkgrip«; our special grippy cork surface.Corkgrip performs like griptape, but is softer.

His concave increases on the outside rails for improved hold in critical slides. His bowl shaped tail can‘t normally be built in the traditional way, but thanks to the drapeability of our new composite material, he has become real!The Angler is also suitable for simply cruising around and many surfers love it because they can keep a wider stance on the board. He comes with our longest wheelbase of 25.5“ - adjustable to 26.5“ and 27.5“.Shape: Bullit outline, lowered center, mushroom bowl tailSurface bottom: »Slickcork«, our excellent gliding surface with a glossy cork lookSurface top: Dark »Corkgrip«; our special grippy cork surface.Corkgrip performs like griptape, but is softer.

SKATE EXPERIENCEOur boards have been tested extensively since the first prototype was developed. Our test pilots are life long skaters around and our series production models are already very popular locally.

SKATER FEEDBACKfrom our testpilot Mike at Rouven (bufo) Brauers about the HARDCORK protoypeMike: It’s a nice board. Isn’t it.bufo: Nice board.Mike: Nice board.bufo: So what I did, I narrowed the outline by 4mm compared to the first board. And you also have a core made out of cork and flax fabric which gives the board more damping. You probably noticed that the board has a different pop compared to the other board you just skated. Mike: Hmm, There’s different effect for sure. It definitely feels much lighter. bufo: Were the ollies higher on this board, or was the other one better?Mike: The ollies were definitely higher. The board has much more pop. You get the feeling that the board is attached to your feet and you don’t need to pull it up.bufo: What this core effectively does is very important for the park skater. Because of the high amount of flex fabric in the core it makes the board very stiff, and, amongst other things, extremely torsion resistant. As a result, the board reacts much directer in its power transmissionMike: Thats amazing, incredible. Especially when you push through in the ramps. When you push in the corners l, you gain a lot of speed, because you usually push pretty hard into the ramps with the board. At some point you have the feeling you’re going to lose control. I didn’t have it with that board.bufo: Yes, that’s down to the torsional strength of the board, which really makes the difference. And , in comparison to other boards, you’ll notice that this board is extremely stiff  although, actually lengthwise, its flex is relatively normal.

IT‘S ALL ABOUT CORK

SKATESISTER'S QUESTIONSfrom lokals Julia and Debby at Rouven (bufo) Brauers about the HARDCORK® Skateboards

Julia: How did you come up with the idea of building such boards?
bufo: Originally I was looking for better cushioning properties in surfboards and in particular for skateboards. Skateboarding provides a great example of having to deal with insane vibrations. Especially when you’re on small wheels.The cork is helping to smooth that issue out greatly.

You may have seen it for example on a  construction crane where you always have those 45° degree crossing poles in the middle. This leads not only to an extremely high shear strength, but also to an extremely high fracture strength   
Debby: But it's already a cork plate that you coat?
bufo: No, we mix the core ourself. We’ve built our own core press with which we press the granulated cork and the flax fibre into a mould. The mould was produced by a 3D printer. It’s a bit like baking a cake, but with 10 tones of material.  That’s how we make the 3D compound. 
The second step of the procedure is to laminate the board from the top and the bottom. This gives the  board its strength. So now the boards have a core as well as a top and bottom layer. This is known as a sandwich construction, and is how the stiffness is created. And, as you can hear, a great damping. 
Debby: How many different models are there already? 
bufo: In total there are 13 or 14 boards. From those we have 5 favourites which have already received very good feedback. And those are the ones we want to put onto the market. 
Julia: And you do that where?
bufo: We do that on the »Platzprojekt«, next to the 2er skate park. We have 3 containers there.
Debby: How long have you been doing this?
bufo: I have been building surfboards and skateboards for almost 30 years now. It all started  when I was a child.

Julia: ith the Cruiser you can gather momentum really easily without pushing.That was really cool. I think I just saw you do it. How does that work? 
bufo: You mean generating speed using the energy of the curve. Our skateboards have a three axis construction in the laminate. One axis runs lengthwise ensuring the board doesn’t break.  Your everyday skateboard has a cross direction.Instead we have  two 45° degree crossing constructions. And, if you look at the board in more detail, and really twist the board, that’s to say bend the sides in opposite directions, you’ll notice that the board is much more torsionally rigid is than a normal board made from wood. That helps a  great deal to convert turn-impulses on the skateboard. That’s fantastic for when you’re in the skatepark, or even when you’re on the street, because you can generate speed through the curves.

The lttl tumbler will keep any beverage hot or cold for hours, so you can fill it with 16 ounces of any beverage you like: coffee, tea, iced and carbonated drinks, or a lttl beer or wine. The lttl tumbler has durable components and finishes so it can go on the top rack of your dishwasher. It's entirely BPA and BPS free, and there are absolutely no coatings, paint, or lining inside the vessel.The lttl tumbler is launching in five colors: brushed stainless, matte black, soft lavender, pale rose gold, and malachite. Brushed stainless, matte black, and malachite tumblers come with a black stopper, while soft lavender and pale rose gold tumblers come with a white stopper. In the past 15 years, Matt and Gaz have helped dozens of clients bring hundreds of products to market. We've been down a similar road before, and we're well prepared to do it on our own this time.The risks and potential challenges to this project have been minimized as much as possible in advance. We've been working with our factory's engineers to productionize the design. The overseas manufacturing partner we've engaged for this project is a trusted colleague that we've worked with for over a decade. The engineering, manufacturing, quality control and distribution plans are already in place.  All that's left is to garner the support of the Indiegogo community so we can pay for the molds and tools necessary to start mass production.We pledge to actively deal with any challenges in a timely and professionally manner, and to be transparent and accurate as we keep you informed. We're excited to update our community regularly as we reach our production milestones.Thanks in advance for your generous support. Every lttl bit helps!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>You can't change your DNA.  Well, at least not yet.  But if you were raised in a home with certain values, you probably DID absorb those same values.  Are you sure?</div>

<p><em><br/></em>The idea for this book spawned from my experiences as a reporter and radio talk show host.  Too often, well intentioned people identified themselves by political party but then described how their party no longer supports their views.  Other times, I would interview protestors who did not understand exactly what they were protesting for or against.</p>
<p>The first part of the book will go over my views and HOW I developed them, the changes over the years and why those views and changes of view came to be.</p>
<p>The next section will go through the Constitution of the United States AND how to apply it.  I will, WE will be sharing experiences that we have had already AND a few new ones will be happening to CREATE the stories for this book.  There are 27 Amendments to the Constitution.  All 27 will be discussed and demonstrated.</p>
<p>The end will include some tips to cut through the opinions of OTHERS and get to your own.</p>
<p>The tools to fix this is within ourselves. With this book, I hope that we can together be that enlightened and informed mass of people that Thomas Jefferson knew that our Republic needs to survive.</p></div>","You may be thinking about things the wrong way.

The next section will go through the Constitution of the United States AND how to apply it.  I will, WE will be sharing experiences that we have had already AND a few new ones will be happening to CREATE the stories for this book.  There are 27 Amendments to the Constitution.  All 27 will be discussed and demonstrated.
The end will include some tips to cut through the opinions of OTHERS and get to your own.
The tools to fix this is within ourselves. With this book, I hope that we can together be that enlightened and informed mass of people that Thomas Jefferson knew that our Republic needs to survive.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Wildcat Adventure Race (W.A.R.)</h3>
<p>This summer 2013! The 9Lives Adventures team is proud to present another, Canadian first-ever inclusive, weekend event. Our skilled and seasoned adventure-cats have come together to create an endurance course that will change the life of many. The<em> Wildcat Adventure Race (W.A.R.)</em> is comprised of 9 scenario-based obstacles that will test our participant’s abilities, teamwork, strength, navigation and heart. Together they will break down these barriers, and fight for a charity or organization of their team choice.</p>
<p><br/>This race is open to people of all abilities, not limited to: Amputees, wheelchair users, visual or hearing impairment.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>What Makes This Race So Different?</strong>
</h3>
<p>90% of pre-existing adventure races support local charities/ organizations. The 9Lives <em>W.A.R.</em> not only allows each team to fight for their OWN charity of choice, we actually incorporate the “wounded warrior” into the race experience and change the social mentality one individual at a time. Inclusivity.</p>

They partner with community-based youth organizations and caring adult volunteers who act as mentors in the field to help young people realize their potential. Their curriculum improves integrity, self- esteem, responsibility, decision-making abilities and communication skills in close to 1,000 youth annually. Why give?You can help revolutionize the travel industry.  This is a chance to bring a unique service to life and allow you to name your own price on travel.You can help impact people's lives in a positive way.  Many of our travelers walk away with a great sense of accomplishment after hanging hundreds of feet from the side of a cliff.  This has led many to make life changing decisions and a renewed outlook on life.Ten percent of your contributions to this campaign will go directly to helping fund Bonvoy's support to Big City Mountaineers and its efforts. What we needBonvoy has been a labor of love and to date has been fully self funded.  We have invested over $250,000 into Bonvoy.  Those funds have helped us scout trips, develop itineraries, develop a worldclass website, and build a small but loyal customer base. Over the past 2 years we have learned a lot and are ready to grow but we need your help.  We are requesting $20,000 to assist with acquiring office space, office equipment and bringing on some extremely talented staff to manage public relations, social and content marketing, and corporate sales.Donations will directly fund:

Additional staffing 


Office equipment including computers, furniture, etc.


Rent for office space 

Even if you are unable to give we hope you'll support our efforts by sharing this project with your friends and family.  We greatly appreciate your support and thank you for your donations.PerksWe're giving away some amazing stuff for our generous donees.  T-shirts, water bottles, hats, fleeces, and even trips!

<p>The Doughy Maker is a perfect addition for your campfire, barbecue grill, camp stove, or backyard fire pit.  The Doughy project is about gathering people together to share a delicious camp fire and grilling treat and enjoy the outdoors together. <strong>Doughies</strong> not only taste great, but they give you a great excuse to get together with your friends or family. We want to give every Indiegogo viewer the opportunity to make doughies for themselves and in the process, have a great new reason to reconnect with friends and family.  We think you'll want to invite everyone over for a Doughy night.</p>

<p>Doughies are made by cooking pieces of pop-open biscuit dough to a golden brown in our unique new pan, rolling them in butter, and then rolling them in cinnamon and sugar.  It is as simple as that but the taste will keep you coming back for more.

<p> <strong>Welcome to the Doughy Maker Project</strong></p>
<p>My name is Jesse Cooley.  My family and I are the inventor of the <strong>Doughy Maker </strong><em>(<strong>patent pending</strong>)</em>.  We are so excited to share our invention with Indiegogo contributors and hope you will love Doughies as much as we do.  </p>
<p>With your help we will fund the manufacturing that will take the Doughy Maker beyond our little family circle. Our prototypes of the <strong>Doughy Maker </strong>have turned out awesome, but we need to raise money to build additional production molds and to fund our production process in order to give our Indiegogo backers the chance to experience this fun and delicious treat. </p>
<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>I am a college studend studying human physiology and developmental biology, but I have always considered myself an entrepreneur. Now its time to really prove it.  I am confident that with your help we can make this project a great success.  Thanks so much for supporting us and the Doughy Maker on Indiegogo.  </p>
<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>The Doughy Maker was born of ingenuity and a passion for delicious food and the outdoors. However, the birthing process for the Doughy Maker was a bit painful.  You should have seen some of the early prototypes.  They started out with pans we bought at the grocery store, a makeshift handle pounded into shape with a big hammer and an anvil, and with a cotter pin to keep it shut. Needless to say we’ve come a very long way since then.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Doughy Maker evolved into what it is today, so fun and easy to use. - Telescoping adjustable handle, non-stick cooking coating, and 10 holes to match the 10 pieces of dough in one of those ""pop-open"" dough packages.</p>
<p><img alt=""Cook Doughies to a Golden Brown"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/951151/pictures/full/20130726164328-Opening_Pan.JPG?1374882599"" src="""" style=""""/>Now, with new Doughy Maker prototypes completed, we can make Doughies <strong><em>almost</em></strong> perfect, <strong><em>almost</em></strong> every time. Once the Doughies are golden brown, simply roll them in melted butter, then roll them in a cinnamon and sugar mixture and you'll see smiles that won't stop until you run out of dough. Doughies are the best thing to happen to camping and grilling since the invention of fire.</p>
<p><strong>USE OF FUNDS</strong></p>
<p>The Doughy Maker project has now moved to the point where our prototypes are almost perfected.  We are still working out small details to refine and finish the manufacturing process. We have plans in place that will make the Doughy Maker rock. We are seeking $50,000 in Indiegogo contributions that will be used for putting the finishing touches on the prototypes and build the production molds, so that we can get the Doughy Maker out to our Indiegogo fans faster.</p>
<p>Specifically, Indiegogo funds will be used for the production and other manufacturing costs as necessary to fulfill this project.  Up to this point, we have been using molds that were built for our prototyping process, not designed for long-term use. In other parts of the Doughy Maker we are not using molds at all but are crafting parts using materials currently available on the open market. Improving these parts requires us to build molds.  This will make the product even better.  These molds are very expensive and your contributions will be greatly appreciated. Once again, thanks for believing in us.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>There are many risks that can arise in opposition to completing this project. Our experience has been that because of our small size, we wield no significant clout with suppliers and manufacturers. As such, our orders can be pushed to the back of the line. Orders are always fulfilled but sometimes not in as timely a manner as we would like.</p>
<p>However, significant lead times have been built into this project in order to account for this type of schedule risk. In other words, we have significantly padded the schedule. As such, we should be able to meet the proposed schedule for delivery of all Indiegogo rewards without difficulty. If difficulties arise, we will email each contributor in an effort to keep you informed of our situation and progress. Additionally, we will continue to work with those helping us with our manufacturing to minimize the effect of any new risk situations as much as possible.  Thanks for believing in us.</p>

<h2><strong>INTRODUCING THE BLANKET ANCHOR®...2013</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>NYC - Rockaway Beach</strong></h2>
<p><img alt=""Costa Rica Blanket Anchor &amp; Sarong"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/822463/pictures/full/20130521080037-Costa_Rica_touched_up.jpg?1369148442"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><em>Blanket Anchor® Peg Set</em></p>
<h3><strong>WHAT IS THE BLANKET ANCHOR®?</strong></h3>
<p>The Blanket Anchor® is a new patent pending revolutionary set of brand-able beach tools that anchor your blowing blanket to the sand. This unique product comes in sets of (4) 6-inch pegs packaged neatly in a little mesh bag.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>CATALYST THAT SPAWNED THE CREATION</strong></h3>
<p>It all started in July 2011, on a birthday trip to Bermuda where I was assaulted with pink sand having packed very lightly for a day at Horse Shoe Bay. (Aside: Did you know that the pink sand in Bermuda is actually the poop from the Parrot Fish? Nice, right? I didn't see any t-shirts proclaiming that tid bit!) Anyhoo, I discovered sand / poo in unwelcome places for 3 days. I returned to NYC and went to Rockaway Beach for a leisurely day in the sun.  I took a big frozen water, my book, a towel, my ipod  and some fruit.  The gusts of wind felt great in the hot sun but my blanket persisted in being unruly, resulting in sandpaper skin.  So, I grabbed all of the items that I took for my enjoyment and used them to hold the corners down. I then sat in the middle of my blanket, angry, looking at my configuration. I said, ""there has to be something effective that I can buy so I won't have to deal with the 4 corner fumble!"" I resolved to battle with sand for the last time and decided to do something about it.  And as they say, they rest is history and <em>necessity is truly the mother of invention.</em></p>
<p><em><img alt=""The Blanket Anchor Close Up!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/822449/pictures/full/20130521074922-BA_eater_ppt_Logo_dark_blue.jpg?1369147765"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p>
<h3><strong>WHAT MAKES THE BLANKET ANCHOR® UNIQUE?</strong></h3>
<p>For ages people have dealt with the fumbling blanket syndrome at the beach.  We are so accustomed to playing 4 corners with our blankets that this product, designed in this manner does not exist.  Your flip flops are too light, your water bottle will get hot and you planned to read that book, right?  Well, no more fuss and no more blowing blanket, just grab your pegs and go! It's a pretty simple idea that we have taken great lengths to develop and now we need your help to produce it!!</p>
<p>We went a step further after making our prototypes and added a branding feature where the tops of the pegs can be customized.  We are not only introducing a fun and useful product, we are introducing a new category of beach advertising. Currently, the plane dragging the sign is our competition and we feel very confident that our product idea will be much more effective.</p>

<h3><strong>HOW DO BLANKET ANCHORS® WORK?</strong></h3>
<p>The base is twisted or screwed clockwise into the sand until the clamp is flush with the sand and then you gently grip the corner of your blanket to hold it in place.</p>

<p><em>Twist! &amp; Clip!</em></p>
<p>The resistance created between the sand interlocking auger at the base (in the wet sand) and the topical surface of the sand enable the consumer to roll about with no worries on top their blanket without it becoming disheveled. </p>
<p>We went through great lengths to make sure that the pegs had some sort of mechanism at the base that actually had the ability to remain secure and solid in sand as well as combat sudden gusts of wind.  They even work in grass. And as a result, when screwed down, flush with the sand - Blanket Anchors® are able to withstand up to 15 lbs of tension.  Yes, much more than necessary for a windy day at the beach, and if it were any windier you should be seeking shelter - but hey they really work and that was our goal!   </p>
<p><em>Everyone</em> goes to the beach and research shows that 180 million people make 2 billion visits to U.S. beaches annually and close to 1 billion people frequent beaches globally. For instance in Brazil, close to 100,000 sunbathers can be found on a stretch of beach on a weekday afternoon and not necessarily on a holiday. So as you can see - the world needs Blanket Anchors® - there is an extremely vast market for this revolutionary new product.</p>
<p>Our starting product line-up consists of branded Blanket Anchor® pegs, Blankets, Towels and Sarongs. We paired up the pegs with blankets to form the Blanket Anchor® Kit which consists of the (4) branded pegs and (1) matching oversized 60 x 80 blanket. </p>

When was the last time something innovative was created for the beach? The first Beach Volleyball game, created by William G. Morgan was played in 1915 in Hawaii. The Beach Ball was invented by Jonathon DeLonge from California in 1938.  The Frisbee was invented by Walter Frederick Morrison in 1950, also from California.
 
INTRODUCING THE BLANKET ANCHOR®...2013
NYC - Rockaway Beach

Blanket Anchor® Peg Set
WHAT IS THE BLANKET ANCHOR®?
The Blanket Anchor® is a new patent pending revolutionary set of brand-able beach tools that anchor your blowing blanket to the sand. This unique product comes in sets of (4) 6-inch pegs packaged neatly in a little mesh bag.
 
CATALYST THAT SPAWNED THE CREATION
It all started in July 2011, on a birthday trip to Bermuda where I was assaulted with pink sand having packed very lightly for a day at Horse Shoe Bay. (Aside: Did you know that the pink sand in Bermuda is actually the poop from the Parrot Fish? Nice, right? I didn't see any t-shirts proclaiming that tid bit!) Anyhoo, I discovered sand / poo in unwelcome places for 3 days. I returned to NYC and went to Rockaway Beach for a leisurely day in the sun.  I took a big frozen water, my book, a towel, my ipod  and some fruit.  The gusts of wind felt great in the hot sun but my blanket persisted in being unruly, resulting in sandpaper skin.  So, I grabbed all of the items that I took for my enjoyment and used them to hold the corners down. I then sat in the middle of my blanket, angry, looking at my configuration. I said, ""there has to be something effective that I can buy so I won't have to deal with the 4 corner fumble!"" I resolved to battle with sand for the last time and decided to do something about it.  And as they say, they rest is history and necessity is truly the mother of invention.

WHAT MAKES THE BLANKET ANCHOR® UNIQUE?
For ages people have dealt with the fumbling blanket syndrome at the beach.  We are so accustomed to playing 4 corners with our blankets that this product, designed in this manner does not exist.  Your flip flops are too light, your water bottle will get hot and you planned to read that book, right?  Well, no more fuss and no more blowing blanket, just grab your pegs and go! It's a pretty simple idea that we have taken great lengths to develop and now we need your help to produce it!!
We went a step further after making our prototypes and added a branding feature where the tops of the pegs can be customized.  We are not only introducing a fun and useful product, we are introducing a new category of beach advertising. Currently, the plane dragging the sign is our competition and we feel very confident that our product idea will be much more effective.

HOW DO BLANKET ANCHORS® WORK?
The base is twisted or screwed clockwise into the sand until the clamp is flush with the sand and then you gently grip the corner of your blanket to hold it in place.

Twist! & Clip!
The resistance created between the sand interlocking auger at the base (in the wet sand) and the topical surface of the sand enable the consumer to roll about with no worries on top their blanket without it becoming disheveled. 
We went through great lengths to make sure that the pegs had some sort of mechanism at the base that actually had the ability to remain secure and solid in sand as well as combat sudden gusts of wind.  They even work in grass. And as a result, when screwed down, flush with the sand - Blanket Anchors® are able to withstand up to 15 lbs of tension.  Yes, much more than necessary for a windy day at the beach, and if it were any windier you should be seeking shelter - but hey they really work and that was our goal!   
Everyone goes to the beach and research shows that 180 million people make 2 billion visits to U.S. beaches annually and close to 1 billion people frequent beaches globally. For instance in Brazil, close to 100,000 sunbathers can be found on a stretch of beach on a weekday afternoon and not necessarily on a holiday. So as you can see - the world needs Blanket Anchors® - there is an extremely vast market for this revolutionary new product.
Our starting product line-up consists of branded Blanket Anchor® pegs, Blankets, Towels and Sarongs. We paired up the pegs with blankets to form the Blanket Anchor® Kit which consists of the (4) branded pegs and (1) matching oversized 60 x 80 blanket.

On an adventure in the mountains…
Or in the office…
Take your food or leftovers anywhere without leaking or spills. Guaranteed. You'll never throw away a container again.
 Why?We created the GreenTraveler to offer a solution to people who want a convenient, travel-friendly way to take food on-the-go without messes like these:
While trying to use other portable containers, we were tired of leaks, spills, having only one compartment leaving our food soggy, inconvenient shapes and sizes that don't fit in a bag, and throwing away disposable to-go containers that didn't work very well anyway.With GreenTraveler as your primary container you may be amazed how many uses it has - keep liquids in, keep rain and water out, store food and beverages, use for first aid or baby supplies, or for any items you need protected. What?GreenTraveler is a cylinder with carabiner loops and 6 compartments that won't leak, spill or break. Modeled from a water bottle which we carry everywhere to avoid disposable plastic bottles.
For this size and shape, plastic is still the best material. But don't be afraid of it. It has no BPA or phthalates so it won't leach chemicals in your food, even in a microwave. The plastic used in the Original GreenTraveler is approved by the food safety foundations for food around the world.GreenTraveler Specs​
 
For Who?
 
GreenTraveler is not only for adventure travel or active lifestyles. It is for the commuter who goes to a job all day. The student who goes to school. Hobbyist photographers or fishermen. The GreenTraveler is for people who leave the house and want good food wherever they are. 
 
The world has taken notice..... How does it work?The Original GreenTraveler may feel like a puzzle the first time, but once you get the hang of it, you'll wonder why it didn't exist before.... 
Assembly and disassembly are super easy!
Just put some food in it and off you go :)
 How Much?The Original GreenTraveler replaces many items you may use every day.GreenTraveler is worth the price!
Until Mid January, the Original GreenTraveler is being sold at an Indiegogo discount from retail price to reward those early adopters that support us in making this project a reality! See the rewards available to the right.
 Perks  Custom designed insulated carrying pouch Add-On by Bluewave. Measures 14""x4"" with an added pocket for utensil plus what is shown above. $23 includes shipping worldwide.End caps to hold two center body compartments tightly together to make a smaller liquid-tight GreenTraveler without the need for cups. $8 includes shipping worldwide!Put them all together in a great value bundle!What if?We have a consultant living next to the manufacturing facility who is nearly like a partner, conducting continuous 3rd party quality control. But what if your GT breaks or you don't like it?Warranty:Manufacturer's defects are covered for a month. Just send picture or video of the defect to us and we will get a replacement part sent to you.GreenTraveler covers its products under normal use for life. We want you to enjoy our products your whole life and never see them in a landfill. We also offer a recycling program to provide a replacement part with free shipping if you ship the broken part to us (or send a photo of it in the proper recycle bin). See our website for warranty details. What's Next?We have planned for a couple years in the future with logistics, partnerships, financial proformas, and designs of new products we will launch. All we need is the successful launch of this first product with initial funding for injection molding and we can give you much more convenience while traveling.Connect with us on social media and stay tuned as we have new innovations coming to you!  Then and NowThis project  kept calling us to be born! This is our first crowdfunding campaign, but not our first business. As serial entrepreneurs with finance experience, we put all our intelligence, time, and money starting in November 2015 to make GreenTraveler a reality with full force. Here is how far we've come:

<h3>The Current Situation in Tanzania</h3>
<h4>Hot Rooms</h4>
<p>A common practice to keep babies warm in Tanzania is to simply keep an entire room heated to temperatures close to 100°F. Such an environment is prime for outbreaks of disease and infection. One of the hospitals we have worked with reported that in 2010,   30 of 33 infants
died within one week due to the rapid spread of infection in a hot room. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/747177/files/20140727133052-baby_ward.png?1406493052"" src="""" style=""width: 290.230769230769px; height: 147px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, the heat is nearly unbearable for already underpaid and overworked doctors and nurses. The working conditions in these wards many time discourage perspective healthcare workers from joining  the industry. Furthermore, the uncomfortable heat encourages quick and less-than personalized attention for the at-risk babies. The Life Blanket not only helps the babies by providing a safe warming method, but it also helps the nurses and doctors have a more comfortable work environment- which in turn means the babies will be more well attended! </p>
<h4>Donated Incubators</h4>
<p>A common, although unfortunately misguided, practice to attempt to solve this lack of warming instruments is for industrialized countries to donate high-tech, expensive, and complex incubators.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/747190/files/20140727133538-fancy_incubator.png?1406493338"" src="""" style=""width: 223.846153846154px; height: 194px;""/></p>
<p>The impoverished and needy recipients are many times disappointed; an estimated 48% of the $20,000 to $40,000 worth of the donated machinery arrives unusable. Furthermore, maintenance is expensive and complicated. If any parts of the incubators break, the entire system is useless until more donated parts can be shipped (if they are lucky enough to even receive them at all). Additionally, due to the lack of necessary training and manuals, the technicians are many times unable to repair the incubators anyway. Overall, donated goods usually end up being unusable after some time. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/747013/files/20140727121535-broken_incubator.png?1406488535"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Makeshift Warming</h4>
<p>For those who do not have the capability to warm an entire ward, or those who do not have access to the few donated supplies given to Tanzanian hospitals, the healthcare providers have to use more makeshift methods: heat-lamps usually used for animals or food, boiled water bottles, industrial continuously-heating pads, or even just bundles of normal blankets. These ""one-size-fits-all"" methods are not the most preferable when compared to individualized care provided by The Life Blanket. </p>

<h3>Who We Are and What is Project EMPOWER?</h3>
<p>We are three guys from Galway, Ireland. The sport of rugby brought us together almost 20 years ago when Damian and Fergus played for the Galwegians RFC senior team that MacDara managed. Damian and Fergus are in their very early forties and MacDara is at least a decade older than both of them! All three of us are self employed, Damian as an extreme adventurer and speaker, Fergus owns and operates a small bus company and MacDara is a business consultant specialising in the tourism, leisure and hospitality sectors. In our lives we enjoy and endure the same struggles, challenges and opportunities as most people but what sets us apart is our dogged determination, our never, ever give up attitude  and our absolute belief in the power of ""me"". We believe that digging deep enables us to climb high and we need you to help us prove just how high digging deep can take us and to help us share that learning with the World. These beliefs have helped Damian win European Cups, row the Atlantic solo and climb the worlds highest mountains, have helped Fergus to walk again after suffering a life threatening spinal injury in 2018  and helped MacDara survive the global financial crisis in 2008.</p>
<p>Project EMPOWER has grown out of Damian's ambition to row the Atlantic from New York to Galway, Fergus's ambition to show the World that suffering a life threatening debilitating injury does not mean that life can no longer be lived and MacDara's desire to help us to be our very best selves in every second of every minute of every hour of every day that we're gifted. </p>
<p>Project EMPOWER is a studied endeavour over 24 months encapsulating Fergus and Damian's journey to empower themselves from very different starting points, to prepare for, partake in and persevere through one of the world’s most extreme challenges; <i><strong>Rowing</strong></i> 4937.47km unsupported across <i><strong>the Atlantic Ocean</strong></i> from New York City to Galway in <i><strong>world record time</strong></i>, and to detail the complete experience in a<i><strong> book </strong></i>and <i><strong>documovie</strong></i> that will tell a story, that can empower us all to realise our true potential through planned ambitious endeavour.</p>
<p>Help us to make waves that will break down barriers and EMPOWER us all to be our very best selves. Your contribution will fund the purchase of the boat that will carry Fergus and Damian across the North Atlantic from New York City to Galway in the Summer of 2022. This is your chance to float your boat by floating ours!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As you can imagine, rowing the North Atlantic, publishing a book and making a movie about it so that the World can learn from the lessons taught by the endeavour is not a cheap exercise.  Critical to the project is the boat Damian and Fergus will use in the row. In short, we need the money to but the boat.</p>
<p>Ocean rowing boats are not off the shelf purchases. They are handmade, specially designed bespoke pieces of essential equipment. This boat will be the difference between life and death for Fergus and Damian. In this boat that will be just big enough for both of them, they will encounter huge sea storms, will climb swells higher than your house, and will row for hours on end. The purpose of this campaign is to raise the money we need to buy the boat.</p>
<p>Depending on which tier you decide to purchase there are various different perks from owning one of the project Oars, to having your name on the boat ,to spending quality time with Fergus and Damian at the boat launch, to launching the boat, to having an ocean rowing experience and to getting virtual stickers which you can use on all of your digital platforms to show the World that you are a proud member of the Project EMPOWER tribe. </p>
<p>Funding Project EMPOWER will make dreams come true and will help to show the World what can happen through the focused execution of planned ambitious endeavour. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Through stories, we share passions, fears, sadness, hardships, and joys, and we find common ground with other people so that we can connect and communicate with them. Stories are universal, conveying meaning and purpose that help us understand ourselves better and find commonality with others. The Project EMPOWER story will be a work of fact that will be available to the World and your contribution to this campaign will directly impact our ability to create and share this life forming and affirming story with the World. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks and challenges associated with this endeavour are immense but between us we have amassed a significant body of relevant experience that we believe will enable us to overcome whatever those challenges and risks may be. It is not our first time to undertake an Atlantic rowing challenge. In 2017 Damian successfully delivered a project that saw him overcome many significant obstacles and successfully row solo from Tenerife in the Canaries to Antigua in the Caribbean. Weather mapping and route planning will be hugely important and as an established Ocean Rower, Damian has built considerable expertise in this regard.</p>
<p>Damian and Fergus will have to be in supreme shape physically, mentally and spiritually. Both have proven ability in this regard. Damian as a former professional rugby player and extreme adventurer who has never failed to complete any of his extraordinary planned ambitious endeavours and Fergus who was told he would never walk again in October 2018 but one year later walked 206km from one side of Ireland to the other and in the process raised €70,000 for the Irish National Rehabilitation Clinic.</p>
<p>There will be commercial and logistical challenges and while it is impossible to predict the future, it is important to ensure that our intentions inform our realities. In this regard MacDara has served as commercial director for the 2012 Volvo Ocean Race Grand Finale, has created significant events in Ireland including Galway Skates and Malahide  Skates and as Past President of Junior Chamber Ireland has a significant network of national and international political, social and commercial entrepreneurs who are only to happy to share their expertise to ensure that Project EMPOWER overcomes any commercial or logistical challenges it may encounter. Critically Project EMPOWER is a ""planned"" ambitious endeavour and every effort is being made to guarantee that the plan prepared when executed will deliver the outcomes desired.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that times are tough. The World has been rocked by a pandemic, the scale of which is unprecedented and we fully understand that your resources may not allow you to contribute at this time and this is perfectly fine. However, if you like our project and feel that there are ways you can help please let us know how through our website or social media pages.

<p style=""text-align: center;"">In May 2017 we shipped around 320 sheltaPod awnings to our Indiegogo backers. We then started selling the remaining stock of 180 on our website and SOLD OUT in just TWO months. We now have sheltaPod's all over the world from Alaska to Sri Lanka which is just AWESOME!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">2018</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">For 2018, we're introduced a more neutral grey colour and useful accessories to our product range. We've also made some improvements to the design based on our customer feedback.  </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">sheltaPod is a half dome tent combined with a sun canopy which attaches to the side of the vehicle. But unlike many other campervan awnings, there are no side panels to block the light or obscure your views.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">For campervans with an awning rail there is the gutter rail option (A) where a pole slides into the pole sleeve and then clamps securely in place (please note that the pole and clamps are not supplied with sheltaPod). There is also a bending strip that threads into the C channel (B). If you want to drive away then you also need a Kador strip and figure of eight which can been seen in the photo but does not come with sheltaPod. However we do supply 4 x five meter webbing straps for 'over the top' attachment (C) and you will also see three velcro straps that can attach to roof bars/racks. And finally you can use suction clamps (D) (not supplied) that attach to the pole in the pole sleeve. This is suitable for flat roof vehicles.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">No campervan. No worries! sheltaPod can attach to almost any vehicle using the adjustable webbing/buckle straps included in the bag.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">sheltaPod can also attach to the tailgate of your vehicle if you want better access to the boot space. Perfect for getting changed before and after a days hiking, swimming, cycling, scuba diving, surfing.....you name it! </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Gather up the fabric in each section and clip it to the pole sleeves. Each pole sleeve has several buckles/hoops so they can be clipped against each other. Also on each side of the door there are windbreaker panels which can be tied back when not needed.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">If it starts to rain it's easy to extend the canopy and get more cover. Drop down one or two sections if you still want to enjoy the views. Drop down all the sections, peg into the ground and extend the windbreaker panels for complete shelter. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Pod section provides space for cooking and dining that's out of the wind and rain. It's also great for extra storage for camping equipment, bicycles, surf/diving wetsuits, etc. Just clip in the front panel and your gear is protected.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">If you want more comfort you can clip in the inner tent. This offers extra sleeping space with a mesh panel that gives a view through to the PVC skylight window on the rainfly. Great for stargazing!

<p style=""text-align: center;"">sheltaPod offers a good compromise between size and ease of set up. Just how much space do we really need when we have a campervan next door! Realistically all we need is somewhere to cook and eat outside the van. And the inner tent provides additional sleeping for three adults/two adults &amp; two children which should be enough for family and friends.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">sheltaPod has gone through many redesigns and prototypes. We tried putting a door on the outer rainfly but direct tensioning on the poles made it difficult to zip up once inside the half-dome tent. Eventually we introduced a separate front panel as the best way of protecting gear when not using the inner tent.  We also redesigned the pole connection system for the rainfly, the inner tent connection method and how it attaches to the van. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Each of our FIVE prototypes were fully field tested and redesigned if necessary. All the photos and video on this campaign page show the final 'fully working' pre-production sheltaPod. It is ready for mass production, which is where you come in. There is a minimum order quantity on each colour and so the minimum order is 700 awnings. This is why we are crowdfunding, we need to raise a minimum of $60,000 to get sheltaPod into it's first production run and onto campsites by spring 2017. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We want sheltaPod to attach to most types of vehicle, not just camper vans with awning rails. This is why we have incorporated FIVE different attachment methods:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>C Channel</strong> - using 'figure of 8' and Kador strip (not included) into awning rail</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>J Rail &amp; Pole Sleeve</strong> - Insert pole (not included) into the pole sleeve and then place into J/gutter rail. Use two butterfly clips (not included) to clamp in place at each end where the pole sticks out.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>FOR ATTACHING TO SUV's/JEEPS/VANS WITH NO AWNING RAIL</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Velcro straps</strong> - 3 x velcro double straps allow for attachment to roof/roll bars and roof racks. The hoop sided velcro strap is 14cm and the loop side is 14cm...total 28cm. This provides enough velcro to go around a maximum width bar of 24cm.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Webbing straps with release buckles</strong> - 4x webbing straps in total, 2x are designed to pull the awning taut over the top of the van, then 2x at the side to tension the awning front and back. This is to reduce sideways movement. We supply separate 5 x 5 metre long adjustable webbing straps. They attach to awning using release buckles then peg into the ground at the other end.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Suction clamp</strong> method (not included) - there are 3x semi-circle gaps in the pole sleeve to allow for clamps to attach to the metal of the pole inside. These are then attached to suction clamps which can attach to any part of the vehicle roof.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Will it fit my van height?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">sheltaPod is incredibly flexible when it comes to attachment methods. Our customers have attached sheltaPod to a wide range of vehicles from teardrop trailers to Tuktuk's!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">BLACKOUT/HEAT REFLECTIVE CANOPY</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">To help campers sleep better and stay cooler, we have designed this Blackout/Heat Reflective Canopy which clips easily onto the outside of the Pod tent in under 30 seconds.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This can also stop prying eyes looking in at any gear you have stored while you are away. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504303706/kbpoc9gayleudr8vnyl2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Disclaimer</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We tried this product on an extremely windy day for testing (winds in excess of 25MPH). Although sheltaPod held up well, it does tend to sway from side to side. To reduce this you must use more guy lines and we have provided six pre-attached guy lines and six additional guy lines for your use.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Also in windy conditions the sun canopy can act like a giant sail. This puts extra stress on the material and may cause damage to the sheltaPod. <strong>Therefore we strongly recommend that you detach the sun canopy from the vehicle, gather up the fabric and clip above the door of the Pod tent. Make sure you have used all the pre-attached guy lines to make sure that the Pod tent stays upright on it's own. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In heavy rain, water can pool on the sun canopy and create a leak around the area where the awning attaches to the van.

The half dome tent can concertina up to a simple sun canopy. This allows for unrestricted views of the beautiful countryside. But when the weather turns bad, we can quickly unhook the tiebacks clips and fold the tent down again.
INSTANT shelter from the wind and rain....WITHIN SECONDS! 

When sheltaPod is folded down it creates a sheltered area for cooking and dining. When it's time for bed, a separate inner tent with integrated groundsheet can be clipped into the rainfly. 
sheltaPod is the ONLY awning that can actually adapt to changing weather
 
     

 
APRIL 2018 UPDATE
We have now sold out of the blue colour and expect to be completely out of stock by the end of May 2018. The lead time with our factory is four months so it's too late to order another batch for this European/USA summer. However sheltaPod is proving very popular and so we want to offer even more stock and colours for spring 2019.  Please help us by pre-ordering now for the blue colour and get us to our stretch funding goal of
$180,000
Once reached, we'll be able to place an even bigger order with our factory and expand our colour range. THANK YOU

Also included is an Inner Tent with integrated groundsheet for sleeping (double airbed fits easily inside)
 
            
 

A separate waterproof front panel clips into the Pod entrance and provides secure storage when you don't want to use the inner tent. And there's a central zip for easy access. This is ideal for overnight storage or drive away.

ACCESSORIES
We also include Privacy 'side' Panels and a Rainfly Groundsheet.
The panels will be colour matched to the orange, blue or grey sheltaPod and works just like a windbreaker. It also offers campers a bit more privacy on busy campsites as well as stability to the telescopic poles they attach to.
              
 
             
The rainfly groundsheet is design to be used on rough ground or when campers want to keep their gear dry. It's shaped to fit the rainfly base perfectly and clips easily onto the existing rainfly tent pegs. Ideal for when the user doesn't want to use the inner tent but can be left in place if the inner tent is used...and provides even more ground protection. 

We've also added another mesh panel & curtain into the inner tent for camping in hot climates and if there are lots of bugs around. Now you have extra ventilation on those hot sticky nights without the worry of being bitten to death!
               
 
OUR STORY SO FAR....
In May 2017 we shipped around 320 sheltaPod awnings to our Indiegogo backers. We then started selling the remaining stock of 180 on our website and SOLD OUT in just TWO months. We now have sheltaPod's all over the world from Alaska to Sri Lanka which is just AWESOME!
             
2018
For 2018, we're introduced a more neutral grey colour and useful accessories to our product range. We've also made some improvements to the design based on our customer feedback.  

 
SEE SHELTAPOD ON THE ROAD

           

 

 
               
 
             
 
         Featured in:
               
sheltaPod is a half dome tent combined with a sun canopy which attaches to the side of the vehicle. But unlike many other campervan awnings, there are no side panels to block the light or obscure your views.
                 
The arched pole sections retract back to create a simple sun canopy then fold down again to a tent you can sleep in. 
              

 
                 
ATTACHMENT METHODS
                 
For campervans with an awning rail there is the gutter rail option (A) where a pole slides into the pole sleeve and then clamps securely in place (please note that the pole and clamps are not supplied with sheltaPod). There is also a bending strip that threads into the C channel (B). If you want to drive away then you also need a Kador strip and figure of eight which can been seen in the photo but does not come with sheltaPod. However we do supply 4 x five meter webbing straps for 'over the top' attachment (C) and you will also see three velcro straps that can attach to roof bars/racks. And finally you can use suction clamps (D) (not supplied) that attach to the pole in the pole sleeve. This is suitable for flat roof vehicles.
No campervan. No worries! sheltaPod can attach to almost any vehicle using the adjustable webbing/buckle straps included in the bag.
                  
                  
                  
sheltaPod can also attach to the tailgate of your vehicle if you want better access to the boot space. Perfect for getting changed before and after a days hiking, swimming, cycling, scuba diving, surfing.....you name it! 
                  
 
              
          

 
sheltaPod is a stylish and versatile campervan awning that can adapt to the changing weather. 

Gather up the fabric in each section and clip it to the pole sleeves. Each pole sleeve has several buckles/hoops so they can be clipped against each other. Also on each side of the door there are windbreaker panels which can be tied back when not needed.

If it starts to rain it's easy to extend the canopy and get more cover. Drop down one or two sections if you still want to enjoy the views. Drop down all the sections, peg into the ground and extend the windbreaker panels for complete shelter. 

The Pod section provides space for cooking and dining that's out of the wind and rain. It's also great for extra storage for camping equipment, bicycles, surf/diving wetsuits, etc. Just clip in the front panel and your gear is protected.

 

 

If you want more comfort you can clip in the inner tent. This offers extra sleeping space with a mesh panel that gives a view through to the PVC skylight window on the rainfly. Great for stargazing! But if you want to avoid the harsh daylight of the morning, there's a clip in curtain you can use.

DRIVE-AWAY

 Please watch the video below to see how sheltaPod works in Drive-away mode.



Not got any wheels!
sheltaPod can also be used as a Stand Alone Tent. Perfect as a fishing/angling/beach shelter.



 

 
sheltaPod offers a good compromise between size and ease of set up. Just how much space do we really need when we have a campervan next door! Realistically all we need is somewhere to cook and eat outside the van. And the inner tent provides additional sleeping for three adults/two adults & two children which should be enough for family and friends.

 


 
sheltaPod has gone through many redesigns and prototypes. We tried putting a door on the outer rainfly but direct tensioning on the poles made it difficult to zip up once inside the half-dome tent. Eventually we introduced a separate front panel as the best way of protecting gear when not using the inner tent.  We also redesigned the pole connection system for the rainfly, the inner tent connection method and how it attaches to the van. 
Each of our FIVE prototypes were fully field tested and redesigned if necessary. All the photos and video on this campaign page show the final 'fully working' pre-production sheltaPod. It is ready for mass production, which is where you come in. There is a minimum order quantity on each colour and so the minimum order is 700 awnings. This is why we are crowdfunding, we need to raise a minimum of $60,000 to get sheltaPod into it's first production run and onto campsites by spring 2017. 


 

 
""After viewing this at Camper Calling I'm very very impressed, good quality ...one of the best designs I've ever seen, go for it and back it"" Jason W
""It really is an amazing piece of kit. So versatile and well thought out and the quality is high. I saw Julie several times at Camper Calling and she has totally developed this project and taken comments on board.  There is nothing else like this on the market!"" Tracey K
""Great product, well thought out. I can't wait to be using one early next year""  Chris C
""It was great to see sheltaPod in the flesh after reading so much about it. It looks great, good quality and really versatile. I was impressed with the packed size and how light it is, as this was one thing I wasn't sure about. Although I've already got an awning and a sun canopy, I can see this offers something a bit different, quirky and stylish, but practical""  Deborah G
""Saw sheltaPod at Camper Calling and loved it, we don't like awnings because of losing the easy access of the sliding door area! So use a canopy and a little tent for storage... So for us this couldn't be better!!! Great product and lovely people. Wishing you luck"" X   Jo O

 

 
One of the unique features of sheltaPod is the big skylight windows. These let light flood in and are great for stargazing at night. But if it gets too hot and you want some shade, just clip in the separate curtain panels. Each skylight window has it's own curtain so you can choose how much shade you want.

Pre-attached guy lines with velcro tie backs for your convenience.

Pack size - 90cm x 30cm x 20cm
Pack weight - 11 kgs
Solo pitching time - 10-15 minutes



 

 
Solo set up time is 10 - 15mins (rainfly only). Check out our video on how it's done.


 


 
We want sheltaPod to attach to most types of vehicle, not just camper vans with awning rails. This is why we have incorporated FIVE different attachment methods:
C Channel - using 'figure of 8' and Kador strip (not included) into awning rail
J Rail & Pole Sleeve - Insert pole (not included) into the pole sleeve and then place into J/gutter rail. Use two butterfly clips (not included) to clamp in place at each end where the pole sticks out.
FOR ATTACHING TO SUV's/JEEPS/VANS WITH NO AWNING RAIL
Velcro straps - 3 x velcro double straps allow for attachment to roof/roll bars and roof racks. The hoop sided velcro strap is 14cm and the loop side is 14cm...total 28cm. This provides enough velcro to go around a maximum width bar of 24cm.
Webbing straps with release buckles - 4x webbing straps in total, 2x are designed to pull the awning taut over the top of the van, then 2x at the side to tension the awning front and back. This is to reduce sideways movement. We supply separate 5 x 5 metre long adjustable webbing straps. They attach to awning using release buckles then peg into the ground at the other end.
Suction clamp method (not included) - there are 3x semi-circle gaps in the pole sleeve to allow for clamps to attach to the metal of the pole inside. These are then attached to suction clamps which can attach to any part of the vehicle roof.
Will it fit my van height?
sheltaPod is incredibly flexible when it comes to attachment methods. Our customers have attached sheltaPod to a wide range of vehicles from teardrop trailers to Tuktuk's!
Here's sheltaPod attached to a hightop panel van. 
 
sheltaPod can attach to a wide variety of vehicles, caravan's and trailers.

 

 

These will only be added to our crowdfunding campaign once we reach the Stretch Goal for each accessory (see earlier diagram)
BLACKOUT/HEAT REFLECTIVE CANOPY
To help campers sleep better and stay cooler, we have designed this Blackout/Heat Reflective Canopy which clips easily onto the outside of the Pod tent in under 30 seconds.
This can also stop prying eyes looking in at any gear you have stored while you are away. 

 
Disclaimer
We tried this product on an extremely windy day for testing (winds in excess of 25MPH). Although sheltaPod held up well, it does tend to sway from side to side. To reduce this you must use more guy lines and we have provided six pre-attached guy lines and six additional guy lines for your use.
Also in windy conditions the sun canopy can act like a giant sail. This puts extra stress on the material and may cause damage to the sheltaPod. Therefore we strongly recommend that you detach the sun canopy from the vehicle, gather up the fabric and clip above the door of the Pod tent. Make sure you have used all the pre-attached guy lines to make sure that the Pod tent stays upright on it's own. 
In heavy rain, water can pool on the sun canopy and create a leak around the area where the awning attaches to the van. To reduce this problem, lower one of the vertical poles so that the canopy slopes to one side. The water will then easily run off. Also make sure you have placed the horizontal crossbar into the sun canopy between the two telescopic poles. This creates an apex which allows the rain to run off.
sheltaPod like most tents is NOT fire resistant. Therefore do not place hot appliances near the wall, roof or curtains. Please follow the Fire Precautions advice provided.
sheltaPod campervan awning is NOT designed for winter/extreme conditions. It is a spring/summer/autumn product. 
Pricing
Perks are shown in USD. This is because Indiegogo can only accept PayPal payments in other currencies. But they can accept both PayPal AND credit cards if the perks are in USD. We chose USD because we want our backers to have both options.
* Prices will vary depending on the current GBP/USD exchange rate.
Perks
When you back us, not only will you get a sheltaPod campervan awning as a perk. You will be backing the creation of a new company - sheltaCamp Ltd - whose aim will be to bring innovative and stylish products into the campervan awnings/accessories market. We want to offer a wide range of colours and customisations to sheltaPod, as well as useful assessories.

The inner tent may become an extra when they eventually go on sale because we recognise that some people want the option to buy just the rainfly (which includes the front panel and curtains). But for our Indiegogo campaign we are including it as part of our perks.
If you feel our perk amounts are not very competitive against similar products currently in the campervan awnings market, we ask that you consider the following:

    •    sheltaPod is currently manufactured and shipped in smaller quantities, so we're not able to compete with the bigger awning companies on price point but we definitely hope to in the future.
Also we currently don't include VAT but at some point we will have to add this when we reach the threshold. At that point the sheltaPod RRP will increase to £295 but this will only reflect the amount we have to pay in VAT.
Returns Policy
We do not offer refunds or returns on sheltaPod campervan awnings that were received as an Indiegogo perk.
Crowdfunding is an amazing tool that allows people to get their ideas off the ground.

If one of the poles is faulty we can send you a replacement. We must be notified within 28 days from the receiving date of your awning. 
Exclusions: cosmetic defects i.e: loose threads or gaps in seam tape, wear and tear, condensation, dragging, abuse or misuse, accidents, falling objects, improper set up, burn holes, extreme weather or damage caused by insects, animals or children.
Please remember that this is the early stages of a new product and therefore there will be a few issues that will need to be ironed out.

We're also working with a very experienced manufacturer and have excellent advisors around us. We've been developing sheltaPod for over 20 months.

However in the meantime, if you are from one of these countries, would love a sheltaPod but can’t pay the postage then reach out to us and if we get enough of you then we can significantly lower these costs and refund you the difference.

We’ve spent years developing and refining the idea, and we’ve worked extremely hard to get the product ready for Indiegogo, so we’re not prepared to execute it poorly. In our last crowdfunding campaign we exceeded all expectations, with a record-beating production run. Fulfilling it made us better at what we do than ever before, nevertheless, every project has risks - here are the big three:</p><h3>MANUFACTURING</h3><p>When man meets machine, things can go wrong, but we have six years’ experience in manufacturing the tent and have developed robust contingency plans for all eventualities. Our long-term relationships with trusted manufacturers means that we can rely on their excellence in quality, speed and flexibility and to double down on checks, members of the Cinch team personally oversee all the most important stages of the manufacturing process.</p><h3>PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS</h3><p>One of the things that makes the Cinch special is attention to detail, as we aim to make each edition as near-perfect as we can. As such we make minor adjustments to the design as production goes forward and though this can set our timescale back, our philosophy is that we'd rather bring you the very best product possible than rush things. This year's developments are, as always, supported by the Cinch community and sit on top of an already-incredible tent - check out the 2017 feedback for yourself. If we see the opportunity to improve the tent in any area we'll let you know exactly how, when and why these changes will be made and how (if at all) they will affect the timeline. </p><h3>FULFILMENT</h3><p>2017 was our biggest year yet and, in terms of production, every day was a school day. We learned an enormous amount about spreadsheet gremlins, customs fees, lost shipments and much more. We bring all of this knowledge to bear from the beginning of this project - and boy are we glad. Unpredictable situations - a supplier missing a deadline, a breakdown of machinery, a change of customs law - are all things that can cause a delay. To minimise the possibility of any setbacks, we have a team of people ready to step in to a situation, we have backup factories at the ready, and we always have a personal contact for you, so that you can follow the project all the way through to your door.</p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519328638/wj6lm1szp2zrvcr1smo1.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><p><strong><i>What comes with my tent?</i> </strong></p><p>A lot! The Cinch comes equipped with an inner and outer LED lighting system, light reflective guys, canopy setup (though not the extended canopy), torches, mirrors and all the Cinch smarts. We’re even throwing in a free Climate Control Canopy for Indiegogo-ers. However, other items, such as the solar power pack, are sold separately. We totally recommend it, but some people prefer to camp without it and we want people to camp how they want to.</p><p><strong><i>Is the tent waterproof?</i> </strong></p><p>It certainly is! One of the problems with disposable pop up tents is that they’re quite flimsy and prone to leak in the rain. The Cinch has a Hydrostatic Head (HH) rating of 4000, four times the industry standard for waterproofing. It isn’t just the HH rating that keeps a tent waterproof though and so we’ve equipped the Cinch with double-taped heat-sealed seams and a complete groundsheet system (with a HH rating of 12000!).</p><p>Unlike most pop-up tents the Cinch is also double-skinned, meaning that there are two layers of fabric between you and the outside world. When the rain comes this means that the outer layer doesn’t have to contend with any condensation coming from inside the tent and this really helps keep everything nice and dry.</p><p><strong><i>How does the tent do in the wind?</i></strong></p><p>""Our faithful Cinch has got us through the long night of wind and rain. It has taken a battering in the wind all day. Definitely our top purchase of 2017.”</p><p>We’ve added extra pegging points along the base - combine these with the extra guy ropes and you can really fasten the Cinch to the ground and get ready for the worst the wind has to throw at you.</p><p><strong><i>Is the tent difficult to fold up?</i></strong></p><p>Pop up tents huh? Everyone has a story of being bested by a pop up – the primitive noises, the incandescent rage. Stuffed into the boot of the car and taken home to be burned for all time and ever. We’re putting an end to those stories. There’s definitely a knack to putting the Cinch down but once you’ve got it it’s an, ahem, Cinch! Our 2018 model features a colour coded takedown system and we’ve even added a little wiggle room in the bag so you don’t have to Schwarzenegger it back in and we’re with you all the way with videos and instructions. </p><p><strong><i>Is there mosquito/fly netting?</i></strong></p><p>Our 2018 Cinch pop-up is completely impregnable to beasties, featuring a double-groundsheet system, meshed vents and dual-screen doors. You can let in as much of the outdoors as you like whilst keeping safe from creatures great and small. </p><p><strong><i>Can you stand up in the tents?</i></strong></p><p>That depends how tall you are. Pop-up Tents in general aren’t necessarily designed for campers to stand up in, however our tents are very spacious and have plenty of head room. Below are the height sizes for each of the tents. Depending on your height, you may be able to stand in the four man. </p><p>2 Man                      1.15m<br/>3 Man                      1.2m<br/>4 Man                      1.6m</p><p>You CAN, however, stand up in the new Cinch POD! One of the motivations for designing it was to provide you with a place to stand up tall and survey your land. </p><p><strong><i>How many guy lines do I need to peg out?</i></strong></p><p>As many as you need. There are 20 guy lines available on the tent, so if there’s no wind, just peg the tent base and you’re ready to go. We advise that you peg the guy lines out according to the weather: if it’s windy, you can peg out all 20 guy lines to really stabilise your tent</p><p><strong><i>Is the Cinch a four season tent?</i></strong></p><p>A ‘four season’ or ‘winter’ tent is a tent that is prepared to tackle heavy snowfalls and wind and this is typically achieved with an extra-rigid exoskeleton and steeply angled sides. The things that allow these tents to cope in extreme conditions also make the tent a lot bulkier and heavier and this isn’t the way we’ve gone with our design. However, whilst we’d only recommend specialist equipment in truly extreme conditions, the Cinch is equipped for some really bad weather – with a HH rating of 4000, double taped seams, an extra-thick bathtub style groundsheet, extra pegging points and guy ropes galore it’s ready for all but the very worst stuff. Note also that a four season tent doesn’t provide especial protection against cold weather – most of your warmth comes from other equipment like your sleeping bag, your mat and your clothing.  </p><p><strong><i>Does the tent come with the Solar Power Pack or is it an added extra?</i></strong></p><p>We totally recommend the Solar Power Pack but some people would rather camp without it and so we sell the two separately.</p><p><strong><i>Can you use the extended canopy on both sides of the tent?</i></strong></p><p>The extended canopy is compatible with either entrance to the tent, which means you can choose which end to set up in. Though you’re free to add an extended canopy to both ends of the tent, we only really recommend having one because you’ll struggle to use the solar power pack and you’ll cover a few too many of the guy lines.</p><p><strong><i>Is the tent suitable for backpacking or bike touring?</i></strong></p><p>This is entirely up to you and how you envisage your trip. The weight and bulk of your equipment can be paramount to your packing concerns and we recommend that you take some time to envisage how you might incorporate the Cinch into your setup, the weight you think you’re capable of carrying comfortably and whether the rewards the tent offers are worth the extra weight (they are). Customers who have managed to fit the Cinch into their pack (or their group’s pack) say that it pays back in comfort, features and convenience. </p><p><strong><i>Why isn’t it a four-woman tent?</i></strong></p><p>Unfortunately, as a small company, we’re at the mercy of search engine returns and that means we have to market our products using the industry’s accepted terminology. We definitely think it’s time for a change though and we’ll be looking to become more person-able as we become better known.</p></div>","It's been a beautiful campaign!

 Meet the pop-up tent that has revolutionised camping, making it smarter, cooler and hassle free. Our fourth-generation CINCH! POP-UP has everything that has made it such a crowdfunding favourite and much, much more. In 2018, industry-leading quality, world-beating hugeness and technological innovation are joined by a dozen user-inspired design changes including…

Panoramic inner doors, allowing you to use every inch of the inner tent space as your living area
A completely enclosed groundsheet, meaning every Cinch is no-bug zone

Smartphone controlled interior LED lighting system
 Our newest innovation is a super-versatile pop up living area that provides standing room for the tallest of campers, multi-tent connectivity, solar power mounting, heat regulation and LED lighting. A place to stretch out, relax and share some time, it pitches in seconds and makes any campsite a home. Perfect for completing the Cinch campsite setup, or even as a standalone retreat for beach-trips or live events. This year’s solar power pack is true world-beater, pulling enough juice from the sun to power your most demanding gadgets.

CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY Pulling in a whopping 21 watts of power, our panels are strong and smart enough to charge your USB gadgets straight from the sun, with innovative technology allowing the panel to manage environmental conditions and deliver the best charge.

BIG POWER Our portable power pack punches in at 13,000MAH - the equivalent of six full iPhone 7 charges. It comes with fast charging technology, 2 regular USB and even a type C port, ready for the latest laptops and phones.

COMPLETE INTEGRATION All-new rooftop ports store the solar panel inside the tent, keeping it dry, secure and accessible. With no need for external ports, your Cinch is 100% sealed off from the outside world. Higher power pockets in the inner tent also mean shorter wires and much less fiddling.
 ‘KEEPS THE KIDS IN BETTER MOODS WITH BETTER SLEEP’ - Customer SurveySimmering Summer seasons are what camping is all about - if only it wasn’t for the hot, stuffy, airless mornings that leave you feeling like a bowl of lobster bisque. Fear not: our Climate Control Canopy spells the end of the 6AM stickies. This lightweight radiant barrier stretches easily over the tent, leaving your interior significantly cooler and deliciously darker - perfect for a refreshing morning lie in, a place to chill in the afternoon, or even a creche for baby camps. The two sides of this year’s Climate Control Canopy provide extra-strength cover against the elements - keep it cooler with the silver or dim the lights with the dark side. Our new colour coded takedown system means that packing up the Cinch is easier than ever. It's down within a minute, you don't need to be Hulk Hogan and we're with you all the way with how-to videos. You no longer have to compromise on space - The Cinch holds the title for world's biggest pop up, pushing the boundaries in two, three and four people berths. Our huge internal living area is even bigger this year, with the addition of widescreen doors, allowing you to utilise every square centimetre of living space. Add that to the two large entranceways which double up as storage areas, pockets galore, two windows and a completely enclosed groundsheet and you have the most versatile pop-up on the planet. A standing tent can be packed down inside a minute-and-half into a disc-shaped rucksack, ready for the road. Full specifications below.Night time is just as important as day when you’re camping, and just as fun. That’s why we’ve kitted out the Cinch with a complete exterior lighting system and - NEW FOR 2018 - Interior LED. Lining the ceiling of the inner tent, our LED setup sparkles, glints and illuminates in 365 colours at the touch of a smartphone. Can’t find your tent in the dark on the way back home? Illuminate it! Need to set the mood for romance? Phone it in! On the outside you can expect LED tent pegs and light-reflective guylines and the complete lighting system is made even-more-complete by the addition of two pop up lanterns which can be hung from numerous points around the tent.The Cinch brings the weatherproofing prowess of high spec dome tent to the world of the pop up for the first time. Check out our feedback below to see front-line reports of the Cinch in action.
Double-skinned to prevent condensation
Fully enclosed groundsheet means that the outside stays outside - no bugs, no sand, no water.
Double-taped heat-sealed seams prevent damp
Outer layer is made from 4000HH fabric – three-times the industry standard in waterproofing
Cinch ventilation system creates continual circulation of fresh air, without compromising on insulation.
We’ve spent almost a decade perfecting our pop-up and this year is no different. The 2018 Cinch  features refinements inspired by our fabulous crowdfunders and the way they camp plus design expertise plus plus inspiration. Here’s some of this year’s biggest changes:Size was our first consideration when designing the Cinch range. Why should you have to compromise on space, for the convenience of a pop-up? Why not have both? Our tents have a huge internal living area, with two large porches that double up as storage areas. The tent then packs down into a disc-shaped rucksack containing the complete kit and, weighing in at just 7kg for the 2-man Cinch. Cook, eat or relax outside your tent whilst sheltering from the elements, with the optional extended canopy.
Increases space by a further 75%
Folds down into a small carry bag
Lightweight and Waterproof
Comes with a charming little light
  So what's a footprint? It's a separate groundsheet that's cut-to-size that you place underneath your Cinch! to provide extra protection. It means that you can pack your tent away without the base being dirty, meaning you don't have to take the campsite home with you and extending your tent's lifespan. It's much easier to clean and less fiddly than unpacking and wiping down your tent when you get home. It's not essential by any means – but it's a great extra, and we introduced it after lots of requests from our backers.There are so many ways to camp - a day on the beach, roadtrip roughing it on the side of the highway, a weeklong family get-together or the complete Glastonbury experience - all require different setups. Our complete kit prepares you for every one of them, with adventure-proof combinations ready to go whenever you are.Take the POD to keep out of the sun when you’re lakeside, mix the Cinch with the extended canopy for a week in Provence or connect your gang’s Cinches together with the HUB for the ultimate festival base camp.

Our 2018 model features a colour coded takedown system and we’ve even added a little wiggle room in the bag so you don’t have to Schwarzenegger it back in and we’re with you all the way with videos and instructions. Is there mosquito/fly netting?Our 2018 Cinch pop-up is completely impregnable to beasties, featuring a double-groundsheet system, meshed vents and dual-screen doors. You can let in as much of the outdoors as you like whilst keeping safe from creatures great and small. Can you stand up in the tents?That depends how tall you are. Pop-up Tents in general aren’t necessarily designed for campers to stand up in, however our tents are very spacious and have plenty of head room. Below are the height sizes for each of the tents. Depending on your height, you may be able to stand in the four man. 2 Man                      1.15m3 Man                      1.2m4 Man                      1.6mYou CAN, however, stand up in the new Cinch POD! One of the motivations for designing it was to provide you with a place to stand up tall and survey your land. How many guy lines do I need to peg out?As many as you need. There are 20 guy lines available on the tent, so if there’s no wind, just peg the tent base and you’re ready to go. We advise that you peg the guy lines out according to the weather: if it’s windy, you can peg out all 20 guy lines to really stabilise your tentIs the Cinch a four season tent?A ‘four season’ or ‘winter’ tent is a tent that is prepared to tackle heavy snowfalls and wind and this is typically achieved with an extra-rigid exoskeleton and steeply angled sides. The things that allow these tents to cope in extreme conditions also make the tent a lot bulkier and heavier and this isn’t the way we’ve gone with our design. However, whilst we’d only recommend specialist equipment in truly extreme conditions, the Cinch is equipped for some really bad weather – with a HH rating of 4000, double taped seams, an extra-thick bathtub style groundsheet, extra pegging points and guy ropes galore it’s ready for all but the very worst stuff. Note also that a four season tent doesn’t provide especial protection against cold weather – most of your warmth comes from other equipment like your sleeping bag, your mat and your clothing.  Does the tent come with the Solar Power Pack or is it an added extra?We totally recommend the Solar Power Pack but some people would rather camp without it and so we sell the two separately.Can you use the extended canopy on both sides of the tent?The extended canopy is compatible with either entrance to the tent, which means you can choose which end to set up in. Though you’re free to add an extended canopy to both ends of the tent, we only really recommend having one because you’ll struggle to use the solar power pack and you’ll cover a few too many of the guy lines.Is the tent suitable for backpacking or bike touring?This is entirely up to you and how you envisage your trip. The weight and bulk of your equipment can be paramount to your packing concerns and we recommend that you take some time to envisage how you might incorporate the Cinch into your setup, the weight you think you’re capable of carrying comfortably and whether the rewards the tent offers are worth the extra weight (they are). Customers who have managed to fit the Cinch into their pack (or their group’s pack) say that it pays back in comfort, features and convenience. Why isn’t it a four-woman tent?Unfortunately, as a small company, we’re at the mercy of search engine returns and that means we have to market our products using the industry’s accepted terminology. We definitely think it’s time for a change though and we’ll be looking to become more person-able as we become better known.",54.0,0,"2 Campaigns

We would like to fill all the cities around the world of a new eco-friendly vehicle with pedal assisted electric motors! 
We're making the frame that will be universal (compatible) with many types of bodies (that's why it's ""mutant"":)), we will start with an old style three weels Morgan  bodywork, but many others have already been designed:

I'm an Architect and Designer with experience in mechanic design.
It's pure passion for a different way to imagine our ""short city travels"" and commuting.

The average speed in the city is about 10 km/h, with an electric-pedal assisted veichle the top speed is of 25km/h, they aren't bulky, without pollution and fun!

Remember when you were younger and your parents bought you that one toy that you really loved? That one toy that you didn't want anyone else to play with? 



You didn't want anyone else to have it so much that you tried to hide it from public. You would hold it in your hands and admire it all to yourself. 


Now that I think of it... It sounds like I'm describing Gollum from Lord of the Rings.



What you felt when you were younger is what you will feel when you hold the LYPEN in your hands. Everything from the weight & feel of the pen to how it looks in person will leave you itching to keep it in your hands. 



Hi guys, 



My name is Mark Anthony and by day I'm a Full-time watchmaker for Swiss brands & by night I'm a Full-time martial arts instructor. 



From putting together pen designs that I liked & eliminating things I didn't like, I came up with the LYPEN. 



When I first brought home the prototype, my girlfriend had to threaten me with the you-know-what while going to bed because I didn't want to part with it.






STRONG & INDESTRUCTIBLE - MADE OUT OF A SOLID TITANIUM

I was sick and tired of the pens on the market. Flimsy & pathetic. If I did find a pen, there was something that I didn't like about it. I just couldn't find the perfect pen.
One thing was for sure, the foundation of the LYPEN was going to be Titanium.






The LYPEN is so strong that I'm able to suspend my whole weight on it (how many pull-ups can you do?...)



MINIMALISTIC & DISCREET- KEEPING IT STUPID SIMPLE

 

I'm a huge fan of minimalistic design. I didn't want a pen that screamed out at me. I needed something that felt luxurious but also sturdy.
I didn't want a BMW car that ran on a Volkswagen Beetle Engine. I needed something that looked and lived up to it's name.

When we were preparing to migrate to USA, we thought we would be going to the capitol of USA Washington DC, we did not know that there was another state, Washing state but knew our final destination was Seattle. At the end of our 12 hour flight we landed on the land of opportunity and our life was back to the starting point again but this time everything was new, high rise buildings that we never saw before, multiple freeway lanes and we stood there alone. We found peace in ourselves knowing that more than 300 million people call this home and sure we could find our place as well.  During our 14 years of living in USA we have had our fair share of the ups and down in our life. I have been laid off 4 times and my wife once in the name of restructuring, downsizing, moving the corporate office and recession but we never lost living, taking care of our monthly financial commitments and believed from day one that all this is temporary and better days are yet to come. We see that vision in our Empowerment Bottle product and will work towards our goal tirelessly to achieve it. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/442812/files/20140318124804-Water_bottle_in_multiple_views.jpg?1395172084"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/442814/files/20140318124846-Water_bottle_new_handle_metal_end_design.jpg?1395172126"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/442822/files/20140318125204-Water_bottle_design_with_parts_label_for_kickstarter.jpg?1395172324"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 284px;""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Every day, millions of people feel insecure walking in their own neighborhoods or going about their business. I am a King County Metro bus driver. One night, while I was driving my regular route, a female passenger disembarked and asked if I could wait there with the bus until she got to her car. It was only eight in the evening. Later, I saw a female university student run from my bus to her apartment. I drove slowly to be sure I could see her get home safely, but it didn't seem like enough.</p><p>It really got me thinking. What is the world coming to if women can’t even feel safe enough to walk from a bus to their car?</p><p>We bus drivers deal with various safety concerns on our routes. All transit operators have at some point been thrust into a fearful situation where we have to protect our self and our passengers, but what about our passengers when they’re no longer on the bus? I wondered what I could do to provide people in transit with a protective tool that would make them feel safe, something they can carry with them easily—maybe something they already carry with them!</p><p>A water bottle instantly came to mind. People carry water bottles all the time—during exercise, hiking, going places alone, on their way home from work or to work, in their bag, or even by their side while sleeping.</p><p>Water bottles also help reduce the amount of waste people produce, making them better for our environment. So, I decided to design a fully functional water bottle with built-in tools for self-defense.</p><p><b>Ultimately, I want to give the gift of security and self-confidence to people who fear potential attackers.</b> I discussed the idea with family members, friends, and coworkers, and, after receiving positive responses, I decided to bring my idea to Indiegogo.</p><p><b>Experience Empowerment’s Design.</b>The Empowerment Bottle is made of single-wall food-grade 304 stainless steel, and can hold 16 ounces of water. <b>But the true purpose of its design is hidden inside:</b> aside from being a fully functional water bottle that will keep your drinking water cool throughout the day, it has a <b>spring-loaded 2 ounce pepper spray canister</b> and a <b>piercing warning whistle</b> built into it. On the handle, there is a <b>metal piece</b> attached, which can be used to strike your attacker if you are unable to use the pepper spray or whistle. And for night time visibility attached is a reflective tape. </p><p>As shown in the prototype schematics below, the pepper spray and whistle are stored next to the water canister in a square chamber that is totally sealed off from the water container, and are accessible in a second to the bottle’s carrier.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/448018/files/20140320125236-Bottle_design_3-17.jpg?1395345156"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>The tools in this bottle are specifically made and included to give <b>everyone who carries an Empowerment Bottle the feeling of positive energy and safety that will allow them to live a freer, happier life.  </b></p><p>The Empowerment Bottle is lined with a BPA-free plastic, so there is no metallic aftertaste.

Indo-Fijians are Fijians whose ancestors came from India and various parts of South Asia and South-East Asia.They are mostly descended from indentured laborers, girmitiyas or girmit, brought to the islands by Fiji's British colonial rulers between 1879 and 1916 to work on Fiji's sugar cane plantations.Our life changed when the first coup happened in Fiji in 1987 and that put Fiji back by 30 years and lots of hardship made us take  the opportunity to migrate to USA. When we were preparing to migrate to USA, we thought we would be going to the capitol of USA Washington DC, we did not know that there was another state, Washing state but knew our final destination was Seattle. At the end of our 12 hour flight we landed on the land of opportunity and our life was back to the starting point again but this time everything was new, high rise buildings that we never saw before, multiple freeway lanes and we stood there alone. We found peace in ourselves knowing that more than 300 million people call this home and sure we could find our place as well.  During our 14 years of living in USA we have had our fair share of the ups and down in our life. I have been laid off 4 times and my wife once in the name of restructuring, downsizing, moving the corporate office and recession but we never lost living, taking care of our monthly financial commitments and believed from day one that all this is temporary and better days are yet to come. We see that vision in our Empowerment Bottle product and will work towards our goal tirelessly to achieve it. Every day, millions of people feel insecure walking in their own neighborhoods or going about their business. I am a King County Metro bus driver. One night, while I was driving my regular route, a female passenger disembarked and asked if I could wait there with the bus until she got to her car. It was only eight in the evening. Later, I saw a female university student run from my bus to her apartment. I drove slowly to be sure I could see her get home safely, but it didn't seem like enough.It really got me thinking. What is the world coming to if women can’t even feel safe enough to walk from a bus to their car?We bus drivers deal with various safety concerns on our routes. All transit operators have at some point been thrust into a fearful situation where we have to protect our self and our passengers, but what about our passengers when they’re no longer on the bus? I wondered what I could do to provide people in transit with a protective tool that would make them feel safe, something they can carry with them easily—maybe something they already carry with them!A water bottle instantly came to mind. People carry water bottles all the time—during exercise, hiking, going places alone, on their way home from work or to work, in their bag, or even by their side while sleeping.Water bottles also help reduce the amount of waste people produce, making them better for our environment. So, I decided to design a fully functional water bottle with built-in tools for self-defense.Ultimately, I want to give the gift of security and self-confidence to people who fear potential attackers. I discussed the idea with family members, friends, and coworkers, and, after receiving positive responses, I decided to bring my idea to Indiegogo.Experience Empowerment’s Design.The Empowerment Bottle is made of single-wall food-grade 304 stainless steel, and can hold 16 ounces of water. But the true purpose of its design is hidden inside: aside from being a fully functional water bottle that will keep your drinking water cool throughout the day, it has a spring-loaded 2 ounce pepper spray canister and a piercing warning whistle built into it. On the handle, there is a metal piece attached, which can be used to strike your attacker if you are unable to use the pepper spray or whistle. And for night time visibility attached is a reflective tape. As shown in the prototype schematics below, the pepper spray and whistle are stored next to the water canister in a square chamber that is totally sealed off from the water container, and are accessible in a second to the bottle’s carrier.  The tools in this bottle are specifically made and included to give everyone who carries an Empowerment Bottle the feeling of positive energy and safety that will allow them to live a freer, happier life.  The Empowerment Bottle is lined with a BPA-free plastic, so there is no metallic aftertaste. Its ergonomic, compact shape is designed to fit in your hand and in every standard cup holder. The Empowerment Bottle is also leak-proof! It should be noted that the Empowerment Bottle is not dishwasher safe due to the pepper spray, but quick and easy hand-washing is perfectly safe for you and your bottle.  Where will the funds go?  The money raised from this will be primarily put toward constructing a working prototype from my schematics and 3-D animation. Working with prototype maker to enhance my design and bring out the best product that delivers top quality of everything it is designed to offer. Once I have a working prototype, it will go toward the production of the first run of Empowerment Bottles, including the bottles that will be given out to backers. I am reaching out to successful business entrepreneurs who have had great experience in the production of similar product and are willing to provide professional guidance and references.Please note that this type individual components
have not been packaged together in a bottle to date and this is truly a new
innovation we are developing.A portion of the funds will also go toward market research in order to determine how to best target my niche audience. I intend to move into entrepreneurship with the Empowerment Bottle, so I will also be putting funds toward business plan writing, marketing both the Empowerment Bottle and my business, website design and hosting, back-end maintenance, and going into business. To wrap all the above in a dollar amount, we are looking at approximately $17,500 to get started. I have already spent $5,000.00 to protect my design as patent pending, domain name, marks for logo, slogan and  bottle name, domain name and web development.It was designed in Washington and will be manufactured in China in consideration of reducing the cost of the bottle that will eventually be paid by the consumers.How much will the Empowerment Bottle cost? The final selling price of the Empowerment Bottle will be between $29.99 and $34.99 but it will largely depend on the production cost. Indiegogo backers have the opportunity to get one for $30 regardless of the final cost as your help means a lot to me, along with my thanks, website acknowledgment, and other merchandise, for helping me on the way to getting the Empowerment Bottle into the hands of people who need it.  Please check out the reward levels on the right to see how you can contribute !  Is the Empowerment Bottle patented? YesPatent pending receipt:Trademark, Logo and Slogan mark have also been submitted to the USPTO office for registrationFAQWhat about a warranty? Because the Empowerment Bottle contains moving parts, we are providing a one-year warranty.

Designed to adapt to your daily activities and carry needs. With superb organizational features, it combines top quality material, components and craftsmanship.A unique vertically integrated rolltop design to change the way you look and carry. A true balance and purity of form and function.   The X-PAK PRO:The larger of the two styles to fit up to a 13"" laptop, and organizational features to meet all your carry needs. With two independent compartments, and a capacity of 10L to 17L when expanded, the bag can be used for work, travel or for leisure. The ultimate all-arounder for the city and beyond. The X-PAK ONE:A more compact size from its bigger sibling, but packing numerous features in its smaller form. A highly versatile bag that can transform to your needs and lifestyle; from a shoulder bag, hand bag, waist pack to a bike pack. Volume capacity of 4L to 7L when expanded. COLOR OPTIONS -Choose from two color options, BLACK or WHITE, for both the X-PAK ONE and X-PAK PRO. Interior Lining/Fabric Color:For the interior fabric, we purposely chose brighter/lighter colors for our lining. While black tends to be the more common color, we took inspiration from the iconic MA-1 fighter pilot jacket (aka bomber jacket). An orange liner was used to help promote visibility during rescue missions in the event of a plane crash. While our bags are not reversible like the jackets, it may help to see your belongings better in the dark. X-PAK PRO FEATURES -The X-PAK PRO is the larger size of the two styles available. Packed with features in a clean, minimalistic design.  X-PAK ONE FEATURES -Don't let the smaller size fool you. The X-PAK ONE is a much more versatile bag than is bigger sibling. It can be carried over shoulder or cross-body, and via hand using the optional Handle Grip (see Add-On Details section), which is the same as the PRO. But, the X-PAK ONE can also be worn around your waist or convert to a bike pack using the optional Bike Strap (see Add-On Details section) as well, to become adapt to your lifestyle and needs.  ADD-ON DETAILS -1) External Compression Straps w/ Buckle Release PointsOur compression straps are designed specifically for use with the X-PAK collection to secure items outside of the bag. Such as yoga mats, camera tripods and more. Made using custom aluminum hooks, durable 0.75"" (20mm) nylon webbings and high quality buckles from ITW Nexus. 2) Removable Handle GripBesides the shoulder, both X-PAX PRO and X-PAX ONE are designed to be carried by hand using the detachable handle grip.The Handle Grip can be attached to the multi-purpose attach points that wraps around the main body of both X-PAK PRO and X-PAK ONE. 3) Bike Pack Strap KitThe X-PAK ONE can convert to a bicycle pack by attaching it to the handle bar using the Bike Pack Strap Kit.The velcro straps provide quick and easy process to attach the bag on the handle bar. In addition, the Stem Tube Strap gives a more secure fit with less movement while riding the bike. FEATURES & SPEC COMPARISON -Height Comparison:X-PAK PROX-PAK ONEExpands To Your Needs:Increase storage capacity for both X-PAK PRO and X-PAK ONE by expanding the outer shell (rolltop) to its maximum size. X-PAK PRO will add another 7L, while the X-PAK ONE will add 3L more. Multiple Configuration:By creating two separate compartments and integrating a foldable outer shell, the X-PAK can expand in size to meet your carry needs. And giving it three unique looks to fit your style, preference and carry needs. From a rolled/folded closure, center buckled or expanded for maximum capacity.  Feature Comparison:A side-by-side comparison of the key features and specs of the two models, X-PAK ONE and X-PAK PRO. MATERIAL & COMPONENT DETAILS -X-PAK's are built using top-grade materials and components from tried-and-tested industry leaders in their respective fields.The fabric used for the front outer shell compartment is produced in the USA. It is unique in that it is 4 layers laminated together instead of just one layer with PU coating, like many backpacks in the market. The layers are: DWR water repellant coating, woven nylon face fabric for abrasion resistance, X-Ply polyester yarn insert for bias stability and tear strength, clear film for waterproof and stretch control, and woven polyester backing for seam strength and durability.Also using high-quality YKK zippers and plastic parts, combined with ITW's modern, durable yet lightweight buckles. And the main body is constructed using a more rugged and abrasion resistant, 1680D ballistic nylon, which is similar to that of many travel luggages made of fabric (vs plastic casing). We carefully designed and sourced each and every aspect of our bags.At the same time, we did not want to ruin the aesthetics by unnecessary branding.

It’s a better sleep and a better pack.  After a long day of outdoor adventures, there’s nothing better than a good night’s sleep. Superior Hammock is a unique outdoor sleep system that uses the portability and cloud-like feel of a hammock combined with the insulation of a sleeping bag and the shelter of a tent.It adds hardly any weight to your pack and it’s super easy to set up. Superior Hammock guarantees great sleep in the great outdoors.Campers are always looking for ways to lighten their load and avoid lugging a tent around. Plus, sleeping right under the stars isn’t a bad deal. Problem is, most hammocks that enable you to do that don’t offer the insulation you need to actually stay warm throughout the night.Superior Hammock is actually designed for you to spend the night. No more lying on the cold, hard ground in a bulky tent. Superior Hammock is easy to use, portable, and insulated, keeping you warm and your pack lighter. Superior Hammock is easy and simple to set up.Step 1 : Pick your trees and wrap the straps around the trunks.Step 2 : Connect the carabiners to the straps and tighten for just the right amount of tension. And if you plan on using the tarp, simply connect it to the tarp extension. Step 3 : Stake down the sides of the shelter. And you’re ready to sleep!Check out this quick demonstration video showing how to set up: If you haven't been convinced yet, also take a look at our comparison video below. We compare the setup of traditional tent and Superior Hammock. Superior Hammock keeps you insulated throughout the night outdoors when temperatures can drop unexpectedly. One common problem with sleeping in a hammock outdoor is “Cold Butt Syndrome”. Sure, you can bring along underquilts or sleepings pads to help, but that just adds more fussing, time, weight and cold drafts. Superior Hammock solves this with the integrated 800 Fill premium down.And breathable, silk-like nylon fabric means you won’t wake up in the night sweating bullets either. It can be difficult to get a good night’s rest knowing that you are exposed to the outdoor pests. Our sheer Bug Net helps keep you fully protected yet still allows you to enjoy the view and atmosphere of the outdoors.                                             Depending on the weather, sleeping under the stars sometimes just isn’t an option. Superior Hammock works for any camping trip.Equipped with the handy shelter-tarp, you can use it even when it’s raining or snowing. This shelter can be used exactly like a standard hex tarp. Or it can be used as a super-quick, all-in-one setup attaching directly to the hammock suspension. This is when the setup gets insanely fast.Simply connect the tarp to the included heavy-duty strap extension and then stake the sides of the tarp into the ground. Set this bad boy up in a flash.We wanted to share our passion for the great outdoors with the world by creating the best sleeping gear that actually lasts. Superior Hammock can support up to 400lbs of weight and never let you down.                                             Tents are a pain to set up and once you do, you’re still basically just lying on the cold hard ground.Superior Hammock feels like you’re sleeping on a cloud.

<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1. How to select the 150m tether update?</strong></p>
<p>If you had pre-ordered the basic kit on Kickstarter early, but still want to upgrade the tether to 150m, just select the upgrade perk on Indiegogo at $299, we will upgrade it for you and ship it together with items you had ordered on Kickstarter.</p>
<p><strong>2. Does the drone automatically stabilize at the desired depth?</strong></p>
<p>Titan could stabilize at a certain depth if you hit the function button on the app.</p>
<p><strong>3. Do the thrusters work independently such that I can pitch the nose of the drone up and down?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the thrusters work independently and you can pitch the nose of the drone up and down.</p>
<p><strong>4. Does the wifi control module have to be kept on dry land? Can it be floated?</strong></p>
<p>The wifi module couldn't float on the water, cause it's ip57 rating waterproof. It can withstand water, but not like being immersed of float on water for too long. So we don't suggest that put it in the water.</p>
<p><strong>5. How does the cruise map on app work?</strong></p>
<p>GeneRov app can automatically record the diving path as reflects on the cruise map. Users can refer to the map and make your diving trip more safe and fun.</p>
<p><strong>6. How to put on filters?</strong></p>
<p>You could just tighten it on the metal plates around the camera.</p>
<p><strong>7. Does the lens have a protection collar to prevent scratching if you bump coral or a prop?</strong></p>
<p>The lens is made of aluminum alloy and hard glass which are not that easy being scratched in normal use since we have done hundreds of tests. <br/>And also the lens rest at the deepest point surrounded by metal plates, so in case of collision, it's gonna scratch the metal instead of the lens.</p>
<p><strong>8. What're the pins of the connection on TITAN?</strong></p>
<p>The top connection got 4 pins, two points power source, and the other 2 are PLC+and n/a. <br/>The bottom connection got 8 pins for the other payload, eg. the sonar or the robotic arm.</p>
<p><strong>9. What's the record time on the onboard internal storage?</strong></p>
<p>The record time on the internal 32 G storage would be like 4 hrs for 4K and 8 hrs for 1080P.</p>
<p><strong>10. Is it possible to move Titan sideways at a fixed depth and heading?</strong></p>
<p>It's possible to make the drone lean but not sway at a fixed depth and heading.</p></figure></div></div>","US warehous in stock, ship out in 3 dayshttps://geneinno.us/products/geneinno-t1

Securely Store Small Valuables Under Cape  Secure Sunglasses with Adjustable Bungee Windy Days?  Bring Em' ON!Highly Wind Resistant! 
The Shape Flexer Brim will not fold or flop in wind up to 65mph/105 kph.
If it's any windier than that, seek shelter immediately!   

A back brim that WON'T cramp your style!Fine Tune the Brim 
If you hate your sunhat smacking into your backpack, bend the back up for clearance!
Or, bend the back up to avoid hitting your back in sports!
 Other Sunhat wires don't compare!
Shape Flexer's Superior Brim Wire 
Most sunhats don't come with a wire in the brim.
Those that do, come with either a thin, flimsy, non shape-able plastic wire, or a thin metal wire not meant to be bent or shaped.
The Shape Flexer has a patent pending, thick, shape-able, waterproof, durable wire built into the brim.
  Back cape at your disposal!Deploy-able Hidden Neck Cape 
Sunhats that only have a neck cape to protect the back of the neck can be a hinderance. On hot days, the lack of ventilation causes the neck to roast.
However, if you find yourself needing one at any time,  pull it out and hook it in!
 Liberate the Locks!
If you ever want extra head ventilation take advantage of the zip off crown!
Perfect if you want to avoid ""Squashed Sweaty Hat Hair"". 
Give your long hair someplace to go! Or, just let your hair fly free! Even if you don't have big hair, (if it isn't windy) you can unzip the crown 3/4 the way for extra ventilation! Zip Off Crown Singin' in the Rain!Waterproof! 
Water will not harm the Shape Flexer wire, nor the fabric.
Keep the rain off your face.  Even in a torrential downpour, the brim won't buckle! 
   Clean it in a Flash!Washer/Dryer Safe! 
Take the time out of cleaning salt stains, dirt, mud, or grime by popping it in the washer and dryer! 
Wash on ""Warm"" or ""Cold"" cycles.
Tumble dry on LOW heat, or drip dry (the Shape Flexer is only damp after a wash cycle, and it air dries quickly!) 
  Stay Portable!Fit it into a pocket! 
Easily fold the Shape Flexer in half twice to fit it into the smallest of spaces. 
With security ever tightening at sporting events and concerts, the bags allowed are getting smaller and smaller.  No problem for the Shape Flexer!
Largest bag allowed to an NFL game as of 2017 Stop the ""Strangle and Dangle!""How many times have people had to carry around their sunhat like this? 
When people are out for the day with a sunhat, but out of the sun (or it has gone down), it's all too common to see their hats dangling behind them.  
The thin strap is then constantly tugging at your neck while the sunhat is flapping around behind you.  While this won't kill you, it can be very annoying.
This isn't a fashion statement, but rather done because the sunhat is too bulky/fragile to get into your bag, your pocket, your lap, or on a table!
 Lighten Up!  Where is he? Flip the brim up to clearly see your face in a photo while leaving the hat on!   ""Stay IN the Sunhat Mr. Sweatband!""Say goodbye to sweatbands flopping out! The Shape Flexer's sweatband is sewn in at four points to keep it IN the hat where it belongs.  Three Sizes Fit ALL Adults   Fine Tune the Size with the Adjustable Cord! 
The Shape Flexer will come in three sizes that will fit ALL adult heads.
Choose between the Small/Medium (S/M), the Large/X-Large (L/XL), and a XXL/XXXL. 
Adjust the cord to fine tune the size.
Loosen the cord up a bit to fit the hat over a winter cap or jacket hood in cold and/or windy conditions.

PLEASE don't be scared off by the shipping cost for one hat. 
I realize it's high, but look at the shipping cost for 2, 3, or 4 hats.
You will find the shipping price per hat for multiple hats is MUCH LOWER than the price for one.
I recommend making a pledge with friends or family, or getting extra Shape Flexers as gifts to bring the shipping price down.

<p>It is tiring and frustrating to fail again and again when learning sea wave surfing--that has stopped many people from enjoying one of the world's greatest sports.

</div></div>","If you've ever been surfing one time, you know the routine:
Paddle against the waves for 45 minutes, get knocked back by a few waves, choke on seawater, then look back and notice you've only made it about 20 yards from the ocean.Then, spend $700 on a real surfboard, and $100 per lesson on several lessons, and maybe you'll be able to have one decent surf session.And if you don't live next to the water? You were out of luck, until now.
We wanted to bring the world's best water sport to the water near you, and along the way, we made the most affordable e-surfboard without compromising performance.
This is the Blea Shark (pronounced ""Blee"", not ""Blay""), and to be clear this is a surfboard, not arocket (although you might have a hard time telling the difference once you ride one).
Forget about waiting for the perfect weather conditions or the perfect wave. Surf in Kansas in the winter, at your local pond, or in your neighbor's pool. Surf in Austria, surf in Lesotho, or even surf in Mongolia for all we care.
Beat the other surfers out to the big waves, or take this on a still lake. With Blea, there are no more limits--just pure fun.
It is tiring and frustrating to fail again and again when learning sea wave surfing--that has stopped many people from enjoying one of the world's greatest sports. With Blea, anyone can master the ocean in 5 minutes. It cuts the pain and leaves all the good.
No matter who we show this to--from people who can't swim, to people who spend every day chasing waves--everyone simply loves it.In addition to the 30 mph top speed and the generous 1.5 hour battery, here are a few other features that set us apart from every electric surfboard on the market:
Swappable battery. With simple swapping the battery, you define how long you would like to play.
Light Weight. Easy to carry around.Almost no maintenance required. Save time and hassle in maintaining the board.
