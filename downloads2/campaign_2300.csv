<p>Hello folks,</p>
<p>I'm currently working on a project revolving around 300 - 72 Princess, together with FRAME Arts Warehouse.  We have currently turned self-sufficient and profitable, and are looking to raise funds to further our goal of artist development in the city of Winnipeg.  All funds can be used to invest in all kinds of art projects.  Albums, shows, touring, music videos, training, development etc.  Currently, all our previous funds were put into assets to get up and running, and now we are, so any funds we raise can be invested into all kinds of musical and video projects.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Basically each project should start at $5000, so there's no lack of overhead funds.  Each project involves a unique experience, either an album release show, a festival, a training gathering, whatever we get, we can create as many projects as our folks can come up with.  We've put on festivals and shows for a long time without even making money, so we have an extensive reach into the Winnipeg music scene.  </div>
<div>If we don't reach our goal, we can either return the funds, or put them in part to a smaller project we would announce ahead of time</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The impact is to the benefit of the music scene as a whole.  This city has a reputation for producing talented artists of all kinds, rock, folk, pop, EDM, actors. etc.  It's been a struggle just to get recognized for your talent though, unless you know the right people.  Our goal is to break that cycle, and help people who take care of themselves achieve their goals.  </div>
<div>We've currently worked and plan to in the next few months work with an extensive amount of Manitoban artists, such as</div>

We like so many other parents didn't know our baby was affected until he was born. The cause is unknown. Both Joshua's hands were affected he is missing fingers and most of them are small  Joshua is now 15 and he still amazes me everyday with all his accomplishments. Every time we thought he would not be able to do something due to his hand deformities he proved us wrong, he struggled many times but always found a way to do what he needed to do. Like every parent with a child affected with ABS you learn that these kids are amazing and never let anything stop them. Joshua has had a hard time growing up being different, looking different even though we never let him feel different at home and with family to us he was our little boy and still is but kids can be cruel. He would come home many times from school in tears asking why his hands were different and why the kids wouldn't just leave him alone and stop picking on him. They would push him around and call him names and physically and emotionally hurt him. He is very self concious of his hands and feet and it is heart breaking watching him silently suffering. This is what has brought me here, I need help getting a 3d printer for Joshua. My partner has with Joshua designed a robotic hand that will help him do the things he can't, and has troubles with. My partner came up with the idea after seeing these hands on the internet and Joshuas face lit up at the idea of having something made like this. Unfortunatly they are very expensive to make into the thousands of dollars. They both built a prototype using some mouldable plastic but now they need to finish and the only way to make all the movable parts is by 3d printing. Joshua loves computers and we are doing our best to push him into that direction for his future career, having a printer that he can make new hands for himself is the first step. Any help would greatly be appreciated to make Joshua's life easier. THANKYOU for taking the time to read and thankyou for any donations you might make.</p><p> Sincerely Helen obrien.</p></div>","Hi everyone my name is Helen and my son Joshua was born with ABS ( amniotic band syndrome) it is a condition where bands form in the womb and get caught around the baby and it leads to restrictions in growth causing deformed fingers, toes and sometimes amputation of fingers, toes, arms, legs.

</div><p>This Is my life, I spend every waking minute available on building my career as a painter. When I come home from my day job at 330pm-4pm depending on traffic I eat something take a quick nap (20-30 minutes as suggested by NASA) and get to work from 5pm-12am. Sleep and wake up at 530am to get to work by 7. rinse and repeat. I have slept on a couch for the past 6 years so I can use my room as my studio. Everything I do is timed and recorded in my work journal. I have a sense of humor but do not joke around with my career. I am saving every nickel and penny I can for my trip to Europe. I want to attend schooling at Studio Escalier and Angel Academy of Art, in the meantime I keep by my own curriculum of life drawing, master studies and anatomy memorization. There Is also a local artist by the name of Matt Dickson who holds classes on a weekly basis, Id like to continue to attend his classes for the next year and learn as much as I can before I leave.

This exhibition will introduce young illustration artists to the public and encourage these artists and others to promote their artworks in the community. The artists represented in the exhibition are from different countries and they create artworks with Eastern and Western cultural backgrounds. Based on this, I want to provide the audience with an unbiased environment to understand both of them, and have the opportunity to communicate with these young artists.</span></p>

<h3>What is Global Arts Miniature?</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">
Global
Arts Miniature is an illustration exhibition designed to build a connection
with artists and audience. Thefive artists are from different countries and
regions with different cultural backgrounds. Consequently, their artworks have
different styles and expressions, especially in Eastern and Western culture. The
exhibition is an opportunity for these artists to come together in artistic
expression, but also express their unique experiences through their own styles.
It is important for the community to share in the experiences of each artist in
the exhibition to educate themselves not only of the contemporary art movement,
but also see firsthand how culture is still affecting the art world. </span><br/></p>

<p><i>Native Immigrant</i> has transformed from its original inception by artist, Carolina Echeverria, to an emerging collective of ten to fifteen people, six of whom will be travelling to Mapuche territory in Victoria and Santiago de Chile to participate in the Encuentro ‘Native Immigrant Chile 2015’ to be held in the Espacio de Arte Departamento 44 and in the streets of the cities of Santiago and Victoria, Chile.</p>
<p>The event, which will take place from June 22nd to July 5th 2015, will include Native Immigrant dressmaking and story-collecting, as well as performances, forums, lectures, visual art exhibitions and site-specific installations. Participating artists will create works inspired by the stories collected throughout the entire process. The purpose of this phase of Native Immigrant is to create dialogue and to build bridges between First Nations and immigrants, both in Canada and in Chile.</p>
<h2><b>The Vision</b></h2>
<p>Among the Iroquois, Wampum Beads were beaded for various purposes such as recording on strings, the condolence ceremony. Wampum belts were also created to record treaty events. Most relevant to our beadwork project is the Circle Wampum, which is the constitution of the Iroquois Confederacy. The fifty strings represent the fifty ""chiefs"" of the Confederacy. Sha'tethonatte': they are all the same height. This is what the fifty strings represent. The ""chiefs"" must work together collaborative with each other, and with the clan mothers. The clan mothers work together with the people. Sha'tetionkwatte': We are all the same height. No one is above the other. This is the basis for the Iroquois vision of world peace. It is all recorded in beads, wampum beads. Our symbol, at the top of the tree of Great Peace, is the Eagle that sees afar - the eagle that we say protects the children. We wish to share this point of view with all the people of the world, particularly the Mapuche, the people of the Condor. We wish to learn their understanding of the world, and how they recorded it. Was it with beads, or with some other art form? What is the Mapuche vision of world peace? How was it recorded, and remembered. We wish to exchange art forms about peace, with the Mapuche, and if all agree, share this knowledge with the world, beginning in August, in old Montreal.”</p>
<p>-Philip Deering</p>
<h2><b>Why raise funds?</b></h2>
<p>Native Immigrant needs funds for two main reasons: to support participating artists’ travel to and around Chile, and to bring a Mapuche artist to Canada to present work at the Ashukan Cultural Center in August, 2015. This is an important cultural exchange that resonates with all communities involved, as well as with mandates to promote First Nations cultures within Canada and Chile. A small portion of the funds raised will also be used for promotional material, materials for the site-specific work, to secure a place at Espacio de Arte Departamento 44, and as honoraria for artists taking part in the Kultrun of Peace events in Victoria and Santiago de Chile. Traveling artists will be billeted in the host communities; so no outside funds will be required for food or lodging.</p>

Her writing has been featured in NACLA, Siafu Magazine, and the Upstream Journal and her art practice has been featured in The New Quarterly, Hyperallergic, Génération d’idées, and on Les Nouveaux Explorateurs (Canal +). She has also had feature interviews on Global TV and CBC radio. In recent years, Judith has attempted to bridge the gap between art-making and activism through a variety of means – from furtive practices, to socially-engaged visual works, to collaborations that engage with others, whether artists or the general public, to generate new ideas around creating peace.</p>
<p><b>Tais Costa</b> was born in Brazil and moved to Montreal at the age of twelve, where she became an artist. Helping NI with website design, video and documentation, she is able to contribute both with her artistic vision and immigration experience. She is currently exploring South America and is already planting some seeds for Native Immigrant in Chile.</p>
<p><b>Saulo Cruz de Oliveira</b> was born in 1973 in São Paulo (Brazil). He started his musical studies at age 13 with Raymond Roger Rainville in the “Senac Marching Band” (trombone, euphonium and theory) and with Manoel Hermínio Marques de Souza at the Carlos Gomes Conservatoire (piano). He pursued his studies at the “Drama and Music Conservatoire Dr. Carlos de Campos” in Tatuí - São Paulo (trombone, piano, harpsichord and composition), where he also worked for five years as a teacher in the piano chair.</p>
<p>As our main NI partner in Chile, Saulo will be traveling with us to the South and will be introducing his original musical creations to our encounters.</p>
<p><b>Carolina Echeverria</b> is an artist, storyteller and the creator of a powerful relationship with words; Carolina Echeverría was born in Santiago de Chile. She left in 1986, re-rooting herself in Montreal, Quebec.</p>
<p>Carolina is no stranger to controversy: her exhibits have always challenged social norms. Carolina believes in the power of a woman to change the current of perception in today’s world. A stranger in a strange land, she has adapted to a new culture while protecting her true self from its divisive politics.</p>
<p>Carolina has been working on an artistic statement of collective cultural values since 2010. As an artist, she seeks to bridge immigrants and First Nations, to talk about the space between Native and Immigrant by inserting a hyphen—a symbol of what holds us all together, to preserve the space in which dialogue, creativity, and true healing can occur.</p>
<p><b>Philip Deering</b> - Mohawk Cultural Interpreter, educator.</p>

<p>As a member of Native Immigrant Collective, Agata continues her engagement in activities of immigrant dress-making as artistic expression of cultural exchange, building tolerance and inclusiveness.</p>
<p><b>Roxana Miranda Rupailaf </b>- Mapuche Poet</p>
<p>Roxana (1982, Osorno) is one of the most interesting and compelling Mapuche poets in contemporary Chile and part of the dazzling picture of young poets in Chile. “Without a doubt, a captivating poetry that explores - saying of Pablo Huirimilla - a certain feminine ontology associated with sexuality, the body, in a controversial dialogue with images that inherited the great judeo-Christian allegories. In addition to a gender awareness, which in turn is also informed by an awareness of ethnicity, given their status as poet mapuche huilliche. Finally, a poet who must be taken into account.</p>

<p>Les ceintures de wampum ont également été créées lors d’événements et de traités.</p>
<p>Le plus pertinent à notre projet de perlage est le Wampum du cercle, qui représente la constitution de la Confédération iroquoise.</p>
<p>Les cinquante liens (cordes) représentent cinquante « chefs » de la Confédération.</p>
<p>Sha'tethonatte': Ils ont tous la même hauteur.</p>
<p>C'est ce que représentent les cinquante cordes.</p>
<p>Les « chefs » doivent travailler ensemble et collaborer entre eux et avec les Mères du clan. Les Mères du clan travaillent avec le peuple.</p>
<p>Sha'tetionkwatte': Nous sommes tous de la même hauteur. </p>
<p>Nul n'est au-dessus de l'autre.</p>
<p>C'est la base de la vision iroquoise de la paix dans le monde. Elle est  enregistrée avec des perles, des perles de wampum.</p>
<p>Notre symbole, tout en haut de l'arbre de la Grande Paix, est l'aigle qui voit loin - l'aigle qui, comme nous le disons, protège les enfants.</p>
<p>Nous tenons à partager ce point de vue avec tous les peuples du monde, et en particulier avec les Mapuches, le peuple du Condor. Nous voulons apprendre leur compréhension du monde, et comment ils l’ont enregistré.  Était-ce avec des perles, ou avec une autre forme d'art. Quelle est la vision de la paix mondiale des Mapuche? Comment était elle enregistrée et remémorée?</p>
<p>Nous souhaitons échanger nos formes d'art sur la paix, avec les Mapuches et si tous sont d'accord, partager ces connaissances avec le monde, en commençant en août, dans le Vieux-Montréal.”</p>

<h2><b>Pourquoi une collecte de fonds?</b></h2>
<p><i>Immigrant de souche</i> a besoin de fonds pour deux raisons principales: Pour financer le voyage des artistes participants au Chili et inviter un artiste Mapuche au Canada pour présenter ses oeuvres  au Centre Culturel Ashukan au mois d’août 2015. Il s’agit d’un échange culturel important qui résonne avec toutes les communautés concernées, ainsi que pour poursuivre le mandat de promouvoir les cultures des Premières Nations au Canada et au Chili. Une petite partie des fonds recueillis servira à la production du matériel promotionnel, à l’achat de matériaux pour les œuvres in situ, et pour obtenir un espace au Departamento de Espacio de Arte 44 ainsi que pour les honoraires des artistes chiliens qui participent aux événements Kultrun de la paix à Victoria et à Santiago du Chili. Les artistes seront logés dans les communautés d’accueil, donc aucun financement ne sera nécessaire pour les repas ou l’hébergement.</p>

Native Immigrant has transformed from its original inception by artist, Carolina Echeverria, to an emerging collective of ten to fifteen people, six of whom will be travelling to Mapuche territory in Victoria and Santiago de Chile to participate in the Encuentro ‘Native Immigrant Chile 2015’ to be held in the Espacio de Arte Departamento 44 and in the streets of the cities of Santiago and Victoria, Chile.
The event, which will take place from June 22nd to July 5th 2015, will include Native Immigrant dressmaking and story-collecting, as well as performances, forums, lectures, visual art exhibitions and site-specific installations. Participating artists will create works inspired by the stories collected throughout the entire process. The purpose of this phase of Native Immigrant is to create dialogue and to build bridges between First Nations and immigrants, both in Canada and in Chile.
The Vision
Among the Iroquois, Wampum Beads were beaded for various purposes such as recording on strings, the condolence ceremony. Wampum belts were also created to record treaty events. Most relevant to our beadwork project is the Circle Wampum, which is the constitution of the Iroquois Confederacy. The fifty strings represent the fifty ""chiefs"" of the Confederacy. Sha'tethonatte': they are all the same height. This is what the fifty strings represent. The ""chiefs"" must work together collaborative with each other, and with the clan mothers. The clan mothers work together with the people. Sha'tetionkwatte': We are all the same height. No one is above the other. This is the basis for the Iroquois vision of world peace. It is all recorded in beads, wampum beads. Our symbol, at the top of the tree of Great Peace, is the Eagle that sees afar - the eagle that we say protects the children. We wish to share this point of view with all the people of the world, particularly the Mapuche, the people of the Condor. We wish to learn their understanding of the world, and how they recorded it. Was it with beads, or with some other art form? What is the Mapuche vision of world peace? How was it recorded, and remembered. We wish to exchange art forms about peace, with the Mapuche, and if all agree, share this knowledge with the world, beginning in August, in old Montreal.”
-Philip Deering
Why raise funds?
Native Immigrant needs funds for two main reasons: to support participating artists’ travel to and around Chile, and to bring a Mapuche artist to Canada to present work at the Ashukan Cultural Center in August, 2015. This is an important cultural exchange that resonates with all communities involved, as well as with mandates to promote First Nations cultures within Canada and Chile. A small portion of the funds raised will also be used for promotional material, materials for the site-specific work, to secure a place at Espacio de Arte Departamento 44, and as honoraria for artists taking part in the Kultrun of Peace events in Victoria and Santiago de Chile. Traveling artists will be billeted in the host communities; so no outside funds will be required for food or lodging.

Her writing has been featured in NACLA, Siafu Magazine, and the Upstream Journal and her art practice has been featured in The New Quarterly, Hyperallergic, Génération d’idées, and on Les Nouveaux Explorateurs (Canal +). She has also had feature interviews on Global TV and CBC radio. In recent years, Judith has attempted to bridge the gap between art-making and activism through a variety of means – from furtive practices, to socially-engaged visual works, to collaborations that engage with others, whether artists or the general public, to generate new ideas around creating peace.
Tais Costa was born in Brazil and moved to Montreal at the age of twelve, where she became an artist. Helping NI with website design, video and documentation, she is able to contribute both with her artistic vision and immigration experience. She is currently exploring South America and is already planting some seeds for Native Immigrant in Chile.
Saulo Cruz de Oliveira was born in 1973 in São Paulo (Brazil). He started his musical studies at age 13 with Raymond Roger Rainville in the “Senac Marching Band” (trombone, euphonium and theory) and with Manoel Hermínio Marques de Souza at the Carlos Gomes Conservatoire (piano). He pursued his studies at the “Drama and Music Conservatoire Dr. Carlos de Campos” in Tatuí - São Paulo (trombone, piano, harpsichord and composition), where he also worked for five years as a teacher in the piano chair.
As our main NI partner in Chile, Saulo will be traveling with us to the South and will be introducing his original musical creations to our encounters.
Carolina Echeverria is an artist, storyteller and the creator of a powerful relationship with words; Carolina Echeverría was born in Santiago de Chile. She left in 1986, re-rooting herself in Montreal, Quebec.
Carolina is no stranger to controversy: her exhibits have always challenged social norms. Carolina believes in the power of a woman to change the current of perception in today’s world. A stranger in a strange land, she has adapted to a new culture while protecting her true self from its divisive politics.
Carolina has been working on an artistic statement of collective cultural values since 2010. As an artist, she seeks to bridge immigrants and First Nations, to talk about the space between Native and Immigrant by inserting a hyphen—a symbol of what holds us all together, to preserve the space in which dialogue, creativity, and true healing can occur.

As a member of Native Immigrant Collective, Agata continues her engagement in activities of immigrant dress-making as artistic expression of cultural exchange, building tolerance and inclusiveness.
Roxana Miranda Rupailaf - Mapuche Poet
Roxana (1982, Osorno) is one of the most interesting and compelling Mapuche poets in contemporary Chile and part of the dazzling picture of young poets in Chile. “Without a doubt, a captivating poetry that explores - saying of Pablo Huirimilla - a certain feminine ontology associated with sexuality, the body, in a controversial dialogue with images that inherited the great judeo-Christian allegories. In addition to a gender awareness, which in turn is also informed by an awareness of ethnicity, given their status as poet mapuche huilliche. Finally, a poet who must be taken into account.

Tissage et Visions de paix:  Chili – juin 2015
Immigrant de souche, conçu par l'artiste Carolina Echeverria,a évolué depuis sa création, en un collectif émergent de dix à quinze personnes, dont six se rendront en territoire Mapuche, à Victoria et à Santiago au Chili, pour participer à l’Encuentro Native Immigrant au Chili 2015, qui se tiendra dans le Departamento del Espacio de Arte 44 et dans les rues des villes de Santiago et Victoria, au Chili.
L'événement, qui aura lieu du 22 juin au 5 juillet 2015, comprendra l’oeuvre collective qu’est la confection de la robe de l’Immigrant et le recueil des histoires personnelles des participants, ainsi que des spectacles, forums, conférences, expositions d'arts visuels et installations in situ. Les artistes/participants créeront des travaux inspirés par les récits recueillis tout au long du processus. Cette phase de l’Immigrant de souche vise à établir un dialogue et à créer des ponts entre les Premières Nations et les immigrants, au Canada et au Chili. 
La Vision

<h3>Short Summary</h3>Hi! We are Artist Organized Art, a non-profit, 501(c)(3) committed to supporting artist organized media, events and cultural education. We have over 150,000 all time email subscribers and over 5,000 members of our currently decomissioned wiki. Our online community of artists and arts professionals is global, with 44% in North America, 33% in Europe, 23% in Asia and beyond.<br/><br/>We are excited about art, data and collaboration. In 2008 we launched a very crude wiki which allowed our community to sign up and collaborate on pages, upload works, promote projects and cross link to social networks while informing an authoritative following of artist organizers. Our wiki attracted over 5000 editors and was a great resource for raw expressions from all over the world. A wiki is special, because it looks technical and allows for collaboration. Art looks especially anarchic in the wiki container, which also features taxonomy and geo tagging. We want to run the wiki as one big book of art made together!<br/><br/><p>Because of a growing user base, we've had to upgrade our server. Our current wiki can't migrate. We need to raise a production budget to customize and launch a new wiki script, then open it up to all of you for accounts. We also need to carefully migrate data from the old wiki to the new wiki. It's many days of work, that's why we need to raise a small budget to push this project through.</p>
<p>Please help us with your donation and support our wiki community today. It's a resource you can positively impact that gives you the power to make an impact.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are raising $3,500.00 to compensate our design and IT workers and to pay for the cost of outreach, for hosting, engineering and bandwith.<br/></p>
<p>Your donations come with some very useful perks. Take full advantage of our newsletter and announcements service in exchange for your support. Our social networks and corporate Youtube channel are also at your disposal for donating. You can literally go global over night. <a href=""http://get-started.artistorganizedart.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://get-started.artistorganizedart.org</a><br/></p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal we will apply what we have rasied to the project and run a new campaign to continue financing work until we launch. We are fundraising as a group so you can choose to donate by credit card or by PayPal. All donations to Artist Organized Art are tax deductible under 501(c)(3). Yay!</p>

<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>As editors, artists and arts professionals will find a lot to like in the art-wiki. Editors can create substantial entries that rival the scope of wikipedia, but without the fear of deletion. That means almost anything can be included and collaborated. There are social tools, media tools and geographic tools, to name a few.  Everyone will benefit from the collective expression and will be welcomed to add to it. An open art-wiki is a very cool thing to support in today's world.<br/></p>
<p>We have a proven track record. Since 2008 Artist Organized Art has successfully launched a newswire grown to over 150,000 targeted email recipients. We've also been the strategic partner to a nationally syndicated TV show of experimental art with 16 episodes, 28 minutes each (<a href=""http://switch.artistorganizedart.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://switch.artistorganizedart.org</a> ). Having launched a feature articles archive with hundreds of entries, our correspondents have covered major art fairs, gone to the White House, The Venice Biennale, The Cannes Film Festival and many other venues. We also acquired New Observations Magazine with 128 back issues and launched the publication back into print (<a href=""http://newobs.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://newobs.org</a> ). This all happened while we successfully launched an art-wiki and ran it for over 5,000 editors from cities all over the world. We can handle this re-launch technically, if we can raise the funds.<br/></p>
<p>We have given over $30,000.00 in artist grants since 2012 and have raised over $15,000.00 in crowd funding contributions for partner projects. Your support will go directly into the culture that surrounds you.</p>

</div></div>","Short SummaryHi! We are Artist Organized Art, a non-profit, 501(c)(3) committed to supporting artist organized media, events and cultural education. We have over 150,000 all time email subscribers and over 5,000 members of our currently decomissioned wiki. Our online community of artists and arts professionals is global, with 44% in North America, 33% in Europe, 23% in Asia and beyond.We are excited about art, data and collaboration. In 2008 we launched a very crude wiki which allowed our community to sign up and collaborate on pages, upload works, promote projects and cross link to social networks while informing an authoritative following of artist organizers. Our wiki attracted over 5000 editors and was a great resource for raw expressions from all over the world. A wiki is special, because it looks technical and allows for collaboration. Art looks especially anarchic in the wiki container, which also features taxonomy and geo tagging. We want to run the wiki as one big book of art made together!Because of a growing user base, we've had to upgrade our server. Our current wiki can't migrate. We need to raise a production budget to customize and launch a new wiki script, then open it up to all of you for accounts. We also need to carefully migrate data from the old wiki to the new wiki. It's many days of work, that's why we need to raise a small budget to push this project through.
Please help us with your donation and support our wiki community today. It's a resource you can positively impact that gives you the power to make an impact.

SWITCH TV, New Observations Magazine and Artist Organized Art Online are all programs of Artist Organized Art


  What We Need & What You Get
We are raising $3,500.00 to compensate our design and IT workers and to pay for the cost of outreach, for hosting, engineering and bandwith.
Your donations come with some very useful perks. Take full advantage of our newsletter and announcements service in exchange for your support. Our social networks and corporate Youtube channel are also at your disposal for donating. You can literally go global over night. http://get-started.artistorganizedart.org
If we don't reach our entire goal we will apply what we have rasied to the project and run a new campaign to continue financing work until we launch. We are fundraising as a group so you can choose to donate by credit card or by PayPal. All donations to Artist Organized Art are tax deductible under 501(c)(3). Yay!



  The Impact As editors, artists and arts professionals will find a lot to like in the art-wiki. Editors can create substantial entries that rival the scope of wikipedia, but without the fear of deletion. That means almost anything can be included and collaborated. There are social tools, media tools and geographic tools, to name a few.  Everyone will benefit from the collective expression and will be welcomed to add to it. An open art-wiki is a very cool thing to support in today's world.
We have a proven track record. Since 2008 Artist Organized Art has successfully launched a newswire grown to over 150,000 targeted email recipients. We've also been the strategic partner to a nationally syndicated TV show of experimental art with 16 episodes, 28 minutes each (http://switch.artistorganizedart.org ). Having launched a feature articles archive with hundreds of entries, our correspondents have covered major art fairs, gone to the White House, The Venice Biennale, The Cannes Film Festival and many other venues. We also acquired New Observations Magazine with 128 back issues and launched the publication back into print (http://newobs.org ). This all happened while we successfully launched an art-wiki and ran it for over 5,000 editors from cities all over the world. We can handle this re-launch technically, if we can raise the funds.
We have given over $30,000.00 in artist grants since 2012 and have raised over $15,000.00 in crowd funding contributions for partner projects. Your support will go directly into the culture that surrounds you.

<p>My name is Marian Petrovici and I am an orthodox priest and
painter of Byzantine religious icons.</p>
<p>The project that I propose is one for the soul:</p><p> <b>„The
Religious Icon – Warmth and Light of the Heart”</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>
</p><p>             Byzantine church icons are wooden objects painted with
religious scenes, saints, the Holy Virgin or Jesus Christ, the Saviour. Their
purpose in to bring us closer to God. As we have strong feelings when looking
at the picture of somebody dear to us, in the same way icons touch the soul of
those who pray or meditate. By respecting the icons, we respect those who are
represented there in a symbolic way. The wood of the icon is only a support. </p>
<span></span>
<p>
</p><p>The icon painting is a century-long tradition of the Church,
dating back to the times of the Holy Apostles. Saint Luke the Evangelist
himself  was the first who painted the
Holy Virgin. It is from him that we inherited this gift through the Church and
we are bound to hand it down to the generations to come.</p>

</p><p>In the spirit of the above-mentioned ideas, I initiated a
project by which I intend to make a professional tutorial presenting in detail
all the phases of Byzantine icon painting. Namely: preparing the wood, ground
coating, drawing, gold application, painting of the saint and varnishing the
icon.</p>

<br/></div>","My name is Marian Petrovici and I am an orthodox priest and
painter of Byzantine religious icons.
The project that I propose is one for the soul: „The
Religious Icon – Warmth and Light of the Heart”


             Byzantine church icons are wooden objects painted with
religious scenes, saints, the Holy Virgin or Jesus Christ, the Saviour. Their
purpose in to bring us closer to God. As we have strong feelings when looking
at the picture of somebody dear to us, in the same way icons touch the soul of
those who pray or meditate. By respecting the icons, we respect those who are
represented there in a symbolic way. The wood of the icon is only a support. 


The icon painting is a century-long tradition of the Church,
dating back to the times of the Holy Apostles. Saint Luke the Evangelist
himself  was the first who painted the
Holy Virgin. It is from him that we inherited this gift through the Church and
we are bound to hand it down to the generations to come.
    
In the spirit of the above-mentioned ideas, I initiated a
project by which I intend to make a professional tutorial presenting in detail
all the phases of Byzantine icon painting. Namely: preparing the wood, ground
coating, drawing, gold application, painting of the saint and varnishing the
icon.
      How will the funds be used?

How will the funds be used?

<p>Hello all, my name is Marzia Ellero Ransom. I am an Italian artist living and working in the beautiful Pensacola, Florida. I have created art for as long as I can remember, and I was able to follow my dreams by pursuing an artistic career. Even though I am primarily a painter, my fascination with different mediums has led me to investigate disparate subject matters.<br/></p>
<p>I grew up in the North-East of Italy where I was accustomed to visit museums and beautiful churches filled with timeless and breathtaking works of art.  My dream was to become an artist and create art that would spark profound emotions in the heart of the viewer. I have been interested in historical subject matters for several years now, and in 2008 I began working on a large project called <i>Deificatio</i>. This has been quite an extraordinary journey. For reference, throughout the project, I studied the Bible, the Apocrypha, and other ancient texts. The result was a stunning collection of black and white photographs of specific biblical characters who were martyred, persecuted, or otherwise raptured, depicted by various models suspended and bound with ropes.</p>
<p><i>Deificatio</i> took two years to complete, and was a success. I knew then, however, that I wanted to continue this journey and create additional works to complement the cycle of memorable photographs. I set out to create a video; a layered compilation of moving images representing the <i>Lamentation and Piet</i><i>á</i>. However well received, the video is representative of a mere sketch of what my mind has conceived during these years of investigation. This new project, <i>Via Crucis (the Moving Altarpiece)</i>, is a piece depicting the Crucifixion, Deposition, and Lamentation of Christ, referencing some of my favorite works of art from the late Medieval period. The <i>Via Crucis (the Moving Altariece)</i> will define a necessary transition in my artistic achievement as well as my passion for research. Because of the extent of my vision, a professional cinematic crew needs to be involved in the process, and only with your generous contribution the<i> Via Crucis (the Moving Altarpiece)</i> can become a reality, allowing me to continue expanding my research and my art making career. </p>
<p>I have began exhibiting consistently since 2005, and my work has been 
shown in United States as well as Italy and Costa Rica. My work has been
 collected and appreciated for sometime now, and I believe this project 
to be a crowning moment in my career. In the past, I have developed 
several artistic projects, and managed large groups of people in order 
to achieve the desired results. In all, I believe this project to be 
most valuable in regards to the actualization of a historical subject 
matter that has been developed throughout the history of the arts. The 
contemporary spin given will definitely be appealing to different 
generations of artists and viewers. <br/></p>
<p>Video making is a very expensive art form. Understanding its machinery, its complexity, and every quiver of its beating heart is key to the creation of a meaningful work of art that is also professionally presented. In the eventuality my project does not meet the required amount, I will be working towards a smaller version of the video, using less materials and re-dimensioning the crew needed to create the work of art.</p>
<p>Based on the given budget, the sum needed to fund the video production, 
and make this dream a reality is that of $22,922.  The artists involved 
in the realization of my dream, fellow researchers, and the actors who 
will have to endure hours of bonding and lifting, will all need to be 
paid for their troubles, not to mention production cost, as well as the 
cost of labor; I have detailed the currant budget with all these factors

Understanding its machinery, its complexity, and every quiver of its beating heart is key to the creation of a meaningful work of art that is also professionally presented. In the eventuality my project does not meet the required amount, I will be working towards a smaller version of the video, using less materials and re-dimensioning the crew needed to create the work of art.
Based on the given budget, the sum needed to fund the video production, 
and make this dream a reality is that of $22,922.  The artists involved 
in the realization of my dream, fellow researchers, and the actors who 
will have to endure hours of bonding and lifting, will all need to be 
paid for their troubles, not to mention production cost, as well as the 
cost of labor; I have detailed the currant budget with all these factors
 in mind down below.

<p>Thank you for the support so far.  Keep spreading the word.</p>
<p>We have five videos to enjoy that are part of the YouTube Channel ""StoryCrossroads"" that can also be seen below.</p>
<p>Besides people like you, we are receiving support from other organizations.  We learned that the Utah Humanities will cover our Translation Services ($1,910) so that Spanish and ASL will also be options when we launch Story Crossroads April 15-16, 2016.</p>
<p>We are collaborating with the city of Fillmore, Utah as well as people like Clive Romney (Utah Pioneer Heritage Arts) and Ken Crossley (EngAGE Utah) to do a Grand Stories Project that has tandem telling with grandparents and grandchildren.  We will then invite some of these grand tellers to Story Crossroads.</p>
<p>In 2016, Life Story Library Foundation is focusing on immigrant and refugee stories that we want to hear on our stage for Story Crossroads.  We are voicing the forgotten of our community in a way that will be unforgettable.  </p>
<p>This gives you a hint of all the behind-the-scene works for what Story Crossroads is all about.  And why we need your help.</p>
<h3>Enjoy these other video clips.  Give today!</h3>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>This is so huge of an idea I shared with one person about 15 years ago has now grown to a whole community ready to launch Story Crossroads.  </p>
<p>We still need you.</p>
<p>We’re going to launch a six-day World Story
Crossroads to celebrate each of the six major continents in 2022.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1431277/files/20150430234247-5_Culture--Story_Crossroads--2nd_version.png?1430462567"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So why did we say ""Story Crossroads: The 2016 Launch""?  That is for Salt Lake Story Crossroads on April 15-16, 2016.  We need to grow into that World Story Crossroads adventure.  </p>
<h3>This is a free and open event and we need your help in the giving of this gift.  </h3>
<p>We have a place:  the Viridian Event Center.  It’s a Library merged with a Conference
Center.  Wrap your head around
that.  I will give you a moment.</p>
<p>Yes, what better way to celebrate stories than having a building already dedicated to stories!  This place even has broadcast abilities in and out so we are networking with other universities to pick up the signal of these stories and presentations.  It won't matter where you live.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<p></p>
<p>So you could
enjoy this in your pajamas and sporting fuzzy Big Foot slippers.</p>
<p>Of course, live is best.</p>
<p>We have the people:  80 community members--youth, adults, and seniors--will be featured along with our 50 story artists of different cultures and styles.</p>
<h3>We offer free residency programs through school districts, libraries, and other venues so that we can have those community tellers.</h3>
<p>We will have pure storytelling as well as any combination of storytelling.</p>
<p>Story and
music.</p>
<p>Story and dance.</p>
<p>Story and
theatre.</p>
<p>Story and the visual arts.</p>
<p>Story and…well…anything you can
imagine.  We <i>are</i> called Story Crossroads.</p>
<p>All those styles of storytelling is nice
but what makes it fantastic are the many languages we will hear from the stage
even from the first year we launch Story Crossroads in 2016.</p>
<p>We will have English, Spanish and American
Sign Language the first years and then add languages through the
years. </p>
<p>And we have a fiscal sponsor:  the Utah Storytelling Guild.  Donations you give to Story Crossroads are tax deductible due to this partnership.  Anything you give through this crowdsourcing campaign is linked to the Utah Storytelling Guild PayPal account.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1431845/files/20150501043307-many_usg.PNG?1430479987"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need</span></p>
</div><div> <p></p>
<p>For this crowdsourcing campaign, we will reach $15,000+.<br/></p>
<p>We know that to launch April 15-16, 2016, we need $50,000.  We are not asking $50,000 from you unless you want to write that check and we would praise your name throughout the galaxy plus shower you with the perks (see details on those below).</p>
<p>Then we could plan for a Galactic Story Crossroads instead of a World Story Crossroads.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on 2016.</p>
<p>Here is a rough breakdown of why we will eventually need $50,000 a year to run Story Crossroads:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1431725/files/20150501032532-Percentage_of_Story_Crossroads_Costs.jpeg?1430475932"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>It should be no surprise that our largest expense is to respect and pay for the talents shared by our 50 professional story artists and 80 community tellers.  Although this could be the first time the community tellers take the stage, we want to pay a small stipend as a thank you to their dedication to the art. </p>
<p><b><i>Covered Cost Covered at $5,000+ value--</i></b>Normally an event like this has “Facilities” as one of their top expenses.  We are thrilled to have the Viridian Event Center completely covered.  </p>
<p>Our ""Media Production"" costs are so high due to video and sound recording of all sessions of the main stage event.  With the Viridian Event Center's ability to broadcast, we will then stream live the Story Crossroads event to anyone who would like to pick up the signal for free.  These stories will also be archived and shared with deposition sites such as the Library of Congress.  We love the filming that has already taken place to spread the word of this campaign and for promotional use as we near the April main stage event.  Thank you, Sterling Elliott, for allowing us to do an initial payment and then take some money raised from this crowdsourcing campaign to add that rate.<br/></p>
<p>We also counted ""Value of Volunteers"" as in-kind service that is part of that $50,000 total.  Easily we could have 100 volunteers (averaging 4-hour shifts at $10.00/hour) that total from helping at outreaches, residencies, and main stage events.  </p>
<p>In September 2015, about 15 librarians will be trained to be master story facilitators through 16-hour courses conducted by experts.  These librarians then will host and teach storytelling residencies offered to the public for free.  This way, besides the storytelling happening in the classroom or after school with the school districts, we can have more youth, adults, and seniors participate with Story Crossroads.  We are not charging these librarians for this intense training yet we are covering the costs of the experts to train those librarians.  This will cost $4,800+ depending on if more librarians are interested in this service.</p>
<p><b><i>Covered Cost by Utah Humanities--</i></b>We are unique that ""Translation Services"" is a category.  Most events focus on one language and never budget this service.  Some people would argue that one could drive for miles in the United States and not have to worry about other languages.  Yet, we are rich in languages from Spanish to American Sign Language to many more.  We expect about $2,000+ for this a<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">rea.</span></p>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
We have many perks to show how much we appreciate your support. </div><div>In fact, the donation of $1.00 is exciting because you are choosing to be an active community member in this movement.  That is why you take part in our ""Globe of Fame"" page on our website.</div><div>We are especially excited when you give $10.00 and give a SHOUT OUT online plus that listing of your glorious name on the ""Globe of Fame"" page.  If you happen to have a blog, YouTube channel, website, book--something you want to promote--then your SHOUT OUT could veer in that direction that only  a name.</div><div>These next levels?  Oh, boy!<br/>

</div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/>
</h3>
</div><div> <p>Raising $50,000+ every year to run Story Crossroads could sound daunting.  It's a good thing we have consulted with other storytelling events such as the Timpanogos Storytelling Festival, the Weber State University Storytelling Festival, the Cache Valley Storytelling Festival, and the La Crosse Storytelling Festival to understand the budgets required and the possibilities of funding.  These events need more or less the same amount that we need.  Some of these events have been around for 20 or 25 years and still going strong.</p>
<p>Again, this campaign aims for $15,000+ and not that $50,000+ because we know that funding comes from more than one source.  From grants to corporate sponsors to in-kind services, we feel confident we can raise that $50,000+ each and every year.</p>
<p>No matter how the fundraising turns out to be for us, we have our facilities completely covered for those April 15-16, 2016 dates.  Facilities is usually the largest expense for this kind of venture.  We also know many community tellers who would go on stage without any kind of compensation.  Yet, we value our story artists--new to the art to veterans--and strive to show that in how we cover their fees or stipends.</p>

</div></div>","Updates!
 
Thank you for the support so far.  Keep spreading the word.
We have five videos to enjoy that are part of the YouTube Channel ""StoryCrossroads"" that can also be seen below.
Besides people like you, we are receiving support from other organizations.  We learned that the Utah Humanities will cover our Translation Services ($1,910) so that Spanish and ASL will also be options when we launch Story Crossroads April 15-16, 2016.
We are collaborating with the city of Fillmore, Utah as well as people like Clive Romney (Utah Pioneer Heritage Arts) and Ken Crossley (EngAGE Utah) to do a Grand Stories Project that has tandem telling with grandparents and grandchildren.  We will then invite some of these grand tellers to Story Crossroads.
In 2016, Life Story Library Foundation is focusing on immigrant and refugee stories that we want to hear on our stage for Story Crossroads.  We are voicing the forgotten of our community in a way that will be unforgettable.  
This gives you a hint of all the behind-the-scene works for what Story Crossroads is all about.  And why we need your help.
Enjoy these other video clips.  Give today!






Summary
This is so huge of an idea I shared with one person about 15 years ago has now grown to a whole community ready to launch Story Crossroads.  
We still need you.
We’re going to launch a six-day World Story
Crossroads to celebrate each of the six major continents in 2022.


So why did we say ""Story Crossroads: The 2016 Launch""?  That is for Salt Lake Story Crossroads on April 15-16, 2016.  We need to grow into that World Story Crossroads adventure.  
This is a free and open event and we need your help in the giving of this gift.  
We have a place:  the Viridian Event Center.  It’s a Library merged with a Conference
Center.  Wrap your head around
that.  I will give you a moment.
Yes, what better way to celebrate stories than having a building already dedicated to stories!  This place even has broadcast abilities in and out so we are networking with other universities to pick up the signal of these stories and presentations.  It won't matter where you live. 



So you could
enjoy this in your pajamas and sporting fuzzy Big Foot slippers.
Of course, live is best.
We have the people:  80 community members--youth, adults, and seniors--will be featured along with our 50 story artists of different cultures and styles.
We offer free residency programs through school districts, libraries, and other venues so that we can have those community tellers.
We will have pure storytelling as well as any combination of storytelling.
Story and
music.
Story and dance.
Story and
theatre.
Story and the visual arts.
Story and…well…anything you can
imagine.  We are called Story Crossroads.
All those styles of storytelling is nice
but what makes it fantastic are the many languages we will hear from the stage
even from the first year we launch Story Crossroads in 2016.
We will have English, Spanish and American
Sign Language the first years and then add languages through the
years. 
And we have a fiscal sponsor:  the Utah Storytelling Guild.  Donations you give to Story Crossroads are tax deductible due to this partnership.  Anything you give through this crowdsourcing campaign is linked to the Utah Storytelling Guild PayPal account.


What We Need
 
For this crowdsourcing campaign, we will reach $15,000+.
We know that to launch April 15-16, 2016, we need $50,000.  We are not asking $50,000 from you unless you want to write that check and we would praise your name throughout the galaxy plus shower you with the perks (see details on those below).
Then we could plan for a Galactic Story Crossroads instead of a World Story Crossroads.
Let’s focus on 2016.
Here is a rough breakdown of why we will eventually need $50,000 a year to run Story Crossroads:


It should be no surprise that our largest expense is to respect and pay for the talents shared by our 50 professional story artists and 80 community tellers.  Although this could be the first time the community tellers take the stage, we want to pay a small stipend as a thank you to their dedication to the art. 
Covered Cost Covered at $5,000+ value--Normally an event like this has “Facilities” as one of their top expenses.  We are thrilled to have the Viridian Event Center completely covered.  
Our ""Media Production"" costs are so high due to video and sound recording of all sessions of the main stage event.  With the Viridian Event Center's ability to broadcast, we will then stream live the Story Crossroads event to anyone who would like to pick up the signal for free.  These stories will also be archived and shared with deposition sites such as the Library of Congress.  We love the filming that has already taken place to spread the word of this campaign and for promotional use as we near the April main stage event.  Thank you, Sterling Elliott, for allowing us to do an initial payment and then take some money raised from this crowdsourcing campaign to add that rate.
We also counted ""Value of Volunteers"" as in-kind service that is part of that $50,000 total.  Easily we could have 100 volunteers (averaging 4-hour shifts at $10.00/hour) that total from helping at outreaches, residencies, and main stage events.  
In September 2015, about 15 librarians will be trained to be master story facilitators through 16-hour courses conducted by experts.  These librarians then will host and teach storytelling residencies offered to the public for free.  This way, besides the storytelling happening in the classroom or after school with the school districts, we can have more youth, adults, and seniors participate with Story Crossroads.  We are not charging these librarians for this intense training yet we are covering the costs of the experts to train those librarians.  This will cost $4,800+ depending on if more librarians are interested in this service.
Covered Cost by Utah Humanities--We are unique that ""Translation Services"" is a category.  Most events focus on one language and never budget this service.  Some people would argue that one could drive for miles in the United States and not have to worry about other languages.  Yet, we are rich in languages from Spanish to American Sign Language to many more.  We expect about $2,000+ for this area.

What You Get
We have many perks to show how much we appreciate your support. In fact, the donation of $1.00 is exciting because you are choosing to be an active community member in this movement.  That is why you take part in our ""Globe of Fame"" page on our website.We are especially excited when you give $10.00 and give a SHOUT OUT online plus that listing of your glorious name on the ""Globe of Fame"" page.  If you happen to have a blog, YouTube channel, website, book--something you want to promote--then your SHOUT OUT could veer in that direction that only  a name.These next levels?  Oh, boy!

Risks & Challenges

 Raising $50,000+ every year to run Story Crossroads could sound daunting.  It's a good thing we have consulted with other storytelling events such as the Timpanogos Storytelling Festival, the Weber State University Storytelling Festival, the Cache Valley Storytelling Festival, and the La Crosse Storytelling Festival to understand the budgets required and the possibilities of funding.  These events need more or less the same amount that we need.  Some of these events have been around for 20 or 25 years and still going strong.
Again, this campaign aims for $15,000+ and not that $50,000+ because we know that funding comes from more than one source.  From grants to corporate sponsors to in-kind services, we feel confident we can raise that $50,000+ each and every year.
No matter how the fundraising turns out to be for us, we have our facilities completely covered for those April 15-16, 2016 dates.  Facilities is usually the largest expense for this kind of venture.  We also know many community tellers who would go on stage without any kind of compensation.  Yet, we value our story artists--new to the art to veterans--and strive to show that in how we cover their fees or stipends.
Though you must know that when we had our first Community Planning Meeting in June of 2014, we had 27 people attend who represented civic, education, and arts groups.  Many people are interested and are supporting this cause.
We also received fiscal sponsorship from the Utah Storytelling Guild, a nonprofit committed to inviting all to the art of storytelling.  Besides connecting with their nonprofit status, the Utah Storytelling Guild Board voted unanimously to give us some start-up funds.
Finally, we are doing what seems crazy.  We are offering all the storytelling residencies in the libraries, schools, and other venues for free.  We are offering the entire main stage event of Story Crossroads for free.  We will not receive any ticketing revenue.  Never fear.  The Weber State University Storytelling Festival, an event about 45 minutes north of us, have been doing their 3-day event with 14,000+ crowds for free for years.
Story Crossroads is our gift to the community and to the world.  Be part of the giving.

<p>Investir em arte</p>
<p>Olá galera! Meu nome é Agus e sou faixa azul de uma arte marcial chamada Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, mas uma de minhas paixões sempre foi a fotografia.</p>
<p>Faz 2 anos, com muito esforço, comprei minha primeira câmara e minha primeira lente, foi assim que comecei a tirar fotos de meus colegas de equipe em competições de BJJ. Percebi que a gente gostava e dava valor a minhas fotos e assim decidi criar uma página no Facebook (Guardeiros BJJ) e publicar as fotos. Hoje somos uma pequena comunidade. (O vídeo que foi postado acima foi gravado e montado por mim)</p>
<p> Com sua ajuda vou poder:</p>
<p>- Eu sempre tenho dito e o mantenho, uma câmera não faz melhores fotos, mas, se você conta com os conhecimentos precisos, agiliza muito o trabalho e acho que chegou o momento de dar um passo mais e trabalhar com um material profissional, já que meus conhecimentos neste tempo têm avançado muito e poderia obter seu maior rendimento.</p>
<p>- O modelo da câmara e a lente pelas que preciso de ajuda são: <b>Canon 5D Mark III (2.690,00 €) + Canon EF 70-200mm /1:2,8 L IS USM II (2.164,45 €). </b>(este equipo é o que possuem a maioria dos fotógrafos com sucesso no BJJ)</p>
<p>- A dia de hoje, para mim é impossível investir neste material, já que não tenho um objetivo lucrativo de meu trabalho fotográfico. </p>
<p>-Jamais cobrei aos atletas pelas fotos que eu fiz, mas eu invisto varias horas ao dia tornando-se uma parte importante da minha vida. </p>
<p>- Neste esporte é muito difícil ter apoio e patrocínio para os propios atletas, imagina como fica complicado para um fotografo.</p>
<p>-As condições para tomar fotos nas competições e nas academias de BJJ são muito ruins, pouca luz, por isso com os materiais que tenho agora preciso forçar muito alguns valores que “estragam” as fotos e baixam muito a qualidade. </p>
<p>-Hoje em dia vou na maioria das competições nacionais e visito todas as academias que posso, a ajuda de vocês vai refletir em cada uma das fotografias e com isso poderão ter um maior impacto.</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Agus and I am a blue belt in a
martial art called Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. However, my other passion has always
been photography.<br/>
<br/>
Two years ago I bought my first semi-professional camera and I started to take
pictures in BJJ competitions. I noticed that people were appreciating the
pictures and I decided to create a Facebook page (Guardeiros BJJ) where I can publish
all my photos. (The link above shows a video that was shot and assembled by
me).</p>
<p>I have always believed that a better camera,
not necesarilly produces better results. However, they do facilitate the work.
Therefore I think that it is time to acquire profesional material, so I can
take advantage of my photography knowledge. </p>
<p>With your help I can:</p>
<p>Buy a CANON 5D Mark III (€ 2690.00) + Canon EF
70-200mm / 1: 2.8 L IS USM II (€ 2,164.45). (This set has been having the most
successful photographers in BJJ)</p>
<p>For me it is impossible to invest in this
equipment because I don’t get any financial benefits from the photos. I spend
several hours a day working with the photos and this has become an important
part of my life.</p>
<p>The light conditions for taking great photos in
BJJ competitions and gyms are very bad, with my current camera the potos don’t
have the quality that I want to achieve.</p>
<p>I go to many national competitions and visited
different gyms on hollidays. Every time I visit a gym, I have been treated like
family and I have always been grateful for it. Therefore, after completing the
visits, I do free advertisement for the gym with the pictures I take. </p>

El impacto Con tu ayuda no solo podré mejorar la calidad de mi trabajo, sino que vas a causar un efecto en el mundo del JiuJitsu Brasileño, tanto a nivel nacional, como internacional.  A través de las fotos conseguimos una mayor difusion de nuestro valioso deporte y que los atletas y los miembros de esta comunidad puedan tener buenos recuerdos inmortalizados gratuitos.
 Realmente esto no es un nuevo proyecto, pues el esto lleva en marcha mucho tiempo, pero sí nos va a ayudar a que la difusión y el poder del BJJ sea mayor, llegue más lejos.
En las competiciones, soy el primero en llegar y el último en irme. Y el trabajo no termina ahí, pues cada dia invierto al menos una o dos horas en retocar alguna foto y subo contenido a diario. SOLO CONTENIDO CREADO POR MI.

Es una forma de apoyarme y valorar mi trabajo!

    Riesgos y desafíos
Se que es un proyecto ambicioso al que no puedo hacer frente yo solo, es una muestra de lo que me importa el impacto y la mejora en la comunidad BJJ.
Este equipo me va a permitir hacer realidad muchas ideas, ahora imposibles, que con vuestra ayuda, por muy pequeña que sea, van a hacerlo posible.
    Otras formas en las que puedes ayudar

<h3>About The Project<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>Third Space Art Collective is a group of independent artists, 
performers, and educators striving to further enrich the culture of our 
community by making the creation and exhibition of art and music 
accessible to people regardless of age or economic standing.</p>
<p>We emphasize the ideals of DIY philosophy (Do It Yourself): 
empowering people by providing access to tools, materials, and knowledge
 necessary to become active participants in their creative community. 
Another essential aspect of DIY is recognizing the power of creatively 
repurposing materials which would conventionally be perceived as waste. 
We also emphasize DIT philosophy (Do It Together) – which acknowledges 
the benefits of applying DIY ideas to a collaborative group. </p>
Our goal is threefold: One: to maintain a space to be used as a 
shared and dedicated art studio for collective members. Two: to provide a
 space where our community members can learn and practice skills and 
share ideas. Three: to operate a venue where art and music are showcased<p><span></span></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>To continue offering these amenities, and to ensure that all of our facilities are completely secure and ADA compliant,  3SPAC is reaching out to our community to cover the maintenance and accessibility costs we could not afford otherwise.

Those who oppose us are endeavoring to silence our voices but it is time to show them we will not be silenced.The Confederate Flag Company will create high-quality Confederate Flags and Confederate Flag accessories and apparel so that people are allowed the choice to show their dedication to the history of way of life of the South.We will begin in Fall 2015 by creating high quality Confederate Flags made of heavyweight 2x2-ply mercerized cotton as well as a limited run of Confederate Flag Company Confederate Flag lapel pins. This initial run will be of limited quantity and offered exclusively to our Kickstarter backers.If we are fully funded at $50,000, we will begin production on these high-quality battle flags right here in the South. The money will be used for our materials - we plan to use 100% locally-sourced cotton grown here in the South. We will establish a production facility and create jobs making these high-quality handmade flags. The remainder of the money will be used for distribution, storage, and advertising.STRETCH GOALWe are also proposing a stretch goal of $1,000,000 which would be used to open the Confederate Flag Company flagship store right here in the heart of Dixie - Nashville, Tennessee. There are very high costs associated with opening a storefront, but doing so would allow us to expand our product line to include clothing, lunchboxes, and more.If Amazon, Target, Walmart and others will not offer the products we desire, maybe it's time for us to open a store of our own. With your support, we may be able to do just that.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><p></p><p> I have been enamored by the world of graffiti and street art since I was younger and wanted to create something that would give back to the subculture I grew so fond of. Creating an art supply was the solution I came up with to help out not just graffiti or street artists but all artists. I didn’t want to just open a store that sold art supplies. I wanted to create something more, something better than what is already out there. One of the biggest challenges was finding a location; nothing I found fit for what I wanted to do. Then my super smart and amazing wife suggested “what if we put it in a truck”?  </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center; background-color: initial;"">               </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437951517/qbbxuskqjhi9piw8klwc.jpg"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center; width: 494.666666666667px; height: 265px; background-color: initial;""/></p><p><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: center; color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">                                                       (not the actual truck)</i></p><p>Brilliant! Since then, we have been working towards making this dream a reality and are asking you to help us.</p><p>Jivehouse will be Detroit’s first portable art supply. My goal is to make art supplies more accessible and affordable for artists so they can focus on creating, rather than juggling their time between school and/or work to try and make it to the art supply before they close.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your contribution,
you’re taking part in creating a new and exciting way for artists to get their
supplies. Art is one of our strongest tools for social change. We change entire
communities with it, we engage and inspire our youth with it, and we surround
ourselves with it to give our lives meaning and purpose. You can be a part of
that change and help artists by helping us.</p>
<p>Detroit’s art scene is exploding right now with no signs of
letting up. World renowned artists are paying closer attention to Detroit.
Shepard Fairey had even decided to do the largest mural in his career here.

whole. The creative economy attracts all sorts of people from around the
country and even the world. This benefits everyone in our city and help's bring
change to Detroit on our own terms.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

there are always risks and challenges. Thankfully, we have been able to meet
every challenge with a solution and am certain we will be able to handle

 I have been enamored by the world of graffiti and street art since I was younger and wanted to create something that would give back to the subculture I grew so fond of. Creating an art supply was the solution I came up with to help out not just graffiti or street artists but all artists. I didn’t want to just open a store that sold art supplies. I wanted to create something more, something better than what is already out there. One of the biggest challenges was finding a location; nothing I found fit for what I wanted to do. Then my super smart and amazing wife suggested “what if we put it in a truck”?                                                                        (not the actual truck)Brilliant! Since then, we have been working towards making this dream a reality and are asking you to help us.Jivehouse will be Detroit’s first portable art supply. My goal is to make art supplies more accessible and affordable for artists so they can focus on creating, rather than juggling their time between school and/or work to try and make it to the art supply before they close. To do this, I’m combining the convenience and awesomeness of a food truck with an art supply. We will offer a very diverse selection of supplies from brands artists know and trust. In addition to being an art supply, the truck will function as a mobile mural featuring work form local artists on a rotating schedule. But we need your help to make this happen.Asking strangers to donate their hard earned money over the internet is tough, but what if I told you those few bucks you were gonna spend on a latte or a new shirt could change people’s lives. Think about it. If everybody donated a little and helped this project to get going, it would affect the lives of working artists and the community they live in by offering better and more affordable options for them. What We

I am a 31 year old entrepreneur with a deep passion for art and the joy it can bring to people's lives. I finished college, got my Bachelor's Degree in Marketing, got my Master's Degree in Clinical psychology, and did well as a professional gamer,  but something was still missing. I needed a creative outlet. Something unique in my life that I could express myself while bringing joy to other people through my creations. That was when I had the idea to make Premium Puzzles.  I have completed over seven 3000pc puzzles in 1 year and professionally framed 3 of them. Looking at them I thought that this would make a great business idea. I love the way they came out and want to share them with the world.  I have always considered finished puzzles as an artform. There is just something unique about completed puzzles that allows a deeper appreciation of the image. Please help me spread the word about this underappreciated artform. Together we can share the brilliance of high quality framed finished puzzles with the world! <br/><br/></p>

Doesn't the frame make all the difference?  </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>At Premium Puzzles everything we do is of premium quality from the quality of the puzzles, to the puzzle saving techniques, framing and especially customer service. Here is my dilemma. I am very good at completing puzzles, better than the average person anyway. I finish them pretty quickly but I don't have the funds to get each of them custom framed. I don't want to put junky frames on these puzzles. Only the highest quality frames. I will not settle for less! This is where I need your help. I need at least $2000 dollars to get the other 3000pc puzzles professionally framed. Each 3000pc puzzle is 48 X 32 inches, which is very expensive to custom frame. I actually want all my puzzles professionally framed but the 3000pc ones are of top priority. If I cannot reach my funding goal then I will get some of the smaller 1000pc puzzles framed instead. If I don't have enough to frame the 1000pc ones I will use whatever funds raised to spread the word about Premium Puzzles and puzzles as art &amp; decor. For a new business and revolutionary product I definitely need a significant advertising budget.  Any contributions will also go to a new laptop. My personal laptop is so old. Since I am starting a new business I will definitely need to upgrade my tech. <br/><br/></p>

<br/> <p>This is my only creative outlet. I cannot draw, or paint, or sculpt or write music or take photographs. Putting puzzles together and making them more sophisticated is the only thing I can do and do well. This is my art. The only creation I can make that can bring joy to people's lives. This is why your help is so important. Not only are you helping to bring a new artform to the world, you are sending a message. A message to all other non-artists like me that we can do something creative. That we can create something brilliant that people will love even without having artistic talents. That the art is in their process, their vision, their passion. By helping me make Premium Puzzles a successful business, you inspire a whole population to be their best and be proud of who they are. <br/><br/>You will help me bring my revolutionary artform to people all over the world. This is whole new artform, an entirely different way of seeing and appreciating jigsaw puzzles. They make fabulous wall decor that anyone of all ages can appreciate. I want this to become one of the top 3 artforms alongside paintings and photography.  I cannot do this alone. I need you. <br/><br/></p>

I am trying to set up business relationships with custom framing companies, and advertising any place I can to help get the word out. I am also trying to connect with HGTV and Houzz to really promote puzzles as decor. Even if you own your own business or have an office, decor really sets the mood.

<p>
Sybil's

several artistic services in which to sell and make a living. Sybil's Leaf is an important addition to the tattoo industry being that Reba is highly educated as a certified aesthetician; a skin specialist. This is especially important today when tattoo studios are opening everywhere, employing practitioners with little or no experience. Sybil's Leaf provides the community with an alternative to these parlors and a place to have botched tattoos repaired under the caring hand of a seasoned artist. It's important because it will provide a space to fully utilize many artistic potentials and participate in the community as an economic,
cultural and healthy asset. </p>

Campaign
needs
Acquiring the space at 1105 Mohawk Trail in Shelburne falls incurred the overwhelming costs of starting a business. Although Reba has everything needed to start tattooing as soon as possible  financial resources have been exhausted while we wait for the town inspectors to allow us to open. There are many items that the studio still needs to reach it's fullest potential in serving the community and we need your help!. Why you should support this Campaign

Sybil's
Leaf provide's  a clean, creative space needed for a single parent to produce
several artistic services in which to sell and make a living. Sybil's Leaf is an important addition to the tattoo industry being that Reba is highly educated as a certified aesthetician; a skin specialist. This is especially important today when tattoo studios are opening everywhere, employing practitioners with little or no experience. Sybil's Leaf provides the community with an alternative to these parlors and a place to have botched tattoos repaired under the caring hand of a seasoned artist. It's important because it will provide a space to fully utilize many artistic potentials and participate in the community as an economic,
cultural and healthy asset. 
Sybil's
Leaf will provide artistic services and inspiration for everyone who
walks through the doors. Compassionate, spiritual, experienced and
playful, Reba will strive to make a positive, nurturing impact on everyone who
seeks her services. Sybil's Leaf will also provide a beautiful retail space for local artisans to sell their quality crafts and art from the studio. 
Sybil's Leaf is a harbor
for creativity and a life sustaining force for a small family and a necessary addition to a creative and supportive community.

Please
donate now and help Sybil's Leaf reach her fullest potential!

Thank
you for considering this campaign for your support. If you can't
contribute financially please consider the barter system. The studio can use many items that Reba is willing to barter her services for. Please, take a moment to pass this link on to
folks who might be interested in this campaign.

Blessed
Be.

<p>Hi! My name is Jamel, and I have set up this campaign for my boyfriend, Damien, who has been hand-making and designing real butterfly jewelry for over a decade. His jewelry is extremely unique and ecologically conscious, and will make wonderful holiday gifts for your loved ones. He preserves over 30 of the most stunning butterfly species, supporting small butterfly observatories around the world that raise and study butterflies. This self-taught process took him over two years to perfect the 30 species that he now preserves. His butterfly busines, in turn, helps these observatories with funds needed to keep their doors open. These small observatories also hire indigenous people that live in and around these remote areas, providing much needed sustainable jobs in these regions. For more info, check the FAQs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603130830/zxkrjlmnqoc9f6vzdsms.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Most recently, Damien and I spent a month in Taxco, the silver capital of Mexico, with the goal of finding a small, family-based silversmith to custom make some of his settings. This was an extreme success with the meeting of Masiel, an extremely talented silversmith who lives in the hills of Taxco. Masiel hand mixes and custom makes silver settings for Damien’s higher-end jewelry line. Masiel and his family's main goal is to send their very bright daughter to Canada for college, and Damien would love to be a part of making this happen by being in a position where he can purchase more custom settings from Masiel to preserve his butterflies. By supporting this campaign, Damien can build a stronger partnership with Masiel, along with supporting butterfly observatories that are instrumental in keeping butterfly species flourishing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603131054/ruvwzmrpi2almpwgtcgb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>For over a decade, Damien has been doing art and craft fairs all over the nation. He's a bit of a luddite, and you will not find his work anywhere on the Internet but here. He very much enjoys doing art and craft fairs across the nation, talking to people about butterflies, preservation and his ecologically conscious goal. Of course, like many artists across the nation, this all ended with Covid, and he has an amazing stock of butterfly jewelry that he would love to share with people.</p>
<p>The funds raised from this campaign will allow Damien to continue working on his butterflies and ride out this year's cancelled shows, so his business can survive until outdoor art and craft shows resume. Of course any donation is greatly appreciated, but he would love to offer one of his amazing butterflies in return for your support, and he can make this work through perks starting at $45.  He also will have a $75 and $125 perk, with the higher price points being some of his most complicated and intricate work to date, most of which incorporate Masiel’s custom settings.</p>
<p>Most recently, Damien and I were living and working at Breitenbush Hot Springs, which was decimated by Oregon’s worst wildfires in history, losing both our housing and our jobs (Damien works p/t at the hot springs during the Winter months when he is not doing shows) putting another unforeseen twist in both of our lives.</p>
<p>Your support during these uncertain times will help keep Damien's business alive, while also supporting the butterfly kingdom and keeping Masiel's small family silversmith tradition and business going. Damien will do his best to get your perks delivered by Christmas, if he receives your order within the first two weeks of December. Thank you so much your support, and we hope you enjoy these unique and lovingly crafted pieces!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Lindsey Shaw, and I  am a freelance writer, actor and comedian based in Chicago. For the past two years I have been developing a web series called Mid-to-Late. It's a dark comedy about a (relatively) young woman who is bogged down by life as a struggling creative. She is constantly running from responsibility by way of booze, chasing after unrequited love and excuse-making.</p>
<p>Her struggles are compounded by a feeling of inadequacy compared to younger, more accomplished women. She feels left behind, and an unhealthy preoccupation with social media exacerbates it all. </p>
<p>The series' story arch has been heavily inspired by my real-life struggles with clinical depression and anxiety. As my 30's tick on, and as my mental illness is treated but never eradicated, I am faced with societal pressures—both overt and implicated—financial distress and my ever-present and dwindling biological clock. </p>
<p>Once produced, the series will not only help myself and other passionate, diligent artists achieve a dream, but will also lend much-needed dialogue to topics targeting mental illness and addiction.</p>
<p>Your donation will be an integral and much-appreciated contribution to art, and potential installment to pop culture, that carries messaging around topics that are continuously in need of destigmatization. </p>
<p>To invest time, creative energy and blind, yet visceral belief into an idea that cannot happen until properly funded, is both grueling and exhilarating. I have enough faith in this project to put its future in the  hands of others' donations. </p>
<p>I'm collaborating with Kyle Leland (Kalopsia Films, Cannes Film Festival) who's helping direct and produce, and Noah Laufer (DePaul Theater School graduate, Victory Gardens Theater) as co-writer and director. Both artists continue to generously share their creative input and talents, and I am truly honored to be working with them. </p>
<h3>Why It's So Important to Myself and the World</h3>
<p>Mental illness has been a driving force in the narrative of my life since I was a toddler. From struggling with sharing my mom with her illness and hospital stays, to meeting with school social workers and living a nomadic life when my parents weren't able to care for me—much of who I am and what I identify with has been rooted in self-doubt and fear. Some are drawn to purchasing a house and having perfect credit when mapping out their lives. I've typically been drawn to chaos. It's what I know. Regardless of how unhealthy that path of familiarity has been. </p>
<p>With this web series, I've found a way to transform ongoing mishaps, self-deprecation and mental illness into something resonating and inspirational. </p>
<p>Growing up adjacent to the adverse effects of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, I often felt alone and afraid. With a sick mom and absentee dad, I was in a marginalized group, never really having anyone outside of my family to relate to when it came to the personal trauma I endured. Any time I saw mental illness depicted in the media, it always felt sorely misrepresented. This web series gives me an opportunity to provide the public with the kind of art I would have been eager and relieved to view so to not feel so ostracized. I want others who suffer from mental illness to know they're not ever alone. </p>
<h3>Why Funds are Needed and How Contributions Will be Spent</h3>
<p>As a proverbial ""starving artist"" (literally would take you up on lunch at Chipotle if you offer to buy. There's one right by my therapist's office), funding is needed to professionally produce Mid-to-Late. Once enough money is raised, the series can be shot and edited in order to enter festivals, competitions and even be submitted to executives at major streaming networks. </p>
</div><div>
<p>To shoot this in a worthwhile manner, I need to pay for :</p>
<p>Canon C200 RAW Cinema Camera</p>
<p>Ronin Steadicam</p>
<p>Slider</p>
<p>Tripods + grip materials</p>
<p>Zacuto Shoulder Rigs</p>
<p>Kino Flo lights </p>
<p>Rokinon Cinema Lenses </p>
<p>Intellytech 2x2 Panels</p>
<p>Intellytech Fresnel 1k</p>
<p>(If you don't know what any of this stuff is, don't worry. Just know it costs money to rent and operate!)</p>
<p>Sound editing </p>
<p>Director's cut </p>
<p>Actors' pay and onsite snacks (we definitely need snacks).</p>
<p>Compensation for the stellar film crew I've teamed up with (they've done work that's been featured at the Cannes Film Festival, which is chic and legit!). </p>
<h3>Another Way to Help </h3>
<p>If donating isn't possible, you can share this video to help spread the word of this crowdfunding effort. Tell your friends! Post on your wall (I promise to like it)!</p>
<h3>Thanks for Visiting! </h3>

From struggling with sharing my mom with her illness and hospital stays, to meeting with school social workers and living a nomadic life when my parents weren't able to care for me—much of who I am and what I identify with has been rooted in self-doubt and fear. Some are drawn to purchasing a house and having perfect credit when mapping out their lives. I've typically been drawn to chaos. It's what I know. Regardless of how unhealthy that path of familiarity has been. 
With this web series, I've found a way to transform ongoing mishaps, self-deprecation and mental illness into something resonating and inspirational. 
Growing up adjacent to the adverse effects of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, I often felt alone and afraid. With a sick mom and absentee dad, I was in a marginalized group, never really having anyone outside of my family to relate to when it came to the personal trauma I endured. Any time I saw mental illness depicted in the media, it always felt sorely misrepresented. This web series gives me an opportunity to provide the public with the kind of art I would have been eager and relieved to view so to not feel so ostracized. I want others who suffer from mental illness to know they're not ever alone. 
Why Funds are Needed and How Contributions Will be Spent
As a proverbial ""starving artist"" (literally would take you up on lunch at Chipotle if you offer to buy. There's one right by my therapist's office), funding is needed to professionally produce Mid-to-Late. Once enough money is raised, the series can be shot and edited in order to enter festivals, competitions and even be submitted to executives at major streaming networks. 

To shoot this in a worthwhile manner, I need to pay for :
Canon C200 RAW Cinema Camera
Ronin Steadicam
Slider
Tripods + grip materials
Zacuto Shoulder Rigs
Kino Flo lights 
Rokinon Cinema Lenses 
Intellytech 2x2 Panels
Intellytech Fresnel 1k
(If you don't know what any of this stuff is, don't worry. Just know it costs money to rent and operate!)
Sound editing 
Director's cut 
Actors' pay and onsite snacks (we definitely need snacks).
Compensation for the stellar film crew I've teamed up with (they've done work that's been featured at the Cannes Film Festival, which is chic and legit!). 
Another Way to Help 
If donating isn't possible, you can share this video to help spread the word of this crowdfunding effort. Tell your friends! Post on your wall (I promise to like it)!

<p>Le <strong>principe de la lévitation électromagnétique</strong> est de chercher à compenser le poids de l’objet par une force créée par un très grand aimant, un circuit intégré servant de coordinateur et des bobines électriques servant de stabilisateur. Cette compensation de la gravité permet la lévitation – élévation et le maintien de l'objet en l’air sans l'intervention d'un quelconque appui.</p>
<p><strong>Les bénéfices de la technologie :</strong></p>

<li>Complètement <strong>silencieux</strong>
</li>
<li>Système enfin <strong>abordable </strong>(les premiers prototypes s'élevaient à plus de 500€/unité)</li>

<p>Nous devons exposer nos produits mais créer un magasin est beaucoup trop coûteux au départ... Nous mettrons en place un système d'ambassadeur dans les plus grandes villes de France afin que vous puissiez visualiser le produit proche de chez vous !</p>

</div></div>","Home Gravity est une start-up française et familiale, qui développe une grande diversité de produits design en lévitation. Notre art décoratif est issu de la meilleure technologie électromagnétique. Pour cette aventure mère & fils, Home Gravity a besoin de vous pour vous faire découvrir une grande diversité de produits en lévitation ET surtout créer de nouveaux prototypes innovants ! 
 

 
Toute la presse parle de la lévitation ! Suivez notre actualité, nous allons être publié chez plusieurs blogueurs et journaux reconnus dans les prochains jours !
Presskit
 

 
Home Gravity s’est construite autour de la passion du design et de l’art. En effet, la lévitation est un mystère car c’est un art décoratif incontestable dès le premier coup d’œil !
 
Notre équipe 
Léo est le fondateur du projet. Il a obtenu un DUT Techniques de Commercialisation, une Licence Economie et Gestion et un Diplôme Universitaire Entrepreneur. De par sa formation, il s'occupe de la partie digitale (site internet, campagne de crowdfunding, logo, vidéos, photos etc.) et de toute la partie commercialisation, marketing et communication.
Patricia a été initiée par son fils et elle est tombée amoureuse de la lévitation. Elle a toujours été passionnée par l'art et l'artisanat. Longtemps, elle a exprimé sa créativité pour l'élaboration de nombreux vitraux alsaciens avec un maître verrier. Patricia conseille sur le choix des coloris, la forme des produits, les vases et les plantes...
Mais elle a toujours eu un tempérament bien trempé avec son passé de chauffeuse de poids lourd, convoyeuse de fonds armé, pilote de prototypes automobile ou encore marchal en aéroport (placement des avions). Son expertise dans la logistique/distribution sera très importante pour Home Gravity.
 

 
Home Gravity est le premier distributeur français de produits en lévitation. Son objectif est de rassembler l’ensemble des produits en apesanteur sur une même plateforme en ligne (www.home-gravity.com).
Nous proposons dès maintenant de nombreuses gammes :
Gamme GARDEN GRAVITY

 
Gamme LIGHT GRAVITY
 
A chaque toucher vous aurez le choix entre 3 modes différents d'éclairage :- Eclairage de l'abat-jour- Eclairage du pied en aluminium- Eclairage de l'abat-jour et du pied en aluminium
La lampe reste en lévitation même éteinte !
 
Gamme SYSTEM GRAVITY

Vous voulez voir plus de nos produits ? Alors allez dans la rubrique ""CONTREPARTIES"" ou visitez notre première version de notre site internet : www.home-gravity.com
 

 
Nous avons pour ambition d'élargir en 2017 notre gamme en créant de nouveaux produits jamais vu en collaborant avec les ingénieurs spécialisés dans les sciences de la technologie électromagnétique. 
Nous sommes actuellement en recherche & développement pour développer de nombreuses nouveautés. Dans un premier temps, nous allons travailler de nouvelles matières pour les bases, les abats-jour et les vases. Dans un second temps, nous allons associer la technologie par induction afin de pouvoir faire léviter des objets électrique dans les airs comme une recharge pour vos manettes (PS4, XBOX...), smartphones, tablettes etc. Nous allons déclinez cette association technologique en produit design hi-tech pour toujours aller plus loin dans la lévitation !
N.B.: Nous ne pouvons pas encore vous en dire plus mais suivez nous sur les réseaux sociaux pour être informé de nos nouvelles créations !
 

 
La qualité d'un produit commence par son emballage ! Nous avons fait le choix de sélectionner la boite en bois comme deuxième peau de la plante en lévitation. En effet, le côté nature est visible au premier coups d’œil !
Idéal pour un cadeau : l'emballage est la première chose que l'on voit !

La boite est également très solide et permet de laisser l'air bonsaï intact !

 

 
Le principe de la lévitation électromagnétique est de chercher à compenser le poids de l’objet par une force créée par un très grand aimant, un circuit intégré servant de coordinateur et des bobines électriques servant de stabilisateur. Cette compensation de la gravité permet la lévitation – élévation et le maintien de l'objet en l’air sans l'intervention d'un quelconque appui.
Les bénéfices de la technologie :

Complètement silencieux

Système enfin abordable (les premiers prototypes s'élevaient à plus de 500€/unité)
Technologie simple d'utilisation (mamie peut le faire, vous aussi !)

 

 
Suivez l'avancement de notre start-up depuis ses débuts. Nous avons déjà fait du chemin et c'est avec vous que nous allons continuer l'aventure!

 

 
Vous pouvez voir dans ce graphique comment se répartit votre financement.
Par exemple, pour 100€ récoltés, 58€ sont utilisés pour fabriquer votre contrepartie, 4€ pour l'emballage, 6€ pour le transport etc.

 
 

 
C'est grâce à vous que nous pourrons avancer ! A chaque pallier de financement, nous pourrons développer pas à pas notre start-up, voici nos objectifs et ce que nous ferons avec votre aide !

<p>My name is Elena Cremona; I am an environmental and landscape photographer graduated from the Arts University Bournemouth and currently based in London. My latest project, scheduled to launch in early January, is a collaborative print publication that focuses on the intersection between fine art and environmentalism. My aim is to launch a platform for both emerging and established artists to express their thoughts on current environmental issues, through a wide range of creative media.</p>
<p>Our first print publication, “The Earth Issue,” will be created in collaboration with Archive Collective Magazine, a multidisciplinary digital magazine founded in Montreal with a readership of over 10,000 artists and creative professionals. Together, we have identified the growing interest amongst young artists to to awaken society’s complacent consciousness; to inspire, and harness the power of community to drive social change. There is a shared desire amongst the global creative youth to ignite a sense of urgency in regards to the environment, and our relationship to it. We believe this desire must be nurtured and cultivated, in the common pursuit of preserving nature for the generations to come.</p>
<h3>We are currently seeking sponsorship from organizations and individuals to expand our launch into a series of exhibitions, educational conferences and workshops. </h3>
<p><br/><strong>Description of the contents of the publication:</strong><br/>The Earth Issue will include the writings and images of 29 artists, with a common goal of honouring nature through their works, and inspiring other artists to use art as a channel for environmental activism. The projects featured in this issue span across various creative disciplines, from photography to painting, ceramic sculpture, poetry, and illustration.</p>
<p><strong>Why we are asking for sponsorship:</strong><br/>The worlds needs to engage in healthy debate about Climate Change and we believe art is the best way to encourage that.<br/>With a little help from like-minded organizations, readers, and friends, we hope to expand our issue launch into a hub for learning, sharing, and empowering. The launch event will be held in London, where we aim to put together conferences on climate change, activism, photography, and creative impact. </p>

<p>Founded in 1999, Wigtown Book Festival is now one of the UK's best-loved literary events. From 21-30 September, we celebrate our 20th anniversary and we're having a 10-day party. With more than 250 events, including some of the nation's most interesting writers, as well as theatre, film and music, there's something for the whole family. As well as events for adults, we have two dedicated programmes for children 0-13 and for young people aged 14-25.</p>
<p>“Wigtown may only have a population of 1000, but Wigtown doesn’t just punch above its weight when it comes to attracting big-name authors to its annual book festival, it punches above pretty much everybody else’s weight, too.” Roger Cox, The Scotsman</p>
<p>Events for children are at the heart of Wigtown Book Festival. In our 20<sup>th</sup> year we want to introduce the new face and mascot of Wigtown Children’s Festival. Drawn by illustrator Claudia Boldt, the legendary beast is large, hairy, friendlier than the related Yeti and above all inquisitive. But we have a problem – our Big Wig is stuck on the page. We need him brought to life and able to interact, entertain and inspire the youngest of our festival-goers. We have our illustration but we need your help to bring our mascot to life with a custom-made costume.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need £1,500 to make our mascot costume and create some custom Big Wig goodies including t-shirts, button badges and fridge magnets so that children and families can take a little piece of Big Wig Festival home. Our mascot will be available throughout the festival for photographs as a great reminder of the joy of reading and experience of authors bringing characters to life at Wigtown Book Festival.</p>
<p>We'll keep backers up to date over the 30 days with Big Wig rhymes and stories and and promise each backer who donates £2 or more their very own Big Wig badge to wear with pride. Backers will be invited to Big Wig Festival on Sunday 30 September to meet Big Wig for themselves.</p>
<p>If we don't reach the goal, we'll prioritise the mascot and the backer pin badges. If we exceed our goal, we'll put any additional funds towards future children's and young people's events to continue to inspire our youngest readers and writers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help bring this lovable, huggable character to life for all our festival visitors. Meeting our authors, hearing their stories and seeing them bring their characters to life from the page has a huge impact on children, developing their imagination and their sense of what is possible. We know that Big Wig will help us achieve this more and more each year.</p>
<p>Wigtown Festival Company has never run a crowdfunding project before - this is all new territory for us - but we have won a number of awards, including: the Sunday Herald Scottish Culture Awards 2018 Cultural Event of the Year; an Arts &amp; Business Scotland Award; and a Scottish Thistle Award.  We also promise to spend your contribution responsibly for the purposes detailed here, with any excess funding dedicated to supporting literary projects for young readers and writers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Without your support, we won't be able to bring Big Wig from the page and create a lovable, huggable character for children to meet, read to and experience Wigtown Book Festival with. We know that bringing characters to life has a huge impact on imagination and wealth of experience and hope you'll support us to bring Big Wig to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can afford to support financially, but you can still help by spreading the word about our Big Wig mascot campaign and about the festival itself. We want to maximise the number of children, young people and families who can experience the festival for themselves and would be delighted if you'd share our website (<a href=""http://www.wigtownbookfestival.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.wigtownbookfestival.com</a>) and Facebook details so no one misses the opportunity to take part and meet Big Wig for themselves.

<h3>The Background</h3>
<p>My name is William Goetz and I run a small business in Washington State that focuses on recreating historical crafts from the Viking Era as well as sourcing high quality historical textiles for reenactors and those who simply appreciate the beauty and history of these crafts. I personally have been blacksmithing for about six years and silversmithing for the last two. I've found my passion in these crafts in addition to my living history pursuits, and I am wanting to take the next step in expanding my business to further establish myself.</p>
<p>This campaign is for several purposes: I want to build out my stock of items while having more freedom to work with new techniques and styles, I want to upgrade my shop with new tools and equipment, I want to build my own website and I want to travel to Scandinavia to get a first-hand look at some of the artifacts that I am faithfully reproducing while seeing some historical sites and potentially networking with other crafters in the living history community. These are things that I aim to accomplish regardless of anything else, but with a boost from those who support my work I can accomplish these goals and take my business to the next level much sooner than without.</p>

<h3>Desires and Rewards</h3>
<p>I am looking to raise $2000 to cover the costs of these pursuits. This will cover my goals in order of:</p>
<p>$525 for buying silver and other crafting materials as well as historical reproduction silks,</p>
<p>$150 for outfitting my shop with better tools as well as a better casting setup,</p>
<p>$200 for setting up my own independent website,</p>
<p>$700 for making a trip to Scandinavia to go to museums and historical sites and get a close-up and in-person look at these ancient sources,</p>
<p>$425 to cover taxes, fees and perk materials. This obviously scales down if total contributions are lower.</p>
<p>Any donation is much appreciated and goes to help my cause, and for those who feel like donating more they will get the following tokens of my thanks. For style choices, see the photos at the top.</p>
<p>$10 or more gets a 15% off coupon to my shop which can be applied to any item.</p>
<p>$50 or more gets a pendant of your choice in sterling silver.</p>
<p>$70 or more gets a ring of your choice in sterling silver and sized to your preference.</p>
<p>$140 or more gets a flat style arm ring (bracelet) of your choice in fine silver.</p>
<p>$150 or more gets an open style arm ring (bracelet) of your choice in sterling silver.</p>
<p>$180 or more gets a closed style arm ring (bracelet) of your choice in sterling silver. This requires a measurement around the hand to make sure that it fits correctly.</p>
<p>These rewards do not stack, but third tier or above may choose to add a pendant onto their reward at no cost. Please provide shipping address. For international shipments, please be aware that there may be import taxes collected upon pickup. I do not collect them so I cannot say for sure. Depending on volume of rewards, please allow up to 6-7 weeks for shipment.</p>
<p>While raising enough to finance my stock building and travel would be amazing, even a lower amount would still greatly help. If I do not meet the total goal I will still be putting the money raised into buying materials and upgrading my shop and, depending on the amount, setting some aside as a boost for my travel and research goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My art brings history to the modern world in a way that allows people to have and wear pieces of the past. I highly value education and I always share my research, so the customer knows that what they're getting is genuine and gets to know the story behind it. With your support and my goals met I can greatly increase the effectiveness of these endeavors. </p>
<p>My quality speaks for itself with regard to my commitment to authentic reconstruction. My solid 5-star Etsy rating and work with several shops as well as the Nordic Museum in Seattle are examples of this. Supporting my project means helping to keep historical crafts alive in the here and now.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you want to support my project, but don't have the ability to contribute financially, sharing this and helping to bring it to more people's attention is still incredibly helpful and appreciated. Every bit helps!</p>
</div></div>","The Background
My name is William Goetz and I run a small business in Washington State that focuses on recreating historical crafts from the Viking Era as well as sourcing high quality historical textiles for reenactors and those who simply appreciate the beauty and history of these crafts. I personally have been blacksmithing for about six years and silversmithing for the last two. I've found my passion in these crafts in addition to my living history pursuits, and I am wanting to take the next step in expanding my business to further establish myself.
This campaign is for several purposes: I want to build out my stock of items while having more freedom to work with new techniques and styles, I want to upgrade my shop with new tools and equipment, I want to build my own website and I want to travel to Scandinavia to get a first-hand look at some of the artifacts that I am faithfully reproducing while seeing some historical sites and potentially networking with other crafters in the living history community.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Gangsapura was founded in 2016 with a sole mission to promote, to elevate the value and to bring awareness about the existence of our traditional Malay gamelan. With that in mind, Gangsapura started reaching out to the public community through workshops and showcases and started to spark the interest of the young generation.</p>Keeping up the momentum is the key to making Malay gamelan be a part of our norm, and we need your help to make this possible.<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for supporters to help us achieve USD 25,000 to purchase Malay gamelan instruments from Solo, Indonesia. Currently, we are struggling to keep Malay gamelan alive without having our own space and instruments.</p>
<p>We work with organizations, schools, and individuals that already own Malay gamelan instruments within their compound. However, our vision is to make Malay gamelan as easily accessible as possible. We vision our space to be publicly available for the public to access and learn about Malay gamelan that once was kept hidden from the public eyes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>On the 22nd March 2019, we released two Malay gamelan albums on international music streaming platforms and it was the first ever Malay gamelan album to ever made it to platforms like Spotify, iTunes, Amazon Music, Youtube and many more.</p>
<p>This is a huge milestone for Malay gamelan as it can be the point of reference for all Malay gamelan musicians and easily accessible tracks for all lovers and enthusiasts, all over the world.</p>
<p>We plan to give more, year in and year out. With our own space and instruments, we are looking into creating more contemporary songs and albums, collaborating with multiple artists across the nation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Malay gamelan instruments are handmade from bronze and it can only be made by the masters in Solo, Indonesia, making it a very expensive and exclusive set of instrument to own. We are looking forward to making it more open to the public, to ensure more public awareness of the artform, and further elevate the value of Malay gamelan in our culture.</p>

<p>A Home after 40 years!</p>
<p>Imagine a non-profit arts association which provides its members with community, networking, education and public representation opportunities - all without a physical space - for 4 decades! No more! In October of 2018, Toronto Potters is setting up a studio in Artscape Youngplace, a clay-hub in the heart of downtown Toronto!</p>
<p>This 1000 sq. ft. space will offer individual artists the opportunity to focus on their work. It will allow Toronto Potters to host artists’ workshops, presentations and engage with the local community through classes and programming.</p>
<h2>What We Need:</h2>
<p>We are fundraising $15,000 to cover the studio start-up expenses. Our volunteers are collecting donations of tools and materials, but we need financial support to assist with the expenses of additional equipment and skilled trade services needed to set up the studio, first and last month rent deposit and materials to begin running classes. With your generosity, once the studio is up and running, Toronto Potters will be able to sustain this endeavour by generating income from studio memberships, workshops and classes.</p>
<h3>The budget:</h3>
<p>$7000 rent (first and last month deposit)<br/>$750 Shelving<br/>$750 Worktables<br/>$2500 Electrician, Plumbing &amp; Carpenter services<br/>$1250 Kiln rewiring to 208volt<br/>$500 Glazes for Classes<br/>$500 Clay for Classes<br/>$150 Small Tools for Classes<br/>$800 Indiegogo Fee<br/>$800 Transaction processing fees</p>

<h2>
<br/>The Results</h2>
<p>Creating this new clay studio in the heart of Toronto will have an immense positive effect! With unaffordable overheads, many artists are unable to have their own spaces and maintain studio practices. Your contribution fosters the future of the arts with a shared studio that is not only advantageous to clay artists, but also to the community as a whole. Toronto Potters wants to ensure that the quality of life experienced through the arts survives the education cutbacks and high cost of living.</p>
<p>Toronto Potters Studio will provide communal studio space for over 20 artists. It will run classes and workshops for the public ranging from introductory level to advanced, open to all ages. A year-round micro gallery featuring work from our members, plus opportunities for exhibitions and pop up markets throughout the year will add to the programming Toronto Potters already offers.

<p><strong>About Cathy Hill</strong></p>
<p>I am an artist, who has been living, working, raising children and exhibiting in Egerton, Kent, for over 25 years. With a sock-knitting needle and a tin of wax-oil crayons I create pictures that are intended to uplift and inspire my viewers about “What is magical in our every-day lives?”</p>
<p>It is <strong>extremely exciting</strong>  for me, to be having this big exhibition of my work, in the beautiful town of Whitstable this October (5th-14th 2018)</p>
<p>The Show is <strong>interactive,</strong> providing free art workshops for school children. Visitors will be creating a collaborative, community artwork with me and will visit the special space to contemplate the <strong>'magical'.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537607017/hanszjsoqzgcabmsv2ju.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It is time that I burst forth, with my colourful artwork, into the wider world because I have a plan... and am passionate about <strong>helping non academic children</strong> realise their own unique talents, potential and possibilities for creating a <strong>happy and successful life.</strong></p>
<p>During my work with children, I was <strong>deeply moved</strong> by a 7 year old boy, who believed that he was a total failure. He couldn't learn academically and said to me ""I'm no good at nuffink"", but the two of us would sing together and he had an amazing voice and ability to dance!  No-one knew, he didn't even know himself, however when told, no-one was able to take any action.</p>
<p>Through sharing my ideas  for <strong>""It's a Magical Life!""</strong> and about this young lad, I found a sponsor and a singing/dancing tutor for him. There are many children out there, with talents that need some nurturing and I would like to help.</p>

<p><strong>I aim to raise £7,777 </strong> to fund the exhibition and this campaign; from Gallery fees and insurance to printing and posting; from staffing and running the show, to workshop materials and wine for the preview.</p>

<h2><strong>ARTHUB needs you!</strong></h2>
<p>We are probably the largest independent visual artist communitiy in Bucharest with a venue of it’s own. We run a beautiful, luminous space of 600 sqm in the heart of the city. We are proud to host and represent 23 resident artists and 10 active permanent guests. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517825991/khsspfeojkx3jc0ykvdy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We need your help to pass through the hardest part of our journey so far. We are in a point where all our personal resources are gone, our organization is in debt and our space is not yet fully functional in order to be self sustained. After two years of investment and one year of working, the fate of our hub is in your hands. It's activity could continue in order to serve artistic community and the public in Bucharest or it may just stop because of the lack of resources. </p>
<p>Buy our works of art (it really is a great investment!), our prints, books, catalogues or calendars. Attend our guided tours and our art classes for children or adults (they are probably the best in town), come to our talks and lectures, have fun at our parties! Choose one of the so many means to get connected to our cause and, stick to us, we are going to make real, good quality contemporary art something friendly and easy to relate to. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Want to know more? </strong></h3>
<p>ARTHUB was established in march 2013 by Associatiation for Contemporary Art Promotion. Starting june 2016 we began our activity at our present address: 61, Carol I Blvd, Bucharest, the 4th floor (Latin Market Building). We run 11 individual art studios, 2 shared spaces for art and art related activities and a small coffee shop for events only.</p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517824706/zyr3b0xskupzyjy3eqni.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>When entering our venue, in June 2016, there was no running water, no electrical net nor an electrical connection. For six long months we have made the empty deserted place a space for art. We have done the repartitioning of the space, the electric network, a water installation and many other things like painting the walls. Except the elements that needend professional authorisation, we did most of the work ourselves. The total investment in ARTHUB is 78.000 euro so far (rent costs included). 97,6% of the money came from the initiators of the project and from ARTHUB members while just 2,4% came from public funding.  During the whole period of working no member of the Associatiation for Contemporary Art Promotion did receive sallary nor any kind of fee for running the project. So it is a 100% volunteer work project. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517824835/p3ktro1nxk4olmgouymz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We hope you understand why ARTHUB is so valuable for all of us, in here. All the artists who run their studios in ARTHUB consider it their home away from home. It is a place where we meet and we have real dialogues. It is a great opportunity for public to meet the artists in their environment. We are an art school, an art gallery, a place to hang out and a co-working hub, all together. </p>
<p>When fully functional ARTHUB has tens of services and art products to offer to the market in order to increase it's sustainability. But for each and every product or service we want to offer there is something not woring yet that still needs a little more investment. We are 85% done but the 15% left is keeping us down. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517825350/tkphk1lg9ta4nubvwq4n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Why does it matter so much?</h3>
<p>All these are things that matter for us. But there is also a bigger picture, maybe the most important thing about ARTHUB's survival is the fact that it's existance is and will be a precedent. Artistic public policy in Romania will have to take it's case in consideration when talking about the art studio issue. If ARTHUB works, it means that it's model could become successful and replicated or scaled to other venues by other organizations in order to solve the  problem of art studios vacancy in Bucharest. </p>
<p>This is why by supporting ARTHUB, in fact you support the entire system around visual art in Romania, a system that does not work but could be fixed by initiatives like ours. So buy our art, order our collectibles, reserve your seat at our events and subscribe to our educational programs. </p>
<p>All of us here at ARTHUB thank you so much and will keep you in our hearts and on our walls in order to be charished for the rest of our existance as a cultural venue. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In 2017 we began with 3 rented studios in February to get to ”no vacancy” in November. All the months in which we were still developing our space we paid a huge rent.  From now on we are able to pay the rent but we need to get up to date. It is important and urgent! </p>

<p>Since we started ARTHUB, 98% of the funds we invested were from personal funds of initiators and members and 2% came from a public grant. Meaning we invested our salaries in this project for the last two years.  But at the end of last year we did not receive the salaries for the last 6 month of work in 2017. It was friends and collaborators that borrowed us the money we needed in order to keep the space alive and continue. Now we have to get to zero in order to continue our project and our lives. </p>

<p>The two most important things we miss are the two facilities without which we cannot move further. We have tree studios with no opening windows. We have to install opening systems in order to be able to ventilate all our spaces.  And the second bathroom. It is almost done. We have the room for the toilets and the sanitary installation but we need to bring the water in the rear part of the building, create a water reserve and install a water heating device. </p>

<p>Next things on our list are finishing our common spaces. It includes insulating the sealing, installing electricity to those areas and gallery lights.

<p>And the last but not the least important is a little help in paying our last electricity and accountancy bills. After the long and difficult year of 2017 we had difficulties in paying these running costs that no grant accepts covering. </p>

</div></div>","ARTHUB needs you!
We are probably the largest independent visual artist communitiy in Bucharest with a venue of it’s own. We run a beautiful, luminous space of 600 sqm in the heart of the city. We are proud to host and represent 23 resident artists and 10 active permanent guests. 

We need your help to pass through the hardest part of our journey so far. We are in a point where all our personal resources are gone, our organization is in debt and our space is not yet fully functional in order to be self sustained. After two years of investment and one year of working, the fate of our hub is in your hands. It's activity could continue in order to serve artistic community and the public in Bucharest or it may just stop because of the lack of resources. 
Buy our works of art (it really is a great investment!), our prints, books, catalogues or calendars. Attend our guided tours and our art classes for children or adults (they are probably the best in town), come to our talks and lectures, have fun at our parties! Choose one of the so many means to get connected to our cause and, stick to us, we are going to make real, good quality contemporary art something friendly and easy to relate to. 
 
Want to know more? 
ARTHUB was established in march 2013 by Associatiation for Contemporary Art Promotion. Starting june 2016 we began our activity at our present address: 61, Carol I Blvd, Bucharest, the 4th floor (Latin Market Building). We run 11 individual art studios, 2 shared spaces for art and art related activities and a small coffee shop for events only.

When entering our venue, in June 2016, there was no running water, no electrical net nor an electrical connection. For six long months we have made the empty deserted place a space for art. We have done the repartitioning of the space, the electric network, a water installation and many other things like painting the walls. Except the elements that needend professional authorisation, we did most of the work ourselves. The total investment in ARTHUB is 78.000 euro so far (rent costs included). 97,6% of the money came from the initiators of the project and from ARTHUB members while just 2,4% came from public funding.  During the whole period of working no member of the Associatiation for Contemporary Art Promotion did receive sallary nor any kind of fee for running the project. So it is a 100% volunteer work project. 

We hope you understand why ARTHUB is so valuable for all of us, in here. All the artists who run their studios in ARTHUB consider it their home away from home. It is a place where we meet and we have real dialogues. It is a great opportunity for public to meet the artists in their environment. We are an art school, an art gallery, a place to hang out and a co-working hub, all together. 
When fully functional ARTHUB has tens of services and art products to offer to the market in order to increase it's sustainability. But for each and every product or service we want to offer there is something not woring yet that still needs a little more investment. We are 85% done but the 15% left is keeping us down. 

Why does it matter so much?
All these are things that matter for us. But there is also a bigger picture, maybe the most important thing about ARTHUB's survival is the fact that it's existance is and will be a precedent. Artistic public policy in Romania will have to take it's case in consideration when talking about the art studio issue. If ARTHUB works, it means that it's model could become successful and replicated or scaled to other venues by other organizations in order to solve the  problem of art studios vacancy in Bucharest. 
This is why by supporting ARTHUB, in fact you support the entire system around visual art in Romania, a system that does not work but could be fixed by initiatives like ours. So buy our art, order our collectibles, reserve your seat at our events and subscribe to our educational programs. 
All of us here at ARTHUB thank you so much and will keep you in our hearts and on our walls in order to be charished for the rest of our existance as a cultural venue.

The video above should give you a good idea of the process and the product, and I’ve written about it several times on my blog (for example, here <a href=""https://deborahsemeldemirtas.com/2015/12/30/predictions-predictions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>https://deborahsemeldemirtas.com/2015/12/30/predictions-predictions/</a> , here <a href=""https://deborahsemeldemirtas.com/2016/07/12/prognostication/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://deborahsemeldemirtas.com/2016/07/12/prognostication/)</a> and here <a href=""https://deborahsemeldemirtas.com/2018/02/05/pick-a-card/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://deborahsemeldemirtas.com/2018/02/05/pick-a-card/</a>).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520513754/jwbvmruo7bbvdcy9qtmt.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>As I explain in my blog posts, I started telling fortunes by “reading” my collages because I found that people were more interested in looking at the artwork when I could help them to find “a way in” through fortunetelling.</p><p>Sadly, most of us are so busy with the dramas of our daily lives that art is something we think of as a luxury rather than something that satisfies a fundamental human need. Art can be inspirational, but it can also be challenging, especially when it is artwork that demands our thoughtful time and attention.</p><p>I think this has a lot to do with the fact that most of us have lost any expectations that a work of art – particularly a work of so-called “contemporary art” – might hold any relevance for us in our daily lives. By contrast, we tend to be thrilled when someone - a fortuneteller, for example - can tell us something about ourselves. (Of course, good art does that, too!) So, I decided to “change the paradigm” from one of “finding meaning in an image as a work of art” to one of “finding meaning in an image as a fortunetelling card”. And by this very simple change in approach, I’ve been able to make connections, through art, with people who were complete strangers, and to build closer relationships with people who I knew, but not necessarily very well, and to create a situation that would allow them to get the pleasure of looking at artwork in a way that was meaningful to them.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520522439/xsntoiax5vtih5mxu5kh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>So, in other words...</h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>Art Fortunes is an object. </strong></i>To be precise, it’s 52 collages, each 10x15cm. I started making them when I noticed the incredible amount of paper that was accumulating in my studio: invitations to past exhibits, colour photocopies of old work, sketchbooks filled with sketches from museums, travels, etc., and the ever-growing pile of “junk” papers, from advertising bills stuck on my car windshield to “interesting” packing and packaging materials. I thought it would be ecologically beneficial to make artwork that recycled all this old paper instead of consuming new and sometimes hazardous material, and I also liked the idea of “cannabalizing” my old work to make new work.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>Art Fortunes is an action. </strong></i>So, once you’ve got the cards, what do you do with them? Well, you could frame them and hang them on your walls, or give them away as presents for other people to hang on their walls. But if you ask me, the best thing to do with them is to put them into action as a tool for communicating with other people. So, in fact...</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>Art Fortunes is an interaction. </strong></i>You can use the deck of Art Fortunes to ‘read’ someone’s future. It’s really very simple and fun and extremely rewarding because it lets you enter into a one-on-one conversation with someone you might not know very well or even at all. Ideally, it’s a non-commercial interaction with another person in a public space – which is important, considering how few opportunities we have left for this!.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">You can check out the links above to find out more about how I’ve done ‘readings’, and I’m including an informative (although brief and abstract) ‘User’s Guide’ with most of the campaign ‘perks’. What’s more, when you look over the ‘perks’, you’ll see that one of them is a ‘reading’ via Skype. (In keeping with the non-commercial spirit I’ve described, rather than ask for the reading for yourself, I'd rather you give it to a friend. And on this point, full disclosure: I have been given money for doing readings at an event, but the payment was from the organizer, so that none of the people who got readings had to pay for them; I’ve done readings for charity, so while the people being ‘read’ had to pay, they didn’t pay me; and recently I have had a few people voluntarily chip in to subsidize a beer or a coffee at a local cafe in exchange for readings, but I wouldn't want to make it a habit...)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520522265/udqcjac12gyqpzmf9l4j.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>What's this campaign about?</h3><p>I like this work so much that I want to share it with as many people as possible, and I decided the best way to do this (beyond simply performing “readings” myself) would be through an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign that will allow me to print and distribute a limited edition of 60 “decks” of “Art Fortunes” for other people to use.</p><p>I can think of three reasons why you might want to support this project: 1. You get to enjoy the artwork on your very own deck of Art Fortunes; 2. You can use the deck of “collage cards” to “tell fortunes” and connect with other people; and 3. You’ll be helping me to share my work and support me in creating more of it.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>The 3 things you 'get' when you support this project:</i></strong></h3><ul>

I hope you'll consider funding ""Art Fortunes"" yourself and/or sharing this campaign with others. If you've got any questions, just drop me a line...</p></div>","What is ""Art Fortunes"" ?That's a good question! In fact, the concept is simple, but it's kind of hard to explain. The video above should give you a good idea of the process and the product, and I’ve written about it several times on my blog (for example, here https://deborahsemeldemirtas.com/2015/12/30/predictions-predictions/ , here https://deborahsemeldemirtas.com/2016/07/12/prognostication/) and here https://deborahsemeldemirtas.com/2018/02/05/pick-a-card/).As I explain in my blog posts, I started telling fortunes by “reading” my collages because I found that people were more interested in looking at the artwork when I could help them to find “a way in” through fortunetelling.Sadly, most of us are so busy with the dramas of our daily lives that art is something we think of as a luxury rather than something that satisfies a fundamental human need. Art can be inspirational, but it can also be challenging, especially when it is artwork that demands our thoughtful time and attention.I think this has a lot to do with the fact that most of us have lost any expectations that a work of art – particularly a work of so-called “contemporary art” – might hold any relevance for us in our daily lives. By contrast, we tend to be thrilled when someone - a fortuneteller, for example - can tell us something about ourselves. (Of course, good art does that, too!) So, I decided to “change the paradigm” from one of “finding meaning in an image as a work of art” to one of “finding meaning in an image as a fortunetelling card”. And by this very simple change in approach, I’ve been able to make connections, through art, with people who were complete strangers, and to build closer relationships with people who I knew, but not necessarily very well, and to create a situation that would allow them to get the pleasure of looking at artwork in a way that was meaningful to them.So, in other words...Art Fortunes is an object. To be precise, it’s 52 collages, each 10x15cm. I started making them when I noticed the incredible amount of paper that was accumulating in my studio: invitations to past exhibits, colour photocopies of old work, sketchbooks filled with sketches from museums, travels, etc., and the ever-growing pile of “junk” papers, from advertising bills stuck on my car windshield to “interesting” packing and packaging materials. I thought it would be ecologically beneficial to make artwork that recycled all this old paper instead of consuming new and sometimes hazardous material, and I also liked the idea of “cannabalizing” my old work to make new work.Art Fortunes is an action. So, once you’ve got the cards, what do you do with them? Well, you could frame them and hang them on your walls, or give them away as presents for other people to hang on their walls. But if you ask me, the best thing to do with them is to put them into action as a tool for communicating with other people. So, in fact...Art Fortunes is an interaction. You can use the deck of Art Fortunes to ‘read’ someone’s future. It’s really very simple and fun and extremely rewarding because it lets you enter into a one-on-one conversation with someone you might not know very well or even at all. Ideally, it’s a non-commercial interaction with another person in a public space – which is important, considering how few opportunities we have left for this!.You can check out the links above to find out more about how I’ve done ‘readings’, and I’m including an informative (although brief and abstract) ‘User’s Guide’ with most of the campaign ‘perks’. What’s more, when you look over the ‘perks’, you’ll see that one of them is a ‘reading’ via Skype. (In keeping with the non-commercial spirit I’ve described, rather than ask for the reading for yourself, I'd rather you give it to a friend. And on this point, full disclosure: I have been given money for doing readings at an event, but the payment was from the organizer, so that none of the people who got readings had to pay for them; I’ve done readings for charity, so while the people being ‘read’ had to pay, they didn’t pay me; and recently I have had a few people voluntarily chip in to subsidize a beer or a coffee at a local cafe in exchange for readings, but I wouldn't want to make it a habit...)What's this campaign about?I like this work so much that I want to share it with as many people as possible, and I decided the best way to do this (beyond simply performing “readings” myself) would be through an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign that will allow me to print and distribute a limited edition of 60 “decks” of “Art Fortunes” for other people to use.I can think of three reasons why you might want to support this project: 1. You get to enjoy the artwork on your very own deck of Art Fortunes; 2. You can use the deck of “collage cards” to “tell fortunes” and connect with other people; and 3. You’ll be helping me to share my work and support me in creating more of it.The 3 things you 'get' when you support this project:
To enjoy the artwork on your very own deck of Art Fortunes;A meaningful experience for you.

To connect with other people by ""telling fortunes"" using your deck of Art Fortunes;  A meaningful experience for you and for others.

3. To support me in creating and sharing my work;A meaningful experience for you and for me.

(For an artist who works pretty much outside the ""art world"" and ""gallery system"", knowing people appreciate your work and are willing to help you make more of it is incredibly meaningful.) Why a ""limited edition of 60""?
Having a limited edition of ""Art Fortunes"" digital images created by an HP-certified printer maintains the value of this art object while making it accessible to more people.
Printing multiples of the entire deck rather than just individual cards lets other people use ""Art Fortunes"" as a form of non-commercial interaction rather than just as an object to be looked at and enjoyed.
Limiting the edition to 60 maximizes my time and energy so that I can share this work with others and then move on to new (and hopefully just as interesting) projects.
So, Check out the Perks, and once again,Thank You For Your Consideration!Thanks to a previous Indiegogo campaign, I was able to complete another favorite project of mine, an installation that began life under the title ""Have Your Photograph Taken as an Ottoman Princess"" (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-ottoman-princess-and-her-sisters/x/11441102#/). I hope you'll consider funding ""Art Fortunes"" yourself and/or sharing this campaign with others. If you've got any questions, just drop me a line...",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">TEXTILE ARTS CENTER</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Textile Arts Center (TAC) is a NYC-based resource facility dedicated to raising awareness and understanding of textiles through creative educational programs for children and adults. We are thrilled to be hosting this workshop with Timeteo.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">At TAC, we aspire to unify the textile community and advocate for the handmade by providing accessible, skills-based classes that reinvigorate engagement with traditional crafts. Techniques like weaving, sewing, and dyeing are practical, connective, and process-driven -- common denominators for designers, artists, and creative practitioners around the world. Because these activities are so widely used, they help to foster community and bring creativity back into our daily lives. They are part of our collective history and vital to our ongoing expressions of design, art, and culture. Textile Arts Center aspires to unify and empower the textile community, and advocate for the handmade.</p>

Your impact
Support the power and niceness of handmade with natural materials as it has been done for millennia and their efforts to preserve and revitalize their textile traditions.  
New York will receive an ancestral knowledge and in exchange their community will develop their own entrepreneurship abilities and will open new collaborations with designers, artists, and creative practitioners.

Timothy Ccarita Sacaca is a master weaver, natural dyes researcher and a weaver trainer from the district of Pitumarca, Cusco, Peru.
For decades, Timoteo has formed groups of weavers in natural yarning, weaving and dyeing techniques. He has trained weavers in a mothers' club in Ccapacchapi. He has founded weavers' associations in several communities. In Pitumarca: Munaik Tiklla, Inka Pachacutec, Ñaupa Away Karwi Association, Uchu Llukllu, Wasa Pampa and Labraco. In Sant Pablo the association of Santa Barbara; And in Lares, Chokecancha. In these associations of weavers continues to participate teaching to spin, to weave and to dye.
Albert Gomà Sala, from Social innova, met Timoteo in 2014 introduced by Francesco, the son of Timoteo who is living in Italy. Afterwards, we decided to make a better promotion for their products together thanks to our friendship.
We need your support to  build a network of people who share common values on both sides of the World.Values of perseverance, sustainability, transparency, effort and humility, the same values that I was inspired and I've learned by timoteo and his community.
What We Need & What You Get
The workshop

Timoteo will run a workshop in the Textile Arts Center in Manhattan. 26 W. 8th Street New York, NY 10011.

You will discover that symbols and patterns in Andean textiles it's something more than a design, you will know their true significance and importance.
We will perform the Andean ritual “pago a la tierra”  (payment to the land), an offering to Pachamama or Mother Earth thanking for the product she has given us.
The last part of the workshop allows for collaborative design with Timoteo with the methodology of Social innova for co creation. Participants will have the chance of discussing and hands-on try the process of weaving and creating patterns.

The art pieces

All their works starts in hand-spinning natural fibers into yarn. “Spinning” is simply twisting fibers together so they make a strong, usable cord.

They dye the yarn with natural dyes. Cochinilla for pink, violet and red (Dactylopus coccus); Qolli for yellow and orangev (Buddleja coriacea); chillka for green (Baccharis latifolia) or indigo for blue (Indigofera).
Thanks to Timoteo and his community, rich, earthy reds, purples, greens and gold again suffuse the natural fibers spinned by hand. When you see their works, you are surrounded by colors reminiscent of hues achieved by the Inca and even older Peruvian civilizations.

They patiently weave in a waist loom.

The bong will be built in large sections and shipped to Las Vegas for assembly just in time for the Grand Opening of Cannabition on the July 1, 2017.An ode to all that is cannabis-relatedFrom commissioning Bongzilla to building out our space, Cannabition has been a serious undertaking, requiring lots of time, politicking with government officials, and more than $3 million dollars invested in to building an experience people around the world can immerse themselves in.How to stake your claim on a piece of cannabis historyThrough Cannabition, we are creating an experience that will transcend the way people experience the world of legal cannabis. Since this is such a unique, never-been-done-before project, we need the help from the global cannabis community to make our vision a reality.Spanning from simple weekly updates on construction progress and exclusive Cannabition merchandise to naming rights to the World's Largest Bong (!!) and a VIP trip to Vegas (flight included), you have a chance to be a part of something that will expand the world’s understanding of cannabis history, the art of glass blowing, and new cultural norms through experiences.Thanks for joining us on this ride - we're excited to have you!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Project: MythoFutuRiddim</h3>
<p>I'm A.C. Evans a Brooklyn based <a href=""http://acevansart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">curator, artist and designer</a>. MythoFutuRiddim is a self-funded pop-up exhibition featuring the work of a select group of emerging artists who explore ritual, cultural mythology, Afrofuturism and constructed identity.  The name, MythoFutuRiddim, evolves from the term Afrofuturism and is also a combination of Mythology, Futurism, and Riddim/music.  The exhibition creates a conceptual dialogue to explore the ways these ideas contribute to the creative process.<strong> </strong>With this exhibition and those that follow I'm hoping to help artists actively develop and maintain creative careers on their own terms. </p>
<p>This exhibition will be the first in series of self-funded exhibitions with a focus on connecting emerging/early-career artists and new collectors in hopes of creating long-standing sustainable relationships between artists and patrons.</p>
<p>Your patronage will make a direct and tangible impact on the careers of the artists involved. Our overall goal for this exhibition is to provide a platform for artists to discuss, exhibit, promote and potentially sell their work to individuals interested in developing the long-term growth of early-career artists.</p>

<h3><strong>Become an Art patron</strong></h3>
<p>We are aiming for an initial goal of $4,000, to cover the expenses of self-funding this pop-up exhibition, which will run from Friday July 13 until Sunday July 15 2018.</p>
<p>Here is a breakdown of our budget:</p>

<p>Donations will result in the direct patronage of some very talented emerging artists who are building the important groundwork for their careers.  We aim to create a community minded, all encompassing space where artists, collectors, and art lovers from all cultural and financial backgrounds can fellowship and build an atmosphere of support.</p>
<h3>The Venue</h3>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Saturday July 14 - Gallery Hours 12PM - 8 PM</strong></h3>
<p>9:30 AM - 12:30 PM - MythoFutuRiddim is for the Kids!</p>
<p>On Saturday morning from 9:30 AM - 12 PM,  the gallery will be made available to parents with children between the ages of 2yrs - 12yrs for a special children's tour and Design Gym.</p>
<p>Children will be given a curator led tour through the exhibition, followed by an activity time where children will be allowed to create, display and discuss their works of Art. Using examples from the exhibition, attention will be given to how Basic Elements of Design (Line, Shape, + Space) have been employed to create the work featured in the exhibition.</p>
<p>**Materials and Snacks will be provided**</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Sunday July 15 - Gallery Hours 12PM - 6 PM</strong></h3>
<p><strong>4 PM - 6PM - Artists Presentations + Discussion</strong></p>
<p>Participating artists will give ten-minute lightning talks about the foundational concepts of their art practice.  After the presentations, there will be an open public discussion around how the concepts of mythology, futurism, and riddim/music influence the making of art.</p>
<p><strong>6PM - Closing Ceremony</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Impact &amp; Traction</strong></h3>
<p>Your contribution to this project will make a direct impact on the lives of the artists involved.  By participating in helping us bring this concept to life, you are showing that there is demand for artist-created, patron-driven projects.  By becoming a patron, you are illustrating that there is a vibrant community wiling to help artists who want to build their careers on their own terms.  In the future, we hope to increase the length of shows, include more artists and offer more creative opportunities for artist patronage.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Personally, this project represents the manifestation of an idea I’ve long hand on how to create opportunities for artists to share their special gifts.  Furthermore, this project is so very important because it represents risk, fear, challenges and most importantly opportunity.  Risk is an important component of all our lives. If we don't risk change, we take the chance of never realizing the things we're meant to accomplish. This project also represents a direct challenge to fear, and a more direct confrontation to the idea that Art should only be produced and experienced by individuals with a certain level of ""knowledge"", ""education"" and/or financial means.</p>
<h3><strong>Donor Perks, Original Art and V.I.P’s</strong></h3>
<p>All donors at any level will have their name included in the <strong>Patrons of the Arts</strong> list which will be prominently posted at the exhibition.  Your name will also be included on the <a href=""https://myth.splashthat.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MythoFutuRiddim website</a> as a Patron of the Arts.</p>
<p>Along with the chance to make a quantifiable difference in the life of a living artist we’re also offering limited edition posters, screen-prints, and sticker-packs.  We are also offering a chance to acquire original works of art. If demand is strong and we’re able to surpass our goal we plan to offer a private V.I.P viewing for the exhibition on July 12, where each donor will be able to meet the participating artists and discuss direct patronage opportunities.</p>
<h3><strong>Money ain't everything</strong></h3>
<p>Last but definitely not least, currency or money is simply a tangible form of energy.  Your energy patronage of our project will be directly transformed into making more Art. Sometimes though, you just don't have it and we get that.  Never fear, you can still help immensely by:</p>

My name is Shauna (aka Cat), and I'm an Irish artist yearning to go home. Will you join me? YOU. ME. AND THE WEST-COAST OF IRELAND!Even though I currently live and create in the Austrian hills of the sound of music – in the company of my man, his mam, and our three cats - I cannot shake the feeling of ""homesickness"", whenever my gaze wanders across the landscape that surrounds me.It’s beautiful, but it doesn’t feel like home. The kind of home, where even the thought of litter on the street gives you a nostalgic pang…To me, Ireland is not only my ancestral home, but my emotional home as well. And I know that many of you feel the same way. As an Irish person gallivanting around Europe, I have come across two reactions to me being from Ireland:1)      OMG! I love Ireland and I can’t wait to get back there!2)      OMG! I’ve never been there, but I can’t wait to go there in the future!This proves to me that there is something about the Irish landscape, the people, the way of life, and the constant dampness [just kidding…sort of] that makes it a place many feel drawn to on a very emotional level.That’s why, with your support, I’ve decided to turn my month-long vacation in August into an artist residency. By doing that, I have the funds to not only explore the ruins and the cliffs of Kerry [and find the best bakery], but I can use all of my creative skills to share the experience with you and make you feel like you were there with me!WILL YOU SPEND ALL THE MONEY ON CAKE?First of all, no. But I know how scary it can feel to support a stranger on the internet, so let me tell you what your contribution will help me do:
Finance a share of the flight and accomodation costs
Allow me to pay for ferries, museums, and other cultural explorations that I want to share with you
Pay for a share of my material expenses
Pay for a share of the production costs of your perks
and, maybe, a slice of rhubarb crumble....ARE YOU EVEN ABLE TO PAINT?You're going to have to trust me on this one, but if you still feel like you want to make sure, you can have a look at some of my work here: http://www.catdepillar.com/artwork/And, in case you feel curious but also too lazy to check my website [I think we're soulmates], here are some examples of my work,and the type of abstract landscapes I do [this piece is done in watercolours on wood].WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME, YOU ASK?I know that you're not interested in financing my passion of finding and eating the best scones in Dingle....which is why I have a plan B that I think you might find a little more interesting!In exchange for your contribution to my artist residency, I offer many different perks that I think you might enjoy. And: If you can think of anything else you'd like, I am open to suggestions! [No, I'm not going to send you sausage-rolls Mam.....]5 € // A BIG Thank You + Access to My Secret BlogFor 5 € you are not only the recipient of the biggest virtual hug ever, but you also get access to my secret blog, where I document my artist residency and take you behind the scenes. 10 € // The Above + A Postcard Sent to You From Ireland  In addition to the 5 € perks, I will send you a postcard from Ireland via snail-mail!

<h2>Hey there! We are Cuddle or Die! </h2>
<p>A group of big-dream burners planning to bring a huge project out to the Black Rock desert. This is a camp born of the “if I want it, I should bring it” mentality that Burning Man thrives on. Over the last couple years the idea has grown and morphed into what is finally an achievable, yet still magnificent, theme camp that will enrich the burn for anyone who gets to play on our structures. There’s always ideas, especially out there, that are great and at their full extent would be incredible, but without the funding to achieve each goal the whole thing kinda falls flat. This could be one of those experiences. With your support, our three tall climbable structures, our fuzzy filled cuddle pit, and our 4500+ LEDs could easily be the best part of your burn, for the next several years (we have big expansion plans too!). But as our first year, we need your help to get it all started.</p>
<h3>How does your contribution make -your- burn better?</h3>
<p>At minimum we are aiming to cover three big expenses that are a bit more than we can bite off alone. The scaffolding to build the towers is amazingly expensive, and unsurprisingly quite heavy. This leads to a transportation issue. One of our biggest expenses that you can help with seems simple, getting it all out to the middle of nowhere. Next is power. Having over 4500 lights takes a hell of a lot more power than we have ever personally needed before, and generators are pricey. Especially the quiet ones that won’t annoy our neighbors all night so we can keep the lights on for you. This accounts for about ¾ of our goal.</p>
<p>The other quarter is to allow us to provide even more fun for you. Climbing scaffolding up to 13 feet is fun on it’s own, but what if you didn’t have to climb the actual scaffolding? What if you could climb a cargo net, or a rock wall, or show off your strength on a hanging rope, wouldn’t that be better? And instead of just a high energy playground, what if there were a couple hammocks lower in the front towers where you could rest in the shade without having to put much energy in? How about all those LEDs in the cuddle loft? Do you think it’d be more enjoyable with a layer of diffusing fabric to help cut down the harshness that LEDs can have? Have you ever wanted to try aerial silks? Or do want an aerial yoga class every morning throughout the week?  Did you answer yes to any of these questions? We did, too. That’s the other quarter of our goal. Enrichment. But how much we can provide all depends on you. In some ways this is a create-your-own adventure. How much fun do you want to have out there?</p>
<h3>But what could go wrong?</h3>
<p>With everything Burning Man, there are challenges. The environment, the wind, getting things out there, etc. But as mostly seasoned burners, none of these are new to us. We are working with a structural engineer and an architect to ensure some amount of safety in our structures. Sure safety third, but we want to ensure all the risks you are taking are ones you can control, not taking the risk that our towers might collapse at any given gust of wind.</p>
<p>While most of our members have been involved with theme camps in previous years, this is the first year that we’ve been responsible for running one, which is rather scary. It’s easy to dream big and not be realistic with what we can achieve out first year out, but with each step and idea we have we make three layers; minimum viable product, yeah that makes it cooler, and Holy shit that’d be awesome! Our internal funds can cover most of our minimal product, but who wants minimums at Burning Man? This is why we need your help. We don’t want to give you something half cocked.</p>
<h3>Hey, that looks great, but I'm poor... Sorry :/</h3>
<p>So maybe building your own infrastructure has taken every spare penny you have, we completely get that and don’t judge at all. We’ve got some members that need to make every cent count, too. There are other ways to help us though, if you are even half as excited about this idea as we are. Perhaps share this page with your burner family, there’s easy buttons above to help with that. Or perhaps you are a campless traveler and want somewhere to call home and you think our project is super rad and want to join us. Awesome! Send us an email about who you are. We still have a bit more space (placement was generous) to house a few adventurous cuddle-bugs.</p>
<p>No matter what you can do to help us, we are grateful for you positive energy and reading this far. We love you and please come get some cuddles during the week. Can’t wait to hug you!!</p>

<p>I'm an artist based in Stroud in the UK who makes sculpture, installation and performative work which looks at memory and imagination, the self and the 'other'. I make large scale rammed earth pieces and large performative, participatory drawings, but recently have started a new body of work looking at how close imagination and memory are. I've been working with anthropologist and artist Elizabeth Hodson from the 'Knowing from the Inside' anthropology project led by Tim Ingold in Aberdeen and want to continue my research into memory, imagination and language.</p>
<p>Here's an example of some of my larger rammed earth work:<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512131788/myxhtwayotlcvdbgnire.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>My new work has been influence by imaginings; miniature pen and ink drawings of imagined mountains and rock forms, small rammed earth mountain sculptures in unlikely places.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512126460/saqrtoosmo8osyft9yqn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And now I have the amazing opportunity to travel the long way to Hyrynsalmi in Finland, to the sub-arctic circle, to spend a month in the snow, dark and wildness of the Oulu region. Here I will be able to work intensively on this new body of work; read and develop my ongoing research discussion with Dr Elizabeth Hodson and develop new performative work based on darkness/light, imagined fears and storytelling. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512065497/sayd6f56w4dxilyzss9b.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This residency would give me time to reflect and work, to be immersed in an environment which would not only inspire new work but also which reflects my own making ethos. Mustarinda is an artist residency venue and ecological research centre (<a href=""http://www.mustarinda.fi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mustarinda.fi</a>), they support low-carbon travel and encourage all artists in residence to travel by land and sea rather than fly. Travel is vital for my work, but I won't compromise my own decision made over 10 years ago not to fly. My family have traveled to several European residencies by train and boat and we know that not only is this way of travelling much better for the environment it also gives us a much deeper cultural understanding of the countries through which we travel. Moreover the work will start on the journey, with the collection of stories and interactions with people we meet along the way.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509920610/rcrslokxk6dvutz8nsxv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It's a long way... (map shows car route, we'll be traveling a similar route by train and ferry). </p>
<p>My husband Ed and son Ru (6) are coming too... they will be informing the work I make and collaborating (when they're not doing their own work). They have come with me to residencies in the UK and Germany, they feed my creative practice and will, at Mustarinda, participate in the making process by sharing stories and fears. Ru is home-educated so travelling to Finland will be a massive learning experience for him and will feed his already busy imagination and contribute to his education. Here he is on the train back from Greece, busy writing and drawing in his travel journal.</p>

<p>So why fund this project? Any contribution you can make would enable us not only to get there in the first place but allow much more work to be made once there. And this work and research will be brought back and shown publically. Once I'm back in the UK I will have an exhibition of work made and present a talk about both the residency and the philosophy and anthropology research I'm involved in. This is not just a personal interest, the subjects and areas I'm researching are relevant to all (socially and politically), and there have been large audiences at previous talks and events I've organised so i know there are many eager for the chance to see and discuss more.</p>
<p>This project comes at a critical time in my practice, when a long body of work (over 10 years) is shifting and finding a new focus. The research I am continuing explores complex and fundamental questions of self and other-ness, something increasingly important to look at in relation to movement of people, freedom and understanding between different cultures.  I hope that in a very small way some of my work triggers some important discussions, not always comfortable for the viewer or the participant.</p>
<p>But all of this work costs money! If you can donate a little you will be helping to fund not only the travel to Finland but materials, postage, other production costs and exhibition costs once back in the UK.</p>
<p>The chance to work uninterrupted is priceless for any artist, but you can benefit from this period of work by receiving perks of limited edition prints, limited edition books and original new works which have not yet been publically shown!</p>
</div><div>
<p>The funding I'm  looking for is £1000. It will go towards our travel (by train and ferry... it's a three day journey via Hamburg, Stockholm, Helsinki then on up through Finland) and living costs in Finland, but also towards materials like paper and inks, plaster and clay for making moulds etc. I will also need to send work back at the end of the residency so this is an additional cost.</p>
<p>The perks for you will range from a set of postcards of new works, to limited edition signed prints to original sculptures and drawings. I want you to receive something really special as a personal thank you!</p>
<p>Here are just some of the perks you could receive as a thank you for your support:</p>

<p>If I don't reach the full goal the money will simply go towards the costs of the residency, so every little bit of funding is really very appreciated. </p>
<p>Previous residencies have provided invaluable time and focus for developing work. I'm not only an artist. I am a teacher and a mother. These other 'jobs' not only feed into but also draw upon my time for making work, so dedicated time for my practice is vital.

</div><div>Any creative adventure like this is a challenge, but I feel like I am open to experience and to allow experience to shape the work made.

I make large scale rammed earth pieces and large performative, participatory drawings, but recently have started a new body of work looking at how close imagination and memory are. I've been working with anthropologist and artist Elizabeth Hodson from the 'Knowing from the Inside' anthropology project led by Tim Ingold in Aberdeen and want to continue my research into memory, imagination and language.
Here's an example of some of my larger rammed earth work:
My new work has been influence by imaginings; miniature pen and ink drawings of imagined mountains and rock forms, small rammed earth mountain sculptures in unlikely places.

And now I have the amazing opportunity to travel the long way to Hyrynsalmi in Finland, to the sub-arctic circle, to spend a month in the snow, dark and wildness of the Oulu region. Here I will be able to work intensively on this new body of work; read and develop my ongoing research discussion with Dr Elizabeth Hodson and develop new performative work based on darkness/light, imagined fears and storytelling. 

This residency would give me time to reflect and work, to be immersed in an environment which would not only inspire new work but also which reflects my own making ethos. Mustarinda is an artist residency venue and ecological research centre (www.mustarinda.fi), they support low-carbon travel and encourage all artists in residence to travel by land and sea rather than fly. Travel is vital for my work, but I won't compromise my own decision made over 10 years ago not to fly. My family have traveled to several European residencies by train and boat and we know that not only is this way of travelling much better for the environment it also gives us a much deeper cultural understanding of the countries through which we travel. Moreover the work will start on the journey, with the collection of stories and interactions with people we meet along the way.

It's a long way... (map shows car route, we'll be traveling a similar route by train and ferry). 
My husband Ed and son Ru (6) are coming too... they will be informing the work I make and collaborating (when they're not doing their own work). They have come with me to residencies in the UK and Germany, they feed my creative practice and will, at Mustarinda, participate in the making process by sharing stories and fears. Ru is home-educated so travelling to Finland will be a massive learning experience for him and will feed his already busy imagination and contribute to his education. Here he is on the train back from Greece, busy writing and drawing in his travel journal.

So why fund this project? Any contribution you can make would enable us not only to get there in the first place but allow much more work to be made once there. And this work and research will be brought back and shown publically. Once I'm back in the UK I will have an exhibition of work made and present a talk about both the residency and the philosophy and anthropology research I'm involved in. This is not just a personal interest, the subjects and areas I'm researching are relevant to all (socially and politically), and there have been large audiences at previous talks and events I've organised so i know there are many eager for the chance to see and discuss more.

<p>Dearest friends and art lovers,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks to so many of you for your support of my first book, “The Art of ABC” (<a href=""http://www.tashasbamboobrush.com/bamboobrush/book.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.tashasbamboobrush.com/bamboobrush/book.html</a>).  I'm writing to ask for your support on my new project, “The Art of 1, 2, 3...” which will utilize my Chinese brush paintings as counting tools for all ages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have decided to take a different approach to publishing the new book which will cost as much as $2500 from start to finish. My goal is to publish in the next few months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, I just launched a campaign on the crowd-funding platform Indiegogo to help defray the cost, and I'm hoping you'll be willing to pitch in. In return, you'll receive a signed book from me as a token of my gratitude. You can donate anywhere from $25 to whatever you are comfortable with--every little bit counts!  And, as you know, these book make great gifts for new families (for every $25 contribution you receive a book).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All of the money raised will go directly towards the cost of publishing.  Any extra will be used for the third book -- which is in the planning stages. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your support means so much. Whether or not you're able to support me monetarily, you can also help by sharing my campaign through social media and word of mouth--please direct people to the aforementioned link. Many thanks!</p>

I've created pieces that have been purchase by Greenpeace to be used as examples of how to transform trash into art. My art has been featured at galleries in Mexico and even Art Basel in Miami. Art has always been my passion and I have also worked as a film maker. I wrote and directed  a short film featured in 26 international film festivals, including Cannes. Some friends of mine asked me to use the skills and trinkets I've collected over the last 20 years to create piece of art for them to wear to Burning Man and I found a new passion! This is a piece of art done with electronic trash, bought by Greenpeace. It´s done with Iphones, cables, and the eyes of the skull are little cameras also from destroyed mobiles. I'm growing and adapting the skills I've learned from my other art pieces and the same collection I've been growing for 20 years. I started with a pair of sunglasses, then a hat, then three and I'm not slowing down. The more I read about Burning Man, the more I know my art belongs there - with you! Each trinket has the energy and history of the owner and the place were it came from. When put together in a certain way they can tell a story, a story I want to share with you. My goal is to go to Burning Man and deliver your perks to you on the playa. I´ll share  the story of the piece of art and the origin and history of the individual trinkets you are getting. Each one is unique and completely unrepeatable, composed of trinkets collected over the last 20 years. The CUSTOM perks include video chatting with me, exploring my collection virtually and designing a completely custom piece. The ARTIST'S CHOICE perks will be created by me with some very basic input from you (size, type, etc).

 ABOUT THE SHOW 

 
Kulovalkea is an old-fashioned Finnish word meaning a rapidly expanding wildfire, a metaphor to witness something visually beautiful and an opportunity to plant new trees. The show will be a multidisciplinary contemporary circus performance with 8 artists on stage. It will hour and 15 minutes long. We have scenes built around tight wire, gymnastic balls, skipping ropes, dance triple trapeze, aerial rope, juggling, contorsion and acrobatics.   Our starting point was to find something descriptive on all the circus disciplines that would connect them to every day moments and every day life. We wanted the circus to tell something by itself.  
The finished show will be a collection of fragmentes scenes that come together as a full experience. Through collaboration and confrontation, seemingly ordinary things turn into something unexpected and twisted. We seek a feeling that gets you carried away with the rhythm of detailed actions that are absurd and fun to experience, like an uncontrolled stream of conciousness. A very detailed, well rhythmic and disorienting experience of motion and mood.
  EXISTING SUPPORT

 ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
Origins and artistic process
 
Rather than focusing on technical virtuosity, the performance uses circus technics and equipment developed in a movement research to create tools of expressions as a language of it’s own. Various kinds of acrobatics, object manipulation and contemporary dance skills are used to create a world with its own non-sensical logic where things seem to work on their own, playful yet serious ways.

 
The audience is invited to take a closer look to the actions and details by technically bringing forward the sound, the breath and the pressure in the body during the intense movements. This brings forth the realism of the technical virtuosity of circus skills and enhances the genuine first-hand experience. The performance leaves a space for the audience’s imagination and everyone experiences the show in a different way.
 

Together these elements create a fragmentary contemporary circus experience that is played with a nonchalant presence. With minimalist aesthetics and carefully chosen focuses these elements create a performance with imaginative sceneries that turn into a colorful trip that is fun, virtuous and out of this world.

<h3>Our Plea</h3>
<p>COVID-19 almost brought Charm City to its knees, wiping out a vibrant nightlife and diverse food culture from Fell's Point to Hampden. <a href=""https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2020/07/08/gypsys-truckstaurant-missing-cat-fattycakes-latest/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amid this pandemic, our beloved cat, Fattycakes, was stolen! </a></p>
<p>The Queen only wants to feed the city she loves alongside the cat she loves. Baltimore deserves global street food in an eclectic atmosphere, so we're using Indiegogo to make the world aware of his catnapping. Think of this Indiegogo project as your virtual Truckstaurant without Fattycakes. </p>
<p>Our fun way of keeping Gypsy's Truckstaurant alive until we find our cat and can celebrate in person again with the best city in the world!</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Our Plea
COVID-19 almost brought Charm City to its knees, wiping out a vibrant nightlife and diverse food culture from Fell's Point to Hampden. Amid this pandemic, our beloved cat, Fattycakes, was stolen! 
The Queen only wants to feed the city she loves alongside the cat she loves. Baltimore deserves global street food in an eclectic atmosphere, so we're using Indiegogo to make the world aware of his catnapping. Think of this Indiegogo project as your virtual Truckstaurant without Fattycakes. 
Our fun way of keeping Gypsy's Truckstaurant alive until we find our cat and can celebrate in person again with the best city in the world!
 


 
What We Need & What You Get
We're going to have a bunch of unique designs of Fattycakes available to our backers. We will have everything from limited edition t-shirts, and more exciting limited edition merch as our campaign progresses:

We're hoping to raise $7,500 by highlighting awareness of Fatty's abduction through fabulous designs including t-shirts and stickers featuring Fattycakes in every design until he is returned!

<h3>Becoming Unfinished</h3>
<p>I am an artist and a learning &amp; development specialist--with this performance installation I will combine my two passions and hope to nudge the world toward change.  Essentially I will create a gallery installation inside a theater with twice daily performances, November 20-24.  People can visit during gallery hours and use the theater to connect with the art and the space, and at 1PM and 7PM (the latter followed by a Q&amp;A), they can see a 1 hour performance about father/son relationships, the continuity of human creation, and a comment on the current limitations of the human spirit.  When I'm not performing on stage, I will sit in the audience, watching the visitors look at the art, thus reversing the roles. </p>
<p><strong>My goal for this appeal is to cover the expenses of the space and production so that this exhibition is open and free to the public. </strong></p>
<p>For a very long time I've wanted to create a performance inside an art installation.  Soon after my father's recent death I saw a production of Our Town and became inspired by both events.  This exhibition will be a dedication to my father, to Thornton Wilder, and to the potential of the human race. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Leading up to the exhibition I will offer gallery tours to the surrounding community.  Each week I will curate a new selection of Chelsea galleries to visit and after we discuss what was seen, hopefully leading people to come up with their own insights.  It is my hope that the community be inspired to continue to use the galleries that surround it.  Although the galleries can be seen as elitist and are designed to be intimidating, they are a great free resource for inspiration, learning, and development.  Art has become this seemingly precious commodity.  But I think art can be as relevant as it once was when we were just starting out as a species.  The original art, cave drawings and carved images, were pure magic.  They inspired us to stay alive.   My hope is that art becomes as relevant now as it was then, not just a money making machine. </p>
<p>These tours will then lead up to my own exhibition where I want to push people to move past their DNA, which has gotten our species this far, but how can we now pull together, cross tribal lines and move forward as a species.  How can we rise above what we were taught in school and by our parents, and our friends, our history and our stories, to come together  and create art that moves us forward?  To get beyond our past we have to share it--this is also one of the goals of this exhibition.  I want to inspire people to share their struggles, their pain, their calling, their victories.  We have to come out of our own closets, whatever those may be to us, be vulnerable and connect to the person down the street and across the world.</p>

We will also start an online shop in 2022, please stay tuned.   If you have contributed, no worry we will make sure you will get the perks.  The Story behind DrainArtDrainArt: enamel pins is a passion project by us. We are Mary and Philip, a couple living in Hong Kong and we love traveling to Japan. We love Japanese aesthetics. You can find surprises in every street corner. Fascinated by the beautiful manhole cover designs there, we think turning them into something wearable and collectible is a great idea.  So we have selected 16 designs that we like best (with the generous help from our social media followers, thank you all!). We will turn them into enamel pins you can wear. We have also designed a wall scroll in the style of Ukiyo-e print to display all the pins on the wall.Design Overview All 16 pins will be 2 inches (5.08cm) in diameter, just big enough to recreate all the intricate details on the manhole covers. They are all soft enamel pins, the bases are finished with antique silver plating or black nickel plating. There will be two rubber clutches at the back on each pin.A wall scroll to display all your pins.A wall scroll in the style of Ukiyo-e print showcases the locations of the covers. The size is approximately 34x 82cm (13.4 x 32 inches) . It is a nice way to hang all the pins on the wall. It is a great decoration piece for your home. It will be printed on a high quality sturdy textured paper with a fine printing surface. A hand-drawn map of Japan indicates where the manholes are located Add-on mini pinsTo make things more exciting, we have turned 6 of the pins into mini ones you can add-on to your perks. They are adorable and is perfect to carry around.

<h3></h3>
<p>I have been working as a teacher in Baltimore City Schools for 15 years. At the same time, I have been an artist exploring spaces, objects and collections through photography. Starting in January of 2015, I was able to bring together my two worlds (<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">urban education and fine art photography) through an iPhone photo project I originally shot and shared with friends via Facebook on a day-to-day basis. I began working on what was originally called the Stairwell Project when I was assigned to spend part of each school day patrolling a stairwell to ensure students were going to classes.  This allocation of my work time led me to reflect on the idea of ""work,"" how spaces are used and time is parceled out in the context of the school building in a school system that, both physically and metaphorically, is crumbling around us and is in need of so much work. </span></p>
<h3></h3>
<p>I began to collect images of the interesting and meaningful objects and spaces I encountered during each class period I spent on stairwell duty, and then extended that idea to also collect images on days when I was not stationed on the stairwell because I was covering classes for teachers who were absent when we could not secure a substitute or proctoring required state testing. While these images speak to the specific activities that occupy much of teachers' and administrators' time during the school day, they also point clearly to the work that remains for all of us who are invested in our public education system.  They are beautiful in composition and color but often disheartening in content: leaky windows, cracked concrete, litter, multiple layers of peeling paint, etc. These images point out the beauty in our crumbling system as well as the work that lies ahead. </p>
<p><i>Side note: Please be sure to watch the video above in HD in order to get a full understanding of the impact of the imagery!</i></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px;"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>
<p>I am posting this project to raise enough funds to print a limited edition of 40 selected images from the Stairwell Project series. I want to put on an exhibition that showcases these images in hopes of sharing my experiences in Baltimore City Schools and helping our community better understand some of the challenges that our schools (and by extension our students and teac<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">hers) face.

<ul> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This project is the culmination of eight months of focused work taking and editing hundreds of photographs that might provide a window into the challenges Baltimore's students and teachers face because of weaknesses and blatant failings in our school system's infrastructure. The exhibition that will result from this fundraising effort will help bring the weaknesses in Baltimore City Schools' infrastructure in front of a larger audience of community members with the social and financial capital to push for real changes in the systems that are failing our community. The images in this project specifically focus on the spaces and objects that impact schooling and, in doing so, document empirical facts about the state of our school buildings and the learning environments we provide for the young people who will lead our city and our world. This project will push the larger Baltimore community to look closely at how we are failing our children, bringing issues of educational equity to the forefront.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
</div>While I don't anticipate any major challenges in completing my project once funding is secured (as the funding for the project IS the major challenge I've faced), I know I will come upon small obstacles along the way to project fulfillment. I will need to secure a space for my exhibition, ensure the images I am working with are printed correctly and in a timely manner, and work with a variety of businesses to finalize the items I am offering for rewards as well as the space for the exhibition itself. Anyone who knows me knows that I am not a quitter, and I have a vast network of contacts to help me in making this project a success. If 15 years of ongoing work in Baltimore City Schools doesn't point to my ability to persevere in the face of challenges, I don't know what does. I have no doubts regarding my ability to make this project a reality and a success.<div>
<br/><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Please help support my campaign by sharing it as widely as possible. It's as simple as that. Getting the word out goes a long way toward making this project a reality. Thank you!</p>

Here is a detailed budget breakdown based on the full amount I am hoping to raise so you can see where the money will go. If the full amount is not reached, I will scale the project back accordingly by printing a smaller edition of prints if necessary. 


Printing costs for a limited edition of 10 prints each for 40 images (as quoted for archival quality printing on smooth fine art paper from a local printer): $2880
Printing and postage costs for thank-you postcards given as rewards (based on cost of $.50 per postcard, offering unlimited number but figuring based on 50 backers at this level): $25
Printing costs for unframed square prints given as rewards (based on cost of $1 per 4""x4"" print, offering 340 square prints as rewards): $340
Printing costs for framed square prints given as rewards (based on cost of $35 per framed 4""x4"" print, with finished size of 8""x8"", offering 30 framed prints as rewards): $1050
Estimated shipping costs and shipping materials: $300
Estimated 10% Indiegogo fee: $460
Estimated total project cost: $5055


Please help me share these images and make them available to you and others.  Please share this project with your friends! Thank you so much for your support. 

 
  The Impact This project is the culmination of eight months of focused work taking and editing hundreds of photographs that might provide a window into the challenges Baltimore's students and teachers face because of weaknesses and blatant failings in our school system's infrastructure. The exhibition that will result from this fundraising effort will help bring the weaknesses in Baltimore City Schools' infrastructure in front of a larger audience of community members with the social and financial capital to push for real changes in the systems that are failing our community. The images in this project specifically focus on the spaces and objects that impact schooling and, in doing so, document empirical facts about the state of our school buildings and the learning environments we provide for the young people who will lead our city and our world. This project will push the larger Baltimore community to look closely at how we are failing our children, bringing issues of educational equity to the forefront.
 
  Risks & Challenges  
While I don't anticipate any major challenges in completing my project once funding is secured (as the funding for the project IS the major challenge I've faced), I know I will come upon small obstacles along the way to project fulfillment. I will need to secure a space for my exhibition, ensure the images I am working with are printed correctly and in a timely manner, and work with a variety of businesses to finalize the items I am offering for rewards as well as the space for the exhibition itself. Anyone who knows me knows that I am not a quitter, and I have a vast network of contacts to help me in making this project a success. If 15 years of ongoing work in Baltimore City Schools doesn't point to my ability to persevere in the face of challenges, I don't know what does. I have no doubts regarding my ability to make this project a reality and a success.

Other Ways You Can Help Please help support my campaign by sharing it as widely as possible. It's as simple as that. Getting the word out goes a long way toward making this project a reality. Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","AN ARTIST LIVING IN LOS ANGELES NEEDS YOUR HELP TO KEEP HIS WORKSHOP. BASED IN K-TOWN WITH NON-STOP MENTAL STATE. 
KEEP ART ALIVE!!!
A small donation goes a long way and your donation can help a struggling artist stay in his workshop and keep working on new ideas.


 MONEY!  |  STRESS!  |  COLLECTIONS!  |  Top Ramen? | PROBLEMS. 
                                                                       
// As artist's sometimes we take chances. // I know first hand that life can be a risky tumbleweed of scares from a chance that we sometime's take. Well I have to admit, I'm not comfortable about the idea of life being scary at all! Personally as an artist, I struggle with the idea of taking chances in the first place. The biggest chance is job security. Do you risk it? Do you simply avoid the weeds of the financial tumble all together and stay complacent at a job that cares nothing about me and the craft that I produce? Or... take a leap of faith? and go Freelance? Risking the possibility of going down that long, dusty road called financial hardship.             My art is always for sale, even if I have to sell it on the streets. 

Broke, Tired, and with no where to go. Having nothing you're craft by your side. The one thing you know is right and you've spend hours, day in and day out, trying to perfect. Only to find loose bits of work here and there from websites that allow these one off clients types that require URGENT! turnaround and compensate with mediocre pay? I'm fine with hustling for work, but the problem ends up that you produce great work, in their demanding urgent! turnaround time, and in return get the runaround for months on payment. You Place endless amount of calls, border line harassing them for what little dollar it was you contracted for in the first place. Only to be left with tumbleweeds. Throwing off your financial flow (what little there is left), picking up a dust wind tornado and pushing you further down that dusty road, consuming you with stress, hemorrhoids and buttful of MONEY! STRESS! COLLECTIONS! Top Ramen? PROBLEMS. I kinda like Top Ramen and I refuse to be JUST ANOTHER NAME to an employer. I know I am better that. 


         A small collection of what I've had to offer in the past. (all SOLD)There is an invisible line that everyone stands in waiting for that ""Dream Job"" to come around. I believe we must make our dream job.  I live my dream job. I'm a hard worker and I know my worth. I refuse to let some temporary job attempt to evaluate that worth for me. Corporations in the work force are plain and simply not for me. As you can see I am not looking to hit some huge ""Jackpot"" with this campaign. Just some extra funds to help me get back on my feet for the month while I gain more client contracts and manage to get the never ending struggle back to somewhat of a better place.  It's the first of the rent guys and the money is just not here to water my weeds. They are getting dry and  starting to tumble. I have been struggling lately balancing bills to sales and I am looking for a simple trade off. You can rest assured your donations are going to a good cause ... Money for art. I'll make u a custom piece of art depending on your donation. Also, You'll feel happy knowing that you are helping a real artist pave the way in his career. EVERY DONATION GET'S A PERSONAL ""THANK YOU!"" AND ANY DONATION OVER $5 GET'S A CUSTOM PIECE OF ART FOR YOU TO KEEP. 

   


   

        A couple more pieces of what I've had to offer in the past. (all SOLD)
ABOUT ME: I don't drink or do drugs. I've attached a couple images of my studio below so you can see where i work out of and that I aint' no bum. The video at the top of the campaign show's a little bit more about who I am. 
   
   A look into my small but functional studio, where all the magic happens.

As an Art Director I'm available to hire for any creative freelance work you might have as well. Please visit my website by clicking here to see how I can help you or your business grow. Like I said I'm not looking for a hand-out merely a hand-off and I truly respect the value of a dollar and hard it is to part with sometimes. You should know that your donation WILL NOT be used for anything besides living costs, supplies, and needs of everyday living.
""Thanks again for helping out a real struggling artist avoid the tumbleweeds of everyday life!"" -Curtis David

<h3>YAY! We secured funding!</h3>
<div>Update!</div>
<div>We secured an investor who is providing us with enough to guarantee expansion. However, we can still use all the help we can get as we are working w a tiny budget! Funding is a loan, so we also need t repay it. Any money raised now is going directly to stock - we are buying from many small businesses and artists. We are also creating jobs in the community for women and anything we raise will go to the first little bit of paying those we will employ!</div>

<div><b>My Story:</b></div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<div>Papercakes pretty has been a seven year evolution of a dream I've had a for a very long time, pretty much since jr highschool. I started by making Paper crafts (that's where the name came from) and blogging. When I first started, I was a stay at home mom. I went through a really tough, messy split, and was left alone in a province w no family, no job, no income.. etc. I kept at papercakes, selling jewelry and doing photography and makeup, basically anything creative that I could make some money at. I continued to develop my online presence via social media. My life was beyond falling apart but I just kept pushing, and never stopped with papercakes. There were some very rough years, like almost homeless and a couple months without my kids years, and even an assault charge/weekend in jail for punching my ex husband. But I got through all that and came out the other side of it all stronger than I ever thought I could be. However, I still continue to struggle and hustle as a single mom running a business. We are doing amazing already, but I need to be making more to survive. I have a very solid plan to expand and solve that problem, but we can't get anywhere without money.</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1290999/files/20150312165719-1010078_10154114475910386_8994473702532076903_n.jpg?1426204639"" src="""" style=""width: 463px; height: 463px;""/></p></div>
<div>In August 2012, frustrated with my inability to find a job and refusing to sell my soul and work fast food and just barely survive, I tattooed my knuckles with the phrase ""moonbeam"". Seems counterproductive... it was... on purpose. I look at my hands constantly all day. This was my way of forever dedicating myself to this work, removing myself from those job prospects. People thought I was crazy. People always think I am crazy! haha... anyways by early 2013 I was taking a nail course and by summer of 2013 I was working full time doing nails. I had gone to makeup school at age 18 and I have worked for most major cosmetic lines out there so this transition went pretty naturally. I started in a small office and then in fall of 2013 I moved into our current location and started the boutique. We are currently about to launch online in a huge way with a new blog, website, and online store. Our online store will be the first of it's kind in canada and provide a way for people to order cool shit (PLUS SIZES, a big selection!!!!!!!!!!) from within their country and not pay duty. We aim to be a large scale online retailer that would be somewhat a combo of something like modcloth and forever 21.</div>

<br/>
</div>
<div>I am in a unique position with my business. I am extremely well branded, and well known. I have marketed myself so well via social media the last 6 years that I have become somewhat of a local celebrity and almost a caricature of myself  (cheesy I know, and it isn't hard in PEI lol) and am well known online. I have 35.000 followers on twitter as Papercakes and almost 15,000 ppl on FB between my personal account and business pages. </div>

<div>My network of people is loyal, and genuinely interested. I go far and beyond the typical social media marketing. I am my product. I allow customers and the online community complete access to my life, and i interact. I tweet 24/7 and have basically no filter. I am highly entertaining and I am good at drawing a crowd, as I am ridiculous and somewhat hard to ignore. I have soooo many rad people in my corner - just no banks! hahaha :) </div>

<div>We desperately need more space for the shop - we want to double the size locally. We are also expanding online in a major way right now. The other side of the building is perfectly set up to house a full salon with multiple estheticians and maybe a hair dresser, with the back being warehouse space. We can easily knock out a wall and have the whole bottom floor of the building. My business partner and I also live above the shop in an apartment so we are right on site.

We secured an investor who is providing us with enough to guarantee expansion. However, we can still use all the help we can get as we are working w a tiny budget! Funding is a loan, so we also need t repay it. Any money raised now is going directly to stock - we are buying from many small businesses and artists. We are also creating jobs in the community for women and anything we raise will go to the first little bit of paying those we will employ!

My Story:


Papercakes pretty has been a seven year evolution of a dream I've had a for a very long time, pretty much since jr highschool. I started by making Paper crafts (that's where the name came from) and blogging. When I first started, I was a stay at home mom. I went through a really tough, messy split, and was left alone in a province w no family, no job, no income.. etc. I kept at papercakes, selling jewelry and doing photography and makeup, basically anything creative that I could make some money at. I continued to develop my online presence via social media. My life was beyond falling apart but I just kept pushing, and never stopped with papercakes. There were some very rough years, like almost homeless and a couple months without my kids years, and even an assault charge/weekend in jail for punching my ex husband. But I got through all that and came out the other side of it all stronger than I ever thought I could be. However, I still continue to struggle and hustle as a single mom running a business. We are doing amazing already, but I need to be making more to survive. I have a very solid plan to expand and solve that problem, but we can't get anywhere without money.

In August 2012, frustrated with my inability to find a job and refusing to sell my soul and work fast food and just barely survive, I tattooed my knuckles with the phrase ""moonbeam"". Seems counterproductive... it was... on purpose. I look at my hands constantly all day. This was my way of forever dedicating myself to this work, removing myself from those job prospects. People thought I was crazy. People always think I am crazy! haha... anyways by early 2013 I was taking a nail course and by summer of 2013 I was working full time doing nails. I had gone to makeup school at age 18 and I have worked for most major cosmetic lines out there so this transition went pretty naturally. I started in a small office and then in fall of 2013 I moved into our current location and started the boutique. We are currently about to launch online in a huge way with a new blog, website, and online store. Our online store will be the first of it's kind in canada and provide a way for people to order cool shit (PLUS SIZES, a big selection!!!!!!!!!!) from within their country and not pay duty. We aim to be a large scale online retailer that would be somewhat a combo of something like modcloth and forever 21.




I am in a unique position with my business. I am extremely well branded, and well known. I have marketed myself so well via social media the last 6 years that I have become somewhat of a local celebrity and almost a caricature of myself  (cheesy I know, and it isn't hard in PEI lol) and am well known online. I have 35.000 followers on twitter as Papercakes and almost 15,000 ppl on FB between my personal account and business pages. 




My network of people is loyal, and genuinely interested. I go far and beyond the typical social media marketing. I am my product. I allow customers and the online community complete access to my life, and i interact. I tweet 24/7 and have basically no filter. I am highly entertaining and I am good at drawing a crowd, as I am ridiculous and somewhat hard to ignore. I have soooo many rad people in my corner - just no banks! hahaha :) 







I have shitty credit due to my marriage splitting up, so everything has been done on cash, and not a lot. I have worked my ASS off for the last two years and the shop is now a huge community! I have tons of nail clients and I brought on a partner to help me run the shop. We support local and we consign used clothing. We are huge into providing income for fellow artists and recycling. 


We desperately need more space for the shop - we want to double the size locally. We are also expanding online in a major way right now. The other side of the building is perfectly set up to house a full salon with multiple estheticians and maybe a hair dresser, with the back being warehouse space. We can easily knock out a wall and have the whole bottom floor of the building. My business partner and I also live above the shop in an apartment so we are right on site. The other space comes available for May of this year. 
  
This is my current working space. It's amazing, but it would be so nice to be able to have a few more girls in, doing not just nails but waxing and facials and pedis etc. We have the clientele for sure! 
 
   


The Impact
  The local economy here in PEI is pretty tough to say the least! We will be providing much needed jobs for women here and putting back into the economy. 
We will be buying wholesale directly from atisians Anyone who has watched my journey over the last seven years knows that I have put my heart and soul into this, and I will never give up.  We have real connection with our customers and clients. Not just locally, but all over the world. That is what has made me so successful on social media. Our supporters have been invested in following us now for many years and feel like they ""know"" me. They get to participate in this every step of the way.  

           


   Risks & Challenges 
PEI is an extremely interesting market. It is very hard for new business here, let alone ""different"" business and especially one run by a woman and a ""come from away"" (I am originally from Alberta) person - but I have developed such solid networking here and genuine relationships. So much so that when I almost had to close down last month due to the bad weather, those around me were scrambling to do all they could to help. We have a network that many businesses would KILL for - we just have no extra cash flow.

 art is about manifesting your mark on the world, whether others like it
 or not."" -David Brafman<br/><br/>There are many graffiti books and photographers dedicated to documenting graffiti walls and tags because they are by their very nature temporary. To my limited knowledge, no one outside of the graffiti crew members themselves has documented the internal culture of crews, as well as their impact on each other and the art world. <br/><br/>My interest in graffiti stemmed from a one time collaborative project funded by Ed and Brandy Sweeney and compiled through the J. Paul Getty Trust called: <a href=""http://blogs.getty.edu/iris/getty-voices-graffiti-black-book/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LA Liber Amicorum, which literally translates to “LA Book of Friends” </a>Graffiti artists use black art books to tag and network within and through various crews. This Liber Amicorum is popularly known as the Getty Graffiti Black Book. There was also an accompanying 2014 exhibit at <a href=""http://esmoa.org/experience/experience-11-scratch-june-8-until-september-21-2014/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ESMOA: Scratch.</a><br/><br/>Several members of the JOR and MTA crews that I have met were artists featured in the LA Liber Amicorum such as <a href=""http://www.getty.edu/research/zoom/GRIZoom?id=137#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EDER</a>, <a href=""http://www.getty.edu/research/zoom/GRIZoom?id=113#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BLOSM</a> and <a href=""http://www.getty.edu/research/zoom/GRIZoom?id=148#"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GASOLINE</a>. You can page through the whole book <a href=""http://www.getty.edu/research/special_collections/notable/la_liber_amicorum/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here.</a> <br/><br/>I could not believe my luck when I met the crew members themselves and they were so friendly and willing to answer my many questions. Over time they began to trust that I would capture their group with integrity and authenticity, while at the same time maintaining the anonymity of the members who do not wish to be known publicly. What I have seen and hope that I capture is the culture, camaraderie, and support for the creative endeavors of longtime friends and newcomers alike who crave artistic expression.<br/><br/>You can view some of the work from the last several months that I have featured on my photographer alter ego, AINE’s web journal:<br/><a href=""http://www.aineashford.com/grace-and-graffiti/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.aineashford.com/grace-and-graffiti/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Grace and Graffiti: Images from JS_JOR's 25th Reunion</a><br/><a href=""http://www.aineashford.com/a-d-museum-opening-jor-style/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A+D Museum Opening Gala: JOR members painted a mural</a><br/><a href=""http://www.aineashford.com/beyond-graffiti-2-part-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A+D Museum's Beyond Graffiti exhibit closing night</a><br/><a href=""http://www.aineashford.com/beyond-graffiti-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A+D Museum's Beyond Graffiti exhibit wall painting and How I Met the Crew</a><br/><br/><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b><br/>I know not everyone can contribute monetarily.

 art is about manifesting your mark on the world, whether others like it
 or not."" -David BrafmanThere are many graffiti books and photographers dedicated to documenting graffiti walls and tags because they are by their very nature temporary. To my limited knowledge, no one outside of the graffiti crew members themselves has documented the internal culture of crews, as well as their impact on each other and the art world. My interest in graffiti stemmed from a one time collaborative project funded by Ed and Brandy Sweeney and compiled through the J. Paul Getty Trust called: LA Liber Amicorum, which literally translates to “LA Book of Friends” Graffiti artists use black art books to tag and network within and through various crews. This Liber Amicorum is popularly known as the Getty Graffiti Black Book. There was also an accompanying 2014 exhibit at ESMOA: Scratch.Several members of the JOR and MTA crews that I have met were artists featured in the LA Liber Amicorum such as EDER, BLOSM and GASOLINE. You can page through the whole book here. I could not believe my luck when I met the crew members themselves and they were so friendly and willing to answer my many questions. Over time they began to trust that I would capture their group with integrity and authenticity, while at the same time maintaining the anonymity of the members who do not wish to be known publicly. What I have seen and hope that I capture is the culture, camaraderie, and support for the creative endeavors of longtime friends and newcomers alike who crave artistic expression.You can view some of the work from the last several months that I have featured on my photographer alter ego, AINE’s web journal:Grace and Graffiti: Images from JS_JOR's 25th ReunionA+D Museum Opening Gala: JOR members painted a muralA+D Museum's Beyond Graffiti exhibit closing nightA+D Museum's Beyond Graffiti exhibit wall painting and How I Met the CrewOther Ways You Can HelpI know not everyone can contribute monetarily.

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>The show, broadcasting from TradioV, has enabled Creatives to shine in a reputable and celebrity ridden studio
right in the heart of Hollywood, and the production is now a respected and recognizable brand.</p>
<p>But there is much more
blood, sweat and tears to add to the pot. This show is by and for the Creatives and supporters of the Creative
Culture and has the ability to make a difference … with collaboration

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Let’s face it, being
SEEN IN THE CROWD can be difficult, but that is exactly the point. After
spending the last 10 years promoting THE ARTS, it has become crystal clear that
MEDIA, especially LIVE BROADCASTING with ARCHIVED LINKS is the most effective way for Creatives to be seen and recognized. 
That said, the intent of this show is to broaden
awareness of members of the Creative Culture, exposing them to a wider spread
public eye than is possible with only specific venue appearances and
exhibitions.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440577431/lejqechojkqpu0vdkgyx.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 301.333px; height: 226px;""/>                          <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440575111/buewokbpuz9cojekgw7a.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 171.75px; height: 229px;""/></p>
<p>I have been on the
front line of art promotion, traveling around the US and abroad, for many years
now. I have witnessed the strong desire of the artist. I have also witnessed the demise of the
art world, on many counts. It’s not good enough to be amazing at your craft;
the magic lies in the recognition and PROMOTION of that talent. That is what this show provides ... with the potential to promote on an even larger scale ... with a taller soapbox! </p>

<p></p></div>","Short Summary 
My name
is Polina Hryn and I am the Host aka Instigator of The PO SHO in Hollywood, CA broadcasting
LIVE weekly from TradioV. I am also the producer of this show, which focuses on
Promoting THE ARTS and Elevating THE CREATIVE CULTURE.
     Previously,
I co-hosted ""The Artful Undress"" on TradioV, ""Spoken Word /
Spoken Song"" at kx@onelaguna, and ""The Love Lab"" at
kx@onelaguna, and am the Founder of ""WET PUZZLE PIECE Productions."" I
am a Media Personality, Producer, Artist, Writer and Promoter of THE ARTS, elevating
ARTISTS OF ALL GENRES AND MEDIA.

TradioV (Radio in TV) is a division of Zinna Media Group (ZMG), which currently reaches over 60 million people worldwide each
month. The TradioV broadcast studio, located in Hollywood, CA, focuses on

& Shakespeare ... Chefs & Mixologists to Burlesque & Comedy ... 


With a long
awaited new renaissance, the Creative Culture, emerging from the depths ... and
standing at the cusp of a defined movement and time period, I am hell bent on
elevating the Creatives to their rightful place ... this is my passion!
My intent
is to bring THE ARTS to the forefront, empowering communities, organizations
and people to wield their innate creativity as a means to stimulate and achieve
abundance and wellbeing.

The Impact 
The show, broadcasting from TradioV, has enabled Creatives to shine in a reputable and celebrity ridden studio
right in the heart of Hollywood, and the production is now a respected and recognizable brand.
But there is much more
blood, sweat and tears to add to the pot. This show is by and for the Creatives and supporters of the Creative
Culture and has the ability to make a difference … with collaboration
and banding together, The PO SHO will GROW … fo sho!

          

Risks & Challenges  
Let’s face it, being
SEEN IN THE CROWD can be difficult, but that is exactly the point. After
spending the last 10 years promoting THE ARTS, it has become crystal clear that
MEDIA, especially LIVE BROADCASTING with ARCHIVED LINKS is the most effective way for Creatives to be seen and recognized. 
That said, the intent of this show is to broaden
awareness of members of the Creative Culture, exposing them to a wider spread
public eye than is possible with only specific venue appearances and
exhibitions.

                          
I have been on the
front line of art promotion, traveling around the US and abroad, for many years
now. I have witnessed the strong desire of the artist. I have also witnessed the demise of the
art world, on many counts. It’s not good enough to be amazing at your craft;
the magic lies in the recognition and PROMOTION of that talent. That is what this show provides ... with the potential to promote on an even larger scale ... with a taller soapbox! 

       


Other Ways You Can Help 

Being unable to contribute monetarily is completely
understandable. The great thing is … you can still help LOADS by supporting the
show … by watching, calling in, and SHARING. In media, views matter! SHOUT from
the rooftops at the top of your lungs, “WATCH AND SHARE THE PO SHO!” and “HELP
PO ELEVATE THE CREATIVE CULTURE … GIVE WHAT YOU CAN!

It keeps us relevant. <br/><br/><p>As a curatorial collective we hold ourselves to a high standard - despite the fact that WRECK CITY is an independent group, we've always been <b>dedicated to paying professional fees to participating artists</b>. We know what it’s like to survive on an artist’s salary, and it’s insanely hard. We try our <i>very best</i> never to ask our peers to do something for nothing! Subsequently, Artist Fees take up a huge part of our budget - as they should! Similarly, we cover the basic necessities of these projects - onsite prep, health + safety, posters, print materials, administrative costs, some equipment, web presence, documentation, etc. The back-end of this thing is big and bulky, and powered primarily by the blood, sweat, tears, and stubbornness of WRECK CITY and Participants. Your funding will be used responsibly, but it will also make a BIG DIFFERENCE to us.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434171821/mgvo4klpkkc13fmyayxe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>Luckily, DEMO TAPE is over 2/3 funded by <a href=""http://www.affta.ab.ca/Home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alberta Foundation for the Arts</a> and <a href=""http://www.canadacouncil.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Canada Council for the Arts</a>. However, we still have a good deal of outstanding expenses. So we're taking advantage of both interpretations of the phrase ""Change Machine"" and asking for your change! <b>We're trying to raise $7,500 by the time we have to vacate Penguin Car Wash --- July 1, 2015! </b><br/></p><p>Most of the people in our social circles can't give a lot - and we totally understand this! - but <b>whether you help spread the word of this campaign, give us a few of your hard-earned dollars, or attend the DEMO TAPE events, you're helping support us </b>more than you know. <b>Thank You! </b>Thank you for even looking at our Crowd-Funding Campaign page!! That's half the battle.</p><p>There’s also this thing about shared ownership. If you decide to help fund this project,
 you’re not buying anything - you’re making a statement. One of WRECK 
CITY’s Curators recently said “every dollar is a vote.” While she was 
talking about how people should spend their money in general, that idea 
translates to this campaign perfectly. <b>By investing in WRECK CITY, you’re saying 
that you want to see more projects like DEMO TAPE, PHANTOM WING, and WRECK CITY: an epilogue for 809</b>.  You’re saying that 
you believe WRECK CITY does a valuable thing in Calgary, and you'd like to see it continue. You’re investing in an experimental subversion of civic space and the perpetuation of an awesome community. You're also supporting an all-ages, free, public experience! At the end of the day, we like to think that <b>you're investing in the future...</b><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434171668/fcibqc5sfoqetjkmoaa3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>WHAT HAPPENS IF OUR CAMPAIGN EXCEEDS ITS GOAL?</b><br/></p><p>If WRECK CITY's Crowd-Funding Campaign <b>exceeds $10,000, we'll commit to a 4th project.</b> That is, we'll make ourselves a nest egg so we can take on new alternative spaces sometime in the future with less warning and more preparation. <b>If this crowd-funding campaign SOMEHOW exceeds $50,000, we'll commit to a 4th project within the next year!!!</b> Not to get ahead of ourselves, of course - we're crossing our fingers for 7.5 grand - but we'll take what we can get!<br/></p><p>The value of art is often intangible, and it’s impossible to measure within traditional value systems.

We're WRECK CITY, an independent curatorial collective that organizes experimental art exhibitions in alternative and pre-demolition spaces. WRECK CITY is comprised of 8 ""artist-curators"" with an ongoing interest in DIY-subcultures and alternative spaces: Matthew Bourree, Caitlind r.c. Brown, Jennifer Crighton, Brandon Dalmer, Andrew Frosst, John Frosst, Natalie MacLean, and Shawn Mankowske. Between us, we've founded galleries, instigated long-term 
collectives, run festivals, toured art around the world, and played a humble but measurable role in shaping the foundation of independent art in Calgary. You can find our full mandate on our website (www.wreckcity.ca) but essentially WRECK CITY believes in art’s radical potential to permeate familiar spaces, grow new communities, and continually create fresh understandings of our particular time and place. We're interested in critiquing the potentials of unused urban spaces and the role of art in expanding the way we look at our cities, communities, and art scenes. Our previous projects, WRECK CITY: an epilogue for 809 and PHANTOM WING, collectively involved new works by over 150 artists, transforming (respectively) an entire neighbourhood of houses scheduled for demolition, and the 1960s wing of an abandoned school. Despite extremely humble beginnings and a roller coaster ride of trials and tribulations, both WRECK CITY's projects were met with voracious support from a diverse Calgary audience, gleaning viewership by 13,000+ visitors to date.WHAT'S DEMO TAPE?It's been two years since our last curatorial project, and WRECK CITY is finally ramping up to launch DEMO TAPE, a new site-specific art exhibition at the old Penguin Car Wash in Ramsay (Calgary). Presented in conjunction with Sled Island Music + Arts Festival, we've invited 50 artists, musicians, writers, and performers to respond to the defunct car wash, working onsite for one month. Within this raw, utilitarian, and malleable context (not unlike a garage jam-space), artists are free to significantly alter spaces, empowered by the understanding that their work will eventually be destroyed along with the surrounding building. Originally instigated to explore the intersections between music + art, DEMO TAPE has evolved into a broader examination of sound + image, action + object, transient + solid, invisible + visible. Just as the overall exhibition overlaps with Sled Island, DEMO TAPE artists explore the overlap between various disciplines, with a focus on ideas of change over time. WRECK CITY exhibits work that is site-specific, experiential, subversive, immersive, interactive, and encompassing, and DEMO TAPE will certainly reflect that focus. This is NOT an exhibition where canvases are hung on walls, this is a place for rupturing previously-existing definitions of art and forging new territory, furthering contemporary dialogues while poking fun at dominant cultures. All of us - Artists & Curators alike - take this pursuit seriously... but we're totally down to joke about it. The final form of DEMO TAPE will be a public experiment - we suspect that the artists will surprise us all!WHO ARE THE ARTISTS BEHIND DEMO TAPE?
There
are about 50 artists, musicians, and
performers participating in DEMO TAPE, including: Aaron Moran; Alia Shabab & Michel Gignac; Ben Nixon & Rachelle Quinn; Chelsea Allard & Steele Duncan (#TROMGROP); Desiree Nault & Lane Shordee; Don Hill, Jayda

For the
second time, we're delighted to include two Writers-in-Residence: Jenna
Swift and JD Mersault. 
See here for bios & project descriptions (the projects are so awesome! Please take a look! Please do!)WHY CROWD-FUND DEMO TAPE?Obviously, the catch to instigating projects like this is that, at some point, we have to figure out a way to fund them. Because they're free and open to everyone (which is very important to us) crowd-funding plays a huge role in the sustainability of WRECK CITY, alongside grants, sponsorships, and larger donations - when we're lucky!Subsequently, the future of WRECK CITY is always unknown, but this is actually kind of useful: we're flexible to react to situations as they come our way. It keeps us relevant. As a curatorial collective we hold ourselves to a high standard - despite the fact that WRECK CITY is an independent group, we've always been dedicated to paying professional fees to participating artists. We know what it’s like to survive on an artist’s salary, and it’s insanely hard. We try our very best never to ask our peers to do something for nothing! Subsequently, Artist Fees take up a huge part of our budget - as they should! Similarly, we cover the basic necessities of these projects - onsite prep, health + safety, posters, print materials, administrative costs, some equipment, web presence, documentation, etc. The back-end of this thing is big and bulky, and powered primarily by the blood, sweat, tears, and stubbornness of WRECK CITY and Participants. Your funding will be used responsibly, but it will also make a BIG DIFFERENCE to us.Luckily, DEMO TAPE is over 2/3 funded by Alberta Foundation for the Arts and Canada Council for the Arts. However, we still have a good deal of outstanding expenses. So we're taking advantage of both interpretations of the phrase ""Change Machine"" and asking for your change! We're trying to raise $7,500 by the time we have to vacate Penguin Car Wash --- July 1, 2015! Most of the people in our social circles can't give a lot - and we totally understand this! - but whether you help spread the word of this campaign, give us a few of your hard-earned dollars, or attend the DEMO TAPE events, you're helping support us more than you know. Thank You! Thank you for even looking at our Crowd-Funding Campaign page!! That's half the battle.There’s also this thing about shared ownership. If you decide to help fund this project,
 you’re not buying anything - you’re making a statement. One of WRECK 
CITY’s Curators recently said “every dollar is a vote.” While she was 
talking about how people should spend their money in general, that idea 
translates to this campaign perfectly. By investing in WRECK CITY, you’re saying 
that you want to see more projects like DEMO TAPE, PHANTOM WING, and WRECK CITY: an epilogue for 809.  You’re saying that 
you believe WRECK CITY does a valuable thing in Calgary, and you'd like to see it continue. You’re investing in an experimental subversion of civic space and the perpetuation of an awesome community. You're also supporting an all-ages, free, public experience! At the end of the day, we like to think that you're investing in the future...WHAT HAPPENS IF OUR CAMPAIGN EXCEEDS ITS GOAL?If WRECK CITY's Crowd-Funding Campaign exceeds $10,000, we'll commit to a 4th project. That is, we'll make ourselves a nest egg so we can take on new alternative spaces sometime in the future with less warning and more preparation. If this crowd-funding campaign SOMEHOW exceeds $50,000, we'll commit to a 4th project within the next year!!! Not to get ahead of ourselves, of course - we're crossing our fingers for 7.5 grand - but we'll take what we can get!The value of art is often intangible, and it’s impossible to measure within traditional value systems. You plant art like a seed in the underground, and it grows, branches out, and develops into something that was once unimaginable.  Artists are peddlers of culture, reflectors of the present, and bellwethers for the future. Despite the fact that the work commissioned by WRECK CITY is often ephemeral, we truly believe in its value. Come see DEMO TAPE!

""Why teach art? I thought kids who “got it” just do what they do."" EVERYTHING that I know as an artist was taught to me before I took the
time to develop it. I've always been talented in many things, but genuine
wisdom and growth comes from the seed of knowledge planted by those who loved
me enough to teach me what they know. I teach Art to give students the tools
that they need to understand the visual world that surrounds them and to
express the greatness within them. To expect the artistically talented in the
world to only consist of child prodigies is like expecting only the hyperlexic
to be able to read. No one would today, would deny the billions of us that
required education to become literate. Everything that makes us human is
amplified by the shared knowledge of those who are wiser than ourselves. I
would not be the artist I am today without my former art teachers. Because of

     am Reshada Pullen-Jireh!  I am a
     professional teaching artist living just outside of Washington, DC.  I have over 10 years teaching
     experience.  I currently teach art for DC Scholars Public Charter Schools .  I am a prolific painter, and I paint
     live at various events in the Metro DC Area.  I am currently the resident artist for
     Wednesday Verses, and Busboys and Poets at 14th and V and
     Hyattsville, MD.



After all of
     these years of teaching and creating, I’ve finally decided to apply to
     grad school to earn my Masters in Art Education.  I’ve been accepted into Maryland
     Institute College of Art located in Baltimore Maryland.  MICA offers art teachers the opportunity
     to earn their Masters of Art Education over a 14 month program, with two
     intense summers and online courses during the academic year.

I’ve been
     awarded $20,000 in scholarships to be distributed across two summers,
     which is a tremendous blessing, but it is not enough to cover
     everything.  I am asking for your
     patronage to help me reach my first goal of $16,500 to help me get
     started. In exchange for postcards, matted prints, limited edition canvas
     prints, live painting, and custom created artwork available in various
     sizes! 


Every now and then I am asked,
""Why teach art? I thought kids who “got it” just do what they do."" EVERYTHING that I know as an artist was taught to me before I took the
time to develop it. I've always been talented in many things, but genuine
wisdom and growth comes from the seed of knowledge planted by those who loved
me enough to teach me what they know. I teach Art to give students the tools
that they need to understand the visual world that surrounds them and to
express the greatness within them. To expect the artistically talented in the
world to only consist of child prodigies is like expecting only the hyperlexic
to be able to read. No one would today, would deny the billions of us that
required education to become literate. Everything that makes us human is
amplified by the shared knowledge of those who are wiser than ourselves. I
would not be the artist I am today without my former art teachers. Because of
them, I know how to live my life learning, creating, growing and sharing. I
want to continue do the same for my own students and empower those who would be
art teachers to so effectively for generations to come.In order to attend MICA this summer we’re
raising $16,500 to cover:
Fees
     from IndieGogo (9% if we don't meet our goal, 4% if we do), Paypal (3%)
     and Credit Cards (3%)

And a
video message sent via email, thanking you for your support. Risks & ChallengesMany of you may ask “Reshada, you are a
working grad school student, when will you have time to produce all of the
prizes that you listed?”  Truthfully, the
prizes are from my visual arts business. 
I have all of the standard and limited edition canvas prints in my
inventory. A large part of my graduate study requires that I continue doing what
I am doing now, teaching and painting. 
I am asking that if you’ve ever thought of owning a piece of my art, to
make now the time to become a patron.  If
you’ve never seen my art prior to viewing this campaign, check out my website www.reshadapullenjireh.com.  I would love your patronage and support.If I don’t reach my goals, all funds
contributed will still go to support my graduate studies at the Maryland
Institute College of Art. And your physical prizes will still be fulfilled
between June 14, 2015 and December 1, 2015 for printed works.  Original Custom Pieces may take longer.  The fulfillment of live painting prizes depends on the scheduling of the
event.If I exceed my goals, the funds will support
my tuition and fees for 2016, and future gallery exhibits of my work.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are not in the position to donate funds
in exchange for art right now, its okay, I’ve been there before.  You can still help by sharing this campaign
via social media on facebook, twitter, instagram, or whatever sites you like
the most!You can also use
     the indiegogo share toolsThank
you all so much for your support!",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><br/><h2>Challenges</h2> Our
 challenge in printing and publishing Star Seed Whisper, is to get 
superbly fine art books. Editorial challenge is covered, since we will 
be working with a well established publisher who has printed many fine 
art photography books before. Expedition challenges are the ground we 
have to cover in a specific time frame, and being in intimate contact 
with members of the communities. This challenge also is covered, by 
people we know personally who live and are members of the ethnic groups 
that we will be visiting.<p></p>

STAR  SEED WHISPER
﻿
Star Seed Whisper is a cultural research of American & African ethnic groups 
depicted in a fine art photography book through contemporary art venues.  Our 
goal is to create bridges between native and contemporary cultures  by showing 
their sociocultural ties through visual arts.

Emerging from fine art photographs of African and Central American ethnic 
groups and mixed media visual arts, Star Seed Whisper is bound with a series of 
art residencies / exhibitions in cities such as:  Chiyoda, Tokyo,  Berlin,  Beijing, 
Budapest,  Dubai,  Hong Kong,  New York,  London,  Paris,  Saudi Arabia,  
Stockholm,  and Zurich.
 
Star Seed Whisper collaborated with established and emerging performance
artists from each city and country, carrying out open studios, lectures, and 
workshops, thus creating a contemporary art dialogue between cultures.
﻿
By contributing whit these program  we will be able to achieve
Cultural research (Photo expedition)
Book publication
Art residencies / exhibition
Cultural exchange

CULTURAL RESEARCH

The photography and audio expedition will begin in the Central America region 
of Guatemala and its’ borders within South America's dense forest of the Darien 
province in Panama (which also borders with Colombia).  I will then visit the 
Dogon people living the central plateau region of Mali, West Africa, as well as 
South Sudan, touring the east of the continent into Ethiopia's southern nation of 
the Omo valley.        
 The Miskito: from Cape Camarón Honduras to Río Grande Nicaragua.
 The Bribris and Gnassos (Teribe): Territory extends the border 
between Costa Rica and Panama. 
 The Ngobe -Bugle (Guaymí): Western mountainous areas of Bocas Del 
Toro, Panama.

Challenges Our
 challenge in printing and publishing Star Seed Whisper, is to get 
superbly fine art books. Editorial challenge is covered, since we will 
be working with a well established publisher who has printed many fine 
art photography books before. Expedition challenges are the ground we 
have to cover in a specific time frame, and being in intimate contact 
with members of the communities. This challenge also is covered, by 
people we know personally who live and are members of the ethnic groups 
that we will be visiting.",35.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p>
<p>In March, we had the pleasure to host the group of American women quilters and students from New York University in Morocco, where we held an exhibition of their collective pieces and documentary film and photographs and conducted several workshops on the American women's textile techniques with Moroccan women from the project that was also open to the public.</p>
<p>This June, it is the Moroccan group's turn to travel to the United States, where the Moroccan women and students will have the chance to visit New York City and Philadelphia, and exhibit their work at the Fabric Workshop and Museum. This is an once in a lifetime opportunity for these women, specifically, most of them who have never traveled outside of their home country, to learn about the American culture and way of life.</p>

This trip to the United States will allow the Moroccan participants to discover another culture, explore new ways to develop their creativity, and learn new skills. <b><br/><br/>What we need and your thank's gift</b><br/><br/>For each women, the total travel costs are equivalent to $4,080, which covers the following costs:<br/>
<p>Flight (roundtrip): $1,800</p>
<p>Lodging in New York and Philadelphia: $1,440</p>
<p>Meals: $480</p>
<p>Passport and visa: $240</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm a full time worker who tries to be a <a href=""http://instagram.com/neccaristanbul"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">knifemaker</a>. This campaign is needed because i need some tools and a workshop in order to grow and to be a professional. I'll be apriciated if you can help me to reach my goal!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let me give you all the detail about campaign;</p>
<ul>
<li>The total amount of money needed is $3000 and here is the breakdown;<ul>
<li>$520 - <a href=""http://www.haznedarmakine.com/iki-makarali-bant-zimpara-makinesi-model1-133"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Belt Grinder </a>
</li>
<li>$650 -  <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Cut-Band-Saw-Kit/dp/B00D5QEV92/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1513164193&amp;sr=8-9&amp;keywords=milwaukee+deep+cut+bandsaw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Milwaukee Band Saw </a>(Turkey Price)</li>
<li>$1300 - 10 Months of Workshop Rent ($130 each month) </li>
<li>~$530 - Workshop Construction &amp; small tools and furniture</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even if i dont reach my $3000 goal, i'll use every penny to my knifemaking story. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If i dont get a workshop and the tools i need, i'll stay as a hobbyist and who knows maybe one day i have to leave knifemaking because of the hardwork without tools &amp; absent of the space i need. </p>
<ul>
<li>Knifemaking by hand is still an art and has to live around the world. I'm another knifemaker who tries to ensure knifemaking  is continuing around the world. </li>
<li>I'm already making knifes but one knife takes 2 or 3 weeks to complete. You can check my works at my <a href=""http://instagram.com/neccaristanbul"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">instagram page</a>! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As i mention before, i'm doing knifes in my balcony (hardly 2 or 3 square meter) and it is too small for this kind of job. There will be some health issues (lack of the air ventilation) &amp; noise about the getting more and more problem since i'm living in apartment. </p>
<p>If i'll have a workshop, i can overcome these problems and make knifes more qualified and more clean. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you dont contribute my project, at least share this page on your facebook and instagram accounts to help me! </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

The total amount of money needed is $3000 and here is the breakdown;
$520 - Belt Grinder 

$650 -  Milwaukee Band Saw (Turkey Price)
$1300 - 10 Months of Workshop Rent ($130 each month) 
~$530 - Workshop Construction & small tools and furniture


Even if i dont reach my $3000 goal, i'll use every penny to my knifemaking story. 


The Impact
If i dont get a workshop and the tools i need, i'll stay as a hobbyist and who knows maybe one day i have to leave knifemaking because of the hardwork without tools & absent of the space i need. 

Knifemaking by hand is still an art and has to live around the world. I'm another knifemaker who tries to ensure knifemaking  is continuing around the world. 
I'm already making knifes but one knife takes 2 or 3 weeks to complete. You can check my works at my instagram page! 


Risks & Challenges
As i mention before, i'm doing knifes in my balcony (hardly 2 or 3 square meter) and it is too small for this kind of job. There will be some health issues (lack of the air ventilation) & noise about the getting more and more problem since i'm living in apartment. 
If i'll have a workshop, i can overcome these problems and make knifes more qualified and more clean. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you dont contribute my project, at least share this page on your facebook and instagram accounts to help me!

<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>Boston is viewed around the world as a leader in entrepreneurship, technology, science, academics and medicine. Much of the work that happens here - from the pioneering to the everyday - relies on the integral contributions of foreign-born residents. </p>
<p>Twenty percent of Massachusetts entrepreneurs are foreign-born and they collectively employ nearly 135,000 workers, according to a study by New American Economy. Immigrants also account for significant portions of entire job categories in Massachusetts: housekeepers (65%), medical scientists (59%), head chefs (44%), software developers (35%), doctors and surgeons (34%), and manufacturing workers (34%) - according to the most recent census data.</p>

<p>But Boston is only one part of a national conversation. The travel bans, anti-immigrant rhetoric, and nationalist leanings in Washington white-wash our history as a nation of immigrants. And they slam the door on the flow of visitors, immigrants and refugees who have enriched our nation with their ideas, dreams, drive, culture and entrepreneurship.</p>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>The goals of this project are education, inspiration, and dialogue.  The project succeeds:</p>

<p>When a passerby pauses at a projection and leaves buoyed by its beauty and message of inclusion. </p>

<p>Hiyeee! My name is Helen Schmidt. I'm a Tarot Reader based in Los Angeles. I'm a lifelong student of Mysticism with over 5 years of professional experience with Tarot. I've got to work with some rad companies like Teva, Vitruvi, Unique Markets, Savoir Collab, and Gladys Tamez. I am the Zodiac Tarotscope writer for <a href=""https://www.ohholisticism.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Oh </i></a><i><a href=""https://www.ohholisticism.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Holisticism</a></i>. I was the official Tarot Reader for Lightning in a Bottle in 2016. And just 3-months ago, I launched my brand <strong>A B R A B I N A H</strong>. It means<i> I will create through feminine reasoning</i>. It is a platform for not too woo (but woo) feminine reasoners. The deck for this campaign will be one of the main tools offered on this platform.</p>
<p>About a year ago I had the vision to combine my skills as a Graphic Designer with my love for Tarot to create a Tarot Deck. Something I noticed immediately with Tarot was how old-school and a little out there it can be. So, I wanted to change that with this deck and along the way I got to dive deeper with myself, discover who I am, discover why I am who I am, and learn how to express it.</p>

<p>The three words I would describe my deck would be sultry, sophisticated and simple. It pairs nicely with a glass of Rosé and a fireplace. It is loosely based off of my first love, the Crowley-Thoth tarot deck. This set will come with 78 cards, a guide booklet, and a matchbook box.</p>
<p>Here's a little teaser of the deck...</p>

<h3><b>""Sounds great! How can I help?""</b></h3>
<h4><b>By supporting us financially</b></h4>
<p>We do need some funds to get the BETA phase going, and it would really help if you could donate any amount with which you're comfortable to help us get there. Below are our estimated running costs:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1202767/files/20150206231925-Cost_piechart.png?1423293565"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/><p>We'll probably need to crowd-source funding (again!) for the permanent app when the time comes, but we're really looking to get started on the BETA phase first. No counting chicks before getting the hens, and all that. </p>
<p>Still, if we are able -- due to your astounding show of generosity -- able to to reach our goal for the BETA phase, the rest of the money donated will be put aside to fund the development and running of the permanent app, thus saving us the need to crowd-source these funds in the future (you'll see above that this crowd-sourcing endeavour actually loses us a good chunk of your donations in the process, in payments to Indiegogo and the banks for their services). </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><b>""Okay, but don't you people have any perks? You know, stuff I get for giving you my money?""</b></h4>
<p>Hmm, we don't see it that way, actually. We aren't producing a product that you can get for x% off for supporting its initial run; we're humbly seeking donations to develop an app that can benefit the conservation community (and by extension, everyone who benefits from our work) at large. </p>
<p>So essentially, we're afraid you won't be ""getting stuff"" when you donate to us. Instead, we'd like to offer you our appreciation in the form of listing you as a supporter on the app when it launches,and sending you a physical token of this appreciation (tied to your contribution level) as a little memento.  We'd like to take this opportunity to thank “The Conservator” for generously agreeing to let us print two comics on stickers to be given as tokens of appreciation to campaign supporters! </p>
<p>These are the tokens of appreciation we’ll be mailing out to you at each level of support. Shipping across the globe included! Don’t worry about needing to donate the exact minimum listed for a particular Indiegogo “perk”, if that’s a token you’re particularly keen on – you can always indicate a higher amount on the next page after clicking on the perk level in which you’re interested. We’ve only tied the perks to specific contribution levels because of the manufacturing costs associated with each token we’ve chosen!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The “Almost Famous” Perk </b>(min. donation USD2)</p>
<p>To show our appreciation and welcome you into the ConsKit community, we'll list you -- and all other donors above this level of support -- as a supporter on the app when it launches. Don't forget to share your contribution on Facebook!</p>
<p>We’ll keep you updated about our progress!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The “Sticker Picker” Perk</b> (min. donation USD10)</p>

<p><b>The “Welcome Aboard!” (Limited Edition) Perk </b>(min. donation USD80)</p>
<p>Atthis level of contribution, you (or whoever chauffeurs you around on a regular/semi-regular basis) get to declare your support for ConsKit <i>and</i> caution those pesky tailgaters with a limited-edition car decal!  Alternatively, stick it on the inside of a clear folder and bring it to your next meeting.  Either way, we're so glad you're supporting our campaign!

<br/><br/><p><b>The “Take One for the Team” Perk </b>(min. donation USD140)</p>
<p>Thank you for supporting ConsKit! To celebrate teamwork within conservation, your team of up to five members will each get a ConsKit pencil, a sticker of your choice, and a <i>personalised engraved pencil </i>with your team slogan or department name on it (up to 30 characters)! We’ll send you an email requesting for more details for the personalisation when the campaign ends. Don’t forget to take a picture of you and your team using your pencils, and post it on social media with the hashtag #ConsKit! </p>

<p>Here’s a token of appreciation larger teams can share! At this level of contribution, your team of up to ten members will each get a ConsKit pencil, a sticker of your choice, and a personalised engraved pencil with your team slogan or department name on it (up to 30 characters)! We’ll send you an email requesting for more details for the personalisation when the campaign ends.

<br/><h3 style=""text-align: justify;""><b>""Why Asia-Pacific? What about the rest of the
world?"" </b></h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We decided to focus on Asia-Pacific at the
BETA stage in order to extend the network support in the region, as there isn't
currently a platform for all existing Asia-Pacific network groups. If you're a
caretaker of a collection with an Asia-Pacific focus, it's likely that you'll
have specific needs, whether related to environmental concerns or cultural
sensitivity, and a platform on which you can share your knowledge and expertise
would really go a long way in developing conservation in the region. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Also, an app with regional-focus will help you
reduce your carbon footprint when ordering archival-grade supplies from
manufacturers in the region. Just think about the fuel you'll save -- not
counting the reduction in shipping time! -- when ordering from within
Asia-Pacific, as opposed to across the globe. </p>

The “Almost Famous” Perk (min. donation USD2)
To show our appreciation and welcome you into the ConsKit community, we'll list you -- and all other donors above this level of support -- as a supporter on the app when it launches. Don't forget to share your contribution on Facebook!
We’ll keep you updated about our progress!

The “Sticker Picker” Perk (min. donation USD10)
We'd like to offer you one of our two sticker designs as a token of our appreciation. Happy choosing! Both comics provided with the generous support of “The Conservator”. Do visit the website (https://theconservator.wordpress.com/) to take a look at other works! Don't worry about picking the design right now -- we'll send a request for your choice when the campaign ends!
 
Sticker 1: Broken Hearts

Sticker 2: In the Lab
The “Time to Pencil it in” Perk (min. donation USD15)
We're so grateful for your contribution, we're sending you a pencil! Besides being part of any conservator's kit, this little token is also a reminder that you're a part of the Conservators' Kit! (If you cringed, please don't send us hate mail -- just select another perk ;) )

The “Two’s Company” Perk (min. donation USD25)
To show our appreciation for your generous contribution, we’re sending you a sticker and a pencil (both featured above)! You’ll get to choose between two sticker designs, and both comics are provided with the generous support of “The Conservator”. Do visit the website (https://theconservator.wordpress.com/) to take a look at other works! Don't worry about picking the design right now -- we'll send a request for your choice when the campaign ends!

The “Share a Pair” Perk (min. donation USD45)
To let you share your excitement about ConsKit with a friend, we’re sending you two sets of the above (so that's two stickers and two pencils)! Snap a picture of you and your friend using your pencils, and post it on social media with the hashtag #ConsKit. Welcome to the ConsKit community! 

The “Welcome Aboard!” (Limited Edition) Perk (min. donation USD80)
Atthis level of contribution, you (or whoever chauffeurs you around on a regular/semi-regular basis) get to declare your support for ConsKit and caution those pesky tailgaters with a limited-edition car decal!  Alternatively, stick it on the inside of a clear folder and bring it to your next meeting.  Either way, we're so glad you're supporting our campaign! Don’t forget to 'document' how you’ve decided to use your decal, and post it on social media with the hashtag #ConsKit!

The “Take One for the Team” Perk (min. donation USD140)
Thank you for supporting ConsKit! To celebrate teamwork within conservation, your team of up to five members will each get a ConsKit pencil, a sticker of your choice, and a personalised engraved pencil with your team slogan or department name on it (up to 30 characters)! We’ll send you an email requesting for more details for the personalisation when the campaign ends. Don’t forget to take a picture of you and your team using your pencils, and post it on social media with the hashtag #ConsKit! 
The “Smells Like Team Spirit” Perk (min. donation USD230)
Here’s a token of appreciation larger teams can share! At this level of contribution, your team of up to ten members will each get a ConsKit pencil, a sticker of your choice, and a personalised engraved pencil with your team slogan or department name on it (up to 30 characters)! We’ll send you an email requesting for more details for the personalisation when the campaign ends. Don’t forget to take a picture of you and your team using your pencils, and post it on social media with the hashtag #ConsKit!


“That’s all fine and dandy, but I don’t want your stuff, I just want to see that this app gets made!”
That’s very generous of you! We’d love to mail you a little something for you to remember us by, but if you’d rather not receive anything, we’re more than happy to graciously accept your kind donation as well. You’ll be able to specify the amount you wish to contribute, and indicate if you’d rather not receive any “perk” from us when you click “CONTRIBUTE NOW”.
""Why Asia-Pacific? What about the rest of the
world?"" 
We decided to focus on Asia-Pacific at the
BETA stage in order to extend the network support in the region, as there isn't
currently a platform for all existing Asia-Pacific network groups. If you're a
caretaker of a collection with an Asia-Pacific focus, it's likely that you'll
have specific needs, whether related to environmental concerns or cultural
sensitivity, and a platform on which you can share your knowledge and expertise
would really go a long way in developing conservation in the region. 
Also, an app with regional-focus will help you
reduce your carbon footprint when ordering archival-grade supplies from
manufacturers in the region. Just think about the fuel you'll save -- not
counting the reduction in shipping time! -- when ordering from within
Asia-Pacific, as opposed to across the globe. 
That said, we aren't ignoring the rest of the
world! In fact, we've received some very encouraging messages from conservators
across the world, and we are considering developing ConsKit on
a more international platform in future -- while of course retaining its
regional specificity for the reasons above -- but that's all rather contingent
on our successfully launching ConsKit's BETA phase first!
 


And if you can't quite rub two coins together, you could... 

Spread the word, and encourage others who benefit from the conservation practice to donate their hard-earned money to our campaign.
Like us on Facebook, and join our mailing list for updates, hoping that enough people will provide the necessary financial support to our campaign to allow us to actually have updates. 
Don't worry, we're just kidding about the last part. We completely empathise if you can't support us financially. That's really okay! Just drop us an encouraging message to make our day, and get word about our campaign out there, then join us on the app when it's up and running! 


Risks and Challenges


The success of this app will be heavily dependent on network support, and the active contribution of app users. As such, we will be publicising both this campaign and the app when it is developed on network newsletters, and on Facebook, where we already have a landing page. 
We realise that conservation is very much a niche field, and the pool of individuals who might have personal incentives to support our fundraising campaign is, in reality, quite small. We really are depending on the generosity of those who can give to help make this app happen. 


Thanks once again to everyone who’s expressed interest in
our project, and we hope that we’ll all be able to benefit from this amazing
app very soon!

<div> <h3>The Six Comforts book, an cyclical work of text and image by artist Christopher Gustave, must not be lost to obscurity.</h3>
<p>Christopher Gustave’s immense conceptual art book “The Six
Comforts”, 344 pages in total, more than 308 full color plates, will be printed as a
tightly-limited edition. We need to pre-sell <strike>230 books in 40 days</strike> 130 books in 6 days. Contribute $100 and receive Christopher Gustave's last art work: The Six Comforts.</p>
<p>Gustave conceived of the Six Comforts as a method for living in
response to personal tragedy, primarily the death by heroin overdose of his
best friend, Daniel Brack, in San Francisco, on September 13th, 1996. Over the
next several years, he focused his creative output in book-design, conceptual
art, collage and assemblage within a framework of this “sorting construct” of
the Six Comforts: key components of a method of living in opposition to
super-cultural alienation, and unrecoverable loss.</p>
<p><i>""The Six Comforts are Home, Sleep, Work, Love, Food and
Self.</i> <i>The Six
Comforts’ is a sorting construct I formulated around the summer of 1997. At
that point in my life I had just endured a blistering spate of profoundly bad
luck—death, divorce, unemployment, homelessness… you name it—and I was in a
deep state of emotional turmoil and mental resignation… really heart-broken and
bereft of hope. Life nearly unendurable and all that. </i><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">However, given a little time, it was pretty clear that, in
spite of all of this, I was not going to just stop living. I had resigned
myself to the Nietzschean formula (“That which does not kill us…”). Part of my
survival regimen at that time was to simply sort out what I most needed in
order to keep on going and just focus on those basics; get myself back into a
healthy, sane and productive place. So, those “basics” became ‘The Six
Comforts’."" — Christopher Gustave, 2002.</i></p>
<p>The work “The Six Comforts” existed primarily in book-page
spreads, diptychs, comprised of poetical texts and, aphorisms layered with
photographic elements. It can be read forward to back, back to front, and
starting anywhere in the middle. Pages from the unbound book were exhibited and
sold in St. Louis galleries between 1999 and 2002. Other works from this series
include a Six Comforts “screen” assembly the size of a room, The Six Comforts as
a series of hand-pulled woodcuts, The Six Comforts Panels (assemblage of found
objects with encaustic) and finally culminating in a concept-album in
collaboration with several talented St. Louis musicians.</p>
<p>
On January 17<sup>th</sup>, 2014, Christopher Gustave was found dead in his
apartment of a overdose of anti-depressants. Within days of his passing,
hundreds of his friends and supporters organized and began gathering together
his works of art. A fundraising memorial was held at MAD Art Gallery in St.
Louis, with the purpose to raise money for his eight-year-old daughter, Sophia.
We are continuing that purpose in perpetuity with the initial release of this book
The Six Comforts, which will mark the completion of Gustave’s final, and
perhaps most challenging and important, work of art.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>This book embodies a spiritual quest against the backdrop of modern industrial oppression.</h3>
<p>The experience one has of reading the book is extraordinary. Gustave tears down megalithic conceptions foisted upon us by a vapid culture and replaces them with sharp, emancipating anti-slogans. While the punk-rock ideals inherent to Gustave’s practice keep everything on the edge, there is redemption on every page.</p>

<h3>Worum geht es hier eigentlich?</h3>
<p>Magische Zahlen (<em><i>mag</i></em>ical <i>numb</i>ers) faszinierten schon immer die Menschen. Durch die Kombination von mathematischen Formeln und Zahlenreihen entstehen die faszinierendsten Muster. bei mag numb kannst Du 5 verschiedene Motive aus Zahlen kaufen. Auf Wunsch lassen sich diese sogar noch individualisieren, so dass das Bild nur für Dich hergestellt wird.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Warum Zahlen?</h3>
<p>Zahlen sind neben den Buchstaben der Grundstein unserer Kommunikation. Wir rechnen, bezahlen, programmieren, ja wir nutzen sie sogar für Geheim- und Geisteswissenschaften (vgl. Numerologie). Zahlen bestimmen oft nur indirekt unser Leben. Geprägt werden wir von Emotionen und Entscheidungen, die wir an jedem einzelnen Tag treffen. Zahlen bilden dabei eine entscheidende Rolle: Ist das Produkt preiswerter? Wie viel Strom verbrauche ich? Wie lange dauert ein Waschvorgang? Auch in Unternehmen stellen die Zahlen die Basis dar, jedoch geraten sie mehr und mehr in den Hintergrund. Emotionen sind das neue Marketinginstrument von Unternehmen und doch ist der Geschäftsbericht mit den Kennzahlen das A und O.</p>
<p>Mag numb möchte deshalb die Bedeutung von Zahlen wieder hervorheben. Es zeigt in einzigartigen Kunstwerken stillvolle Muster die alle eins gemeinsam haben: Die Basis sind Zahlen. Erst bei genauerer Betrachtung werden diese deutlich.

</div></div>","Worum geht es hier eigentlich?
Magische Zahlen (magical numbers) faszinierten schon immer die Menschen. Durch die Kombination von mathematischen Formeln und Zahlenreihen entstehen die faszinierendsten Muster. bei mag numb kannst Du 5 verschiedene Motive aus Zahlen kaufen. Auf Wunsch lassen sich diese sogar noch individualisieren, so dass das Bild nur für Dich hergestellt wird.
 
Warum Zahlen?
Zahlen sind neben den Buchstaben der Grundstein unserer Kommunikation. Wir rechnen, bezahlen, programmieren, ja wir nutzen sie sogar für Geheim- und Geisteswissenschaften (vgl. Numerologie). Zahlen bestimmen oft nur indirekt unser Leben. Geprägt werden wir von Emotionen und Entscheidungen, die wir an jedem einzelnen Tag treffen. Zahlen bilden dabei eine entscheidende Rolle: Ist das Produkt preiswerter? Wie viel Strom verbrauche ich? Wie lange dauert ein Waschvorgang? Auch in Unternehmen stellen die Zahlen die Basis dar, jedoch geraten sie mehr und mehr in den Hintergrund. Emotionen sind das neue Marketinginstrument von Unternehmen und doch ist der Geschäftsbericht mit den Kennzahlen das A und O.
Mag numb möchte deshalb die Bedeutung von Zahlen wieder hervorheben. Es zeigt in einzigartigen Kunstwerken stillvolle Muster die alle eins gemeinsam haben: Die Basis sind Zahlen. Erst bei genauerer Betrachtung werden diese deutlich. Durch das Hervorheben von zwei Zahlen wird deutlich, dass, auch wenn die Zahlenwelt komplex und riesig erscheint, wir immer noch unseren Platz finden können.

<p>Miguel Amate, artista-pintor y creador de muñecas-esculturas.<br/><br/>Vivió más de treinta años en su taller-galería en el Marais de París, se libera del sitio para vagabundear como nómada por el macadam parisino con el fin de estar más cerca de la realidad humana y re-descubre el lado insólito y profundo de ella, así como en Mallorca donde pasa algunas temporadas.<br/><br/><br/>De origen catalán-mallorquín pero nacido en Cartagena, España, en 1944. De familia militar. Estudió en escuelas religiosas, comenzó a pintar a los siete años en esta ciudad, los paisajes áridos que le rodeaban, sus lugares predilectos de juego y creación.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Más tarde estudió arte en el taller de Don Vicente Ros y Alonso Luzzy. Una enseñanza que le da las bases de la pintura clásica y admiración por los grandes maestros españoles, como Velázquez, Goya, y Greco. Paralelamente a sus obras clásicas y violentas, realiza conjuntos de materiales diversos: maderas, cuerdas, tejidos, metales oxidados, objetos encontrados al azar en aquellas tierras quemadas por el sol donde una vez exorcizados fueron adoptados para formar parte de conjuntos artísticos con una otra función.<br/><br/><br/>En los años sesenta, calificado por sus maestros como “tremendista” y “brutal”, les abandona… abandona todo para recorrer Europa: en Suecia trabaja la escultura monumental en hierro forjado para el Centro Cultural de Estocolmo; en Alemania y Londres realiza dibujos y pinturas con una fuerte tendencia psicodélica; finalmente, en 1969 se instala en París fundando una familia que vive con él en el taller.<br/><br/><br/>Al principio de los años setenta, continúa sus cuadros relieves y muñecas-esculturas o esculturas-pinturas Grotescas y sexuales, en el silencio del sótano de su taller-galería-vivienda, donde convierte este espacio en el primer museo Artbrutal, siendo visitado asiduamente por un buen público entusiasta de esta obra insólita y en pleno corazón de París. Dándole a este barrio un empuje dinámico-creativo y razón de ser.<br/><br/><br/>El Artbrutal, nacido en este ghetto-ciénaga donde el tiempo se había parado y las instituciones royales hundidas en el pasado surgieron distintas y liberadas, dando origen a esta forma de arte, ahora es… - Le Marais! Aún sin el Artbrutal de Miguel Amate que la ciénaga acogió por varias decenas estéticas, palabras que Philippe Soupeau comentó en uno de esos encuentros casuales, en un París de encuentros y rupturas.<br/><br/>Todo lo que podamos recaudar será para financiar el proyecto, y en beneficio de una causa noble como es el arte. También con el propósito que sea una otra forma, Arte Terapia, donde el creador pueda expresarse libremente, y encontrarse así mismo a través del conocimiento de su yo profundo, que es la base de toda curación del espíritu. Creo que después este largo viaje iniciático, formas de buscar soluciones a mi estado de animo, es mi deber enseñar a otros  lo inefable.</p> <ul> <li>De una forma intuitiva, pienso en el financiamiento necesario para llevar a cabo  mi sueño, el de otros, y hasta donde nos llevará. Supongo que 250.000 € es una suma que para empezar será el comienzo de hacer realidad una operación con fines que se prolonguen hasta que el resultado sea satisfactorios para todos los embarcados en la aventura. Como digo en el proyecto, Palma de Mallorca es el lugar idóneo para tal realización, ya que es una ciudad que esta en pleno desarrollo, y no solamente turístico, sino artístico; este cambio me hace pensar un poco a los años que pase en La Marais de París, desde 1972-2005, y que con mi forma de expresión la zona dio todo un giro, para ser lo que ahora es. </li> <li>Todo esto me puso en un primer plano en el Arte parisino del pasado siglo, Con un pie dentro del arte contemporáneo, y otro fuera, es lo que fue mi más grande recompensa y libertad que es lo que nos corresponde. El haber expuesto en el Museo de Arte Moderno de París , así como en otros, y especialmente en el Centro Georges Pompidou; me catapultó a sentimientos muy personales, me hizo entender que mi duro trabajo no fue en vano, y que esa otra forma de arte que me había sacado de alguna parte de mi ser profundo podía servir a otros. Pienso, estoy ahora seguro, nada nuevo por cierto, que el Arte es un medio muy potente de seguir viviendo largamente y en buena salud, no entiendo como en la historia hubo tanta destrucción y desmadres de el. Es por eso que tengo plena confianza en mi actitud y los que entiendan mi posición, cuento con la ayuda de muchos, y que ella no será en vano.</li> <li>No pienso que no llegue a la meta que me he impuesto, ya que sea lo que obtenga será para lo mismo, aunque sea empezando por poco como ocurrió en aquellos principios (Circa70), en mi vieja panadería del Marais transformada en Taller-Galería-Museo. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3> </h3> <p>Esta campaña de obtener fondos para crear ese centro tan esperado, como ya he explicado anteriormente, es con fines no lucrativos. Tengo ya en vista varios lugares en Palma que serán ideales para la instalación, y estoy puramente cierto que no pasaría desapercibido, y que vuestra contribución tampoco, ya que toda persona o entidad oficial que nos aportara la ayuda no será en vano.  </p> <ul> <li>Bien seguro que mi proyecto es de un gran valor ya que en Palma no hay nada igual o que se le asemejara, pues esta es la principal idea e intención, que sea original e imposible de que otros medios la realicen ya que es en mi cabeza, y ella es única en mi género. Me gusta Mallorca porque en parte es la tierra de mis ancestros, y que es un enclave único en el mediterráneo, frecuentado a lo largo del año por la élite de muchos países, por el clima, la forma bella de vivir, pero necesita un algo más, que sea, también, más única.  </li> <li>Describe tu historial de éxito en proyectos como este (si lo tienes). </li> <li>Haz que la gente lo sienta real y genera confianza.

Tiene como objetivo principal, conseguir crear un museo donde recoger las obras de Miguel Amate, realizadas desde los años 60 hasta la actualidad.Constará de una parte permanente y otra en la cual el creador del movimiento “Art Brutal” realizará actividades eventualmente.La fundación también será un espacio de encuentro de artistas relacionados con esta forma de arte “ Art Brut o Brutal”. Por ello contará con una sala para la exposición de obras de artistas que siguen esta tendencia.Los artistas invitados a exponer en la fundación, serán alojados en ella, si es necesario, durante el periodo de la duración del evento. Todos los gastos serian a cargo de la fundación.Cabe destacar que la fundación acogerá al grupo de Newmotionart, para darle soporte y apoyar su interés por los nuevos creadores de identidad artística propia.Además de las exposiciones mensuales que realizará la fundación, constará de tres colecciones permanentes, que se irán formando de las donaciones que harán cada uno de los artistas que vengan a exponer.La colección de Miguel Amate y la de los seguidores de la corriente Art Brut constituirán el cuerpo del primer museo, y la colección de Newmotionart, si amplia sus fondos generará un museo con identidad propia e independiente.Las tres colecciones serán las siguientes:Colección Art Brutal, Miguel Amate:Recogerá toda la obra que haya sido posible reunir.Colección Art Brut (diversos artistas):Será constituida por obras de diversos artistas que siguen esta corriente.Colección Newmotionart:Comprendida por obras que irán donando los diversos artistas contemporáneosque irán exponiendo en la fundación. Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes. ¿POR QUÉ EN MALLORCA?Por ser un lugar geográficamente estratégico. Con un aeropuerto internacional, que sitúa a Mallorca cerca de importantes ciudades culturales europeas.Por su luz especial que brilla como un sueño hecho realidad, que invita a vivirlo.A vivir sus playas de arena fina, su mar de color absorbente, sus paisajes y pueblos que inmortalizan, su gastronomía tradicional, su historia multicultural con uno de los cascos góticos más extenso y mejor conservados de Europa, y un clima ideal para el disfrute de la misma.Por todo esto y mucho más Mallorca tiene algo misterioso, que gusta y no defrauda, tiene siempre algo que ofrecer, por eso atrae a un gran público de élite internacional.Fué visitada, desde lo más profundo de su historia, por los primeros pobladores, los honderos, pasando por Frederic Chopin y Georges Sand, Robert Graves, de Bram Van Der Velde fundador del grupo Cobra a Miró. Errol Flinn , John Cage, Milles Davis, Jimi Hendrix, Yoko Ono, Sting y el recientemente el creador de Freak Brother Gilbert Shelton, barón Von Thyssen-Bornemis, Sara Montiel al último rey de España donde pasa sus vacaciones cada año y a un muchos más personas de renombre.Por el futuro palacio de congresos que alzará a Palma como un nuevo destino competitivo de negocios.Esté nuevo emplazamiento potenciará la ciudad en si misma, atrayendo a un turismo urbano de alto poder adquisitivo y cultural, y no sujeto solamente a la temporada estival.También es de gran atractivo que el palacio sea de creación del importante arquitecto Francisco Mangado, siendo así, una de las construcciones simbólicas del mediterráneo, dando lugar a un referente arquitectónico de primera magnitud, motivo de visita obligada.Por sus prestigiosas actividades deportivas como las regatas de la copa del Rey, año tras año. Sus numerosos campos de golf y su naturaleza misma que se presta a infinidad de eventos deportivos.Todo ello crea un movimiento de turistas asiduos que visitan la isla. Una isla dotada de una selección de hoteles de renombre.Por ser un lugar abierto al mundo, deseamos mostrar en Mallorca otra forma de arte, arte vivo, centralizado en otras ciudades y que le daría un nueva dimensión a él y a esta ciudad.

Miguel Amate, artista-pintor y creador de muñecas-esculturas.Vivió más de treinta años en su taller-galería en el Marais de París, se libera del sitio para vagabundear como nómada por el macadam parisino con el fin de estar más cerca de la realidad humana y re-descubre el lado insólito y profundo de ella, así como en Mallorca donde pasa algunas temporadas.De origen catalán-mallorquín pero nacido en Cartagena, España, en 1944. De familia militar. Estudió en escuelas religiosas, comenzó a pintar a los siete años en esta ciudad, los paisajes áridos que le rodeaban, sus lugares predilectos de juego y creación.Más tarde estudió arte en el taller de Don Vicente Ros y Alonso Luzzy. Una enseñanza que le da las bases de la pintura clásica y admiración por los grandes maestros españoles, como Velázquez, Goya, y Greco. Paralelamente a sus obras clásicas y violentas, realiza conjuntos de materiales diversos: maderas, cuerdas, tejidos, metales oxidados, objetos encontrados al azar en aquellas tierras quemadas por el sol donde una vez exorcizados fueron adoptados para formar parte de conjuntos artísticos con una otra función.En los años sesenta, calificado por sus maestros como “tremendista” y “brutal”, les abandona… abandona todo para recorrer Europa: en Suecia trabaja la escultura monumental en hierro forjado para el Centro Cultural de Estocolmo; en Alemania y Londres realiza dibujos y pinturas con una fuerte tendencia psicodélica; finalmente, en 1969 se instala en París fundando una familia que vive con él en el taller.Al principio de los años setenta, continúa sus cuadros relieves y muñecas-esculturas o esculturas-pinturas Grotescas y sexuales, en el silencio del sótano de su taller-galería-vivienda, donde convierte este espacio en el primer museo Artbrutal, siendo visitado asiduamente por un buen público entusiasta de esta obra insólita y en pleno corazón de París. Dándole a este barrio un empuje dinámico-creativo y razón de ser.El Artbrutal, nacido en este ghetto-ciénaga donde el tiempo se había parado y las instituciones royales hundidas en el pasado surgieron distintas y liberadas, dando origen a esta forma de arte, ahora es… - Le Marais! Aún sin el Artbrutal de Miguel Amate que la ciénaga acogió por varias decenas estéticas, palabras que Philippe Soupeau comentó en uno de esos encuentros casuales, en un París de encuentros y rupturas.Todo lo que podamos recaudar será para financiar el proyecto, y en beneficio de una causa noble como es el arte. También con el propósito que sea una otra forma, Arte Terapia, donde el creador pueda expresarse libremente, y encontrarse así mismo a través del conocimiento de su yo profundo, que es la base de toda curación del espíritu. Creo que después este largo viaje iniciático, formas de buscar soluciones a mi estado de animo, es mi deber enseñar a otros  lo inefable.  De una forma intuitiva, pienso en el financiamiento necesario para llevar a cabo  mi sueño, el de otros, y hasta donde nos llevará. Supongo que 250.000 € es una suma que para empezar será el comienzo de hacer realidad una operación con fines que se prolonguen hasta que el resultado sea satisfactorios para todos los embarcados en la aventura. Como digo en el proyecto, Palma de Mallorca es el lugar idóneo para tal realización, ya que es una ciudad que esta en pleno desarrollo, y no solamente turístico, sino artístico; este cambio me hace pensar un poco a los años que pase en La Marais de París, desde 1972-2005, y que con mi forma de expresión la zona dio todo un giro, para ser lo que ahora es.  Todo esto me puso en un primer plano en el Arte parisino del pasado siglo, Con un pie dentro del arte contemporáneo, y otro fuera, es lo que fue mi más grande recompensa y libertad que es lo que nos corresponde. El haber expuesto en el Museo de Arte Moderno de París , así como en otros, y especialmente en el Centro Georges Pompidou; me catapultó a sentimientos muy personales, me hizo entender que mi duro trabajo no fue en vano, y que esa otra forma de arte que me había sacado de alguna parte de mi ser profundo podía servir a otros. Pienso, estoy ahora seguro, nada nuevo por cierto, que el Arte es un medio muy potente de seguir viviendo largamente y en buena salud, no entiendo como en la historia hubo tanta destrucción y desmadres de el. Es por eso que tengo plena confianza en mi actitud y los que entiendan mi posición, cuento con la ayuda de muchos, y que ella no será en vano. No pienso que no llegue a la meta que me he impuesto, ya que sea lo que obtenga será para lo mismo, aunque sea empezando por poco como ocurrió en aquellos principios (Circa70), en mi vieja panadería del Marais transformada en Taller-Galería-Museo.       Esta campaña de obtener fondos para crear ese centro tan esperado, como ya he explicado anteriormente, es con fines no lucrativos. Tengo ya en vista varios lugares en Palma que serán ideales para la instalación, y estoy puramente cierto que no pasaría desapercibido, y que vuestra contribución tampoco, ya que toda persona o entidad oficial que nos aportara la ayuda no será en vano.    Bien seguro que mi proyecto es de un gran valor ya que en Palma no hay nada igual o que se le asemejara, pues esta es la principal idea e intención, que sea original e imposible de que otros medios la realicen ya que es en mi cabeza, y ella es única en mi género. Me gusta Mallorca porque en parte es la tierra de mis ancestros, y que es un enclave único en el mediterráneo, frecuentado a lo largo del año por la élite de muchos países, por el clima, la forma bella de vivir, pero necesita un algo más, que sea, también, más única.   Describe tu historial de éxito en proyectos como este (si lo tienes).  Haz que la gente lo sienta real y genera confianza. Yo estaré siempre presente a vuestro lado y espero vosotros en el mio.      Ante todo no pienso correr ningún riesgo ni obstáculos, pues los compromisos para mi son sagrados como mi arte. Los fondos serán administrados a raja tabla, puntualizando cada movimiento de ellos que se hagan, esto siempre fue mi lema, y no entiendo de otras formas ni lucros, estamos en este planeta, un cierto tiempo, para una misión, y hay que cumplir con ella, Yo ya supe desde un principio de que lado me situaba y nunca trate de aprovecharme de lo que fuera, solo pretendí , con pasión, hacer mi Arte. Mi vida siempre ha sido un desafío e ir sorteando los riesgos y cuidarme de mi familia, hijos y amigos, ya que siempre he sido muy fiel a ella y a ellos. Así que de esta forma me conozco valoro y espero que valoréis mi intención.     Los obstáculos siempre los he superado estando presente, soy especialmente apto para ello, siendo siempre yo mismo.   Claro que un proyecto no se hace solo, se necesitan colaboradores y de esto no me faltan, tengo amigos muy cerca y fieles  a la causa ya que son verdaderos artistas, con una única y verdadera ambición, el arte. Sin embargo soy abierto a nuevos amigos que deseen participar en el.      Algunas personas no pueden colaborar, pero eso no significa que no puedan ayudar:   Todo el que se sienta identificado y que el proyecto le parezca de su interés, les pido me ayuden a difundirlo, esta colaboración sera de lo más preciosa para mi y los que me  sigan Podéis utilizar las herramientas de Indiegogo. Esto facilitara aún más el tiempo de la realización del proyecto ya que el tiempo corre.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
