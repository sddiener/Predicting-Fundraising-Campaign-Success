<p>This is a platonic love story.</p>

<p>The stakes in this love story are financial - can our quirky indie hero raise £1200 to pay for flights and travel expenses? Will money triumph over oceanic distances? <em>Will love win out?</em></p>
<p>If so, I'll be flying out of San Francisco on October 9th, and flying back October 23rd. This is a super convenient trip itinerary, as I'm scheduled to be at a convention in the San Francisco area on either side of those flights. My time in England would be dedicated to visiting with you, my dear geeky weirdo poet gamer friends.</p>
<p>I can make no guarantees about my time, or your access to it. Here's what I can say: if this funds, I'll be in England from October 9-23. I'll spend much of my time in London, maybe all of it. I'll invite you all to join me at events we pull together: pub nights, game nights, picnics in parks regardless how chilly, a brunch.</p>

Conservation needs to be decolonized, and by managing and understanding their environment better than anyone else, indigenous people have proven to be the best conservationists. As the JoGo was inspired by the Yerba Mate straws created by the Guaraní tribe, a partner of Survival International, we believe it is our duty, and privilege, to give back to this nation.Our annual contribution will be in the form of unrestricted funds so that Survival International, and their tribal partners, can allocate resources in response to real-time needs. As we are located in Minnesota, we are not equipped to understand or address the complex social, political, and environmental issues in these regions. And we believe that the people who can best resolve them are the ones who are being the most affected by them.To find out more information about Survival International, visit their website: https://www.survivalinternational.orgWe would like to sincerely thank the countless people who have helped us on this journey. We could not have gotten this far without the devotion of our advisors, friends, family, team of content creators, and all of you! Each of you has helped make our dream a reality and we have the deepest appreciation for all of your support.  For press and retail inquiries please reach us at hello@jogostraw.com",36.0,1,"1 Campaign

</h3><p><strong>About Us</strong></p><p>Growing up in a transient environment pushed Eoin to constantly adapt to different environments and embrace a nomadic lifestyle. Throughout a 12 year career developing premium lifestyle brands and constantly traveling he realised that there was a gap in the market, for a power solution that would allow him to work on the go anywhere in the world and stay connected.. He decided to leave behind everything he knew to solve this problem for everyone and ARROE was born. He brought together a team of experts who shared his vision and they set to work inventing LAER, the worlds first universal charging solution, specifically designed for luggage and bags. Allowing you to free yourself from the wall socket.</p><p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p><p>ARROE exists to free you from the wall socket by creating an ecosystem of technology products that allow you to stay in charge all day every day. Our aim is to make our revolutionary technology available to anyone that wants to enjoy the freedom that we do and stay connected in a digital world.</p><div style=""text-align: center;margin:0 auto 15px;""><p> </p></div><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>FAQ</strong></h2><p><strong>Will my laptop fit in the LAER Sleeve?</strong></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Maximum laptop dimensions are 38x26x3cm or 15x10.2x1.18 inches. This covers most 15"" laptops and smaller. If in doubt please ask us (support@arroe.co)</span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It is important to note that for your laptop to charge inside the sleeve the laptop charging port must be on the side, not on the back. If your laptop charging port is on the back you can still charge it outside the sleeve. </span></p><p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>What are the laptop connectors?</strong></p><p>The laptop connectors allow you to connect LAER to your laptop and charge it.</p><p><strong>Which connectors should I choose?</strong></p><p>We send you a backer survey after you back us to ensure you are getting the right connector for your laptop.</p><p><strong>What is the Warranty?</strong></p><p>ARROE offers standard one year international warranty. We guarantee you receive your LAER free of manufacturing defects.</p><p><strong>Do you ship to my country? How much will shipping cost?</strong></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">USA - $15 ($30 for 2x pack)</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">EU - $15 ($30 for 2x pack)</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Rest of World - $30 ($60 for 2x pack)</p><p><strong>How will my order be shipped?</strong></p><p>We will be shipping with an International courier. Each shipment will receive a tracking number which will be emailed to you once the delivery has been shipped from our distribution centre.</p><p><strong>Are there any taxes associated to my order?</strong></p><p>Orders may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees according to the country of destination. Such import taxes, customs duties and fees can vary from one country to another. Additional charges for customs clearance must be fulfilled by the recipient upon reception. ARROE has no control over these charges.</p><p><strong>What is your refund policy?</strong></p><p>ARROE complies with <a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526876-Refunds-Can-I-get-my-money-back-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Indiegogo refund policy</a>. Refunds that are not eligible, according to Indiegogo policy guidelines, are processed based on the team's internal guidelines and off platform. Please bear in mind that all refunds will be locked at some point in order to go into production and shipment. We will not be able to refund any order once they've shipped.</p><p><strong>When is LAER expected to ship?</strong></p><p>LAER is expected to start shipping in December 2019. As soon as we ship you will receive a tracking number to tell you when you should expect delivery.</p><p><strong>Why should I wait longer than usual?</strong></p><p>Indiegogo is not a pre-ordering platform. Instead, you're helping to build a product and bring the project to life, which may take more time than products already available on the market.</p><p><strong>Do the LAER Sleeves and Slings exist in different sizes?</strong></p><p>Yes, after you back us we will send you a backer survey so you can select the size you need. </p><p><strong>Why would I buy LAER instead of a power bank?</strong></p><p>• LAER is remotely controlled via app, Power banks are manually controlled </p><p>• LAER is one less thing to charge, Power banks are one more thing to charge</p><p>• LAER allows you to switch battery capacities, Power banks don't</p><p>• LAER charges DC and USB C, Power banks don't</p><p>• LAER charges MagSafe, most Power banks don’t </p><p>• LAER has location tracking, Power banks don’t </p><p><strong>What is USB PD?</strong></p><p>USB Power Delivery is a charging technology. It uses USB-C cables and connectors to deliver higher levels of power to your devices. This has two benefits: one, faster charging, and two, more power for larger devices.</p><p><strong>How does Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 work?</strong></p><p>With Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0, your device battery can charge from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes or less (may vary depending on charging equipment and power source). After surpassing 50% charge, the charging speed slows down slightly to prevent over-stressing the battery.</p><p>Can I plug my OnePlus phone into Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 even though it does not use the same fast-charging technology?</p><p>OnePlus 3 is using Dash Charge speed and not Qualcomm Quick Charge. As we adopted Quick Charge 3.0, plugging it into the LAER Quickcharge port will offer you the charging speed of Quickcharge but not Dash Charge.</p><p><strong>What is Wireless Charging?</strong></p><p>Wireless charging works on electromagnetic fields transferring power from a transmitting source to a receiving device in order to charge a battery without using a physical cable. For wireless charging to work two induction coils are required: one on your phone, linked to the battery and another one in the charging pad. This last powered coil will create an electromagnetic field around itself, and when the induction coil of your phone gets close enough, your phone will be able to harvest electric current from the induction coil.</p><p><strong>How close do I need to place my device in order to charge it wirelessly?</strong></p><p>Just like most single coil induction chargers, LAER Qi chargers only operate over a short distance e.g. physical contact between the device and the pads.</p><p><strong>Can the Universal Wireless Charging Receiver Card work with any device? With any smartphone case?</strong></p><p>Universal Wireless charging receiver card can be used with most non-metallic cases and under 2mm thick. Please note that hard cases, cards and other objects place in between the charging receiver card and the case may block the signal, thus we recommend using soft cases and/or avoid any object placed in between for an optimal charging.</p><p><strong>How do I know if my smartphone supports wireless charging?</strong></p><p>Here are popular smartphones supporting wireless charging:</p><p>APPLE - iPhone 8, iPhone X</p><p>SAMSUNG - GALAXY S8+/S8/S7 EDGE/S7/S6 EDGE+/S6 EDGE/S6, NOTE 5/7</p><p>GOOGLE - NEXUS 4/5/6/7</p><p>LUMIA - 735/830/928/930/1520/920/950XL/950/1020/929</p><p>HTC - 8X, DROID DNA, THUNDERBOLD</p><p>ASUS - PADFONE S</p><p>BLACKBERRY - Z30, CLASSIC, PRIV</p><p>LG - OPTIMUS G PRO, G4/G3/G6</p><p>MOTOROLA - DROID MAX/MINI/TURBO</p><p>SONY - XPERIA Z3V/Z4V</p><p>For smartphones that do not support Qi charging natively, we offer Universal Wireless charging receiver cards for $15 which connect to the phone’s charging port and sit between your phone and your phone case. The Wireless charging receiver cards work with both iPhone and Android and will be shipped with your LAER sleeve.</p><p>For more information about Qi, check out <a href=""http://www.qiwireless.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.qiwireless.com</a> for a detailed view on wireless enabled devices.</p><p><strong>Can I charge my device even if my device is not Quick charge 3.0 enabled?</strong></p><p>Yes. It will charge at regular USB 3 speed.</p><p><strong>How can I know if LAER is charged?</strong></p><p>You can view/manage charging levels with the ARROE mobile application which is available for iOS and Android.</p><p><strong>Does the ARROE app work with my phone?</strong></p><p>Currently the app works on iOS and Android but we may add other mobile operating systems depending on demand.</p><p><strong>What is the battery life of the LAER batteries?</strong></p><p>LAER comes with a battery management system that actively manages the health and life cycle of the Lithium-ion polymer cells. Under ideal circumstances, if used every day the battery will last about two years.</p><p><strong>Can I fly with LAER?</strong></p><p>Yes. FAA limits battery capacity to 27,000mAh. As LAER capacity is 20,000mAh, you can keep it in your carry-on luggage. LAER is safe for flying.</p><p><strong>How many devices can I charge at once?</strong></p><p>You can charge at least 3 devices at once. If you connect more devices they will then charge slower. This will not damage the battery but take longer to charge and drain LAER battery faster.</p><p><strong>How can I charge LAER battery?</strong></p><p>The battery has to be inside LAER to be charged. You can charge LAER with the included USB C power adapter or with a USB C laptop adapter if you have one.</p><p><strong>How long does it take to charge the LAER battery?</strong></p><p>The 20,000mAh battery takes less than 2 hours to charge.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>UPDATES</strong></u></p><p><strong><u>We're Shipping! - 20 Nov 2020</u></strong></p><p>We are now shipping small batch units to backers!</p><p>Batch 1 will receive the LAER hardware separate from the laptop sleeve and sling. The LAER hardware that they will receive first includes the LAER smart charging system and full accessories kit (USB-C PD 3.0 charger, USB-C PD 3.0 cables, international country plug tips, laptop connectors, extender cable). We will notify backers as soon as they are included in each future batch and before we send the shipment so we can also include tracking. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607709858/d4ym4xszmaohnsrghmla.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>LAER hardware and battery casing</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607709934/r3v5gpblvaxdbnp7amqz.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>LAER hardware PCBA</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607709998/ygxzaqiiko1sw79riz8l.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>USB-C PD 3.0 60W charger assembly</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607710019/wnxpnh8xmfzrf4hzagcs.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>USB-C PD 3.0 60W chargers assembled</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607710123/n0sti7dyzeesy8pxdhku.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>PC laptop connectors</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607710157/htxh1supbdq2t15pj9lq.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>LAER hardware packaging</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607710186/ggjypz0jrk3yedlxqywt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Cartons containing LAER hardware packaging</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><strong><u>Tooling Has Begun - 7 Oct 2019</u></strong></p><p>Tooling began on 7th October with our manufacturing partners in Shenzhen.

When charging your devices at night. You can charge all of them via LAER from one socket. You don’t need to worry about plugging in multiple devices and power banks separately. 

When working remotely. Use LAER to charge all your devices. Plane, train, coffee shop etc. 

In between meetings. Charge your devices inside your bag while on the move. 

In the morning when you are heading out you just grab LAER with the laptop already inside and charged along with the built in battery.

   Meet the team
About UsGrowing up in a transient environment pushed Eoin to constantly adapt to different environments and embrace a nomadic lifestyle. Throughout a 12 year career developing premium lifestyle brands and constantly traveling he realised that there was a gap in the market, for a power solution that would allow him to work on the go anywhere in the world and stay connected.. He decided to leave behind everything he knew to solve this problem for everyone and ARROE was born. He brought together a team of experts who shared his vision and they set to work inventing LAER, the worlds first universal charging solution, specifically designed for luggage and bags. Allowing you to free yourself from the wall socket.Our MissionARROE exists to free you from the wall socket by creating an ecosystem of technology products that allow you to stay in charge all day every day. Our aim is to make our revolutionary technology available to anyone that wants to enjoy the freedom that we do and stay connected in a digital world. FAQWill my laptop fit in the LAER Sleeve?Maximum laptop dimensions are 38x26x3cm or 15x10.2x1.18 inches. This covers most 15"" laptops and smaller. If in doubt please ask us (support@arroe.co)It is important to note that for your laptop to charge inside the sleeve the laptop charging port must be on the side, not on the back. If your laptop charging port is on the back you can still charge it outside the sleeve. What are the laptop connectors?The laptop connectors allow you to connect LAER to your laptop and charge it.Which connectors should I choose?We send you a backer survey after you back us to ensure you are getting the right connector for your laptop.What is the Warranty?ARROE offers standard one year international warranty. We guarantee you receive your LAER free of manufacturing defects.Do you ship to my country? How much will shipping cost?USA - $15 ($30 for 2x pack)EU - $15 ($30 for 2x pack)Rest of World - $30 ($60 for 2x pack)How will my order be shipped?We will be shipping with an International courier. Each shipment will receive a tracking number which will be emailed to you once the delivery has been shipped from our distribution centre.Are there any taxes associated to my order?Orders may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees according to the country of destination. Such import taxes, customs duties and fees can vary from one country to another. Additional charges for customs clearance must be fulfilled by the recipient upon reception. ARROE has no control over these charges.What is your refund policy?ARROE complies with Indiegogo refund policy. Refunds that are not eligible, according to Indiegogo policy guidelines, are processed based on the team's internal guidelines and off platform. Please bear in mind that all refunds will be locked at some point in order to go into production and shipment. We will not be able to refund any order once they've shipped.When is LAER expected to ship?LAER is expected to start shipping in December 2019. As soon as we ship you will receive a tracking number to tell you when you should expect delivery.Why should I wait longer than usual?Indiegogo is not a pre-ordering platform. Instead, you're helping to build a product and bring the project to life, which may take more time than products already available on the market.Do the LAER Sleeves and Slings exist in different sizes?Yes, after you back us we will send you a backer survey so you can select the size you need. Why would I buy LAER instead of a power bank?• LAER is remotely controlled via app, Power banks are manually controlled • LAER is one less thing to charge, Power banks are one more thing to charge• LAER allows you to switch battery capacities, Power banks don't• LAER charges DC and USB C, Power banks don't• LAER charges MagSafe, most Power banks don’t • LAER has location tracking, Power banks don’t What is USB PD?USB Power Delivery is a charging technology. It uses USB-C cables and connectors to deliver higher levels of power to your devices. This has two benefits: one, faster charging, and two, more power for larger devices.How does Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 work?With Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0, your device battery can charge from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes or less (may vary depending on charging equipment and power source). After surpassing 50% charge, the charging speed slows down slightly to prevent over-stressing the battery.Can I plug my OnePlus phone into Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 even though it does not use the same fast-charging technology?OnePlus 3 is using Dash Charge speed and not Qualcomm Quick Charge. As we adopted Quick Charge 3.0, plugging it into the LAER Quickcharge port will offer you the charging speed of Quickcharge but not Dash Charge.What is Wireless Charging?Wireless charging works on electromagnetic fields transferring power from a transmitting source to a receiving device in order to charge a battery without using a physical cable. For wireless charging to work two induction coils are required: one on your phone, linked to the battery and another one in the charging pad. This last powered coil will create an electromagnetic field around itself, and when the induction coil of your phone gets close enough, your phone will be able to harvest electric current from the induction coil.How close do I need to place my device in order to charge it wirelessly?Just like most single coil induction chargers, LAER Qi chargers only operate over a short distance e.g. physical contact between the device and the pads.Can the Universal Wireless Charging Receiver Card work with any device? With any smartphone case?Universal Wireless charging receiver card can be used with most non-metallic cases and under 2mm thick. Please note that hard cases, cards and other objects place in between the charging receiver card and the case may block the signal, thus we recommend using soft cases and/or avoid any object placed in between for an optimal charging.How do I know if my smartphone supports wireless charging?Here are popular smartphones supporting wireless charging:APPLE - iPhone 8, iPhone XSAMSUNG - GALAXY S8+/S8/S7 EDGE/S7/S6 EDGE+/S6 EDGE/S6, NOTE 5/7GOOGLE - NEXUS 4/5/6/7LUMIA - 735/830/928/930/1520/920/950XL/950/1020/929HTC - 8X, DROID DNA, THUNDERBOLDASUS - PADFONE SBLACKBERRY - Z30, CLASSIC, PRIVLG - OPTIMUS G PRO, G4/G3/G6MOTOROLA - DROID MAX/MINI/TURBOSONY - XPERIA Z3V/Z4VFor smartphones that do not support Qi charging natively, we offer Universal Wireless charging receiver cards for $15 which connect to the phone’s charging port and sit between your phone and your phone case. The Wireless charging receiver cards work with both iPhone and Android and will be shipped with your LAER sleeve.For more information about Qi, check out http://www.qiwireless.com for a detailed view on wireless enabled devices.Can I charge my device even if my device is not Quick charge 3.0 enabled?Yes. It will charge at regular USB 3 speed.How can I know if LAER is charged?You can view/manage charging levels with the ARROE mobile application which is available for iOS and Android.Does the ARROE app work with my phone?Currently the app works on iOS and Android but we may add other mobile operating systems depending on demand.What is the battery life of the LAER batteries?LAER comes with a battery management system that actively manages the health and life cycle of the Lithium-ion polymer cells. Under ideal circumstances, if used every day the battery will last about two years.Can I fly with LAER?Yes. FAA limits battery capacity to 27,000mAh. As LAER capacity is 20,000mAh, you can keep it in your carry-on luggage. LAER is safe for flying.How many devices can I charge at once?You can charge at least 3 devices at once. If you connect more devices they will then charge slower. This will not damage the battery but take longer to charge and drain LAER battery faster.How can I charge LAER battery?The battery has to be inside LAER to be charged. You can charge LAER with the included USB C power adapter or with a USB C laptop adapter if you have one.How long does it take to charge the LAER battery?The 20,000mAh battery takes less than 2 hours to charge. UPDATESWe're Shipping! - 20 Nov 2020We are now shipping small batch units to backers!Batch 1 will receive the LAER hardware separate from the laptop sleeve and sling.

<h3>Come See Us in Playa Malibu, Panama!</h3>
<p>For the past two years, Pelican's Surf Club has operated as a gathering place and beach bar in Panama, welcoming a vibrant, inclusive mix of both local Panamanians and international tourists. We're excited to announce that we have an opportunity to open a permanent location and expand this community to the Pacific Coast!</p>
<p>The Club is located at Playa Malibu, Gorgona, which is a popular surfing destination on the Pacific Coast, about 90 minutes from Panama City. The Club's gate opens right onto the white and black volcanic sand of the beach. It also has a small pool, an open area for gathering, a space for an on-site restaurant, and available for overnight rentals. </p>
<p>For our friends in Panama City, the Club is perfectly located for a day trip to the beach or a weekend getaway. For international tourists, the Club can provide a place to stay and connect with a vibrant community of fellow travelers, for both relaxing days on the sand or by the pool and fully planned day trips to help you explore some of Panama's other local attractions like the Canal, the rainforest, or Panama's Old City. </p>
<p>Our vision for the club is a ""micro-hotel"": All of the amenities you would expect from a hotel (restaurant meals, a pool, towel service, access to kayaks and paddle boards, and complete coordination of transportation and local day trips), but with the welcoming, personal and inclusive vibe of a bed and breakfast or hostel. Yami is a graduate of Cordon Bleu culinary school and has both restaurant and private cheffing experience that she'll draw upon as she crafts fusion meals that  celebrate Panamanian cuisine. </p>
<p>Pelican's Surf Club is a place for both Panamanians and international tourists to come together to celebrate the natural beauty of Panama. Investing in Pelican's Surf Club means joining this vibrant community! </p>
<h3> </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622584015/c77te7shxxpub85evahi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>A Beach Club for Everyone</h3>
<p>For those of you that know us personally, you know that Yami has been dedicated to growing the community of Pelican's Surf Club for the past three years, even running a virtual version during quarantine with drink delivery and zoom hang-outs! Yami grew up in Panama City, spending summers on the Atlantic coast and learning about the Panamanian tourism industry firsthand from her family, who own a small hotel on an island there. She came to the US for college and has lived here for the past 25 years. While in the US, enjoying the beaches here, she was struck by a growing realization: ordinary Panamanians, unlike most US citizens, do not generally have access to the wealth of beautiful natural resources in their own country. Beaches in Panama are increasingly privatized, and only accessible to families who can own or rent a beach house. This led Yami to the idea to start a ""Beach Club,"" where guests could visit for the day, the weekend, or the week, and have access to both the beach and the amenities - showers, bathrooms, beach umbrellas, a small restaurant - that make a day at the ocean enjoyable and relaxing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619969041/ejuwf2rxrlktyqscx7mn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>It's rare, in Panama, to see an Afro-Latinx, queer woman running her own business.</strong> We're proud to say that the little community we have created at Pelican's Surf Club is a welcoming place for everyone: Panamanians, tourists, the LGBT community, and many different kinds of families. Supporting our Club means also supporting the creation and expansion of this welcoming, joyful space. </p>

<h3>Responsible Vacationing </h3>
<p>Pelican's Surf Club will follow all local guidelines to prevent the transmission of coronavirus. For now, that means limiting the number of guests and making sure that we follow social distancing rules in all gathering spaces. The Club will offer private transportation from the airport for all of our guests, as well as private transportation for any day trips. We believe that our Club, with its open air gathering spaces and fully private rental units, including private porches, offers vaccinated travelers a safe way to visit Panama. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Becoming Part of the Pelican's Surf Club Community</h3>
<p>Contributing to this campaign means that you have reserved an all-inclusive rental at the Club. This includes three meals a day, drinks, access to all Club amenities, and transportation from the airport and to local day trips. </p>
<p>This booking will never expire. Use it whenever you can. We have high expectations that the Club will be in successful operation for years, but if for some reason you aren't able to redeem your visit, we will extend a full refund. </p>

For the past two years, Pelican's Surf Club has operated as a gathering place and beach bar in Panama, welcoming a vibrant, inclusive mix of both local Panamanians and international tourists. We're excited to announce that we have an opportunity to open a permanent location and expand this community to the Pacific Coast!
The Club is located at Playa Malibu, Gorgona, which is a popular surfing destination on the Pacific Coast, about 90 minutes from Panama City. The Club's gate opens right onto the white and black volcanic sand of the beach. It also has a small pool, an open area for gathering, a space for an on-site restaurant, and available for overnight rentals. 
For our friends in Panama City, the Club is perfectly located for a day trip to the beach or a weekend getaway. For international tourists, the Club can provide a place to stay and connect with a vibrant community of fellow travelers, for both relaxing days on the sand or by the pool and fully planned day trips to help you explore some of Panama's other local attractions like the Canal, the rainforest, or Panama's Old City. 
Our vision for the club is a ""micro-hotel"": All of the amenities you would expect from a hotel (restaurant meals, a pool, towel service, access to kayaks and paddle boards, and complete coordination of transportation and local day trips), but with the welcoming, personal and inclusive vibe of a bed and breakfast or hostel. Yami is a graduate of Cordon Bleu culinary school and has both restaurant and private cheffing experience that she'll draw upon as she crafts fusion meals that  celebrate Panamanian cuisine. 
Pelican's Surf Club is a place for both Panamanians and international tourists to come together to celebrate the natural beauty of Panama. Investing in Pelican's Surf Club means joining this vibrant community! 
 

 
A Beach Club for Everyone
For those of you that know us personally, you know that Yami has been dedicated to growing the community of Pelican's Surf Club for the past three years, even running a virtual version during quarantine with drink delivery and zoom hang-outs! Yami grew up in Panama City, spending summers on the Atlantic coast and learning about the Panamanian tourism industry firsthand from her family, who own a small hotel on an island there. She came to the US for college and has lived here for the past 25 years. While in the US, enjoying the beaches here, she was struck by a growing realization: ordinary Panamanians, unlike most US citizens, do not generally have access to the wealth of beautiful natural resources in their own country. Beaches in Panama are increasingly privatized, and only accessible to families who can own or rent a beach house. This led Yami to the idea to start a ""Beach Club,"" where guests could visit for the day, the weekend, or the week, and have access to both the beach and the amenities - showers, bathrooms, beach umbrellas, a small restaurant - that make a day at the ocean enjoyable and relaxing.

It's rare, in Panama, to see an Afro-Latinx, queer woman running her own business. We're proud to say that the little community we have created at Pelican's Surf Club is a welcoming place for everyone: Panamanians, tourists, the LGBT community, and many different kinds of families. Supporting our Club means also supporting the creation and expansion of this welcoming, joyful space. 

 
Responsible Vacationing 
Pelican's Surf Club will follow all local guidelines to prevent the transmission of coronavirus. For now, that means limiting the number of guests and making sure that we follow social distancing rules in all gathering spaces. The Club will offer private transportation from the airport for all of our guests, as well as private transportation for any day trips. We believe that our Club, with its open air gathering spaces and fully private rental units, including private porches, offers vaccinated travelers a safe way to visit Panama. 
 
Becoming Part of the Pelican's Surf Club Community
Contributing to this campaign means that you have reserved an all-inclusive rental at the Club. This includes three meals a day, drinks, access to all Club amenities, and transportation from the airport and to local day trips. 
This booking will never expire. Use it whenever you can. We have high expectations that the Club will be in successful operation for years, but if for some reason you aren't able to redeem your visit, we will extend a full refund. 
Participating in this pre-sale will help us negotiate for more ownership as we work with our investors, and will help us fund the wide variety of costs that come with a start-up venture like this.

After two successful Kickstarter campaigns and thousands of satisfied customers, we’re back with a customer-requested follow-up for sustainable pants that do it all.EcoTrek Trail Pants are fully-synthetic tech pants made with 70% recycled ocean waste and a modern, tailored fit. They’re so versatile you can replace jeans, slacks, and outdoor pants with one pair of EcoTreks without compromising on style, functionality, or comfort.Plus, the lifetime warranty ensures they withstand all your adventures or you get a new pair or at-cost repair.With 3 colors to choose from - Olive, Charcoal, and Caramel - there's an option for everyone.At LIVSN, our mission is to empower you to own less and live more. We want you to experience all this world has to offer—while respecting nature. As our company has grown, so has our sustainability initiative.We’ve successfully launched 2 pairs of technical pants on Kickstarter and we’re back with our most innovative and sustainable pants yet.Our customers asked for fully synthetic pants that can go on extended hikes in both wet and cold conditions - so we got to work!After a long search, we found a material that can withstand the elements, keep you comfortable, and look amazing while carrying all the technical features you need. EcoTrek Trail Pants are made from Blue Ocean Nylon, a durable fabric that’s lightweight and breathable, and withstands cold, hot, and wet conditions.Our EcoTrek Trail Pants are even more comfortable and versatile than our previous line of pants and we’ve sent them to REAL people to prove it:Blue Ocean Nylon is a synthetic, nylon thread that’s made from 70% ocean waste (specifically old buoys). The used or discarded buoys are recycled locally in Taiwan, which reduces the carbon footprint in the transportation of raw material. Plus, it’s applying for the Global Recycled Standard certificate!The material that makes our pants sustainable is also what makes them so exceptional.Your pants aren’t just sustainable and built to last, they’re backed by our Fair Deal Guarantee. We keep all LIVSN pants out of the landfill with our courteous warranty and replacement programs.THE FITEcoTrek Trail Pants fit well on most body types. They’re tailored slim, but definitely not like Portland skinny jeans. They fit well on an athletic build and scale appropriately as the sizing grows, giving room for bigger builds. Sizes top out at 38x34 in waist/inseam. We also designed the roll-up system to be hemmable without any loss of function.THE FUNCTIONYour favorite technical features like roll-up cuffs, zippered pockets, water/stain resistance, quick-drying, and breathability are all incorporated into what looks like your most stylish pair of slacks. These pants aren’t baggy or pocket heavy—they’re ridiculously stylish technical pants with higher abrasion resistance and less odor accumulation than comparable polyester fabrics.\EcoTreks have strong reinforcements at all common failure points. The back pockets, front pockets, seams, and hardware are all reinforced to last as long as possible. Use and abuse them—they can take it.EcoTrek Trail Pants are as comfortable as your favorite pair of sweats. The lightweight, breathable material makes them pleasant in even the hottest conditions and the relaxed fit makes them comfortable to wear with long underwear in the winter.You never know what you’ll face when you’re hiking or camping out, and that’s why it’s important to have protective pants that can withstand the elements. Rain, snow, rocks, and dust—EcoTreks can handle it all while giving you convenient technical features.Our top customers are climbers for a reason—we design climbing pants that, well, look way better than climbing pants.You’ll love EcoTreks for travel because of their low maintenance and high-end comfort.
Ultimate comfort when you’re in the car for days or on a plane for hours
Low maintenance means you can wash them in the sink
Lightweight & versatile means you have more room for souvenirs in your luggage
No need for suffocating lycra in yet another pair of skin-tight cycling pants. Slip into EcoTreks for your daily commute or long-distance trek. The roll-up cuff system with 3M reflective tape keeps your pant legs out of your chain, and the gusseted crotch and articulated knee design ensure there are no rips, discomfort, or unflattering stretched out knees.With abrasion resistance, an EDC pocket, and a zippered phone pocket-EcoTreks make a perfect pair of fishing pants. Hop into a boat or put your waders on over them, you’ll look good, feel good, and have easy access to all your essentials.EcoTrek Trail Pants pair perfectly with a button-down for a night on the town, dinner date, or coffee shop meeting.If business casual is your attire, EcoTreks will be your new favorite work pants. No one will look twice when you saunter into work wearing your favorite weekend adventure pants.Our mission is to build durable and versatile outdoor clothing that encourages people to wear it more, keep it longer, and spend more time outdoors.With 83% of clothing ending up in landfills or incinerators, we're not out to make products ""just because” or add to the clutter of apparel waste. Instead, we make long-lasting clothing that can be worn in multiple use-cases while utilizing environmentally-friendly materials!When you buy LIVSN products, you can feel good about where you’re spending your money and what you’re putting on your body—and that’s never been more true than with our EcoTrek Trail Pants.We will have stock for exchanges if you need to order a different size after delivery.New to Indiegogo? No problem. Follow these simple steps to get your own EcoTrek Trail Pants.At the end of the campaign, we’ll send you a survey to get your color, size, and shipping information, and deliver your EcoTrek Trail Pants when manufacturing is complete! We’ve delivered on all our previous products and communicate to you every step of the way!You can feel comfortable knowing we are backed by Techstars, ""the worldwide network that helps entrepreneurs succeed."" Our experience going through the Austin '19 accelerator program gives us the tools and guidance we need to be a strong company for years to come.The name LIVSN comes from the Swedish word ""livsnjutare,"" which roughly translates to ""one who lives life deeply; an enjoyer of life."" This journey started with a mission to simplify our belongings. With less to manage there's more time in the day, and with more time comes flexibility. We know we won't regret more time outside with friends and family.We believe clothing should perform well, look good, be ethically made, be environmentally friendly - and it should last. We want to own fewer, well-built things, and repair them before replacing them.We make good clothing, we make it with tried and true methods, and we make it with high-quality fabrics.DURABILITY & REPAIRABILITYOne of our main beliefs at LIVSN is that a product that performs well and stands up to extended use is as sustainable as it gets. By buying once and with intention, we're able to consume less. We're designing our products so that when life happens and they inevitably fail, they can be repaired.STYLE AND DYNAMIC USEOur way of approaching sustainable style is to use classic silhouettes, refined and tested materials, and clean, modern fits. We want you as the wearer to feel special, but not to call attention to it. What we want is for you to be able to wear LIVSN clothing to the trail, to the pub, or to the (casual) office and not look out of place. When we use technical fabrics and construction, we work to hide those details in a casual look.FABRIC SELECTIONWe choose our fabrics because they were the best available for the job, trying to source organic and recycled when we can. Some pieces here don't utilize recycled or organic materials because we aren't able to hit the scale needed, but we promise we will switch to recycled and organic as soon as we're able.THE END RESULTWe hope to come out in the end with something unique, but also familiar. A refined collection dedicated to the highest standards of craftsmanship and mindfulness. We hope you share our values and will help us in our journey to keep what matters.Andrew Gibbs-Dabney is the founder and CEO of LIVSN Designs, an outdoor brand focused on making versatile apparel designed to last longer.

<p>Hi Tragl Backers!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We have been working hard over the last months to bring you a device you will love to use! So we are really excited to share the new improved design with you!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In the video, Alex is wearing a prototype in a use test. The shorter arm is more compact and is better balanced. This format has also allowed us to better incorporate a resonance chamber to amplify the speaker. As you can hear in the video, the volume is perfect for normal conversational situations and our final development will give us more volume still!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The electronics have also been under scrutiny and we have made some significant changes. The microphones have been changed to more sensitive components, the loudspeakers are now smaller and more powerful and the circuit board is now fully miniaturized.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">And in the background, let´s not forget our programmers writing the mind of the machine! We have now completed the new software architecture which will allow us to bring you regular updates to your mobile app with new languages and improved translation capability. To ensure your safety and privacy, we have also added data encryption between the device and your phone. Shortly we will publish a video with the app in action! We will also be inviting you all to a special VIP member scheme with some tantalizing benefits... but more on this in a later update ;)</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">On the logistical side, we have decided now on our production partners and will be bringing you videos of our visits to these sites over the next few days!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We are sorry that we have missed our initial shipping date and truly appreciate your patience with us. Time flies and technical and logistical challenges arise every day, so we have had to revise our expected shipping to the beginning of next year. As soon as we can give you a more solid date, we will! Tragl will be worth the wait and will be the groundbreaking product you´re expecting, and more!</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Factory visit in Barcelona</h2>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">As promised, this is the first video of our visits to our production partners!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We have been debating whether to undertake production of Tragl in China where we have some attractive offers and short lead times. However, we never quite overcame our doubts about the communication, confidentiality and the product quality.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">So, although the process will be more expensive and lead times are slightly longer, in the end we have decided to produce Tragl in Barcelona and to keep the product European!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">For the production of the numerous plastic parts, we were particularly impressed by the installation you see in the video! The injection moulding machines are new and state of the art, the best on the market. The professional team and quality control is exceptional.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We will be carefully selecting the plastic for suitability for skin contact and the rubber overlay of the earpiece will undergo thorough flexibility and durability tests before deciding which material composition will give you the best user experience!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Don´t worry, Tragl will be of the highest quality!</p>

Its patented audio system allows us to engage in communication using only one device. TRAGL has a front mic that translates what you are saying and transmits your translation via a loudspeaker. The reply is translated to your earpiece. It´s non-intrusive! You don't have to ask anyone to plug in an earbud.When we don’t speak the same language communication is not easy and language barriers can turn into stressful situations. TRAGL is useful in all kinds of daily situations.  It doesn't matter where. TRAGL is useful in many daily situations: ""TRAGL allows me to have a conversation in an easy and comfy way in many situations I could never have imagined. I don't have to worry about language anymore""  1. The front mic translates what you're saying and plays it in the desired language through the front speaker2. Inner earpiece translates directly and only to you3. Artificial Intelligence-enhanced technology helps recognize the voices better and discards sounds and voices out of the conversation4. Rear mic detects ambient sound and other voices to reduce the interference5. Multi-function on / off button  Designed for everybody  The device recognizes your voice through the main microphone, translates and reproduces the translation through the front speaker. When the other person talks, their voice is recognized by the front microphone and is translated to your earbud in 1-2 seconds. We created TRAGL to make communication easier than ever. That’s why this Live Translator comprises software enhanced by Artificial Intelligence that can translate and recognize a conversation faster than other translators.     OUR UPDATESNOVEMBER 2018 

 
Hi Tragl Backers!
 
We have been working hard over the last months to bring you a device you will love to use! So we are really excited to share the new improved design with you!
In the video, Alex is wearing a prototype in a use test. The shorter arm is more compact and is better balanced. This format has also allowed us to better incorporate a resonance chamber to amplify the speaker. As you can hear in the video, the volume is perfect for normal conversational situations and our final development will give us more volume still!
The electronics have also been under scrutiny and we have made some significant changes. The microphones have been changed to more sensitive components, the loudspeakers are now smaller and more powerful and the circuit board is now fully miniaturized.
And in the background, let´s not forget our programmers writing the mind of the machine! We have now completed the new software architecture which will allow us to bring you regular updates to your mobile app with new languages and improved translation capability. To ensure your safety and privacy, we have also added data encryption between the device and your phone. Shortly we will publish a video with the app in action! We will also be inviting you all to a special VIP member scheme with some tantalizing benefits... but more on this in a later update ;)
On the logistical side, we have decided now on our production partners and will be bringing you videos of our visits to these sites over the next few days!
We are sorry that we have missed our initial shipping date and truly appreciate your patience with us. Time flies and technical and logistical challenges arise every day, so we have had to revise our expected shipping to the beginning of next year. As soon as we can give you a more solid date, we will! Tragl will be worth the wait and will be the groundbreaking product you´re expecting, and more!

Factory visit in Barcelona
 
As promised, this is the first video of our visits to our production partners!
We have been debating whether to undertake production of Tragl in China where we have some attractive offers and short lead times. However, we never quite overcame our doubts about the communication, confidentiality and the product quality.
So, although the process will be more expensive and lead times are slightly longer, in the end we have decided to produce Tragl in Barcelona and to keep the product European!
For the production of the numerous plastic parts, we were particularly impressed by the installation you see in the video! The injection moulding machines are new and state of the art, the best on the market. The professional team and quality control is exceptional.
We will be carefully selecting the plastic for suitability for skin contact and the rubber overlay of the earpiece will undergo thorough flexibility and durability tests before deciding which material composition will give you the best user experience!
Don´t worry, Tragl will be of the highest quality!

Thanks to all your support, we reached our stretch goal and can offer a second color. After our campaign ends, you'll get an email with a survey to choose beach blue or cool black.     Lightweight, weatherproof & sandproof            Being based in West Palm Beach, Florida, bike rides to the beach were nearly a daily occurrence for us. And though we loved being at the beach, the ride to the beach was becoming a hassle.  We found ourselves carrying a backpack, and occasionally filling it with a few beverages and a towel, but without the comfort of a chair our beach days were often cut short—and we often returned back with sore bums.  We noticed that others at the beach had a similar dilemma, either bringing a backpack or a chair but rarely both—who has the time and capacity for that. This is where the idea for Bumruk was born.  Our goal was to create something that is as comfortable and convenient as our favorite backpacks, but has the added usability of a chair.  Since then, we have been working our bums off daily to turn this idea into a reality.  After months of research and testing various materials, we created our prototype, made improvements, sourced manufacturing, and are now ready to launch the Bumruk to the public.   Here are just a few of our earlier drawing board ideas.     Choose from our beach bum add-ons.

Beach Towel (every Bumruk comes with one — add another to your order): Dry off with this custom Bumruk beach towel. This 100% cotton towel comes with a strap to stay rolled up when you're on the move. Perfect for placing under your Bumruk on the beach or lawn. Only available to Indiegogo backers.


Tote Bag (every Bumruk comes with one — add another to your order): Perfect laundry bag, beach toy bag, or Bumruk storage. Made from a cotton/polyester blend.

T-shirt: Show your support with your 100% cotton first edition Bumruk T-shirt. Features custom art. Only available to Indiegogo backers.


Koozie: Keep your drinks cold in style with a neoprene Bumruk koozie.

Limited Edition Sticker Pack: Six quality vinyl stickers that will stay stuck. Perfect for your water bottles, coolers, or wherever you like.

NEW Quick-dry Long-sleeve Shirt: The UPF 50 fabric blocks 98 percent of the sun’s rays, protects you like sunscreen.

 Indiegogo is a community full of amazing makers, creators, and early adopters just like us. While biking to the beach we realized the need to improve the beach-going experience and created Bumruk. After months of product development and constant improvements, we not only have the Bumruk, but we also have the manufacturing and fulfillment lined up and ready to go.  With your help we can place our first purchase order and turn this idea into a reality. Your support will be going directly to our first purchase order and you will be rewarded with one of the first Bumruks off the production line at a discounted price. Plus a FREE beach towel! Thank you for the support. We can’t wait to see you at the beach! We’re conscious of the ever-increasing plastic waste and its devastating effect on our environment. Bumruk has been designed with sustainability in mind so the product and its packaging are completely recyclable.We’ve worked hard to design Bumruk to be the last beach chair backpack you’ll have to purchase and in the rare case that certain pieces do wear out, they can be easily swapped out or replaced without having to replace the entire Bumruk.The built in versatility also means that this isn’t just a beach chair but can be used for various applications as well as your everyday backpack.There’s always so much more we can do, so we’ll be on the lookout for new ways to improve our manufacturing process to minimize our environmental footprint as well as looking to partner with ocean conservation efforts.  Ken Williamson and his team at Platinum Global Sourcing have been a huge help with manufacturing, quality control, and inbound logistics.   Russell Marketing is helping us prepare for a successful crowdfunding campaign. Bringing years of crowdfunding experience directly to our team, they have been an invaluable resource in ensuring we are fully prepared for success. Erik Corbin and his team at Rixon Media worked directly with Will and Scott to create our campaign video. We could not be happier with our experience working with them and the content they helped us create. We will be partnering with ONE23 Fulfillment here in West Palm Beach to ensure we deliver your Bumruks in the most timely and efficient way possible. ONE23 has years of experience in direct to consumer fulfillment and have experience fulfilling some of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns.  We are ready to manufacture the Bumruk once we reach our funding goal. We’ve successfully built prototypes with our manufacturer that we have been continuing to test and improve. So far every stage has gone according to schedule or even run ahead of schedule. We have fulfillment in place, and with your help, we will be delivering Bumruks to backers this summer.The global pandemic has introduced obstacles, but we’ve already worked with our partners to update our timelines accordingly. We’ll maintain frequent communication on the progress as things move forward. With our strategic team in place—our partners have 30+ years in sourcing and manufacturing!— we’ve planned ahead to expect the unexpected and deliver Bumruk to you on time. This campaign is a pre-order for our product so the funds raised through Indiegogo will be used to manufacture Bumruk for our backers. In accordance with Indiegogo Terms of Use, we will not offer refunds or return for items that are not defective. All Bumruks come with a 12-month warranty, so in the unlikely event that you receive a faulty Bumruk, please contact us at sales@bumruk.com. Get in touch with us!",48.0,2,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Introducing The Vasco Backpack with Integrated Lunchbox
Now you can have everything you need for a successful day all in one place. Forget about carrying a separate bag for your lunch, and another bag for your documents, and yet another bag just to carry your odds and ends. The Vasco backpack is the future of convenience. 









We’ve designed a special waterproof compartment with thermal layer, excellent for storing a lunchbox or other necessities like towel, shoes, and anything else you can imagine. 

When you don’t need the compartment, simply fold it down and close with the zipper, which allows you to use the backpack’s entire space as you need.





Special inner compartment comes with thermal sealing which keeps your drink cool or warm.


The mug's thermal layer perfectly preserves your drink's temperature.




The side pocket comes with a neat key holder and an extendable cable that retracts automatically.

With our backpack, opening any door is convenient to the max!














 Durable, waterproof material

Waterproof zippers

<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>SUBTECH SPORTS has more than 10 years of experience within product development, marketing and sales of retail products in the sport industry. After successfully launching multiple products, our team is well prepared to foresee and mitigate risks at all stages of product development and launching a campaign.</p>
<p>With that said, we also know that theory and practice are two different things and as a ""startup"" with limited resources, you should communicate frequently with your customers about the situation, available resources, and the plan to deal with challenges now and ahead.</p>
<p>We are not new to crowdfunding and given our recent campaigns on Kickstarter and Indiegogo; PRO DRYBAG 45L, PRO DRYCASE and AWARD-WINNING PRO DRYBAG 2.0 - we learnt a great deal from it. Crowdfunding is a relatively new format between customers and creators and it raises the bar in product development since a significant part of the process happens ”LIVE”. However, challenges like these can at the same time be used as an advantage and result in something good given that both parties collaborate with an open mind.</p>
<p>For this campaign, we have already developed the PRO DRYBAG 3.0 Series so this time around we will move directly into production once the campaign is fully funded which certainly increases the chances of geting these awesome bags out to all of you valuable backers without any delay.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Environmental Impact</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Long-lasting design - </strong>The SUBTECH bags are specifically designed with quality and durability in mind. Our products are being thrown out of planes, dropped in the middle of the ocean, and transported 25 meters below the surface 365 days per year - and still last a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Reusability and recyclability - </strong>We offer the possibility for customers to trade in their used/damaged bags for a discount on their next purchase in order to encourage reusability by giving old bags new life. This is done by our highly skilled engineers and later donated to non-profit organizations that we collaborate with.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable materials - </strong>Investing in sustainable material is truly important for us and as of now, our bags and zippers are made of almost 50% recycled material, but we are constantly developing and testing new materials to improve on this area. Hence, our goal is to have over 90% recycled material in our products by 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Something else - </strong>We are proud to be an official supplier of gear to the Tara Expeditions which aims to study the impacts of climate change and the ecological crisis of the ocean. We also support the World Wildlife Foundation by donating one dollar per sold product that goes directly to WWF Ocean’s program. Furthermore, we supported the Trash-Tiki project who did a four day journey on a raft made of disposable plastic to deliver a message to politicians to put global focus on our ocean and marine resources.</p>

<h2><strong>At TorkStrap™, our vision is to make loading cargo simple and safe for everyone</strong></h2>
<p>    As construction workers and outdoor enthusiasts, our team agreed that while cargo straps were ""working,"" they weren't working well.  Ratchet straps were seizing and users couldn't seem to remember how they worked.  Bungee cords were simple but they were causing more personal injury than most power tools.</p>
<p><i>            ""I watched a bungee go through my neighbors eye.. needless to say I got rid of mine""</i>           -Verified Review</p>
<p>    In December, 2020 we began selling our first run of about 500 Units.  As straps flew off the shelves, we scrambled to figure out how to keep the supply moving ...  after all ... a few months prior, TorkStrap was just an idea.</p>

SKINNERS 2.0. Ultra-versatile, 4-in-1 minimalist footwear with a lightweight, weatherproof, yet durable design. Packed with a perforated insole, long-lasting polymer sole and functional fibers. Designed to keep up with you no matter what adventure you soak into.






Our mission is to provide you with compact yet protective footwear for sports and traveling without all the bulk and weight of regular shoes. The footwear that is easy to use, transport, and maintain without sacrificing comfort, functionality, fit, or safety. The product that adapts to your body, activates each muscle and tendon and lets your feet do their thing. To simply let you move without limits.
Thanks to the compact size and ""second skin"" feeling Skinners is the perfect footwear for sports (short runs, workout, yoga, watersports) and works equally well as a pair of backup shoes (traveling, camping, hiking, cycling).

WALKING & HIKING... Stretch and activate your feet! Skinners adapt to your body, activates each muscle and tendon and let your feet do their thing.

GYM... Non-marking, zero-drop outsoles are perfect for indoor use and promote better posture during squats, deadlifts, and other exercises.

WATERSPORTS... Slip- and cut-resistant outsoles give you the perfect grip, even in wet conditions, and help stay safe around sharp corals.

To be clear, Skinners aren’t intended to completely replace your regular shoes. Instead, think of them as an addition to your shoe rack and training tool for your feet that reminds you what is natural for your body.

It integrates groundbreaking proprietary computer vision technology, Visual Simultaneous Location And Mapping (VSLAM), and artificial neural network algorithms developed by ForwardX, so that it can follow autonomously side-by-side of you. ""The Ovis smart luggage followed me around so well I might buy it."" - Tom's Guide""The ForwardX Ovis is the first smart suitcase custom-built to follow you."" - Digital Trends""Considering the funding ForwardX has already secured $10 million and Chee's pedigree, the company should be able to work things out."" - Forbes""This groundbreaking 'seeing' suitcase is the ultimate carry-on sidekick."" - Maxim Through a series of complex algorithms, we have created an AI that not only “see” as we do, but also identify what it is seeing. What's more, Ovis' side-follow technology is far more advanced then rear following because of the requirement of prediction algorithms. With these state of the art algorithms, Ovis is able to easily stay by your side at all times so you don’t have to be constantly looking over your shoulder just to see your luggage.The obstacle avoidance algorithm of Ovis is based on self-driving technology. This innovative technology is able to accurately sense and assess the environment, calculate the distance, and estimate the direction and route to avoid potential obstacles, with a deviation precision of +/- 1cm.The irremovable batteries can be a major headache for other smart suitcases. But not with Ovis, with the press of one button, you can pop out the battery, go through security and then pop it in and continue enjoying your hands-free luggage.   Ovis' large interior volume of 34L can easily hold enough items for a whole week trip. With durable yet lightweight material, Ovis makes your travel lite and smart. Follow you on all terrainsHighly DurableDeciphering the concept of the unibody design, and cooperating with world's top manufacturer. Ovis provides you with the greatest efficiency and performance with the premium material that is both durable and lightweight. To ensure an extra protection, carbon fiber is used for the corners of Ovis’ wheels. Clocking in at a speed of 3m/s (6.7 mph), Ovis’ revolutionary rear-wheel drive operates quieter and more swift than traditional wheels. Ovis is still a completely functional piece of luxury luggage even at zero percent battery. All four wheels will become omnidirectional, allowing a smooth roll on the ground and a buttery smooth luggage drag. The favorited feature of Ovis is its capability to charge any and all of your devices on the go. Free yourself from searching for outlets at the airport! With Ovis, you will always be prepared for your social media updates, your favorite TV show and your last bit of work before boarding.One of the most valuable features of Ovis is the ability to know how much your luggage weighs at any point so you never have to worry about being overweight for your carry-on. Ovis is able to track the weight in real-time by a system of complex mathematical equations relating to how hard the motor is working, and how far Ovis has traveled. This can simplify life beyond belief when you are packing so you don’t over-pack or worry about under-packing.We are always in constant worry with many “hands-free” devices get lost at any point, even though the system says it is steal-proof. With Ovis, this isn’t a worry due to the Anti-Lost Smart Band. The smart band will vibrate the second that your Ovis is more than 2 meters away from you. It also alerts the owner when the battery of Ovis is running low or when Ovis is experiencing other problems that might need tech support from us.By simply grabbing the handle, you cut all motor power and engage manual mode. This implies that you can drag the luggage at your wish. When Ovis is switched to manual mode, all four wheels become omnidirectional, allowing a smooth roll on the ground and a buttery smooth luggage drag.Fear of losing your luggage at the airport?  Ovis get you covered. The constant GPS tracking module ensures that you will never lose track of your luggage again. Equipped with GPS and 3G technology, and presented as an individual, cut-resistant, modularized luggage tag, the location tracker of Ovis provides you with real-time monitoring and tracking of your belongings - anytime & anywhere. *If you wish to purchase the GPS location tracker, please select the bundle perk which includes one Ovis and one GPS location tracker. *We respect our user’s privacy. The information collected will only be kept locally on Ovis so that you can track your Ovis. However, the GPS info will not be uploaded to our server without your consent.Make it simple! With the customized Ovis App, you’ll be able to track your Ovis, measure the weight of your belongings, monitor your Ovis’ battery life, all with just one click.When you purchase Ovis by ForwardX, you get a product that’s constantly evolving with new and innovative features that enhance and excite the user experience, all through regular firmware updates. - What is Ovis' Computer Vision Technology? -Ovis’ Computer Vision technology is based on machine learning algorithms, allowing the computer to gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos, so that the computer can “see” as what the human's visual system can do. We have achieved the significant breakthrough in the following sub-domains: 
Facial Recognition: 99.1% precision on LFW in face recognition
Pose Estimation: rank 1st in the AI Pose Challenger Bi-weekly Match One

If we’re saying that our bags are the toughest in the world, we need to make darn sure that we’re using the most durable components we can get our hands on. This requires that we hand pick our suppliers and manufacturers from all around the globe to ensure our products are just as industry leading as we say they are. Since the beginning of the design process of the Mobility Collection, it has always been our intention to revisit and revise the materials that we use in the construction of our products. From the leather to the waxed canvas to the nylon linings, we spent many an all-nighter analyzing the pros and cons of various suppliers and their products. Samples were sent, received, tested and sent back. But finally, we got to the point that we had narrowed it down to the best of the best. And then, like many others, we got hit with the global pandemic. Timelines got shifted, shipments were delayed, there were many moving parts to contend with - right up to the very end. Manufacturing or shipping delays are always possible but they are now more likely than ever due to this pandemic. However, we pivoted our strategies and adjusted our protocols and we have got to the point where we are confident in our ability to deliver on time. But as always, a speed bump along the way is a possibility (even when the world is not facing a global pandemic).

SUNGZU SKA2500 always keeps power to your home appliances and power tools , while this super-portable power station strengthens every element such as portability, power, quality, and of course, price.As featured in:Whenever you face a natural disaster like an earthquake, fire, tornado, or flood, the SUNGZU SKA2500 can provide quick access to power for your emergency essentials.You can even use it as an emergency backup for powering your electric vehicles up to 17 extra miles on a single charge.You may be wondering how our device is so much more advanced. This is because the integrated Lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4) —LFP battery pack makes the safety of the battery pack much better. Instead of joining more than 200 individual 18650 batteries together like a traditional power station, the sungzu only has 48pcs individual 32125 model batteries and connections between them. This system greatly reduces the risk of potential accidents to occur.While there is a downside on single li-ion cell size , the significant upside for LFP is safety, which is almost safest and latest materials for power station. Risks will come with using unsafe batteries and fragile cover. SUNGZU SKA2500 adopts the latest materials LiFePO4 batteries, and is regarded as the safest battery with four-times(4X) life-cycle of other lithium batteries such as li-ion polymer battery or LiNiMnCoO2 battery, LiFePO4 battery could last up to 6000 life cycles still maintain 75% capacity, that meant you could use the power station more than 10years (used with full charged and discharged daily ) ,and LiFePO4 battery performed the best in various tests with CE or IEEE standards.We could show a lot of latest technology about our battery pack with more than a day if you want, but now I just show internal structure for most of backer could be understood, How to design 48pcs batteries together to be solid whole, just by welding?

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Unbound was founded by three lifelong best buds. We first met back in the third grade and have done a lot together over the years. In high school we got our first real taste of travel. We used to make art prints depicting our favourite bands and sold them on the road to make enough money to get from one live show to another. We were hooked. </span></p>
<p>We also started a few businesses together. A video production agency and a funky socks brand called Hitsu (socks designed by our favourite street artists). Hitsu opened the door to a lot of creativity, collaboration and inspiration but also gave us a wealth of experience in the manufacturing of apparel.</p>

<p>We now work with ethical manufacturers in 3 countries, source eco-friendly materials and have established an independent fulfillment operation that ships to countries all over the world.</p>
<p>Unbound is a new venture that solves a problem we've had with our own travels. We've been working late nights and weekends on refining what we feel is the perfect travel clothing. We've been testing our prototypes for months (and all over the world) and it's changed our lives. We are so excited to share this with the world. </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>See below for detailed sizing charts. For shirts, the length is how tall the shirt is, the chest width is how wide it is (flat) below the sleeves, and cuff width is how wide the sleeve ends are (flat). For the underwear, the waist width is also measured flat. </p>
<p>So the best thing to do is take a shirt that you like and measure it in this way to see which fit would suit you best. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><span><b>1.  Why doesn’t an Unbound T-shirt smell bad, even if I wear it for days or months at a time? </b></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">To understand why Unbound Merino doesn’t retain odour, it’s first important to understand why most shirts end up smelling after a wear or two. The sweat from your body doesn’t actually have any odour. But when it absorbs into materials like cotton, it becomes a breeding ground for bacteria - which is where those bad smells come from. Merino wool doesn’t give sweat the opportunity to develop bacteria because of how effectively it wicks the moisture away from your body. Merino constantly pulls sweat away from the body allowing it to evaporate. This keeps you dry and keeps your shirt from smelling bad.</span></p>
<p>We have put our product to the test like you wouldn’t believe. We have tried to find the limits of how many wears our clothing could handle before absolutely needing a wash and we haven’t found that limit yet.</p>
<p>Here is an example of what one of our prototype shirts has gone through without a single wash:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Worn 46 days in a row without exception</p></li>
<li><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">In that 46 days worn in the gym around 6 or 7 times through heavy cardio (testing the product was the motivation for the gym more so than sheer discipline)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Worn twice in the sauna (we meant it when we said we took this to the limits)</p></li>
<li><p>Worn to bed some nights and stayed on the body right through the day</p></li>
<li><p>Taken to Shanghai, Bangkok and Koh Tao, Thailand and worn daily in sweltering 40 degree weather.  (see our Indiegogo video)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above was done without a wash. It never smelled. Not even slightly.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that whenever it was worn and heavily perspired into, it was hung up to air out and dry off before being put back on. Nobody wants to wear a wet shirt, and it does need to air out so that the moisture wicks away and bacteria isn’t formed. When alternating between 2 or 3 shirts over a trip, you can go months without a wash with ease.</p>
<p><b>2.  Can I wear Unbound underwear everyday without a wash?</b></p>
<p>This is one of the more awkward questions to answer... The short answer is yes. Absolutely. But that’s assuming you keep yourself clean. Catch our drift? Unlike cotton underwear, these will wick away moisture and prevent any odour causing bacteria so they can be worn for many days without a wash. That said, life happens so use your judgement and refresh these with a quick hand wash and air dry as  frequently as you require.</p>
<p><b>3.  Where is your clothing made?</b></p>
<p>Our shirts and underwear are made in facilities in Hangzhou and Jiaxing, China and our socks are made in our hometown of Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p><b>4.  When I do wash my Unbound Apparel, what are the care instructions?</b></p>
<p>Your shirts, socks and underwear can be washed in a regular washing machine at a normal or cool temperature setting. Use regular detergent and avoid fabric softener. We prefer to hand wash because it’s easier and quicker (when travelling) but the choice is yours.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: DO NOT TUMBLE DRY. After a wash, ring out the water and lay your clothing flat on a towel to air dry, flipping periodically. Don’t leave directly in the sun to dry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>5.  Where will your clothing ship from?</b></p>
<p>All orders will ship from Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p><b>6.  When can I expect my order to arrive?</b></p>
<p>All orders will ship within 6-8 weeks from the last day of the campaign. Shipping within Canada should take 3-5 days from the date of shipment, In the US should take 5-7 days and international orders should take around 4-6 weeks.  </p>
<p><b>7. What if my order just doesn’t fit right?</b></p>
<p>We are happy to offer exchanges if your Unbound shirt doesn’t fit right. Just send your order back to us within 15 days and we’ll send the right size. However, we are unable to exchange underwear and socks for sanitary reasons. So please refer to our sizing chart as carefully as possible!</p>
<p><b>8.  Wool sounds itchy, is Merino wool itchy?</b></p>
<p>Not at all. It feels completely different to the touch than the traditional wool you’re thinking of. It’s light and soft on the skin and with it’s moisture wicking properties it maintains that smooth feel all day, even when you perspire while wearing it.</p>
<p><b>9.  Why do you need to run an Indiegogo campaign to launch?</b></p>We love the product we developed, and made it to fill our own need. Indiegogo is our way of sharing the idea with the world and raising the funds to meet our minimum order quantities with the manufacturers. We hope it resonates with you because we know you will love the product as much as we do. </div>

Unbound is a line of clothing that will allow you to see more of the world, without the burden of hauling around bulky luggage. Stylish, simple merino wool apparel that can be worn for weeks or even months - without ever needing to be washed.  Which means you can ditch the big suitcase, because all you'll need is your backpack. We've created the travel essentials that will bring out the true minimalist in you.
 
          Because Unbound Merino is anti-bacterial, moisture wicking and odour-resistant, a 2-week trip no longer requires 2 weeks worth of shirts, socks and underwear. 2 of each is more than enough to last you a few weeks, or even months without your clothes ever smelling and with no visit to the laundromat.    From the airplane, to the gym, to a night out on the town, Unbound travel apparel stays clean and fresh no matter where you find yourself or what you put it through. That means when packing for a trip, you can drastically cut down the amount of clothing you pack and travel light, fast and free.     When creating Unbound we worked collaboratively with some of the best manufacturers of cottons, wools and technical fibres in the world. Here's why we chose Merino as the perfect fibre for travel: 
 
 

  
 

The textured light grey  keeps you cool and comfortable in the sun. The Black V-neck or Crew can be dressed up and perfect once the sun sets and you find yourself at a nice restaurant or club. And of course, the basics; the highest performance socks and underwear you'll ever put on.     Until now, Merino has been traditionally used for high-performance active wear. That means flashy colours, intricate patterns and very athletic fits and functionality. It also means it’s expensive and hard to find. Since we cut out the middle man, Unbound Merino costs a fraction of the price of merino activewear.     The benefits of Unbound go beyond travel. Having less (but better) stuff will not only simplify your life abroad, it will also add simplicity to your life at home. Here are just some of the things that will happen when you Live Unbound:You’ll have less laundry to do. Your laundry machine will be lonelier than ever. With a wardrobe full of clothing that rarely needs to be washed, you’ll save time, money and energy. It’s one less thing to think about.There’s an endless amount of decisions to be made from the second you wake up.  Spend less time deciding what to wear in the morning, so you can keep focused on the things that really matter.You’ll always look great.In a perfect world, you would be wearing your favourite clothing every day. Unbound lets you live in that world. Clothing that doesn’t go through the wash cycle with every wear keeps it’s form and fit. It’s like the first time you put it on, every time.You’ll own clothing with real value.A lot of clothing purchased today is more or less disposable. It’s designed to deteriorate after a few wears. While it may seem to be a cheaper option with the initial purchase - it ends up costing more over time. Not to mention the human and environmental cost. Having a few items that last long create more value in the long run and is a better way to live.And One More Thing…Some people would say that wearing the same thing every day is weird and unfashionable. We say Steve Jobs was onto something. His clothing became his uniform, and his uniform asserted his status as a true icon.Alice Gregory, a writer living in New York, had this to say about what happens when you wear the same thing every day: “This is the reason why characters in picture books never change their outfit: Children—like adults, if they’d only admit it—crave continuity. Adopting the habit of wearing a uniform is not unstylish—this is a classification that no longer applies.”  
 
 


 
One trip without the physical and mental burden of luggage and we promise you will be more aware and focused, in harmony with the moment and able to enjoy the culture that surrounds you. As you begin to truly feel free, you will finally be unbound from the material world you left at home.
Picasso said that art is about the elimination of the unnecessary. Unbound is about the art of travel. It’s about inspiring people to travel lighter, simpler, and smarter.



 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 

Unbound was founded by three lifelong best buds. We first met back in the third grade and have done a lot together over the years. In high school we got our first real taste of travel. We used to make art prints depicting our favourite bands and sold them on the road to make enough money to get from one live show to another. We were hooked. 
We also started a few businesses together. A video production agency and a funky socks brand called Hitsu (socks designed by our favourite street artists). Hitsu opened the door to a lot of creativity, collaboration and inspiration but also gave us a wealth of experience in the manufacturing of apparel.
 
 
 Since launching Hitsu 2 years ago, we’ve nurtured strong relationships with our manufacturers and learned a ton about the ins and outs of effective, high quality garment making.
We now work with ethical manufacturers in 3 countries, source eco-friendly materials and have established an independent fulfillment operation that ships to countries all over the world.
Unbound is a new venture that solves a problem we've had with our own travels. We've been working late nights and weekends on refining what we feel is the perfect travel clothing. We've been testing our prototypes for months (and all over the world) and it's changed our lives. We are so excited to share this with the world.

See below for detailed sizing charts. For shirts, the length is how tall the shirt is, the chest width is how wide it is (flat) below the sleeves, and cuff width is how wide the sleeve ends are (flat). For the underwear, the waist width is also measured flat. 
So the best thing to do is take a shirt that you like and measure it in this way to see which fit would suit you best. 

 
 
1.  Why doesn’t an Unbound T-shirt smell bad, even if I wear it for days or months at a time? 
To understand why Unbound Merino doesn’t retain odour, it’s first important to understand why most shirts end up smelling after a wear or two. The sweat from your body doesn’t actually have any odour. But when it absorbs into materials like cotton, it becomes a breeding ground for bacteria - which is where those bad smells come from. Merino wool doesn’t give sweat the opportunity to develop bacteria because of how effectively it wicks the moisture away from your body. Merino constantly pulls sweat away from the body allowing it to evaporate. This keeps you dry and keeps your shirt from smelling bad.
We have put our product to the test like you wouldn’t believe. We have tried to find the limits of how many wears our clothing could handle before absolutely needing a wash and we haven’t found that limit yet.
Here is an example of what one of our prototype shirts has gone through without a single wash:

Worn 46 days in a row without exception
In that 46 days worn in the gym around 6 or 7 times through heavy cardio (testing the product was the motivation for the gym more so than sheer discipline)
Worn twice in the sauna (we meant it when we said we took this to the limits)
Worn to bed some nights and stayed on the body right through the day
Taken to Shanghai, Bangkok and Koh Tao, Thailand and worn daily in sweltering 40 degree weather.  (see our Indiegogo video)

All of the above was done without a wash. It never smelled. Not even slightly.
It’s important to note that whenever it was worn and heavily perspired into, it was hung up to air out and dry off before being put back on. Nobody wants to wear a wet shirt, and it does need to air out so that the moisture wicks away and bacteria isn’t formed. When alternating between 2 or 3 shirts over a trip, you can go months without a wash with ease.
2.  Can I wear Unbound underwear everyday without a wash?
This is one of the more awkward questions to answer... The short answer is yes. Absolutely. But that’s assuming you keep yourself clean. Catch our drift? Unlike cotton underwear, these will wick away moisture and prevent any odour causing bacteria so they can be worn for many days without a wash. That said, life happens so use your judgement and refresh these with a quick hand wash and air dry as  frequently as you require.
3.  Where is your clothing made?
Our shirts and underwear are made in facilities in Hangzhou and Jiaxing, China and our socks are made in our hometown of Toronto, Canada.
4.  When I do wash my Unbound Apparel, what are the care instructions?
Your shirts, socks and underwear can be washed in a regular washing machine at a normal or cool temperature setting. Use regular detergent and avoid fabric softener. We prefer to hand wash because it’s easier and quicker (when travelling) but the choice is yours.
IMPORTANT: DO NOT TUMBLE DRY. After a wash, ring out the water and lay your clothing flat on a towel to air dry, flipping periodically. Don’t leave directly in the sun to dry.
 
5.  Where will your clothing ship from?
All orders will ship from Toronto, Canada.
6.  When can I expect my order to arrive?
All orders will ship within 6-8 weeks from the last day of the campaign. Shipping within Canada should take 3-5 days from the date of shipment, In the US should take 5-7 days and international orders should take around 4-6 weeks.  
7. What if my order just doesn’t fit right?
We are happy to offer exchanges if your Unbound shirt doesn’t fit right. Just send your order back to us within 15 days and we’ll send the right size. However, we are unable to exchange underwear and socks for sanitary reasons. So please refer to our sizing chart as carefully as possible!
8.  Wool sounds itchy, is Merino wool itchy?
Not at all. It feels completely different to the touch than the traditional wool you’re thinking of. It’s light and soft on the skin and with it’s moisture wicking properties it maintains that smooth feel all day, even when you perspire while wearing it.
9.  Why do you need to run an Indiegogo campaign to launch?We love the product we developed, and made it to fill our own need. Indiegogo is our way of sharing the idea with the world and raising the funds to meet our minimum order quantities with the manufacturers. We hope it resonates with you because we know you will love the product as much as we do. 


Putting this campaign together has been an amazing and fun learning experience, to say the very least. We couldn’t have done it without the help and support of the following companies and people. THANK YOU

<p>It starts with Leroy Chausse, my father. I was lucky to grow up on the remnants of a large farm in southern Idaho, where there was a house, a milk barn and some dilapidated old tractors. Dad and I built everything in that old milk barn: it became our wood shop, laboratory, and fab emporium. My dad had high standards, and I learned to build and dream living up to those exacting principles.</p>
<p> A whole new world of processes, close tolerances and finishes revealed itself to me when I was introduced to machining while in the mechanical engineering program at Montana State University. With degree in hand, I started Big Sky Precision in 1993 in a 400-square foot garage.</p>
<p> Our first hitch pin was born in 2018, on the very day I whacked my shin on my pickup’s original hitch. Conventional hitch pins are not easy to remove, and I was tired of skinning my knuckles every time in the process. Our first quick release hitch pin didn’t have a key lock, but it worked! In fact, it worked too well. When moving our son Daniel to eastern Montana, we pulled away from a gas stop to see our trailer dangling from the chains. While in the station store, someone had stolen the pin from our receiver hitch! This was our inspiration to integrate a USA-made key lock into the handle.</p>
<p> My dad’s expectations of excellence run deep in the family, continuing with our son Jon. Using the latest in computer CAD/CAM, solid modeling and high speed machining, Jon brings elegance and durability to the functionality of our hitch pins.</p>
<p>The Hilgard Pin™ is the result of three years of tweaks, improvements, trial and error.</p>

We are currently manufacturing the first 1000 units that will be shipped out. Here comes a short intro and feature list for your convenience:Sonnet creates an independent wireless network that allows smart devices to communicate over long distance - without cell service.FEATURESP2P RANGE Sonnet offers 40-60% more point-to-point range than FRS, CB or any unlicensed two-way radios. Connect with another Sonnet up to 15km/9 miles away with line of sight, or 5km/3 miles with no line of sight. PROTOCOL FEATURES

Mesh Network: Sonnet signal can relay through intermediary Sonnets to reach a distant receiver - up to 16 times. This allows a few Sonnet devices to cover a widely spread-out team, or a property of thousands of acres.

Multimedia: Communicate in not only text, but also GPS, voice, image, files and binary data. This also open doors for remote equipment control. 

Internet Sharing: One Sonnet can choose to share its internet with the entire network. This can be done through its cellular data, home wifi internet, or satellite phone connection


Banking Level Security: Sonnet is built on a foundation engineered to support security. Communication is end-to-end encrypted using AES (256-bit) security, keeps your communication private.

Global Coverage: Sonnet operates in the legal, license-free frequency of your country.
 SOFTWARE FEATURES

Private & Group Messages: Just like what you do on WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger.

SMA Connector: Extend range with extra external antennas, with or without a license. 

Offline Maps: Save high-res topographic maps and access them without internet.


GPS Tracking: Log locations, set beacons, and know where your companions are in real-time.

Native App: No need to download app, everything is pre-installed on Sonnet (iOS/Android apps still available).

SOS Mode: Broadcast your GPS location and a distress message to all Sonnet users in range.

Linux Computer: Sonnet has a full-featured Linux computer inside. With our SDK, coders can write their own firmware on Sonnet. This also opens door to integration with other off-grid apps and resources, e.g. SCADA.
 HARDWARE FEATURES

Compatibility: iOS/Android smartphones, laptop, tablet, sat phones and more .... Sonnet works with all smart devices.

Military-Grade Durability: IP66 rating resists rain, moisture, and dust.

Charging: Power your phone with a built-in 4000mAh battery.

Group Pairing: Multiple devices can connect to each Sonnet simultaneously.

USB Port: Industry-standard USB lets Sonnet support a wide range of devices e.g. cellular dongle, GPS dongle, Ethernet adapter...

Relay Mode: Sonnet can act as a signal relay tower without any devices paired.


HAM Operators can use custom frequencies (100-1000mhz), power output (<3W), and antennas.
 EXTENSIBILITY

Internet Modem: Need internet in the wilderness? Leave one Sonnet connected to your internet modem and carry another with you, allowing you internet access.

Cellular Dongle: Share cellular connection for the entire network by connecting your Sonnet to a cellular dongle. 

Solar Panel: Connect your Sonnet to a solar panel, and turn it into a powerful, permanent signal repeater at any location on your network.

Sensor: Use the Sonnet with sensors and create a monitoring network that easily covers a property of 100 square km – operated remotely.

Vehicle/Drone: To improve the Sonnet’s line of sight and range, use the Sonnet’s mount screw to position it on the top of a vehicle or drone, improving your signal strength.

Satellite Phone: Connect one Sonnet to a satellite phone and share your signal with your entire mesh network across potentially thousands of hectares, meaning only one of your team members needs a satellite phone
Your phone is dependent on the mobile network, and they can't keep you connected when the mobile network is unavailable or unreliable, such as when you are:

Exploring the backcountry: network is unavailable or very sparse coverage

Traveling abroad: network unreliable or very expensive to use

Attending crowded events: network slow and congested with too many users

Encountering a natural disaster: network service disrupted or completely destroyed

We quickly realized that the mission is much greater than that: by making long-range mesh networking technology that is secure, easy-to-use, and accessible to everyone, we can lay the foundation for creating a truly open, decentralized digital communication network, built for and powered by the people.We are based in Boston, Massachusetts, and our team comprises of amazing people who have worked in Motorola, Honeywell, and Hai'er.Sonnet is currently under production. Check 'Updates' section for our weekly manufacturing updates! Here comes some production pictures: Sonnet prototypes:The Sonnet will be shipped worldwide with tracked shipping. Due to variations in shipping rates across the globe, the tier prices do not include shipping fees. These fees are separately calculated based on your shipping country and will be automatically added when you complete your pledge on Indiegogo.Any applicable import duties, taxes, or tariffs are the responsibility of the backer. Please be aware of your local import procedures before choosing to back our project.",56.0,0,"1 Campaign

The bag industry is no exception. Never fear. We’ve done the hard work of figuring out what we can do to ensure you will be getting your FINO amid these uncertain times. Of course, supply chains are the biggest issue.

Your FINO bag inherits the merit of a holster, allows you to pack all your stuff while still being able to maintain good shape, whether you carry it outside or inside your jacket.  You never know where the day (or night) might lead, so it’s good to have a bag that can keep up. Get more out of your gear by opting for a bag with the aesthetics and feature set to adapt to changing needs and environments, such as pivoting from work or school settings into outdoor, sports scenarios. 
Size: 400 x 240 x 30 (mm) / 15.7 x 9.6 x 1.2 (in)
Dedicated compartment for a cellphone with size no larger than the iPhone 11 Pro Max with a protective case on.
​  In slim mode, FINO is able to carry your most frequently used items, such as phone, portable charger, wallet, earphones, keys and other miscellaneous items.When extended, it is able to store larger gadgets like your Switch or Kindle.    Made with thermoplastic polyurethane, the pouch is the perfect solution to temporarily store your used mask.  Seal to contain and prevent your mask from contaminating the rest of your bag's contents.  It's designed to be self-adhesive to the velvet lining, making it easy to rip-to-remove from the front pocket for sterilization.    
Premium YKK strap stopper
Adaptable for right or left-handed users
Adjust the length to suit your needs
 Rapid Adjust Pull-tab 
      We CNC this self-adaptive pivot from a fine piece of copper to ensure that the strap will stay comfortably on your shoulder regardless of your body size or shape. But our team didn't stop there. We want the FINO sling pack to look more sleek and elegant, so we decide to upgrade the material from copper to aluminum. We don't make it good, we make it great.    Avoid unnecessary strain by choosing a bag that’s comfortable for the commute to work or school. Features such as suitable padding, a rapid-retract shoulder strap and sufficient ventilation all play their part in keeping you comfy on the go.   The rubberized hanger can help to carry your stuff easily on the go, giving you flexible, fun and hassle-free travel.    
Quick and easy access to the main compartment & cellphone pocket
Only one hand operation needed
​     We upgraded the design of our signature cellphone pocket, moving it to the inner side of the pack to make it completely theft-proof. Your valuables are safe with us.     Add-ons CLICK HERE TO VIEW MORE DETAILS CLICK HERE TO VIEW MORE DETAILSThe Design  The Impact of COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed all manner of uncertainty across the world. The bag industry is no exception. Never fear. We’ve done the hard work of figuring out what we can do to ensure you will be getting your FINO amid these uncertain times. Of course, supply chains are the biggest issue.

Your perfect travel piece, it’s got five pockets for storing your phone, wallet, gloves, and more, plus it’s coated with a DWR application to keep light precipitation at bay. The Whistler will keep you protected from winds while serving as an easy-to-pack layer, from the mountains to the city and beyond. Our specially-made HiloTech Self-Healing Material uses the friction and heat produced by rubbing your fingers over the material to repair small punctures in seconds. No joke: you can bring your Whistler back to life instantly after it gets small holes or tears!
 
Rub your fingers over any small puncture and watch the fabric repair itself in seconds.Made from a unique combination of repairable material and nylon ripstop, HiloTech is revolutionizing the way lightweight jackets are made. Now you can bushwack, fence hop, or scale a crag without worrying your jacket will be destroyed. This hi-tech fabric will even prolong the lifespan of your jacket! 
 
  Our HiloTech material utilizes specially woven nylon yarns that are constructed of microscopic fibers. The grid-like weave reinforces the materials and prevents the fabric from ripping or tearing.Just like the microscopic hairs on an insect’s legs can give it grip to cling to plants and trees, the tiny fibers in the HiloTech material allow the fabric to adhere itself back together, time and time again.

The padded belt gives added support for heavy loads and long carries and is also completely removable.  When removed, the double-duty hip belt completely transforms into a standalone travel bag that can be worn as a hip pack or sling!Lockable zipper heads on the main exterior zipper keeps items secure, while an undetectable secret pocket sits directly on your back to keep cash or documents safe and hidden. A loop at the bottom of the bag, perfect for a bike light, adds added visibility for bike rides and walking down dark roads with the pack.​The Pakt TSA pocket was developed to make the security checkpoint as easy as possible. Pull it out to stash the items you’ll need to remove, rather than relying on the plastic bins. Once through security, rather than join the scramble of travelers collecting their different belongings, you can quickly grab your bag and head to a comfortable spot to reorganize.  The red label serves as a reminder to grab your laptop or anything that you had to send through the X-Ray separately. Add-on accessories can be selected during check out.Please note:  Accessory colorway options are subject to change depending on demand. Our packing cube set is sized to perfectly fill the two sides of the Pakt Travel Backpack to maximize your use of the volume. A set includes 5 total pieces, consisting of 3 different sizes and styles: two large zippered cubes, 2 small zippered cubes, and one stuff sack style bag for items that you don't fold – like socks or underwear. The zippered cubes feature a translucent fabric top panel that allows you to easily identify contents without opening each cube. The rain cover fits snugly over your Pakt Backpack providing an extra layer of protection against the elements. It features a hooded Aquaguard zipper to allow access to the lower front pocket, so your items are always within reach. The packable tote is an upgraded version of a popular tote we made for our Pakt One bag. It's compact and lightweight, and folds into an attached pocket which you can stash perfectly in a mesh interior pocket. Unpack it at your destination to use it as a laundry, beach, or shopping bag. It’s also great as a shoe bag to make sure they don’t get your clothes dirty.  We have been developing the Travel Backpack for over a year and already invested a lot of time and money to begin our first production order. Unlike many crowdfunding projects, we are well beyond the prototype stage. This approach requires more up front investment, but it enables us to have a shorter and more accurate timeline for the delivery of your packs. Also, as a backer, you don’t have to wonder if the project will even succeed!  We should also mention that producing great bags and travel products is not new territory for us. We have years of experience in this industry, and we’ve successfully produced and delivered tens of thousands of bags – all produced with the same factory partners.  The Vietnamese factory we work with has been vetted extensively for workplace conditions, safety measures, and labor practices. We have worked with them for years and made multiple factory visits during production runs. We traveled there again to work side-by-side with them during the design and development of this backpack. We are proud to call them both partners and friends.  We are so confident you’ll love the Pakt Travel Backpack that we guarantee it! When you receive your bag(s), if you’re not 100% satisfied with the design or quality simply send it back for a full refund of the purchase price (shipping and handling fees are non-refundable). We’re pretty sure you’ll be more excited to plan a trip than return it though!We also stand behind all our bags with a lifetime guarantee. This covers manufacturing defects and excessive damage occurring during normal use. Normal wear and tear from everyday use is not covered. We hope your bag is perfect, but if you notice a problem, just let us know and we will work with you to make things right. We believe that the only truly “sustainable” product development is none at all. But since that option isn’t compatible with the lives we lead and the world we live in, we’re going with the next best thing: producing products as responsibly as possible, building them to last, and designing them to be versatile so that the buyer can minimize the number of products they need.We choose the exterior fabric to be constructed using rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate), which is created from fibers that were once single-use plastics. As a company that is continuously optimizing our supply chain to decrease the environmental impact of our products, we’re thrilled to be using a recycled material for this pack.When it comes to packaging, we’ve kept it minimal for the Pakt Travel Backpack, as we do all Pakt products. This gives us the ability to fit more products into fewer shipping containers to keep our carbon footprint as low as possible when transporting and storing bags. There is no “small box within a big box” with extra padding materials. We worked hard to find a fulfillment center partner that could hold up our commitment to plastic-free packaging and work with a totally plastic-free facility that reuses shredded old boxes as filler if any is ever needed.All Pakt product packaging is 100% plastic-free and designed by our sister company, SeaHive, where we fight the huge environmental issue caused by plastic product packaging, and other ocean conservation efforts. If you don’t know him, Chase Reeves is the internet’s favorite bag expert (and our favorite all-around wildman). Back in 2018, Chase Reeves reached out during our crowdfunding campaign to review the Pakt One for his YouTube channel. We were instantly impressed with his extensive bag knowledge and knew we had to find a way to collaborate with him and tap his bag knowledge to make sure our backpack was next level. The results? The best damn travel bag you’ll ever carry. Hi! We’re Pakt. We were founded in 2018 to make refined, responsibly-sourced travel goods designed to #keeptravelsimple. As design freaks who are also environmentally-conscious, we take incredible care to only create products that we believe are useful, beautiful, and necessary. Our first product, a cult favorite travel bag called The Pakt One, raised more than $2 million via crowdfunding and is now available on our website. The Pakt Coffee Kit, our second product, was released over summer ‘19 and has raised over 500k. The Pakt Travel Backpack is our third product, and we don’t have plans to slow down.This is not our first crowdfunding campaign. The Pakt team has put together a strong supply chain, from materials suppliers to manufacturers to shipping and fulfillment partners.We already have invested both time and funds into the pilot production to order materials and hardware and begin production. Our product is well beyond the prototype stage, as we have been producing and refining this pack for over a year. This approach enables us to have a shorter and more accurate timeline from the launch of this campaign to the time packs are delivered to backers.Since our product is beyond the prototype stage, we are able to more accurately assess timelines for backers. We are working closely with our partners on this pilot production and it is moving along at a healthy pace.We also want to acknowledge the seriousness of the COVID19 situation that is on everyone’s mind, including ours. We are planning for the production of this bag with not only the product, but also the people involved in mind. Plans may need to be adjusted, but as always, we will share updates from the process along the way.  As with any manufactured good, delays can happen -- a typhoon can hit, or a pallet can get stuck in a shipyard. We’ve padded our schedule to accommodate some changes, but will let our backers know immediately if we foresee any updates to the timeline for delivery.",69.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p><strong>Designed by cyclists, for cyclists; SmartHalo 2 is the all-in-one connected device that breathes life into your bike. </strong>It helps you discover new routes with clear navigation signals. It protects your bike with an ear-piercing anti-theft alarm. It lights your way with a completely redesigned, all-powerful front light. It tracks and displays your cycling metrics without having to push a single button, syncing with the fitness apps you already use. It keeps you connected to what matters with the brand new, customizable PeekDisplay™. And it looks, feels, and works unlike any bike computer out there. </p>

<h3>We’re Back</h3>
<p>This is not our first rodeo. Back in 2015, we took Kickstarter by storm with the first SmartHalo, with over 3,000 pledges from the community. Since then, we’ve delivered <strong>25,000 units</strong> to cyclists in over 70 countries. We struck a deal with <strong>Apple</strong>, distributing in their stores all over North America and Europe. We’re quite proud and it's all thanks to you. </p>

<h3>A Minimalist Interface Designed for Cycling</h3>
<p><strong>We're obsessed with simplicity – we want cyclists to focus on their ride, not on tech.</strong> That's why there's no on or off button on SmartHalo. It greets you with a colorful animation of your choice as soon as you hop on your bike and turns off on its own when you're done riding.</p>
<p>Our patented, luminous halo gives you just what you need, at a glance. It lights up in the direction of your turns. When you’re aiming for that fitness achievement, your progress fills up. When receiving an incoming call, it pulsates like a heartbeat – a loved one is calling. <strong>This is not another overly complex bike computer. </strong> </p>

<h3>Combining the Circle's Simplicity to the Pixel's Versatility</h3>
<p>We went the extra step to make sure SmartHalo 2 fits your biking life. We’re <strong>introducing PeekDisplay™, a complementary way to show you more, without distracting you.</strong> With its crisp white pixels, it complements our signature Halo and makes every single SmartHalo feature better and more comprehensive, while still keeping it simple.</p>

<h3>This Is YOUR SmartHalo</h3>
<p><strong>Customization is at the core of SmartHalo 2.</strong> You choose which bike metrics to display. Need some help getting to your destination? Choose the route type you prefer. You can even define your own shortcuts: an easy way to trigger the features you use most, without taking your phone out. Combined with new swipe gestures, <strong>PeekDisplay</strong>™ allows you to do more with SmartHalo, and do it your way. Your bike, your ride, your SmartHalo.  </p>

<h3>Always There for You</h3>
<p><strong>Urban cyclists know the pains of bike theft.</strong> Unlike other bike accessories, SmartHalo 2 remains on your bike at all times: it's securely locked on your handlebar and only your unique <strong>HaloKey™</strong> can unlock it. This means SmartHalo 2 is always there for you, ready to guide you, measure your performance and assist you. When you leave, it seamlessly arms the motion-triggered alarm. No need to think about it: your bike is protected against theft.</p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.smarthalo.bike/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/mount.gif"" src=""""/><p>Just like every facet of SmartHalo 2, we also improved version 2 of our anti-theft mount: it's sturdier and won't stay stuck. Your new HaloKey™ is also thinner and tougher. </p>

<p><strong>We’ve even made it easier to use on any type of bike, thanks to Quarter Lock Mount Adapter. </strong>This also means you can easily switch SmartHalo from one bike to another. It also makes it way easier to use SmartHalo on road, shared and rental bikes.</p>

It helps you discover new routes with clear navigation signals. It protects your bike with an ear-piercing anti-theft alarm. It lights your way with a completely redesigned, all-powerful front light. It tracks and displays your cycling metrics without having to push a single button, syncing with the fitness apps you already use. It keeps you connected to what matters with the brand new, customizable PeekDisplay™. And it looks, feels, and works unlike any bike computer out there. 

We’re Back
This is not our first rodeo. Back in 2015, we took Kickstarter by storm with the first SmartHalo, with over 3,000 pledges from the community. Since then, we’ve delivered 25,000 units to cyclists in over 70 countries. We struck a deal with Apple, distributing in their stores all over North America and Europe. We’re quite proud and it's all thanks to you. 


What They Said About SmartHalo 1

 


 
A Minimalist Interface Designed for Cycling
We're obsessed with simplicity – we want cyclists to focus on their ride, not on tech. That's why there's no on or off button on SmartHalo. It greets you with a colorful animation of your choice as soon as you hop on your bike and turns off on its own when you're done riding.
Our patented, luminous halo gives you just what you need, at a glance. It lights up in the direction of your turns. When you’re aiming for that fitness achievement, your progress fills up. When receiving an incoming call, it pulsates like a heartbeat – a loved one is calling. This is not another overly complex bike computer.  
 
 
Combining the Circle's Simplicity to the Pixel's Versatility
We went the extra step to make sure SmartHalo 2 fits your biking life. We’re introducing PeekDisplay™, a complementary way to show you more, without distracting you. With its crisp white pixels, it complements our signature Halo and makes every single SmartHalo feature better and more comprehensive, while still keeping it simple.
  
This Is YOUR SmartHalo
Customization is at the core of SmartHalo 2. You choose which bike metrics to display. Need some help getting to your destination? Choose the route type you prefer. You can even define your own shortcuts: an easy way to trigger the features you use most, without taking your phone out. Combined with new swipe gestures, PeekDisplay™ allows you to do more with SmartHalo, and do it your way. Your bike, your ride, your SmartHalo.  

  
Always There for You
Urban cyclists know the pains of bike theft. Unlike other bike accessories, SmartHalo 2 remains on your bike at all times: it's securely locked on your handlebar and only your unique HaloKey™ can unlock it. This means SmartHalo 2 is always there for you, ready to guide you, measure your performance and assist you. When you leave, it seamlessly arms the motion-triggered alarm. No need to think about it: your bike is protected against theft. Just like every facet of SmartHalo 2, we also improved version 2 of our anti-theft mount: it's sturdier and won't stay stuck. Your new HaloKey™ is also thinner and tougher. 

We’ve even made it easier to use on any type of bike, thanks to Quarter Lock Mount Adapter. This also means you can easily switch SmartHalo from one bike to another. It also makes it way easier to use SmartHalo on road, shared and rental bikes.

 

 SmartHalo 2 has some new moves, all made possible thanks to PeekDisplay™. It also revisits every feature you know and love from generation 1 and improves them drastically.   Smartphone and traditional bike computer displays can be difficult to parse. We want you to focus on the road. Simply set your destination in the app, choose your favorite route type and put your phone in your pocket – you’re good to go. The luminous halo will guide you, lighting up and gradually filling up in the direction of your incoming turn.  
 Unlike other bike GPS devices, there's no need to preload any maps or any of that non-sense: just grab your phone and you're good to go. We’re using Google to make our maps and search the best out there: this means that you should be able to find any place you’re looking for. For turn-by-turn directions, we’re using HaloRoute™, our own routing system, custom made for cyclists. You can choose between the fastest, safest, flattest or our recommended route.  When only the destination counts, use Compass mode. SmartHalo will then only point towards your goal and turn greener as you get closer. How you get there is up to you. Had a long day and can’t remember where you parked your bike? Our app will remind you where you left it with Parking Reminder. Based on requests from the community, we’re introducing GPX Imports to SmartHalo: simply import any GPX in the app. We’re also adding Waypoints, for when you need to do a few stops along the way. Route planning has never been stronger with SmartHalo 2.  SmartHalo stays on your bike, remember? When you’re not around, it becomes the guardian of your bike. Any persistent meddling will trigger a 110 dB alarm: enough to fend off the most persistent thief.
 As soon as you get back to your bike, SmartHalo detects the SmartHalo app running in the background of your phone. It then proceeds to disable the alarm and greet you. Lost your phone or it ran out of battery? Don't panic! Simply input your custom Tapcode (a combination of long and short taps, a bit like morse code) on the device to manually deactivate the alarm. Cycling metrics such as speed, distance, calories, elevation, CO2 saved and time are tracked automatically as soon as you start pedalling. No need to press “start” or “stop”, SmartHalo will save every ride. Feel like showing off? Simply push your rides to Strava (or Apple Health. Or Google Fit. Up to you!). Want more integrations? Tell us in the comments! With our new PeekDisplay™, metrics are displayed in real-time on your device. And just like every other facet of SmartHalo 2, you decide which ones you want to see. Just swipe left or right to switch between your chosen metrics.  SmartHalo 2 sports a completely redesigned, all-powerful front light. It is now a whopping 5x brighter than the original version. In addition, it is compliant with some of the newer, stricter regulations in Europe (we’ve heard you, German friends). SmartHalo 2 sports a completely redesigned, all-powerful front light. It is now a whopping 5x brighter than the original version. In addition, it is compliant with some of the newer, stricter regulations in Europe (we’ve heard you, German friends).   It'll turn on when you need it (we have a new light sensor onboard) and always shut off on its own when you're done riding. No more burnt batteries!  Assistant lets you stay connected to what matters. With PeekDisplay, you can see who's texting, calling or trying to reach you through Messenger, WhatsApp, WeChat or Slack. Answering or not is up to you. Want to bike peacefully? Easy, just turn notifications off. Mother nature can call too: SmartHalo will warn you of incoming difficult weather conditions so you can pick up the pace.With PeekDisplay™ and gestures, you can do more with SmartHalo 2 without ever taking your phone out. You can swipe through your pre-defined Shortcuts you've set in the app. You can even assign Quick Touch sequences to trigger those shortcuts. Wanna head back home? Assign the ""Go To Home"" Shortcut to three taps. Riding in the city? Set the horn to one short tap. You can even open your connected garage door with a Shortcut.    A Redesigned App That Gets You Riding QuickerWe've redesigned the app from the ground up. Every feature is now grouped into cards, beautifully laid out on top of a map. Important functionalities are always reachable from your thumb to make it easier to navigate.  New Lines, Same Rugged DesignSmartHalo 2 is lighter, smaller and integrates more seamlessly with your bike. It has what we like to call a new ""comet"" like shape: it simply flows naturally with your bike's aerodynamics. As always, it is designed to withstand the elements. It'll resist rain, snow, mud, potholes. Bring it on.  A Battery That Goes on (Almost) ForeverWhat makes SmartHalo truly smart is the fact that you leave it on your bike at all times: it becomes one with it. This is made possible thanks to long battery life: under normal daily commuting usage, SmartHalo can go on for weeks between charges. It can also easily last the entirety of a long day trip. To charge, simply undock your device with your HaloKey™ and charge it with the included USB cable. A Device That Keeps Renewing ItselfOur backers from version 1 know what it feels like to wake up to a SmartHalo app update. Every season, we pushed new features that were requested from the community to the delight of our users. We don't plan to stop. With PeekDisplay™, your imagination is the only limit, so keep sending us your amazing ideas and we'll try to push them to a future software release!Tech Specs In the Box Timeline What SmartHalo 1 Users Say

The first partner cities with which the young company is already working successfully include the city of Leipzig, the city of Jena, as well as Graz and Styria.Risiken und HerausforderungenRisks and challenges, especially of an external nature, may arise especially in the current period. The biggest challenge, in view of the global shortage of goods and desynchronisation of supply chains as a result of the Corona actions, is keeping to the schedule. Due to the high interest in the Dashbike and the general shortage of goods, the delivery of the first Dashbikes is expected to start on August 2021 due to sometimes extremely long delivery times of the electronic components. Delivery will basically be made in the order in which orders are received. Super Early Bird orders will be given priority. As a precaution, we have already ordered the components in large quantities in spring and will probably receive them from June onwards in order to start production.Risiken und Herausforderungen, insbesondere externer Natur, können gerade in der aktuellen Zeit auftreten. Die größte Herausforderung ist mit Blick auf die weltweite Warenknappheit und Desynchronisation der Lieferketten in Folge der Corona-Maßnahmen die Einhaltung des Zeitplans. Aufgrund des hohen Interesses an der Dashbike und der allgemeinen Warenknappheit, beginnt die Auslieferung der ersten Dashbikes durch teilweise extrem lange Lieferzeiten der Elektronikkomponenten voraussichtlich ab August 2021. Die Auslieferung erfolgt grundsätzlich nach der Reihenfolge des Bestelleingangs. Super Early Bird-Bestellungen werden bevorzugt behandelt. Wir haben die Komponenten vorsorglich bereits im Frühjahr in hoher Stückzahl bestellt und werden diese voraussichtlich ab Juni erhalten, um die Produktion zu starten.Beständiges DesignQuality and durability through 100% German development and European production!

<h3>About Nipah</h3>

Scroll down to find out what makes SMOL so magical! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Because jackets are made to keep you warm, that’s exactly what SMOL does. It’s filled with a very cool-sounding insulation called THERMOLITE® T-Down Ecomade insulation. The name’s not that important, what matters is that it keeps the cold out and the heat in, while making you feel like you’re laying on soft fluffy clouds. ☁️ 
 
  So how warm does SMOL keep me? Whew, we're glad you asked! 
 The filling is eco friendly, made from recycled materials ♻️ that are 100% cruelty free and animal free. Because we believe there’s really no reason to harm animals for our own comfort. If you agree, SMOL is perfect for you. If you don’t, you’ll probably look for something else. That’s ok. We don’t judge (much). 
 Most jackets nowadays are made with goose or duck down and this comes at a much greater price than you're told.
 Through extensive research we learnt that animal cruelty is still very present even in facilities that say they provide responsibly sourced down. We are very happy to say that SMOL is 100% animal free and cruelty free and will always remain that way!  
 
 
 
 
 SMOL is reversible and comes in two colours that are impossible not to love: Black & Grey, Sage & Navy or Black & Navy. It adapts to your every need: you can change on the go and stay nimble wherever your next adventure takes you. 
 
 SMOL doesn’t do anything futuristic. But it is so versatile that you can choose to wear the vest, the hooded jacket or both (hint: that’s our favourite option). You can easily link them together, using the connecting zipper, and get a super warm winter jacket ☃️ in seconds. Autumn is our favourite season for the jacket, and the vest is great in spring or during chilly summer nights.  
 
 No matter how you choose to wear it, you can trust your SMOL is super packable and doesn’t weigh you down in your daily life or when you travel. It comes with a handy travel pouch that makes carrying it an absolute breeze. 
 
 You can wear SMOL as a vest, as a jacket or as a thick winter jacket. On one side, or on the other side. That’s 6 styles in 1 you can adapt to any occasion or season. Cool, right? 
 
 Wear SMOL to go places and do useful stuff! Like meeting up with friends, visiting grandma, helping mum with grocery shopping, commuting, going on a trip to the mountains, sightseeing in a new city or keeping warm on a plane. As you can imagine, the list is endless! 
 
 
When you speak, we listen! We’ve gone ahead and rethought completely how and where to position the logo, as well as its size. Check it out below!
 

 
The logo is now considerably smaller and will be positioned on the bottom seam of both the vest and jacket. It will be visible on both faces of SMOL, but in a much more discreet way.
 
 
 
 Making a winter jacket light and packable is no easy feat. Making it reversible as well is next level. But we made it our mission to deliver everything in one awesome jacket, just for you!  
 SMOL comes with the best quality zippers recommended for apparel. This means your SMOL will keep you warm for years to come.  A winter jacket without a hood is what nightmares are made of. We wouldn’t do that to you - we like you! So your SMOL jacket comes with an adjustable hood. The super cute and discreet drawstrings come to the rescue to keep your smarts warm and give you a great fit.  You don’t have to remember to get a scarf every time you leave the house. SMOL has a high collar that keeps you super snug even on cold windy days.  SMOL is wind resistant, so you’ll feel comfy and warm even if you live in the Windy City. It also comes with adjustable drawstrings for a tight fit and tight cuffs to really keep the cold out. 
 The outer fabric is treated to be water resistant and keep out the rain and moisture. But at the same time, your SMOL remains breathable and comfortable. 
 Your SMOL is machine washable using a cold water cycle. It's so easy to care for, even a kid could take this on.  
 
 
 
 We spent years researching the ideal number of pockets for a jacket. And we finally discovered it: two pockets - one either side, positioned roughly where your hands go. For 90 percent of your daily activities, do you really need much more? 
 But because SMOL is reversible and comes with a connectable jacket and vest, you can actually end up with a total of 8 deep and roomy pockets, 6 of which can be hidden. So you might actually call SMOL an anti-theft jacket, if you really want to brag about it to your friends. 
 
 
 
 
 
  You'll have ample time to choose your favourite colour and ideal size when we send out the pledge management surveys.
 
 This gives you maximum comfort and warmth while you're on the go getting shite done! 
 
  Yes, your eyes are not deceiving you, some overly rich person spent $120,000 on a banana duct-taped to a wall. Apparently it's ""art"", who knew ... But if a $1 banana and 10 cents of duct tape cost that much, then investing in a SMOL makes perfect sense! 
 We will plant a new tree for every SMOL jacket pre-ordered on Indiegogo. We don't shout about it 'cause it's just the right thing to do. Simple!  
 
 
 *SMOL Add ons will not incur any extra shipping.Want to get more SMOL Add-Ons for your loved ones? Awesome! You can easily select them in your BackerKit survey, the pledge management platform we use.You’ll be able to select however many other extra SMOL units you want, without any extra shipping fees on BackerKit. That’s also where you will be able to choose your gender, size and colour preferences for the SMOL units you have in your order.A very simple survey will be sent to you and you’ll be done with it in minutes. We haven't sent any yet, but we are working on sending out the very first batch of surveys very soon. Make sure to keep an eye on our Indiegogo Campaign Updates for all the details!

This jacket consists of silica aerogel, the highly resistant and lightweight material researched and developed by NASA to insulate spacesuits.  We’ll take you from the highest peak of Everest to the coldest land in the Nordics, and everywhere in between.  ""The Boreas Jacket pays serious attention to detail and consequently rewards its wearer with a high-performing and versatile jacket. The NASA-developed Aerogel offers warmth without compromising on weight; the thermometer prevents you from overheating in addition to getting cold; and the deep pockets will thaw cold hands or warm your phone battery. The jacket is designed for adventure, and I plan to take it on some!"" Josiah Skeats, josiahskeats.com 

""The manufacturing quality and attention to detail in producing the Boreas jacket is excellent. All the seams line up, stitching is uniform throughout. The outer material feels very smooth, somewhat slick, and soft.""Jeff Daum, Photojournalist 
No more bulky layers to stay warm! As thin as just two millimeters of foil, the aerogel filling will maintain your core temperature in any weather condition, ensuring complete comfort and protection for your next chilly adventure.  Aerogel is a synthetic material that is made up of 95-99% air. Extremely porous and very low in density, it boasts an incredibly low thermal conductivity, for an extraordinary insulating capability that exceeds even the warmest outdoor apparel.  Ultra-thin and ultra-light, the SiO2 aerogel composite material lays underneath your Boreas, allowing you to achieve outstanding heat retention in environments as cold as-40 °C/-40°F. To test the Boreas, we sprayed it with -196 °C (-320.8) °F liquid nitrogen. After 60 seconds, its internal temperature remained at 28 °C (82.4 °F)!  Second test. We wrapped a piece of raw meat in a 1mm cut of aerogel, then soaked it in liquid nitrogen for 20 seconds.  The meat comes out of the aerogel wrap still springy and incredibly fresh!   The Boreas is designed to take you anywhere, in almost any weather condition. Dive with it underwater up to 100 meters — the Boreas will never let you down! The Boreas is ready to take you through the most comfortable, safest, and definitely the driest outdoor adventure you have ever experienced.  Essential safety comes first. From the hood to the ribbed waistband, and down to the cuffs—every inch of the Boreas is 100% resistant to flames and ignition.  Coffee spills and grease stains will no longer ruin your day. The Boreas all-round resistance to stains will keep dirt away from your clothes, and from the fun!  Not enough? Well, we made the Boreas resistant to wrinkles and creases, too! It is a jacket designed to keep you comfortable and warm in any condition, at any time.  So much with so little—Only 660 grams of weight for its S size, lighter than two cans of soda, this is all you need to feel comfortable, warm, and protected.  The Boreas interior is fully covered with a film of the nano-silver coating.Widely known for their anti-bacterial properties, the silver nanoparticles nested into the fabric can also enable the lining layer to reflect near-infrared wavelengths back toward your skin, maintaining the temperature inside the jacket while preventing the loss of body heat.   In addition to keeping the heat within, the Boreas allows you to breathe as you wear it. Specially designed to preserve a comfortable fit, it effectively prevents your body from overheating or sweating.  The battery-free thermometer, flexible and embedded inside the jacket, will help you monitor your body temperature anytime and anywhere, letting you explore safely and with total peace of mind.  The Boreas is much more than just a warm jacket! It is by far the most functional outdoor garment ever designed.   Lost your gloves? The two aerogel-filled pockets, spacious and conveniently designed on the sides of your jacket, will keep your hands warm and comfortable even in the coldest winter conditions.  With these, plus as many as six added invisible pockets ready to store your everything, the Boreas will take you all equipped towards your next, thrilling adventure.  The double-layer curved cuffs, featuring blunt hook-and-loop straps to prevent abrasion damages and annoying pilling on clothes, will provide you with total freedom of wrist movement while engaged in sports activities or driving. The inner layer built-in bands, soft and elastic, fit perfectly on your wrist for added comfort and heat retention.  The Boreas comes with YKK zippers. Entirely made in Japan, YKK zippers are renowned for being highly durable and completely waterproof, preserving a perfect functionality even underwater.  Every built-in detail of the Boreas has been created to deliver the most fashionable, practical, and ultimately, the warmest outdoor garment ever designed.   It's always the same story—when packing for a trip, your bulky winter clothes will take up too much room in your suitcase.

</div></div>","Purisoo is a reusable, portable, premium-design purification water bottle that protects you and your family from consuming contaminated water while outdoor trekking, traveling, and during disasters. With manual pumping, almost any fresh water source can be purified and filtered into clean, safe drinking water. Even if you find a source of outdoor water – river/stream water, lake water, tap water at a camp ground – it’s not necessarily safe to drink. Contamination from wildlife, including protozoa and parasites in the water can cause sickness or incapacitation at the most inopportune time. Purisoo purifies and filters water to keep you safe.Travel to foreign places, especially developing countries, offers some risks when it comes to drinking the tap water. No need to take a chance. When you travel, pack a Purisoo!Purisoo's replaceable filters can process up to 1,000 Liters. That's the equivalent of 2,000 bottles of water - so feel free to share your purified water. Prepare for emergency situations such as typhoons, earthquakes, fire and other disasters, natural or manmade. While there may be plenty of water, it may not be drinkable. Even if not fatal, water contaminated with bacteria and/or particulates, when consumed, can make one ill. Add the included tube for hard to reach water sources.Purisoo is part pumping technology - purify even from a shallow water source. As an all-in-one purification/filter pump system and water bottle, Purisoo solves issues from which other portable water purifiers suffer.
Your face does not need to be close to contaminated water.
Does not store contaminated water.
Has its own chamber to store purifed water.
  
This is a video demonstrating an earlier prototype.


  Purisoo pulls contaminated water through its filter/purifier and deposits the clean/purified results into the drinking reservoir.  Contaminated water never enters the clean chamber.

After a lot of discussion, they said yes, and a collaboration was born. Just like the original Malcolm Fontier bags, we are only using modern, durable, technical materials that are animal-friendly and have the lowest possible environmental impact. We’ve also developed relationships with our manufacturing partners and suppliers to ensure that our bags are produced under safe, fair, legal, and humane working conditions. Leading by example: The Pakt One breaks from the norm by avoiding all plastic packaging. By doing so, the Pakt One serves as a case study in our collaboration with SeaHive. The new collective, also started by Malcolm, tackles the problem of plastic waste in our oceans through design, technology, and media savvy. The Pakt One will be shipped bearing the SeaHive Seal, which means 100% plastic-free packaging: no bubble wrap, no plastic bags, no air pillows, no Styrofoam (and no wrap rage). Most importantly, it means no extra plastic to land in the ocean.  Now that we have a successfully funded the project and thousands of customers eager to receive their Pakt One, our team and partners are pushing full speed ahead with our larger production order. Ensuring a product of the highest quality, produced in facilities and with materials that meet our high ethical standards, and delivering on time are our top priorities.While it is possible these days for a brand to develop and manufacture products without ever traveling to their manufacturers, it’s not the way to get the best product. We also knew seeing everything with our own eyes was the only way to truly guarantee that all of the suppliers and factories were ones that we could be proud of. Basically, we want to know that we would have no problem with any of our backers walking in and seeing everything for themselves. We’re beyond satisfied with everything we saw and everyone we worked with.See more production updates and photos from our trip to our manufacturing facility in Vietnam here. The team here at Pakt is committed to being environmentally conscious, both as entrepreneurs and consumers. We take producing products -- and the purchasing of them -- very seriously, because the last thing we want to do is add more unnecessary stuff to the world. We have taken incredible care to create a product that we believe is useful, beautiful, and necessary, and we ask you to, like us, carefully consider every purchase you make, this one included! Below both Malcolm and Joshua share their thoughts on the subject.Malcolm Fontier: ""I worked as a design consultant for years and helped bring all kinds of products to market. I started to feel that the world didn’t need most of these products, and I didn’t feel good about being part of the machine that cranks out more just to make a buck. After I stopped consulting, my wife and I launched our own line of bags because of our desire to create products that meant more to people and actually added value to their lives, and to be able to ensure both social and environmental responsibility throughout the process. When the opportunity to relaunch our popular Getaway bag as a collaboration with The Minimalists arose, I actually hesitated for months because I didn’t want to detour from the environmental venture, SeaHive, that I had started. After many discussions with Josh and Ryan it became clear we were totally aligned in our outlooks and that we could actually do more good by pursuing the opportunity. It’s been an amazing experience working with like-minded friends to deliver a product so many people have been asking for. On top of all that, if we succeed we will also be able to help raise the visibility of SeaHive! Win, win.""Joshua Fields Millburn: ""The Minimalists aren’t opposed to physical goods—we’re against impulsive consumption—and this bag was the opposite of impulse for me. It was intentional. As a minimalist, everything I own serves a purpose or brings me joy, and Malcolm’s bag has added immense value to my life over the years—more value than any other item."" This is not the first bag we’ve made. Malcolm Fontier’s line of travel bags and accessories ran from 2007-2012, and he produced thousands of items during that period. We've put together a strong supply chain, from the materials suppliers to manufacturers to shipping and fulfillment partners, and have full confidence that we can deliver a bag you’ll be proud to carry for years to come.Once our campaign is completed and funded, we are ready to go straight into purchasing all the materials from our suppliers and then into production with our manufacturer. We will keep our backers updated throughout the process of the campaign and production to ensure that we deliver the Pakt One on time.A note on delivery date: As with any manufactured good, delays can happen -- a typhoon can hit, or a pallet can get stuck in a shipyard. We’ve padded our schedule to accommodate some changes, but will let our backers know immediately if we foresee any updates to the timeline for delivery.We are so confident you’ll love the Pakt One that we guarantee it! When you receive your bag(s), if you’re not 100% satisfied with the design or quality simply send it back for a full refund of the purchase price (shipping and handling fees are non-refundable). We’re pretty sure you’ll be more excited to plan a trip than return it though!Please note that contributors are responsible for any taxes and duties related to their shipping country.",47.0,2,"4 Campaigns

This means nothing gets in your way - and space for your face. The whole system is not complete, however, until you use our ""Scionn"" Tabs, located at the side of the hammock to guy out to the ground and ensure optimum flat-lay positioning.  You Mean There's A BIGGER Version?Now you have the option of a Koala MAXX. Built for two people or one good-almighty-stretch.   
  It's super easy to transform into MultiPosition's. Koala V2 was designed around these positions. No more material poking into the back of your knee. No way.  Backyard Bound or Mountain Mover?Doesn't matter. Either or. Your Koala's perfect for both and can easily move between the hillside or the homestead. Your Hammock- Your Way.That's right- your pockets move.Specialised pockets for:
Clothes
LARGE Beer
Phone (Waterproof)
Books and Tablets (Waterproof)
Other Valuables (Waterproof)
Snacks
AND.. A hidden pocket, for anything you're scared that people will steal or see. (The Hasselhoff calendar you've been stowing away isn't that embarrassing)   More Gear Storage?Included in all full-kits, your mini under-hammock is perfect for keeping boots and bags safe and dry.   Not Getting A Regular Escape? You Will Now. Your Koala will provide everything you need for a quick and easy outdoors escape. Koala's Quick and Easy Setup Everywhere You Go, Always Take Koala With You.(We hope you sang that too.)Bring your Koala everywhere, it packs up small into a convenient stuff sack.It's smaller than a loaf of bread.And yes- it's pretty great.     Reflective Tarp = Perfect Camping ConditionsYour tarp is aluminized on one side, so it can keep you warm or cool.Face the reflective side out for hot weather or keep it in for colder times. 360 Degree Bug MeshGoodbye Critters- Hello Itch-Free Hammocking!    Better, Better, Better.The big stuff.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">MANUFACTURING</h2>
<p>The production Polymule will be manufactured using various molding technologies including rotational and compression molding. The final products will be highly durable, aesthetically pleasing, and functional.  We are currently working with manufacturers here in the USA to ensure the best quality possible.  Some minor design changes may be necessary to efficiently mold the handcart.  Major changes are not anticipated.  Any change whatsoever will be discussed with our backers.  Backers will be part of the decision making process and we will weigh all suggestions carefully. We pledge not to cut corners. <strong>We are in this for the long-haul.</strong></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>HOW DOES THIS WORK?</strong></h2>
<p>This is a ""Fixed Funding"" campaign AKA ""all-or-nothing"".  Indiegogo will charge your card immediately at checkout, however, if we do not reach our funding goal by the end of our campaign, <u>Indiegogo will refund you in full within 5-7 days</u>.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">INDIEGOGO: A WIN-WIN</h2>
<p>Indiegogo is a ""crowdfunding"" platform that is used to help jump-start products and companies. In our case, it's helping us generate <u>PRE-ORDERS</u> to move the Polymule from prototype to production.  <i>THIS IS A WIN - WIN...in exchange for your help, we are offering a limited-time 30% OFF our product line-up. </i></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>Once successfully funded, there will be plenty of tasks.  We will work tirelessly to stay on track with our 'timeline' and plan to bring the Polymule to our backers according to their order's ship date.  It is quite possible that we will ship before our stated delivery dates.  That being said, putting a time-frame on order fulfillment is an inexact science.</p>
<p>We hope you will join us for the ride and we promise to keep you informed!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/><i>The Polymule Team</i></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FREQUENTLY ASKED</h2>
<p><strong>Are custom orders / perks possible?</strong><br/>We can accommodate custom orders ONLY IF there is interest in purchasing three or more Polymule units.  Once arrangements are made, we will send you a ""secret link"".  Your purchase will be made through INDIEGOGO.  <u>Serious inquiries only.</u>  Please contact ----&gt; support@polymule.com</p>
<p><strong>When will shipping start?</strong><br/>Polymule will begin shipping in August 2018 and will continue until all orders are fulfilled. Orders will be shipped sequentially, with early backers receiving their orders first.</p>
<p><strong>What are the shipping costs?</strong><br/>There is a flat $98 shipping cost for each Polymule unit.  Add-on kits ship free with a corresponding Polymule purchase.  If you have questions or concerns about shipping, please contact us directly  ----&gt;  support@polymule.com</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522174795/u8yrdfh5bqgnkjalqaa7.svg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why are your perks limited?</strong><br/>We have intentionally limited the amount of backers for all of our 'perks'.  If you don't see the perk you wanted, check again later.  New perks will become available with later delivery dates to ensure we can meet growing production and logistical demands.</p>
<p><strong>Which countries will Polymule ship to?</strong><br/>We offer shipping worldwide. For customers not located in the USA, please contact us ----&gt; support@polymule.com.  We will calculate shipping costs and provide you with a special link to order on Indiegogo.</p>
<p><strong>What are your return / refund policies?</strong><br/>Returns and refunds are processed on a case-by-case basis.  At some point we will need to lock refunds in order to go into production &amp; fulfillment.  We will not be able to refund orders once they've shipped.  In the unlikely event that your product is defective and you would like to make a warranty claim please contact us ----&gt; support@polymule.com</p>
<p><strong>What is the warranty period?</strong><br/>The vast majority of wheelbarrows, garden carts, and yard carts offer 90 day warranties.  We offer a 5-year limited warranty even though we expect our product to become a family heirloom. Full warranty details forthcoming.</p>
<p><strong>I have questions or concerns, who do I contact?</strong><br/>If you have already ordered a perk we recommend you contact us directly through Indiegogo by scrolling to the top of the page and selecting ""ask a question"" under 'Project Owner'.  For all other inquiries please email ----&gt;  support@polymule.com</p>
<p><strong>How will the polymer hold up in extreme cold?</strong><br/>The polymer we will be using is known in the engineering world for its sub-zero impact resistance. Some formulations of this polymer are used in military vehicle armor systems and bullet-proof vests. It's insanely tough...</p>
<p><strong>How will the polymer hold up in UV radiation?</strong><br/>Decades. The formulation we will be using is UV stabilized. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://polymule.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/BEST.gif"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How does the UPHILL Assist work?</strong><br/>The UPHILL Assist system is integrated directly into the struts.  A good analogy is a socket wrench.  Flipping a switch prevents travel in one direction using a 'gear' and 'pawl' mechanism. This system makes going uphill MUCH safer and easier. If you need to adjust your footing, your grip, or take a rest, you don't need to keep constant force on the handle, as the cart will not roll backward.</p>
<p><strong>Can the All-Weather Cover be used when the Polymule is in cargo carrier mode?</strong><br/>Though durable, the All-Weather Cover is not built to be on the highway. We recommend using a common cargo net and tie downs to secure loads in the Polymule when it is being used as a cargo carrier.</p>
<p><strong>As a Cargo Carrier, what speeds are possible and how much weight can be placed inside?</strong><br/>In cargo carrier mode, the Polymule is capable of normal highway speeds when used with our Roof Rack Kit AND a standard factory roof rack system.  Weight capacity is limited to the maximum weight rating of your vehicles roof rack system.</p>
<p><strong>What material will the All-Weather-Cover be made out of?</strong><br/>Durable UV resistant polyester rip-stop...NOT nylon.</p>
<p><strong>What real-world testing has been done on the Polymule?</strong><br/>We spent hundreds of hours torture testing an early prototype.  We abused it in nearly every way imaginable... including drop testing, throwing rocks and logs AT and IN it, hauling it over ridiculously large boulders, dredge pilings, through rivers, flipping it upside down, pulling it up steep grades, etc.  Needless to say, we are willing to bet the Polymule can handle anything you throw at it... that's why we're offering an INSANE five-year warranty (20x the industry standard).</p>

The production Polymule will be manufactured using various molding technologies including rotational and compression molding. The final products will be highly durable, aesthetically pleasing, and functional.  We are currently working with manufacturers here in the USA to ensure the best quality possible.  Some minor design changes may be necessary to efficiently mold the handcart.  Major changes are not anticipated.  Any change whatsoever will be discussed with our backers.  Backers will be part of the decision making process and we will weigh all suggestions carefully. We pledge not to cut corners. We are in this for the long-haul.

 
HOW DOES THIS WORK?
This is a ""Fixed Funding"" campaign AKA ""all-or-nothing"".  Indiegogo will charge your card immediately at checkout, however, if we do not reach our funding goal by the end of our campaign, Indiegogo will refund you in full within 5-7 days.
 

INDIEGOGO: A WIN-WIN
Indiegogo is a ""crowdfunding"" platform that is used to help jump-start products and companies. In our case, it's helping us generate PRE-ORDERS to move the Polymule from prototype to production.  THIS IS A WIN - WIN...in exchange for your help, we are offering a limited-time 30% OFF our product line-up. 
 

RISKS & CHALLENGES
Once successfully funded, there will be plenty of tasks.  We will work tirelessly to stay on track with our 'timeline' and plan to bring the Polymule to our backers according to their order's ship date.  It is quite possible that we will ship before our stated delivery dates.  That being said, putting a time-frame on order fulfillment is an inexact science.
We hope you will join us for the ride and we promise to keep you informed!
Sincerely,The Polymule Team
 
FREQUENTLY ASKED
Are custom orders / perks possible?We can accommodate custom orders ONLY IF there is interest in purchasing three or more Polymule units.  Once arrangements are made, we will send you a ""secret link"".  Your purchase will be made through INDIEGOGO.  Serious inquiries only.  Please contact ----> support@polymule.com
When will shipping start?Polymule will begin shipping in August 2018 and will continue until all orders are fulfilled. Orders will be shipped sequentially, with early backers receiving their orders first.
What are the shipping costs?There is a flat $98 shipping cost for each Polymule unit.  Add-on kits ship free with a corresponding Polymule purchase.  If you have questions or concerns about shipping, please contact us directly  ---->  support@polymule.com

Why are your perks limited?We have intentionally limited the amount of backers for all of our 'perks'.  If you don't see the perk you wanted, check again later.  New perks will become available with later delivery dates to ensure we can meet growing production and logistical demands.
Which countries will Polymule ship to?We offer shipping worldwide. For customers not located in the USA, please contact us ----> support@polymule.com.  We will calculate shipping costs and provide you with a special link to order on Indiegogo.
What are your return / refund policies?Returns and refunds are processed on a case-by-case basis.  At some point we will need to lock refunds in order to go into production & fulfillment.  We will not be able to refund orders once they've shipped.  In the unlikely event that your product is defective and you would like to make a warranty claim please contact us ----> support@polymule.com
What is the warranty period?The vast majority of wheelbarrows, garden carts, and yard carts offer 90 day warranties.  We offer a 5-year limited warranty even though we expect our product to become a family heirloom. Full warranty details forthcoming.
I have questions or concerns, who do I contact?If you have already ordered a perk we recommend you contact us directly through Indiegogo by scrolling to the top of the page and selecting ""ask a question"" under 'Project Owner'.  For all other inquiries please email ---->  support@polymule.com
How will the polymer hold up in extreme cold?The polymer we will be using is known in the engineering world for its sub-zero impact resistance. Some formulations of this polymer are used in military vehicle armor systems and bullet-proof vests. It's insanely tough...
How will the polymer hold up in UV radiation?Decades. The formulation we will be using is UV stabilized. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
How does the UPHILL Assist work?The UPHILL Assist system is integrated directly into the struts.  A good analogy is a socket wrench.  Flipping a switch prevents travel in one direction using a 'gear' and 'pawl' mechanism. This system makes going uphill MUCH safer and easier. If you need to adjust your footing, your grip, or take a rest, you don't need to keep constant force on the handle, as the cart will not roll backward.
Can the All-Weather Cover be used when the Polymule is in cargo carrier mode?Though durable, the All-Weather Cover is not built to be on the highway. We recommend using a common cargo net and tie downs to secure loads in the Polymule when it is being used as a cargo carrier.
As a Cargo Carrier, what speeds are possible and how much weight can be placed inside?In cargo carrier mode, the Polymule is capable of normal highway speeds when used with our Roof Rack Kit AND a standard factory roof rack system.  Weight capacity is limited to the maximum weight rating of your vehicles roof rack system.
What material will the All-Weather-Cover be made out of?Durable UV resistant polyester rip-stop...NOT nylon.
What real-world testing has been done on the Polymule?We spent hundreds of hours torture testing an early prototype.  We abused it in nearly every way imaginable... including drop testing, throwing rocks and logs AT and IN it, hauling it over ridiculously large boulders, dredge pilings, through rivers, flipping it upside down, pulling it up steep grades, etc.  Needless to say, we are willing to bet the Polymule can handle anything you throw at it... that's why we're offering an INSANE five-year warranty (20x the industry standard).

<p>We’re just gonna say it: <strong><span>Your puffy jacket sucks.</span></strong></p>
<p>Your insulated jacket uses outdated technology that’s over 80 years old. Its fabrics trap humidity and sweat, causing you to overheat when active and leaving you wet and cold when you stop. The stitching used to keep the antiquated insulation in place prevents sufficient weather protection. Additionally, its style and colors look out of place in urban settings, resulting in a closet full of jackets you rarely use.</p>
<p>Welcome to the 21st century. The AirLoft Jacket is the next generation of insulated jacket. Built from the fiber up by chemists and tested by athletes, the AirLoft Jacket is designed to solve all the performance issues of other insulated jackets with a style you can wear anywhere, no matter the weather, season, or occasion.

Welcome to the 21st century. The AirLoft Jacket is the next generation of insulated jacket. Built from the fiber up by chemists and tested by athletes, the AirLoft Jacket is designed to solve all the performance issues of other insulated jackets with a style you can wear anywhere, no matter the weather, season, or occasion. This jacket is temperature regulating, breathable, stain-proof, water resistant, durable, packable, and versatile. Providing ultimate freedom, you’ll forget you’re wearing it.   
 
The AirLoft Jacket is packed full of features and meticulously crafted with four zip pockets, a cinch hood, drawstring waist, elastic cuffs, and a packable stuff pocket. The modern cut and tailored silhouette ensure freedom of movement and a flattering fit, making the AirLoft Jacket a staple you can wear in both urban and outdoor environments.   
 
 



 
 




 
When we set out to build a jacket as dynamic as your daily life, we knew we had to start from the fiber up. Our AirLoft™ technology combines Toray’s new 3DeFX+® hollow-core, 360-degree stretch insulation with Primeflex® 4-way stretch, weather-resistant exterior fabric. AirLoft™ is built to breathe freely, move with the body, dry quickly, and keep you warm even in the wettest conditions. AirLoft™ is ready for the broadest temperature ranges and unrestricted movement. The AirLoft™ system is Bluesign approved and vegan for a more sustainable world.

 Let's make one thing clear - this is NOT just an outdoor jacket! The AirLoft Jacket has been meticulously designed and crafted from the yarn level up to perform, look great, and feel great in every scenario, no matter the weather or occasion. Its matte fabric, tailored fit, and lack of exterior branding make it as at home in the office as it is in the outdoors.



 

 The AirLoft Jacket is designed and sized for a flattering and slimming, yet comfortable fit. Please refer to the size chart for specific garment measurements by size.
Active Fit: The flattering, tailored fit is neither tight nor relaxed. Active-fitting technical garments may be worn alone, over mid-layers, or under a shell.

*Please note: The size chart refers to the actual garment measurements of the product. In order to get the best fit, the garment measurements should be 1-2"" LARGER than your body measurements to allow for the ""wrap"" of the fabric.

If you have any questions about sizing and fit, please send us a note at help@westernrise.com.


When necessary, wash with like colors and mild detergent on cold. Line dry or tumble dry low. Do not use bleach or fabric softener, as these chemicals will damage coloring and water resistance.
Reactivating Water Resistance: Over time, the water resistance may appear to wear down. Reactivate it with a quick tumble in the dryer on low or by applying a tech wash.
Avoid oils and grease, as they will permanently damage the water repellent treatment and possibly stain the piece.
 


We work with a vertically-integrated manufacturer that provides a fully transparent and ethical supply chain from the yarn to the finished jacket. They have decades of experience working with performance fabrics at the highest standards, including Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP) standards and Bluesign.

Our small team has been working years to bring this project to you. We know you will love it as much as we do.


We believe it is not just our responsibility but our obligation to protect the world we are part of and enjoy. This belief affects everything we do, from how we choose fabrics to who we support. So, we speak up and put our money where our mouth is.

The Pakt Coffee Kit is our second product, and we’ll be releasing our third, a travel backpack, this fall. All Pakt product packaging is 100% plastic-free and designed by our sister company, SeaHive, where we fight the huge environmental issue caused by plastic product packaging, and other ocean conservation efforts.We believe that the only truly “sustainable” product development is none at all. But since that option isn’t compatible with the lives we lead and the world we live in, we’re going with the next best thing: producing products as responsibly as possible, building them to last, and designing them to be versatile so that the buyer can minimize the number of products they need.We designed the Pakt Coffee Kit to have a 10-20 year lifespan or longer, kind of like the toaster your grandparents received as a wedding gift and are still using. One of the key ways we’ve ensured a long lifespan for The Kit is by making it serviceable -- so if something goes wrong, we can fix it or replace any broken parts so you don’t have to throw it out. We’ve only used premium, durable materials throughout production to ensure your coffee’s flavor isn’t affected by any cheap materials and that your kit lasts a very long time. The kettle, mug, and grounds container are made largely of high grade stainless steel and silicone, and we’ve made minimal use of plastic except for a few lids and things that never touch your beverageWe are working with a U.S.-owned and operated manufacturing partner that has strong standards for ethical practices for the factories that produce its goods. With operations in both the U.S. and Asia, our partner has a wealth of experience supporting startups and other crowdfunding companies with similar commitments to responsible production. Because the Pakt Coffee Kit is a very compact product, we’ve kept the packaging accordingly minimal. This gives us the ability to fit more kits into fewer shipping containers to keep our carbon footprint as low as possible when transporting and storing kits.Our founder, Malcolm, and Impel’s founder, Matt, originally met through motorcycling but immediately knew they needed to work together. Six years later, Impel has become our rockstar industrial design partners. It helps that their team’s collective level of coffee geekery is unrivaled!Platform88 has been the best manufacturing partner a fast-moving company like ours could ask for. They have extensive experience working with startups and crowdfunding campaigns to engineer, manufacture, and scale innovative consumer products.This is not our first crowdfunding campaign. The Pakt team has put together a strong supply chain, from materials suppliers to manufacturers to shipping and fulfillment partners.As noted above, we’ve been working on creating this product for more than a year, and have already completed the design and development and have moved on to tooling, the process of creating all the molds, fixtures, and processes needed for mass production.Once our campaign is completed and funded, we are ready to go straight into purchasing all the materials from our suppliers and into production with our manufacturer. We will keep our backers updated throughout the process of the campaign and production to ensure that we deliver the Pakt Coffee Kit on schedule.As with any manufactured good, delays can happen -- a typhoon can hit, or a pallet can get stuck in a shipyard. We’ve padded our schedule to accommodate some changes, but will let our backers know immediately if we foresee any updates to the timeline for delivery.",57.0,1,"4 Campaigns

It crafts beverages from coffee to cocktails, yet simple enough to be used as an everyday water bottle.


 

 

The All-Day Adventure Flask combines the best functionality of beverage making into one simple bottle built for the campground, but still kitchen counter cool.
 

 


Our innovative insulated lid inverts so you can make pour-over wherever, whenever.
 
 
 
The blade gasket on the strainer creates a firm fit to prevent it from tipping over.
 

 


 
Celebrate the summit with the only cocktail shaker built for the wild.
 
 
 Fill with your favorite octane for post-pow-day party sessions. Don't forget to hug the DD.  Aerate, filter, chill, & leave the glass at home.  Mellow the mood with a green tea or gameface with some sweet sweet Yerba Maté.   Pour a cup for the universe or a hypothetical someone else.   Make dawn patrol better. By better, we mean caffeinated.  The flask's oversized steel filter lets you make super strong cold brew on the go.   Spice up your life with a little infusion of flavor to your H2O.   With infused water you're flying high through the clouds on a magic carpet trying to find your big blue genie friend.

<h2>THE TOT-2-TEN TRAVEL BED</h2>
<h2>by BUNDLE BEDS</h2>
<h3>The Ultimate Kid’s Travel Bed</h3>
<p>Whether it's staying over at a friend’s house, trying out a family festival, staying away for the weekend or camping for the first time, Bundle Beds has always been about helping you say yes to everyday adventures. The Tot-2-Ten Travel Bed is the newest addition to the Bundle Family. It takes all the same premium features of our Classic Beds and rolls them into a more compact, lighter weight design with added child-focused details. The result is a kids’ travel bed that provides a familiar sleep space – safe, secure and snug – for wherever their adventures take them. It's their own bed away from home. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615648793/aekcir3loffsmhdgkado.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Our Story…</h3>
<p>Born from a love of travelling, camping &amp; a great night's sleep, Bundle Beds was founded in 2016 by Lucy Bartlett. Over 3000 <a href=""https://www.bundlebeds.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bundle Beds</a> have been sold since they launched,  providing great nights of sleep on adventures across the globe. We've won awards, for both design, including the top Junior Design award and customer service. In recognition of our 4.7/5 star average we have been awarded the Gold Trusted Service Award by Feefo.</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.feefo.com/en-GB/reviews/bundle-beds?withMedia=false&amp;timeFrame=YEAR&amp;displayFeedbackType=PRODUCT&amp;productScores=5"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615649798/rvw8xaa0zu4excqgeqxq.png"" src=""""/></a></p>
<p>Shortly after the launch of Bundle Beds, came the birth of her two boys, Arthur &amp; Dougal. Lucy was then joined by her brother Rob, also a parent to two boys. Both of them were sick of sleepless nights when travelling, or the excessive kit required when heading away for the weekend. The two of them put their heads together and struck parenting gold with <strong>the Tot 2 Ten Bundle Bed!</strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615713331/yjam7wf8vsqnfszm07la.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>As a parent planning a family trip - whether it be an international expedition or a weekend away with the grandparents - you face an awkward in-between stage when your baby is too big for a travel cot but not quite ready for an adult bed. Do you opt for a squeaky airbed; a bulky set of pillows they roll off of; or do you let them hop in with you and risk a midnight elbow to the chin?</p>
<p>The Tot-2-Ten Bundle Bed solves this dilemma and helps you all sleep soundly wherever you decide to go. It has everything you need for the kids to have a great night’s sleep.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615648851/mzludwbaxcmmatcxtyff.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Simply unclip, unroll, unzip and their bed is ready for them to sleep well.</p>

<h3>Why are we crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>To get a new product off the ground, with all materials ordered in sufficient quantities to make them financially viable, requires significant upfront investment. As a small business, this is a near impossible challenge  – especially with the added complexities of the pandemic – so we’re crowdfunding to make the Tot-2-Ten Bundle Bed happen!</p>

<p>Our initial Kickstarter campaign reached it’s goal within the first 48hours of launching, we raised nearly three times our initial target and it enabled us to roll out our product across the globe.

<h3>Questions &amp; Answers.</h3>
<p>As travel-loving parents to under-fives, we designed the Tot-2-Ten Bundle Bed as the answer to questions we asked ourselves ... <i>(at 4am on our less successful holidays!)</i></p>
<h3>WILL MY TODDLER SLEEP IF WE GO CAMPING?!</h3>
<p><strong>Yes! </strong>(Well, we can certainly improve the chances.)</p>
<p><strong>A familiar sleep space: </strong>with a proper duvet and jersey cotton sheets included, the Tot-2-Ten is your child's bed away from home - safe, secure, familiar. Unlike a sleeping bag, which looks and feels very different, this is an easy transition from a bed at home, to sleeping away – and then back again. You can even set-up a living-room campsite for some sleeping practice beforehand!</p>
<p><strong>Cosy and comfortable:</strong> an integrated self-inflating mattress ensures your toddler is properly cushioned from the floor, without the rustling and squeaking that accompanies an airbed. Plus, the Tot-2-Ten is much warmer to sleep on and, with an additional insulating layer, helps protect them from the cold ground.</p>
<p><strong>Contain a wriggly sleeper: </strong>prevent your toddler from waking up sprawled on the freezing floor with inflatable, cotton-covered, safety bumpers. ﻿﻿Using the handy buttons at the bottom of the bed, you can keep their duvet in place too.</p>

<h3>CAN HOLIDAYING WITH KIDS, BE A HOLIDAY FOR ME TOO?!</h3>
<p><strong>Yes!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simple to set-up and clear away: </strong>unclip, unroll, unzip and the Tot-2-Ten travel bed is ready! Super easy for half-asleep parents to roll out in the middle of the night. Then roll and clip it back up again for a neat, tidy, and quick getaway.</p>
<p><strong>No pumping or popping: </strong>the mattress is self-inflating foam, so no need for a pump or the concern about a deflating airbed.</p>
<p><strong>Accidents and spills are hassle-free: </strong>with its own removable and washable waterproof sheet the bed stays dry and the night stays comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Cost-saving: </strong>when staying at a hotel or B&amp;B, an extra kid’s bed can mean extra cost. Bring your own, and you’ve saved on the holiday already!</p>
<p><strong>Peace of mind: </strong>with a Tot-2-Ten you can be certain that the bed your toddler sleeps in, wherever you are, comes up to your hygiene and safety standards.</p>

<h3>JUST HOW MUCH STUFF DO I NEED FOR A HOLIDAY WITH A TODDLER?!</h3>
<p><strong>Probably less than you think but, inevitably, never what you have.</strong> Bring a Tot-2-Ten Travel Bed and at least sleeping is sorted!       </p>
<p><strong>The all-in-one toddler sleep solution:</strong> with a Bundle Bed you don’t need to think about the sleeping mat, then the sheets, then the duvet and pillow. It’s all included – grab your Bundle Bed and you’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>Less of “don’t forget the…”: </strong>there’s always a few added considerations with younger children, but you won’t forget the bed safety rails, or the waterproof sheet, as they’re all rolled up in the bundle too – you can even pop an extra blanket, or a favourite cuddly toy, in there as well.</p>
<p><strong>One neat bundle:</strong> rather than stuffing roll mats and bed linen into the back of the car, the Tot-2-Ten is a convenient bundle protected by a waterproof outer layer – so a drop in a muddy puddle won’t spoil the trip!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615482026/psncw08aypm4pegfz5gu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>WILL MY KIDS HAVE OUTGROWN IT BY NEXT YEAR?!</h3>
<p><strong>No! </strong>This is a kids' travel bed that LASTS!</p>
<p><strong>Playful, but not ‘babyish’: </strong>at 165cm long (nearly 20% longer than a standard toddler bed) and in fun designs, these are portable beds that will take your child from the first family camping holiday, to the first sleepover, to the first school residential trip. The safety bumpers and waterproof sheets are easily removed when no longer needed.</p>
<p><strong>10-year mattress guarantee: </strong>as with all our Bundle Beds, if something goes wrong with the self-inflating mattress within 10 years, we'll replace it for free.</p>
<p><strong>Premium materials: </strong>we use the same high-quality components in the Tot-2-Ten as we do in the Classic Bundle Bed so it looks and feels amazing but, more importantly, it’s durable. The buckles won’t snap; the zips won’t stick; and you won’t be replacing popped air mattresses year after year.</p>
<p><strong>The perfect hand-me-down: </strong>when your child does move on to a Classic Bundle Bed, we want you to be proud to pass the Tot-2-Ten onto siblings or another family. We’re making it to last, not earmarking it for landfill.  </p>

by BUNDLE BEDS
The Ultimate Kid’s Travel Bed
Whether it's staying over at a friend’s house, trying out a family festival, staying away for the weekend or camping for the first time, Bundle Beds has always been about helping you say yes to everyday adventures. The Tot-2-Ten Travel Bed is the newest addition to the Bundle Family. It takes all the same premium features of our Classic Beds and rolls them into a more compact, lighter weight design with added child-focused details. The result is a kids’ travel bed that provides a familiar sleep space – safe, secure and snug – for wherever their adventures take them. It's their own bed away from home. 

Our Story…
Born from a love of travelling, camping & a great night's sleep, Bundle Beds was founded in 2016 by Lucy Bartlett. Over 3000 Bundle Beds have been sold since they launched,  providing great nights of sleep on adventures across the globe. We've won awards, for both design, including the top Junior Design award and customer service. In recognition of our 4.7/5 star average we have been awarded the Gold Trusted Service Award by Feefo.

Shortly after the launch of Bundle Beds, came the birth of her two boys, Arthur & Dougal. Lucy was then joined by her brother Rob, also a parent to two boys. Both of them were sick of sleepless nights when travelling, or the excessive kit required when heading away for the weekend. The two of them put their heads together and struck parenting gold with the Tot 2 Ten Bundle Bed!
What is it?
As a parent planning a family trip - whether it be an international expedition or a weekend away with the grandparents - you face an awkward in-between stage when your baby is too big for a travel cot but not quite ready for an adult bed. Do you opt for a squeaky airbed; a bulky set of pillows they roll off of; or do you let them hop in with you and risk a midnight elbow to the chin?
The Tot-2-Ten Bundle Bed solves this dilemma and helps you all sleep soundly wherever you decide to go. It has everything you need for the kids to have a great night’s sleep.

Simply unclip, unroll, unzip and their bed is ready for them to sleep well.

<p>When designing this hoodie, we skipped the frivolous pockets, gimmicks and multiple zippers that you find on most “travel” hoodies. Instead,  we opted for a sleek, timeless, and minimalist design. This makes for a hoodie that has all the features you need and looks great in any situation. Less really is better.</p>

<p>Unbound Merino makes clothing that helps you see more of the world, without the burden of hauling around bulky luggage. Stylish, simple apparel that can be worn for weeks or even months - without ever needing to be washed.  Which means you can ditch the big suitcase, because all you'll need is your backpack.</p>
<p>The latest addition to our selective line is a must have for all trips, an ultralight hoodie made from nature's most high performance technical fabric – Merino wool. Here's why The Compact Travel Hoodie will be the best hoodie you've ever traveled with:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>It’s mind-blowingly thin and light, yet super warm:</strong> Don’t let it’s lightweight fool you. Merino wool is a high performance insulator and body temperature regulator. Although this is one of the lightest hoodies you’ll ever put on - it stood up to our extreme tests, standing strong in the frigid cold Canadian winter.</li>
<li>
<strong>It compresses to a small roll:</strong> Saving you tons of bag space compared to a traditional bulkier sweater.</li>
<li>
<strong>It’s wrinkle resistant: </strong>That means it's great for packing. When you pull it out of your bag, it'll be good to go.</li>
<li>
<strong>It’s antibacterial and odor-resistant:</strong> It stays clean and fresh without needing to be washed, even after months of wearing. </li>
<li>
<strong>It’s fast drying &amp; moisture wicking:</strong> That means you’ll always stay dry and comfortable.</li>
<li>
<strong>It’s warm, yet breathable:</strong> Merino wool is a great insulator, but it’s also naturally breathable. That means your extra body heat will escape and you’ll never overheat.</li>
<li><strong>Includes a carrying pouch for easy transport.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Not to mention, it’s sleek, minimal and versatile design will have you looking great no matter where your travels take you.</p>

<p>Lose your shirt while camping?  Don’t sweat it, Merino Wool garments will biodegrade back into soil within a few years.</p>
<p>Between Australia and New Zealand there are about 70 million Merino sheep producing this miraculous fiber year round, raised on a simple diet of grass pasture. Each year, the Merino produce a brand-new fleece making this natural harvest of wool completely renewable and sustainable. All while creating a thriving, multi-generational and ethical industry in both nations.</p>

<p>The benefits of Unbound go beyond travel. Having less (but better) stuff will not only simplify your life abroad, it will also add simplicity to your life at home.</p>

<p>In a perfect world, you would be wearing your favourite clothing every day. Unbound lets you live in that world. Clothing that doesn’t go through the wash cycle with every wear keeps it’s form and fit. It’s like the first time you put it on, every time.</p>

<p>A lot of clothing purchased today is more or less disposable. It’s designed to deteriorate after a few wears. While it may seem to be a cheaper option with the initial purchase - it ends up costing more over time. Not to mention the human and environmental cost. Having a few items that last long create more value in the long run and is a better way to live.</p>

<p>Some people would say that wearing the same thing every day is weird and unfashionable. We say Steve Jobs was onto something. His clothing became his uniform, and his uniform asserted his status as a true icon.</p>
<p>Alice Gregory, a writer living in New York, had this to say about what happens when you wear the same thing every day:</p>

<p>Unbound Merino was founded by three lifelong best friends. In high school we got our first real taste of travel when we made art prints depicting our favorite bands and sold them on the road to make enough money to get from one concert to another.</p>
<p>Following a rock band around America was an adventure that paved the way for an addiction to experiencing the world. While traveling abroad, we discovered better and more effective ways to live simply and get the most out of each trip. </p>
<p>Unbound Merino was created with that same spirit in mind – to solve a problem we've had in our own travels. Turns out, hauling around luggage was just no way to see the world. Our vision was dreamed up and tested while on the road. The more we traveled luggage free, the more we realized that this was the only way to travel.</p>
<p>Since launching, our mission has been to bring that discovery – that sense of freedom, spontaneity and adventure – to people all over the world.</p>
<p>Our purpose is to help make your travel that much more rewarding.</p>

<p><strong>1.  Why doesn’t Unbound Merino clothing smell bad, even if worn for days or months at a time? </strong></p>
<p>To understand why Unbound Merino doesn’t retain odor, it’s first important to understand why most clothing ends up smelling after a wear or two. The sweat from your body doesn’t actually have any odor. But when it absorbs into materials like cotton, it becomes a breeding ground for bacteria - which is where those bad smells come from. Merino wool doesn’t give sweat the opportunity to develop bacteria because of how effectively it wicks the moisture away from your body. Merino constantly pulls sweat away from the body allowing it to evaporate. This keeps you dry and keeps your shirt from smelling bad.</p>
<p>We have put our product to the test like you wouldn’t believe. We have tried to find the limits of how many wears our clothing could handle before absolutely needing a wash and we haven’t found that limit yet.</p>
<p>Here is an example of what one of our the shirts from our first campaign (also available in this campaign) has gone through without a single wash:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worn 46 days in a row without exception</li>
<li>In that 46 days worn in the gym around 6 or 7 times through heavy cardio (testing the product was the motivation for the gym more so than sheer discipline)</li>
<li>Worn twice in the sauna (we meant it when we said we took this to the limits)</li>
<li>Worn to bed some nights and stayed on the body right through the day</li>
<li>Taken to Shanghai, Bangkok and Koh Tao, Thailand and worn daily in sweltering 40 degree weather.  (see our Indiegogo video from our previous campaign)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above was done without a wash. It never smelled. Not even slightly.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that whenever it was worn and heavily perspired into, it was hung up to air out and dry off before being put back on. Nobody wants to wear a wet shirt, and it does need to air out so that the moisture wicks away and bacteria isn’t formed. When alternating between 2 or 3 shirts over a trip, you can go months without a wash with ease. Our various hoodie prototypes we have been wearing almost every single day for over a year. One prototype has not been washed the entire year and has been worn frequently throughout the year. </p>
<p><strong>2.  Can I wear Unbound underwear everyday without a wash?</strong></p>
<p>This is one of the more awkward questions to answer... The short answer is yes. Absolutely. But that’s assuming you keep yourself clean. Catch our drift? Unlike cotton underwear, these will wick away moisture and prevent any odour causing bacteria so they can be worn for many days without a wash. That said, life happens so use your judgement and refresh these with a quick hand wash and air dry as  frequently as you require.</p>
<p><strong>3.  Where is your clothing made?</strong></p>
<p>Our hoodie, shirts and underwear are made in facilities in Wuxi and Jiaxing, China and our socks are made in our hometown of Toronto, Canada. </p>
<p><strong>4.  When I do wash my Unbound Merino clothing, what are the care instructions?</strong></p>
<p>Your hoodie, shirts, socks and underwear can be washed in a regular washing machine at a normal or cool temperature setting. Use regular detergent and avoid fabric softener. We prefer to hand wash because it’s easier and quicker (when traveling) but the choice is yours.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: DO NOT TUMBLE DRY. After a wash, ring out the water and lay your clothing flat on a towel to air dry, flipping periodically. Don’t leave directly in the sun to dry.</p>
<p><strong>5.  Where will your clothing ship from?</strong></p>
<p>All orders will ship from Toronto, Canada.</p>
<p><strong>6.  When can I expect my order to arrive?</strong></p>
<p>All orders will begin to ship in September, 2018. Shipping within Canada should take 3-5 days from the date of shipment, In the US should take 5-7 days and international orders should take around 4-6 weeks.  </p>
<p><strong>7. What if my order just doesn’t fit right?</strong></p>
<p>We are happy to offer exchanges if your Unbound Merino hoodie or shirts don't fit right. Just send your order back to us within 15 days and we’ll send the right size. However, we are unable to exchange underwear and socks for sanitary reasons. So please refer to our sizing chart as carefully as possible!</p>
<p><strong>8.  Wool sounds itchy, is Merino wool itchy?</strong></p>
<p>Not at all. It feels completely different to the touch than the traditional wool you’re thinking of. It’s light and soft on the skin and with it’s moisture wicking properties it maintains that smooth feel all day, even when you perspire while wearing it.</p>

</div></div>","When designing this hoodie, we skipped the frivolous pockets, gimmicks and multiple zippers that you find on most “travel” hoodies. Instead,  we opted for a sleek, timeless, and minimalist design. This makes for a hoodie that has all the features you need and looks great in any situation. Less really is better.
 



Unbound Merino makes clothing that helps you see more of the world, without the burden of hauling around bulky luggage. Stylish, simple apparel that can be worn for weeks or even months - without ever needing to be washed.  Which means you can ditch the big suitcase, because all you'll need is your backpack.
The latest addition to our selective line is a must have for all trips, an ultralight hoodie made from nature's most high performance technical fabric – Merino wool. Here's why The Compact Travel Hoodie will be the best hoodie you've ever traveled with:
 


It’s mind-blowingly thin and light, yet super warm: Don’t let it’s lightweight fool you. Merino wool is a high performance insulator and body temperature regulator. Although this is one of the lightest hoodies you’ll ever put on - it stood up to our extreme tests, standing strong in the frigid cold Canadian winter.

It compresses to a small roll: Saving you tons of bag space compared to a traditional bulkier sweater.

It’s wrinkle resistant: That means it's great for packing. When you pull it out of your bag, it'll be good to go.

It’s antibacterial and odor-resistant: It stays clean and fresh without needing to be washed, even after months of wearing. 

It’s fast drying & moisture wicking: That means you’ll always stay dry and comfortable.

It’s warm, yet breathable: Merino wool is a great insulator, but it’s also naturally breathable. That means your extra body heat will escape and you’ll never overheat.
Includes a carrying pouch for easy transport.

 
Not to mention, it’s sleek, minimal and versatile design will have you looking great no matter where your travels take you.
 

 
Over the past  year, travelers in over 90 countries have come to wear and love Unbound Merino T-Shirts, socks and underwear - Now, the Unbound Merino Compact Hoodie is here to help you travel lighter and smarter.
 




 
When you pack light, you travel more freely. Packing light helps you helps you disconnect from the often cluttered and material world you left behind. Not to mention...

 


 


 
That’s right! Because the Compact Travel Hoodie is antibacterial, moisture wicking and odor-resistant, our hoodie will stay clean and fresh month after month without needing a wash. That means you can drastically reduce how many warm threads you need to pack. This hoodie covers all your bases, and feels new and fresh every time you put it on. Plus, you won't have to visit the laundromat while trying to enjoy your vacation.
 

 
Merino wool is nature's ultimate performance fabric. Typically used for high-performance active-wear, we took all the benefits of this incredible fiber and used it to create a sleek and stylish hoodie you can wear just about anywhere and look great.  Here's why our Merino wool will change the way you pack:



 

 



 

Lose your shirt while camping?  Don’t sweat it, Merino Wool garments will biodegrade back into soil within a few years.
Between Australia and New Zealand there are about 70 million Merino sheep producing this miraculous fiber year round, raised on a simple diet of grass pasture. Each year, the Merino produce a brand-new fleece making this natural harvest of wool completely renewable and sustainable. All while creating a thriving, multi-generational and ethical industry in both nations.
 

The benefits of Unbound go beyond travel. Having less (but better) stuff will not only simplify your life abroad, it will also add simplicity to your life at home.
Here are just some of the things that will happen when you Live Unbound:

Your laundry machine will be lonelier than ever. With a wardrobe full of clothing that rarely needs to be washed, you’ll save time, money and energy.

There’s an endless amount of decisions to be made from the second you wake up.  Spend less time deciding what to wear in the morning, so you can keep focused on the things that really matter.

In a perfect world, you would be wearing your favourite clothing every day. Unbound lets you live in that world. Clothing that doesn’t go through the wash cycle with every wear keeps it’s form and fit. It’s like the first time you put it on, every time.

A lot of clothing purchased today is more or less disposable. It’s designed to deteriorate after a few wears. While it may seem to be a cheaper option with the initial purchase - it ends up costing more over time. Not to mention the human and environmental cost. Having a few items that last long create more value in the long run and is a better way to live.

Some people would say that wearing the same thing every day is weird and unfashionable. We say Steve Jobs was onto something. His clothing became his uniform, and his uniform asserted his status as a true icon.
Alice Gregory, a writer living in New York, had this to say about what happens when you wear the same thing every day:
“This is the reason why characters in picture books never change their outfit: Children—like adults, if they’d only admit it—crave continuity. Adopting the habit of wearing a uniform is not unstylish—this is a classification that no longer applies.”
 


 


 
Unbound Merino was founded by three lifelong best friends. In high school we got our first real taste of travel when we made art prints depicting our favorite bands and sold them on the road to make enough money to get from one concert to another.
Following a rock band around America was an adventure that paved the way for an addiction to experiencing the world. While traveling abroad, we discovered better and more effective ways to live simply and get the most out of each trip. 
Unbound Merino was created with that same spirit in mind – to solve a problem we've had in our own travels. Turns out, hauling around luggage was just no way to see the world. Our vision was dreamed up and tested while on the road. The more we traveled luggage free, the more we realized that this was the only way to travel.
Since launching, our mission has been to bring that discovery – that sense of freedom, spontaneity and adventure – to people all over the world.
Our purpose is to help make your travel that much more rewarding.
 

MINIMALISM.
In a world dominated by fast-fashion, we want to slow things down. We produce timeless, versatile pieces that are designed to last. You’ll quickly find that the benefits of Unbound extend far beyond travel and into your everyday life. Helping you declutter your daily routine, save money and time, and focus on the things that actually matter.

<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>We launched this campaign to share a special place - The Yurt at Mt Snow - with you! We funded and built the yurt but we need two things before we can ""open"" - an incinerator toilet and a pellet stove (for heat).  Help us get <strong>The Yurt at Mt Snow</strong> over the finish line and access this exclusive opportunity!</p>
<p><strong>Why It's Awesome:</strong> 1. The yurt is a cool dwelling to stay in! (And there are very few in this area open to the public for stays). 2. The view is tremendous!  3. The location is private without being remote. 4. There will be only a limited number of days open to the public each year, so this is a great a chance to get in!</p>
<p><strong>Perks: </strong>High quality magnets, Bella &amp; Canvas T-shirts and best of all...STAYS at the yurt!</p>

<h3>Our Story </h3>
<p>Last year, our family bought a unique 20-acre property in Southern Vermont, about 10 minute from the ski mountain, Mount Snow. Thus began a year-long endeavor to build a special getaway there.</p>
<p>Our vision was to create a true escape: a place to relax, adventure, immerse yourself in nature, wake up with the sun, and disconnect from the day-to-day. As for where to sleep….well, we imagined something one-of-a-kind, private, cozy and comfortable, something that would be just as cool as Vermont is! Long story short, we built a yurt!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1614049236/gzcl3btsdnbl4lzbdylm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About the Yurt</strong></h3>
<p>Yurts (or gers) are traditional Mongolian nomadic structures.  They are circular, with a transparent dome at the top of the ceiling that lets in natural light and offers a special view of our forest canopy!  Our Pacific Yurt is 24’ in diameter and outfitted with a “snow load package” to handle a typical VT winter.  </p>
<p>Inside, there is a comfortable queen-sized bed, a futon and an armchair for gathering and a kitchen area where you can prepare simple meals.  This is a getaway in nature - the yurt is surrounded by maple and birch trees, and boasts a stellar mountain view.  We have electricity!  We do *not* have running water so there is no shower but there will be an incinerator toilet! There is a large bowl inside the yurt for rinsing small plates and washing hands.  Although it's rustic, it's comfortable and we have found that the running water trade-off is worth it for this setting!</p>

<h3>The Surrounding Area: Dover, Wilmington, and Mount Snow</h3>
<p>If you’re dreaming of your next unique getaway, an amazing experience awaits you here! </p>
<p><strong>If relaxation is your thing: </strong>You can spend time in the yurt just quietly relaxing on the couch enjoying a good book or watching the sky change over the mountain view. The yurt's simple kitchen (with a small fridge, toaster oven and hot plate) will enable you to cook simple meals together. The deck has a grill and chairs where you can sit under the shade of maple trees and relax the day away.</p>
<p><strong>If getting your heart-rate up is your speed: </strong>You can hike (or snowshoe!) about 800 feet to the top of the property and peer through the trees at views of Mt. Snow and Haystack Mountains. Keep an eye out for the peekaboo views we’ve cleared in the forest along the way. And, about 1 mile up the road there's a public trail through the forest for walking, snowshoeing or cross-country skiing. The yurt is located 5 miles (10 minutes) from Mount Snow (now part of Vail). In the summer, we’ve enjoyed swimming at the local reservoirs where crystal clear waters and mountain backdrops paint the scene.</p>
<p><strong>If you're like to walk through town: </strong> The town of Dover, VT is 5 minutes away the yurt is  15 minutes from downtown Wilmington, VT - a charming town home to delicious eateries and unique shops.  In 30 minutes you can be in Brattleboro, VT.</p>

</div></div>","NAUCRATES is the smart luggage that makes traveling easy - with features like self-following, obstacle avoidance, smart unlocking, a built-in battery, GPS tracking, and the ability to ride-on for up to 4.3 miles.   
  
   Naucrates it's an idea that spans from all the struggles of walking through crowded airports and busy train stations. It comes to solve the hurdles we all associate with travel. No matter how much we all love visiting new places, the hard truth we can't deny is - traveling it's tiring.
This new luggage concept has all the bells and whistles: it follows you on its own, avoids obstacles, is strong enough to let you ride it, and has a secure fingerprint sensor with a TSA approved lock.
 
   


With a range of 4.3 miles (7 km), intuitive joystick control and comfortable foot support that can sustain up to 120 kg, NAUCRATES radically transforms the convenience with which we travel in a multitude of ways.
         
  

The longest walking distance from gate to gate at any airport around the world is at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), measuring just over 1.8 miles (3km). NAUCRATES can easily traverse the distance twice on one single charge and still have power left in its battery.
 
  


Precise controls with an ergonomic and lightweight remote control
         
 

 

 
 
With advanced AI algorithms and industry-leading sensors, NAUCRATES can move with autonomy, avoid obstacles, follow you and never leave your sight.
NAUCRATES follows you for up to 6.2 miles ( 10km), with exceptional maneuverability inside airports or out on the street.
 

 
 
Thanks to ultrasonic induction, NAUCRATES can detect its environment and adjusts its own movement accordingly. Successfully sensing its surrounding objects’ movement and location, NAUCRATES keeps on a safe path without disturbing anyone or anything around it.

 
Made with high-quality German materials, NAUCRATES strikes the perfect balance between weight and sturdiness. Built with a flexible yet strong PC material, NAUCRATES is lightweight, but capable of withstanding heavy pressure and mishandling.
  

With great reinforcement engineering in its internal structure and strong outer casing, NAUCRATES is able to support a rider weighing up to 264.5 lbs (120kg).
 

 
 
Thoroughly tested in different environments, the wheels are built with great emphasis on durability and shock absorption, ensuring a smooth ride.
 
 
 
Secure your valuables with a fast, built-in fingerprint scanner. NAUCRATES offers an enhanced smart security, while still keeping a TSA-approved lock for custom controls.

 
 
Open your luggage in less than a second, with exclusive access. Calibrate to only your fingerprint or share access with loved ones.
 

 

With the TSA approved lock, the airport custom personnel can access your luggage without breaking in and damaging your smart lock.
 

 

Thanks to an intelligent alert system, NAUCRATES will set an alarm on your remote, letting you know if you’re more than 10 meters away from it. By pressing the “Return to Owner” button, the luggage will find its way back to you automatically while avoiding any obstacles in its path.

I am a seasoned marketing professional with a strong passion for film, history, geography, genetics, anthropology, human heritage, languages, world cuisine, and more. Unfortunately, there is tremendous underrepresentation and ignorance when it comes to Central Asia both in the United States, and internationally. When most people think of Central Asia, their understanding is linked to an inaccurate portrayal depicted in the widely popular Borat franchise. It is important to me that I, as a person with a Central Asian background, crush those stereotypes and show the gorgeous, bountiful reality and culture of my people to the rest of the world. The overall vision is to take audiences on a fun, colorful, and delicious journey throughout the Central Asian region, where we can educate and experience the history, culture, and local cuisine together. That, I hope, will open up the area to international business, tourism and mainstream media. The plan is to visit every country in the region and create 4-5 episodes per country. Each episode will serve as a “show and tell” about prominent, culturally significant sites and the cuisine specific to that area.  I have started this campaign in order to build funds for the project, and hope there are people out there that would be interested in helping me provide knowledge to the public about the region. Central Asia has long been under-appreciated and undiscovered, despite the fact that it’s an incredible destination with a rich history. Did you know that the first horse was domesticated here? Many of the world’s most useful inventions came from Central Asia, like sewing, leather, cart wheels, spinning wheels, and burning coal. There are multiple UNESCO World Heritage sites in the region that are unknown to the mainstream public. These are little but monumental facts that I think deserve to be known. I am hoping to raise some funding to purchase the necessary filming equipment and start my project.

However, I am not relying on their support/sponsorship, as this is a passion project that will come to fruition regardless. Please help make this project a reality.

We can excitingly say we are looking forward to another summer of local adventure, getting more Atlantic Canadian's exploring their backyards and supporting our local tourism industry!Other Ways You Can HelpPlease share our campaign through the Indiegogo Share Tools!

The outer layer keeps wind and moisture from passing through the jacket. The inner membrane has small holes that prevent any liquid water from passing through while still allowing water vapor to escape, keeping your body dry and at a consistent temperature in any weather condition. The Pilloon Jacket Ultralight is perfect for even the most active uses, ensuring extreme comfort even after prolonged use. Plus, the Ultra-AirTex fabric is micro-elastic, letting you move with effortless flexibility and comfort during sports or other physical activities.The exceptional breathable capability of 20,000g/m²/24h. The Pilloon Ultralight is low-temperature resistant and offers 0 CFM wind protection capability to guarantee a comfortable and consistent body temperature during use. The hem of the jacket even features a retractable adjustment cord to prevent cold air from entering. The Pilloon Ultralight has been treated with active ingredients to prevent the growth of bacteria and fungi on the fabric and ensure safety and sanitization every time you enjoy the outdoors.At AirOgo, we have made our jackets UV-resistant with UPF50+ protection to offer a 99% UV shielding rate and safeguard your skin's health. With six pockets strategically located, the Pilloon Ultralight always has the perfect spot for whatever you want to carry.*Pocket 1 & 2: Anti-theft interior chest pockets for your cell phone, passport, wallet, and other important items.*Pocket 3 & 6: A subway or credit card can fit perfectly in the pockets on your arm, keeping them always right at hand. There is even a cleaning wipe for your convenience on the go.*Pocket 4 & 5: Large exterior pockets with built-in key fobs; each pocket has a zipper to seal your belongings safely and securely while climbing, jogging, or biking. The double-slider zipper allows you to free up your waist and hips while wearing the jacket in an air-conditioned room, which will keep you warm without compromising the practicality of your movements. Or, on a bike, just pull up the bottom of the zipper to continue riding comfortably without having your jacket bunched up at your hips. The Pilloon Ultralight is built to last. We use a seamless technique to reinforce the stress points of our jacket, which occur at the zipper and waist.At AirOgo, we pay the utmost attention to details because we care about providing you with a product that will be around for a lifetime of comfort and weather protection. Here is how to properly fold your Pilloon Ultralight in just eight seconds! AirOgo Pilloon Ultralight is the second generation of our Pilloon Jacket, which has raised over USD 300,000 on the Taiwanese platform Zeczec, resulting in one of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns for performance jackets ever.

<p>We have been providing our customers with various outdoor dog equipment since 2016. In addition, we have been hosting our annual ‘Yosemite Camp’ an event centered around enjoying nature with your dog. Our pride comes from creating a wonderful environment for our pets-from watching their joy as they run through nature, or go for a ride with their owners. Through these experiences, we have recognized a need for safer and more comfortable equipment geared for the outdoors. After nearly two and a half years of deliberation and research, we developed our ‘TAILHIGH’ brand. We now introduce our first product: the ‘Hybrid Harness’.

TAILHIGH's 2-in-1 harness & leash is lightweight and extremely strong. The 5-foot retractable leash is designed for convenience and safety, providing you just enough length to walk your dog without being tangled in the lead. Our award-winning, patented, two-way lock system provides a safety stop for when you need more control. We use premium non-toxic materials and a Y-shaped chest pad to ensure your dog's comfortability all day. With TAILHIGH, there's no more hassle leashing and unleashing. No More Leashing and UnleashingWith a 5-foot retractable leash, there's no more worrying about leashing and unleashing your dog. Simply, pick up or release the lead when you're ready to go.

 Comfort Design | Y-Shaped Chest PadWe use an advanced sewing method and premium materials to ensure your dog is comfortable. The chest pad and backplate smoothly fit to the body, protecting dogs from irritation.Water-Resistant LeashTAILHIGH uses water-and-erosion-resistant materials because we know some dogs like to swim in the water and roll in the mud. Water will be drained and won't damage the system. Tested and approved by adventurous dogs, TAILHIGH can be worn in any environment.Premium Non-Toxic MaterialsWe use elastomer, a type of rubber that is flexible and robust. Elastomer is a non-toxic material that is used in baby toys and bottles. TAILHIGH's non-erosion materials are water resistant.​Premium HandleWalking your dog can put a strain on your hand, which is why we've upgraded our handles with a neoprene inner cushion for sizes M - XL. Each handle is big enough to wrap around your wrist.Momentary Safety Stop FunctionAfter seven rounds of design changes, we've created a patented two-way auto-lock system that can be stopped with a slight pull. This safety feature is based on the seat-belt principle and has passed usability tests for various breeds to ensure your dog and those around them are safe.Lightweight and Extremely StrongTAILHIGH weighs about 4.6 ounces (the weight of two eggs) and is strong enough to pull a 1-Ton truck. A test from a certified lab came out 888 N (90 Kgf) for a size Large leash. The lead is 5-ft long. TAILHIGH Unboxing

<h2>About the creators and Mapo Tapo</h2>
<p>Hi! I am Daniele Calvo Pollino, Co-creator of the climbing travel guide and co-founder at Mapo Tapo, nice to meet you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1606394766/vwflukr2amte2uf4zbdh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This pic was taken in early 2020 in Fontainebleau, right at before the beginning of COVID19 pandemic. Me and <strong>Alessia Fontanari (the other co-founder)</strong> were working days and nights in our living room to try to build an outdoor sport travel company in the middle of the pandemic. </p>
<p>At that time, I had recently quit my job in a multinational company as product manager, while Alessia was a consultant. </p>
<p>Most importantly, <strong>me and Ale have been rock climbing around the world for the past 10 years</strong> and we had this big dream of creating a company to develop a new way of traveling: away from crowds, immersed in nature, and doing our favorite sport.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>While we were in lockdown, we met <strong>other 2 fantastic members of the team (Andrea Palazzi and Andrea Guffanti</strong>), and together, we managed to create a passionate community around our mission. Also, we put in place a strong partner network to work with and all the tech infrastructure. </p>
<p>As soon as the pandemic gave us a break, we managed to make <strong>a lot of climbers traveling</strong>, bringing them to local climbing communities around the world, <strong>financing several new routes where we travelled.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now </strong>we are <strong>temporarily stuck in lockdown</strong> again <strong>but our passion and mission is stronger than ever</strong>.</p>
<p>No matter if we cannot bring climbers and outdoor lovers around the world to awesome climbing destinations and communities… <strong>with this book we will bring local climbing communities around the world to you.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why do we need 10K euro? </h2>
<p>The Climbing Travel Guide is indeed a<strong> collaborative effort</strong>. Pictures and stories will be sourced from 50 different photographers all around the globe. Also, the design of the guidebook and all the illustrations will be managed by some of the most prominent business professionals within the outdoor world.</p>
<p>We want to make sure that all the <strong>people involved in the project will be paid fairly</strong>.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p><strong>Creating a</strong> top-notch and well-designed <strong>storybook in a historical period </strong>where businesses are still dealing with the consequences of the pandemic <strong>has certain associated risks</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>To minimize the risks</strong>, we <strong>already </strong>connected and <strong>closed contracts</strong> <strong>with </strong>a great number of <strong>professionals </strong>that will be involved in the book production (among which the main designer and the main illustrator of the book and numerous photographers and copy editors of the different locations). </p>
<p><strong>As a team, we internally own all the skills and knowledge to make this project happen</strong> and <strong>we partner with an important logistics provider</strong> in Italy to manage all the distribution processes worldwide. </p>
<p>There might be some delay in shipping given the current pandemic, but <strong>we will do everything possible in our hands to limit and mitigate all the problems that may occur</strong>.</p>

About the creators and Mapo Tapo
Hi! I am Daniele Calvo Pollino, Co-creator of the climbing travel guide and co-founder at Mapo Tapo, nice to meet you!
 

 
This pic was taken in early 2020 in Fontainebleau, right at before the beginning of COVID19 pandemic. Me and Alessia Fontanari (the other co-founder) were working days and nights in our living room to try to build an outdoor sport travel company in the middle of the pandemic. 
At that time, I had recently quit my job in a multinational company as product manager, while Alessia was a consultant. 
Most importantly, me and Ale have been rock climbing around the world for the past 10 years and we had this big dream of creating a company to develop a new way of traveling: away from crowds, immersed in nature, and doing our favorite sport.
 

 
While we were in lockdown, we met other 2 fantastic members of the team (Andrea Palazzi and Andrea Guffanti), and together, we managed to create a passionate community around our mission. Also, we put in place a strong partner network to work with and all the tech infrastructure. 
As soon as the pandemic gave us a break, we managed to make a lot of climbers traveling, bringing them to local climbing communities around the world, financing several new routes where we travelled.
Now we are temporarily stuck in lockdown again but our passion and mission is stronger than ever.
No matter if we cannot bring climbers and outdoor lovers around the world to awesome climbing destinations and communities… with this book we will bring local climbing communities around the world to you.
 
Why do we need 10K euro? 
The Climbing Travel Guide is indeed a collaborative effort. Pictures and stories will be sourced from 50 different photographers all around the globe. Also, the design of the guidebook and all the illustrations will be managed by some of the most prominent business professionals within the outdoor world.
We want to make sure that all the people involved in the project will be paid fairly.
 

Budget split 
 
Are you an outdoor sports photographer? 
If you are an outdoor photographer who lived in a climbing destination that took your breath away and where the development of climbing could make a difference for local communities, do reach out at hello@mapotapo.com! We would be very happy to talk!
 
The guidebook timeline

 
Risks and challenges
Creating a top-notch and well-designed storybook in a historical period where businesses are still dealing with the consequences of the pandemic has certain associated risks. 
To minimize the risks, we already connected and closed contracts with a great number of professionals that will be involved in the book production (among which the main designer and the main illustrator of the book and numerous photographers and copy editors of the different locations). 
As a team, we internally own all the skills and knowledge to make this project happen and we partner with an important logistics provider in Italy to manage all the distribution processes worldwide. 
There might be some delay in shipping given the current pandemic, but we will do everything possible in our hands to limit and mitigate all the problems that may occur.",19.0,1,"1 Campaign

If using a power bank, running time is shown in the table below. We're always happy provide personalized advice on the most suitable power supply for your individual requirements so feel free to contact us if you have any questions: team@outbacklogic.com From 20D nylon ripstop to YKK zippers and 7000 series aluminum poles, every part of the Siesta2 is premium quality and engineered to last.Our top of the line materials and workmanship put the Siesta2 on a par with other premier camping brand names for build quality and durability - and at a lower price than most! Combined with the game-changing improvement in temperature regulation, we think you’ll agree, it’s one hell of a tent and great value for money! Yep, the Siesta2 really does have six legs! Unlike many tents in its class, it has a centre truss (cross) pole that extends right to the ground. This has several advantages:
100% freestanding so you don’t need to stake out the vestibules separately.  
The tent holds its complete shape without any stakes, making it super quick and easy to setup and re-position. Especially handy if the ground is rocky and you need to find the sweet spots for stakes or other anchor points such as rocks or trees.  
Greater wind resistance
Superior compression strength  
 
  Don’t be fooled by the clean, understated looks of the Siesta2. There’s a lot going on under the hood!  Key to creating a compact, lightweight tent was the development of our new heat & light blocking fly fabric. We took all the knowledge and experience we gained creating the Siesta4 and set out to develop our lightest, most durable fly fabric yet, whilst increasing the efficiency with which it blocks solar radiation.  We started with the highest quality 20D nylon ripstop and added a new structure of high performance coatings.This took many iterations of design, sampling and testing to reach the optimal balance of weight, durability and performance.The reason our fabric is so effective is that it reflects and blocks ultraviolet, visible and infrared light.Distribution of Solar Energy Hitting Your TentTypical lightweight tent fabrics are virtually transparent to solar radiation, which is why they become a greenhouse.Some companies offer 'darkroom' and 'blackout' tents or canopies that provide a dark interior, but the heat reduction is minimal because their fabric only blocks visible light. Our fabric reflects the sun's energy and has a unique low-emissivity coating that also blocks infrared heat. This transforms the performance of the fabric.Fabric Samples Placed on a Hotplate    We're happy to ship anywhere, but for all destinations outside of the lower 48 US states please contact us for a quote and we'll send you a custom purchase link that includes the correct rate: team@outbacklogic.com",30.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>A really big bonus with the design is the heat that is generated from it –as well as making a great focal point for any event, it creates a cosy atmosphere and provides real comfort and warmth, truly bringing people together outdoors. And so it can be used all year round.</p>
<p><strong>Aquaforno becomes the heart of the moment – literally and metaphorically</strong></p>
</div><hr/><h2>What's included?</h2><p>The key to all Aquafornos has always been the telescopic three tier chassis, it ensures you can always cook what you want to cook but you only ever have to carry the parts you need. The bayonet fittings on the upper sections allow them to separate in seconds and no tools are ever required in assembly.</p><hr/><h3>Tier 1: The Base</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520376555/kkwfgchpgmplt2olpj7m.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;width: 260px;""/>The base section sits on<strong> sturdy tripod legs, each with its own adjustment, </strong>allowing you to level the unit on variable terrain. The Aquaforno II comes with leg clips allowing you to place a plate of food underneath to keep warm or melt your favourite cheese on your burgers.</p><p>The <strong>removable grill</strong> allows you to utilise it as a simple light weight cooking grill or a fire pit and the new larger door vent allows greater airflow adjustability.</p><p><strong>The boiler- a removable food grade stainless steel water jacket sits here.</strong> Its crescent shape helps it surround the fire for reliable fast boiling. It is <strong>easy to clean and dishwasher friendly</strong> allowing you to mull wine or cider instead of just boiling water for hot drinks.</p><hr/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520443216/zbkhks7jxqggi1koqz0i.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;width: 260px;""/></p><h3>Tier 2: The Brazier</h3><p>The second section allows you to raise the grill if cooking over wood, this is also where you will do <strong>most of your frying as a pan or wok can sit easily on the adjustable tabs</strong>. The stone can also sit on the tabs and becomes a very handy dry hot plate for toasting. It’s  also a great place to keep tapas foods hot, or warm cheeses, if you are snacking with a glass of wine.</p><hr/><h3> </h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520443504/y06lyulsf1voh1z6qc9o.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;width: 260px;""/></p><h3>Tier 3: The Oven Top</h3><p>The top section encloses the oven. The stone placed on the adjustable tabs below can be lowered to ensure there is <strong>space for large cuts of meat, a casserole, Dutch Oven or a Beer Can Chicken</strong>. Raised a couple of notches for your favourite deep pan pizza or pastries or up all four for a thin and crispy Neapolitan style Pizza. This adjustability combined with the newly insulated lid, with its <strong>thermometer</strong> ensures you can always get the right setting for your food.</p><p>The hangers or side arms are located at the top of the oven section and will allow clothes or towels to be dried outside the unit. The arms are notched to enable you to always have a handy place for your utensils. The arms can be hung inside, so if you seal up the stove, these also make it easier to hang fish for smoking. <strong>When smoking meats</strong> the grill can be mounted at the top away from the coals in the base.</p><p><strong>The oven wall is also designed  with the new key- way covers and the removable bracket, to hold a rotisserie  (optional perk), for anything from Duck to kebabs</strong>.</p><hr/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520376934/isvuzim7lvrq9rnpsts1.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 260px;float: left;""/></p><h3>The Carry  Case</h3><p>The Aquaforno II comes with a double bag system one within the other. The padded outer bag still retains the adjustable backpack straps and twin carry handles. The inner bag is designed to carry parts such as the stone, tabs, grills and tap and allows you to share the weight with a friend, or  carry two-thirds back pack style and a third in your hand. This ensures you never have to carry more than 15 kg in one item if necessary.</p><p>It is also fire retarded and can be placed under an Aquaforno II to protect grass or on a table when you are using it as an eye level oven.</p><hr/><h2>What fuel does it use?</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520450522/tmp6ecjhp40a2uw0tc6f.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Wood, peat, charcoal or gas</strong>. We would always recommend either kiln dried or well air dried logs.  You can also kiln dry the wood on the pizza stone when not cooking -and added bonus for those who love foraging for food and generally unheard of on other portable BBQs and pizza ovens. <strong>All lump wood or briquette charcoals can be used </strong>but we would generally recommend trying to avoid manufactured briquettes with additives due to their unpleasant odor.</p><hr/><h2>Safety</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520451113/gqhmfcbae1gem9pzdkah.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 260px;float: right;""/></p><p>The Aquaforno II builds on our history of safe design. Our earliest units evolved after accessing A&amp;E / ER data from NHS hospitals.

Our side arms are designed to bend before causing injury.</p><p>Forest fire. The Aquaforno II has been designed to switch from wood to gas in areas of high fire risk. The walls of the unit will absorb heat from the burner and will still allow you to stay warm in high winds or if in an environment where open fires or fire pits are prohibited.</p><p>The internal boiler is not a pressure vessel and vents safely within the walls of the stove. The lid is also removable making it easy to clean. <strong>The Aquaforno II comes with a spark arrestor, gloves and a fire proof inner bag to prevent heat effecting surfaces below</strong>. Our Aquaforno II Black  has a specilaist paint coating as opposed to a porcelain enamel which could  shatter like glass if treated harshly</p><hr/><h3>All the extras included:</h3><ul>
<li>A high quality <strong>cordierite pizza stone</strong> –  this ensures a tasty pizza is cooked in minutes,</li>
<li>
<strong>Hangers</strong> - hang your utensils here conveniently and no more miserable moments, with the ability to dry your clothes, towels, socks shoes and children.</li>
<li>A <strong>double lined insulated lid </strong>In addition to the new outdoor gastronomical possibilities, the latest Aquaforno II design includes this  a for enhanced temperature stability.</li>
<li>The new <strong>thermometer </strong>and the adjustable  stone height and larger vent on the lower door allows for improved temperature control.</li>

Go outside.  Photo credit: Carl PendleEntertain, camp, glamp, adventure, party, eat well and keep warm; be inspired with the Aquaforno II.The Aquaforno is the world's most versatile outdoor cooking stove.  It’s a big claim to make, we know. But, have you ever come across a BBQ grill, pizza oven, rotisserie, smoker, water boiler, clothes dryer and outdoor heater all in one – AND one that is portable and multi-fueled too?We wanted to create a gastronomical phenomenon that ticks all the boxes to enhance the outdoor living experience.What makes it so versatile? And who is it for?Firstly it is portable and also space saving due to its unique telescopic design. Whether you’re at a camp site, on the beach, on a hunting expedition or in the backyard, the Aquaforno II can go where you go and cater for all your outdoor needs.We realized that enjoying outdoor life can be through a multitude of activities or quite simply with delicious food and warmth.  Aquaforno offers a bespoke experience for a range of different hobbyists:
Camping/Glamping
Tailgaters
Scouts & Guides
Hunting, Fishing, Prepping, Survivalists
Overland expeditions, RV  
Surfers
Foodies
Gadget Lovers
Feed the many or the few- it all works well
 Cooks an amazing variety of foodsYou can cook almost anything you desire with charcoal or with  wood for that great rustic tasting food - whether you’re a chef at heart or a ‘ready-made’ cook, you can choose what you want to eat. From restaurant quality pizzas to pies, classic grilled meat, tagines, roast dinners, baked potatoes, paella and desserts to die for.Render credit: Alexandar StoyanovPhoto credit: Chloe Billebault
Hot Water on Demand
And then there is the internal water boiler which no other stove contains.  Enjoy hot drinks or wash-up via the removable, dishwasher-friendly reservoir that provides a litre of boiling water every six to ten minutes.
The water is heated from the same fuel source as cooking so you can have that welcome cup of tea/coffee whilst cooking. Saving on appliances and fuel. 

Get that warm feeling
A really big bonus with the design is the heat that is generated from it –as well as making a great focal point for any event, it creates a cosy atmosphere and provides real comfort and warmth, truly bringing people together outdoors. And so it can be used all year round.
Aquaforno becomes the heart of the moment – literally and metaphorically
What's included?The key to all Aquafornos has always been the telescopic three tier chassis, it ensures you can always cook what you want to cook but you only ever have to carry the parts you need. The bayonet fittings on the upper sections allow them to separate in seconds and no tools are ever required in assembly.Tier 1: The BaseThe base section sits on sturdy tripod legs, each with its own adjustment, allowing you to level the unit on variable terrain. The Aquaforno II comes with leg clips allowing you to place a plate of food underneath to keep warm or melt your favourite cheese on your burgers.The removable grill allows you to utilise it as a simple light weight cooking grill or a fire pit and the new larger door vent allows greater airflow adjustability.The boiler- a removable food grade stainless steel water jacket sits here. Its crescent shape helps it surround the fire for reliable fast boiling. It is easy to clean and dishwasher friendly allowing you to mull wine or cider instead of just boiling water for hot drinks.Tier 2: The BrazierThe second section allows you to raise the grill if cooking over wood, this is also where you will do most of your frying as a pan or wok can sit easily on the adjustable tabs. The stone can also sit on the tabs and becomes a very handy dry hot plate for toasting. It’s  also a great place to keep tapas foods hot, or warm cheeses, if you are snacking with a glass of wine. Tier 3: The Oven TopThe top section encloses the oven. The stone placed on the adjustable tabs below can be lowered to ensure there is space for large cuts of meat, a casserole, Dutch Oven or a Beer Can Chicken. Raised a couple of notches for your favourite deep pan pizza or pastries or up all four for a thin and crispy Neapolitan style Pizza. This adjustability combined with the newly insulated lid, with its thermometer ensures you can always get the right setting for your food.The hangers or side arms are located at the top of the oven section and will allow clothes or towels to be dried outside the unit. The arms are notched to enable you to always have a handy place for your utensils. The arms can be hung inside, so if you seal up the stove, these also make it easier to hang fish for smoking. When smoking meats the grill can be mounted at the top away from the coals in the base.The oven wall is also designed  with the new key- way covers and the removable bracket, to hold a rotisserie  (optional perk), for anything from Duck to kebabs.The Carry  CaseThe Aquaforno II comes with a double bag system one within the other. The padded outer bag still retains the adjustable backpack straps and twin carry handles. The inner bag is designed to carry parts such as the stone, tabs, grills and tap and allows you to share the weight with a friend, or  carry two-thirds back pack style and a third in your hand. This ensures you never have to carry more than 15 kg in one item if necessary.It is also fire retarded and can be placed under an Aquaforno II to protect grass or on a table when you are using it as an eye level oven.What fuel does it use?Wood, peat, charcoal or gas. We would always recommend either kiln dried or well air dried logs.  You can also kiln dry the wood on the pizza stone when not cooking -and added bonus for those who love foraging for food and generally unheard of on other portable BBQs and pizza ovens. All lump wood or briquette charcoals can be used but we would generally recommend trying to avoid manufactured briquettes with additives due to their unpleasant odor.SafetyThe Aquaforno II builds on our history of safe design. Our earliest units evolved after accessing A&E / ER data from NHS hospitals. Even though they come with a stable low centre of gravity all units have feet that can be pegged or screwed in place to prevent hazards being caused by children or pets. Our side arms are designed to bend before causing injury.Forest fire. The Aquaforno II has been designed to switch from wood to gas in areas of high fire risk. The walls of the unit will absorb heat from the burner and will still allow you to stay warm in high winds or if in an environment where open fires or fire pits are prohibited.The internal boiler is not a pressure vessel and vents safely within the walls of the stove. The lid is also removable making it easy to clean. The Aquaforno II comes with a spark arrestor, gloves and a fire proof inner bag to prevent heat effecting surfaces below. Our Aquaforno II Black  has a specilaist paint coating as opposed to a porcelain enamel which could  shatter like glass if treated harshlyAll the extras included:
A high quality cordierite pizza stone –  this ensures a tasty pizza is cooked in minutes,

Hangers - hang your utensils here conveniently and no more miserable moments, with the ability to dry your clothes, towels, socks shoes and children.
A double lined insulated lid In addition to the new outdoor gastronomical possibilities, the latest Aquaforno II design includes this  a for enhanced temperature stability.
The new thermometer and the adjustable  stone height and larger vent on the lower door allows for improved temperature control.
A spark arrestor has been built in for extra safety.
The spring-loaded legs for easier assembly.

Door latches are a more user-friendly, sturdier, door mechanism.
Ground heat shield- this will protect the ground but also serve as a food warming tray that slots on to the new tabs on the legs.
Putting it up or packing it away - it's all easy Incredibly easy to assemble, with no tools in under 2 minutes it can go up and be hot enough to use in 20 minutes. Because  the heat is contained, you are no longer at the mercy of the elements and cooking can carry on even in the rain! Packing away is also easy in under 10 mins from hot if you have too!The complimentary carry case keeps everything in one place and easy to store either on a hook in your garage or in the back of your car.There has never been a stove design that can cater to so many people’s needs.AccessoriesThe Paella PanMore than just a pan, our paella pans are sized perfectly so when not being used to fry or sautee on the bottom two sections, they will fit neatly under the lid to allow food to be kept warm. They are a great utensil for mixing and needing your pizza dough and you can leave it in the pan to prove next to the base of your Aquaforno II.Pizza KitThe Pizza kit consists of our 12“ Mezzeluna, perfect for cutting your pizzas as well as our own pizza peel, designed to rest on the leg clips to keep your food warm when not making pizza.Rotisserie KitWe've kept it simple and reliable and ensured the bracket takes the weight of your food, so the skewer spins easily through the keyway. The 8mm skewer is among the most widely used sizes on the market.Gas BurnerThe gas burner (optional perk) is designed to fit into the base section and has 2 rings. The twin ring gas burner has one ring for general cooking, the other to heat the boiler or both for cooking pizza. (It can work off a standard millibar regulator for LPG common in many RV’s systems) Technical detailsWe are working to very high standards of engineering and manufacturing in order to produce a robust, precision engineered product which is tough and as durable as possible. The lid and all three drums of the Aquaforno II stainless are 430 stainless steel which is a common material for similar chassis in the grill sector. The Aquaforno II Black are carbon steel with a hot-dip rust inhibitor and high temperature paint outer coating. All legs, ancillaries and rivets for both models are stainless steel. The water boilers are food grade 316 stainless steel.  The cordierite pizza stone is Grade A quality and can sustain  direct flame indefinitely.   What we need and how you can helpOur campaign is all about making the Aquaforno II more affordable  with volume production and therefore more available for people who share our love of food and the outdoors.We love the support and enthusiasm our existing customers continually show us about their beloved Aquafornos and the many heart warming meals they have cooked on them. With their feedback and continous R & D we have enhanced  and improved the original Aquaforno in every way.Our last model achieved Camping product of the Year 2017 (OIA) and we’ve perfected it for even better results.With your help we can produce the Aquaforno II using bespoke tooling and reducing the cost of production, transforming low volume hand-made manufacture to high volume,high quality affordable products. We will be very grateful for your help in contributing to this campaign and enabling us to take Aquaforno to the next level.We need $25,000 to launch production. We are working with a specialist manufacturer who has supplied over 2.5m bbqs for well known global brands. With their expertise and high quality production and your help in contributing we are excited to be able to take Aquaforno to the next level.In a hectic world, cooking with fire for friends and family is a truly soulful experience. The Aquaforno II has evolved to bring you the joy of warmth, delicious food and the comfort of hot drinks, simultaneously.Our aspirationsOur first aim is to be able  to produce affordable  high quality product for as many people as possible around the world. We do have a secondary aim  of being able to supply Aquaforno products to Aid agencies in order to help people in dire need of hot water, food and warmth due to extreme weather events or other circumstances and believe the Aquaforno II fits in perfectly with this aim. This will only be possible if we can reach very high volume production which will keep the cost down and make it a viable solution for the agencies in these areas.Risks and ChallengesAquaforno has been committed to the telescopic three tier system since its inception in 2011. It has proved reliable, efficient and flexible and has cooked thousands of outdoor meals around the world. The Aquaforno II is the result of optimization not full-scale experimentation and although the sample in our video is of a prototype quality we have experience in managing the manufacture of our products.Our new gas burner is still at approval stage and although the concept has been approved by UK government it will still be at least six weeks before it can be signed off for full approval.We have been working with our new manufacturer for 6 months and they have proven themselves to be our most knowledgeable and efficient specialist partner yet.They have a successful working history with many of North Americas and Europe's largest, grill and garden brands and have produced over 2.5 million grills for one US household name alone.We have timed the campaign to allow us to order during the low season for the manufacturers and we expect this will allow us to turnaround relatively fast deliveries which we currently forecast to be in July.Other Ways You Can HelpSo even if you don't have a need for the world's most versatile outdoor cooking stove, maybe you know someone who does.

<p>The Settra Series is a functional product that has undertaken many different forms through two years of sampling to achieve the best results. All of the products shown in the images and videos are the final version of the product aesthetically, though some features are subject to change in production. We’ve learned a lot in the past two years and built a very strong relationship with our factory along with a solid production plan.</p>
<p>Due to the current global COVID-19 issue changing everyday, production and delivery dates could be subject to change though our factory has assured us that their production line and schedules have not been affected. We will make sure to keep everything transparent and ensure every backer is updated on a regular basis on the progress of production and shipping.</p>
<p>Environmental commitments</p>
<p>Long-lasting design</p>
<p>The Settra Series has been two years in the making. We have meticulously tested both form and function to make sure the materials we chose were durable, attractive, and built to last for any adventure. We have stress tested each bag to ensure quality and used them practically in our everyday lives for many months to make sure we are putting out a high quality product. When the time comes to ship the bags, we will be inspecting each item and marking them with our Monarc seal of quality assurance.</p>
<p>Reusability and recyclability</p>
<p>We appreciate your trust in Monarc and in return we want to assure you that our products are built to be reliable, tough, and have your back for all of your adventures. That’s why The Settra Series is backed by a lifetime warranty which means that if any of the products fail to perform, you can send them back to us and we will either repair or replace them with a new item. Exclusions for lifetime guarantee: The guarantee does not cover products that have been neglected, damaged by willful or accidental destruction, or used for unintended purposes. We will however always take back the bags and recycle them in any condition (within reason). We believe in a circular life cycle for our bags and to ensure that no bags end up in the trash, once you are done with the bag, you can send it back to us and we will recycle it! In fact, we plan to incentivize recycling of our bags.</p>
<p>Sustainable materials</p>
<p>All of our bags are made using certified Global Recycled Standard RPET fabric made from recycled plastic bottles. By choosing to use recycled fabric instead of virgin fabric, we are not only diverting plastic waste from our oceans and landfills into long lasting sustainable products, we are also reducing our CO2 emissions during production by up to 79%.</p>
<p>Environmentally friendly factories</p>
<p>When choosing our factory we wanted to make sure that social compliance and supply chain were certified and documented. Our factory holds both SedEx and BSCI certifications as well as Disney and Walmart approved audits. This ensures a sustainable supply chain as well as healthy work environment for the amazing people building our products.</p>
<p>Sustainable Distribution</p>
<p>Our commitment to sustainability doesn't stop with the products. We are going to make sure that all packaging, down to the tape used to close the boxes, will be plastic-free. Instead of packing and shipping The Settra Series in giant poly bags (which are terrible for the environment), we have designed individual large drawstring bags that our products will be shipped in using our certified RPET fabric, which can be used to store the bags or for other uses.</p>

The tent made by Karsten tenten in The Netherlands will last a lifetime. Each is designed by the team from Hamwells.

The shower incorporates a <strong>sediment tank</strong>, a thick <strong>replaceable mechanical 40 micron</strong> non-woven polypropylene micro filter and an optional<strong> UV-C purification light</strong>. UV-C is well known nowadays for its disinfectant properties and is extensively used in many industries to get rid of bacteria and viruses. It has a specific wavelength of light that is also emitted by our sun, but luckily blocked by our ozone layer. It has the ability to destroy the molecular bonds in the DNA of viruses and bacteria, effectively rendering them inactive.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://hamwells.com/Buildup_Loopz.gif"" src="""" style=""width:100%;""/></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Perks</strong></h3><p>The Filtration Module is designed with<strong> robustness and simplicity</strong> in mind. It houses a cleaning system and all necessary electronic components. The Filtration Module can be placed on the floor, either outside or in your campervan. From the Filtration Module the water is pumped to the shower head.</p><p> </p><h3>
<strong>Two-  or  Three-stage filtration?</strong> </h3><p>To clarify, there are <strong>two different kinds of Filtration Modules</strong>: Loopz Filtration Module Basic and Loopz Filtration Module. The difference between these two is using an <strong>UV-C light or not</strong>. The UV-C light (included in the Loopz Filtration Module) fights bacteria and viruses, the Loopz Filtration Module Basic only filters those bigger than 40 micron by the PP microfilter. Depending on how you intend to use the Loopz Module, both the two- and three-stage filtration provide a great shower experience.</p><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603109873/xjfwmohr8w7zraruop4l.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603113860/zbyl3cor00ebxwtxpj1z.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>The Shower Head</strong></h3><p>It sounds a bit silly...

<strong>The Adapters</strong> </h3><p>Loopz requires one <strong>12VDC power supply</strong> for the pump, UV-C light, everything.

The Loopz Filtration Module has a short cable with a heavy duty, waterproof and compact connector. To connect Loopz to a power source, you can select four additional ""add-on"" perks. We offer both a <strong>5 meter and 10 meter extension cord</strong>. We also offer a 100-240VAC to 12V adapter (plug depending on your country) and a converter to a <strong>car lighter outlet</strong>.

This is where we deal with every aspect of the design process, from testing up to assembly.

Hope to hear from you soon! </p></div>","More Info about Loopz? Go to hamwells.com/en/loopz-outdoor-shower/  Portable Circulation ShowerWe think that Loopz is the best portable circulation shower system for outdoor living available today. It combines a high quality shower tent with either the Filtration Module Basic or the advanced shower filtration system called the Loopz Filtration Module. The tent made by Karsten tenten in The Netherlands will last a lifetime. Each is designed by the team from Hamwells. We have years of experience in filtration systems and implemented a unique, robust and easy-to-clean filtration system for Loopz. With this technology we give you the clearest circulated water possible within the boundaries of outdoor travelling.  The Filtration ModuleThe Filtration Module for this outdoor shower was designed with robustness and simplicity in mind. The shower incorporates a sediment tank, a thick replaceable mechanical 40 micron non-woven polypropylene micro filter and an optional UV-C purification light. UV-C is well known nowadays for its disinfectant properties and is extensively used in many industries to get rid of bacteria and viruses. It has a specific wavelength of light that is also emitted by our sun, but luckily blocked by our ozone layer. It has the ability to destroy the molecular bonds in the DNA of viruses and bacteria, effectively rendering them inactive.  PerksThe Filtration Module is designed with robustness and simplicity in mind. It houses a cleaning system and all necessary electronic components. The Filtration Module can be placed on the floor, either outside or in your campervan. From the Filtration Module the water is pumped to the shower head. 
Two-  or  Three-stage filtration? To clarify, there are two different kinds of Filtration Modules: Loopz Filtration Module Basic and Loopz Filtration Module. The difference between these two is using an UV-C light or not. The UV-C light (included in the Loopz Filtration Module) fights bacteria and viruses, the Loopz Filtration Module Basic only filters those bigger than 40 micron by the PP microfilter. Depending on how you intend to use the Loopz Module, both the two- and three-stage filtration provide a great shower experience.  The Shower HeadIt sounds a bit silly... But actually Loopz is the only circulating shower system that we know of to have a proper shower head which you can actually fixate and adjust! This makes Loopz a convenient and comfortable outdoor shower. The LED IndicatorThe LED indicator ring around the stainless steel push button indicates the status of Loopz. When it is flashing on and off it means that the Filtration Module is on, but there is not enough water yet, when the LED is fully on it means it’s shower time! Push the button and Loopz starts. While running the LED indicator will softly glow on and off. Push again and Loopz stops at your command. Cleaning ProcessCleaning Loopz is easy. Remove the shower tray and the floor of the modules is completely accessible. Also, the filter can be removed very easily. All electronic components like the pump and level sensor are easy to access and can even be removed from the bracket if needed.
The Adapters Loopz requires one 12VDC power supply for the pump, UV-C light, everything. There are many ways to hook up your electrical equipment and we have tried to accommodate most of them. The Loopz Filtration Module has a short cable with a heavy duty, waterproof and compact connector. To connect Loopz to a power source, you can select four additional ""add-on"" perks. We offer both a 5 meter and 10 meter extension cord. We also offer a 100-240VAC to 12V adapter (plug depending on your country) and a converter to a car lighter outlet. New is our option to connect Loopz to an USB-C power source, for example a powerbank.  TeamOur Loopz team is part of the Hamwells design and engineering department. Hamwells has been developing intelligent and sustainable shower systems for years. Our office & factory are located in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. This is where we deal with every aspect of the design process, from testing up to assembly.

<div>
<p>No matter the size of your feet or the shoes you put them in, the magic number is 37.5.</p>
<p>Some of you might recognize that as the ideal body temperature for humans, 37.5ºC. It’s also the ideal relative humidity of the microclimate next to our skin.</p>
<p>37.5 technology can <strong>regulate the temperature of your feet stay at 37.5ºC.</strong> <strong>When you feel cold, Magic Socks will warm you up. When you’re hot, they’ll cool you down, </strong>keeping your body in ideal condition.</p>

<p>There are plenty more benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Temperature management;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Fast dry;</strong></li>
<li><strong>Never washed out.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The functionality of 37.5 technology has been proven by various agencies and is used by some professional sports apparel brands.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Machine Washable</strong></h3>
<p>Just pop Merino wool socks in with the rest of your laundry! No one wants socks you have to wash separately from another laundry. That’s just hassle you could do without. So we’ve ensured our Merino socks are machine washable. We apply <strong>Naturetexx® Plasma technology</strong> to make sure our merino wool socks are exceptionally easy to care for. <strong>They’re happy in a regular cold wash and they won’t shrink.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>70% High-Performance Merino Wool </strong></h3>
<p>Our wool comes from the Merino sheep in Australia, known as the<strong> finest wool in the world</strong>. It wicks off sweat and balances your temperature naturally. <strong>Why 70%? With 37.5 technology blended, it is the highest Merino wool ratio</strong> that can not only ensure warmth and comfort but also ensure the durability of socks.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601031054/yrxwlw32ypygnlswm1ar.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3><strong>MP Special Yarn-Make foot odors a thing of the past</strong></h3>
<p>Our socks aren’t just designed to control the temperature of your feet. They also feature an MP special yarn for odor control. This is achieved thanks to the presence of 3 metals in the yarn: Silver, Copper, and Zinc.</p>
<p>Together, this trio reduces the bacteria that can cause foot odors. We’re careful to infuse all three within the fabric of the socks, so <strong>no matter how many times you wash your socks, these odor-killing elements will remain active.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ready to wear. Ready for wear and tear</strong></p>
<p>MP Magic 37.5 tech Merino wool socks reduce impact and pressure during intense training sessions, so you get more wear out of your socks. Reinforced knitting on the heel strengthens the wear resistance and burst resistance function.</p>

<p><strong>Shaped for ultimate comfort</strong></p>
<p>Magic socks do the simple things brilliantly too. The socks are designed to be slightly higher on one side than the other. Like making sure you know which sock goes on which foot to avoid cross-contamination thanks to handy L and R markings on each sock. Reinforced stitching on the toe brings strength to these high wear areas.</p>

The Wool Socks Game Changer
One year ago the first generation of MP Merino wool socks was launched and sold to over 160 countries. Feedback from customers and media was incredible. And now we're happy to announce our new socks:
37.5 Technology+70% Merino wool+MP Special Yarn+LYCRA®= MP Magic 37.5 Tech Merino Wool Socks!





 
Your New Favorite Winter Socks
The moment you put on your first pair of MP Magic 37.5 Tech Merino wool socks, you will feel the delightful difference. Perfect for home, work, and outdoor. Enjoy the features, love the feel. Make MP Merino Wool Socks your new comfortable favorite.

 
37.5 Technology Yarn

No matter the size of your feet or the shoes you put them in, the magic number is 37.5.
Some of you might recognize that as the ideal body temperature for humans, 37.5ºC. It’s also the ideal relative humidity of the microclimate next to our skin.
37.5 technology can regulate the temperature of your feet stay at 37.5ºC. When you feel cold, Magic Socks will warm you up. When you’re hot, they’ll cool you down, keeping your body in ideal condition.

There are plenty more benefits:

Temperature management;
Fast dry;
Never washed out.

The functionality of 37.5 technology has been proven by various agencies and is used by some professional sports apparel brands.
 
Machine Washable
Just pop Merino wool socks in with the rest of your laundry! No one wants socks you have to wash separately from another laundry. That’s just hassle you could do without. So we’ve ensured our Merino socks are machine washable. We apply Naturetexx® Plasma technology to make sure our merino wool socks are exceptionally easy to care for. They’re happy in a regular cold wash and they won’t shrink.


 
70% High-Performance Merino Wool 
Our wool comes from the Merino sheep in Australia, known as the finest wool in the world. It wicks off sweat and balances your temperature naturally. Why 70%? With 37.5 technology blended, it is the highest Merino wool ratio that can not only ensure warmth and comfort but also ensure the durability of socks.

 
MP Special Yarn-Make foot odors a thing of the past
Our socks aren’t just designed to control the temperature of your feet. They also feature an MP special yarn for odor control. This is achieved thanks to the presence of 3 metals in the yarn: Silver, Copper, and Zinc.
Together, this trio reduces the bacteria that can cause foot odors. We’re careful to infuse all three within the fabric of the socks, so no matter how many times you wash your socks, these odor-killing elements will remain active.

 
Superior Comfort & Details
Tightening Design Hugs Your Sock Cuff, Ankle, And Arch
LYCRA® + TIGHTENING DESIGN = AWESOME COMFORT.


 
Cushion Shockproofing

It helps avoid sports injuries and reduce the chances of blisters. During long walks, stressful commutes, tough workouts, you name it, our socks keep foot fatigue at bay.

 
More breathability, less sweat
It’s all thanks to the mesh design with 37.5 yarn on the instep.

 
Ready to wear. Ready for wear and tear
MP Magic 37.5 tech Merino wool socks reduce impact and pressure during intense training sessions, so you get more wear out of your socks. Reinforced knitting on the heel strengthens the wear resistance and burst resistance function.

 
Shaped for ultimate comfort
Magic socks do the simple things brilliantly too. The socks are designed to be slightly higher on one side than the other. Like making sure you know which sock goes on which foot to avoid cross-contamination thanks to handy L and R markings on each sock. Reinforced stitching on the toe brings strength to these high wear areas.

Durable
MP Magic37.5 Tech Merino Wool Socks are very durable since we apply Lycra and Nylon to strength toughness. And our socks are also blended Naturetexx® Plasma technology, so they can be machine washable and will not shrink.

 
For any occasion and activity
Enjoyment at home, for daily work, or for outdoor camping. MP Magic 37.5 Tech Merino Wool Socks are always the most suitable and comfortable pair you own.

 
Proven Reliable

Sustainably Sourced & Eco-Friendly

We care deeply about environmental protection. Sustainable development is a central goal.

Please visit www.RUX.life to pre-order your RUX. Thanks**RUX is the new all-in-one system to pack, move, and use your valuable gear. Garage to the beach. Truck to the trailhead. Ready when you need it. Just pack, grab ‘n go.  Protect your gear, protect your time, protect yourself from junk show packing. RUX helps you do what you do best — make time and space for the good life.This is the last tote you’ll ever need.    Love the outdoor life? Relish the rush you get from being outside — camping, kayaking, skiing, mountain biking, or just chilling on the beach?But packing and moving all your equipment is a total hassle, right? Trying to fit your gear in flimsy duffel bags that carry too little, or wrangling hard-to-manage bins that suck the fun out of the whole trip. Then reverse it, again and again.You need a seamless solution for organization and transportation, so nothing pulls you away from living in the moment.We felt the same way. That’s why we created RUX.  Wanting your gear accessible and protected when you’re outdoors is pretty much a given. You shouldn’t have to worry about your precious equipment getting damaged. Yet, most gear cases, bins, and bags aren’t built to withstand the demands of the outdoors, plus they have non-existent organizational abilities.  Every RUX comes standard with lid, handle straps, and shoulder straps. The clear window allows you to see contents, the boxlike shape makes for max packing efficiency, and the utility rails make for infinite versatility and future potential. Volume: 70L​Empty weight: 4.4 lbs / 2 kg Dimensions (width x length x depth): 15.7 x 19.5 x 13.8 inches / 40 x 50 x 35 cm   Every RUX comes with lid, handle straps, and shoulder straps. But you can also grab add-ons to RUX up your life.  Buy as a BundleGet the best deal with a bundle. When you buy a RUX bundle, you not only get RUX 70L, but several add-on accessories too. And when they come in a bundle, you get a sweet discount.A standard bundle includes your RUX 70L (with lid, handle straps, and shoulder straps standard), plus:
2 nesting tote dividers
1 removable EDC pouch
2 utility straps
Some bundles include multiple sets or other customizations so RUX can meet your adventure needs precisely. Choose the perfect bundle for you!Purchase Add-ons IndividuallyNot ready to bundle? If you're looking to add even more accessories, or just to purchase one at a time, you can do that too. Just go through the RUX purchase process, then choose one (or more) accessories at the final step. Choose between the add-ons above, plus:Slatwall HooksYes, that's right—the slatwall hooks are only available as an individual add-on at the end of the purchase process.Stretch Goal Reached! We Unlocked Green!With your help, we surpassed our $200k USD stretch goal threshold just in time - so we've unlocked a second color option. With help from our backers, we selected green for the second RUX colorway. At the end of the campaign, you'll get to select which color of RUX you'd like - tan or green. Or grab two RUX and get both colors. Want to talk with our team about what'll best meet your needs? Contact us anytime. Check out the Mountain Life article including an exclusive interview.“We looked at how the intermodal shipping container revolutionized industrial transport,” says Jamie Bond, who joined Andre and Tony as the third leg in the RUX tripod. “Those shipping containers are the best system for storing goods, but they’re also perfect for transporting them across the sea or land. We wanted something that could be just as versatile and useful for our gear.”  You’ve seen the basics. From there, RUX is up to you.  #1 Pop OpenFor easy access and organization, RUX pops open and stays upright. You get fast and easy access to the full 70L of volume with no space wasted.
#2 OrganizeStow all your gear neatly. RUX's box-like shape, optional divider totes and removable pouches make it dead-simple to stay organized and ready. #3 SecureClose the lid to keep your gear secure and dry. The rainproof lid can be secured with two nylon webbing straps & buckles, or further backed up by tightening the red shoulder straps onto the lid.
#4 MoveStash RUX in the trunk of your car, on a shelf, cubby or rail in your van, or use the utility rail to lash your RUX to your roof rack, boat, snowmobile or ATV. #5 CarryEasily configure your quick release straps to carry RUX like a backpack, tote, shoulder bag, or bin (your choice). RUX frees up your hands for other gear or allows you to carry 3 at a time when you're hauling all that gear to camp or the cabin.
#6 Grab ’n GoEasily access your gear when you need it. RUX makes a perfect base camp to stage from when you get to the beach, crag, trail, you name it. Your gear is organized and easy to grab.
#7 StowPack RUX flat to store it out of the way when its only partially packed or empty. Huge win for the end of a road trip or in between trips.   What makes RUX different from the rest? Design for DisassemblyFirst, we design and build RUX to last and stay relevant for a lifetime, with durable materials and modular design. Then, if part of your RUX eventually breaks, we’ve designed it for incredibly easy field repair or efficient product servicing. And finally, after a life well lived, RUX can be broken into components and individual materials, with the long term goal of making it fully recyclable.The concept is still a work in progress, but we're actively working on it and are thrilled with the potential. After all, you can build bags out of recycled pop bottles all you want, but when that zipper breaks and that whole bag just ends up in the trash then is it really sustainable?Sustainability is one of our core values at RUX. We are proud new members of 1% For The Planet and are actively pursuing other sustainable business commitments as RUX comes to life.  Future-ReadyRUX is the world's first fully-adaptive system. Unlike any other bag or gear case, your RUX will get better with every future product release. From adaptors to accessories, the RUX suite of customized solutions will only grow. And we’ve designed RUX to be ready for open source, so other brands and DIY makers can augment the core structure. RUX is always exploring new frontiers, like you.  Built for AgilityWe could have made RUX impenetrable, with sides as thick as your thumb. But heavy, bearproof containers have already been done.We’re about lightweight travel, nimble solutions to keep you on the go. Your gear should be as mobile as you are. That’s why RUX weighs in at a feather-light 4.4 lbs (2kg). Haul your stuff, not the dead weight of a heavy container. RUX holds twice the volume of popular outdoor totes at half the weight.    The year: 2019. The place: The wild coast of British Columbia, where three gear junkies set out to unlock the secret of a more agile lifestyle. Combining their skill sets and decades of experience in industrial design, entrepreneurship and operations, they were on a mission to free up more time, space, and energy for spontaneous adventure. Answering the call for a new way to pack, move, and use our gear so we can all spend our time answering the call of the trails, rivers, and mountains around us. Our mission is to make space for the good life outdoors by creating the most agile and sustainable systems for people to manage and move their gear. We live and breathe the outdoors. Just look at our designer Tony. Give Tony five minutes to leave the design studio, and you’ll find him halfway across the river in his packraft enroute to a 48-hour self-propelled mountain adventure from here to who-knows-where and back.  Would you like to purchase a quantity of RUX you don't see on the perks menu?Contact us: Live chat via Messenger or use ASK A QUESTION at the top of the page. Or, reach Jamie directly at jamie@rux.life.  Buying RUX is like investing in a loyal, lifelong outdoor partner. You can count on RUX being functional, free of defects, and adaptable to your ever-changing needs. Not only will we do everything we can to keep it in your life, but we’ll also keep as much as we can out of the trash by continually improving our design for recyclability. RUX is backed with a no-hassle lifetime warranty. Our warranty covers manufacturing defects and failures or breakages that render part or all of your product to become non-functional. Our warranty does not cover blemishes, wear & tear, failures caused by intentional damage, misuse, or by product not being used as intended.  This campaign is a pre-order for our product, so the funds raised through Indiegogo will be used to manufacture RUX for our backers. In accordance with Indiegogo Terms of Use, we will not offer refunds or return for items that are not defective. All RUX come with a lifetime warranty, so in the unlikely event that you receive a faulty product, please contact us at warranty@rux.life.Wait, what's with that QR code I keep seeing in the RUX window?Like all things RUX, we're future-proofing and thinking big. By shipping every RUX with an individual QR code, we can build out infinite back-end features online to help you manage and move your gear. From personal solutions like warranty registration and packing lists to commercial applications for inventory management, this nifty little QR code can do it all. Watch this space. We know the good life happens anytime, anywhere - so we’re offering international shipping. Please note we’re not responsible for additional duty and taxes that may apply to your local importation laws.We are including FREE shipping to USA & Canada addresses. For international shipping, we offer a discounted shipping rate of $15 to many locations, and $30 to remaining destinations.For US and Canada fulfillment, rewards will first be sent via sea (which takes around 21 days) from our factory to our 3PL warehouse in North America and then be shipped to the US and Canada addresses via DHL or UPS tracked shipping via Easyship. North American backers are expected to receive rewards within 3-8 days from our 3PL's warehouse. Indiegogo is powered by a curiosity-driven community of people just like us. We’ve identified a crux in our own lives and we’re not going to settle for the status quo. We know there’s a better way to manage and move your gear, and we’re hell-bent on creating the best solution to make it faster, easier and more fun to get outside or on the road, whenever the opportunity strikes.We’re a small team of passionate individuals, and we’ve embarked on one hell of an adventure. With the support of Indiegogo’s community, we can bring this crazy idea to life. To show our support, backers will get RUX for a discounted price, and the earliest deliveries. RUX’s final MSRP pricing may change when it’s officially available on the market. Based in Squamish, BC, the self-titled “Outdoor Capital of Canada,” our immediate community is made of elite mountain athletes and professional mountain guides, many of whom also use their rigging skills for rope access and other industrial applications. We’re honored to have such a high-calibre community of testers available to us when each new RUX iteration comes out of our design studio doors. We are ready to manufacture RUX after the completion of this campaign. We’ve successfully built manufacturable prototypes that we’re using daily. We’ve already made a huge commitment by investing in the tooling for our 70L RUX, and we are building 50 production-ready samples to test, toss around, and tumble so any kinks are worked out by the time you get your RUX.The main project risk is manufacturing and delivery timing. To date, the global pandemic has not directly impacted on our timing, but we acknowledge the trickle-down effects are unknown. RUX is also a new product to be built by two different manufacturing partners, so there could be surprises in our production and delivery timeline. We have already added an entire month to be safe. We’ve planned ahead to expect the unexpected while getting your RUX to you on time.Questions? Our team is ready to help out.",69.0,2,"1 Campaign

Backed by 10 years of research and tested in the field by paramedics, emergency physicians, Navy SEALs and a NASA flight surgeon, HÉROS are the most powerful shears you’ve ever encountered.  This reinvented necessity combines 8 tools in 1, including trauma shears, ripper, window punch, ring cutter, oxygen tank key and hex key into a single, easy-access tool with superior durability. Cuts through anything with razor-sharp precision and the power of a great white shark’s bite, including:   HÉROS Trauma Shears cut through anything with intensity and ease because they are modeled after the bite of a Great White Shark.Sharks' teeth have a unique serration pattern that makes them powerful shearing machines. We replicated that serration pattern in the HÉROS blades so you can expose injuries quicker and easier every time you reach for your shears.  On top of this one-of-a-kind biomimicry, we precisely designed the blade length and handle pivot point for minimal effort and maximum force.
Shears cuts and rips over and over again without dulling 
Engages materials without snags, catching or bunching
Cuts without blades twisting or bending, even with maximum force
 Ultimate cutting performance comes down to the quality of the steel.Our blades are made from Japanese AUS-8 steel alloy​ for its strength, rust-resistance and ease of maintenance. AUS-8 steel’s composition, in conjunction with our heat-treating process, creates an extremely hard material that’s resistant to corrosion and can maintain a razor-sharp edge. HÉROS offers 8 tools in one so you can carry everything you need on your person and don’t waste precious time switching from one tool to another.  Emergency situations require precision down to the second, so why are trauma shears throw-away quality? Hobbyists often spend upwards of $200 on knives for hunting, fishing or EDC, yet those tasked with saving lifes are using ""freebie"" trauma shears that are only good for one use. Patients deserve better. Garbage shears stop here. Frequency of sharpening depends on how often you use the shears and what they are used on. We recommend sharpening every 3-5 years with regular use.  Emergency physician Scott Forman created Héros shears because he was frustrated with the poor design and disposable quality of standard trauma shears.After developing prototypes in his garage in New Mexico, he teamed up with Sandia National Laboratories (America’s nuclear weapons engineering lab) to take his brainchild to the next level.  In an emergency, you can’t afford to make mistakes. Héros grips are ambidextrous and designed to give you multiple grip options (including with thick gloves) so you can deliver the right amount of force in different situations. Héros elastomer finger grips are overmoulded directly onto the fully tanged blades. This soft, textured material provides comfort and a secure hold that reduces hand and wrist fatigue.  The integrated carabiner* clip ensures HÉROS are always there when you need them. Attach HÉROS to your belt loop, gear bag or backpack (accommodates MOLLE).*The carabiner clip has not been tested or rated for load bearing functions; it is solely for ease of access (e.g., not for use in climbing or rescue applications).  Héros Shears meet TSA carry-on requirements, and have traveled in carry-on luggage on multiple flights, both within the U.S. and internationally. Héros Shears is the hero of your everyday carry. It’s your must-have when you're on the job or off the beaten path, leave for the job or go backcountry. This life-saving device is an essential tool for first responders, EMS and military.

<p>With the constant hustle of day-to-day life, it is easy to become exhausted and burn out. Excessive screen time and social media add to these problems by overwhelming us with constant negativity, especially in recent times. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><img alt=""ezgif-3-d5f616ec98f6"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.ibb.co/C5YxP2V/ezgif-3-d5f616ec98f6.gif"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Initially, my father and I just intended to design functional bags to sell in our online store. When the pandemic started, we were overwhelmed with the constant negative news on social media, especially as small business owners.</p>
<p>Then we asked ourselves, ""<strong>What if these bags also helped people unplug?</strong>""</p>
<p>While it was a crazy idea, it made sense to us: Products we use throughout our day that also remind us to practice healthier habits (like stepping away from our screens), especially in these trying times.</p>
<p>Fast forward to now, we’re proud to introduce the Soul Search Series, the first bags ever to integrate the organizational needs of daily life with the benefits of unplugging.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602483511/wxqelmn48nyzevejt9nl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>These products emphasize the importance of mindfulness and momentarily disconnecting from your phone through a few key design elements.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603696086/axmnrwdxyzmlbqhnvr3q.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Those texts and work emails can wait until after you regain some mental clarity. Each bag has a special compartment lined with <strong>RFID signal-blocking technology</strong> so you can shut out all the noise in one zip. Since there's no need to power off, you can quickly access your phone for any emergencies without waiting for it to turn back on.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602566324/x7tffqfqi2taxckye5tz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The tech lock-away helps you truly rest by disconnecting from your phone and social media.</p>
<p>On the Hybrid Pack, the tech lock-away is embedded right outside the laptop compartment so you truly unplug from your work emails and social media.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.ibb.co/zFQWFV4/Laptop-Lock.gif"" src=""""/></h3>

<p>Meanwhile, on the No-Tech Pouch, the tech lock-away is installed outside the main compartment to keep your phone and personal belongings locked away so you can reconnect with everything around you.</p>

<p>We understand that many crowdfunding projects fail to deliver. However, we have experience in online business and have gone the extra mile to minimize any risks that may arise. If any issues arise, we promise to notify our backers immediately and transparently. </p>
<p>Below are reasons why we are confident about keeping our promise to our backers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Years of experience in e-commerce</strong>:  We have been in the e-commerce space for years, working with manufacturers and delivering products on multiple online channels. We understand all the components of the supply chain and the ins and outs of manufacturing and delivering our products.</li>
<li>
<strong>Zero language barrier</strong>:  Many times, US-based companies miscommunicate with their overseas suppliers, resulting in headaches for themselves and their customers. However, my father's first language is Vietnamese, which enables us to have a very good communicative relationship with our manufacturer in Vietnam. All the product specs and delivery deadlines have been thoroughly discussed and hammered down to the tee. </li>
<li>
<strong>Skilled and vetted factory</strong>:  While Vietnam is arguably the best country to manufacture bags, we went the extra mile and implemented a rigorous auditing process of our partnered factory. We have ensured that the factory has the capability to produce and deliver our products at the quality, efficiency, and scale that we need while paying their workers a living wage. </li>
<li>
<strong>Trusted fulfillment partners</strong>:  Logistics and fulfillment can be nightmares for some project creators. However, we have partnered with industry leading logistics company ShipMonk, to better ensure that the products get to our backers without issues.</li>
<li>
<strong>Built-in cushion in our timeline</strong>:  We understand that it is extremely disappointing when project creators do not deliver in a timely manner. Aside from our partnerships mentioned above, we have also built in a cushion in our timeline to better ensure that our backers are happy and never disappointed.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Warranty &amp; Return Policy</h3>
<p>We're proud to offer a lifetime warranty on our bags. We will repair or replace any bags with manufacturing defects. We do not offer refunds or returns on bags that were received as an Indiegogo reward. </p>
<p>We’re passionate about creating amazing products and Indiegogo is a way for us to expand our brand. Indiegogo rewards are a thanks for supporting the project which is why we cannot offer refunds or returns. Your pledge means a lot to us and we take it very seriously. We will do anything we can to make sure that this is a 100% positive experience for everyone involved.</p>

With the constant hustle of day-to-day life, it is easy to become exhausted and burn out. Excessive screen time and social media add to these problems by overwhelming us with constant negativity, especially in recent times. 
 



Initially, my father and I just intended to design functional bags to sell in our online store. When the pandemic started, we were overwhelmed with the constant negative news on social media, especially as small business owners.
Then we asked ourselves, ""What if these bags also helped people unplug?""
While it was a crazy idea, it made sense to us: Products we use throughout our day that also remind us to practice healthier habits (like stepping away from our screens), especially in these trying times.
Fast forward to now, we’re proud to introduce the Soul Search Series, the first bags ever to integrate the organizational needs of daily life with the benefits of unplugging.
 
 

These products emphasize the importance of mindfulness and momentarily disconnecting from your phone through a few key design elements.

Those texts and work emails can wait until after you regain some mental clarity. Each bag has a special compartment lined with RFID signal-blocking technology so you can shut out all the noise in one zip. Since there's no need to power off, you can quickly access your phone for any emergencies without waiting for it to turn back on.



The tech lock-away helps you truly rest by disconnecting from your phone and social media.
On the Hybrid Pack, the tech lock-away is embedded right outside the laptop compartment so you truly unplug from your work emails and social media.

 
Meanwhile, on the No-Tech Pouch, the tech lock-away is installed outside the main compartment to keep your phone and personal belongings locked away so you can reconnect with everything around you.
 

 
 
This lock is also an optional feature, so it is up to your intention and choice to disconnect from your devices in any particular moment or not. It also doubles as an anti-theft feature.


Our zipper pulls are thoughtfully embossed with a symbol of the breath, serving as a tactile reminder to return your attention to the breath whenever it is touched. 
​


The Soul Search Series consists of two innovative bags - the Hybrid Pack and No-Tech Pouch. These bags combine optimum functionality with elements that assist you in obtaining better headspace, all in a single sleek and meticulous design. 



 Elastic organization grid for superior tech & cable management.

Ample storage for all your tech & cables.
 
Quick & easy access.
 

The No-Tech Pouch can double as a sling bag by attaching the removable strap with aluminum hooks and a Fidlock magnetic buckle.
 

Magnetic Fidlock buckle for easy and secure carry.
 

The No-Tech Pouch is a versatile bag for organizing your tech and daily carry. Simply attach the strap whenever you want to take your gear on the go.
 
 


Stay travel and road trip ready.
 

Compressible shoe compartment to make the most out of your main compartment when not in use.
 

Pack for the gym or weekend trips with a spacious main compartment.
 

Pockets on pockets on pockets.
 

The strap attaches for duffle carry and can be worn as a hip belt (not pictured).
 

The Hybrid Pack contains ample amounts of compartments and organizational features to help you reduce the stress of finding items in your bag. Each compartment of this bag has a purpose so that you can focus on what truly matters instead. 
 
COMPARISON CHART



 
 







Since our founding, we have fulfilled over 15,000 products on multiple online channels and developed a track record of consistently providing excellent customer service. In gratitude for our backers' support of our vision, we will go the extra mile to provide an experience as positive and seamless as possible when it's time for fulfillment.

 



At Here & Now Supply, we value honesty and integrity. So we firmly believe that you should know exactly what your pledge funds will towards.  Funds raised from this project will go towards our important expenses, such as:

Recovering from COVID-19's negative impact on sales
Manufacturing more bags for post-campaign orders
Marketing expenses to grow our business
Creating more mindfulness-inspired products

 



We understand that many crowdfunding projects fail to deliver. However, we have experience in online business and have gone the extra mile to minimize any risks that may arise. If any issues arise, we promise to notify our backers immediately and transparently. 
Below are reasons why we are confident about keeping our promise to our backers:


Years of experience in e-commerce:  We have been in the e-commerce space for years, working with manufacturers and delivering products on multiple online channels. We understand all the components of the supply chain and the ins and outs of manufacturing and delivering our products.

Zero language barrier:  Many times, US-based companies miscommunicate with their overseas suppliers, resulting in headaches for themselves and their customers. However, my father's first language is Vietnamese, which enables us to have a very good communicative relationship with our manufacturer in Vietnam. All the product specs and delivery deadlines have been thoroughly discussed and hammered down to the tee. 

Skilled and vetted factory:  While Vietnam is arguably the best country to manufacture bags, we went the extra mile and implemented a rigorous auditing process of our partnered factory. We have ensured that the factory has the capability to produce and deliver our products at the quality, efficiency, and scale that we need while paying their workers a living wage. 

Trusted fulfillment partners:  Logistics and fulfillment can be nightmares for some project creators. However, we have partnered with industry leading logistics company ShipMonk, to better ensure that the products get to our backers without issues.

Built-in cushion in our timeline:  We understand that it is extremely disappointing when project creators do not deliver in a timely manner. Aside from our partnerships mentioned above, we have also built in a cushion in our timeline to better ensure that our backers are happy and never disappointed.

 
Warranty & Return Policy
We're proud to offer a lifetime warranty on our bags. We will repair or replace any bags with manufacturing defects. We do not offer refunds or returns on bags that were received as an Indiegogo reward. 
We’re passionate about creating amazing products and Indiegogo is a way for us to expand our brand. Indiegogo rewards are a thanks for supporting the project which is why we cannot offer refunds or returns. Your pledge means a lot to us and we take it very seriously. We will do anything we can to make sure that this is a 100% positive experience for everyone involved.

A backpack for a lifetime, designed to meet modern-day travelers' needs, from your daily journey to work to long-distance hikes across the country.    
Pre-order now, pay when the campaign is overAfter creating the two most crowdfunded shoes in history we are back to share our latest project with you.


 
 We are millions of people looking for the same thing: How to pack and save space. Why just toss your clothes in your bag?  We have found the answer to that question... Put them in an organized, easy-to-access wardrobe with a built-in compression system.



Color and shipping info will be collected at the end of the campaign. See FAQs for more details. We’ve successfully combined the ergonomics and benefits of a large hiking pack, with the portability and minimalist design of a daily use backpack. 
 
 
 

 


 

An inbuilt wardrobe system that helps save up to 20% more space. Remove it from the backpack, pack your things, compress it down, and like magic it fits perfectly inside your Shell. 
Combine these specially designed accessories with the Shell backpack to obtain the ultimate daily-to-travel ecosystem, so you can be ready for any adventure, anywhere, anytime.


 
We know details make perfection, that’s why we’ve packed Shell with all the features and details you would expect from a premium backpack and the ones you’ve been asking for all this time. Excelling in every single department.   

 
 
 
Made with foam for scapular and lumbar support with dual-channel airflow to allow breathability.
 
Frontal straps that use an offloading mechanism so you can control how high or low the Shell sits.
 
Use this to transfer weight from your shoulders to your hips.
 
To help disperse the weight off your shoulders and stops them from getting sore.
 
Store the straps and handles away by tucking them behind this elastic band.
 
You can also carry your Shell by using either the top handle or the handle found at the side.
 
 
 

  
At Tropicfeel, we pride ourselves on the power of collaboration. Our community was essential in the co-creation of the Shell backpack. This is why to develop this Shell we listened to the needs, feedback, and opinions of over 5000 travelers.
5,000 travelers helped us on developing the Shell backpack.
 With a Super Early Bird discount for a limited time only.

<p>Why do we need Glovax? Our hands are our most valuable tool in most activities, and they require protection during strenuous activity. There are gloves on the market that can protect your hands, but many of them are cumbersome, and inflexible. You could bring multiple pairs of uncomfortable, cumbersome gloves with you on your adventures, or you could use one, multi-purpose, comfortable adventure glove.</p>

Even natural dyes can have detrimental impacts on the environment as they often require high concentrations of salt, higher amounts of water, higher quantities of the dye and/or higher concentrations or unenvironmental mordants. Bleaching and dying of the original Scrubba wash bag is optimised to use just 300ml of water.  However, this is still 300ml of water that needs to be treatment before it can be reused.</p><p>For many dyed textiles, waste water isn't adequately treated.  Indeed, it is estimated that up to 17-20% of industrial water pollution is from fabric dyes and treatment.  For every pound of textiles produced in Indonesia, a pound of chemicals is broken-down and later illegally bled into the Citarum River.  Pollution of water sources with waste from the dyes and treatment can destroy aquatic life, ruin soils and poison drinking water.  Traditional dying uses 5.8 trillion litres of water each year and 10-20% of the dye remains after dying (plus other chemicals).  391 billion kWh of energy is used for dying processes annually.</p><p> </p><p><i>Information sources:</i></p><p><i><a href=""https://www.carmenbusquets.com/journal/post/fashion-dye-pollution""

environment?</strong></p><p>In addition to selecting the Scrubba wash bag Untouched, we encourage you to reconsider so called ""fast fashion"" purchases.  These are typically cheap clothing that are only ""fashionable"" for a very short period and sparingly worn.  Often cost cutting results in adverse dyes being used and insufficient processing of waste water particularly in India and Bangladesh.  </p><p>Some 85% of all textiles end up in landfill each year and the fashion industry accounts for up to 10% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions and 20% of industrial waste water pollution.  The environmental cost is huge.</p><p>Cherish the clothes you already own and extend their lifespan by purchasing quality clothes that are sustainably produced and that you love enough to wear over and over again.</p><p><i>Source: UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>What else is Scrubba by Calibre8 doing for the environment?</strong></p><p>- We have provided over $60,000

Even natural dyes can have detrimental impacts on the environment as they often require high concentrations of salt, higher amounts of water, higher quantities of the dye and/or higher concentrations or unenvironmental mordants. Bleaching and dying of the original Scrubba wash bag is optimised to use just 300ml of water.  However, this is still 300ml of water that needs to be treatment before it can be reused.For many dyed textiles, waste water isn't adequately treated.  Indeed, it is estimated that up to 17-20% of industrial water pollution is from fabric dyes and treatment.  For every pound of textiles produced in Indonesia, a pound of chemicals is broken-down and later illegally bled into the Citarum River.  Pollution of water sources with waste from the dyes and treatment can destroy aquatic life, ruin soils and poison drinking water.  Traditional dying uses 5.8 trillion litres of water each year and 10-20% of the dye remains after dying (plus other chemicals).  391 billion kWh of energy is used for dying processes annually. Information sources:https://www.carmenbusquets.com/journal/post/fas...Sustainability Challenges of the Textiles, Dyeing and Finishing Industries: Opportunities for Innovation, Dr Richard Blackburn, Sustainable Materials Research Group, University of Leeds, ACS Webinars).How can you minimise the impact of dyes on the environment?In addition to selecting the Scrubba wash bag Untouched, we encourage you to reconsider so called ""fast fashion"" purchases.  These are typically cheap clothing that are only ""fashionable"" for a very short period and sparingly worn.  Often cost cutting results in adverse dyes being used and insufficient processing of waste water particularly in India and Bangladesh.  Some 85% of all textiles end up in landfill each year and the fashion industry accounts for up to 10% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions and 20% of industrial waste water pollution.  The environmental cost is huge.Cherish the clothes you already own and extend their lifespan by purchasing quality clothes that are sustainably produced and that you love enough to wear over and over again.Source: UN Alliance for Sustainable Fashion. What else is Scrubba by Calibre8 doing for the environment?- We have provided over $60,000 for safe water projects in Ethiopia and Bangladesh as well as for disaster relief around the world.- We repurpose/upcycle excess fabric from the manufacture of Scrubba wash bags into useful products (e.g. the Scrubba weightless wallet)- We support working from home (even pre-Covid-19) and also low impact commuting when an office visit is necessary with 50% our staff cycling to work and 25% catching public transport- We share our office space with another company to reduce the impact of heating and cooling the office- We use easy to recycle cardboard packaging for all our products- We are a paperless office- We are avid recyclers- We have converted to rechargeable batteries for all suitable office equipment to avoid battery waste. Prototypes and ManufacturingFor several months we have been working with our manufacturer to create the Scrubba wash bag Untouched and we have several working prototypes and pre-production samples of the Scrubba wash bag Untouched, which are showcased in our video and also product images.  As the Scrubba wash bag Untouched utilises the same tooling, components, technology and design as the original Scrubba wash bag, we are confident that we are creating another high quality, durable product that will be useful for travel and camping.  Our unique undyed and unbleached fabric was ordered before launching on Kickstarter in March 2021 and by reaching our funding goal within 2 hours, we were able to bring forward production.  As shown in the image below, the Scrubba wash bags Untouched and kits are complete and now shipping:   Here is what some of our 240,000+ customers of the original Scrubba wash bag have said:  PerksBy backing our campaign you can select from 2 types of perks.  You can either pick up the new Scrubba wash bag Untouched or you the complete Scrubba wash & dry kit Untouched. Either way, you get great savings on the expected retail pricing.   The items in the Scrubba wash & dry kit Untouched include:Dimensions and capacityThe Scrubba wash bag Untouched weighs around 142g (5 oz.) and measures 54cm x 32cm (when laid flat) - 21.3"" x 12.6"" and  16cm x 6cm x 6cm (when rolled for storage) -  6.3"" x 2.4"" x 2.4"".  The total open volume of the Scrubba wash bag Untouched is around 13 litres, while the working volume is 3-6 litres and can easily wash 2 T-shirts, 2 pairs of underwear and 2 pairs of socks in one load. Australian shippingPlease note that to enable free shipping for Australian orders single wash bags and to minimise waste, Australian orders of the Scrubba wash bag Untouched will be shipped without retail packaging and in branded envelopes.  If you are located in Australia and require retail packaging (e.g. for gifting), please pledge an extra $6.Australian GST is included in our prices for orders shipped to Australian addresses. Global shippingGlobal shipping outside Australia is AUD9.00 to AUD19 (~USD7 to USD15) for the Scrubba wash bag Untouched perk and AUD19.00 to AUD30 (~USD15 to USD23) for the Scrubba Untouched wash & dry kit perk.   If you pledge for multiple units via the add on feature, you won't pay extra for shipping.To keep your shipping costs low, we will be using international economy shipping services.  These services have estimated shipping times to most countries of 2-4 weeks. Some shipments may take longer depending on customs and any COVID restrictions in the recipient's country.  Shipping to remote locations may also take longer.Please note that our prices DO NOT include VAT, GST or other country-specific taxes. Depending on where you are located, you may need to pay import duties or taxes.  Product warrantyWe back all our products with a 12 month warranty against manufacturing defects and the Scrubba wash bag Untouched is no exception.  If a manufacturing defect isn't repairable, we will replace the defective unit.  Our defect rate for other Scrubba products is less than 1% so we are confident that the vast majority of our backers won't have any issues with their Scrubba wash bag Untouched. Timeline Traveller Survey Data and Calculations*Based on user survey data (736 respondents)Scrubba wash bag owners travel longer each trip (15.4 days) than non-owners (11.4 days)Scrubba wash bag owners travel internationally more each year than non-owners (2 trips vs 1.6 trips)Scrubba wash bag owners travel domestically (4.2 times) more each year than non-owners (4.2 trips vs 4 trips)A Scrubba wash bag owner will do an average of 6.5 loads on the average 15.4 day trip and an average of 40 loads each year.Each Scrubba wash bag saves an average of 943 litres (~250 gal) of water each year based on the assumption that while traveling 4 Scrubba wash bag loads equates to the same convenience as a traveller washing 4 days of clothes in a washing machine and the washing machine uses 118 litres of water per load (medium water efficiency).Each Scrubba wash bag saves an average of 21 kWh of electricity each year based on the assumption that while traveling 4 Scrubba wash bag loads equates to the same convenience as a traveller washing 4 days of clothes in a washing machine and the washing machine uses 0.9kWh per load (medium efficiency and 1 h running time).With over 240,000 Scrubba wash bags in circulation, and an assumption that 40% may not be used at all each year, 226,000,000 litres (>59,000,000 gal) are saved each year.  Also, an average of 5,111,000 kWh are saved which is around 1797 tonnes of carbon. Risks and challengesThis is our eighth crowdfunding campaign (the previous 7 were successful on IndieGoGo and Kickstarter) and despite hurdles along the way, we completed and fulfilled both within a few months of the campaigns ending. We have also learned from these experiences, which gives us the confidence that we will be able to ship most (if not all) orders within a month of the campaign closing. On the manufacturing side of the equation, we are sitting pretty. We are able to use the same tooling as the original Scrubba wash bag and we have enough undyed and unbleached fabric for around 1800 units of the Scrubba wash bag Untouched. We have everything we need already. We just need to know that there is enough interest in the product to start production. We believe in honesty and great customer service, so in the unlikely event that a delay does pop up, we will let you know and also provide our strategy for getting back on track. The following are links to our previous crowdfunding campaigns for other products which we delivered on as promised: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/calibre8/s... https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/489632425/... https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/calibre8/s... https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/scrubba-the-... https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-scrubba-... Environmental commitmentsLong-lasting designThe Scrubba wash bag Untouched is made from high quality nylon with a polyether TPU coating, making it lightweight but incredibly durable. All seams are high frequency welded to provide a permanent bond. The Scrubba wash bag Untouched is built to last. Reusability and recyclabilityWe keep packaging to a minimum and use readily recyclable cardboard. For Australian orders, we have an option for no packaging, with the product shipped in a recyclable envelope. In the unlikely event of a backer puncturing their Scrubba wash bag Untouched, we have repair patches that we can send to get their bag working again and prevent landfill. Sustainable materialsWe use TPU in place of PVC, which has a much lower impact on the environment. Omitting dyes and bleaches from production of the fabric further lowers the environmental impact by reducing waste water and electricity usage. Environmentally friendly factoriesThe nature of the Scrubba wash bag Untouched is that the production avoids bleaches and dyes. This means less shipping of raw materials, less waste water production and less electricity used. Other environmental factorsIn addition to the Scrubba wash bag Untouched being unbleached and undyed (saving water and electricity), each product is expected to be used on average 40 times per year (based on a survey of 700 travellers) resulting in each product saving over 1000 litres of water and 21kWh of electricity each year. We also upcycle the offcuts of fabric during production and turn them into lightweight, sweat resistant travel and sports wallets.",21.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Coresport shirts were also tested with professional athlete team and daily using scenario.Akerson is our team member and loves working out! He wore the CoreSport Workout Shirt and a piece of normal workout shirt for 15 minutes running respectively, and we used the Infrared Thermometer to test his back temperature to further confirm the cooling effect of CoreSport. The technology of CoreSport provides a moisture-absorbing, quick dry and breathable garment, designed to keep you comfortable, fresh and UV protected. This product allows for a longer and more enjoyable workout by removing the downsides to working out. Coresport's cooling technology is achieved by the joint action of heat, moisture, and air. This technique works when wearing dry clothes. Through intense work or exercise, or sweating during everyday activities, moisture intervention will quickly produce cooling effects. After rigorous testing, our fabric reduces the skin surface temperature by 30%, thus reducing the effect of core body temperature. The fibers contain the composite powders of zinc, copper, phosphorus and other microelements. The mineral powder containing zinc oxide offers improved UV protection. The microelements, which are absorbed by the skin, can activate cell tissue and improve immune functions reducing the generation of bacteria which will help keep the skin healthy. This reduces odor and rashes often associated with sweating.CoreSport’s design is also unique. The mesh backing increases the skin’s contact with air. This feature allows for faster sweat evaporation, keeping you cooler while active. At the same time, the accelerated airflow increases metabolism and, when mixed with the zinc, increases the amount of calories burned. Click here for the full reviewClick here for the full reviewClick here for the full reviewWe have gone through so many major prototyping stages, measuring and tailoring countless times, including communicated with our KS backers after delivering the pilot batches and finally we complete the design of CoreSport, the satisfying workout shirt, which is comfortable and meets the needs of men and women's body features.Our designer was designing, measuring and tailoring the shirtSamples and modelsThis is not traditional indiegogo crowdfunding campaign!

Unpredictable circumstances like an earthquake, hurricane, or other events could knock out a region's power supply for days. Having a modern, dependable backup power source gives enormous peace of mind. Without it we are unable to keep in touch with others, unable to enjoy entertainment, unable to keep food fresh, and unable to see at night. In other words, deprived of a power source, our quality of life drops to near zero. This absolute reliance on electricity is at odds with the trend towards more flexible lifestyles. Many of us would love to work from the beach or experience life ""off the grid"", but know we can't stray too far from power outlets.We took one look at the existing products in this space and knew immediately we had to do something different. Other power stations and large batteries of this type all look like they're designed to match a set of power tools. They feel like an appliance, something that exists purely to serve a practical purpose and nothing more. 
An outlet you can take anywhere
  The portable power backup redefined. Power video equipment, lighting gear, drones, and much more, all from a stylish little box that weighs just 7.9lb/3.6kg. The PowerStudio 300 is the ultimate solution to the modern need for on-demand electricity wherever you go. PowerStudio 300 is compatible with the vast majority of devices, gadgets, and appliances, including those powered by USB, AC outlets or DC outlets. You can get 110V AC output just like the wall outlet at home, only this is an outlet you can take anywhere. There's also a wide variety of fast-charging USB ports and DC outlets. 297W is enough to power all kinds of beefy appliances, and the huge battery takes a very long time to run down.The only ones to look out for are high-powered appliances rated at more than 300W, which might include things like induction cookers, kettles and hairdryers. Basically everything else should be fine. Here's just a taste of the kind of things you could be powering on a deserted island with your PowerStudio 300.PowerStudio 300 supports USB Power Delivery input/output charging up to 100W via USB-C. To put that in perspective, standard phone charging is only 5W, most phones fast-charge up to a maximum of about 18W, a MacBook Air charges at 30W, and the 16"" MacBook Pro accepts up to 96W. In other words, 100W USB charging is more than enough for any mobile device or laptop.The same port can be used for input or output, adding to the convenience. There are also four regular USB-A ports, two of which support Quick Charge 3.0, which can fast-charge a wide variety of Android smartphones at the maximum rate they support. With PowerStudio 300, we purposefully set out to create a product without equivalent, and a big part of that is in the retro styling. This is something that won't look out of place at a party or at a music festival. It's not a workman's tool, it's your companion for an off-the-grid lifestyle.This funky little package has unique “modern vintage” styling that sets it clearly apart from other power stations, which are no more than a bland workaday power appliance. PowerStudio 300 is the kind of tech you’d happily keep in your living room, rather than hiding away in the tool shed. It combines all the benefits of power banks and gas generators without the drawbacks. That means total silence, completely clean, vastly powerful, and a huge capacity. For Work, Rest and PlayA product like this has an almost infinite number of usage scenarios. You can power pretty much any device, gadget, or appliance you can think of, anywhere you care to travel. Here are just a few ideas:Solo Camper:Campers have long been using traditional generators and gadgets powered from their car's cigarette lighter, but there's no question the PowerStudio 300 is several steps up from that.Not only is it far cleaner, lighter, and more portable than a clunky generator (not to mention better looking), with all the different port options it's also far more versatile. It will barely weigh down your camping luggage but will make your time in the great outdoors far more enjoyable. What could be better than a chilled can of beer on a hot summer's day far from the city, or a stuffy tent ventilated by an electric fan?You can also keep your laptop and all your other devices fully charged throughout even a lengthy stay without needing to hunt around for charging outlets. With PowerStudio 300, camping is more free.Content Creators:The days of having to work from an office are long gone. In fact, nowadays you don't even have to work from home. With a laptop and a dependable power source you could work from a hilltop, a camper van, or a park bench.Content creators can power video equipment, lighting gear, microphones, drones, and much more, all from a stylish little box that weighs just 3.6kg/7.9 lb. It can provide you with 8 extra hours of drone flying, 12 more hours of phone video recording, 10 hours of professional lighting, or an extra 4 hours of continuous live streaming from a remote location.And it's not just internet creators that can benefit. Buskers and street artists can power amps, microphones, and instruments from a silent power source that can easily fit into a small bag. PowerStudio 300 sets your creative side free and allows you to go wherever your inspiration leads you.Music lovers, party animals and festival goers: Due to the events of 2020, crowded indoor venues have become a lot less common, and socializing and nightlife have become more intimate. Since clubs and bars can’t put on events, it’s up to you to organize your own.The portable power that PowerStudio 300 brings allows you to put on a memorable event for a close-knit group of friends in literally any environment.In addition to work, PowerStudio 300 is also great for play. Any tent at a music festival could do with a power source like this, both to make life more comfortable and to add to the fun. At outdoor parties you can power your own speakers or even a DJ deck, free from all the constraints of indoor venues.You could also add a dramatic light show or hook up a projector. The battery has enough capacity to power 100 songs from a speaker and 3 movies worth of footage from a projector, so there's no chance the party will be cut short.1 Single Charge = Backup for 1 YearThe PowerStudio 300 is well suited to playing the role of emergency backup as it holds its charge well in storage and is highly reliable. A single charge will give you backup for a year. For many parts of the world, natural disasters are a fact of life. An earthquake, typhoon/hurricane or other event could knock out a region's power supply for days. Having a modern, dependable backup power source gives enormous peace of mind. A power source like this can also help provide lifesaving medical care, for example keeping CPAP respirators running during blackouts or when far from medical facilities.Easy Carry For Children And EldersFor the true off the grid experience, you can connect solar panels to your PowerStudio 300 and charge the battery at up to 100W via the DC input. It's designed to be compatible with most portable solar panels on the market, and all you have to do is plug them in and the battery will start charging.This solution takes portability and freedom to the next level. Not only can you power your appliances far from civilization, but with solar charging you can do so indefinitely. The convenience and flexibility this brings goes without saying, and by using 100% renewable energy you're also doing your bit for the environment. The solar solution is great for those who like to get away from it all for long periods at a time, and it's also an infinite backup power source in the event of a prolonged outage.There's also something deeply satisfying about generating your own electricity. This solution is definitely recommended for those who love to be self-sufficient.With so much power available, obviously safety was a primary concern for our product team. The PowerStudio adheres to a number of international anti-flammable standards, and there are an extensive collection of failsafes that prevent overheating, overheating, short-circuiting when exposed to liquids, and much more. It has an extremely wide operating range of between 0°C and 40°C (32°F and 104°F), and will shut down safely when outside this temperate band.PowerStudio uses semiconductors from STMicroelectronics and integrates an effective dual-chip solution (using the STM32F030 series chip). Each of these two chips operates independently, one controlling the AC system and the other controlling the DC system.Ultra-efficient: The system response time is in milliseconds, which ensures stable power output.Precise power control: Most power products of this type have output discrepancies in the region of 10W, but through its highly effective dual-chip setup, PowerStudio 300 is able to limit this to under 3W, which is industry-leading accuracy.*STMicroelectronics is a French-Italian multinational electronics and semiconductor manufacturer headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. It is commonly called ST, and it is Europe's largest semiconductor chip maker based on revenue. Charge From 0 to 100% in Just 2.5 HoursOne of the downsides to very large batteries is that they can take a very long time to charge, but AUKEY has an innovative solution for this too. The PowerStudio 300 offers two methods of charging, one by DC input and the other via USB Power Delivery. Both of these methods are no slouch by themselves, with the tiny USB-C port supporting up to 100W and the DC input not much less, but for us that wasn't enough. Our engineers have successfully developed what we call Double Helix charging.This allows both of these input methods to be used simultaneously, greatly increasing the input power and vastly reducing the total time it takes to fill up the battery. Using this solution, the massive 297Wh lithium-ion battery can be charged from 0 to 100% in just 2.5 hours, which is several hours less than other products with similar capacities.Advanced Temperature ControlLarge batteries and high-powered charging tend to lead to one thing – heat. Just ask EV companies like Tesla, keeping everything cool is often the main constraint when developing products that use high-output battery technology. Luckily, the boffins at AUKEY have been able to come up with an ingenious solution that keeps temperatures down even at maximum output.We call this AeroZ, and it involves a dual-fan setup in combination with a sophisticated polymer air duct design. These two elements work in unison to achieve rapid heat dissipation, meaning your off-the-grid activities won't be cut short due to an overheating battery, even when out in direct sunlight. SOLAR PANEL SPECS

Beautifully designed, meticulously engineered and exceptionally flexible, the “Puna” is your perfect everyday carry tool. Not only does it look amazing, it is extremely tough, and will withstand years of use.What we do  Our mission, based in our London headquarters, is to design high-quality knives. Whilst small and discreet, our knives are incredibly useful around the studio. Our blades are sharp – surgically sharp – but when the blade does eventually go blunt, it can be replaced in just seconds. When folded, the “Crane” knife (at 52mm - 2.04"") is not much bigger than the blade itselfThe “Crane” was the first knife we made, and it proved so useful in our day-to-day lives, we never left home without it. We thought that its small size would mean it would only be used as an emergency back-up, but the more we used it, the more we realised its small size was its main strength – and it is now our ‘go to’ tool for all jobs requiring a sharp edge.What is the “Puna”?The Puna, tiny in size but big in features, is a multi-tool in disguise. It is perfect for cutting, twisting, prying, unscrewing or just fidgeting with! Press the safety button to remove the blade. Unlike other keychain tools, the Puna can be detached and is ready for use in just seconds. The tiny size and weight of the Puna makes cutting effortless.Once removed, the knife fits snugly in your hand. Its unique design pulls the blade securely under your finger, giving you unbelievable control. It really is the perfect precision cutting tool.Twist out the silencer to remove the micro screwdriver.Changing blades on a traditional scalpel is dangerous – if not impossible – without the correct tools. The Puna’s discretely hidden ‘micro screwdriver’ is a dedicated tool for maintaining the knife. Simply remove two screws and swap out the blades in a simple and safe way, without the need for any additional (and unnecessary) tools.This tiny screwdriver is also perfect for all your other small jobs – never have loose glasses again. The 3 Coil knife family, compared to a standard scalpel bladeAll our knives fold or unclip, which ensures they remain safe in your pocket, unlike the standard scalpel blade pictured above. These blades can be dangerous as they are always exposed, and there is no elegant way to carry it. 3 Coil knives, on the other hard, were created with safety and portability in mind.Also hiding in plain sight is a bottle opener. We’ll let you into a little secret here – this feature actually came about by accident. We noticed that the shape of the stock and grip made the perfect opener, and no multi-tool would be complete without an emergency beer opener!This aluminium case is the size of a business card, and even has working catches. Not only will it keep your product safe when we ship it to you, you can use the lid to store your credit & business cards . Just for you  To show our gratitude to you for supporting our products, we want to create something truly memorable. Your help should be rewarded, which is why for the first production run only, we will deliver your tool in a special aluminium presentation case.What’s included
