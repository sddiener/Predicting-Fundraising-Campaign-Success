Each character treads a complicated, morally ambiguous line, and the play can be approached in many different ways. One of the main features of this play is that it presents key questions and choices for each actor. Audiences are often curious about how the character of Shylock will be played—whether he’ll be a villain or a victim.  But, perhaps less famously, every actor in this play has to deal with these kinds of questions because every character in this play is written as a messy, complex person, full of dualities and contradictions. Each actor in rehearsals is doing a balancing act between different possibilities. And so the characters’ relationships are constantly shifting, making the nature of this particular production a constantly forming process.

An audience’s sympathies may shift back and forth between characters, and there are no moral and ethical certainties, but only continually shifting grey areas. And not just in the role of Shylock, but in all the characters in this play, we see Shakespeare’s recurring fascination with the complexity of humanity, and particularly our flaws and wrong choices. That’s part of what makes Shakespeare such a brilliant playwright, and why his works are so intriguing.</p><p> </p><p>Your backing of this show will help us to pay for our theater rental, rehearsal space, costumes, props, and set and ensure that we can continue to put on productions like this in the future.

In addition, you will be supporting a diverse artistic community in Seoul and allowing us to continue to create theatrical art in Korea’s international community.  </p><p><u><strong>An Introduction to Seoul Shakespeare Company</strong></u></p><p>Seoul Shakespeare Company is an all-volunteer theatre company that brings Shakespeare’s works to Seoul audiences in English, with Korean subtitles. We have existed since 2010, and have put on fully-staged productions since 2011. We typically produce one major show per year in Korea's theatre district of Daehangno, with smaller fundraising events throughout the year, as well as acting workshops that are open to the community.</p><p>We serve three main populations in Korea: </p><p>1) Korean audience members (including students) who would like to see Shakespeare performed in the original language, </p><p>2) English-speaking audience members (including students from international schools) who would like to see theatre performed in a language they understand </p><p>3) English-speakers (both foreign and Korean) who want to participate in making theatre and hone their craft in the theatrical arts. </p><p>By being an all-volunteer company, we are able to allow people of all nationalities to participate freely in the creation of theatre. At the same time, we aim to put on productions that are professional in quality, so that we are worth the time and effort of people who are serious about a future career in the theatre. Some of our past company members are now pursuing a professional career in theatre in other countries, and one of our core purposes is to provide an opportunity for English-speaking theatre people living in Korea to continue to develop their craft, while also contributing positively to Korean society.</p><p>Our recent productions of <i>The Winter’s Tale</i> and <i>Much Ado About Nothing </i>were very popular with audiences, defying expectations of what could be done in Seoul's theatre community, and have also marked the expansion of interest in our company among international schools in particular, bringing many groups of English-speaking students from these schools to attend our performances. For many in our audience (not just students), our shows are their first exposure to live theatre or to live Shakespeare performance in particular.</p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></strong></p><p>Even if you can't give directly to our production, you can help us by sharing our campaign through social media, and, if you're in Korea, coming to our show!  </p><p> </p><p><strong><u>Korean Bank Transfer Option</u></strong></p><p>If you have a Korean bank account, you can contribute via bank transfer.  Your contribution won't show up in our Indiegogo total, but we can still send you the perks listed above.  Send us an email to let us know that you've contributed, and whether you would like to receive the associated perks, and we'll add you to our list of donors.  Here is a link to our bank information: <a href=""https://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/make-a-contribution"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/make-a-...</a> </p><p> </p><p>Thank you for anything you are able to give to support this production!</p><p> </p><p><b>This year, for the first time, we are also seeking business sponsorships, exchanging ad space in our printed programs and social media for the support of (mostly local) businesses.

<h3>Trio De Femmes En Mexico</h3>
<p>We believe that engaging in intercultural dialogue through artistic collaboration and conversation initiates a process of healing and understanding, which in may in turn lead to authentic social and societal advancement.  We want to develop and refine this performance piece and this process, so that we are able to share it and connect with a wider international audience. </p>
<p>Trio de Femmes are committed to creating and holding space for the deeper conversations around our engendered experience and openly invite artists from a diverse range of cultural backgrounds to enter this space with us. We wish to expose and recognise our societal programming and go beyond these limited beliefs and perspectives. Ultimately we want to delve into the universal heart of the matter and create a rich, inclusive tapestry that celebrates everyone.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Trio De Femmes are asking for $3000 funding for this campaign. This is just under 50% of our total proposed budget for the Mexico project. This will go toward covering our expenses for flights, basic daily living costs in Mexico for the week, venue hire, technical support, documentation and most importantly paying the Mexican artists we are collaborating with. </p>
<ul>
<li>We are excited by the wide array of creative and personal perks and incentives we are offering you; arty postcards, cute personal handwritten letters, avant guard bespoke poetry, original artwork, singing tributes, mystery gifts and even a personal performance in your own home!</li>
<li> If by some strange twist of fate, we don't reach our entire goal, we will  carry on like troopers with the project. Coz we are Trio De Femmes and ain't nothin' gonna stop us!!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In Mexico we will gather information related to our themes exploring gender, feminism, cultural approaches to sex and sexuality and queer identity.  This exploration  will help develop the performance and complexify our artistic process. As three women co-creating universally relevant work based on our personal stories, we innately and explicitly encourage the work of women in general as well as of all people sensitive to investigating and expanding the local and universal feminine energy.  We are excited to be working intensely with the awesome team of Mexican collaborators led by <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Kabrieleart/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kabriele Rosas</a> and <a href=""https://alagrijma.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alejandro Guevara</a>.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Trio De Femmes have a direct style of communication that openly invites audiences to have a real experience of being seen, loved, accepted and not alone. We have had very meaningful post show conversations with audience members and our future planning includes workshops and discussions in conjunction with the performance.</p>
<p>Your support will go towards maximizing the success of this valuable and unique collaboration and furthering this convention breaking work. We sincerely appreciate you for your desire to support us.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are three hardworking women with many full time commitments. This is the first time we are setting up a crowdfunding campaign, and we know how much work they are from our friends and fellow artists that we ourselves have supported. We are aware that it will be a big challenge for us all to keep up the momentum required to advertise and share our project widely and to connect with those who might be excited by what we are attempting to do, and who would value what have to offer and feel awesome in supporting and the receiving the cool gifts on offer.</p>

I am the founder of DuDance, a non-profit organization that spreads the joy and power of dance through various projects (e.g. The Smile Experiment), events (e.g. Dance Therapy for Depression), and classes (e.g. teaching autistic children).We at DuDance LOVE dancing so much that we are driving across the USA connecting and making people smile by dancing with them.Wait, what? You’re doing what?Yes, you read that correctly: we are spreading smiles across the country through dance! From East to West, we will be stopping at dozens of locations and dancing with people to make them smile.That sounds silly. Have you ever done this before?Yes, and with great success in half a dozen cities! It’s called The Smile Experiment and from NYC to LA we’ve already made thousands of people smile physically and hundreds of thousands of people smile virtually. Okay, but why are you even doing this if you've already proven your experiment?More! More! We want more!But the evidence is already there! People will smile when you dance with them.Okay, you got us! Not only will we be filming The Smile Experiment, but we will also be capturing powerful stories of how dance has improved people’s lives. This will become an 8 part web series called Dance for Life.Hmm, whose lives?From Parkinson's and MS patients to children fighting cancer to people battling depression, there are people who are using dance not just as a game or hobby but as a life-saving medicine. You will help educate the world about how we can use dance as a tool to improve, and even save, lives!Now I am intrigued. What do you need from me?As you could have guessed, traveling across the country with a crew is not cheap. From travel expenses to hiring an Emmy award-winning crew to equipment rental, the expenses are pretty steep. And as much as we love making people smile through dance, I cannot do it alone. That is why I am asking you to share and contribute to our campaign to help us spread the joy and power of dance.Where is the money going?Maybe this will make things clearer:  Any extra money we raise and do not use towards the trip expenses will go towards post-production and towards producing even more Dance for Life episodes. There is a countless number of stories to tell! (And NO, I am not paying myself anything. Just my crew. I get paid in people's smiles when I dance with them. And in the people we influence to dance!)Okay, but what will I get if I contribute?Through The Smile Experiment and the Dance for Life series, you will help show thousands, if not millions, of people the JOY AND POWER OF DANCE! But for real, you will also get rewarded for your good karma. Check out the perks we are offering below. You can also see them to the right.If you are a dancer, dance coach, studio owner, dancetrepeneur, or just simply a dance lover, you cannot not miss this opportunity to back this project and get the country, and world, dancing more! We really hope you will contribute to our campaign and become a DuDancer*!*DuDancer - one who believes in the joy and power of dance and shares it PERKSPledge $10 - Become a DuDancer!Part of Thank You Video.

<p>As theatre artists, we have found a welcoming and warm home here at Bard College, and especially in the student-run theatrical space, The Old Gym. The annual Halloween show was the first piece we were involved in at Bard, and to be producing it now and carrying on this time honored tradition is a true thrill. We have amassed a company of passionate artists, all focused on creating a memorable, meaningful, and fun experience for the Bard community. We are driven and deeply motivated by our desire to produce the highest quality production as possible. This year, our student directors are devising adaptations of Hansel and Gretel, Snow White, The Little Mermaid, Little Red Riding Hood, Rumpelstiltskin, and Peter Pan and his Shadow. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently we are raising money to pay for the materials necessary to mount the production. The money we raise will enable us to buy the following:</p>
<p><strong>Curtains</strong> (necessary to build the individual rooms which the adaptations will take place in)</p>
<p><strong>Costumes</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Make-up.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Crucial building supplies (nails, tools, paint).</strong></p>

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>Meet Alpha Female, an artist baring her soul in a tumultuous ride of sex, booze, drugs and rock and roll and everything that comes with that chaotic journey toward self-reliance and self-integration.  She, her multiple personalities, and her band of hard-rockin’ misfits tell it like it is in this rough, raw soliloquy of sound while exploring contemporary issues like mental illness, substance abuse, compromise, exploitation, and the failed relationships along the way, ultimately seeking redemption of spirit through the power of music.   The show explores a number of issues, including mental issues, women's empowerment, the damage caused by abuse and stereotyping and the artist's struggle to conquer them all.</p>

<p>NYMF spends about $30,000 per show to provide a package of resources and services (which would cost much more for an individual, independent production). These resources include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Off-Broadway theater in which to perform your show, equipped with an extensive lighting and sound plot</li>
<li>A band package including keyboard or piano, drums, guitar and bass amps, music stands, chairs, etc.</li>
<li>Wireless microphones and instrument microphones, and all the perishable equipment needed to use them</li>
<li>A sound engineer (A1) to mix your show  and deck sound assistant (A2) to help with wireless microphones</li>
<li>Tape, gel, and other incidental tech needs, as well as a steamer or iron for wardrobe</li>
<li>A technician, production manager, box office management, and house management in each venue</li>
<li>Marketing assistance through the NYMF website, Festival-wide materials and advertising, Festival press/media outreach, and promotional events</li>
<li>Access to NYMF-specific discounts on rehearsal space, costumes, and other equipment, and on outside marketing and printing for your NYMF production </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We cover the rest.We currently have musicians who have done extensive work on Broadway and are excited to work on this project.  This initial $30,000 (a little more than half of our actual budget) will ensure we lock down a great General Manager who will take care of all financial dealings.  It will also help pay for our musicians' and actors' initial rehearsals -- transportation and compensation for their time as well as the remaining festival submission fee, due April 30th.  It will also cover legal fees,  promo shots, the cost of liability insurance and audition expenses (casting director for Equity auditions and studio rental.)  Our cast and crew are made up of professional people with loads of experience (see their bios on <a href=""http://www.badassbeautymusical.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.badassbeautymusical.com</a>) so that we can put on a professional level show in the largest musical festival in the world!   </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our show addresses issues of women's empowerment and the struggle of females everywhere.  Why do intelligent females put themselves down supporting everyone else but themselves?  Why are women discarded as we reach middle age due to ageism and discrimination?  How do women overcome the stereotypes that society has created about our roles in our chosen field?  How do we overcome these issues?  This show addresses these issues  set to fantastic, driving rock songs and a singer who blows the roof off the house!  The show is sexy, funny, bold and timely.  It is for mature audiences.</li>
<li>All of the people involved so far believe in this project.  I never expected to be selected and truly believe we will raise the money and reach our goals</li>
<li>I have specific goals.  All of the musicians involved and I have paid our dues and pounded the payment dreaming of earning our livings touring and making music.  My goal is to do just that -- tour the world with this musical while encouraging not only women, but folks of all ages along the way.  And of course, entertaining.</li>

Meet Alpha Female, an artist baring her soul in a tumultuous ride of sex, booze, drugs and rock and roll and everything that comes with that chaotic journey toward self-reliance and self-integration.  She, her multiple personalities, and her band of hard-rockin’ misfits tell it like it is in this rough, raw soliloquy of sound while exploring contemporary issues like mental illness, substance abuse, compromise, exploitation, and the failed relationships along the way, ultimately seeking redemption of spirit through the power of music.   The show explores a number of issues, including mental issues, women's empowerment, the damage caused by abuse and stereotyping and the artist's struggle to conquer them all.

Across the industry, there is a dearth of stories and decision makers from my background. I find this curious and saddening, yet it fuels me to be at the forefront of this change. <i>Gracie</i> is a play that champions the tenacity of the human spirit; I hope Gracie's story will empower girls, women and feminists who join us on her journey.</p><h3>About Our Project</h3><p>Gracie was born into a polygamous religious community, and brought across the US border to Canada at the age of eight. A lively and irrepressible child, her world is full of faith and family, but by the time she is fifteen, and at marriageable age, she feels increasing pressure to conform…but will she dare to take the leap and step into the outside world? A gripping and life-affirming story about growing up in a religious cult by Joan MacLeod, winner of Canada’s most prestigious literary award, the Governor General’s Award.This play is a work of fiction inspired by the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS) communities in Canada and the U.S.</p><p>It is important to us that we engage with the theme of violence against women and children presented within the play at a grass roots level. After performances we will be collecting donations for our partner charity <strong>Refuge</strong>, the country's largest provider of specialist services for women and children escaping domestic violence.</p><h3><strong>We Need Your Help</strong></h3><p>Performing theatre in London in an off west-end context can be costly and risky with many shows making a loss or only breaking even (just about!). We are excited to be bringing the European premiere of Gracie to the Finborough Theatre but this comes with its own risks and costs particularly as we are committed to paying our actor properly. We have an exceptional team of young creatives, all with brilliant careers ahead of them. Your support will not only make a difference to the success of this show but also their ability to create and perform work in the future.

<p>Native from France, I started bellydancing at age 17. After having explored, ballet, rythmic gymnastic and contemporary dance, I found my calling with the art of Middle Eastern dancing also called ""Danse Orientale"". I was part of the troupe ""Les Princesses de l'Orient"" in Nice directed by master teacher and choreographer Sandra, and then ""The Oriental Jewels"" directed by the amazing Talia in San Diego. I am now performing solo and have been teaching since 2005. I have more than 20 years of experience in Bellydancing. In addition, after a few years of practicing aerial hoop and silks, I discovered Pole Dancing and fell madly in love with it! I have been training hard at Emerald City Trapeze in Seattle and other studios, as well as my home, to be able to perform and for the last year I have been working on completing a teacher certification with Pole and Aerial.com.  I am also a 500h ERYTT Yoga Instructor with over 12 years of experience, and my classes will never miss to challenge you and bring you complete BLISS!</p>
<p>I now became the business owner of ""Dance Expression &amp; Yoga Flow""  and decided to open a Pole dance and fitness studio, (it will be so much better than doing this out of my home!) which will include also Bellydancing. I will have classes every day for beginners and all levels. Pole classes will include : Intro to pole, Spins, transitions and floorwork, climb and inversions, and pole fitness (for strength and flexibility). I will also be hosting workshops and teaching for Bachelorette parties. I bought 5 poles that had to be custom made because of the high height of the ceiling, I still need to buy crash pads, the insurance, cover the cost of advertising and the first couple of months of rent.  I did not get a bank loan, I am a single mom doing it all on my own with no financial support, and I had to use the last of my savings so far. My only plan is to make my studio very successful, and believing that it will all pay for itself in the end. Getting funds will be incredibly helpful in order to get everything the studio needs to make it successful and ready to get going!! </p>
<p>Grand opening is planned for January 2snd.</p>
<p>The main challenge of this project will be to not have enough students, that is why I would like to cover the cost of the rent rent of space for the first 2 months so I can have peace of mind and time to build up clientele.</p>
<p>Please spread the word, share this campaign, come to my class, first class will be free, experience the joy of dancing and the amazing workout and benefits (physical, emotional and mental) it provides!</p>

<h3>What is ""A Very Chris-terical Christmas Cabaret""?</h3>
<p>For many people in Toronto, this Christmas Cabaret has become an annual tradition; a tradition it has become harder each year to get tickets to before they sell out! This show has been thriving for the last 9 years at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre - the longest running and largest queer theatre in the world - and has been selling out for the past 5 years.  It feels like the right time, not only because it's the 10th anniversary, but also in light of all the dialogue these days about representation and visibility that this show should move to a bigger venue. This story deserves to be seen and heard by a much larger, broader audience.  If you contribute, you will be supporting a self-produced gay artist of colour enter mainstream visibility in Toronto from the periphery. </p>
<p>Also, the Christmas Cabaret needs a corresponding Christmas Album, so with you're help, we'll be recording that too. (an album you can have to keep in some form if you donate to this campaign at any level!)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$10,000 to cover the cost of recording ""A Very Chris-terical Christmas Album""</p>
<p>     - In-studio recording time (approx. $500/day for 4 days, not including musicians' fees)</p>
<p>     - Mixing (approx $3000)</p>
<p>    - Mastering (approx $1500)</p>
<p>    - Musicians' Fees (paying all the people on the album; approx. $150 per person per song)</p>
<p>    - Rehearsal time, and rehearsal space</p>
<p>$15,000 to rent a bigger theatre, ideally the CAA Theatre (formerly the Panasonic Theatre).</p>
<p>    - this is just the rental cost, and does not include: paying the performers, technicians,</p>
<p>       production costs, sets, costumes, etc.</p>
<p>What you get: In addition to the perks listed on the right, everyone who contributes to this campaign at any level will receive a ""thank you"" in the Christmas Cabaret's program / playbill, unless you wish to remain anonymous.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Cabaret is not a tried tested and true format for selling out big theatres, and so this is the type of show that would probably never find its way into the Mirvish's subscription season, but it is deserving of this kind of platform. Putting Chris Tsujiuchi and his band of merry musicians in a position to be seen and enjoyed by a much larger and broader group of people, in 2018 seems like the next logical step. (Not to mention that he'll finally be able to fulfill his lifelong dream of flying over the audience.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>A homegrown cabaret on this large of a scale is highly unprecedented in Canada. So no, it's never been done before.  But if there's one person who's going to make it happen, it's Chris Tsujiuchi.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to contributing to / sharing this crowdfunding campaign. Chris Tsujiuchi and his production team will be looking for corporate sponsors to cover the production costs, the cost of the band, the sets, costumes, lighting, staff at the theatre, etc. You can help by sharing this campaign, or if you know someone who works for, or runs/owns a company that would be interested in sponsoring this year's cabaret, please don't hesitate to send along their contact info, so we can set up a meeting, or send along an e-mailable sponsorship kit.</p>

These costs, on top of travel expenses to multiple weekly training sessions (locations sponsored by Hwarang Martial Arts and Tough Temple Crossfit), and the extra costs of staying on a healthy, fuel-filled diet to stay in shape for the event, has all been put towards one goal: Providing you with the best show possible, made up of the DC area's BEST gladiators available.
 
Anything we can profit on will also go towards the DC Stunt Coalition coffers - the publicity from this campaign, as well as your continued support and patronage, will help us to make bigger, better shows in the future. Not just for Spartacon, but for MAGFest, Otakon, AwesomeCon, and more. This year we were invited to ConBravo, OmegaCon, Otakon and A Video Game Con. We'd love to perform at all of these events, but without a source of crowd funds, we can't afford to do all of them! Help us take our show on the road. 
Funds from this campaign will also go towards producing OFFICIAL DC Stunt Coalition Gladiator T-shirts, tank tops, and photo cards (to be signed at SPARTACON), so that we can better promote our brand at the event, and allow for a more interactive connection with our fan base. We want to make you guys a part of the action! 
Your donations will allow us to spend time at the event meeting-and-greeting with you, the fans, by providing us with better accoutrements to our Ludus Suite.Even if we can't reach our entire goal, we'll be splitting what we raise between our production crew, as well as putting it towards providing the above mentioned perks to the fans. More than anything, we want YOU, the audience, to be a part of this show, whether that means wearing our colors with our bad ass, Spartacus: Blood and Sand inspired T-shirt, or by taking home a signed photo post card featuring our own gladiators in their incredible costumes.
Finally, should we receive all requested funding, we'll be recording the fights, and creating a post-convention documentary from interviews, footage, and a pilot episode of a webseries, ""Road to the Arena""
 
 
 

""Nothing in this world is impossible when heart and mind are put towards it!""
Fight shows like these give members of the Coalition an opportunity to sharpen their skills immensely with a specific goal over a short period of time. Training is intense, and requires a lot of sacrifices on the part of the performers and crew.
 

Over the course of this production, members have learned Sword and Shield, Single Sword, Filipino Martial Arts techniques, performed HIIT workouts, and a lot of Cross-Fit styled conditioning.  JB Jaeger of MD Jeet Kune Do has been helping us with specialized martial arts training for double-sword action for the last month, and has joined DCSC as a guest instructor. We even hosted a workshop with Jason Croom of FMA Action Club, an instructor from ACT TACTICAL For Film in Atlanta, Georgia. Training for a show like this not only strengthens the individual performers, but helps our group to bond as a team and motivate future productions. 
We have performed 5 live fight shows at conventions, including our massively successful, hour long show, The Legend of Zelda: Gamers Against the Grimdark at MAGFest 13. The audience of 1,400 fans gave us a standing ovation, and positive reviews and a demand for a new show have been a significant portion of the MAGFest official feedback form results. We've even been invited back to perform at MAGClassic as well as MAGFest 2016.
 
Our members train every weekend in the hopes that one day they'll be professional Hollywood stunt performers, theatrical stage combatants, or notable action actors. For many, this is just a first step towards achieving a career in the entertainment profession. Your support helps them to push themselves to the limit in the pursuit of this goal.
 



""A man must accept his fate, or be destroyed by it.""
 
Spartacon has offered us a starter budget to create many of the elements you'll see in the show - Costumes, weapons, and props.  But, as this is a first time convention, The Red Serpents cannot afford to hire our gladiators individually, or the crew to help run all the support necessary to create the production.
We have an experienced and dedicated crew working behind the scenes to make this show happen: 
 
Our costume designer, Rachel, has already put in over 100 hours of unpaid time to create 15 unique, genuine leather-and-rivet Gladiator costumes - including tributes to Spartacus, Crixus, and the Shadow of Death himself, Theokolese! Our in-house videographer Brett has shot over 10 hours of footage to document our training sessions. Our director  Dylan Hintz, on top of countless hours spent managing the production, organizing training sessions, and sacrificing other paid gigs to perform at Spartacon, has worked with Destroyer Modz to create custom weapons, shields, and props for the show. Tom Hyre, the director of the Panels Department at MAGFest, has also contributed his time and energy towards the production of the show's narrative and historical elements. 
 None of the above crew members have used the provided budget to fill their own purses with coin. Spartacon's Live Gladiator Stunt Show has been a passion project, but it's required a full summer of sacrifices for a show that will only run one time!We've been frugal, but to cloth and arm our fighters, we've exhausted the majority of our budget, and need your help to put on the finishing touches.
We have a cast made of professional stunt performers, martial arts teachers,  gymnastics instructors, experienced stage combatants and highly trained Shakespearean thespians.  For some, this is a first time endeavor, and a great learning experience. For others, this is the fourth, fifth or sixth live stunt show done by the DC Stunt Coalition, and they've earned the title of Champion.
 
 With this much experience and talent in one cast, we know we can make this an incredible show, we are just looking for whatever help you can give towards taking it over the edge!Unfortunately, as this is a fan convention, and not a traditional theatrical production, we aren't able to collect any profit from ticket sales. The only way for us to raise funds to pay our performers and crew is through your generosity.


Split heavens with the sound of our name!
We know not everyone can donate, and we only have a limited supply of perks to give out, but there's other ways you can help us become LEGENDS!
 
We want it to be known that we're going to all of this effort to put on a unique and enthralling experience for fans of Spartacus, 300, Gladiator, and live stunt shows everywhere. DC Stunt Coalition has a presence on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as our official website. Share our content, like and favorite our posts, and if you feel so inclined, tag, tweet and share it to the actors from the original television show like Liam McIntyre and Manu Bennett, so they know what kind of amazing tribute is being done towards their legacy. 
IndieGoGo also has plenty of Share tools for you to use! Click those!
Spartacon will be premiering in the DC area on August 15th, 2015. If you can show up, you can join the crowds and cheer us on, stop by our merchandise booth, say hi, and tell us how much you enjoyed the show. If you want us to come back again, witness our epic gladiator fights, and answer that age-old question:
""ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!""

<h2><b>In Toxic</b></h2>
<p>My name is Tara Hershberger. I am a playwright, director, actor, musician, and high school teacher. I am passionate about theatre, the accessibility of arts, social justice, protecting the environment, and transitioning to sustainable lifestyles. </p>
<p>This play began many years ago, based in the story of a family dealing with addiction and recovery. It had a workshop performance in April, 2015 with an amazing reception. The majority of the cast and crew have returned to work on this transformative play for a larger audience at Portland's Fertile Ground Festival, an 11-day arts festival that will be held January 21 through 31 in Portland, OR, which features the finest new
 work of local artists, performers and resident theatre companies. <a href=""http://fertilegroundpdx.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://fertilegroundpdx.org/</a><br/></p>
<p>In Toxic is important to those of us at World's Edge Players because of the power of it's message, the beauty of the language, and the creative energy collaboratively poured into it.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help us realize this production, fund our budget for logistics needs, and pay actors, and technicians for their skilled work.</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>Our goal is to raise $2,000. The vast majority of this money will go to actors, designers, stage managers, and the writer/director. $1,400 will be divided between 8 cast members, and 6 creative/crew members. These individuals will commit themselves to a month of rehearsal and design in service to their art. This money will guarantee a minimum stipend, in addition to a share of income from ticket sales. $200 will go to administrative costs, including registration fees and box office service. $400 will go to costs of purchasing/creating costumes, props, and set pieces. </p>
<p>Perks include a signed show poster, special guest treatment at the show, and dinner with any member of the cast and crew. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>At the heart of In Toxic is a story of love between sisters, and also of addiction, heartache, rejection, and redemption. It is set against the backdrop of a community and a wetlands being destroyed by transportation of coal and oil. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>An estimated 200 people experienced the workshop production. The play had a powerful impact on the audience, moving many to tears.

I am also putting together a phenomenal team to help direct, stage manage and design in order to ensure all aspects of the show are given the attention they deserve.
I understand that not everyone can give, but if you choose not to give, I ask that you please share this amongst your friends via social media, IndieGogo and all the rest: get this campaign out there and we can make this show happen!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Established in 2006 by a group of theatre professionals determined to create lively and original art for an audience that seeks to be challenged as well as entertained. In our tenth year producing theater in San Francisco we are thrilled to be collaborating with playwright Patricia Milton on a world premiere.

<p>Patricia Milton is an award-winning, internationally-produced playwright and a San Francisco native. Her plays uniquely blend the personal and the political.

<p>Single set.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Six years ago, Joanna’s daughter, Mercy, disappeared from her home. At last, a suspect, Richard Derek Cooper, has confessed and may stand trial for Mercy’s abduction and murder through circumstantial evidence, and his own admission, as her body was never recovered. Joanna is determined she and her other daughter, Bethany, will speak at the trial, to read victim’s statements about the emotional damage Cooper has caused the family. Joanna’s need for an open declaration of the harm committed, and to speak publicly of the impact of her daughter’s death, runs deep.</p>
<p>They reach an impasse when their family advocate arrives with a plea offer. As the three convene in Bethany’s home in Ukiah, California, Joanna is shocked to learn that Bethany is eager to accept a plea deal. Unlike her mother, Bethany wants to reject the possibility of the death penalty in favor of a lighter sentence for Cooper. Bethany is a psychologist whose work in the local jail has given her a first-hand look at the injustices of the system, and she is reluctant to condemn anyone … even the man who may have killed her sister. She also bears information about Mercy’s activities on the day of the murder that doesn’t line up with testimony given by Joanna herself.</p>
<p>As the realities of Mercy’s disappearance and its aftermath are examined, each woman defends her right to forgive or seek vengeance, and each claims justice is hers. The play looks at the concept of forgiveness in relationship to justice. When is forgiveness a cop-out? How is culpability determined when good intentions cause irreparable harm? What does the injustice of our justice system mean for victims and their families?</p>

Working Title: ""Without Mercy""
by Patricia Milton
2w. 1m.

Joanna, mother, teacher, 50's
Bethany, psychologist, 30's
Sam, their advocate attorney, flexible age

Single set.

Six years ago, Joanna’s daughter, Mercy, disappeared from her home. At last, a suspect, Richard Derek Cooper, has confessed and may stand trial for Mercy’s abduction and murder through circumstantial evidence, and his own admission, as her body was never recovered. Joanna is determined she and her other daughter, Bethany, will speak at the trial, to read victim’s statements about the emotional damage Cooper has caused the family. Joanna’s need for an open declaration of the harm committed, and to speak publicly of the impact of her daughter’s death, runs deep.
They reach an impasse when their family advocate arrives with a plea offer. As the three convene in Bethany’s home in Ukiah, California, Joanna is shocked to learn that Bethany is eager to accept a plea deal. Unlike her mother, Bethany wants to reject the possibility of the death penalty in favor of a lighter sentence for Cooper. Bethany is a psychologist whose work in the local jail has given her a first-hand look at the injustices of the system, and she is reluctant to condemn anyone … even the man who may have killed her sister. She also bears information about Mercy’s activities on the day of the murder that doesn’t line up with testimony given by Joanna herself.
As the realities of Mercy’s disappearance and its aftermath are examined, each woman defends her right to forgive or seek vengeance, and each claims justice is hers.

This play has been written to place a spotlight on the growing pressures on social workers and social care agencies, the growth of child poverty, and how the media approaches 'public interest' stories.  The play has been developed through research into past true-life cases and interviews with social workers.Over the last ten years the growth of social media has allowed us to connect across the world but has also led us to delve further and further into the personal lives of anyone who happens to fall under the spotlight.  Can you try and do good without bringing risk to yourself?  What really qualifies as public interest? 

Why we need you


Taking a show to Edinburgh is an expensive undertaking, but a huge opportunity. We will be fundraising through previews, as well as personally investing in the show.  However we are also hoping to secure investments, of every size, to help us cover these costs:

- Paying our actress and marketing team.
- Cover travel and accommodation for the company (actress, playwright, assistant and technician)
- Pay for marketing materials such as flyers, posters and brochure listings .

We are looking to raise £6,000 to support this show and give this important story a future life.  Our fundraising objectives mean that every penny of money made through ticket sales up at the fringe can then be reinvested into a London run and UK tour of this play.



How to donate


You can donate via this Indiegogo campaign where we have a range of fantastic rewards waiting for you for donations ranging from £10 to £500.


Become a Bruised Sky Angel


Every sky needs its angels and we’re looking for generous patrons to donate amounts of £1,000+.  Our angels will receive a credit as an Executive Producer in our marketing and online, signed copies of the playscript and poster and our everlasting gratitude, as well as being invited to attend a special performance with friends after the Fringe.

<h3>The Project </h3>
<p>Run by the Paris based company, <a href=""http://www.foolscaptheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fool's Cap Theatre</a>, directed by the Brazilian choreographer and performer, Vinicius Carvalho, the project <i>""Attachés"" (Attached)</i> started from a research on the expression of the body and on very basic elements of the physical movement. The aim is to create an 80 minutes performance, mixing dance, theatre, mime and going beyond our cultural borders.</p>
<p>The team is composed by five performers, one musician, a lighting designer, a costume maker, a video and photo artist and an administrative team, all coming from different artistic and cultural backgrounds, including France, Brazil, UK, Colombia and Italy. <br/>The piece will be performed in December 2019 in Paris and tour internationally in 2020/2021.<br/>For all that, we need your support!</p>

<p><i>""Attachés"" (Attached)</i> is the third project by the company, dealing with our necessity of being attached. Attached to the other, attached to our daily routines and habits, to our vices. Attached to objects, ideologies, memory, religion; attached to our families, countries and relationships. The fear of being alone or the uncomfortableness of having ""nothing to do"" generates in us the impulse to look around us and to relate to the world. This mechanism is not bad or good, it's part of our human condition. We often create our gods: god-marriage, god-money, god-work, god-alcohol, god-beliefs, god-phones...<br/>Although it is part of our human nature to ""need"" things and people, we know deeply down that, at some point, we can lose them all. Then we will have to find a way of living without them. In this moment, we start questioning the nature of our happiness and what we really need. Then, we may be able to work on the other side of the coin: the detachment of our needs.</p>

<h3><strong>The support we need: </strong></h3>
<p>We are due to perform the finished piece in this December 2019 at the Espace Beaujon, in Paris, France. We are 6 people on the stage (5 performers and one musician). We are looking for financial support to fully develop the piece and give it the quality it deserves. So we can give it back to the community. </p>
<p><strong>All funding</strong> collected in this platform will serve to pay the artists involved. We are searching for other funding opportunities and we are waiting for a couple of answers, from supporters such as the Ville de Paris and Spedidam.</p>
<p><strong>As an exchange</strong> you will be added to the priority list of the company, having your name on the programme of the show, on the website and social media pages of the company, getting free tickets to see shows and participate in workshops, as well as other special treats such as a meal with the team or following the process live.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support will contribute to the making of the show and to paying a fare fee to the artists. For us, it will be a present and an encouragement to keep doing what we do. For the community, it will be a way of sharing, meeting and celebrating live relationships.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Help us also getting the word out (loud), making some noise about our project. Sharing with your friends, family members and people you may think could be interested.</p>

<p>Porté par la compagnie parisienne, <a href=""http://www.foolscaptheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fool's Cap Theatre</a>, dirigé par le chorégraphe et interprète brésilien, Vinicius Carvalho, le projet <i>""Attachés""</i> est né d'une recherche sur l'expression du corps et sur des éléments fondamentaux du mouvement. L’objectif est de créer un spectacle de 80 minutes alliant danse, théâtre, mime et dépassant nos frontières culturelles.</p>
<p>L’équipe est composée de cinq interprètes, un musicien, un régisseur lumière, un costumier, un artiste vidéaste et une équipe administrative, tous issus de milieux artistiques et culturels différents (France, Brésil, Royaume-Uni, Colombie et Italie).<br/>La pièce sera jouée en décembre 2019 à Paris et fera une tournée internationale en 2020/2021.<br/>Malgré tout, nous avons besoin de votre soutien!</p>

L’attachement à l’autre, à une habitude, à un objet, à une mémoire, à une religion, à un amour. La peur d'être seul ou l'inconfort de ne ""rien faire"", génère en nous l'impulsion de regarder autour de nous et de nouer des relations avec le monde. Ce mécanisme n'est ni mauvais ni bon, cela fait partie de notre condition humaine. Nous créons souvent nos dieux: dieu-mariage, dieu-argent, dieu-travail, dieu-alcool, dieu-croyances, dieu-portable ...<br/>Bien que cela fasse partie de notre nature humaine de ""besoin"" des choses et des personnes, nous savons profondément que, à un moment donné, nous pouvons toutes les perdre. Ensuite, nous devrons trouver un moyen de vivre sans eux. En ce moment, nous commençons à nous interroger sur la nature de notre bonheur et sur ce dont nous avons vraiment besoin. Ensuite, nous pourrons peut-être travailler de l’autre côté de la médaille: le détachement de nos besoins.</span></p>

<h3>O Projeto</h3>
<p>Produzido pela companhia de dança-teatro, <strong><a href=""http://www.foolscaptheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fool's Cap Theatre</a>,</strong> sediada em Paris e dirigida pelo coreógrafo e performer brasileiro, Vinicius Carvalho, o <i>""Attachés"" (Apegados) </i>partiu de uma pesquisa sobre a expressão do corpo e sobre elementos de base do movimento. O objetivo é criar um espetáculo de 80 minutos, combinando dança, teatro, mímica e ultrapassando nossas fronteiras culturais.</p>
<p>A equipe é composta por cinco atores-bailarinos, um músico, um designer de luz, um figurinista, um videoartista e uma equipe administrativa. Todos são provenientes de diferentes origens artísticas e culturais, incluindo França, Brasil, Reino Unido, Colômbia e Itália.<br/>A peça será apresentada em dezembro de 2019 em Paris e fará turnê internacional em 2020/2021.<br/>Por tudo isso, precisamos do seu apoio!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>O espetáculo - </h3>

<p><strong><i>""Attachés""</i></strong> <i>(Apegados)</i> </p>
<p><i>""Attachés"" (Apegados)</i> é o terceiro projeto da companhia e trata da necessidade humana de apego. Apego ao outro, apego às nossas rotinas e hábitos, aos nossos vícios. Apego a objetos, ideologias, memória, religião; apego às nossas famílias, países e relacionamentos. O medo de ficar sozinho ou o desconforto de não ter ""nada para fazer"" gera em nós o impulso de olhar ao nosso redor e nos relacionar com o mundo. Esse mecanismo não é ruim ou bom, simplesmente faz parte da nossa condição humana. Frequentemente criamos nossos deuses: deus-casamento, deus-dinheiro, deus-trabalho, deus-álcool, deus-crenças, deus-celular...<br/>Embora seja parte de nossa natureza humana ""necessitar"" de coisas e pessoas, no fundo sabemos que, em algum momento, podemos perder tudo. Então teremos que encontrar um meio de viver sem nossos apegos. Neste momento, começamos a questionar a natureza da nossa felicidade e do que realmente precisamos. Então, podemos trabalhar do outro lado da moeda: o desapego de nossas necessidades.</p>

<p>Sulla scena cinque corpi s'incontrano per esplorare individualmente, in coppia, in trio e in gruppo il tema dell'attaccamento. L'attaccamento all'altro, a un'abitudine, ad un oggetto, alla memoria, alla religione , all'amore. Partendo da una ricerca coreografica sul movimento, Attachés si presenta come uno studio sul linguaggio, cercando un cammino possibile tra la danza e il teatro gestuale.</p>
<p><strong>Le nostre collaborazioni</strong>: Abbiamo già il sostegno di European Cultural Foundation; la fondazione Danish Arts Foundation; le Centre National de la Danse; La Briqueterie CDCN du Val de Marne ; La Ménagerie de Verre ; S'ALA (Igor &amp; Moreno); l'Odin Teatret Nordisk teaterlaboratorium; l'Espace Beaujon et le Collectif des Arts du Mime et du Geste (3e Biennale).</p>

The Project 
Run by the Paris based company, Fool's Cap Theatre, directed by the Brazilian choreographer and performer, Vinicius Carvalho, the project ""Attachés"" (Attached) started from a research on the expression of the body and on very basic elements of the physical movement. The aim is to create an 80 minutes performance, mixing dance, theatre, mime and going beyond our cultural borders.
The team is composed by five performers, one musician, a lighting designer, a costume maker, a video and photo artist and an administrative team, all coming from different artistic and cultural backgrounds, including France, Brazil, UK, Colombia and Italy. The piece will be performed in December 2019 in Paris and tour internationally in 2020/2021.For all that, we need your support!

The show

""Attachés"" (Attached) - piece (in progress)Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhHI-r7IlBM&t=7s
""Attachés"" (Attached) is the third project by the company, dealing with our necessity of being attached. Attached to the other, attached to our daily routines and habits, to our vices. Attached to objects, ideologies, memory, religion; attached to our families, countries and relationships. The fear of being alone or the uncomfortableness of having ""nothing to do"" generates in us the impulse to look around us and to relate to the world. This mechanism is not bad or good, it's part of our human condition. We often create our gods: god-marriage, god-money, god-work, god-alcohol, god-beliefs, god-phones...Although it is part of our human nature to ""need"" things and people, we know deeply down that, at some point, we can lose them all. Then we will have to find a way of living without them. In this moment, we start questioning the nature of our happiness and what we really need. Then, we may be able to work on the other side of the coin: the detachment of our needs.

The company
Fool's Cap Theatre
website: www.foolscaptheatre.com
Fool's Cap Theatre is an international performing arts company founded in 2015. Recently relocated from London to Paris, the company has presented its works throughout Europe, Brazil, India and Korea. We always engage a multicultural ensemble of artists because that's the way we like working, and how we believe we could create something richer. We combine creation and pedagogy based on devising, group work and movement.
A few reviews on the work are:
“A ballet of colourful life, playful and full of hope!“   (THEATRE ACTU - Festival Mimesis 2017)
""...Spellbinding"" (Reviews Gate)
""...a visual treat"" (The Times of India)
“Mesmerising, to say the least” (Telangana Today)
""...standing ovation and undying applauses from the audience"" (The Times of India)
Our partners: We have already gathered important partners such as the European Cultural Foundation; the Danish Arts Foundation; the Centre National de la Danse; La Briqueterie CDCN du Val de Marne, La Ménagerie de Verre; S'ALA (Igor & Moreno); Odin Teatret Nordisk teaterlaboratorium; Espace Beaujon and Collectif des Arts du Mime et du Geste (3e Biennale).

The support we need: 
We are due to perform the finished piece in this December 2019 at the Espace Beaujon, in Paris, France. We are 6 people on the stage (5 performers and one musician). We are looking for financial support to fully develop the piece and give it the quality it deserves. So we can give it back to the community. 
All funding collected in this platform will serve to pay the artists involved. We are searching for other funding opportunities and we are waiting for a couple of answers, from supporters such as the Ville de Paris and Spedidam.
As an exchange you will be added to the priority list of the company, having your name on the programme of the show, on the website and social media pages of the company, getting free tickets to see shows and participate in workshops, as well as other special treats such as a meal with the team or following the process live.
 

The Impact
Your support will contribute to the making of the show and to paying a fare fee to the artists. For us, it will be a present and an encouragement to keep doing what we do. For the community, it will be a way of sharing, meeting and celebrating live relationships.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Help us also getting the word out (loud), making some noise about our project. Sharing with your friends, family members and people you may think could be interested.
 
THANK YOU SO MUCH !

Le Projet
Porté par la compagnie parisienne, Fool's Cap Theatre, dirigé par le chorégraphe et interprète brésilien, Vinicius Carvalho, le projet ""Attachés"" est né d'une recherche sur l'expression du corps et sur des éléments fondamentaux du mouvement. L’objectif est de créer un spectacle de 80 minutes alliant danse, théâtre, mime et dépassant nos frontières culturelles.
L’équipe est composée de cinq interprètes, un musicien, un régisseur lumière, un costumier, un artiste vidéaste et une équipe administrative, tous issus de milieux artistiques et culturels différents (France, Brésil, Royaume-Uni, Colombie et Italie).La pièce sera jouée en décembre 2019 à Paris et fera une tournée internationale en 2020/2021.Malgré tout, nous avons besoin de votre soutien!
 
Le spectacle
""Attachés"" - pièce (en cours de création)Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhHI-r7IlBM&t=7s
Sur scène, cinq corps se rencontrent pour explorer individuellement, en couple, en trio, et en groupe, le thème de l’attachement. L’attachement à l’autre, à une habitude, à un objet, à une mémoire, à une religion, à un amour. La peur d'être seul ou l'inconfort de ne ""rien faire"", génère en nous l'impulsion de regarder autour de nous et de nouer des relations avec le monde. Ce mécanisme n'est ni mauvais ni bon, cela fait partie de notre condition humaine. Nous créons souvent nos dieux: dieu-mariage, dieu-argent, dieu-travail, dieu-alcool, dieu-croyances, dieu-portable ...Bien que cela fasse partie de notre nature humaine de ""besoin"" des choses et des personnes, nous savons profondément que, à un moment donné, nous pouvons toutes les perdre. Ensuite, nous devrons trouver un moyen de vivre sans eux. En ce moment, nous commençons à nous interroger sur la nature de notre bonheur et sur ce dont nous avons vraiment besoin. Ensuite, nous pourrons peut-être travailler de l’autre côté de la médaille: le détachement de nos besoins.
Calendrier provisionnel : * 25 fév au 2 mar 2019 : résidence au Centre National de la Danse à Paris (France)* 4 au 16 mar 2019 : résidence à La Briqueterie CDCN Val du Marne (France)* 26 aout au 14 sep 2019 : résidence au espace S'ALA (Cie.

O Projeto
Produzido pela companhia de dança-teatro, Fool's Cap Theatre, sediada em Paris e dirigida pelo coreógrafo e performer brasileiro, Vinicius Carvalho, o ""Attachés"" (Apegados) partiu de uma pesquisa sobre a expressão do corpo e sobre elementos de base do movimento. O objetivo é criar um espetáculo de 80 minutos, combinando dança, teatro, mímica e ultrapassando nossas fronteiras culturais.
A equipe é composta por cinco atores-bailarinos, um músico, um designer de luz, um figurinista, um videoartista e uma equipe administrativa. Todos são provenientes de diferentes origens artísticas e culturais, incluindo França, Brasil, Reino Unido, Colômbia e Itália.A peça será apresentada em dezembro de 2019 em Paris e fará turnê internacional em 2020/2021.Por tudo isso, precisamos do seu apoio!
 
O espetáculo -

""Attachés"" (Apegados) 
""Attachés"" (Apegados) é o terceiro projeto da companhia e trata da necessidade humana de apego. Apego ao outro, apego às nossas rotinas e hábitos, aos nossos vícios. Apego a objetos, ideologias, memória, religião; apego às nossas famílias, países e relacionamentos. O medo de ficar sozinho ou o desconforto de não ter ""nada para fazer"" gera em nós o impulso de olhar ao nosso redor e nos relacionar com o mundo. Esse mecanismo não é ruim ou bom, simplesmente faz parte da nossa condição humana. Frequentemente criamos nossos deuses: deus-casamento, deus-dinheiro, deus-trabalho, deus-álcool, deus-crenças, deus-celular...Embora seja parte de nossa natureza humana ""necessitar"" de coisas e pessoas, no fundo sabemos que, em algum momento, podemos perder tudo. Então teremos que encontrar um meio de viver sem nossos apegos. Neste momento, começamos a questionar a natureza da nossa felicidade e do que realmente precisamos. Então, podemos trabalhar do outro lado da moeda: o desapego de nossas necessidades.

(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhHI-r7IlBM&amp...)
Sulla scena cinque corpi s'incontrano per esplorare individualmente, in coppia, in trio e in gruppo il tema dell'attaccamento. L'attaccamento all'altro, a un'abitudine, ad un oggetto, alla memoria, alla religione , all'amore. Partendo da una ricerca coreografica sul movimento, Attachés si presenta come uno studio sul linguaggio, cercando un cammino possibile tra la danza e il teatro gestuale.
Le nostre collaborazioni: Abbiamo già il sostegno di European Cultural Foundation; la fondazione Danish Arts Foundation; le Centre National de la Danse; La Briqueterie CDCN du Val de Marne ; La Ménagerie de Verre ; S'ALA (Igor & Moreno); l'Odin Teatret Nordisk teaterlaboratorium; l'Espace Beaujon et le Collectif des Arts du Mime et du Geste (3e Biennale).

I soldi raccolti attraverso questa piattaforfa servirano a pagare gli artisi. Stiamo cercando altre fonti di finanziamento e aspettiamo delle risposte dal Comune di Parigi e dalla Spedidam.

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Good ladies, gentlefolk and filthy peasants I bring glad tidings of Game of Thrones: The Pantomime! After our smash hit sell out run in Norwich we need your help to take our show to the next level, beyond the wall, to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2020.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Quintuple L is a new theatre company formed by former UEA students as the result of a conversation at a drunken house party that went too far. After a successful run of our first show ‘Game of Thrones: The Pantomime’ in Norwich we want to take our fabulously funny and viciously violent pantomime to Edinburgh.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We also want to use the Edinburgh Fringe as a launching pad for our company to put on further shows in Norfolk and across the country, providing opportunities for young people in the Norwich area to get involved in exciting, original theatre.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Game of Thrones: The Pantomime</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Written by King Joffrey himself (with his recently executed ghostwriter Sam Went) Game of Thrones: The Pantomime tells the <strong>true</strong> story of the first season of the hit TV show untainted by Season 8. Or even Seasons 2 through 7.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Marvel as the gallant and handsome King Joffrey fights to secure his rightful throne! Aww as he woos the beautiful Lady Sansa Stark! Boo and hiss at the dastardly villainous schemes of Ned Stark! Shout “He’s behind you!” as Ned’s useless henchman, Littlefinger, sneaks up on our fair heroes! Ignore the liars who say the sexy Queen Cersei is just a hairy man in a dress!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Game of Thrones: The Pantomime is an original parody of the popular book series and TV show re-imagining the story as a traditional pantomime as told by King Joffrey Baratheon.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re looking for your help to raise £1000 to get our show to the 2020 Edinburgh Fringe Festival.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Instead of spending your donations on wine and women the majority of this money will be spent on our venue, which based on our research should cost us around £2000 for our two week run.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While our priority is our venue (because performing outside in Scotland sounds cold) we will also be using your generous donations to pay our fringe joining fee, create props and costumes and print posters and flyers to market our show. So, the more money we can raise the better our show will look.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any additional money we raise will be used to finance previous in Norfolk and London, we’ve budgeted these previews at £300 each.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We hope to recoup the majority of our budget in ticket sales at the fringe and then use that money for Quintupple L to put on more original shows around the Norfolk area. This means that by donating to Game of Thrones: The Pantomime your money could echo in laughter for years to come.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What You Get</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In supporting Game of Thrones: The Pantomime you will be helping to bring a fantastically funny original pantomime to the Edinburgh Fringe and provide a better ending to the franchise than Season 8 managed. But that’s not all!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to tickets to our show in Edinburgh or the preview of their choice our backers will have access to a variety of Game of Thrones: The Pantomime goodies like personalised thank yous from the character of your choice, signed copies of the script or even dinner with the cast!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please check out our perks to see what takes your fancy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>When producing anything related to Game of Thrones the biggest risk is that we’ll abandon the project early to go make a series of Star Wars movies that we’ll then abandon when Netflix drives a lorry full of money to our house.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But, assuming that doesn’t happen, there is the risk we won’t be able to secure a venue in Edinburgh. While we think this risk is small, if it does happen, we will still perform the show around Norwich and London while preparing for Edinburgh 2021.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There’s also the risk of cast or crew dropping out at the last minute, however we have experience of dealing with this having faced this issue with our original Norwich production. In this case after a call out on social media we were quickly able to recast and keep our show on schedule.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>“Hexentanz” in German means “witches’ dance,” and we bring the spellbinding, subversive power of the witch to our modern-day spin on classic vaudeville. Spearheaded by choreographer and burlesque performer Vexy Minx, the Cabaret fuses golden-era burlesque and belly dancing with cutting-edge neo-burlesque, song-and-dance production numbers, circus arts, and sideshow to create an immersive nightlife experience. Featuring an all-star cast of some of New York City’s finest nightlife entertainers, we bring vaudeville back to life with a modern, diverse, feminist twist.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>We are thrilled to bring the Hexentanz Cabaret to the Slipper Room for a third time, but we need your help. We have set a goal of $1000 to offset expenses before we debut our biggest, most magical show yet. With the help of our incredible and supportive community we know we can make it a reality. These funds will help us create unique costumes, props, and music, and in addition to securing rehearsal space for our production numbers. We want to bring you the full, live vaudeville experience you deserve so you are dancing in your seat!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>

Helping us cover these costs enables us to continue to combine the talents of our incredible variety community by ensuring compensation for all involved, high-quality music and costumes, rehearsal space and time, and the advertising to make our shows a success and continue to produce more in the future.</p>
</div><div>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Help Autumn Cravens and Helen Miller go to NYC and Edinburgh!</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>The Cause</i></h3>
<p><i>Hitler’s Tasters</i>, a contemporary play by Michelle Kholos-Brooks, just finished its successful NYC run in the fall of last year; however, a show with such a powerful message simply couldn’t stop there! The cast elected to bring the show to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the largest theatre festival in the world. With the go-ahead from New Light Theatre Project in New York City, the cast managed to raise enough money to go and experience this amazing festival. Under the direction of Sarah Norris, the play is being condensed to a one hour version of its New York run. Because Ashlee Wasmund, the choreographer for the show, is a professor at Western Carolina University, we were able to audition for an amazing opportunity: the chance to be a part of this journey!</p>
<p>We will be switching off as a 5th character role in <i>Hitler’s Tasters</i> and will each understudy two of the four lead roles. This is an incredible opportunity to experience theatre on a global scale, develop an understanding of our profession in an international context, and build a network that will hopefully last us a lifetime. However, a chance like this doesn’t come cheap. We need as much help as we can get to reach our goal! We’ve outlined our expenses below and will be updating them as our goals progress and milestones are reached.</p>

<p>We have already accomplished so much within the community and need your help to present these important stories to the public! Our campaign will support a culminating performance that brings these voices to life with professional dancers and musicians at Speyer Hall, University Settlement October 25th-28th. </p>
<h2>People Involved</h2>
<p>Creative Traffic Flow (DawN Crandell, Jeesun Choi and Kristin Rose Kelly) is a theatre collective that creates ensemble driven performances that are socially just, equitable and inspire civil discourse. Formed at the inaugural National Institute for Directing and Ensemble Creation hosted by Pangea World Theater and Art2Action, CTF strives to present and perform at the highest level of artistic integrity while honoring multiple forms of expressions and perspectives.</p>
<p>We have selected six community performers, drawn from various University Settlement programs. We have participants from EXCEL Program, which serves young adults with special needs as well as new immigrants from Adult Literacy Zone, seniors from the 189 Allen neighborhood center and queer youth of color from The Door.</p>
<p>‘Duets of Difference’ will give the performers from The Door the opportunity to push their budding talents and interests in vogueing, modeling, and acting. Seniors at the 189 Allen neighborhood center have knowledge and wisdom to share and have more free time to interact socially and keep their minds and bodies active. The Excel students with special needs have been working all year with DawN Crandell in performance and dance and are excited to explore the form through their own stories.</p>
<p>This is an exceptional collision of experiences and passions. </p>
<p>We are looking to create a performance that grows from the community performers’ life stories, personal values and community beliefs. The community stories will be accompanied by professional dancers and musicians.</p>
<h2>Progress So Far</h2>
<p>Since February 2018, we have had the pleasure of leading introductory workshops for the Adult Literacy and Excel Program. We had an overwhelmingly positive response from these sessions and have recruited committed community participants, who want to continue their work with us.</p>
<p>On May 29, 2018, we shared a mini performance of ‘Duets of Difference’ at the University Settlement’s City Stories Gala with two community performers from the Adult Literacy Program. They were excited to practice English in a supportive environment and in front of an audience, as well as to meet new people.</p>
<p>Beginning July 2018, we started having weekly ‘Duets of Difference’ rehearsals at The Door. We are in the process of ensemble building and creating the performance.</p>
<h2>About University Settlement</h2>
<p>More than 130 years ago, University Settlement launched an innovative movement that changed New York City and the country. With University Settlement leading, settlement houses established the idea that immigrants and low-income families deserve basic services like quality education, decent housing, access to open space for exercise and health, and support for the aging. They proved that with a little help, these families could get a foothold on the American dream.</p>
<p>Right now, University Settlement serves many different Lower East Side community members including but not limited to homeless and LGBTQ youth at The Door, English Language Learners in the Adult Literacy Program, Elderly at 189 Allen neighborhood center, and youth with special needs through the Excel Program.</p>
<p>Thank you for all your support! Please consider making a donation to our project to support civil discourse through theatre and dance!</p>

<p>Compensate the leading artists, community performers, professional dancer and musician for the eight-week rehearsal and four public performances</p>
<p>Equally pay all artists and community performers involved.</p>
<p>As a collective, we believe in honoring artists’ time and commitment to a project. Each community performer, professional dancer and musician must dedicate rehearsal and performance hours to make this new work come to life. This requires adjusting work schedules, finding child care, and lengthening commutes. As a theatre collective we believe in pay equity for everyone we work with.</p>
<p>Our current goal of $5,000 is minimally budgeted as follows:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Dalia Carella, international dance artist/artistic director of the Dalia Carella Dance Collective is excited to collaborate with stylist/designer/dancer Debbie Cartsos (D.Webb Designs) on an interactive and immersive dance production.  Ms. Carella's work transcends labels and genres as it explores themes of spirituality and mysticism, feminism, global diversity, and her dark and sultry cabaret stylings.  DCDC's collaboration with Mrs. Cartsos, whose extensive design and styling artistry provides a sophisticated urban direction to the program, will bring human fashion installations to life, merging the worlds of couture and dance while contributing to the artistic direction for the photography and videography for the production. Special thanks to New York City Photographer Monzeeki Photography for her amazing eye and helping us create the look for the show!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our total expenses for the show are $18,000.  We are asking for $5,000 on Indiegogo to help offset some of the expenses towards costumes, theater rental and rehearsals.  We have raised over $2,000 and plan to fundraise through events, workshops and in-kind contributions this fall, but to realize our goals, we need your help as well.  In the past, DCDC has had four successful Kickstarter Campaigns, where we met our goals.  We are hoping for the same with Indiegogo!</li>
<li>If you donate to us during this campaign, you can earn some amazing perks.  Depending on how much you donate, our perks include shout outs, t-shirts, tote bags, beautiful note cards from DCDC's show ""Cabaret de la Nuit"", $100 gift certificate from D.Webb Designs, an Intuitive Tarot Reading by Dalia Carella, 2 Gala Tickets to Menagerie d'Arte and co-producer shout outs every night of the show! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are so thrilled to be putting on a high-quality show at Teatro LATEA, a professional theater in downtown NYC.  This space will allow the Collective’s work to be professionally lit, incorporate intricate set design, and serve as a platform to film work samples for future production and touring opportunities.  Our goal is to tour this show in the US and abroad in 2019, inviting both domestic and international performers to participate.  Therefore, the better the original production the greater the chances the show will hit the road!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge of a small non-profit dance company is lack of funding.  Many deserving and special projects struggle to take off simply because there isn't enough money to fulfill the artistic vision.  In our case, even if our project is fully funded, we may still need to offset unexpected costs/difficulties by scaling down some of the artistic elements of our production.  This might mean choosing simpler (cheaper) costumes, lighting design or set design.  It might mean opting for a smaller press &amp; social media campaign, which would ultimately limit our exposure and viewership.  It might even mean rehearsing fewer hours to save money when we’d rather take our time to develop the work.  These are the tough choices that we may have to make as we swing into the final phase of production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute to this campaign, here's how you can help.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about our Indiegogo campaign and use the Indigogo share tools to tell them where to go and donate.  Also give us a shout out on your social media pages and follow our Instagram page: menagerie_d_arte</li>
<li>Come to our show on November 30 - December 2, 2018.  Go to <a href=""http://www.daliacarella.com/menagerie-darte/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.daliacarella.com/menagerie-darte/</a> to purchase tickets.</li>

Dalia Carella, international dance artist/artistic director of the Dalia Carella Dance Collective is excited to collaborate with stylist/designer/dancer Debbie Cartsos (D.Webb Designs) on an interactive and immersive dance production.  Ms. Carella's work transcends labels and genres as it explores themes of spirituality and mysticism, feminism, global diversity, and her dark and sultry cabaret stylings.  DCDC's collaboration with Mrs. Cartsos, whose extensive design and styling artistry provides a sophisticated urban direction to the program, will bring human fashion installations to life, merging the worlds of couture and dance while contributing to the artistic direction for the photography and videography for the production. Special thanks to New York City Photographer Monzeeki Photography for her amazing eye and helping us create the look for the show!

What We Need & What You Get

Our total expenses for the show are $18,000.  We are asking for $5,000 on Indiegogo to help offset some of the expenses towards costumes, theater rental and rehearsals.  We have raised over $2,000 and plan to fundraise through events, workshops and in-kind contributions this fall, but to realize our goals, we need your help as well.  In the past, DCDC has had four successful Kickstarter Campaigns, where we met our goals.  We are hoping for the same with Indiegogo!
If you donate to us during this campaign, you can earn some amazing perks.  Depending on how much you donate, our perks include shout outs, t-shirts, tote bags, beautiful note cards from DCDC's show ""Cabaret de la Nuit"", $100 gift certificate from D.Webb Designs, an Intuitive Tarot Reading by Dalia Carella, 2 Gala Tickets to Menagerie d'Arte and co-producer shout outs every night of the show! 


The Impact
We are so thrilled to be putting on a high-quality show at Teatro LATEA, a professional theater in downtown NYC.  This space will allow the Collective’s work to be professionally lit, incorporate intricate set design, and serve as a platform to film work samples for future production and touring opportunities.  Our goal is to tour this show in the US and abroad in 2019, inviting both domestic and international performers to participate.  Therefore, the better the original production the greater the chances the show will hit the road!

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge of a small non-profit dance company is lack of funding.  Many deserving and special projects struggle to take off simply because there isn't enough money to fulfill the artistic vision.  In our case, even if our project is fully funded, we may still need to offset unexpected costs/difficulties by scaling down some of the artistic elements of our production.  This might mean choosing simpler (cheaper) costumes, lighting design or set design.  It might mean opting for a smaller press & social media campaign, which would ultimately limit our exposure and viewership.  It might even mean rehearsing fewer hours to save money when we’d rather take our time to develop the work.  These are the tough choices that we may have to make as we swing into the final phase of production.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute to this campaign, here's how you can help.

Get the word out and make some noise about our Indiegogo campaign and use the Indigogo share tools to tell them where to go and donate.  Also give us a shout out on your social media pages and follow our Instagram page: menagerie_d_arte

<h2>We’re gearing up for a big renovation to our lobby and we need your help!</h2>
<p>The Seacoast Rep has come a long way in the past four years. We’ve settled more than $400,000 worth of debts, repaired relationships in the community, installed a brand new HVAC system that keeps our theatre comfortable and allows us to produce year round, we’ve expanded our programming, not only in number of performances, but in the quality of our productions. We’ve created a new Senior Repertory company that is thriving, re-vamped our Red Light series, and restructured our Portsmouth Academy of Performing Arts and now we’re teaching more students than ever before. We’ve grown our sales, our staff, and our budgets, all while paying down debt.</p> <p>In the past four years we’ve thought a lot about what community means and how important it is to our theater and the role that theater plays in the community. Our community is built right into our mission. During these past four  years we’ve donated over $200,000 worth of tickets for use in local fundraisers and over $100,000 worth of tickets to our community partners such as Amy’s Treat, Krempels Center, The Chase Home, Haven, Cross Roads House, and more - bringing theatre into the lives of those who otherwise might have trouble experiencing it.</p>
<p>During these past four years we’ve employed hundreds of independent contractors, both locally and from around the country. We’re proud to have provided such a great experience that many of them have relocated to the area to work with us. We’ve been lucky to learn from many other great arts organizations in the Seacoast, while mentoring aspiring technicians, designers, and performers.</p>
<p>We consider ourselves a safe and welcoming organization where we strive to set standards in the entertainment industry and upholding those standards, as difficult as that may be at times.</p>
<p>We have more dreams, more goals, and so much more work to do. This doesn’t daunt us. It excites us. Some of these dreams and goals can wait as we prioritize our needs. Some needs, however, can’t wait.</p>
<p>We often get feedback along the lines of <i>“You always seem to be fundraising. It’s a lot.</i>” Believe us, we get it. We are. But the fact of the matter is, our team inherited hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt and decades of building maintenance that had, quite frankly, been put off. As much as we’d like to transition out of this sort of fundraising, we aren’t at that point quite yet. Every year we make progress and check things off of our to-do list. We’re now just a few years away from being debt free. We have about $200,000 more to go, and we’re trying our best not to incur any new debts.</p>
<p>We’ve already tackled some serious building issues such as rebuilding three flights of concrete and steel staircases, adding railings, adding emergency lighting, identifying and fixing a major leak in our women’s bathroom, and dealing with so many more tiny and mundane but important details.<i><strong> But the work isn’t done yet. </strong></i>The rest of the work that needs to be done at the theatre, as per the fire departments mandates, needs to be completed this year.</p> <h3><strong>Here is where we are at:</strong></h3>
<p>We need to have a sprinkler system installed in our lobby. Working with the city, we had set a deadline of December 1st, 2018. However, as our engineers started to dig in, they discovered all sorts of obstacles - as one does with old buildings and old city plumbing. In short, they found that the deadline given, and the the initial estimate would not be feasible - the water pressure just isn’t enough to power all of the sprinkler heads we need to cover the space.</p>
<p>The sprinkler company we are working with, in conjunction with John Destefano from DeStefano &amp; Associates, thoroughly researched all options to bring a sprinkler system in the lobby that would meet code. The least expensive option happens to be the best option for our neighbors as well, as it will not involve tearing up Bow st and wreaking havoc on that part of town. This option includes installing a suspended ceiling in our lobby. We know it sounds strange, but reducing the vertical square footage in our lobby allows us to install fewer sprinkler heads, which addresses a water pressure challenge we were facing before. That means we don’t have to pay the City to tear up Bow Street to install larger pipes.</p>
<p>We had a team of seasoned professional exploring every single option, and this one was determined to be the best one. It still gets quite complicated as in order to install a suspended ceiling: our leaky roof needs to be addressed, we will have to deal with heating and cooling issues in the lobby, we will have to build walls in the open walkway up above for our neighbors, and so on.</p> <p><strong>In order to meet all fire code mandates, we will need to raise a minimum of $180,000.</strong> This also includes the small portion of remaining work that must be done in the theater itself. We’ve been given a final deadline, which means we start work on this in May and we end the work in late summer. Thanks to our experts - we can do this without missing a single show or rehearsal.</p>
<p>This sounds like a lot - and it is. We’ve decided to take this as an opportunity to make long overdue improvements to our lobby. And now we’re actually all excited about providing you with a lobby experience that matches the quality of the productions you see on our stage every night. Let’s be honest, our lobby has been a point of embarrassment. We’re not particularly proud to have buckets out in our lobby every time it rains, or walls of ice on the inside of our walls every time it gets cold outside.  </p>
<p>When people have been hearing $180,000, after the sticker shock shock, they ask <i>“can you raise this amount in such short a time?</i>”<strong> Our answer is that we can because have no other choice. </strong>We have to raise these funds by the deadline or we will have to halt programming until we can. That is not an option for us, so we will get this done, one way or another, even if it means incurring more debt. We don’t want to do this, but we will if we have to.</p>
<p>We will be raising funds through multiple sources - grants, individual donations, and sponsorships. We already have raised quite a bit towards our goal.</p>
<p>Making a donation to this campaign is not only supporting our safety benchmarks, but<strong> it’s an investment in our future, as money we put into building improvements come off of the purchase price for the space at the end of our 10 year lease.</strong> We are a in the third year of our lease.</p>
<p>This $180,000 project doesn’t improve the cosmetics of the space by much. It is a minimum price tag. We’d love to avoid having a boring white suspended ceiling, so we’ve worked closely with DeStefano &amp; Associates, Bob &amp; Sue Thoresen, and Manypenny | Murphy Architecture to price out some aesthetic options. We’ve come up with a plan for some stretch goals once the initial funds are raised.</p>
<h3><strong>Stretch Goal One - Raise $280,000</strong></h3>
<p>With this stretch goal we would be able to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-do our bathrooms with improved ventilation in the men’s room, new stalls, new floors, new fixtures, new ceilings. They’ll look beautiful but they’ll also have more sustainable elements in them like hand blowers to reduce the need for paper towels. We’ll try to make them more ADA friendly where possible. We’ll be proud of how they’ll look and you’ll feel better in them.</li>
<li>Install new flooring. Alyssa from Manypenny |  Murphy and Bob Thoresen have been lending us their keen eyes to pick out some commercial grade flooring that will look good, be easy to clean, and it will all be level. We’re kind of really excited about this one. No more gray carpet and faux wood flooring!</li>
<li>Remove the glass walling in the lobby back and sides, insulate it, and restore it as a functioning art gallery once again.</li>
<li>Install a more attractive suspended ceiling that can tie in a theme of a room while highlighting certain areas such as the bar and box office. There are sleek modern designs that we’d love to incorporate elevating the look, feel, and experience of our lobby.</li>
<li>Make improvements to the bar, such as extending it to provide more seating options for our patrons. We’d also work on providing actual shelving and storage area for Mark behind the bar as well, making the area look like a bar that could rival others in town.</li>
</ul> <h3><strong>Stretch Goal Two - $350,000</strong></h3>
<p>With this stretch goal we would be able to do all of the above with the following additions:</p>
<ul><li>We would be able to expand the footprint of our bathrooms by moving our box office to a different location. Designs have shown we can add two more toilets to each restroom. <strong>Did you hear that ladies? TWO MORE TOILETS</strong>. That means less time waiting in line during intermission. We’ve been listening to your feedback.</li></ul>
<h3>We are excited to launch this fundraiser with a very generous matching donation of $25,000 from one anonymous donor and another $10,000 matching donation from another anonymous donor.</h3> <h3><strong>Here is how you can help:</strong></h3>

</div></div>","We’re gearing up for a big renovation to our lobby and we need your help!
The Seacoast Rep has come a long way in the past four years. We’ve settled more than $400,000 worth of debts, repaired relationships in the community, installed a brand new HVAC system that keeps our theatre comfortable and allows us to produce year round, we’ve expanded our programming, not only in number of performances, but in the quality of our productions. We’ve created a new Senior Repertory company that is thriving, re-vamped our Red Light series, and restructured our Portsmouth Academy of Performing Arts and now we’re teaching more students than ever before. We’ve grown our sales, our staff, and our budgets, all while paying down debt. In the past four years we’ve thought a lot about what community means and how important it is to our theater and the role that theater plays in the community. Our community is built right into our mission. During these past four  years we’ve donated over $200,000 worth of tickets for use in local fundraisers and over $100,000 worth of tickets to our community partners such as Amy’s Treat, Krempels Center, The Chase Home, Haven, Cross Roads House, and more - bringing theatre into the lives of those who otherwise might have trouble experiencing it.
During these past four years we’ve employed hundreds of independent contractors, both locally and from around the country. We’re proud to have provided such a great experience that many of them have relocated to the area to work with us. We’ve been lucky to learn from many other great arts organizations in the Seacoast, while mentoring aspiring technicians, designers, and performers.
We consider ourselves a safe and welcoming organization where we strive to set standards in the entertainment industry and upholding those standards, as difficult as that may be at times.
We have more dreams, more goals, and so much more work to do. This doesn’t daunt us. It excites us. Some of these dreams and goals can wait as we prioritize our needs. Some needs, however, can’t wait.
We often get feedback along the lines of “You always seem to be fundraising. It’s a lot.” Believe us, we get it. We are. But the fact of the matter is, our team inherited hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt and decades of building maintenance that had, quite frankly, been put off. As much as we’d like to transition out of this sort of fundraising, we aren’t at that point quite yet. Every year we make progress and check things off of our to-do list. We’re now just a few years away from being debt free. We have about $200,000 more to go, and we’re trying our best not to incur any new debts.
We’ve already tackled some serious building issues such as rebuilding three flights of concrete and steel staircases, adding railings, adding emergency lighting, identifying and fixing a major leak in our women’s bathroom, and dealing with so many more tiny and mundane but important details. But the work isn’t done yet. The rest of the work that needs to be done at the theatre, as per the fire departments mandates, needs to be completed this year. Here is where we are at:
We need to have a sprinkler system installed in our lobby. Working with the city, we had set a deadline of December 1st, 2018. However, as our engineers started to dig in, they discovered all sorts of obstacles - as one does with old buildings and old city plumbing. In short, they found that the deadline given, and the the initial estimate would not be feasible - the water pressure just isn’t enough to power all of the sprinkler heads we need to cover the space.
The sprinkler company we are working with, in conjunction with John Destefano from DeStefano & Associates, thoroughly researched all options to bring a sprinkler system in the lobby that would meet code. The least expensive option happens to be the best option for our neighbors as well, as it will not involve tearing up Bow st and wreaking havoc on that part of town. This option includes installing a suspended ceiling in our lobby. We know it sounds strange, but reducing the vertical square footage in our lobby allows us to install fewer sprinkler heads, which addresses a water pressure challenge we were facing before. That means we don’t have to pay the City to tear up Bow Street to install larger pipes.
We had a team of seasoned professional exploring every single option, and this one was determined to be the best one. It still gets quite complicated as in order to install a suspended ceiling: our leaky roof needs to be addressed, we will have to deal with heating and cooling issues in the lobby, we will have to build walls in the open walkway up above for our neighbors, and so on. In order to meet all fire code mandates, we will need to raise a minimum of $180,000. This also includes the small portion of remaining work that must be done in the theater itself. We’ve been given a final deadline, which means we start work on this in May and we end the work in late summer. Thanks to our experts - we can do this without missing a single show or rehearsal.
This sounds like a lot - and it is. We’ve decided to take this as an opportunity to make long overdue improvements to our lobby. And now we’re actually all excited about providing you with a lobby experience that matches the quality of the productions you see on our stage every night. Let’s be honest, our lobby has been a point of embarrassment. We’re not particularly proud to have buckets out in our lobby every time it rains, or walls of ice on the inside of our walls every time it gets cold outside.  
When people have been hearing $180,000, after the sticker shock shock, they ask “can you raise this amount in such short a time?” Our answer is that we can because have no other choice. We have to raise these funds by the deadline or we will have to halt programming until we can. That is not an option for us, so we will get this done, one way or another, even if it means incurring more debt. We don’t want to do this, but we will if we have to.
We will be raising funds through multiple sources - grants, individual donations, and sponsorships. We already have raised quite a bit towards our goal.
Making a donation to this campaign is not only supporting our safety benchmarks, but it’s an investment in our future, as money we put into building improvements come off of the purchase price for the space at the end of our 10 year lease. We are a in the third year of our lease.
This $180,000 project doesn’t improve the cosmetics of the space by much. It is a minimum price tag. We’d love to avoid having a boring white suspended ceiling, so we’ve worked closely with DeStefano & Associates, Bob & Sue Thoresen, and Manypenny | Murphy Architecture to price out some aesthetic options. We’ve come up with a plan for some stretch goals once the initial funds are raised.
Stretch Goal One - Raise $280,000
With this stretch goal we would be able to do the following:

Re-do our bathrooms with improved ventilation in the men’s room, new stalls, new floors, new fixtures, new ceilings. They’ll look beautiful but they’ll also have more sustainable elements in them like hand blowers to reduce the need for paper towels. We’ll try to make them more ADA friendly where possible. We’ll be proud of how they’ll look and you’ll feel better in them.

We’re kind of really excited about this one. No more gray carpet and faux wood flooring!
Remove the glass walling in the lobby back and sides, insulate it, and restore it as a functioning art gallery once again.
Install a more attractive suspended ceiling that can tie in a theme of a room while highlighting certain areas such as the bar and box office. There are sleek modern designs that we’d love to incorporate elevating the look, feel, and experience of our lobby.
Make improvements to the bar, such as extending it to provide more seating options for our patrons. We’d also work on providing actual shelving and storage area for Mark behind the bar as well, making the area look like a bar that could rival others in town.
 Stretch Goal Two - $350,000
With this stretch goal we would be able to do all of the above with the following additions:

<p><i>Workshop performance at Rockwall Studios, Brooklyn. September 2017.</i></p>
<h3><strong><i>Solarplexus</i>? I thought that was the third chakra of power and wisdom?</strong></h3>
<p>You're right. It is. But it's also a sci-fi comedy about the apocalypse, environmentalism, and corporate greed.</p>
<p>With a climate-change apocalypse approaching, Ellen and her corporatized brother seek refuge on their father's sustainable, eco-friendly commune. His plan to save the world? A gender-fluid, pedal-powered bicycle named Mercury Daniels. But you'd better hope they can set aside their differences before the CEO of that mega tech corporation, <a href=""https://solarplexusplay.com/syzygy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Syzygy</a>, gets his hands on them. Will the family overcome their clashing beliefs and save the world with the forces of renewable energy?</p>
<p><strong>Outside of the world of the play</strong>, Solarplexus is committed to the values of its script through action. One year ago, when we staged the first production of the play at <a href=""http://rockwallstudios.nyc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Rockwall Studios</a> in Brooklyn, we partnered with <a href=""http://andrefeliciano.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">André Feliciano</a> to build a pedal-powered bicycle as a set piece, able to convert mechanical energy (pedaling) into electrical energy (the show’s lighting), and simultaneously function as a central part of the story’s plot. The bicycle stored energy as well, and <strong>we are proud to have successfully powered all of the production’s lights through our pedal-powered bicycle, Mercury. </strong>We also used solar power and only LED bulbs in lighting the show.</p>
<p>As a group of artists, we believe in the intersection between art and the environment, between storytelling and science, and we are committed to telling stories about these essential relationships. Theater isn’t going to single-handedly stop climate change. But we believe it can and must advocate strongly for social movements, lending its voice to amplify the direct political actions taking place in society. As a company, we see the opportunity in Edinburgh as the beginning of a long-term mission to realize these beliefs.</p>

<h3><strong>Speaking of which, tell me about this ""Edinburgh Fringe.""</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.edfringe.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Edinburgh Fringe</a> is the largest of its kind in the world, <strong>selling over 2.5 million tickets in its record-breaking 2017 season</strong>. For an emerging theater company, it provides the opportunity for unrivalled exposure to new audiences, fellow artists, and members of the press through 23 performances over the course of a month.</p>
<p>Thousands of shows are accepted into the festival (from theatre to comedy to music). With so many shows performing, the best way to stand out from the crowd is to be selected by a reputable venue. We are excited to announce we will perform in a primetime slot at <a href=""http://www.zoovenues.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>ZOO Venues</strong></a>, <strong>“a premier location for an international programme of dance and physical theatre” (The Herald).</strong></p>
<p>Even with the help of their host venues, companies are responsible for marketing their show and bringing sizable audiences to recoup production costs. Artists spend their days before performances selling tickets by way of innovative street performances, from music, to magic tricks, to pure spectacle. We think our show is a great fit for the festival and <strong>know that Mercury Daniels (our pedal-powered bicycle) will turn heads on the streets of Edinburgh.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Where is my money going?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Artist payments: 22% </strong>($6,700)</p>
<p>In addition to compensating actors with airfare, housing for the month, and a stipend, we'll need to assemble a team of designers (and a director and stage manager) to help prepare the show for its launch in Edinburgh. </p>
<p><strong>Marketing and promotion: 17% </strong>($5,200)</p>
<p>The Edinburgh Fringe, with its vastness of shows, relies on performers to do a good deal of self-promotion. And it's not like comedy shows in Times Square - for the month of August, this kind of interaction actually works. The more we can stop passersby on the streets, the more seats we'll fill in the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Production costs: 11% </strong>($3,200)</p>
<p>At the end of the day, the play itself is the most important component to our success over in Edinburgh. Our set will be somewhat minimalist to highlight the pedal-powered bicycle, but we will still need materials for set design, funds for rehearsal rentals, and equipment for lighting and sound design. Thankfully, we're able to reuse resources and equipment from our last run, like the synthesizer Robert plays throughout the show. (Shout Out to all previous supporters!)</p>
<p><strong>Housing accommodation: 17% </strong>($5,000)</p>
<p>We'll be performing the show 23 times in just under four weeks. With such an intense commitment, the need for quiet, comfortable housing is of great importance! </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Producing a show at the Edinburgh Fringe can be risky business. Since much of the marketing and publicity work will depend on us, we have no way of guaranteeing a certain box office projection. Positive reviews and smart marketing strategies could give way to a successful financial venture, but with over 3,000 shows performing during the same month, it is possible for shows to blend in with the crowd.</p>
<p>With your support, we plan to rise to this challenge and mitigate these risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>While in Edinburgh, a significant portion of our time will be dedicated to on-the-ground marketing. We believe aspects of our production (the bicycle, live music, etc.) <strong>will give us an edge over traditional marketing strategies.</strong>
</li>
<li>We plan to aggressively contact UK-based publications and news organizations to <strong>generate as much press as possible ahead of the festival.</strong>
</li>
<li>The Edinburgh Fringe Society offers some <strong>fail-safes in the case of low ticket sales</strong>. Offers like the Half-Price Ticket Hut, Comp Give-Aways for preview performances, and Royal Mile “Street Events” all give performers the chance to draw in audience members when things aren’t going so well.</li>
<li>Part of our fundraising accounts for a contingency of 10% of our total projected expenses. We will keep this in reserve <strong>to be sure that we can take advantage of any opportunities that come our way</strong>, such as printing and distributing reviews, continued interaction with members of the press, and maintaining a consistent marketing strategy.</li>
<li>Before performing in Edinburgh we will be staging the show for 3 performances, July 24th, 25th, and 28th at <a href=""http://www.59e59.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">59E59</a> as a dry-run before we head East.

</div></div>","Workshop performance at Rockwall Studios, Brooklyn. September 2017.
Solarplexus? I thought that was the third chakra of power and wisdom?
You're right. It is. But it's also a sci-fi comedy about the apocalypse, environmentalism, and corporate greed.
With a climate-change apocalypse approaching, Ellen and her corporatized brother seek refuge on their father's sustainable, eco-friendly commune. His plan to save the world? A gender-fluid, pedal-powered bicycle named Mercury Daniels. But you'd better hope they can set aside their differences before the CEO of that mega tech corporation, Syzygy, gets his hands on them. Will the family overcome their clashing beliefs and save the world with the forces of renewable energy?
Outside of the world of the play, Solarplexus is committed to the values of its script through action. One year ago, when we staged the first production of the play at Rockwall Studios in Brooklyn, we partnered with André Feliciano to build a pedal-powered bicycle as a set piece, able to convert mechanical energy (pedaling) into electrical energy (the show’s lighting), and simultaneously function as a central part of the story’s plot. The bicycle stored energy as well, and we are proud to have successfully powered all of the production’s lights through our pedal-powered bicycle, Mercury. We also used solar power and only LED bulbs in lighting the show.
As a group of artists, we believe in the intersection between art and the environment, between storytelling and science, and we are committed to telling stories about these essential relationships. Theater isn’t going to single-handedly stop climate change. But we believe it can and must advocate strongly for social movements, lending its voice to amplify the direct political actions taking place in society. As a company, we see the opportunity in Edinburgh as the beginning of a long-term mission to realize these beliefs.

Speaking of which, tell me about this ""Edinburgh Fringe.""
The Edinburgh Fringe is the largest of its kind in the world, selling over 2.5 million tickets in its record-breaking 2017 season. For an emerging theater company, it provides the opportunity for unrivalled exposure to new audiences, fellow artists, and members of the press through 23 performances over the course of a month.
Thousands of shows are accepted into the festival (from theatre to comedy to music). With so many shows performing, the best way to stand out from the crowd is to be selected by a reputable venue. We are excited to announce we will perform in a primetime slot at ZOO Venues, “a premier location for an international programme of dance and physical theatre” (The Herald).
Even with the help of their host venues, companies are responsible for marketing their show and bringing sizable audiences to recoup production costs. Artists spend their days before performances selling tickets by way of innovative street performances, from music, to magic tricks, to pure spectacle. We think our show is a great fit for the festival and know that Mercury Daniels (our pedal-powered bicycle) will turn heads on the streets of Edinburgh.

Where is my money going?
Artist payments: 22% ($6,700)
In addition to compensating actors with airfare, housing for the month, and a stipend, we'll need to assemble a team of designers (and a director and stage manager) to help prepare the show for its launch in Edinburgh. 
Marketing and promotion: 17% ($5,200)
The Edinburgh Fringe, with its vastness of shows, relies on performers to do a good deal of self-promotion. And it's not like comedy shows in Times Square - for the month of August, this kind of interaction actually works. The more we can stop passersby on the streets, the more seats we'll fill in the audience.
Production costs: 11% ($3,200)
At the end of the day, the play itself is the most important component to our success over in Edinburgh. Our set will be somewhat minimalist to highlight the pedal-powered bicycle, but we will still need materials for set design, funds for rehearsal rentals, and equipment for lighting and sound design. Thankfully, we're able to reuse resources and equipment from our last run, like the synthesizer Robert plays throughout the show. (Shout Out to all previous supporters!)
Housing accommodation: 17% ($5,000)
We'll be performing the show 23 times in just under four weeks. With such an intense commitment, the need for quiet, comfortable housing is of great importance! 
Transportation: 16% ($4,700)
Scotland is very far! Money is hard to make! In order to make the project more financially feasible for the artists involved, we're offering to cover round trip airfare to Edinburgh. 
Contingency: 17% ($5,200)
Due to the international travel aspect of this project, we will need to reserve a portion of total expenses in case of any unforeseen circumstances.
Woah, that's a bigger budget than you're fundraising for!?
Yes it is. Thanks to personal investments and previous fundraising, we are just under ⅔ of the way towards raising our budget. We’ve come to Indiegogo because we need your help, we need a final push to get that last ⅓ and ensure that Solarplexus: An Alternative Energy Play has as large an impact as possible at The Fringe this summer. (And that we don't go into debt!)

We believe that now is the time for live performance to put its spotlight on the extreme danger our planet faces; to tell exciting, powerful stories with an ecological bent, and through them, offer creative solutions.
Our goals at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe include:

Commission an artist to create easy-to-read cartoons explaining how to build several of the DIY renewable energy projects we learned to build from André Feliciano.

Reach a large and engaged international audience with not just our performance, but with street demonstrations of our pedal-powered bicycle and our cartoons explaining how to build several DIY renewable energy projects.
Create an exciting, powerful play that demonstrates it is possible, and not inherently a cost-prohibitive venture, to stage a show that is ecologically conscious, not just on the page but in reality as well.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>MANY RIVERS CROSSED</u></h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><i>Many Rivers Crossed </i>is a new solo play written by Richard Canal, co-directed with George Goodell, and performed by Emeson Nwolie, due to premier at the Landor_Space in London, UK from September 5th to 11th of 2018 and then at the Cockpit (also in London) from September 18th to 23rd. Although some resources are available, we unfortunately do not have enough to cover all the costs; and, thus, we are turning to crowdfunding.</p>
<h3>About the Play</h3>
<p>It is February 22nd, 2002. Ambushed at breakfast in the open savanna of eastern Angola, Jonas Savimbi—the infamous warlord and leader of the UNITA rebels—has just been killed by government troops. After twenty-seven years of civil war, since independence in 1975, what was one of Africa’s longest and deadliest conflicts has at long last reached its inevitable end. Angolans will soon dance and rejoice in the streets at the demise of the man many condemn as the sole perpetuator of the war: Savimbi’s personal vendetta against the incumbent party, and against Angola as a whole for not having chosen him in the 1992 elections, resulted in the loss of 500,000 lives, and left a country that could have been the continent’s richest among its poorest. He suddenly wakes up—dead, bullet-ridden and surrounded by a tribunal of the ghosts of those killed by his hubris. He is confronted by the pain he has wreaked on Angola; and in an attempt to have his soul depart this limbo in peace, he explains himself—but whether he is willing apologise and repent is unclear.</p>
<p>The audience, when entering the space, becomes an active judicial court reminiscent of those in central African tradition,  sitting around the space and facing both Savimbi and each other, present to judge over his after-death fate. The ideal experience in viewing his madness will be for the audience to feel a stimulant anger—much in the way theatre of the oppressed does—in the name of action against others’ tyranny, but also against that which they might find within themselves.</p>
<p><i>Many Rivers Crossed</i> explores themes including the crimes of colonialism and the mistakes of decolonisation, war's madness and addictions and depravities, the effects of individuals' decisions and temperaments on history's trajectories, and the ethics of truth and reconciliation. It condemns without demonising, and humanizes without sympathising, the obsessions of a warlord, in order to find a semblance of meaning in humankind’s propensity for power-thirst and pride. It will engage audiences to reflect on war: its nature; its causes; our tendencies towards it. Is Jonas Savimbi a character unique in his megalomania? Was he simply a product of sociopolitical forces, including colonialism, imperialism and the Cold War? Was he an aberration? Or was he an inevitability, even a universality?</p>
<h3>About the Production</h3>
<p><i>Many Rivers Crossed</i> aims to be a socially-engaged production. Attendees will become involved not only as viewers of the play itself, but also as attendees to post-show discussions with experts from fields outside of theatre and to a celebration of Angolan history and culture, commemorating not only those gone due to the civil conflict but also those still with us today. We will also be holding a raffle every evening in support of the HALO Trust (<a href=""https://www.halotrust.org/where-we-work/africa/angola/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.halotrust.org/where-we-work/africa/...</a>), an NGO dedicated to de-mining in post-conflict countries (including Angola, the country with the most mines and unexploded ordnances in the world), so the audience themselves will have an impact on the future of Angola.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Landor_Space is located around the centre of London's lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) communities, making it connected with those to whom the narrative is most relevant. <i>Many Rivers Crossed </i>will also go through research and development workshops for both exclusively Angolan and also general audiences to ensure that there is full sensitivity and awareness of the real-life experiences of those who struggled and suffered during the civil war.</p>
<h3>About the Team</h3>
<p><strong>Richard Canal (writer, director and producer)</strong> is a theatre practitioner from Spain and the United States. He recently debuted as solo performer and writer of <i>Cry, Blueberry</i> at the Cockpit during the Camden Fringe; then in January 2018 for a sell-out, four-star-reviewed, in-kind run; at the Warren for the 2018 Brighton Fringe; and soon at the 2018 Gothenburg Fringe and the Brighton Open Air Theatre.

</div><div>
<h3>About the Costs</h3>
<p>The Landor_Space has granted us their theatre facilities for free, with a 60/40 split in our favor, so this fortunately removes that expense. Our focus is on the costume, props, set, marketing materials and team. The costs are listed here in order; as donations come in, each will be ticked off one by one, from least to most expensive. In this way, we hope to be able to cover as much with this campaign as possible!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><u>EXPECTED COSTS</u><br/>Costume </b><strong>(<i>beret, shirt, pants, and boots</i>): </strong>£100<br/><strong>Props (<i>replica revolver, walkie-talkie</i>): </strong>£100<br/><strong>Set (<i>benches, dirt, fake grass): </i></strong>£100<br/><strong>Marketing materials (<i>posters, flyers, etc.</i>): </strong>£150<br/><b>Lighting and sound technician (<i>to be considered</i>): </b>£600<br/><b>Public relations manager (<i>Chris Hislop</i>): </b>£800<br/><b>Actor (<i>Emeson Nwolie</i>): </b>£2,700<br/><strong>Contingency buffer: </strong>£200</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>TOTAL COSTS: </strong>£4,750</u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><u>INDEPENDENT FUNDING: </u></b><u>£1,250</u></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>FUNDS REQUIRED: </strong>£3,500</u></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>About the Risks</h3>
<p>With Chris's notable expertise in the art of getting people into theatres, and our experience in getting full houses for all five nights of <i>Cry, Blueberry</i> through targeted social media and outreach, we have faith that <i>Many Rivers Crossed</i> will garner audiences. Nevertheless, there are risks that could portend otherwise, as with every fledgling theatre work (especially in a city as theatre-packed as London).</p>
<p>We will be doing the following:</p>
<p>1.) Hiring Chris Hislop, a great freelance PR professional who has worked on many fringe and professional productions, to handle the press release, interviews, promotions and a press night;<br/>2.) Using a customised Facebook page and promoting on a schedule, using personal invites in particular;<br/>3.)

Introduction
Many Rivers Crossed is a new solo play written by Richard Canal, co-directed with George Goodell, and performed by Emeson Nwolie, due to premier at the Landor_Space in London, UK from September 5th to 11th of 2018 and then at the Cockpit (also in London) from September 18th to 23rd. Although some resources are available, we unfortunately do not have enough to cover all the costs; and, thus, we are turning to crowdfunding.
About the Play
It is February 22nd, 2002. Ambushed at breakfast in the open savanna of eastern Angola, Jonas Savimbi—the infamous warlord and leader of the UNITA rebels—has just been killed by government troops. After twenty-seven years of civil war, since independence in 1975, what was one of Africa’s longest and deadliest conflicts has at long last reached its inevitable end. Angolans will soon dance and rejoice in the streets at the demise of the man many condemn as the sole perpetuator of the war: Savimbi’s personal vendetta against the incumbent party, and against Angola as a whole for not having chosen him in the 1992 elections, resulted in the loss of 500,000 lives, and left a country that could have been the continent’s richest among its poorest. He suddenly wakes up—dead, bullet-ridden and surrounded by a tribunal of the ghosts of those killed by his hubris. He is confronted by the pain he has wreaked on Angola; and in an attempt to have his soul depart this limbo in peace, he explains himself—but whether he is willing apologise and repent is unclear.
The audience, when entering the space, becomes an active judicial court reminiscent of those in central African tradition,  sitting around the space and facing both Savimbi and each other, present to judge over his after-death fate. The ideal experience in viewing his madness will be for the audience to feel a stimulant anger—much in the way theatre of the oppressed does—in the name of action against others’ tyranny, but also against that which they might find within themselves.
Many Rivers Crossed explores themes including the crimes of colonialism and the mistakes of decolonisation, war's madness and addictions and depravities, the effects of individuals' decisions and temperaments on history's trajectories, and the ethics of truth and reconciliation. It condemns without demonising, and humanizes without sympathising, the obsessions of a warlord, in order to find a semblance of meaning in humankind’s propensity for power-thirst and pride. It will engage audiences to reflect on war: its nature; its causes; our tendencies towards it. Is Jonas Savimbi a character unique in his megalomania? Was he simply a product of sociopolitical forces, including colonialism, imperialism and the Cold War? Was he an aberration? Or was he an inevitability, even a universality?
About the Production
Many Rivers Crossed aims to be a socially-engaged production. Attendees will become involved not only as viewers of the play itself, but also as attendees to post-show discussions with experts from fields outside of theatre and to a celebration of Angolan history and culture, commemorating not only those gone due to the civil conflict but also those still with us today. We will also be holding a raffle every evening in support of the HALO Trust (https://www.halotrust.org/where-we-work/africa/...), an NGO dedicated to de-mining in post-conflict countries (including Angola, the country with the most mines and unexploded ordnances in the world), so the audience themselves will have an impact on the future of Angola.
Furthermore, the Landor_Space is located around the centre of London's lusophone (Portuguese-speaking) communities, making it connected with those to whom the narrative is most relevant. Many Rivers Crossed will also go through research and development workshops for both exclusively Angolan and also general audiences to ensure that there is full sensitivity and awareness of the real-life experiences of those who struggled and suffered during the civil war.
About the Team
Richard Canal (writer, director and producer) is a theatre practitioner from Spain and the United States. He recently debuted as solo performer and writer of Cry, Blueberry at the Cockpit during the Camden Fringe; then in January 2018 for a sell-out, four-star-reviewed, in-kind run; at the Warren for the 2018 Brighton Fringe; and soon at the 2018 Gothenburg Fringe and the Brighton Open Air Theatre. Combining his equal passions for the humanities and the dramatic arts, Richard obtained his BA in Human Rights and an MSc in Violence, Conflict and Development, and focuses on theatre for reconciliation.
George Goodell (co-director and stage manager) is an award-winning playwright and director from the United States. He was awarded as best director in the 2018 New Short Play Festival for The Ring, which he also wrote. George has written and directed for both theatre and film in the US and the UK.
Emeson Nwolie (actor) is a British-Nigerian singer-songwriter, actor, producer, remixer and writer with extensive film experience in movies such as Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Assassin's Creed, Doctor Strange, Jason Bourne, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story and Guardians of the Galaxy. Emeson has been part of the Saturn's Children ensemble as singer-songwriter with the producer Karmasound, works collaboratively as singer-songwriter with producer K15 for the Profusion group and is also a singer-songwriter contributor to the Carla Duke music project which includes acclaimed Swedish singer-songwriter Roselie. Emeson has also appeared on numerous compilations such as Freeness, Tokyo Dawn's The Heart 3, BBE BamaLoveSoul and Jazz Cafe Volume 10, both solo and collaboratively. His credits may be found at https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5619937/.
Chris Hislop (press relations manager) is a British-German theatre creative, with extensive experience as a producer, writer and director, including with widespread fringe and Off West End in London (such as the King's Head Theatre and LOST Theatre) and work at the Brighton, Edinburgh and Camden Fringes. He has recently started working on live tabletop role-playing games as a creative producer and live games master. His work may be found at https://www.chrishislop.com/.

About the Costs
The Landor_Space has granted us their theatre facilities for free, with a 60/40 split in our favor, so this fortunately removes that expense. Our focus is on the costume, props, set, marketing materials and team. The costs are listed here in order; as donations come in, each will be ticked off one by one, from least to most expensive. In this way, we hope to be able to cover as much with this campaign as possible!
EXPECTED COSTSCostume (beret, shirt, pants, and boots): £100Props (replica revolver, walkie-talkie): £100Set (benches, dirt, fake grass): £100Marketing materials (posters, flyers, etc.): £150Lighting and sound technician (to be considered): £600Public relations manager (Chris Hislop): £800Actor (Emeson Nwolie): £2,700Contingency buffer: £200
TOTAL COSTS: £4,750
INDEPENDENT FUNDING: £1,250
FUNDS REQUIRED: £3,500

 
About the Risks
With Chris's notable expertise in the art of getting people into theatres, and our experience in getting full houses for all five nights of Cry, Blueberry through targeted social media and outreach, we have faith that Many Rivers Crossed will garner audiences. Nevertheless, there are risks that could portend otherwise, as with every fledgling theatre work (especially in a city as theatre-packed as London).
We will be doing the following:
1.) Hiring Chris Hislop, a great freelance PR professional who has worked on many fringe and professional productions, to handle the press release, interviews, promotions and a press night;2.) Using a customised Facebook page and promoting on a schedule, using personal invites in particular;3.) Sending out personalised invites to industry professionals, including literary agents;4.) Reaching out to relevant organisations, including the Angolan Embassy and especially ones that focus on the African diaspora.
Additionally, we believe the most relevant audience groups are Angolans and other lusophone communities in London; people from the sub-Saharan and central African diasporas; theatre-goers interested in solo show, socio-political works and/or historical pieces; and people of British and other nationalities, even if not generally theatre-goers, interested in the Global South.

New Industry Dance will continue to bring high-quality performances, outreach, and open classes to the community. We believe movement is a means to examine ourselves, each other, and the culture around us. Through embodiment practices, we bring intention and personal experience to the forefront of work that is socially aware and emotionally engaging.</p>
<p>As we prepare for our fifth season of dance in South Bend, we need your support. Your contribution will allow us to continue to collaborate and dialogue with voices in our community to create work born of diverse perspectives, art that inspires deeper thought, invites questions, and highlights human experiences rather than performance that tells you what to think and answers all the questions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>New Industry Dance needs your to help to raise $7500. All funds raised will go toward production costs for the 2018-2019 season and allow us to strengthen our commitment to quality dance work in the community.</p> <p>Your contribution will assist in covering artistic and production costs, including:</p>
<p>Dancer stipends</p>
<p>Venue fees</p>
<p>Costuming fees (design, construction, materials)</p>
<p>Collaborating artist compensation</p>
<p>Marketing (print/web, graphic design, printing costs)</p>

<p>New Industry Dance is a team of 8 artists: Chloe Ilene (Artistic Director), Anna Greenawalt, Joanna Whitmyer, Maia Sutter, Sharon Sims, Mallory McAfee (dancers), Patrick Quigley (Company Composer), and Johan Godwaldt (Lighting Designer).</p>
<p>Our season contains public performances in the fall and spring.</p>
<p>Depending on your contribution level, you will receive supporter merchandise (sticker or T-Shirt), an invite to visit a rehearsal, mutual benefit support through program mentions or brand visibility on our website. At the highest level, you will enjoy a full-length preview of a work and enjoy a Happy Hour with the artistic director and company dancers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>New Industry Dance brings a unique artistic voice to South Bend’s young and rapidly growing arts community. We strive to elevate dance as an important and valued language of creative expression here.</p>
<p>In the past, as Fischer Dance, we brought more than 40 public performances to South Bend. Our work often includes a broad range of voices from the community. A primary way we do this is by inviting everyone to share personal perspectives and engage in movement experiences at our free movement classes. These classes help us build community and deepen our creative research process.</p>
<p>Going forward, New Industry Dance would like to create even more opportunities for engagement and education. Potential opportunities include pioneering a summer intensive program for adults and hosting more movement workshops and mini-series. We also hope to deepen our community impact by developing stronger partnerships with organizations in South Bend who share similar visions.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Historically, Fischer Dance has produced all of its work with the support of fewer than 10 donors. Up until now, our founding artistic director financed much of our production costs. Going forward, we must increase our donor pool. We hope you will be among the needed 50-100 financial backers. Combined, your donations show a community commitment to prioritizing dance as an important language of creative expression.</p>
<p>We want to sustain and build on our modern dance endeavors, but our greatest challenge is to build an audience for modern dance in South Bend. Two standard ways we have confronted this challenge is by prioritizing education on the language of dance and increasing transparency in our creative process. Our Movement Lab is a safe space where you can engage in movement exercises and converse about your own movement experience. And after each performance, we engage in talk-backs where we encourage you to ask questions and engage in dialogue surrounding our work.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot help fund this campaign right now, you can always contribute by sharing our fundraiser with others who may want to help. The Indiegogo share tools make it easy to spread the word!</p>
<p>In the meantime, stay tuned by following us on social media or subscribing to our email list. We hope to see you at a dance event soon!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi There!  Thank You for taking the time to read about our first event for 2020 with an eye on donating to our project!  I'm Julie Heffner, freelance ballet dancer, choreographer and director.  I am working in Bellevue, Washington with CITY OPERA BALLET, a non-profit organization, to bring an amazing, hard-working and talented group of classically trained ballet dancers to Timber Ridge Senior Living this Valentin's Day.  We are excited about your  support for our budget to bring the rare experience of professional ballet to this arts-loving senior audience while assuring the viability of dance careers in our community!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All funds go directly to paying six dancers for their work.  Our goal is to raise $1,000 to cover a $200 Director/Choreography fee and $200 for each dancer.  An exciting start of $400 already serves as a generous welcome mat for your participation in our campaign.<i> For the opportunity of a tax deduction, please refer to our website for your donation <a href=""http://www.cityoperaballet.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cityoperaballet.org</a></i></p>

<p> </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>  Even a small compensation goes a long way in a dancer's life.  We spend hours staying in shape, rehearsing and choreographing to bring our A  game to the sage.  Mastering our art since childhood has lead us to reach now for your hand.  Help us to hold onto our life's mission:  to dance!</p>
</div><div>

Hi There!  Thank You for taking the time to read about our first event for 2020 with an eye on donating to our project!  I'm Julie Heffner, freelance ballet dancer, choreographer and director.  I am working in Bellevue, Washington with CITY OPERA BALLET, a non-profit organization, to bring an amazing, hard-working and talented group of classically trained ballet dancers to Timber Ridge Senior Living this Valentin's Day.  We are excited about your  support for our budget to bring the rare experience of professional ballet to this arts-loving senior audience while assuring the viability of dance careers in our community!

What We Need & What You Get
All funds go directly to paying six dancers for their work.  Our goal is to raise $1,000 to cover a $200 Director/Choreography fee and $200 for each dancer.  An exciting start of $400 already serves as a generous welcome mat for your participation in our campaign. For the opportunity of a tax deduction, please refer to our website for your donation www.cityoperaballet.org
We offer many levels of fun gifts to thank you for your contribution, including:  Thank You letters from the dancers,  donor mentions in all CITY OPERA BALLET 2020 Season programs, hand-made personalized wood burned Valentines and even help a low income student reivcie a free private lesson!
Should we fail to reach our goal, any funds raised will be used to pay the dancers.
 

The Impact
  Even a small compensation goes a long way in a dancer's life.  We spend hours staying in shape, rehearsing and choreographing to bring our A  game to the sage.  Mastering our art since childhood has lead us to reach now for your hand.  Help us to hold onto our life's mission:  to dance!

Risks & Challenges
  For the past 55 years through unimaginable changes in our City,  our company has ""grown like Topsy""  with our firm conviction to Never Give Up!
Other Ways You Can Help
  If you cannot contribute financially, you still have a big role to play!  Help us get the word out by making some noise about our Indiegogo campaign on your social media!  Volunteer your time!  There is a place for everyone at the ballet!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>In order to make the venue what we want and need it to be, there are a few things we need to add to the space (right now it is a beautiful empty room with wood floors):</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to build a small stage for our live music and dj needs</li>
<li>In order to play music so everyone can hear it, we need a sound system (not our travel bluetooth speakers)</li>
<li>In order to serve beverages and snacks, we need a bar to separate the dance space from the serving space</li>
<li>We need coolers and shelves to store alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages</li>
<li>Permits, Holy cow so many permits. Business, occupancy, health, liquor. Each of these takes time AND money</li>
<li>So that it doesn't feel like a retail store, we need to replace some overhead lights. We want atmosphere and these current babies do not give it.</li>
<li>We need some chairs for people to sit in and some tables for people to put their drinks on</li>
</ul>

<ul><li>If we don't hit our goal, it doesn't mean this won't happen! There is enough money in personal savings to cover these costs, but it does mean we may live off top ramen for a long time, and well, top ramen doesn't have a lot of health benefits.</li></ul>

All of the rewards from the previous campaign are still available and any extra money would be a huge help in making sure the cast and crew are fed and watered on their journey to bring Cimrman to America!</p><h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3><p>We are the <strong>Cimrman English Theatre</strong> - a group of English speaking actors living in the Czech Republic dedicated to performing the works of <strong>Jára Cimrman</strong>. Anyone who has lived here will have crossed the name of Jára Cimrman. He is a fictitious character of a Czech genius, who lived at the turn of the 20th century and who is dear to every Czech heart. Ask the nearest Czech!</p><p>Czechs are so proud of him that in 2005 he won a nationwide poll for <strong>the greatest Czech</strong>. Every Czech we talked to - including the character's creators - insisted his comedy was untranslatable. But we proved them wrong! In 2014 we performed a staged reading of <strong><i>The Stand-In (Záskok)</i></strong>. It was a huge success, covered by the media, and our audience was as excited as Zdeněk Svěrák, the last surviving creator of Cimrman. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490962357/blmwosh14fy2xp0rqstc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Z. Svěrák - Czech national treasure.</p><p>We have been playing ever since. We love it and are extremely proud to be spreading the good word about the Czech Republic, which has become our second home. Our audience is mixed Czech and foreign. In a lot of cases Czechs bring along their foreign partners and friends. It's a unique chance to share this comedy, which is so dear, with those they love.</p><p>Somewhere along the line we thought, <strong>wouldn't it be great to bring Cimrman to America</strong>? There are so many Czechs, who have English-speaking partners and families, Czechs, who do not speak Czech any more or simply admirers of Czech culture! Watching Cimrman in English is the perfect way to share this iconic piece of Czech culture with them!</p><p>That is how the project began and now we are almost there! With the great support of the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we hope to perform Jára Cimrman's <i>Stand-in (Záskok) </i>- a witty play about a theater troupe that hires a stand-in at the last minute and hilarity ensues.</p><p><u>Tour dates (2017), <strong>all tickets are FREE:</strong></u></p><p><strong>April 19 &amp; 22, 7PM </strong>at the Bohemian Hall, the Czech Center in New York, (between 1st and 2nd Avenue) 321 E 73rd Street, New York, NY 10021</p><p><strong>April 21, 8PM</strong> at the Hostelling International NYC, 891 Amsterdam Avenue, NY</p><p><u><a href=""https://www.eventbrite.com/d/ny--new-york/cimrman/?mode=search"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tickets for New York shows</a></u></p><p><strong>April 26 &amp; 27</strong> <strong>6:30pm </strong>at the Abramson Family Auditorium, New York University, 1307 L Street, NW.

All of the rewards from the previous campaign are still available and any extra money would be a huge help in making sure the cast and crew are fed and watered on their journey to bring Cimrman to America!Short SummaryWe are the Cimrman English Theatre - a group of English speaking actors living in the Czech Republic dedicated to performing the works of Jára Cimrman. Anyone who has lived here will have crossed the name of Jára Cimrman. He is a fictitious character of a Czech genius, who lived at the turn of the 20th century and who is dear to every Czech heart. Ask the nearest Czech!Czechs are so proud of him that in 2005 he won a nationwide poll for the greatest Czech. Every Czech we talked to - including the character's creators - insisted his comedy was untranslatable. But we proved them wrong! In 2014 we performed a staged reading of The Stand-In (Záskok). It was a huge success, covered by the media, and our audience was as excited as Zdeněk Svěrák, the last surviving creator of Cimrman. Z. Svěrák - Czech national treasure.We have been playing ever since. We love it and are extremely proud to be spreading the good word about the Czech Republic, which has become our second home. Our audience is mixed Czech and foreign. In a lot of cases Czechs bring along their foreign partners and friends. It's a unique chance to share this comedy, which is so dear, with those they love.Somewhere along the line we thought, wouldn't it be great to bring Cimrman to America? There are so many Czechs, who have English-speaking partners and families, Czechs, who do not speak Czech any more or simply admirers of Czech culture! Watching Cimrman in English is the perfect way to share this iconic piece of Czech culture with them!That is how the project began and now we are almost there! With the great support of the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we hope to perform Jára Cimrman's Stand-in (Záskok) - a witty play about a theater troupe that hires a stand-in at the last minute and hilarity ensues.Tour dates (2017), all tickets are FREE:April 19 & 22, 7PM at the Bohemian Hall, the Czech Center in New York, (between 1st and 2nd Avenue) 321 E 73rd Street, New York, NY 10021April 21, 8PM at the Hostelling International NYC, 891 Amsterdam Avenue, NYTickets for New York showsApril 26 & 27 6:30pm at the Abramson Family Auditorium, New York University, 1307 L Street, NW.

The Czech diplomatic missions to the USA have been incredibly helpful, they will provide theater space, accommodation for our team and even lend us a bus. We have been incredibly humbled by the overwhelming support we got from our fans who contributed to our airline tickets. Here is a link to our first Indiegogo campaign. Nevertheless, we continue to raise money to cover our meals. If you did not contribute the first time, now is your chance!
 With your contribution the world will finally be able to learn the truth about this forgotten genius: the man who advised Chekhov that a play about just two sisters wasn't dramatic enough and who invented TNT only to arrive to the patent office two minutes after Alfred Nobel had patented his own version of dynamite. J. Cimrman's bust - no one knows what he looked like. What We Need & What You GetThe bulk of the money we need to raise will fund our meals while in the US. There will be 8 of us (6 cast members + 2 support staff) and the total sum for the provisions is 3000 USD. As mentioned our accommodation, theater venues and a bus with a driver will be provided by the Czech diplomatic missions. We are also in the process of getting corporate sponsors, whose contribution will help cover transportation and manufacturing of the set. We do not expect to be paid!For your contribution, we are prepared to welcome you in the fold of science - you may become a cimrmanologist and even an honorary member of the Cimrman English Theatre!Cimrman's Stand-In is also a love story! Vogeltanz (M. Pitthan) and Vlasta (C. Matthew)The ImpactDuring our tour we are hoping to reach approximately 800 viewers during our 5 shows. In addition to that David Smoljak, son of Ladislav Smoljak (one of the co-authors Jára Cimrman's plays) is preparing a documentary about our tour, which will be financed separately. We will be accompanied by him and also by reporters from the Czech Radio. Last but not least, we will be keeping in touch with you in our video journal documenting our trip!Risks & ChallengesThe biggest risk is that we will not be able to raise enough money for our meals. We have thought long and hard about a crowd funding strategy: should we be raising money on a Czech site since Jára Cimrman is a Czech hero? In the end we concluded that all of our audience members speak English after all and we opted for Indiegogo. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you cannot contribute, please, let your friends and family know about the shows! If they have never heard about Jára Cimrman, explain it to them. As we like to say - Ask the nearest Czech!Do not forget to share our fantastic videos! And like us on Facebook. What Does Our Audience Say? ""Yesterday was my 3rd time with you guys, and I laughed all over again right from the start. You are making your performance better and better..."" (Facebook)""Great fun, excellent translation and hilarious actors. Great opportunity to finally show this jewel of Czech literature to my friends!"" (Facebook)""Unbelievably good adaptation of Cimrman's plays.

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>angrybrowngirl productions is coming to the MTL Fringe with Love Painted Brown, a heartfelt piece that paints a picture of race, womanhood, activism, and love – in shades of brown. </p>
<p>Love Painted Brown is about simultaneity. Grounded in the stories that colour an Indian/Mexican woman's upbringing in an African-American family, the work performs academia and analyzes story. Piece by piece, Shanti Gonzales invites the audience to join her in deconstructing previously held notions of race, gender, class and more. Part performance, part seminar, part RIOT – Love Painted Brown is about getting one's hand dirty in order to sift through what it means to claim brown womanhood in 2017.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We are looking to raise $1000 to put on this show. Your contributions will go toward...</h3>
<ul>
<li>The $500 entrance fee for performing at the Fringe. </li>
<li>Paying some passionate emerging female-identified artists for their hard work. Artists like...<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sky Erickson</strong> for her dope graphic design.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hannah Kirby</strong> and <strong>Claire Bourdin</strong> for their innovation and patience with all things technical.</li>
<li>
<strong>Holly Hilts</strong> for the imagination and resourcefulness in her set design.</li>
<li>
<strong>Yasmin Bitar</strong> for keeping everyone sane and organized day in and day out.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cara Krisman</strong> and <strong>Myrna Wyatt-Selkirk</strong> for their creativity and wisdom as acting coaches.</li>
<li>
<strong>Shanti Gonzales</strong> for digging up old journals and putting a voice to what it really looks, feels, and tastes like to be brown -- in her mission to <u>confront a society's fear of the dark</u>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project centralizes the realities of brown womanhood in the age of Trump by sharing one woman's lived experience. It is meant to tell the stories that haven't yet been told, to demonstrate caring and practical ways to engage in intersectional feminism, and to call out to the audience and hear their response. The piece talks <strong>Black Barbies</strong>, <strong>cumin</strong>, <strong>whiskey</strong>, <strong>academia</strong>, <strong>social media</strong>, <strong>Trudeau's hair</strong>, and more. </p>
<ul>
<li>As hate crimes increase and racism rears its ugly head publicly once more, it's stories like these that need to take the stage and assert their presence. We do this not only for the brown adults, but for the brown youth. <strong>For us, brown can refer to any POC-identified human</strong>. Ours is a project that tackles issues of representation and identity formation, and how the expectations of society, our families, our peers, and our selves influence our very Formation (spoiler alert: we love Beyoncé). </li>
<li>LPB has had two resoundingly successful presentations at McGill University, first as a Bachelor's thesis and then as a featured performance at McGill's Bodies in Difference conference in April. The Fringe stage is the next big step for us! angrybrowngirl productions is led by Shanti Gonzales, previously the director of CoffeeSpoons Theatre Project, a Boston-based theatre company unique for its simplicity and accessibility (all of our shows were in coffeehouses and bars!) and its ability to pay its young artists for their time and energy. <strong>Those salaries were paid entirely by Indiegogo contributions, for three years in a row</strong>! </li>
<li>If you have any questions about Love Painted Brown, its content, its mission, or its team, let us know! You can send us an email at shanti.gonzales@gmail.com. </li>
<li>Any amount helps. Anything from the cost of a black coffee (or unicorn Frappuccino) to a more sizable sum is deeply appreciated!</li>
</ul>

Sky Erickson for her dope graphic design.

Hannah Kirby and Claire Bourdin for their innovation and patience with all things technical.

Holly Hilts for the imagination and resourcefulness in her set design.

Yasmin Bitar for keeping everyone sane and organized day in and day out.

Cara Krisman and Myrna Wyatt-Selkirk for their creativity and wisdom as acting coaches.

Shanti Gonzales for digging up old journals and putting a voice to what it really looks, feels, and tastes like to be brown -- in her mission to confront a society's fear of the dark.




The Impact
This project centralizes the realities of brown womanhood in the age of Trump by sharing one woman's lived experience. It is meant to tell the stories that haven't yet been told, to demonstrate caring and practical ways to engage in intersectional feminism, and to call out to the audience and hear their response. The piece talks Black Barbies, cumin, whiskey, academia, social media, Trudeau's hair, and more. 

As hate crimes increase and racism rears its ugly head publicly once more, it's stories like these that need to take the stage and assert their presence. We do this not only for the brown adults, but for the brown youth. For us, brown can refer to any POC-identified human. Ours is a project that tackles issues of representation and identity formation, and how the expectations of society, our families, our peers, and our selves influence our very Formation (spoiler alert: we love Beyoncé). 
LPB has had two resoundingly successful presentations at McGill University, first as a Bachelor's thesis and then as a featured performance at McGill's Bodies in Difference conference in April. The Fringe stage is the next big step for us! angrybrowngirl productions is led by Shanti Gonzales, previously the director of CoffeeSpoons Theatre Project, a Boston-based theatre company unique for its simplicity and accessibility (all of our shows were in coffeehouses and bars!) and its ability to pay its young artists for their time and energy. Those salaries were paid entirely by Indiegogo contributions, for three years in a row! 
If you have any questions about Love Painted Brown, its content, its mission, or its team, let us know! You can send us an email at shanti.gonzales@gmail.com. 
Any amount helps. Anything from the cost of a black coffee (or unicorn Frappuccino) to a more sizable sum is deeply appreciated!

<p><strong>The Play:</strong> Mary’s husband, Crick, buys a painting with the last of their savings. Mary and Crick have a baby, but they can’t decide on the baby’s name, or the baby’s gender. A story of one woman’s education and her search to find true love outside the box.</p>
<p><strong>Why Late? Why now?:</strong> Late: A Cowboy Song embodies our goals as a company: challenging dualities and gender stereotypes, featuring women in roles as prominent and interesting as in real life, and showing complex and meaningful relationships between people of all genders. We feel that these kinds of plays are not produced often enough, in Philadelphia or really anywhere, and are excited to bring this thoughtful story to our community. Philadelphia theatregoers may already be familiar with the playwright, Sarah Ruhl. This celebrated writer has consistently featured a myriad of sincere, funny, interesting women from many different backgrounds in her body of work. Ruhl is one of the most important voices in American theatre right now, and we are delighted to be sharing her work with you for our first full production. </p>
<p><strong>Our Goal:</strong> Producing a play, especially one that is so relevant, requires a solid foundation from which to build. We are asking lovers of the arts, proponents of equality and cowboys at heart to donate any amount to help our young company realize this important piece. </p>
<p><strong>Plays are Expensive!</strong> We need your help to make this the best production it can possibly be. Making great theatre involves a lot of big expenses! Some you may already be able to guess (A suitable performance venue, paying artists for their hard work, set pieces, props, and lights). But many of these expenses are less visible to the average theatregoer: insurance costs, royalties to the publishing company and playwright, advertising, and all that coffee and water to keep us going in the rehearsal room!  By making a donation, big or small, to Late: A Cowboy Song, you are making all of this possible. Just $1 can buy a case of bottled water for the actors to stay hydrated backstage. $1000 can buy the royalties for every night we perform. Any contribution you can spare makes you an essential part of our production! </p>
<p><strong>Check out the Rewards.</strong> You'll see some tangible gifts, but most of the rewards are about getting you involved with the play by showing you exactly what your donation will create. You'll be able to see the show, listen to the music we create, taste Mary's famous clear soup, feel what a mechanical horse is like, and smell....the many smells of backstage. </p>
<p>You'll also notice that each of the rewards is named after an awesome lady from the history of the Wild West! We love women's history and hope you do too - ask us about any of these women you may not have heard of, or look up the one your reward is named for!</p>

<h2>Cosplay - The Show</h2>
<p>The worldwide phenomenon known as ""cosplay"" is a Japanese <a href=""http://www.dictionary.com/browse/portmanteau"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">portmanteau</a> of the English terms costume and play. With millions of people both participating and interested in the subculture and the varied themes such as superheroes, cartoon characters, video game characters; Cosplay The Show embraces cosplay with a Las Vegas flare.</p>
<p>The 70 minute production is set to perform in a major showroom on the Las Vegas strip featuring some of Las Vegas' most talented performers and a dizzying number of custom costumes and sets and props designed specifically for this production.</p>
<p>The Creator &amp; Producer, <i>Pete Housley</i>, is no stranger to Las Vegas production shows and showrooms he's been the Director of Operations for Planet Hollywood's <i>Sin City Theatre</i> for the past four years, the Executive Producer of the Award Winning <strong>Sin City Comedy &amp; Burlesque</strong>; as well as the marketing and creative consultant for <strong>Crazy Girls</strong> and <strong>Xavier Mortimer's Magical Dream</strong>.  As a huge fan of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Gaming, Housley has developed a Live Las Vegas show true the nature and culture of Fans and Cosplayers alike featuring many of his own favorite characters re-imagined for the Glitz and Glamour of Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Two potential venues have been selected for this production which cannot be announced at this time; however both are located on the Las Vegas strip in highly recognized properties and will have the support of these properties.</p>
<h3>The sizzle reel here is just a sample of some of the many Cosplay costumes we've been designing; there's a lot more to the show itself from set pieces, choreography, script and music -- but it's true to it's essence and foundation that it's all about the Cosplay.</h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Dozens of Las Vegas shows open and close every year; 2016 saw a huge number of large production shows close due to cast and labor costs combined with smaller paid audiences. Creator &amp; Producer, Pete Housley, has been working in the Las Vegas entertainment and nightlife scene for more than 15 years. Housley has developed a number of shows over the years including the longest running Comedy Show in Las Vegas.  He's also had a show fail to connect with audiences; which was a strong learning opportunity.  Bring both success and failure experience to the table Housley is uniquely qualified to insure audiences get an amazing show for a reasonable ticket price that also is balanced with a budget to insure longevity.</p>
<p>Cosplay - The Show will remain true to classics, but not be afraid to grow and morph as new classics are made and fan-base increase. We've been careful to develop a show that's accessible to the mainstream while being fun and funny to the bigger geeks in the world. It's also important when developing a parody to both not be too silly and at the same time not take yourself too seriously.  We believe we've struck a balance there and will continue to change and flex the show based on audience feedback.</p>

<h3>About the Creator / Producer</h3>
<p>Pete Housley, creator and producer of Cosplay - The Show, owes much of his love and interest in Science Fiction and Fantasy to his brother Chris Golash who was an avid J.R.R. Tolkien reader and introduced him to Star Trek, Space 1999, Doctor Who and writers like C.S. Lewis, Ray Bradbury and Harlan Ellison.  In 1984, the brothers  attended their first ever Fan Convention together at <i><a href=""https://fanlore.org/wiki/Dixie_Trek"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dixie Trek</a></i> just outside Atlanta, GA which became an annual tradition into their adulthood. It was while attending the 2001 Creation Events Star Trek Convention in Las Vegas that Pete first learned of his brother Chris' untimely death.</p>
<p>""My love of Science Fiction continues today"", said Pete Housley. ""I think I'm most passionate about Doctor Who, both the Classic episodes with Peter Davidson and Tom Baker; as well as the more current David Tenant and Matt Smith years.  But Star Trek is a pretty powerful influence too -- Sisko and Janeway are two of my favorite characters.""</p>
<p>Housley, 48, lives in Las Vegas with his loving partner and mother to their 3 young children; plus their dog (Toshiko) and cats (Captain Jack and Aladdin).</p>
<p>""Movies, television, and books have always offered me both an escape and hope for the future"", continued Pete. ""It started as me wanting a connection with my brother when I was little and has turned into a passion that I hope my children will embrace. The concept of Cosplay - The Show comes from these years of love of the genre and the people I've met along the way.""</p>

<h3>Dance Animal: Toronto</h3>
<p>Dance Animal was founded in Montreal in November 2008 by Robin Henderson.  Inspired by pop culture, pop music, music videos, politics, reality television, fashion, musical theatre, sketch comedy and her own personal travels, <i>Dance Animal:Toronto</i> is Robin’s love-letter to the city of Toronto.  Wanting to reflect the vast spectrum of languages and cultures of her adopted city, Robin deliberately combines the talents of a diverse cast of theatre artists to dynamic results. Our campaign will cover the costs of producing our current Fringe production and raise funds for future shows.</p>

<p>Being rockstar-superheroes takes time and money. Your generous donations will help us to pay for rehearsal space, tights, body suits, tops, leggings, shoes, tights, props and more tights. Have we mentioned how expensive tights are?</p>
<p>To promote our fantastic new show, we hired a photographer for headshots and group shots, a graphic designer for posters, postcards, and programs and a website designer.</p>
<p>Then there's the backstage costs including office supplies, union fees, laundry, transportation, a videographer and staffing costs for our creative and production teams. </p>

</div></div>","Dance Animal: Toronto
Dance Animal was founded in Montreal in November 2008 by Robin Henderson.  Inspired by pop culture, pop music, music videos, politics, reality television, fashion, musical theatre, sketch comedy and her own personal travels, Dance Animal:Toronto is Robin’s love-letter to the city of Toronto.  Wanting to reflect the vast spectrum of languages and cultures of her adopted city, Robin deliberately combines the talents of a diverse cast of theatre artists to dynamic results. Our campaign will cover the costs of producing our current Fringe production and raise funds for future shows.

Break it Down
Being rockstar-superheroes takes time and money. Your generous donations will help us to pay for rehearsal space, tights, body suits, tops, leggings, shoes, tights, props and more tights. Have we mentioned how expensive tights are?
To promote our fantastic new show, we hired a photographer for headshots and group shots, a graphic designer for posters, postcards, and programs and a website designer.
Then there's the backstage costs including office supplies, union fees, laundry, transportation, a videographer and staffing costs for our creative and production teams. 

Sparkle!
Since the premiere of their first (and bilingual) production Dance Animal Presents: Dance Animal, Dance Animal has been smashing box-office records everywhere they perform.  They’ve had record breaking sold-out runs at the Montreal Fringe Festival, the Just For Laughs Festival, Zoofest and the Centaur Theatre’s Wildside Festival.  In 2009 they won the Just For Laughs “Best Comedy” award and were short-listed for the Centaur Theatre  ""Best Production"" award for their first show Dance Animal Presents: Dance Animal.  In 2010 they won the Cirque du Soleil ""Best Original Creation"" award, were given an Honourable Mention for the Studio 303 ""Best Choreography"" award and were nominated for the MECCA award for Best Ensemble for their show Dance Animal Presents : Freaks of Nature.

<p>The McTeggart Irish Dancers
of North Texas have been offering classes in competitive and performance Irish
step dancing in the DFW area since 1984. 
 Our dancers not only compete locally,
regionally, and internationally but they perform throughout the area at schools,
retirement homes, and major cultural events to promote and keep alive the art
of traditional Irish dancing.  Our
dancers truly love this sport for the fun, fitness, and camaraderie it
provides, putting in dozens of hours a month to prepare for competitions.  We offer outstanding instruction to help our
dancers meet their goals and develop a lifelong love of dance!</p>
<p>In
our history of offering classes in the area, we have never had a dance studio
home of our own.  Our classes have been taught
in churches, fire houses, recreation centers, or rented class space from other
dance studios.  As a non-profit school,
we struggled with how we could continue to meet the needs of our new and
existing students with the limits on our space and schedules that comes with
renting from other studios.  We have been
on the lookout for the ideal space for a while now and have recently found a
location that is a great and affordable fit for us.  We are so excited to finally have a dance
space of our very own!</p>
<p>Building
a dance studio has a lot of upfront costs and we are hoping to reach our
fundraising goal of $5,000.  Our list of
basic needs for our new studio include items such as rental deposits, permits,
construction fees, window coverings, flooring, mirrors, and a sound system.  Any extra funds raised beyond this amount would
go towards improving our studio for use over the long term to guarantee the
continued success of our school; things like signage, interior improvements,
workshops, equipment, and choreography.</p>
<p>We
want everyone who chooses to help support our school to know how much we
appreciate them.  We want to thank you by
rewarding our contributors with a variety of perks.  Even if you can't make a large gift, <b>every bit
helps</b>.  Because we are a 501C3 non-profit,
your contributions are also considered a tax-fee donation.</p>
<p>Even
if you can’t contribute, you can still help us by spreading the word about the
McTeggart Irish Dancers of North Texas!

<h3>La Llorona, the Weeping Woman</h3>
<p>Writing Our Legacy is producing a new site-specific theatre production of the Mexican myth La Llorona, in association with Tanglehead Productions.</p>
<p>In our new theatre production, La Llorona is a Mexican woman who is exploited as she tries to follow the American Dream. She leaves behind her children, as so many do, to survive. A timely tale in the current global political climate.</p>
<p>We tell our story with the poetic poetry of the Latin American tradition of dream-like magical realism and surrealism. Our figure meets both real and desert characters on her journey.</p>

<u><strong>NO U-TURNS A. D.</strong></u> Has been accepted to perform in The New York Theatre Festival's <u>WINTERFEST!</u>
</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How did No U-Turns come to be</h3>
<p>I'm Francine Mancini the writer of No U-Turns. I've been singing all my life and at this point that is a long time! I love musical theatre and Rock N Roll.  I've been through my ups and downs like everyone has. When I went through divorce which was probably the most difficult time of my life I turned to my creativity and to friends. Writing songs and spending time with friends led me to forming the story about these women who bond in a particularly difficult time in their lives. When you go through a divorce you are then part of a ""club"". Anyone who is divorced bonds with you therefore I've heard many stories of divorce which helped me to write this piece.  Strong, vulnerable sometimes broken women who get through it  when the dreams they had were shattered. They pick themselves up and go on. I wanted to tell that story through songs and that is  what became NO U-Turns A. D.</p>
<h2><strong>History</strong></h2>
<p>After 10 years of writing and developing we did a cabaret production  in 2013 which was well received but unable to continue financially. We now have been accepted to the New York Theatre Festival giving us the opportunity to bring it into a theatre and continue developing. This is a very exciting opportunity! this is another step in the journey to creating a show that we are hoping could have a longer run in a theatre. </p>
<p>But we cannot do it alone, we need your help! To put together the best show we can we need supporters like you. We need to pay our cast, our musicians,  our staff ,  there's rehearsal space to rent and advertising. Unfortunately this takes funds which we do not have. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>We need YOUR SUPPORT!!</h3>
<h3>You can be part of an exciting new show that tells women's stories!</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ideally we would raise $20, 000 which would cover salaries, rehearsals, advertising, costumes, props and sets. </li>
<li>For your support Check out our perks!!</li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal the show will go on but we will have a bare bones production, we will have to pay the cast and musicians a pittance. We will have no advertising to boost the show and our audience which is necessary to help the show continue and grow. This all compromises the quality and the ability to continue. </li>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are a growing group of artists in our second year of production, passionate about asking life's big questions and engaging in meaningful dialogue with the community.  Last year, our production of<i> Freud's Last Session </i>won the 2016 Hawaii State Theatre Council <i>Po‘okela Awards</i> for Outstanding Overall Production, Outstanding Director, and Outstanding Guest Artist.  This year, we are excited  to bring you <i>The Last Days of Judas Iscariot</i>.</p>
<h3>What's the Story?</h3>
<p>Set in a time-bending, seriocomic world between heaven and hell, <i>The Last Days of Judas Iscariot</i> is a meditation on the conflict between divine mercy and human free will that takes a close look at the eternal damnation of Judas Iscariot – the Bible's most notorious sinner.</p>
<p>Presented as a taut and riotous courtroom drama in the depths of Purgatory, <i>Judas</i> features a wild cast of characters – Mother Teresa, Pontius Pilate, Sigmund Freud, even Satan himself – to ask the question, “What happened to Judas Iscariot?”</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need </strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>The total amount that we are looking to raise is <strong>$25,000</strong>.  Some of that need has already been met by those who are committed members of our team.  However, we still have a long way to go. Specifically, <strong>our largest need is making sure we have the professional acting talent to fill 15 roles</strong>.  Our total budget for actor expenses (including wages, travel, and lodging) comes to <strong>$16,000</strong>.  Right now, we would like to focus on raising at least <strong>$15,000 before May 1st</strong>, but we are hoping to see our full $16,000 if not even the full $25,000!</p>
<p>To show our appreciation of your generosity, we will be offering some great perks, including: free beverages at concessions, a book about the original Off-Broadway production, complimentary tickets, a sneak peak of a dress rehearsal, and even an invitation to our gala celebration.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Some of the risks that we face stem from the fact that this is a much larger production than what we attempted and accomplished last year.  We are coming upon a quick deadline to raise all of our funds.  As with <i>Freud, </i>we hope to fly in some of our professional talent from the mainland, which means we need to know if we can pay for their expenses far enough in advance to allow them to clear their calendars to commit to a production so far away from home.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are also looking for people who might be able to volunteer their time during the production process itself.  We will need ushers and front of house staff.  We will need extra hands to get our space ready for the show.  We would absolutely love people to bring us food!  They don't call us ""starving artists"" just for fun. </p>

<p>We need your help to make something really special happen! <font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are asking for your support to help us take our critically </span>acclaimed dance<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> theatre production, Within This Dust to the 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum at the World Trade Center in New York City.  </span></font></p>
<p>But who are we? Well, we are a charity based in Dundee, Scotland and we present the critically acclaimed work of Thomas Small, our multi award winning choreographer and the first ever Artist in Residence at BBC Radio 2.  We tour dance productions to theatres and interesting spaces around the world.  We also deliver creative learning workshops in partnership with brilliant partners such as NHS Tayside where we deliver a smoking awareness project called Well Good in 116 primary schools in Scotland; a project in care homes working with people living with dementia and Alzheimer's; and an upcoming project bring young and old LGBT people together to creatively talk about the process of coming out 50 years apart.   </p>
<p>We regard art as a powerful agent for change in the world. </p>
<p>Within This Dust explores the events surrounding 9/11 and is inspired by the iconic series of photographs by Richard Drew that capture a man falling from the World Trade Center during the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>Within This Dust balances sumptuous movement and subtle storytelling to explore themes of impact, loss, survival and humanity in relation to the stark horror of the day.  The work is performed within a backdrop of 2,977 pieces of white paper that symbolize the lives lost that day and serves as a dynamic, ever-changing landscape to evoke the memories from and since the day.  Within This Dust combines beautiful filmic moments and striking physicality. The show was part of the 2012 Made in Scotland Showcase enjoying a sold-out run of performances at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and featured on the BBC Culture Show.  Within This Dust has toured internationally to New York City, Sao Paulo &amp; Berlin, and received 4 stars from The Scotsman saying ‘<i>So beautiful, I had tears pouring down my face’.</i></p>
<p>We are delighted to have been invited to present the work at the 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum at the World Trade Center on 21st April.  We are over the moon to have been given this amazing opportunity to share the work at such an important site.  We are asking you for some support to take the show on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to present the work at this important museum.  You can read more about the show <a href=""https://www.911memorial.org/exhibitions/within-dust"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> on the museum's website.</p>
<p>The show features 2,977 pieces of paper and we are asking you to sponsor and help us take one piece of paper to NYC.  We’d love you to feature in the show by telling us about your memories of 9/11.  Your accounts will feature in the pre-show exhibition. </p>
<p>You can sponsor as many pieces of paper as you wish and we will acknowledge your support on the official programme for the performance and also on our website to say Thank You, and recognise that you have played an important part in helping us stage this piece of work at the museum.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To take the show to NYC, we need £2500 to cover the costs of bringing the dancers together in Dundee to rehearse and prepare for this unique performance.  We have applied for funding from Creative Scotland, our national arts council, to help us cover the costs of flights and accommodation and fees for the cast and crew. Our charity's own very limited funds will be used to contribute towards these costs.  However, even with this support, we still need to fundraise to cover the costs of rehearsing and preparing for the show.  Here are a breakdown of the costs:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490381970/ubwtkad5lqi8fxhbbwfv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>£1000 - Rehearsal studio venue hire in Dundee</p>
<p>£900 - Fees for the 2 dancers for the rehearsal week (each dancer earning £450 for the week)</p>
<p>£350 - Travel costs to bring dancers to Dundee for the rehearsals (one lives in Belgium and the other in Glasgow)</p>
<p>£250 - Accommodation costs for 2 dancers for the rehearsal week</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In return for your generosity, we can offer some unique perks! Have a look and see what you fancy!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal then funds raised will be used to cover the fees for the dancers and we will source alternative ways to host the dancers and rehearse.   If we raise more than we anticipate then we will produce a short film that documents our NYC trip and including interviews with the creative team and those affected by the attacks.  The aim of this new filmic work would be to capture people’s evolutionary perceptions of the issues regarding terrorism since the 9/11 attacks. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a dance company that regularly engages in issue-based productions and inclusive Creative Learning work, we strongly believe that our work is socially committed and worth of a shared experience through watching shows, participation, consultation and co-creation. The piece that we are presenting at the 9/11 Museum and memorial is based on the 9/11 attacks, with terrorism being an issue that unfortunately is not disappearing form the International Politics agendas.</p>
<p>We think that artists have a duty to present work that acts as a catalyst for shared discussions, reflections and debates at grass-roots levels. </p>
<p>All the people contributing in this campaign will help to support a new film that incorporates new thinking, new reflections, new questions, and perhaps new solutions for the times ahead. <br/>As societies develop, and we deal with vertiginous changes and adaptations, artists have the wonderful duty to reflect and comment on present affairs as well as imagining new ways of existence, supported not necessarily by institutions but by individuals that likewise, believe in art as a human right and its powerful transformational force. </p>
<p>The show has already built a successful track record through performances at venues internationally in Sao Paulo, NYC and Berlin; and received critical acclaim (4 star reviews) from major newspapers such as The Herald and The Scotsman.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As a small charity, we are fully aware of the current economic climate and are therefore diversifying income streams by resorting to micro-funding campaigns. We acknowledge the power of movements and are appealing to individuals who, like us, feel strongly about supporting causes with a social impact, in this case, through art. </p>
<p>We understand that part of the challenges regarding this campaign could be that a section of the public may get upset, as this is a sensitive issues with regards to different aspects. </p>
<p>In addition, as the financial situation seems to be a strain for most people, we accept that this may not be a highly participatory campaign. </p>
<p>We do, however, as artists, feel strongly about the need to collaborate in cultural, cross-borders, supportive artistic movements that have social change at their heart, and so with this campaign are humbly appealing to like-minded individuals. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Steve Coker, I been writing since 1987 where I began writing children’s plays for Clark College’s Touring Children’s Theatre. In 1991 I decided to write my first full-length stage play, “Looking for Olivia.” “Olivia” got a lot of attention in Europe where it was entered into the Swansea Bay Film Festival as a screenplay by mistake. </p>
<p>""Looking for Olivia” heralds the arrival of the next generation of American writers in the tradition of Neil Simon and Woody Allen. Steve Coker is seriously good. I look forward enormously to his future works."" -Binda Singh  Swansea Bay Film Festival.</p>
<p>I quickly realized I was more of a screenwriter than playwright and began to focus my attention on writing for film. Several of my screenplays were locally produced; “Crackin’ The Code,” “Thomas and theTrain Master,” (both currently available on Vimeo) and the upcoming features, “Giant Killers,” and “Hello, I Love You!”  But now, several years later I have return to my first love, Theatre... and have now adapted two of my film scripts into successful stage plays; “Varsity Cheerleader Werewolves From Outer Space,” and “The Adventures of Dex Dixon: Paranormal Dick” which I adapted with my composer KJ McElrath and Arranger Pete Petersen.  The show played to audiences in Portland to stunning review and “Dex Dixon” has had it’s world premier as a brand new main-stage musical production with Stumptown Stages as part of the 2016 Fertile Ground Ne Works Festival in January 2016  and was nominated for several PAMTAs(Portland Area Musical Theatre Awards;)  including; Best Original Musical, Best Original Orchestration, and Best Original Song :""You Pull My Strings"" </p>
<p>We were lucky enough to receive the award for Best Original Song and this has refueled my interest in creating an original cast album. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are currently looking to raise $8500.00 to record the original musical with a 16 piece orchestra and some of the amazing singers from the World Premier Production. </p>
<p>The money will be used to rent a recording studio, hire an engineer, musicians and pay a small stipend to the performers.  Any additional funds will be used to produce the art and packaging and to post to online distribution sources. </p>
<p>To those generous enough to donate to our cause, you will receive some cool Dex Dixon prizes and merchandise; from Posters, and original character design art pieces, to the soundtrack CD or digital tracks themselves.  And you will be part of making our show visible (audible) across the country.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Once we have the recording, we will be able to market the show in a much more professional and focused way... reaching out to regional theaters and seeking production partners.  We will gain grass roots fans that can help promote the music and a desire for actual full stage productions.  We will be able to approach publishing houses so that the show can be made available for theatre companies to produce and perform the show nationwide. </p>
<p>Here are some of the amazing things said about our show (full reviews available upon request or through google search;)</p>
<p>“A dizzily entertaining new musical!”      “One of Fertile Ground’s most captivating shows.”</p>
<p>“Dex Dixon… is predicated on delicious pulp-poetry and puns.”</p>
<p>“I seem to always come to the same conclusion about shows I love:  It comes down to IQ and this is one of the smartest teams I’ve seen in a long time.”</p>
<p>""Dex Dixon: Paranormal Dick"" is doubtlessly the most bizarre show currently running on a Portland stage.”</p>
<p>“(possessing the) nuance, technical sophistication and unvarnished authenticity we've come to expect from Steve Coker.”</p>
<p>“…a creative vision, forged by immersion in the excesses of schlock culture, that honors the workaday artists who fueled show business well before the monsters took over.”</p>
<p>“…silliness moving at maximum flow, with enough comic pauses to let the puns and double-entendres sink in. You laugh. You groan. But you respond. Loudly.”</p>
<p>“…imaginative and impressive.”</p>
<p>“The monsters and the music make this Portland-grown parody anything but ""Grimm.""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that money can be tight and you may not be able to contribute right now... But if you could share this with your friends and family or people in your circle of influence who are supporters of the arts, that would be a wonderful help to us.  And be sure to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>Thanks and see you at the show!!!</p>

We were lucky enough to receive the award for Best Original Song and this has refueled my interest in creating an original cast album. 

What We Need & What You Get
We are currently looking to raise $8500.00 to record the original musical with a 16 piece orchestra and some of the amazing singers from the World Premier Production. 
The money will be used to rent a recording studio, hire an engineer, musicians and pay a small stipend to the performers.  Any additional funds will be used to produce the art and packaging and to post to online distribution sources. 
To those generous enough to donate to our cause, you will receive some cool Dex Dixon prizes and merchandise; from Posters, and original character design art pieces, to the soundtrack CD or digital tracks themselves.  And you will be part of making our show visible (audible) across the country.

The Impact
Once we have the recording, we will be able to market the show in a much more professional and focused way... reaching out to regional theaters and seeking production partners.  We will gain grass roots fans that can help promote the music and a desire for actual full stage productions.  We will be able to approach publishing houses so that the show can be made available for theatre companies to produce and perform the show nationwide. 
Here are some of the amazing things said about our show (full reviews available upon request or through google search;)
“A dizzily entertaining new musical!”      “One of Fertile Ground’s most captivating shows.”
“Dex Dixon… is predicated on delicious pulp-poetry and puns.”
“I seem to always come to the same conclusion about shows I love:  It comes down to IQ and this is one of the smartest teams I’ve seen in a long time.”
""Dex Dixon: Paranormal Dick"" is doubtlessly the most bizarre show currently running on a Portland stage.”
“(possessing the) nuance, technical sophistication and unvarnished authenticity we've come to expect from Steve Coker.”
“…a creative vision, forged by immersion in the excesses of schlock culture, that honors the workaday artists who fueled show business well before the monsters took over.”
“…silliness moving at maximum flow, with enough comic pauses to let the puns and double-entendres sink in. You laugh. You groan. But you respond. Loudly.”
“…imaginative and impressive.”
“The monsters and the music make this Portland-grown parody anything but ""Grimm.""

Other Ways You Can Help
I understand that money can be tight and you may not be able to contribute right now... But if you could share this with your friends and family or people in your circle of influence who are supporters of the arts, that would be a wonderful help to us.  And be sure to use the Indiegogo share tools!

<p><strong>“He has the power to make anyone’s dreams come true… except his own.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>Monroe Stahr, the “Boy Wonder” is a man obsessed: with movies, with illusion, with the memory of his dead wife and with Shakespeare. When an earthquake nearly destroys the studio, an enigmatic and mysterious Englishwoman steps out of the wreckage.</strong></p>

</div></div>","play collaborative arts opened its doors in 2014, collaborating with hundreds of artists and welcoming thousands of audience members into our uniquely creative world.  After two amazing years of programming, VICE (yes the police! not the subversive media outlet!) shut down performance at play. Fair enough, we were hosting tons of awesome underground art events.  We didn't ask for permission, took some risks and committed to creating and hosting dynamic experiences across those two years. We knew one day the money guys or the authority guys would show up and tell us to ""comply."" Although we've found that going legit can be expensive, bureaucratic and confusing, we are excited about what this process means for our community. After months of meeting with public officials, permitting and building code experts, we have an iron-clad plan for legitimizing play.  We've received an amazing amount of support from our local community in the arts district.  Local contractors, architects, sister art spaces and the Arts District Cultural Council are on our side and have all lent a hand in getting us to where we are today.  Legitimizing play will give us the freedom to elevate the programming we curate, create, and host.  We are thankful for the space we've been able to hold for artists as an underground venue, but we're even more excited to be able to shout ""play!"" from the rooftops.  WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?legitimizing our performing arts
$15,000: building plans, permitting for cafe, & live entertainment license

$30,000: beer & wine permit

$40,000-$60,000: construction of cafe & ADA bathrooms

$5,000-$10,000: other fees (indiegogo's 5%, etc.)



Each one of the major arcana has their own special abilities ranging from a shout out on social media to a lifetime of unlimited access for you and a friend. Choose which unique experience is for you. The Heiro, Sun, and Empire cards unlock special, immersive experiences that we're creating with you in mind.  These cardholders will receive access to the inner workings of play.  Each card includes it's own bounty of perks, which one will you choose?

I have been working in theatre professionally since 1999, with youth in theatre since 1995 &amp; the theatre bug bit me in 1990. After moving to Chicago in 2002 with the goal of opening my own theatre I had to take jobs teaching theatre and improv to middle schoolers in after school settings, residencies and at Summer camps to make ends meet. All the while continuing to learn. After only 3 years of teaching for one camp I took it over as its director. I did start a very successful, one of a kind teen improv ensemble ""Underage Sugar Addicts"" as a result.

I have been working in theatre professionally since 1999, with youth in theatre since 1995 & the theatre bug bit me in 1990. After moving to Chicago in 2002 with the goal of opening my own theatre I had to take jobs teaching theatre and improv to middle schoolers in after school settings, residencies and at Summer camps to make ends meet. All the while continuing to learn. After only 3 years of teaching for one camp I took it over as its director. I did start a very successful, one of a kind teen improv ensemble ""Underage Sugar Addicts"" as a result. In 2011 I left that position to create the education department for the Piccolo Theatre and be its Education Director. Just this past January the perfect storm happened that led to me leave that position and take over a theatre space and finally begin Theatre Above the Law.

<h3>What we are doing</h3>
<p>The festival exists because people want it to exist. We're a, friendly, slightly unruly bunch who work really hard (mostly on goodwill) to make it happen and welcome every single person who passes our way into our world.</p>
<p>We know that puppetry is an artform that should be for everyone - and we're committed to that journey. The fifth Bristol Festival of Puppetry is happening 1 - 10 September 2017 across Watershed and Tobacco Factory Theatres, and is packed with shows, films, parades, workshops and talks. Our small team of volunteers and crew are going to make it the best one yet, but we just need a financial boost to get us where we want to be so that we can set our beliefs in motion.</p>
<p>We’re so excited about the festival and our future, and are overjoyed that you might help us get there. We’re very grateful for every penny and thank every single person who donates or shares this campaign  - because we’re all about people getting together and making beautiful and great things happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This year, we’re focusing on expanding our audiences and creating new opportunities for them. We want accessibility and diversity to be part of our DNA, and we're committing to that right here, right now offering signed and relaxed performances at this year’s festival and setting up Interchange - 3 days of panel discussions and labs exploring how puppetry can offer diverse people platforms to tell their stories and how diverse practitioners can help us to develop puppetry. Your money will make the festival and Interchange as big as possible and  help create a legacy of accessibility and inclusion for the future.</p>
<p>We’ve got some amazing perks on offer for you generous people. All exclusive and all strictly limited.</p>
<ul>
<li>Peter Lord, signed, one off drawing. - SUPER EXCLUSIVE AND VERY RARE</li>
<li>Group tours of Puppet Place</li>
<li>Festival Pass - super cheap for those that want to see as many shows as possible.</li>
<li>Festival Family Passes - flexible family passes for all our shows</li>
<li>Stop Motion Workshop - ONE OFF</li>
<li>Become a puppet  - ONLY TWO AVAILABLE</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve got some very exclusive rewards and amazing festival perks - or you can always just donate a few pounds to the cause, because like us, you simply believe that puppets make the world that little bit better.</p>
<p>The more we raise, the better  Interchange and the festival will be, if we don’t hit our target then Interchange will still happen, albeit at a smaller scale.  Your support will help us make all of our dreams for Interchange, Puppet Place and the festival into a reality. No matter what we raise, we’ll be able to go bigger than we would without your generous support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The festival is largely funded through a Grants for the Arts bid to Arts Council England and we need your support to help us take our plans to the next level. This year's festival has a specific focus on Diversity and Puppetry and accordingly, we are writing to ask for support towards the important work we are doing to widen participation in puppetry among all our communities. This year's diversity-focused events fall within Interchange; a three-day long mini-festival in which we will work alongside leading organisations (Diverse City, Doing Things Differently, Bristol Physical Access Chain, etc) and other individuals who work with disadvantaged people across Bristol and further afield.</p>
<p>To ensure that any legacy from this work is carried into future Puppet Place activity and especially the next festivals in 2019 and beyond, we have created a Diversity Focus Group, comprising learning disabled and non-learning disabled professionals, health care workers and specialists, who will document and evaluate all  Interchange activity. Their findings will help Puppet Place to ensure the legacy of Interchange and its new partnerships, and to identify and articulate a Call to Action towards implementing real change in our sector.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Puppet Place is a registered charity and has been a UK hub for puppetry and animation since 1984. We have a professional and experienced team behind the festival. The risks here are low, the challenges are the ones we face in increasingly competitive environment for public funding. We've partnered with key disability and community groups to ensure that we can achieve realistic and long lasting connections with the people we're setting out to engage.</p>
<p>This is the 5th edition of the Bristol Festival of Puppetry and your investment will help us to take our work to new communities and improve accessibility across the festival. Your money will help us capitalise on years of reputation and trust building.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, you can still help. Tweet, facebook, instagram, tell you friends.

In this serio-comic look at love and letting go, an epic snowstorm shuts the city down. With no way to get home, Ian shows up at his ex-girlfriend’s door looking for a place to crash and a chance to revive their relationship. With the weather forcing them together, Ian and Lacey rehash the past. And though it’s clear they love each other, they are unable to find any shelter in each other – for them the storm outside reflects their love; beautiful and oh so destructive.</p><p></p><p>At the helm as director, Lori Kee returns to Planet Connections following her 2014 win for Outstanding Director for her work on ""Vacation! All I Ever Wanted"".  Lori has also won best directing awards for her work on ""Death, it Happens…""  (2012 Frigid Festival) and ""Male Man""  (Medicine Show.) At the 2013 Planet Connections Gala event ""One Acts for A Cause"", she directed ""Tennesee by"" John Patrick Shanley. She is Resident Director at Nylon Fusion Theatre Company and teaches acting at BMCC CUNY. Find out more about Lori: <a href=""http://www.lorikee.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.lorikee.com/</a><br/></p><p></p><p>Playwright, Melissa Skirboll is excited to be taking on the role of Lacey in this production. This is Melissa's fourth time participating with Planet Connections. She won Outstanding Direction for her work on Amy Gray Piper's  ""The Closet"" in 2012, Acted in her play ""Hell is Where the Heart Is"" in 2011 (both produced with her company LifeDream Productions,) and directed Mark Jason WIlliam's ""Straight Faced Lies"" in 2013.</p><p></p><p>The role of Ian will be played by the very funny, sexy, and talented GARY LEE MAHMOUD! Gary has had the pleasure of playing a principal role in <em>The Bourne Legacy</em> and was a series regular on the Nicktoons live action show <em>Alien Dawn</em>.
 Amongst his more noteworthy roles, he has hosted the Onion News 
Network’s mock debate show “In The Know,” appeared as the featured 
dancing businessman in the Saturday Night Live music video “Boombox,” 
and had the privilege of performing in a staged reading of the 
screenplay ""Mona’s Dream"" with Oscar nominee Shoreh Aghdashloo. He is 
proudest of writing, producing, and performing in his multi-million view
 web sensation ""Panhandler's Party"".  Check him out at: <a href=""http://www.serfgary.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.serfgary.com/</a><br/></p><p></p><p>Steven Albano returns to LifeDream Productions and Planet connections as Stage Manager. So happy to be working with him again -- he was my right hand on The Closet and having him involved allows me to breathe easy knowing that everything will be handled expertly!</p><p>Andy Evan Cohen has joined the team as Sound Designer. Andy is a multi-talented, composer, musician, sound designer, music director and all around boon to the production team. His theatrical compositions have been performed in numerous venues in 
New York City and in the Northeastern U.S. region. His works have been 
played in such venues as Lincoln Center, Fordham University, The Public 
Theater, off-Broadway at Theatre Row, 59E59, La Mama, HERE, the Ohio 
Theatre, Theater for the New City, Expanded Arts, and the New York 
International Fringe Festival, where he was a 2000 ""Excellence"" Award 
Winner. More about Andy here: <a href=""http://www.andycomusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.andycomusic.com/</a><br/></p><p></p><p>Funds raised will cover the basic expenses of putting on this show:</p><p></p><p>Stipends: Director, Actor, Stage Manager and sound designer will be receiving stipends. If donations exceed budget; they get paid more. (And they are worth it! Anyone involved in a festival is not doing this to get rich - the stipends cover transportation and not much more. It would be great to be able to give each of these people more than a token of my appreciation!)</p><p></p><p>Rehearsal Space: This tends to be the biggest expense for these types of productions. A good rule of thumb when budgeting rehearsal time is 1 hour per page. Blizzard is 30 pages - which means about 30 hours of rehearsal. There are some discounts and special rates available to Festivity participants, but it still will likely average a minimum of $20/hour. That's $600 if we are able to keep to the minimum. Because this is a one act and we are playing in conjunction with two other pieces, we are also budgeting in some shared rehearsals so that we can smooth out the scene changes and running order so that the audience will see a show that runs seamlessly from start to finish. Being conservative and allowing for some extra time I'm budgeting $800 to rehearsal space.</p><p></p><p>Audition space: Same pricing structure as rehearsal space. Since we are only auditioning for one role we think we can do this in 4-6 hours total. Budget: $100-150</p><p></p><p>Marketing/Postcards/Posters/Etc: $200</p><p></p><p>Props/Set/Wardrobe: $250</p><p>Planet Connections Theatre Festivity is a GREEN theater festival, we will be sharing set pieces when possible, scavenging, borrowing and seeking out used things whenever possible. </p><p></p><p>Fees/Insurance/etc. Submission fee: $25, Entrance Fee $250 (Split with the two other one-acts that are sharing the bill; so $81.33) And depending on whether the actor we cast as Ian is Equity or not, supplemental insurance policy may be required (around $150.) Budget: $100-$250.</p><p></p><p>Other expenses</p><p></p><p>I'm hoping that I can bring out my inner Scrooge and find ways to pinch the pennies till they bleed - so hopefully there will  be some wiggle room in this budget. However, There are probably a few things that will need to come out of pocket. budget: $0 up to $200.</p><p></p><p>Oh yes - that all adds up to more than $1800. So don't stop just because you think we raised what we need! I'm low-balling because I'm hoping to find some creative ways to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>You may remember from past years that Part of the commitment to Planet Connections is to choose a charity and help raise funds and awareness. This Year we are working with Planned Parenthood. </p><p></p><p><a href=""http://www.plannedparenthood.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.plannedparenthood.org</a></p><p></p><p>For nearly 100 years, Planned Parenthood has promoted a commonsense approach to women’s health and well-being, based on respect for each individual’s right to make informed, independent decisions about health, sex, and family planning. </p><p></p><p>Part of the ticket sales will be going to this worthy cause and we will be asking for donations at the theater to go towards WIN as well. However, if this fundraising campaign becomes WILDLY successful, we will be adding the excess to the pot.</p><p></p><p>Other Ways You Can Help</p><p></p><p>Even if you can't contribute right now you can help make this show a success.

In this serio-comic look at love and letting go, an epic snowstorm shuts the city down. With no way to get home, Ian shows up at his ex-girlfriend’s door looking for a place to crash and a chance to revive their relationship. With the weather forcing them together, Ian and Lacey rehash the past. And though it’s clear they love each other, they are unable to find any shelter in each other – for them the storm outside reflects their love; beautiful and oh so destructive.At the helm as director, Lori Kee returns to Planet Connections following her 2014 win for Outstanding Director for her work on ""Vacation! All I Ever Wanted"".  Lori has also won best directing awards for her work on ""Death, it Happens…""  (2012 Frigid Festival) and ""Male Man""  (Medicine Show.) At the 2013 Planet Connections Gala event ""One Acts for A Cause"", she directed ""Tennesee by"" John Patrick Shanley. She is Resident Director at Nylon Fusion Theatre Company and teaches acting at BMCC CUNY. Find out more about Lori: http://www.lorikee.com/Playwright, Melissa Skirboll is excited to be taking on the role of Lacey in this production. This is Melissa's fourth time participating with Planet Connections. She won Outstanding Direction for her work on Amy Gray Piper's  ""The Closet"" in 2012, Acted in her play ""Hell is Where the Heart Is"" in 2011 (both produced with her company LifeDream Productions,) and directed Mark Jason WIlliam's ""Straight Faced Lies"" in 2013.The role of Ian will be played by the very funny, sexy, and talented GARY LEE MAHMOUD! Gary has had the pleasure of playing a principal role in The Bourne Legacy and was a series regular on the Nicktoons live action show Alien Dawn.
 Amongst his more noteworthy roles, he has hosted the Onion News 
Network’s mock debate show “In The Know,” appeared as the featured 
dancing businessman in the Saturday Night Live music video “Boombox,” 
and had the privilege of performing in a staged reading of the 
screenplay ""Mona’s Dream"" with Oscar nominee Shoreh Aghdashloo. He is 
proudest of writing, producing, and performing in his multi-million view
 web sensation ""Panhandler's Party"".  Check him out at: www.serfgary.com/Steven Albano returns to LifeDream Productions and Planet connections as Stage Manager. So happy to be working with him again -- he was my right hand on The Closet and having him involved allows me to breathe easy knowing that everything will be handled expertly!Andy Evan Cohen has joined the team as Sound Designer. Andy is a multi-talented, composer, musician, sound designer, music director and all around boon to the production team. His theatrical compositions have been performed in numerous venues in 
New York City and in the Northeastern U.S. region. His works have been 
played in such venues as Lincoln Center, Fordham University, The Public 
Theater, off-Broadway at Theatre Row, 59E59, La Mama, HERE, the Ohio 
Theatre, Theater for the New City, Expanded Arts, and the New York 
International Fringe Festival, where he was a 2000 ""Excellence"" Award 
Winner. More about Andy here: http://www.andycomusic.com/Funds raised will cover the basic expenses of putting on this show:Stipends: Director, Actor, Stage Manager and sound designer will be receiving stipends. If donations exceed budget; they get paid more. (And they are worth it! Anyone involved in a festival is not doing this to get rich - the stipends cover transportation and not much more. It would be great to be able to give each of these people more than a token of my appreciation!)Rehearsal Space: This tends to be the biggest expense for these types of productions. A good rule of thumb when budgeting rehearsal time is 1 hour per page. Blizzard is 30 pages - which means about 30 hours of rehearsal. There are some discounts and special rates available to Festivity participants, but it still will likely average a minimum of $20/hour. That's $600 if we are able to keep to the minimum. Because this is a one act and we are playing in conjunction with two other pieces, we are also budgeting in some shared rehearsals so that we can smooth out the scene changes and running order so that the audience will see a show that runs seamlessly from start to finish. Being conservative and allowing for some extra time I'm budgeting $800 to rehearsal space.Audition space: Same pricing structure as rehearsal space. Since we are only auditioning for one role we think we can do this in 4-6 hours total. Budget: $100-150Marketing/Postcards/Posters/Etc: $200Props/Set/Wardrobe: $250Planet Connections Theatre Festivity is a GREEN theater festival, we will be sharing set pieces when possible, scavenging, borrowing and seeking out used things whenever possible. Fees/Insurance/etc. Submission fee: $25, Entrance Fee $250 (Split with the two other one-acts that are sharing the bill; so $81.33) And depending on whether the actor we cast as Ian is Equity or not, supplemental insurance policy may be required (around $150.) Budget: $100-$250.Other expensesI'm hoping that I can bring out my inner Scrooge and find ways to pinch the pennies till they bleed - so hopefully there will  be some wiggle room in this budget. However, There are probably a few things that will need to come out of pocket. budget: $0 up to $200.Oh yes - that all adds up to more than $1800. So don't stop just because you think we raised what we need! I'm low-balling because I'm hoping to find some creative ways to make ends meet.You may remember from past years that Part of the commitment to Planet Connections is to choose a charity and help raise funds and awareness. This Year we are working with Planned Parenthood. www.plannedparenthood.orgFor nearly 100 years, Planned Parenthood has promoted a commonsense approach to women’s health and well-being, based on respect for each individual’s right to make informed, independent decisions about health, sex, and family planning. Part of the ticket sales will be going to this worthy cause and we will be asking for donations at the theater to go towards WIN as well. However, if this fundraising campaign becomes WILDLY successful, we will be adding the excess to the pot.Other Ways You Can HelpEven if you can't contribute right now you can help make this show a success.

<p><i>How expensive can putting on a play really be?</i></p>
<p>Well, we have a lot of people to pay. There's royalty fees to give to the publishing company, rent costumes, buy props, build a set, and rent a space. It's not all caviar and lavish hotels. As a matter of fact, what does caviar taste like? I'm curious.</p>

Reagan worked under Kurt Tofteland on a production of <i>As You Like It </i>and assistant directed under R. Scott Lank in UE's fall 2014 production of <i>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</i>.</li>
<li>
<b>Oshane Smith</b> will be playing the role of Adam. A comedic actor that graduated from Newman Smith High School in 2012, Oshane hopes to use this performance as a chance to hone his comedic skills and become the next Wayne Brady...

<li>
<b>Daniel Magden </b>will be playing the role of Jess. Having recently graduated from Billy Ryan High School, Dan hopes to earn credit hours at NCTC and transfer elsewhere to major in film production. Daniel's short film, <i>Tick Tick Boom </i> placed 18th in state competition this year: he directed and wrote the show himself, along with three other shorts, during his time at Billy Ryan. The show would help him put experience under his belt and get into a decent film school.</li>
<li>
<b>Jason Julian Perez </b>will be playing the role of Daniel. A 2014 graduate from Newman Smith High School, Jason is currently attending Brookhaven College and majoring in Theatre. Jason hopes to use this performance to further hone his acting skills, and is the perfect third member of our production.

<p><b>JP
Dance Group's Dance The World Nutcracker Festival is a curated world dance
festival within a Jazz Nutcracker. This unique adaptation of the holiday
classic aims to expose and educate the audience about all different kinds of
cultural dance and world music, promote fair business practice and diversity in
dance, and celebrate the unique cultures that all call New York City home.</b></p>
<p><b>SHOW
SYNOPISIS</b></p>
<p>Set
to Duke Ellington's jazz arrangement of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker suite, Act 1
opens on a hoppin' holiday party in a Harlem Brownstone at the height of the
roaring 20's. At the party, Clara receives a nutcracker doll from her
mysterious uncle Dross L. Myer. Little does she know that the Nutcracker has a
magical spell cast upon it. Later that night the Nutcracker tethers a magical
snowstorm that carries Clara on a magical adventure to the 1922 World's Fair in
Rio De Janiero.</p>
<p>In
Act 2, the world's fair,
guest performances by New York City's top cultural dance companies bring 
traditional dance and music of their cultures to the stage.</p>
<p><b>HISTORY
OF THE PRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>Dance
the World Nutcracker Festival is now three years in the making. It began as
1/2hour show for school children (then titled Nutcracker on Lenox Ave)
that  was commissioned by Riverbank State Park in Harlem in 2013. 
Petrusak decided to rework
The Nutcracker in order to pay homage to rich artistic history of Harlem, and
to create a platform on which to teach the children about all types of dance;
jazz, tap, modern, and a variety of cultural dances.  Wanting to expose
the children to authentic cultural dance and traditional world music rather
than ballet inspired by cultures, Petrusak decided not to choreograph the second act
herself. Instead she turned to her very diverse company of dancers to perform
traditional dances from their countries such as Taiwanese fan dance, Brazilian
Samba, and Dunyavi Roma (world Gypsy).</p>
<p>The show a success and
was invited back to Riverbank for a second year and additional performances for
the general public. In two years of presenting at Riverbank, the show has
reached over 5,000 school children, senior citizens, and families.</p>
<p>Now,
in its third year, Petrusak is premiering the performance as she originally
envisioned it; an evening length production with a world dance festival
embedded into the 2nd act. The first act and supporting roles in the second act
are choreographed by Petrusak and will be danced by JP Dance Group. The second act will feature the festival of professional cultural dance groups.</p>
<p><b>This
Production and Fair Business Practice in the Arts</b></p>
<p>JP
Dance Group advocates fair business practice and will implement fair business
practice in the production Dance the World Nutcracker Festival. This means
that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Box
     office proceeds will be split fairly with all participating artists</li>
<li>No
     application fee will be charged to applying guest artists</li>
<li>All
     applications will be granted fair reviewed by a panel of dance
     professionals</li>
<li>All
     technical professionals (lighting designers, videographers, photographers,
     etc..)will be compensated</li>
<li>The
     festival will be professionally promoted in an effort to gain worthwhile
     exposure (i.e. potential presenters, new audiences, press reviews) for all
     artists involved</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What the show needs:</b></p>
<ul>
<p><b>Dancers.</b> Dancers will be compensated fairly each nigh they perform.
JP Dance Group advocates fair pay in dance.</p>
<p><b>Technical
staff</b>. A professional lighting designer,
stage manager, videographer, and photographer will be hired for the production</p>
<p><b>Marketing</b>. The show will be marketed to the general public, the press, and local organizations. We need help in spreading the world and creating professional marketing materials<br/></p>
<p><b>Programs.</b> The programs will not just outline the Production, but will
also provide background information on the participating guest artists, the
cultural significance of the dances they are performing. This extra information
is expensive but will deeply enhance the audiences experience and appreciation
of what they are viewing.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</ul>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Supporting this production will help expose audiences to all different kinds of traditional world dance, promote cultural understanding, and celebrate diversity in dance.<br/></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Part of JP Dance Group's mission is to provide affordable
access to the arts and thus we are keeping tickets under $30 and are offering
student and senior discounts. However, this also means that our projected costs
of the production out-weigh the projected box office proceeds<b>.  </b>We are seeking the help of individual donors, sponsorships, and grants to help make this
production the best it can possibly be.</p>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The proceeds of this campaign are  specifically earmarked to provide fair 
compensation for our hardworking dancers and technical staff. If you 
would like to sponsor another need of the show, visit our direct

Dance Group's Dance The World Nutcracker Festival is a curated world dance
festival within a Jazz Nutcracker. This unique adaptation of the holiday
classic aims to expose and educate the audience about all different kinds of
cultural dance and world music, promote fair business practice and diversity in
dance, and celebrate the unique cultures that all call New York City home.
SHOW
SYNOPISIS
Set
to Duke Ellington's jazz arrangement of Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker suite, Act 1
opens on a hoppin' holiday party in a Harlem Brownstone at the height of the
roaring 20's. At the party, Clara receives a nutcracker doll from her
mysterious uncle Dross L. Myer. Little does she know that the Nutcracker has a
magical spell cast upon it. Later that night the Nutcracker tethers a magical
snowstorm that carries Clara on a magical adventure to the 1922 World's Fair in
Rio De Janiero.
In
Act 2, the world's fair,
guest performances by New York City's top cultural dance companies bring 
traditional dance and music of their cultures to the stage.
HISTORY
OF THE PRODUCTION
Dance
the World Nutcracker Festival is now three years in the making. It began as
1/2hour show for school children (then titled Nutcracker on Lenox Ave)
that  was commissioned by Riverbank State Park in Harlem in 2013. 
Petrusak decided to rework
The Nutcracker in order to pay homage to rich artistic history of Harlem, and
to create a platform on which to teach the children about all types of dance;
jazz, tap, modern, and a variety of cultural dances.  Wanting to expose
the children to authentic cultural dance and traditional world music rather
than ballet inspired by cultures, Petrusak decided not to choreograph the second act
herself. Instead she turned to her very diverse company of dancers to perform
traditional dances from their countries such as Taiwanese fan dance, Brazilian
Samba, and Dunyavi Roma (world Gypsy).
The show a success and
was invited back to Riverbank for a second year and additional performances for
the general public. In two years of presenting at Riverbank, the show has
reached over 5,000 school children, senior citizens, and families.
Now,
in its third year, Petrusak is premiering the performance as she originally
envisioned it; an evening length production with a world dance festival
embedded into the 2nd act. The first act and supporting roles in the second act
are choreographed by Petrusak and will be danced by JP Dance Group. The second act will feature the festival of professional cultural dance groups.
This
Production and Fair Business Practice in the Arts
JP
Dance Group advocates fair business practice and will implement fair business
practice in the production Dance the World Nutcracker Festival. This means
that:

Box
     office proceeds will be split fairly with all participating artists
No
     application fee will be charged to applying guest artists
All
     applications will be granted fair reviewed by a panel of dance
     professionals
All
     technical professionals (lighting designers, videographers, photographers,
     etc..)will be compensated
The
     festival will be professionally promoted in an effort to gain worthwhile
     exposure (i.e. potential presenters, new audiences, press reviews) for all
     artists involved

What the show needs:

Dancers. Dancers will be compensated fairly each nigh they perform.
JP Dance Group advocates fair pay in dance.
Technical
staff. A professional lighting designer,
stage manager, videographer, and photographer will be hired for the production
Marketing. The show will be marketed to the general public, the press, and local organizations. We need help in spreading the world and creating professional marketing materials
Programs. The programs will not just outline the Production, but will
also provide background information on the participating guest artists, the
cultural significance of the dances they are performing. This extra information
is expensive but will deeply enhance the audiences experience and appreciation
of what they are viewing.


The Impact
Supporting this production will help expose audiences to all different kinds of traditional world dance, promote cultural understanding, and celebrate diversity in dance.
Risks & Challenges
Part of JP Dance Group's mission is to provide affordable
access to the arts and thus we are keeping tickets under $30 and are offering
student and senior discounts. However, this also means that our projected costs
of the production out-weigh the projected box office proceeds.  We are seeking the help of individual donors, sponsorships, and grants to help make this
production the best it can possibly be.


The proceeds of this campaign are  specifically earmarked to provide fair 
compensation for our hardworking dancers and technical staff. If you 
would like to sponsor another need of the show, visit our direct 
donations link with our fiscal Sponsor, The Field: http://thefield.org/form/donate-artist and select Julie Petrusak/JP Dance Group form the menu.

     this production and diversity in dance

Volunteer. We need volunteers to help with behind the scenes and

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Sylvie Bouchard, I am the founder and Artistic Director of <strong>BoucharDanse</strong>, a Toronto-based contemporary dance company that is celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2020. As an artist, I am especially interested in new artistic concepts and projects that are collaborative in nature and where a journey can be witnessed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580224959/xhh8nqttox14simsxlfc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>At the moment, I am working on a very special project, a visual and kinaesthetic installation titled <i><strong>très loin</strong></i>. <i><strong>très loin</strong></i> brings together my two passions: dance and the art of psychotherapy. Besides being a dancer and choreographer, I have also practiced psychotherapy and I am still involved in the field. I know first-hand how important it is to have support when we go through difficult times and <i><strong>très loin</strong></i> speaks about this. </p>
<p><i><strong>très loin</strong></i> explores how psychological trauma affects one's psyche and how resilience plays a role in journeys of recovery. The piece looks closely at how our mind and body deal with the consequences of trauma, but most importantly, it portraits the incredible strength, courage and perseverance needed to surmount these experiences. With <i><strong>très loin</strong></i>, I am attempting to tell this story through dance.</p>
<p>In order to bring <i><strong>très loin </strong></i>to life with my team of outstanding collaborators, I need your help. We need to fund two more phases of creation before the work premieres, in Toronto, in the spring of 2021.</p>
<p>The <strong>team</strong> working on this production is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Acclaimed visual artist <strong>Ed Pien</strong> with whom I am collaborating closely. Ed is creating the incredible visual art that inhabits the space;</li>
<li>Brilliant theatre artist and director <strong>Anne-Marie Donovan</strong> who is our dramaturg and with whom I have a very strong artistic connection;</li>
<li>Accomplished composer <strong>Phil Strong</strong> who creates the sound scores and musical compositions and with whom I have a long history of working;</li>
<li>Exceptional lighting designer <strong>André du Toit</strong> who will bring magic to this installation;</li>
<li>Four incredible dancers <strong>Meredith Thompson, Molly Johnson, Luke Garwood and Michael Caldwell</strong> who are also active co-creators of the movement material.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579808204/rdy2t78kjabgdhtvtilf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>From left to right, top to bottom: André du Toit, Anne-Marie Donovan, Ed Pien, Luke Garwood, Meredith Thompson, Michael Caldwell, Molly Johnson and Phil Strong.</i></p>
<p>I am honoured and proud to be working with these amazing artists and very generous people, and I thank them wholeheartedly for their artistic and creative contributions.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><i><strong>très loin</strong></i> has a very specific creation process - working collaboratively with all the art forms means that all <strong>collaborators are required to be in rehearsal</strong> almost all the time. Additionally, because the dancers interact with Ed Pien’s art pieces (the art pieces are raised and lowered to and from the stage at different times in the piece), it is crucial for us to create the <strong>work in a theatre space</strong>, which is costly. All of us believe in this work very strongly and we want to make sure that we have a proper amount of time to create it. </p>
<p>BoucharDanse is a charitable organization. We receive a small amount of operating funding each year from the Ontario Arts Council and the Toronto Arts Council. A small percentage of these funds go towards the creation of <i><strong>très loin </strong></i>and so we need to raise the rest of the revenue through other sources, one being fundraising and donations. </p>
<p>The reasons above are why we are asking for your help - we are aiming to <strong>fundraise $5,000 CAD</strong> through this campaign to help us go ahead with our next creation phase that is scheduled for December 2020.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580224991/n9admsuh55h2wp4shmha.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The funds received through this campaign will be <strong>fully spent on the next creation period of <i>très loin</i> and within the four categories below</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fees for the artistic team (choreographer, dramaturg, composer, visual artist and lighting designer)</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Mental health</strong> is more important than ever. Discussions and conversations about mental health are now surfacing, which is a huge and crucial step in our society. The creation of this work means a lot to me because it is a way to give voice, through the body, to survivors of trauma, for the incredible amount of courage that they need, day in and day out, to build (or rebuild) trust, connection, joy and a feeling of freedom.</p>
<p>My most recent choreographic works look at the <strong>unconscious and at its disconcerting course</strong>. In <i><strong>très loin</strong></i>, we also look at dissociation, a normal response to an abnormal situation (abuse, violence, danger, etc.). This state lingers in the body and mind of the survivor. With the creation of <i><strong>très loin</strong></i> comes the desire to touch on a more personal theme, and the strong desire to celebrate our humanity, strengths and vulnerabilities while demonstrating how emotional support is essential to chart new ways of being after surviving a major trauma. One of the goals of undertaking the creation of this installation is to bring the impact of trauma to the forefront and hopefully create more awareness and understanding.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With the excellence of our artistic team, the work that has been done so far, and BoucharDanse’s solid reputation and experience in producing, we are confident that this project will be successful.</p>
<p>However, funding can sometimes take longer than expected. If this happens with the creation of <i><strong>très loin</strong></i>, we will take longer to create the work, but we will for certain still bring the project to completion. </p>

Now my network in this business is extensive enough that I feel ready to set up my own opera company; and I have a production idea for one of my favourite operas, <i>The Turn of the Screw<i>, </i></i>to launch us. <strong>Enigma Chamber Opera</strong> has one major backer already, but we need to raise the rest of the funds to give the company a strong start, and to make this show happen; and that is where YOU come in!</p><p>I've got together a team of incredible professionals - singers, conductor, designers, musicians - and hired a theatre in Boston, for performances in January 2020.</p><p>With your help, we can create an amazing production of this exciting work, staging innovative opera, and exploring Britten's masterpiece in <strong>an entirely new interpretation -​ with an entirely new company.</strong></p><p>Creating art and making music are more important than ever, in this tumultuous world. Be an angel and help us to create something profound and beautiful! </p><h3>What will be different about Enigma Chamber Opera?</h3><p>The plan is that Enigma Chamber Opera will be a rep company; a  group of artists (singers, conductors, designers, and director) who know each other, from whom will be drawn the company for each show. These artists are all experienced, highly skilled, established professionals, all of whom can work quickly to create the highest standard of work in a short time frame. Shows will be chamber repertoire (small cast, small orchestra) from any period, and staging will be innovative and flexible. Though our base will be Boston, the intention is that Enigma will be a multinational company, performing in venues and at festivals around the world. We'll be a travelling troupe of players, coming together for short periods to inspire each other and our audiences.  </p><h3>Why this show?</h3><p><i>The Turn of the Screw</i> (based on the Henry James novella) is a fascinating story, which raises many questions. It appears to be a ghost story, but one is never quite sure if the main character is imagining the phantoms. A woman who is hired to look after two children begins to believe that they are being haunted by a former governess and valet; but is it her own mind which is summoning up such visions?</p><p>A conversation some years ago with a friend who has some mental health concerns, about how she sometimes 'saw' things which she knew were not real, but which haunted her, made me wonder: what if the entire story is in the mind of the 'Governess'? Perhaps not only the 'ghosts', but indeed even the children and the housekeeper, are figments of her imagination. What begins as an enjoyable fantasy, a daydream to escape her unhappy life, turns on her and becomes a waking nightmare which she cannot control. </p><p>Thus Britten's powerful opera, and James' compelling story, becomes an exploration of mental health, and of the power - and fragility - of the mind.</p><p><i>The Turn of the Screw</i> is an ideal piece for a fledgling chamber opera company to stage. The cast is small (six people), the orchestra a chamber ensemble, and in this interpretation of the plot, we can use cleverly designed production elements to make it relatively affordable and manageable. But <strong>we need YOUR HELP to make it happen!</strong></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>All the artistic elements of this production are already in place - this production is happening! We have the venue, the performers, the players, the designers. <strong>All we need is the funding</strong>. <strong>Every single dollar we raise will be spent making OPERA</strong>!</p><p>We are also looking for backers who would like to be associated with Enigma Chamber Opera going forward; be founder supporters of our company, and help us to plan for future productions!</p><p>We have some exciting perks for our backers (reception with performers! a private voice performance just for you!), including a way to access the LIVE STREAM, so you can see the final show even if you can't be in Boston in January. This will be the only opportunity to see our inaugural production: watch it <strong>live</strong>, in Boston or via streaming. </p><h3>Why crowdfund?</h3><p>Creating art is infinitely rewarding, but even with careful planning, it isn't cheap. We do it because we are passionate about it - but finding the money to make it happen is hard. In recent years, many small opera and theatre companies have closed down, unable to make ends meet. The grants and arts programs that used to be out there to help small companies have all but disappeared. We at Enigma Chamber Opera are fortunate to have secured one major donor, but we need to raise more. Of course we hope to sell out both performances! - but it would be prohibitive to cover costs with ticket sales;  we want people to be able to afford to come and see the show! </p><p>Our fabulous creative team is committed to putting on a successful and professional production on a tight budget.  We hold to the highest standards in all our work, so you can trust your donations will be used carefully.  </p><p>Here is the outstanding team:</p><p><strong>Conductor                             </strong>Kristo Kondakci (Kendall Square Orchestra, Eureka Ensemble)</p><p><strong>Set and lighting designer</strong>  Peter Torpey (MIT Media Lab)</p><p><strong>Costume designer </strong>                Rebecca Butler (Costume Director, The Boston Conservatory at Berklee)</p><p><strong>Matthew DiBattista            </strong>as Peter Quint </p><p><strong>Aliana de la Guardia</strong>             as The Governess</p><p><strong>Janna Baty</strong>                                as Mrs Grose</p><p><strong>Michelle Trainor</strong>                      as Miss Jessel</p><p><strong>Erin Matthews</strong>                         as Flora</p><p><strong>Matvey Soykin                      </strong>as Miles</p><p>Plus of course we will have an extraordinary orchestra; and I'll be directing.</p><h3>Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Every single dollar makes a difference - no donation is too small!

What begins as an enjoyable fantasy, a daydream to escape her unhappy life, turns on her and becomes a waking nightmare which she cannot control. Thus Britten's powerful opera, and James' compelling story, becomes an exploration of mental health, and of the power - and fragility - of the mind.The Turn of the Screw is an ideal piece for a fledgling chamber opera company to stage. The cast is small (six people), the orchestra a chamber ensemble, and in this interpretation of the plot, we can use cleverly designed production elements to make it relatively affordable and manageable. But we need YOUR HELP to make it happen!What We Need & What You GetAll the artistic elements of this production are already in place - this production is happening! We have the venue, the performers, the players, the designers. All we need is the funding. Every single dollar we raise will be spent making OPERA!We are also looking for backers who would like to be associated with Enigma Chamber Opera going forward; be founder supporters of our company, and help us to plan for future productions!We have some exciting perks for our backers (reception with performers! a private voice performance just for you!), including a way to access the LIVE STREAM, so you can see the final show even if you can't be in Boston in January. This will be the only opportunity to see our inaugural production: watch it live, in Boston or via streaming. Why crowdfund?Creating art is infinitely rewarding, but even with careful planning, it isn't cheap. We do it because we are passionate about it - but finding the money to make it happen is hard. In recent years, many small opera and theatre companies have closed down, unable to make ends meet. The grants and arts programs that used to be out there to help small companies have all but disappeared. We at Enigma Chamber Opera are fortunate to have secured one major donor, but we need to raise more. Of course we hope to sell out both performances! - but it would be prohibitive to cover costs with ticket sales;  we want people to be able to afford to come and see the show! Our fabulous creative team is committed to putting on a successful and professional production on a tight budget.  We hold to the highest standards in all our work, so you can trust your donations will be used carefully.  Here is the outstanding team:Conductor                             Kristo Kondakci (Kendall Square Orchestra, Eureka Ensemble)Set and lighting designer  Peter Torpey (MIT Media Lab)Costume designer                 Rebecca Butler (Costume Director, The Boston Conservatory at Berklee)Matthew DiBattista            as Peter Quint Aliana de la Guardia             as The GovernessJanna Baty                                as Mrs GroseMichelle Trainor                      as Miss JesselErin Matthews                         as FloraMatvey Soykin                      as MilesPlus of course we will have an extraordinary orchestra; and I'll be directing.Ways You Can HelpEvery single dollar makes a difference - no donation is too small! We are excited to offer perks to donors who give $20 or more; please check out the tiers and donate according to your comfort level, and to what takes your fancy!   If you can't donate, please help us to spread the word! There are Indiegogo 'Share' tools you can use to let folks know about this campaign. Encourage your friends to support the arts! And don't forget to buy tickets and come and see the show in January; or pledge to get the Live Stream access if you can't be in Boston! Please note: The Live Stream password is only included in the $50, $100, $200 and $250 perks.Any pledge $20 and up will mean your name goes up on our 'supporters list' on our Facebook page. All pledges of $100 and up will also be listed in our printed programme for the show.  If you'd prefer to remain anonymous, please let us know!  Finally, we are happy to tailor a 'perk' for YOU, so far as is possible. If you'd like something in particular in return for your donation, such as supporting our after show reception, or sponsoring a particular cast member, please email Kirsten and make your request:  kzcairns@hotmail.comPerks do NOT include tickets to the opera performances, unless specifically stated. Please call the New England Conservatory Box Office to book tickets: 617 585 1260This production is a sponsored project of Guerilla Opera, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization. These means that your donations are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law. We are very grateful to Guerilla Opera for supporting us in this way! THANK YOU for helping us to make opera's newest company, Enigma Chamber Opera, a success!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2>A Monologue from Our Founder</h2>
<p>During these uncertain times, the theater and arts community came together to find ways to keep the arts alive and relevant. With the current circumstances, artists are faced with many challenges one being technology. Technology offers a wealth of information and opportunities, but it also has its draw backs. Knowing this, this brings us to the question of “How do we create LIVE theater virtually”. </p>
<p>I’ve thought about ways I could continue to spread the joy of theater from the comforts of our homes.  I’ve also looked into possibilities to potentially provide jobs to not only to actors, but to all artist involved in creating the works you normally would see on stage. With new and current technologies, I was able to find a way to bring a live experience to a virtual audience. </p>
<p>With many late-night phone calls, hours on zoom, crazy technological experiments, and a plethora of passion, I present to you Morpheus Productions Company LLC. MPC’s aim is to transform live theater. My team and I are excited to share a new way to experience theater.

<span>Following years of nurturing through our ongoing Artist Development Program, our artists are now beginning to emerge as pioneers in contemporary Cambodian choreography; creating new, ground-breaking work that reflects their experience of modern Cambodia.<br/><br/></span>
<p>The last twelve years of creative and considered investment has enabled us to create a sustainable, long-term foundation for our young Cambodian artists and arts<span>  professionals to develop in this sector. </span></p>
<p><span>Now, once again, we find ourselves at a point where we are challenged to match the growth of our artists with opportunities that can fully support them to reach their creative potential. Our investment has led us to a stage in which we need to bring our artist to the next level as they look to bringing their own Cambodian contemporary works to the world. </span></p>

</div><div><i>Images courtesy of Roly Touch, Anders Jiras, Chih Yu Lin, &amp; ArtcomArt.</i></div></div>","Our Cambodian choreographers have been developing into pioneers in Cambodian contemporary dance. 
Before now, they have only ever been able to access artistic full-time training opportunities abroad and have only had the resources to create dance pieces to an initial stage. Cambodia's artistic climate currently lacks the space, funds and resources for them to bring this work to completion.
We want to change this.
With your support, in 2016 we will create our first full-time 3 month residency in Cambodia, especially for the next generation of Cambodian choreographers: 3 months of training, collaboration, rehearsals and nurturing. 
With this opportunity to be fully immersed in the creative process, our artists will be at the forefront of exploring and defining the evolution of Cambodian contemporary dance.








We are Amrita Performing Arts (Amrita), one of the leading performing arts organizations in Cambodia. With a dance company of 17 classically trained Cambodian artists, as well as a strong production team, we produce works of  contemporary dance and theater that tour nationally and internationally. 
Our unique approach to skills development focuses on long-term capacity building of  Cambodian artists and arts professionals as they become pioneers in the arts sector in  Cambodia. 
Following years of nurturing through our ongoing Artist Development Program, our artists are now beginning to emerge as pioneers in contemporary Cambodian choreography; creating new, ground-breaking work that reflects their experience of modern Cambodia.
The last twelve years of creative and considered investment has enabled us to create a sustainable, long-term foundation for our young Cambodian artists and arts  professionals to develop in this sector. 
Now, once again, we find ourselves at a point where we are challenged to match the growth of our artists with opportunities that can fully support them to reach their creative potential. Our investment has led us to a stage in which we need to bring our artist to the next level as they look to bringing their own Cambodian contemporary works to the world. 
CAMBODIAN LEADERSHIP


""CHOREOGRAPHY FOR ME IS NOT ONLY ABOUT MAKING DANCE, IT'S 
ALSO...TO QUESTION ONESELF AND TO QUESTION THE THINGS THAT ONE HAS NEVER
 ASKED BEFORE.""  

                                                                           -  Chankethya Chey , Artistic Director

Both our Executive Director, Rithisal Kang  (Sal), and Artistic Director, Chankethya Chey (Kethya), developed their
early arts careers as arts manager and dancer/choreographer respectively through Amrita. After years of nurturing, they both received Fulbright Scholarships with additional support from the Asian Cultural Council (ACC) to study in the US, both the first Cambodian Fulbright scholars in their field of study. 
Their stories demonstrates the inbuilt culture within Amrita for sustainable capacity
building at all levels. We believe this culture is reflective of the trajectory of development trends in Cambodia today, and something that underpins all our activities.
In this way, Amrita is working to nurture the next leaders in arts, culture and choreography.  



“IF DANCE TRULY IS THE LANGUAGE OF THE SOUL, CONTEMPORARY
CAMBODIA IS HAVING A GLOBAL CONVERSATION ”

                                                                                         -Cassandra Naji, The Advisor

In response to our artists' desire for space, mentorship and resources to be able to realize their own creative visions, in 2013 we launched our first Contemporary Dance Platform, a six week experience, in which we commissioned our artists to create new work.
The Platform offered a safe and nurturing space in which Cambodian choreographers could challenge their own social and artistic sensibilities in creating new works. These cutting edge works tackled head on crucial topics such as power-struggles, mental health,  relationships, women’s rights and much more.

Now, three years on, we are moving to the next step. Building on the work of the Contemporary Dance Platform, we are looking to support our artists to take their choreography even further. 
The Choreographic Residency we are planning to launch in 2016 will provide a more profound creative experience for the artists to continue heightening their choreographic capacity and artistic leadership.






This residency will be an immersive 3-month
program for 3 choreographers and 6 dancers. Led by our Artistic Leadership
team, we will provide the studio space, funds and resources for our artists to
work as full-time choreographers: only concentrating on the creative process. For the first time in their own country, our artists will have the tools to fully realize their creative visions and gain enormous artistic development in the process.


Over the three months our Artistic Leadership Team will
design a bespoke, intensive curriculum of choreographic workshops, research topics and
classes, tailored to the creative drives and needs of the participants. 
We will also be inviting international and local experts to collaborate and give workshops on areas such as dramaturgy, lighting design, music composition, in which our artists wish to develop. Ultimately, these three months will hugely increase our artists creative and professional potential as they look to the building their future careers as choreographers.


CHOREOGRAPHY, COMPLETED.
Throughout the three months, our artists will receive individual mentoring whilst they experiment on and rehearse their works-in-progress to completion. 
We anticipate that by the end of three months, our
artists will have had the time, mentoring and resources to complete their
original choreography. 


With a new repertoire of cutting-edge Cambodian contemporary pieces, we will then look to tour internationally.

<div>I'm currently a part of the BFA Program at New World School of the Arts College in Miami, FL. This program challenges us as dancers and artists as we train full-time in all aspects of technical training and repertory. Some of the techniques include Ballet, Alignment, Composition, Graham, Horton, Limon, and Movement Analysis. New World provides us with all the tools we need as emerging artists to head out into the Professional world. (Which we all know is a scary yet beautiful place.) As the program does provide us with fundamentals, it is up to us to venture out and find where we best fit. </div>
<div>As I wrap up my 2nd year with the program, it feels as though Graduation is nearby and I need to get my big boy pants on and figure out where my dance journey is headed. I'm being pretty ambitious with my energy this Summer and hoping to have completed 3 intensive programs by the end of it.

</div><h1>ABOUT THE PROJECT </h1><p>We've been invited to bring the ultimate comedy horror musical to the ultimate horror convention - Bruce Campbell's HORRORFEST! </p><p>We
 want to bring EVIL DEAD THE MUSICAL to Bruce's convention and we want 
to do it right! The team behind this show have been painting Las Vegas 
BLOODY for years and we're coming up on our 3rd anniversary on the Las 
Vegas Strip. That's THREE YEARS of spraying hundreds of gallons of blood
 over our audiences, THREE YEARS of chainsaw-roaring awesomeness, THREE 
YEARS of the biggest, baddest, BLOODIEST show on the Las Vegas Strip! </p><p>We
 were told the show wouldn't last a month. With the support of our fans,
 we've shown that shows like this not only have a place in Las Vegas, 
but can thrive there! </p><p>The HORRORFEST project will take place 
August 22nd and 23rd in Chicago! We'll be performing once each night, 
with Bruce Campbell himself set to emcee the festivities. </p><p>We want
 to keep prices low so that as many fans of the show can see it as 
possible, and to help offset the revenue generated by potential ticket 
sales we are asking you to help us bring this show to the stage. </p><h1>WHY WE NEED THE HELP </h1><p>Our
 production company is relatively small and even though we have a 
successful show on the Las Vegas Strip, there are expenses associated 
with this project that are just too much for us to bear on our own. It 
is an amazing opportunity and an honor to be invited by Bruce Campbell 
himself to be a part of his very own convention, and it is something we 
do not want to miss out on. At the same time, we don't want to be forced
 to present our show using sock puppets for demons and ketchup for 
blood.</p><p>
Where the money is to be spent: transportation to get the show to 
Chicago, all the props (such as the chainsaw, heads, hands, evil trees, a
 giant evil moose, etc) needed for the HORRORFEST Edition, a great deal 
of special effects makeup, TONS of blood, plus food, housing, and pay 
for the cast and crew!</p><h1>

<div>
<p><b>Will there be a Splatter Zone?</b></p>
<p>Yes! This is EVIL DEAD The Musical after all, not
Oklahoma! We have worked out details with the convention to ensure there will
indeed be a Splatter Zone. Persons who buy splatter zone tickets will also
receive a commemorative t-shirt, perfect for soaking in all the blood.</p>
<p><b>Is there an age limit on who can attend the show?</b></p>
<p>There is coarse language, violent situations, and a
great deal of blood sprayed during this show. Not to mention the horror aspects
of dancing demons, singing zombies, and a sinister evil moose. </p>
<p>So while we would not restrict anyone from
attending, we recommend that you be at least 10 years old. This is a show
intended for persons who can handle mature themes.</p>
<p>Also, we ask that parents leave their infants and
toddlers at home. Unless they want them scarred for life, of course.</p>
<p><b>Where exactly will the funds go?</b></p>
<p>Here is the basic breakdown of costs for the show:</p>
<p>1. Royalties - $5,000</p>
<p>2. Special effects - $3,000</p>
<p>3. Sound system - $1,000</p>
<p>4. Costumes - $500</p>

<p></p>
<p><b>PARA DESARROLLAR EL TEATRO INDEPENDIENTE NACIONAL</b></p>
<p>La directora teatral <b>Carolina Lett</b> está dirigiendo su próxima
obra: <b>“Naturaleza Humana”</b>. El estreno es el <b>próximo 14 de mayo</b> del 2015. <b>Falta solo un mes.</b> <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Y ya tenemos el lugar de las funciones, un
espacio escénico llamado Gráfica Génesis, en San José, Costa Rica.</span></p>
<p>Resulta que con los reducidos  presupuestos a los proyectos de cultura y que prácticamente
no existen fondos ni apoyo al sector independiente, <b>no tenemos dinero para
completar lo que falta para llevar a cabo nuestro proyecto</b>, ¡pero tenemos muchas
ganas de hacer teatro!</p>
<p><b>WHY WE INVITE YOU TO THIS CAMPAIGN?</b></p>
<p>TO DEVELOP THE INDEPENDENT NATIONAL THEATRE</p>
<p></p>The theater director Carolina Lett is directing his next theaterplay: ""Human Nature"". The premiere is next May 14, 2015. Missing just one month. And we have the place of functions, a scenic area called Graph Genesis, in San José, Costa Rica.</div><div>It turns out that with reduced budgets to projects in culture and there is virtually no funding or support for the independent sector, we have no money to complete what is lacking to carry out our project, <b>but we really wanted to do theater!</b>

<p>Son 5 actores maravillosos: <b>Álvaro Marenco, Jennifer Sánchez,
Maud Le Chartier, Daniel Astorga y Jaime Gutierréz</b>. Además contamos con un súper
equipo artístico y de producción, entre ellos están Mariela Richmond, Nicolás
Wong, Alexandra Latishev, Mariana Delgado, Lucía Meléndez, Sylvia Sossa, Ricardo
Kandler, entre muchos otros. </p>
<p></p>There are 5 wonderful actors: Alvaro Marenco, Jennifer Sanchez, Maud Le Chartier, Daniel Astorga and Jaime Gutierréz. We also have a super artistic and production team, including being Mariela Richmond, Nicholas Wong, Alexandra Latishev, Mariana Delgado, Lucía Meléndez, Sylvia Sossa, Ricardo Kandler, among many others.</div><div>
<p>Es difícil encarar el proceso creativo en un contexto desfavorable, debido al desconocimiento tácito de producciones de espectáculos independientes en
pequeño formato y la enorme dificultad para generar acciones reivindicativas a
nivel social. </p>
<p>La capacidad de producción cultural y el teatro independiente se integran para seguir generando fuentes de empleo y obtener recursos económicos para consolidar espacios, grupos y proyectos artísticos y contribuyen en el desarrollo del medio teatral costarricense y promueven un espacio de diálogo y reflexión para el público.</p>
<p><b>En Costa Rica</b>, debido al poco presupuesto estatal dedicado a
proyectos teatrales, la mayoría de grupos independientes o directores de teatro
independiente buscan la forma de seguir activos y desarrollan obras no
comerciales, de carácter profesional y comprometidas con la sociedad. </p>
<p>A pesar de subsidios insuficientes, se sigue haciendo teatro. Profesionales
del medio teatral se interesan y se esfuerzan por buscar la excelencia por
medio de investigaciones, laboratorios y largos periodos de ensayos para
encontrar nuevos lenguajes teatrales.</p>

¿PORQUÉ TE INVITAMOS A ESTA CAMPAÑA?

PARA DESARROLLAR EL TEATRO INDEPENDIENTE NACIONAL
La directora teatral Carolina Lett está dirigiendo su próxima
obra: “Naturaleza Humana”. El estreno es el próximo 14 de mayo del 2015. Falta solo un mes. Y ya tenemos el lugar de las funciones, un
espacio escénico llamado Gráfica Génesis, en San José, Costa Rica.
Resulta que con los reducidos  presupuestos a los proyectos de cultura y que prácticamente
no existen fondos ni apoyo al sector independiente, no tenemos dinero para
completar lo que falta para llevar a cabo nuestro proyecto, ¡pero tenemos muchas
ganas de hacer teatro!
WHY WE INVITE YOU TO THIS CAMPAIGN?
TO DEVELOP THE INDEPENDENT NATIONAL THEATRE
The theater director Carolina Lett is directing his next theaterplay: ""Human Nature"". The premiere is next May 14, 2015. Missing just one month. And we have the place of functions, a scenic area called Graph Genesis, in San José, Costa Rica.It turns out that with reduced budgets to projects in culture and there is virtually no funding or support for the independent sector, we have no money to complete what is lacking to carry out our project, but we really wanted to do theater!


Son 5 actores maravillosos: Álvaro Marenco, Jennifer Sánchez,
Maud Le Chartier, Daniel Astorga y Jaime Gutierréz. Además contamos con un súper
equipo artístico y de producción, entre ellos están Mariela Richmond, Nicolás
Wong, Alexandra Latishev, Mariana Delgado, Lucía Meléndez, Sylvia Sossa, Ricardo
Kandler, entre muchos otros. 
There are 5 wonderful actors: Alvaro Marenco, Jennifer Sanchez, Maud Le Chartier, Daniel Astorga and Jaime Gutierréz. We also have a super artistic and production team, including being Mariela Richmond, Nicholas Wong, Alexandra Latishev, Mariana Delgado, Lucía Meléndez, Sylvia Sossa, Ricardo Kandler, among many others.
Es difícil encarar el proceso creativo en un contexto desfavorable, debido al desconocimiento tácito de producciones de espectáculos independientes en
pequeño formato y la enorme dificultad para generar acciones reivindicativas a
nivel social. 
La capacidad de producción cultural y el teatro independiente se integran para seguir generando fuentes de empleo y obtener recursos económicos para consolidar espacios, grupos y proyectos artísticos y contribuyen en el desarrollo del medio teatral costarricense y promueven un espacio de diálogo y reflexión para el público.
En Costa Rica, debido al poco presupuesto estatal dedicado a
proyectos teatrales, la mayoría de grupos independientes o directores de teatro
independiente buscan la forma de seguir activos y desarrollan obras no
comerciales, de carácter profesional y comprometidas con la sociedad. 
A pesar de subsidios insuficientes, se sigue haciendo teatro. Profesionales
del medio teatral se interesan y se esfuerzan por buscar la excelencia por
medio de investigaciones, laboratorios y largos periodos de ensayos para
encontrar nuevos lenguajes teatrales.

¿CUANTO CUESTA PONER EN ESCENA LA OBRA NATURALEZA HUMANA?
HOW MUCH TO PUT ON STAGE HUMAN NATURE?
Para hacer la obra y que las personas involucradas puedan
dedicarle su tiempo profesional de una manera eficiente es necesario disponer
de fondos que compensen ese tiempo, como en cualquier otra profesión.
To do the work and the people involved can devote his professional time in an efficient manner is necessary to have funds to compensate the time, like in any other profession.
Los costos, incluyendo utilería, alquiler de espacio escénico,
pago de actores, maquillaje, vestuario, iluminación, video, animación digital y
comida, son de 10 mil dólares.
The costs, including props, stage space rental, pay actors, makeup, costumes, lighting, video, digital animation and food, are $ 10,000.

Nosotros podemos cubrir la mitad de esos costos con las
entradas  del los días de función
en mayo, pero para el resto no tenemos presupuesto… 
We can cover half of those costs to the inputs of performance days in May, but for the rest we have no budget ...
Son 4900 dólares, sí, CUATRO MIL NOVECIENTOS dólares!!!
Yes $ 4,900 FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND dollars !!


Ésto será íntegramente invertido en vestuario, escenografía, equipo de iluminación, sonido, animación
digital, composición musical, entre otros.
Estamos acostumbrados a trabajar con pocos recursos, así que todo será sabiamente administrado.
This will be fully invested in costumes, props, lighting equipment, sound, digital animation, music composition, among others.
We are accustomed to working with limited resources, so everything will be wisely managed.

¿DE QUE TRATA NATURALEZA HUMANA?




Somos seres humanos decadentes, decentes, indecentes, buenos, malos, a veces matamos, a veces damos vida, lloramos, reímos, nos revolcamos de cólera, pedimos ayuda, nos enfermamos para llamar la atención, hacemos buenos actos, vamos a la iglesia, estudiamos, nos metemos el dedo y vomitamos, tomamos antipresivos, hacemos yoga y meditación trascendental, comemos frutas y verduras orgánicas, caemos, chocamos, cogemos con una o varias personas, vamos de shopping, nos asaltan, nos roban el celular, trabajamos día y noche para pagar cuentas, seguimos pasando la tarjeta, fumamos marihuana, tomamos whisky, en la calle se fuma piedra, nos prostituimos de muchas maneras, nos tomamos fotos y las subimos a Instagram, nuestra vida se la contamos a Facebook.
Somos personas que vivimos, dormimos, comemos y nos matamos en algún lugar. Puede ser un edificio, una casa, debajo de un puente, en la calle.
¿Buscamos lo que deseamos o lo que necesitamos?





Nuestra propuesta está inspirada en varios textos del dramatugo Rodrigo García y en la película ""Medianeras"" del cineasta Gustavo Taretto. 

El espacio que habitamos, las personas con las que nos relacionamos, las calles que transitamos y nuestras actividades diarias nos llevaron a pensar como nos afectan a la hora de reaccionar, tomar desiciones y de comunicarnos, tanto con las personas que están a nuestro alrededor, como con nosotros mismos. Tenemos grandes aspiraciones, al mismo tiempo prohibiciones, acciones de sabotaje y de sumisión de uno mismo. Queremos libertades pero nos oprimen. ¿Cómo hacer para mantenernos en la rutina? Buscar lo que no tenemos.

Son 5 actores que darán vida a diferentes personajes que todos conocemos en la realidad, en una historia o en televisión. Son personas que habitan entre nosotros, con nosotros y delante de nosotros. Aunque no los conocemos personalmente, sabemos que existen. Cada uno encarna el deseo: de vida, de muerte, de amor, de trabajo, de sexo, de fama, de tristeza y de soledad, donde todos estamos inmersos.


NATURALEZA HUMANA es una obra para reírnos de nosotros mismos y para evidenciar en lo que todos hemos caído: una sociedad manipuladora, light, con censuras y opresiones.


Esta es una obra para mayores de 16 años.


La duración es de 70 minutos.
