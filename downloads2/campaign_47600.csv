</div></div>","It’s not only a headset. It’s a different way of trendy lifestyle. No need to put earphones into your ears. And no wires to trouble your exercising. Just for safety and comfort. Just for the street cred. It’s AOS SportsBuddy Bone Conduction Headset.




Answering cell phone while driving is easy to neglect the road conditions, and driving with one hand may lead to rear-end accidents easily. 
The one who is jogging or walking without music outdoors would be boring. When we use  traditional headsets, long cable will bring a lot of inconvenience. Sweating after exercise may cause malfunction of the headsets.There will be many problems of long-term wearing earphones just like tinnitus, ear discomfort and so on.
If you have a SportBuddy Bone Conduction Headset, everything is different. 


Open ears design

You can listen to the music or make telephone calls without earphones into your ears. The sound is delivered through bone. Bone conduction is the transmission of sound to the inner ear through the bones of the skull. Its benefits extend beyond normal hearing ranges to work for those with impaired hearing.FUN FACT: Bone conduction is one of the reasons you get weirded out by your own voice when you hear it played back. The skull conducts lower frequencies better than the air, so people perceive their own voices to be lower and fuller than others do.



Design Features 



Enjoy your life with your Sportsbudy




What is inside?



How to use?

 Use:
1.When your headset is off, hold the switchuntil the red and blue lights flash alternately, accompanied by a beep ""enter pairing mode"" .You can pair your phone to the headset.
2.You can find the Bluetooth menu on your device, click on Search for devices, and select ""AOS-S I"" in the list.
3.If connected, you can hear ""paired connected"" .
4. If it takes more than 3 minutes to separate your headset and the connected device, the headset will automatically shut down to save power. And they will connect again when they are in effective distance.
Wearing  style:

Neckband design, the headphones hanging behind the neck and ear speaker to fit in front of the jaw bone, not on the ear.

<p>Fitness has been my passion for nearly half my life. While working in fitness, I taught group fitness classes, personal trained, and had the pleasure of training many female athletes. I always felt frustrated by the lack of fashionable activewear that is available to women.  It seems a woman needs a specific body type to fit into the ""cute"" clothes that are on the market.  Many of my clients wear shorts and t-shirts to workout because they feel there is nothing fashionable that they want to spend the money on and wear.  I personally made my own cycling shorts because the pieces available are masculine and not made for a woman's body.</p>
<p>I believe all women should look and feel their best. At Brick Betty we promise to bring both fashion and function to women of all shapes and sizes! </p>
<p>Our designs are created in feminine, fun colors. No more ""only black"" workout clothes.  We study current trends and spend hours testing fabrics so that we can bring women the absolute best in active apparel. </p>

Our movements are self-winding, meaning they use the motion of the wrist and transform it into kinetic energy via a rotor, and stores in a spring. To manually wind the mechanism, simply turn the crown clockwise a dozen or so times every 48 hours.
Our quality testing standards are ISO 2859-1 (ANSI/ASQC Z1.4-2003), and we thoroughly inspect all components 100% before proceeding to assembly in our very own factory in Pforzheim. Movements are subject to accuracy testing machine with allowable tolerance (+/-0.1ms), and Dials are assembled under an electronic alignment machine. We strive to produce as much as possible ourselves even if it costs us more or takes longer.

 


Super-LumiNova™ is a brand name for strontium aluminate–based non-radioactive and nontoxic photoluminescent or afterglow pigments for illuminating markings on watch dials & hands. This technology offers up to ten times higher brightness than previous zinc sulfide–based materials. We source our pigments exclusively from RC TRITEC SA, the Swiss market leader.






Every purchase of the Multimatic, or purchase of any two or more (2+ pcs) watches ships with this premium collector's box made of wood, a carrying bag and warranty card.All purchases of one (1pc) Regent, Renaissance or Republic come in a premium slim box and a warranty card.https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facer.Waldhoff.fcrm2CWSIEmp5https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facer.Waldhoff.fcrHC77XaKNNMhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facer.Waldhoff.fcr3zNzRb9wbGWe guarantee the quality of our products to be 100% free of defects. If something is defective within two years of your purchase, we will replace your watch free of charge.For your peace of mind; shall you sense that the watch did not meet your expectations when you receive it, just get in touch with us and we will send you a full refund. Risks and challengesOur goal is to manufacture as much as possible ourselves, in our small manufacture in Pforzheim, but there are components that we need to purchase from other vendors, such as dials, hands and the automatic movements.As such, we depend on the timely delivery of some components to deliver products to our buyers, and the availability of some parts fluctuates. However, our manufacture has been in business since over 35 years, and we always delivered our products to our customer within reasonable amounts of time. Both our Swiss and German partners are experienced in watch manufacturing, leading to a high safety level for our supporters.At this stage we have completed design, engineering testing and calibration, and have overcome all technical obstacles. We produced tooling for our cases, dials, straps and hands in the winter of 2016, and now have real working samples of all four watch lines. All we need at this time is to raise funds to start production. Assembled watches are subject to water resistance and air pressure resistance testing, impact resistance, corrosion and abrasion testing, and final accuracy testing",66.0,7,"3 Campaigns

Our products are created using superior quality canvas that is coated with a special paraffin wax that creates a leather-like texture. We had a successful campaign of this product in Japan, and this time we have made several changes from the previous version.</p><p> </p><h2>Description </h2><p>Baksteen is a minimalistic crossbody bag designed and manufactured by Solahanpu. The external layer of the bag is made of canvass material while the internal layer is made of the water-proof material called tarpaulin. Baksteen's zipper is placed hidden right behind your back, making it impossible to open without your knowledge. You have probably noticed that any crossbody bags or messenger bags tend to swing toward your side when riding a bike. The mini-strap comes with Baksteen prevents the annoying swing from happening ever again. There are two pockets inside Baksteen; one is behind the opening lid, the other is in the main compartment.

No longer do have to be overloaded with several bags or wonder where you placed your baby’s pacifier or bottle. Our new, <b><i>patent pending</i></b>, all-in-one, innovative Sassi Momma D’imorga Handbags have it all, even a changing pad to protect your baby’s bottom.  We also have an additional strap for the detachable section and stroller straps to attach to your stroller.</span></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/661135/files/20140619135348-SMinside.jpg?1403211228"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>                    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/661381/files/20140619154642-CAM00948.jpg?1403218002"" src="""" style=""width: 367.72px; height: 490px;""/></p><p></p><p></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>WHAT’S THE “WUY” MOVEMENT?</b></p>
<p>Since the airing of our feature on the
Bethenny Show, we received some great comments and advice about our Handbags,
and we want to say THANK YOU to everyone who shared their thoughts and
suggestions! We listened closely to everyone's advice, and created a new
innovated design of our D’imorga Handbags! So exciting!</p>
<p>But we also wanted to let our customers
know that there’s more to us than just bags.  We wanted to make a difference and help the
women and children who are in need in our country, so we created our “WuY”
Movement, standing for Women Understanding Why. </p>
<p>A percentage of each D'imorga Handbag
purchased would go to various women or children's charities like the Breast

&amp; SHARE WITH ALL YOUR FRIENDS! </span><br/></p><br/><p></p></div>","The idea for Sassi Momma D’imorga Handbags started seven years ago after the birth of my second daughter.  Most of the time I had to carry her, my personal handbag, her diaper bag, and sometimes even our baby’s car seat.  And for the most part, I was constantly digging and fumbling through my handbag or her Diaper bag to find her pacifier or my keys.  My ahah moment came to me one day as I walked to my car from the mall in the pouring rain.  I had all of these items in my hand plus now an umbrella.As I get to the car, I started fumbling and digging in my handbag for my keys, realizing after a few minutes they were buried deep down inside my daughter’s diaper bag.  After finding my long lost keys, I placed her and the other items in the car.  I then run around to the driver’s side, open the door, and hop in quickly.  I placed my hands on the steering wheel, took a deep breath, and thought to myself, “There has to be a better way.” And that was it! That my friends, was the beginning of our handbag journey…the beginning of Sassi Momma. XoXo Nicole Hawkins, CEO, Sassi Momma  WHAT DOES D’IMORGA MEAN?The name “D'imorga” was formed by combining the ingredients of the purposes of our bags. The ""D'i"" was acquired from the words diaper bag, the ""m"" was abstracted from the word ""multifunctional,"" and ""orga"" stands for the organizational aspect of our bags. Neat huh?! So uniquely crafted…just like our handbags! WHAT MAKES YOUR BAG DIFFERENT?The distinct difference between our handbags and any other handbags ordiaper bags are the two large zippered sections, which house over 15 unique,carefully thought out compartments to help moms maintain organization within their handbag. But wait; there’s more!  The GREATEST thing about ourhandbags is that the baby’s section is detachable; thus, creating a simple wayto furnish your daycare provider or baby sister with the required items to takecare of your baby’s needs. No longer do have to be overloaded with several bags or wonder where you placed your baby’s pacifier or bottle. Our new, patent pending, all-in-one, innovative Sassi Momma D’imorga Handbags have it all, even a changing pad to protect your baby’s bottom.  We also have an additional strap for the detachable section and stroller straps to attach to your stroller.                     WHAT’S THE “WUY” MOVEMENT?
Since the airing of our feature on the
Bethenny Show, we received some great comments and advice about our Handbags,
and we want to say THANK YOU to everyone who shared their thoughts and
suggestions! We listened closely to everyone's advice, and created a new
innovated design of our D’imorga Handbags! So exciting!
But we also wanted to let our customers
know that there’s more to us than just bags.  We wanted to make a difference and help the
women and children who are in need in our country, so we created our “WuY”
Movement, standing for Women Understanding Why. 
A percentage of each D'imorga Handbag
purchased would go to various women or children's charities like the Breast
Cancer Foundation and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital to name a couple.
Each D'imorga Handbag design that we create would represent its own special
charity.·

MODELS

Named after the most famous Bandits, we are proud to introduce the NED KELLY and SALVATORE GIULIANO models:
NED KELLY EDITION                        
Edward “Ned” Kelly was seen as the Australian equivalent of Robin Hood. Born in 1854 he became a Bushranger at the age of 14 after his father was killed by police. 
 

His main source of income was bank robbery. He was eventually captured and hanged after a violent confrontation with police where he wore a homemade bendable metal plate armour and helmet. BÆNDIT in this shape reflects the roughness of Australia early pioneering bush life and the Kelly`s last stand inventiveness.
SALVATORE GIULIANO EDITIONSalvatore Giuliano was the original italian “peoples bandit”. He rose to prominence following the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943. Giuliano was the first bandit to be followed by mass media, mainly for his daring, good looks and theatrical flair. This notoriety caused great embarrassment to the italian police that had 2000 men deployed against him. BÆNDIT in this edition commemorates Giuliano’s style and charm even in the hardest of circumstances.





BÆNDIT STRUCTURE AND MATERIALS
BÆNDIT revolutionary patent pending structure and materials allows for a whole new eye wear experience.

FRAMES:



 
STRUCTURE
In new generation TR-90 polymer: lightweight, flexible and impact resistance. TR90 refered to as plastic titanium, a memory polymer material, BÆNDIT eyepiece frame is so light that it floats but also strong, with a resistance to deformation index of 620kg/cm2 and the ability to regain shape after deformation.
 
LENS
Custom S20 Revo lenses made specifically for BÆNDIT to work in the toughest of environments and filter out 100% of UVA / UVB / UVC. Made from Thermoplastic Polycarbonate composite for extra strength and durability.
 

TEMPLES & NOSE

CORE
BÆNDIT alloy, processed and engineered to reach exceptional reversible plasticity properties. Ductility and malleability performances allow the core of the temples and bridge to deform, hold position and move back to original when pressure is applied. This is further enhanced by flexibility of the silicon casing and the fact that it is bonded to the alloy core.
Additionally each temple and nose bridge piece is hand cut and 4 (temples) to 8 (nose) safety pins are hand welded to the main structure to work as a locking mechanism to the eye frame piece.
CASING
High Resistance Silicone-Rubber Elastomer cured and Injection molded with the alloy core to be permanently bonded. The molded Silicone casing provides the elastic capacity to follow the core in the deformation process and helps in the last 5% of returning to its original shape.
BOX
Made from recycled cardboard.

Risks & Challenges



We have spent over 12 months working with an array of professionals who helped bring BÆNDIT to the awesomeness they are now . Design Engineers, Patent Attorneys, Logistics and Sourcing Experts, Material Engineers and Production Experts have been fundamental in the creation of BÆNDIT.
Luckily everyone we talked to loved our idea and encouraged us to push forward. Working with our patent attorneys proved to be very time consuming, but necessary. BÆNDIT is patent pending.
Prototypes were designed and created, with incredible changes and improvements over time. Working testing samples are now fantastic and shooting samples almost have all the qualities the product you will get have. The greatest challenge was getting the plasticity of the temples and nose alloy core to work on tandem with the flexibility of the silicon casing and permanently bind the two for a perfect overall feel and function.

<p><strong>The QR code</strong></p>
<p>Invented in Japan by the Toyota subsidiary Denso Wave in 1994 to track vehicles during the manufacturing process, the QR Code is one of the most popular types of two-dimensional barcodes. Unfortunately, it's also one of the most boring and ugly things to take in.</p>
<p>Companies across the world have tried unsuccessfully to capitalize on QR codes as marketing tools. They know there's ""something there,"" just not exactly what it is.</p>
<p><strong>Why we took notice</strong></p>
<p>We were eating at a restaurant one day when we saw a Heinz ketchup bottle with a QR code on the back. Because we love technology and marketing, we decided to scan it, which only took us to its Facebook page. Obviously, the goal was to get new ""likes,"" but talk about anti-climatic. To us, it was like going into a state-of-the-art movie theater to see a still image. </p>
<p><strong>The problems with QR codes</strong></p>
<p>During that lunch we decided to make a list of all of the things that just weren't working as they related to QR codes and why they hadn't taken off in a bigger way. We know that they are on almost everything, but how often do you see people scanning them?</p>
<p>1. Not enough people have a QR reader app on their phone, or incentive to download one.</p>
<p>2. They're boring and ugly to look at and so two dimensional. Companies and people alike have tried all types of ways to vary the design, but since it needs to still be able to be scanned (and it's very finicky in the properties that need to be maintained in order to do so), at most you'll see the occasional rounded edges, maybe a limited contrast in colors, or a logo/image overlay. </p>
<p>3. If you can even get someone to scan one (like in the Heinz scenario), chances are, they'll never scan that again—primarily due to the content.</p>
<p>4. The QR code takes you to a very specific place and only that place. There's some reusable Qr codes, but they are cumbersome to work with and not very user-friendly. Why is this a problem?

<p><strong>The solution</strong></p>
<p>First we needed a name that involved making something your own, yet still tying in with the ""QR"" in QR code. After hundreds of names, we chose MIQROBREW.</p>
<p>Then we needed to not only create a QR code that would direct people to a website page in the making, but also make the QR code itself more appealing. We did this by creating The Cube—a three dimensional QR code that can still be read by QR readers.</p>
<p>Next we created an ultra-clean website (miqrobrew.com) that only served a very few purposes:</p>
<p>• Sell one shirt (in all sizes, mens and womens) that had The Cube on it as well as the line, ""This shirt changes all the time."" The shirts are $29.99 each.</p>
<p>• A blog page that the QR code actually directs to.</p>
<p>• A contact page where people can communicate with us directly and pay for a link to show for a given length of time on a pre-determined day for a small fee ($20—subject to approval [creative, interesting, entertaining, thought-provoking] as we don't want to ever run company ads).</p>
<p>• A Facebook page link where we want people to go and share their link ideas of where the shirts should send people to (facebook.com/miqrobrewlivingtee).</p>
<p>• A Twitter page link where every single scan that has been uploaded can be received via following us on Twitter (twitter.com/miqrobrew).</p>
<p>Finally, we added content. For months we've scoured the internet looking for images and videos that represent everything we found creative, interesting, entertaining, and though-provoking. Several times a day we will be posting only images and videos that represent those categories.

</div></div>","The QR code
Invented in Japan by the Toyota subsidiary Denso Wave in 1994 to track vehicles during the manufacturing process, the QR Code is one of the most popular types of two-dimensional barcodes. Unfortunately, it's also one of the most boring and ugly things to take in.
Companies across the world have tried unsuccessfully to capitalize on QR codes as marketing tools. They know there's ""something there,"" just not exactly what it is.
Why we took notice
We were eating at a restaurant one day when we saw a Heinz ketchup bottle with a QR code on the back. Because we love technology and marketing, we decided to scan it, which only took us to its Facebook page. Obviously, the goal was to get new ""likes,"" but talk about anti-climatic. To us, it was like going into a state-of-the-art movie theater to see a still image. 
The problems with QR codes
During that lunch we decided to make a list of all of the things that just weren't working as they related to QR codes and why they hadn't taken off in a bigger way. We know that they are on almost everything, but how often do you see people scanning them?
1. Not enough people have a QR reader app on their phone, or incentive to download one.
2. They're boring and ugly to look at and so two dimensional. Companies and people alike have tried all types of ways to vary the design, but since it needs to still be able to be scanned (and it's very finicky in the properties that need to be maintained in order to do so), at most you'll see the occasional rounded edges, maybe a limited contrast in colors, or a logo/image overlay. 
3. If you can even get someone to scan one (like in the Heinz scenario), chances are, they'll never scan that again—primarily due to the content.
4. The QR code takes you to a very specific place and only that place. There's some reusable Qr codes, but they are cumbersome to work with and not very user-friendly. Why is this a problem? What if you printed a thousand invitations to an event with that code and for some reason the destination of that code (i.e. the website it would be directed to) needed to change? Your code on the invitations would no longer be valid. 
5. The final, most pivotal thing that caught our attention, was that they were simply not fun. It's safe to say that 99% (don't hold us to that, just have a look for yourself) of QR Codes go back to the same company with the same theme. You'll always roughly know the content.
The challenge
To create a product that had a QR code on it that:
• always led to interesting and varying content
• never had to have the code changed
• intrigued people enough to want to download a QR reader app
• had an updated, more trendy version of the QR code that hadn't been done before
• could invite users to participate and WANT to participate
• was creative, interesting, entertaining, and thought-provoking
The solution
First we needed a name that involved making something your own, yet still tying in with the ""QR"" in QR code. After hundreds of names, we chose MIQROBREW.
Then we needed to not only create a QR code that would direct people to a website page in the making, but also make the QR code itself more appealing. We did this by creating The Cube—a three dimensional QR code that can still be read by QR readers.
Next we created an ultra-clean website (miqrobrew.com) that only served a very few purposes:
• Sell one shirt (in all sizes, mens and womens) that had The Cube on it as well as the line, ""This shirt changes all the time."" The shirts are $29.99 each.

• A Twitter page link where every single scan that has been uploaded can be received via following us on Twitter (twitter.com/miqrobrew).

BSpoked: ""Lets be honest, finding a great pair of shades without breaking the bank is nearly impossible. Elliot Havok Eyewear felt the same way and decided to be a part of the solution.""
GearHungry: ""Elliot Havok sunglasses, for instance, sport real Rosewood arms on spring-loaded hinges and 9 layer scratch-proof lenses with UV protection and a polarized core - features that typically come at a steep price.""

Elliot Havok sunglasses were designed to be practical, affordable, as well as fashionable. It promotes modern sophistication without compromising comfort by combining subtle, but distinguished styles in ergonomic wood and gloss/matte designs.

Designing Elliot Havok SmartShades

We felt the need to design a quality pair that is less mainstream plastic and more refined, as well as practical.

Utilizing aspects from classic designs and reinventing couture,We designed the first line of Elliot Havok.

Offering 3 Frame Colors
Your pledges on kickstarter will contribute to the production of 3 types of frames.
Each frame will retail at $109.00


Rogue - Matte Black w/ Polarized Lens

Prestige - Gloss Black w/ Polarized Lens

Architect - Gloss Black w/ Clear Lens for Prescription Use

Each pair will also include a 30 by 30 centimeter (about 12x12 in.) microfiber pocket square used to clean the lenses.
ErgoFit


Winged Temples to prevent slipping forward

Curved Contours to fit all heads

Rosewood Temple Arms to provide optimal durability and pliability

Unique Grain Patterns and etched logos for each pair

After numerous assessments on a variety of woods like birch, oak, and cherry, it was decided that rosewood had the most suitable strength, pliability, texture and grain patterns.
Taking these aspects into consideration, we engineered Ergofit temple arms that can be effectively worn on all heads.
9-layer Polarized UV Lenses
Some designer shades charge hundreds of dollars to manufacture plastic frames with polycarbonate lens that only prevent cracking, but Elliot Havok provides 9-layer polarized UV lens.

9-Layer Polarized UV Lens
These consist of :


2 Shock Absorbers - to prevent cracking or shattering of lenses 

2 Waterproof Anti-Scratch Layers - to maintain clear vision

4 UV Filters - to fully protect against harmful ultraviolet radiation

1 Polarized Core - to provide optimal contrast and glare reduction.
We join these parts with steel spring loaded hinges that outfit the sunglasses with ample durability and flex during wear.

Prestige Frames w/ Pocket Square


Rogue Frames w/ Pocket Square


Rogue Frames w/ Rosewood Temples

Production:

After numerous assessments on lumber, plastics, and lenses, we have finished designing and testing for a final prototype. We can now start production of the frames for the public with all of your help.

This is where indiegogo comes in. We need funding for manufacturing, packaging, and logistics. With your support, we can start large scale production of the frames, lenses, and temple arms.

She was a special lady, and despite her passing earlier this year, she still is, and always will be close to my heart.  I am launching MayMac to per sue my dreams, to per sue her dreams, and keep the legacy, talent, and spirit of Eunice May MacFadden alive.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p></p>

<p></p><p></p></div>","MayMac is a line of corsets, costumes, clothing and lingerie with a pin up flair.  MayMac will be debuting at The Viva Las Vegas Fashion show in April 2014.  I am asking for your support because the garments are sketched and patterned, but in order to produce enough product, I need some financial backing!  Your pledge will fund fabric, supplies (like zippers, thread, buttons, boning, etc) and production.  I have a lot of great rewards to offer for your pledges!  Everything from a one of a kind MayMac bag to exclusive items you can only get here!  Please consider making a pledge to MayMac and help give this small business the start that it needs!  Thank you! Check out our video for a snip it of MayMac!The Story Behind The Design...MayMac is a fashion line in honor of a woman who influenced me, inspired me, and taught me how to sew.  Eunice May MacFadden, or Grandma Eunie. She taught me to sew at a young age, encouraged my creativity and taught me that everything should be made with love.  Grandma Eunie always dreamed of being a fashion designer, to which she would called her line ""MayMac"", but always said she did not have the confidence to per sue it.  Growing up we made halloween costumes and dresses for my dolls, which surely influenced me to become a fashion and costume designer today! She was a special lady, and despite her passing earlier this year, she still is, and always will be close to my heart.  I am launching MayMac to per sue my dreams, to per sue her dreams, and keep the legacy, talent, and spirit of Eunice May MacFadden alive.

New business cards!We got a whole 2 pages in the Revolution Magazine! And an ad on the back cover! The article is an About Me and is quite inspiring :)  I was too excited to make myself look fancy for a photo!But..What's Our Style?MayMac is heavily influenced by a time when beauty was curvy & sexy, but classy, the music was from big bands with a variety of instruments and charming voices, and the TV was still in black and white.  We love the olden days!   MayMac will strap you into a modern revival of pin up shapewear, curve boasting pencil skirts, and colorful, flirty fabrics. Most of all, we aim to make every woman feel beautiful.  We cater to a variety of sizes and want all women to feel that they are sexy!Corsets, Curves and Costumes... Here at MayMac we focus on a few areas of garment design.  Not only do we enjoy street wear, but we LOVE lingerie!  Oh, and we LOVE corsets, and even more, combining the love for all of these into...costumes! Who ever wanted to stop playing dress up?!Check out some of the costumes we've made!""Wild for Pearls""The Wild For Pearls corset before it got wild! And, I'm sorry, but my baby girl Ava looks adorable in her pearls, so I couldn't leave her out!""Burlesque At Tiffany's""Carmen MirandaThe Black WidowBurlesque Zoo: PeacockBurlesque Zoo: TigerCorset in collaboration with Killustrate It Phantom of the OperaCleopatra as portrayed by Elizabeth Taylor in the Movie CleopatraJust for fun, we made these for an 80's prom. I can't help but share this. Mrs. ClausHow's It Made?Grandma Eunie always taught me that everything I made was special.  Today, this translates into every detail, consideration and alteration that is made on every garment.  Each costume is unique and well thought out, each corset and lingerie piece is ""test run"" and made sure to offer curves and comfort, and all street wear is carefully crafted.  Currently, every piece is made by me, in the MayMac Studio.  Eventually, we hope to be big enough that we will need to send our lingerie and street wear to be mass produced! In the USA of course! However, each costume and corset will still be made in the studio (because, well, its fun!).Any chance your going to Viva Las Vegas? Come see our debut at the Fashion Show! Friday, April 18th at 12pm.Keep up with us on Facebook! https://www.facebook.com/MaymacDesignStudios& Twitter @_MayMac_What We Need & What You GetBe A Part of Getting MayMac Started!By choosing to make a pledge to MayMac you are choosing to help fund a small business with BIG dreams!  We have been hard at work! Sewing, designing, patterning, supply shopping, doing photo shoots, networking and so much more preparing for the debut of the MayMac Collection at the fabulous Viva Las Vegas Fashion Show in April 2014.  But we are only one set of hands! (sometimes two when the man of the house gets trapped in the studio) and we need to make sure funding is set so the next few months can be spent working hard on production! We want to have samples for the show, but also stock available for purchase! Because, what good is it to look, if you can't touch (and buy) too?! MayMac is looking to raise $1000.00 to start production. Your funding can help! Here is how your pledges will be used:

Fabrics


Sewing Supplies (like zippers, thread, buttons)


Lingerie Making Supplies (Wire, Elastic, Straps, Garter Hooks, Snap Tape)

<p>We launched this campaign to get this product to market. Funds raised will allow us to have the machinery and molding made to produce our outer bag shells and our wireless charging base and to produce each item in larger quantities which will reduce our overall carbon footprint from shipping and waste. We have had our modular system, without the added technology, produced for the last two years. Our charging feature was created by an engineering team that boasts dozens of patents and published scientific articles. Our production partners (who also produce bags for luxury brands Valentino, Tosca Blu, Le Tanneur,  and more) are ready to go as soon as we give them the green light. All prototypes have been rigorously tested to ensure each element of the bag is functional - in other words, we are ready to produce your bag! </p>

<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p>Our handbags are made with ethical manufacturing procedures, including fair wages and safe working conditions. We strive to limit our carbon footprint to help preserve the environment. We use vegan materials that are low-waste. Our EVA compound is extremely durable, long-lasting, and recyclable. When possible, we also use post-consumer content for our inner bags and flaps.</p>
<p><strong>Long-lasting design</strong></p>
<p>EVA is not only extremely durable but it will hold up for decades. Our modular design also lets you switch styles as desired so you never have to buy a complete bag again, this reduces waste and encourages us to use our products for longer.</p>
<p><strong>Reusability and recyclability</strong></p>
<p>We have a take-back program so all recycled EVA shells can be repurposed. Our favorite reuse of EVA is making squishy-soft playground mats.</p>
<p><strong>Vegan</strong></p>
<p>With ethical and environmentally sound materials now readily available, Evolution has made the commitment to only produce vegan products. You can feel confident that any product you purchase from us will not contain animal products.</p>

With ethical and environmentally sound materials now readily available, Evolution has made the commitment to only produce vegan products. You can feel confident that any product you purchase from us will not contain animal products.

That being said, we’re confident in our ability to produce the Evolution Smart Bag and have taken all the necessary measures to bring this project to life. We have a highly qualified team and have partnered with leading manufacturing and fulfillment companies around the world. We just need your help to bring everything to fruition. Don’t worry, we’re completely prepared to bring the Evolution Smart Bag to you, and we have the manpower to make it happen, but if anything comes up along the way, you’ll be the first to know - we promise.

<h2>Aloha Dear Reader,</h2>
<p>You're about to discover the coziest, classiest, Eco-friendliest robe you've never worn... yet!</p>
<p>Welcome to Imbued!</p>
<p>Your purchase of an Imbued robe will fund the manufacturing of your robe— which is also a cloak for Imbued's commitment to <b>give back </b>a portion of proceeds to Hawaii non-profits.</p>
<p>Here's the story...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561531088/vuoecdl1ni2rdrj1t4cf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>Join the Fashion Revolution</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561531984/thqzdol8ie2agnzpp8cm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By supporting Imbued, <strong>you'll be contributing</strong> to the <strong>#fashionrevolution,</strong> a.k.a the Slow Fashion Movement: A mindful approach to fashion, which considers environmentally friendly and humane processes in clothing manufacturing.</p>
<p>Each Imbued robe is a sustainably made, premium-quality, long-lasting garment imbued with integrity and values.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Clear Choice: Sustainably Certified Modal Fabric</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561532596/olm0kzm67md2r7vqxgsw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Imbued robes are made with Modal fabric derived from beech trees, a <strong>low-water demand</strong> tree that is <strong>pesticide free</strong> + <strong>renewable</strong> + <strong>biodegradable.</strong></p>
<p>﻿Imbued's Tencel Modal fabric is <a href=""http://www.lenzing.com/sustainability/product-benefits/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Lenzing certified</strong></a>— which verifies that the fabric was made with wood harvested through sustainable forestry methods.</p>
<p>Also, Imbued's Tencel Modal fabric is certified by <a href=""http://www.oeko-tex.com/en/business/certifications_and_services/ots_100/ots_100_start.xhtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>OEKO-TEX Standard 100</strong></a>—a third party system that tests for harmful substances during every stage of production. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why Certification Matters</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561532331/ua0z4wpg9fz7vgwkq0gw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Inexpensive Modal exists, but Imbued chooses not to use it...</p>
<p>Because if the Modal is not Lenzing certified then it poses a <strong>high risk</strong> that Indonesian rainforests were slashed and burned to grow the beech trees.</p>
<p>And without the OEKO-TEX STANDARD 100 certification, the Modal fabric could potentially be <strong>laden with chemicals</strong> that pose a risk to your health and the health of the planet. </p>

<h2>The Difference Is In The Details: Italian Olive Wood Buttons</h2>

<p>That's why the button that fastens your robe to the curves of your body, is hand-carved from <strong>Italian Olive Wood.</strong></p>
<p>Shell buttons were the first choice because they're beautiful, ....and hey, Imbued was born in Hawaii!  But doing a deeper-dive, it was discovered that shell buttons are often unsustainably cultivated.</p>
<p>Of course, plastic buttons would be cheaper, but we're swimming in a sea of plastic that <strong>isn't biodegradable.</strong></p>

<p>Your garment hangtag will grow Chamomile!</p>
<p>Wait, ...what?</p>
<p>Yep... the hangtag on your robe is <strong>handmade paper</strong> made from 100% recycled ingredients, and it's embedded with Chamomile seeds!</p>
<p>Yes; plant your hangtag, and help it grow!</p>
<p>Also, unlike most ""hangtags"" these use no chemicals, dyes or additives, and are made one sheet-at-a-time by artisans in sunny San Diego, CA. </p>

<p>But that's not all!...</p>
<p>The ""care"" label on the inside of your robe is a heat transfer label, which means it's a <strong>tagless tag</strong> that requires no additional fabric!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>From Imbued's Heart to Your Door with Environmentally Thoughtful Packaging </h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561534300/v5t1dafilttajriuyjzu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Your Imbued robe will arrive at your door in a <strong>biodegradable apparel mailer</strong> made from 100% recycled paper, developed as a strong, flexible, plastic-free way to ship garments.</p>

You're about to discover the coziest, classiest, Eco-friendliest robe you've never worn... yet!
Welcome to Imbued!
Your purchase of an Imbued robe will fund the manufacturing of your robe— which is also a cloak for Imbued's commitment to give back a portion of proceeds to Hawaii non-profits.
Here's the story...

 
Join the Fashion Revolution

By supporting Imbued, you'll be contributing to the #fashionrevolution, a.k.a the Slow Fashion Movement: A mindful approach to fashion, which considers environmentally friendly and humane processes in clothing manufacturing.
Each Imbued robe is a sustainably made, premium-quality, long-lasting garment imbued with integrity and values.
 
The Clear Choice: Sustainably Certified Modal Fabric

Imbued robes are made with Modal fabric derived from beech trees, a low-water demand tree that is pesticide free + renewable + biodegradable.
﻿Imbued's Tencel Modal fabric is Lenzing certified— which verifies that the fabric was made with wood harvested through sustainable forestry methods.
Also, Imbued's Tencel Modal fabric is certified by OEKO-TEX Standard 100—a third party system that tests for harmful substances during every stage of production. 
 
Why Certification Matters

Inexpensive Modal exists, but Imbued chooses not to use it...
Because if the Modal is not Lenzing certified then it poses a high risk that Indonesian rainforests were slashed and burned to grow the beech trees.
And without the OEKO-TEX STANDARD 100 certification, the Modal fabric could potentially be laden with chemicals that pose a risk to your health and the health of the planet.

The Difference Is In The Details: Italian Olive Wood Buttons

That's why the button that fastens your robe to the curves of your body, is hand-carved from Italian Olive Wood.
Shell buttons were the first choice because they're beautiful, ....and hey, Imbued was born in Hawaii!  But doing a deeper-dive, it was discovered that shell buttons are often unsustainably cultivated.
Of course, plastic buttons would be cheaper, but we're swimming in a sea of plastic that isn't biodegradable.

Consciously Created Labels That Grow Chamomile Flowers!

Your garment hangtag will grow Chamomile!
Wait, ...what?
Yep... the hangtag on your robe is handmade paper made from 100% recycled ingredients, and it's embedded with Chamomile seeds!
Yes; plant your hangtag, and help it grow!
Also, unlike most ""hangtags"" these use no chemicals, dyes or additives, and are made one sheet-at-a-time by artisans in sunny San Diego, CA. 
For more information click here.
But that's not all!...
The ""care"" label on the inside of your robe is a heat transfer label, which means it's a tagless tag that requires no additional fabric!
 
From Imbued's Heart to Your Door with Environmentally Thoughtful Packaging 

Your Imbued robe will arrive at your door in a biodegradable apparel mailer made from 100% recycled paper, developed as a strong, flexible, plastic-free way to ship garments.
If that isn't Eco-friendly enough...
even Imbued's postage label is the world's most sustainable sticker option—a Zero Waste label that is 100% curbside recyclable!

Ethically Made in the U.S.A.

Equal to Imbued's environmental commitment is a commitment to the ethical treatment of workers.
Which is why Imbued robes are being sewn at a Los Angeles sew factory, 9B Apparel which has a twenty-year reputation for maintaining ethical and healthy working conditions, right here in the U.S.A!
Using this U.S. based sew factory allows you the consumer to get a 1st-hand glimpse into production.
How?
Through Imbued's newsletter, and social media updates where I'll share the process as it unfolds, providing ethical transparency and the support of U.S. jobs.

Benefiting The Future of a Non-profit

Every time Imbued launches an apparel collection, 5% of the proceeds will be donated to a chosen non-profit.
For this 1st collection Imbued has selected a local Kauai based organization called Kauai Animal Education Center or KAEC.
KAEC, is an animal rescue farm, an education center for all ages, a developing cultural space and a supportive place for people recovering from trauma and addiction.

So Here's The Deal...

Imbued robes are a limited-edition collection through this campaign. 
Funding proceeds will be used to produce your robe…mahalo for your patience.
No extra inventory will be available after the production is finished!
5% of Imbued's proceeds will go to a Kauai non-profit...another 5% will go towards Indiegogo's platform fee and 2.9% towards a transaction handling fee. 
Lastly, a BIG thank you, for sharing with friends, family, and followers, that you've backed this project!  You can post on social media, send texts or emails by saying; ""I just backed @Imbued.co on @Indiegogo! Check out this awesome project: https://igg.me/at/imbued"" 

 
Why Imbued crowdfunded?  
Crowdfunding is an excellent choice to share Imbued's story, grow a community around the Slow Fashion Movement, test the market and raise funds to launch a dream.

Risks and Challenges
Please allow a 3 month timeline for production. I appreciate your understanding! Excellent quality takes time. It's important to note that if any minor changes occur during the production process it will be well communicated with backers, i.e. if the fabric is on backorder and/or if another fabric color option will be offered.
 
Return Policy
Imbued is all about fair business practices and aiming to please.  If expectations aren't met when your robes arrives and you wish to return it...no problem!  Please mail your robe back to Imbued within 30 days from the shipment date and you will be given a full refund.  Return shipping cost will be your responsibility.  
 
Shipping
As much as we've all become accustomed to free shipping, Imbued is just a ""wee babe"" in the big world of business.  Eliminating shipping costs for future collections is in the process. Mahalo for your understanding!

<p>In launching an eco-minded clothing brand the effort put into the brand DNA and company culture has equal standing with the effort put into the design/ manufacture of the product itself.</p>
<p>At Good Shirt the company ethos and clothing design are based around a simple yet profound fact that “The fashion industry is the second largest polluter in the world.</p>
<p>So are we going to be another clothing company that shamelessly plays their part in the polluting of our planet?, or are we going to be a sustainable company that makes a conscious effort in playing a role in restoring a balance in the natural world, and reducing mankind's impact on the environment?</p>
<p>It’s a no brainer really, we're taking the sustainable route. In doing so we'll follow in the footsteps of companies like legendary outdoors company Patagonia, whose light shines brightest of all clothing companies as a sustainable producer and environmentally aware company and has no doubt inspired many like us to take this less trodden but ultimately the more rewarding path.  </p>

<p>Collaboration is another integral component of our Brand DNA and in launching Good Shirt Collab Tees with an eclectic collection of Tee Print art as chosen by the “Dream Team” of Collaborating Photographers we're kicking things of in the positive way we plan to continue.</p>
<p>The Travel &amp; Adventure theme of our first Collab really sets the tone, is a big part of what we love and insync with the eco-active range we’re launching with.</p>
<p>Between them this “Dream Team” of Photographers have clocked some serious miles both in the air and on the ground, and so we celebrate this world we love in all it’s diversity through their awesome range of photographic prints on our Limited Edition Good Shirts Collab Tees, the QAD Pro Camera Straps &amp; the Slim Jim Minimalist Wallets.</p>

<p>As a sustainable/ eco-minded company Good Shirt will also actively champion environmental causes that we are passionate about.</p>
<p>At Good Shirt we’re kicking off our first Corporate Social Responsibility initiative with Conservation Photographer/ Eco Warrior Paul Hilton's Collab Tees.</p>

<div>While Good Shirt is a new brand, I have been involved in the fashion industry for over 17 years and have long term working relationships with manufacturing partners who have been in the business of garment manufacturing for over 25 years so together we are well versed in getting a quality product produced and working to a fixed delivery timeline.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Manufacturer we’ve worked with for the sampling and our upcoming production of the Good Shirt range, is a leading edge sustainable manufacturer, working with global brands such as Arc'teryx, The North Face, Salomon, so not our first rodeo when it comes to producing high quality product delivered to a timeline.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With the completion of the Good Shirt Collab Indiegogo Launch, the first thing we'll do is send you the order survey form where you can select the Style/ Size/ Colourway/ Print Art based on the selected ""Perk"" you ordered and return the completed form to us.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then we're into the pre-production/ production phase and with production completed  the logistics and delivery of your order directly to your door.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Of course if for any reason there is a delay in production we will be transparent and update you with this information together with the revised delivery schedule. We have already built in a time buffer to allow for unforeseen delay and not disrupt our delivery schedule so we're not expecting any delay to the delivery schedule, simply our style to plan for all eventualities. </div>

</div></div>","In launching an eco-minded clothing brand the effort put into the brand DNA and company culture has equal standing with the effort put into the design/ manufacture of the product itself.
At Good Shirt the company ethos and clothing design are based around a simple yet profound fact that “The fashion industry is the second largest polluter in the world.
So are we going to be another clothing company that shamelessly plays their part in the polluting of our planet?, or are we going to be a sustainable company that makes a conscious effort in playing a role in restoring a balance in the natural world, and reducing mankind's impact on the environment?
It’s a no brainer really, we're taking the sustainable route. In doing so we'll follow in the footsteps of companies like legendary outdoors company Patagonia, whose light shines brightest of all clothing companies as a sustainable producer and environmentally aware company and has no doubt inspired many like us to take this less trodden but ultimately the more rewarding path.  


Collaboration is another integral component of our Brand DNA and in launching Good Shirt Collab Tees with an eclectic collection of Tee Print art as chosen by the “Dream Team” of Collaborating Photographers we're kicking things of in the positive way we plan to continue.
The Travel & Adventure theme of our first Collab really sets the tone, is a big part of what we love and insync with the eco-active range we’re launching with.
Between them this “Dream Team” of Photographers have clocked some serious miles both in the air and on the ground, and so we celebrate this world we love in all it’s diversity through their awesome range of photographic prints on our Limited Edition Good Shirts Collab Tees, the QAD Pro Camera Straps & the Slim Jim Minimalist Wallets.
With more good stuff to come, follow our journey and get involved, who knows we may be collaborating with you in the future.  


Prior to launching we had a supporter based ""Design Refine"" on the Collab Tee Print Art, the votes are being tallied so we'll update this Lookbook with the Tee Print Art deemed most popular by you our supporters.  
 

Got some sweeeet images of your own you'd like to see on a Collab Tee, Pre-order the ""One of a Kind"" Perk and we'll work with you to create the Tee Print Art.
 


Our low profile Slim Jim Minimalist Wallets from the GS eco-minded accessory range are great for carrying cash & cards in your front pocket, the compact size making them ultimately more comfortable and less likely to be pickpocketed when travelling than a regular wallet.


The Dream Teams Collab Art featured on the range of Slim Jim Minimalist Wallets  sure to add some verve to your day. 

​Our Patent Pending Quick Attach / Detach Camera Strap enables you to remove or attach the QAD Pro from your camera body in seconds. ART meets Functional Design with the verve of the images as supplied by the ""Dream Team"" of Collab Artists whose work features on the QAD PRO's neck/ shoulder section.


Good Shirt's ""Adventurers Club"", is more of a Privilege Card than your standard loyalty card.
With Good Shirt's Eco-minded approach to business and it's relationship to the Natural World through our sustainable product and collaborative model, our omni-channel sales places a great emphasis on  B2B sales with our Partner Clients businesses operating in the Adventure Tourism Experiences  space. Given that these businesses spend their days providing their guests with experiences based in the outdoors, their duty of care to the Natural World in which their respective businesses operate is very high, so a good synergy with our stated goals and range of eco-savvy goods. 
Through our Adventurers Club, in addition to stocking GS Collab Tees, our B2B Client Partners may choose to offer seasonal deals to GoodShirt Adventure Club cardholders.
Every purchase of a Good Shirt Collab Tee or Accessories comes with a FREE GS Adventurers Club card for you to enjoy special offers from our Partner Clients when in season. Think Bike Tours, Diving, Stand Up Paddle Boarding, Swimming with Whale Sharks, Ballooning, Vineyard Tours, Sky Diving, Kayaking ........ and so the list goes on. 
Good Shirt's Free digital e-zine ""Good Stuff""  hosted on issuu, is well, packed full of good stuff! Interviews with Collaborating Artists, Photo Galleries, Features on Environmental Issues that resonate with us. 
Together with  travel stories which may feature our Partner Clients businesses  we'll add to the mix articles on music, food and other topics of interest to keep things fresh. Stay tuned the 1st issuu of Good Stuff dropping later this week.
  

 
 

With all of the time, effort and monies put into the developing Good Shirt as an eco-savvy company has been self funded to this point, Indiegogo is a great platform to launch our brand on introducing Good Shirt to the world.
We can introduce ourselves to you and as a visitor/ supporter of our launch, and you get a look behind the scenes and learn more about Good Shirt as a responsible brand.
If you like what you see, as way of thanking you for your support we’ve got some special Indiegogo pricing for the pre-order perks so a great way to kick things off for both ourselves, and our supporters.  
Going into our first production run of Good Shirt range with your help, the pre-orders made on Indiegogo will help us to reach the minimum order quantities required for production, with a successful campaign resulting in zero waste with all goods being made to order directly by you the end user.
With our collaborative model, for the launch we’re also giving you the option to see your own work on a Good Shirt through our “One of a Kind” pre-order perk, and so engaging with our supporters not only online but also in creating some unique tee print art together with you.
More details about all the good things we’ve been able to pack into the humble tee are outlined here, but if there’s anything specific you would like to ask feel free to reach out. 


As a sustainable/ eco-minded company Good Shirt will also actively champion environmental causes that we are passionate about.
At Good Shirt we’re kicking off our first Corporate Social Responsibility initiative with Conservation Photographer/ Eco Warrior Paul Hilton's Collab Tees.
One of these Collab Tees featuring the hashtag #SaveLeuserEcosystem designed to raise awareness of the environmental travesty that is taking place there with large scale industrial development for palm oil, pulp and paper plantations and mining which threaten the entire ecosystem.
Paul together with other committed individuals and organisations are on a mission to help preserve this the most bio diverse region in the world and home to the Sumatran Tiger, Sumatran Elephant, Sumatran Rhino and the Orangutang to name just a few of the Leuser Ecosystems inhabitants that are being pushed to the brink of extinction.
So a portion of our profit from sale of GS Collab Tees & Accessories will be donated to help with the ongoing funding of an Elephant Patrol unit operating in the Leuser Ecosystem which is structured to mitigate the human/ wildlife conflict occurring as a result of the loss of their natural habitat.
Please Note:  With the structure of our Collab Model, it doesn’t matter which Good Shirt product you buy from the entire range, Good Shirt will be donating regardless.

Some pieces I could wear once and it fell apart or had shrunken significantly after one washing, other pieces' measurements were extremely off (read: a size S fitted as an XXL, no joke). <br/>What I was missing was quality clothing in accurate sizes (following 1 size guide) that's stylish, comfortable and affordable at the same time. Oh, and preferably made of more natural fabrics (away with those synthetic fabrics, no more wearing plastic!), so it's ideal for me and other women while on the go or traveling as well as better for the environment and our future generations.<br/>This is how the idea of creating my own clothing collection was born. </p><p>Sololu's mission is to bring value to the world by providing high-quality, comfortable, stylish and affordable clothing that contributes to a better everyday life, whether at home or abroad.</p><p>With your help in contributing any amount or pre-ordering one or more of the products I'm offering through this Indiegogo campaign (see the collection below), I will be able to have the clothing created in bulk and I'll be able to add even more designs that include all those characteristics I was missing. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497381857/ijzionpy9wdeiyzldt1f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496876753/rbax6jfgrg3qhutkykpe.png"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498770365/q3cmogsnalke0bqssfmt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493643961/ulhuhyj0cagdooyd3wwu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>I myself travel on a regular basis to different places all over the world. The first collection is based on the clothing styles and pieces I love to bring on my own travels and is handmade in an ethical work environment in Bali, Indonesia. It consists of 10 clothing designs, 1 sarong and 1 bag that can be worn year-round and mixed and matched together easily. </p><p>Quality is the most important to me – I want to focus on clothing designs that last, rather than clothing designs that need to be thrown out within a year of purchasing them. As I wanted to stay away from synthetic fabrics, I decided to use more natural fabrics – also because natural fabrics are breathable, which is ideal for travel. The characteristics of the fabrics I use for the clothing are soft, lightweight, breathable and biodegradable. All of the pieces are pre-washed to make sure they all maintain their original measurements as much as possible after washing.</p><p>The plan is to create and add new styles to the collection on a regular basis after the Indiegogo campaign has ended.

After a study in visual merchandising, interior design/styling and fashion styling, I moved with my family from the Netherlands to Canada in 2011 to start a new life. It has always been a dream to start my own fashion brand, so after some years of working in Canada and traveling through Asia, I decided to go for it. </p><p>My adventurous spirit has not only helped cause an emigration with my family from the Netherlands to Canada, it has also led me to places all over the world and it helps me to live life to the fullest by trying new things and taking risks – stepping outside of my comfort zone. From living and working in Italy to hiking the Himalayas in Nepal and from kiteboarding in Mexico to skiing in the Alps, I've experienced it and am grateful for it! However, there’s still so much more to discover and experience.

I've been able to build a good relationship with my manufacturer in Bali, Indonesia over this past year and am confident that the clothing can be finished in July 2017. However, if my goal gets exceeded and I have to increase the bulk order quantity, delays may occur. Of course, I will make sure to keep you updated about the entire process.</p></div>","About two years ago, I became so frustrated after having received poor quality clothing over and over again that I had ordered online. Some pieces I could wear once and it fell apart or had shrunken significantly after one washing, other pieces' measurements were extremely off (read: a size S fitted as an XXL, no joke). What I was missing was quality clothing in accurate sizes (following 1 size guide) that's stylish, comfortable and affordable at the same time. Oh, and preferably made of more natural fabrics (away with those synthetic fabrics, no more wearing plastic!), so it's ideal for me and other women while on the go or traveling as well as better for the environment and our future generations.This is how the idea of creating my own clothing collection was born. Sololu's mission is to bring value to the world by providing high-quality, comfortable, stylish and affordable clothing that contributes to a better everyday life, whether at home or abroad.With your help in contributing any amount or pre-ordering one or more of the products I'm offering through this Indiegogo campaign (see the collection below), I will be able to have the clothing created in bulk and I'll be able to add even more designs that include all those characteristics I was missing.   I myself travel on a regular basis to different places all over the world. The first collection is based on the clothing styles and pieces I love to bring on my own travels and is handmade in an ethical work environment in Bali, Indonesia. It consists of 10 clothing designs, 1 sarong and 1 bag that can be worn year-round and mixed and matched together easily. Quality is the most important to me – I want to focus on clothing designs that last, rather than clothing designs that need to be thrown out within a year of purchasing them. As I wanted to stay away from synthetic fabrics, I decided to use more natural fabrics – also because natural fabrics are breathable, which is ideal for travel. The characteristics of the fabrics I use for the clothing are soft, lightweight, breathable and biodegradable. All of the pieces are pre-washed to make sure they all maintain their original measurements as much as possible after washing.The plan is to create and add new styles to the collection on a regular basis after the Indiegogo campaign has ended. I aim to offer a large range of seasonless, stylish pieces that make it easy for you to create outfits you feel most confident in – year-round.Here below you can find all the details of each piece in the collection. All 10 clothing designs will be available in the sizes: XS, S, M, L and XL. The preferred size can be selected when you check out. For measurements, please refer to the ""Size Guide"" section further down.  The Sololu jute tote bag is made of jute material and is the perfect tote to bring to the beach, markets or anywhere else. It is cotton lined, lightweight, sturdy and has our logo + website printed on one side. Measurements: 40cm x 35cm x 10cm  //  15.8"" x 13.8"" x 3.9"" (LxHxD)  The white strapless top comes with a neck tie/choker and looks amazing on our shorts, skirt, pants and wide leg pants (designs 04, 07, 09 and 11, all below).

Measurements should be taken directly on your body.Bust: Measure your chest over the fullest part of your bust while wearing a bra that fits.Waist: Measure your waist at the narrowest point.Hips: Your hips measurement should be measured around the fullest part of your hips.If the item you've ordered doesn't fit right, you will have 14 days from the receipt of the order to contact me at hello@sololu.com to request an exchange and send back the item. Once I've received your item, I will send you the right size (I can assist you with deciding on the right size). Shipping costs for an exchange will be your responsibility. As the Handwoven Bracelets and Sarongs have been made already, these can be shipped out right after the campaign ends. The Jute Tote Bags and clothing are expected to be shipped out in August 2017. Sololu is founded and started by me, Rosanne Hertogh, out of my passion for traveling and style. After a study in visual merchandising, interior design/styling and fashion styling, I moved with my family from the Netherlands to Canada in 2011 to start a new life. It has always been a dream to start my own fashion brand, so after some years of working in Canada and traveling through Asia, I decided to go for it. My adventurous spirit has not only helped cause an emigration with my family from the Netherlands to Canada, it has also led me to places all over the world and it helps me to live life to the fullest by trying new things and taking risks – stepping outside of my comfort zone. From living and working in Italy to hiking the Himalayas in Nepal and from kiteboarding in Mexico to skiing in the Alps, I've experienced it and am grateful for it! However, there’s still so much more to discover and experience. Exploring the world and enjoying its beauty will never get old, it makes me feel most alive.Sololu is a reflection of my personal style and my ideal lifestyle – being wherever you’re happy, doing whatever makes you happy and sharing this with whoever makes you happy. You are the key to my success. I would greatly appreciate it if you could spread the word and share my campaign. You can also follow Sololu on social media – the social media buttons below will send you to Sololu's profile on each platform, or subscribe to the Sololu newsletters at the bottom of my website www.sololu.com.  Thank you so much for your support and for being a part of this journey!                      Where will you ship from?All orders will ship from Ontario, Canada.Do you ship worldwide?Yes, orders within Canada will be shipped for $4 - $25, order to the USA will be shipped for $6 - $30 and international orders will be shipped for $10 - $60 depending on your selection and the weight of the products.When can I expect my order to arrive?All orders will ship within 1-8 weeks from the last day of the campaign. Shipping within Canada should take 2-9 days from the date of shipment. Shipping to the USA should take 4-8 days from the date of the shipment and shipping internationally should take 6-14 days from the date of the shipment. Does shipping include tracking?All Canada + USA orders will include tracking. All international orders don't have tracking included, as I want to keep shipping costs as low as possible for you. International shipping that includes tracking, is often double in cost. If you are willing to pay for shipping that includes tracking, please email me at hello@sololu.com.Contributors living outside of Canada will be responsible for the charges of duties and import taxes. These are charged once the package reaches its destination country and vary from country to country. They will not be included in the cost of shipping. You may contact your local customs office for further information related to customs charges.What if I purchased the wrong size?If the item you've ordered doesn't fit right, you will have 14 days from the receipt of the order to contact me to request an exchange and send back the item. Once I've received your item, I will send you the right size. Shipping costs for an exchange will be your responsibility. Please, make sure to check the size guide before placing an order.Is there a return policy?As I use the funding from Indiegogo to get the bulk production started (to make the clothing collection available to everyone around the globe), I won’t be able to accept returns.What if an item is not the color I thought it was?Please keep in mind that due to different computer monitors and display settings the actual product's colors may vary slightly from the colors in the product photos. I have made every effort to display the colors and images of the products as accurately as possible. However, I cannot guarantee that your computer monitor's screen displays the colors accurately. Is there a physical Sololu store I can visit?At this time Sololu is exclusively based online at www.sololu.com. The clothing is currently only available on Indiegogo.  If you have any other questions, please email me at hello@sololu.com. I've worked on my clothing collection for almost two years, perfecting it and making sure it's exactly how I want it to be. I've been able to build a good relationship with my manufacturer in Bali, Indonesia over this past year and am confident that the clothing can be finished in July 2017. However, if my goal gets exceeded and I have to increase the bulk order quantity, delays may occur. Of course, I will make sure to keep you updated about the entire process.",47.0,0,"1 Campaign

Every time you purchase a piece of clothing from Les Sublimes, we pay it forward by supporting 1-month of education for a young girl in need.

We make people proud of the clothes they wear and the choices they make, proud that each decision can make a net-positive contribution to our natural surroundings, and demonstrate a new way of doing business for a collective future.</p>
<p>We know that a for-profit business with purpose can change people’s lives. Every time you shop Les Sublimes, you demand to see a new world. A world of beauty, mutual respect and integrity. That is what it means to be Sublimes.</p>
<p> </p> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A RESPONSIBLE COMPANY</h3> <p>We believe that integrity is just as important as style, price, quality and convenience. That’s why honesty and sustainability are integrated into every aspect of our business - from design and manufacturing, to killer customer service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Availability &amp; Accessibility</b></p>
<p>By engaging directly with our proud supporters online and working outside the traditional industry model, we are able to make sustainable products available to so many more people, at a much more affordable price. And that means that the social and environmental benefits of sustainable products can have a larger impact on the world around us. So much better, right?</p> <p><strong>Transparent Production</strong></p>
<p>We believe that you have a right to know exactly where the products you love come from and how they are produced. As a responsible company, being transparent holds us accountable to everyone connected with our brand. But it also gives you the freedom to select only the best products available.</p> <p><strong>The Atelier</strong></p>
<p><i>Confection Pérard in Renaison, France</i></p>

<p>It took us 6 months to find the perfect manufacturing partner to launch our Made in France collection. Confection Pérard is a small town atelier of master craftspeople specialized in making high quality knitwear. A 2nd-generation family business run by Thierry and Madame Pérard (mother + son), the atelier is one of the few surviving garment producers in the region. They credit their survival to their ethical values. Confection Pérard invests in training employees with a wide skill base, offers a flexible work schedule and guarantees high workplace standards. Many of their sewers have been with the company for over 20 years.</p>

<p> </p> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</h3> <p>We are asking for your support to order our first rolls of sustainable fabric! To make this first order a reality, we are raising € 10,000.</p>
<p>Fabric suppliers typically apply a 50% surcharge to smaller orders, making it impossible for us to maintain our affordable pricing and still earn a profit. By ordering our fabrics in bulk, we are able to get them at a much better price. And by selling our pieces directly to you online, we eliminate rent, middlemen and wholesale markups. Then we pass these savings on to you! That's how we can sell our clothes at between 25%-40% of the price of the luxury brands. Without any compromise.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">STRETCH GOALS</h3> <p>Starting small doesn’t mean we can't dream big. Here are some of the things we are currently working on:</p>
<p>If we surpass our target of € 10,000<b>, </b>we will re-invest the additional funds into growing Les Sublimes, adding 2 additional colors (grey and navy) and 5 new styles to our Made in France Collection.  We have already begun sourcing other luxurious, sustainable fabrics to add to our offering, including French linen, Peruvian organic pima cotton and cruelty-free cashmere from nomad communities in Mongolia.</p>
<p>Staying true to our worldly roots, we are also planning to expand our network of manufacturing partners outside of France so that we can incorporate more of the incredible craftsmanship found all over the world. Our underlying motivation is to share a fair and honest social production model that breaks from traditional textile industry practices. </p> <p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3> <p>We've spent over a year planning our first collection and Indiegogo launch because we want to make sure that we get everything just right!</p>
<p>Production Partner: We've visited our knitwear manufacturer in person to inspect their facility, meet their employees and review every single detail of their manufacturing process. With over 45 years of experience, we have full confidence in our little atelier and can tell you that they are just as excited about our project as we are.</p>
<p>Ship date:  We've built in extra time for production and are confident we'll ship by the estimated dates, but there is always a small chance that things will take longer than planned. We'll keep you updated if anything changes :)</p>
<p>Collection Items:  We have worked back and forth for 6 months with our sample and pattern makers to get the fit of our styles perfect and to ensure that everything is done to the highest quality and comfort standards.</p>
<p>Our samples are production ready and our factory is simply waiting for us to place our first Les Sublimes order! We don't anticipate any problems, but should any hiccups arise, we'll keep you updated and in the loop on any new timelines.</p>

<h3>SIX MOTS POUR DEFINIR LES SUBLIMES</h3> <div align=""left"">
<h4>1. Style</h4>
<p>En recréant nos essentiels favoris avec une coupe parfaite, nous infusons les tendances modernes avec un esthétisme féminin et chic-nonchalant.</p>
</div>
<h4 style=""text-align: left;"">2. Luxe</h4>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Nous sélectionnons des matières de grande qualité avec un confort incroyable, doux et facile à porter. Puis nous les confectionnons en France pour bénéficier du savoir-faire français, donnant naissance à des modèles bien pensés et intemporels.</p>
<h4 style=""text-align: left;"">3. Prix abordable</h4>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">100% en ligne et sans intermédiaire, ce modèle nous permet de proposer nos produits de qualité luxe à prix abordable : environ 40% du prix pratiqué par des maisons de luxe.</p>
<h4 style=""text-align: left;"">4. Faible impact environnemental</h4>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">La réduction des impacts environnementaux de nos produits est notre priorité. La collection est réalisée à partir de matières premières naturelles, et transformées en utilisant des technologies de pointes qui réduisent la consommation d’eau et d’énergie, favorisent la réutilisation des déchets et préservent l’écosystème local.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<h4 style=""text-align: left;"">5. Juste traitement</h4>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Les artisans et ouvriers ayant contribué à fabriquer nos produits reçoivent un salaire décent et bénéficient des droits fondamentaux au travail. Nous comptons exporter ce modèle social engagé vers nos futurs partenaires étrangers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h4 style=""text-align: left;""><strong>6. Espoir</strong></h4>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Nous souhaitons apporter des solutions permanentes aux travailleurs de l’industrie du textile, avec des bons emplois qui briseraient la transmission de la pauvreté.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""color:#44c0b6;"">NOUS PENSONS QUE LES FILLES SONT LA SOLUTION POUR METTRE FIN A LA PAUVRETÉ DANS LE MONDE.</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>En tant qu’entrepreneuses, citoyennes du monde et innovatrices sociales, nous croyons que toutes les femmes ont les mêmes droits à la liberté et au bonheur dont nous sommes heureuses de proclamer. Les femmes sont une grande solution contre la pauvreté dans le monde. </p>
<p>Une fille qui termine son parcours scolaire a meilleure chance d’éviter une grossesse adolescente, trouver un emploi, contribuer financièrement au foyer, gagner le respect de ses partenaires et de sa communauté. Ainsi elle brise le cercle de la pauvreté.</p>
<p>Chaque fois que vous achetez une pièce chez Les Sublimes, nous nous engageons à financer un mois d’école à une jeune fille au Kenya et au Népal, à travers des ONG locales.

<h4>Lenzing Modal</h4>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Le modal que nous utilisons est réalisé à base de pulpe de bois de hêtre, issu de forêts autrichiennes certifiées. La pulpe est traitée par la très innovante entreprise autrichienne Lenzing qui utilise un procédé peu gourmand en énergie et eau, et dont les substances chimiques sont recyclées à 95%. Le tout a lieu en Autriche. Cette fibre est ensuite tricotée par une entreprise autrichienne. </p>
<p>Certifié  OekoTex Standard 100<span style=""font-size: 12px;"">.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 12px;""> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p> <h4>Coton bio certifié GOTS</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>Le coton utilisé chez Les Sublimes est certifié GOTS. Il est issu de l’agriculture biologique (absence d’insecticide, de pesticide, d’engrais chimiques, d’OGM ; consommation d’eau réduite de moitié ; rotation des cultures). Ensuite, à toutes les étapes de transformation, les procédés utilisés sont respectueux de l'environnement et de la santé (les métaux lourds, les formaldéhydes, les enzymes OGM et les amines cancérigènes sont interdits). De plus, les agriculteurs et les travailleurs reçoivent une rétribution financière juste (prix d’achat du coton ou salaires), et bénéficient de bonnes conditions de travail. C’est donc du commerce équitable. Le coton est ensuite filé en Italie, puis édité par une grande maison française située dans l'Aube. </p>

<p>Nous allons produire notre première collection dans un atelier familial à Renaison, en région roannaise, où 10 personnes sont employées en CDI. La région, comme beaucoup d’autres, a été ravagée par la délocalisation de l’industrie du textile. En 2005, il y avait encore 100 ateliers de confection à Renaison, et aujourd’hui il n’en reste que 9.</p>
<p>90% du prix de vente de nos vêtements est directement injecté dans l'économie locale, soutenant 4 PME françaises. La production 100% européenne garantie également les conditions de travail et le salaire des travailleurs.</p>

  Back to Top GIVING BACK
 
 
WE BELIEVE THAT YOUNG GIRLS HAVE THE POWER TO END POVERTY AROUND THE WORLD. WHEN A GIRL IS GIVEN THE CHANCE TO STAY IN SCHOOL...
  Gain access to reproductive education,       And delay marriage and pregnancy,       SHE IS MUCH MORE LIKELY TO FIND GAINFUL EMPLOYMENT,
  Contribute financially to her household,      And earn the respect of her partner, family and community.       BREAKING THE CYCLE OF POVERTY. AND IT ALL STARTS WITH
ONE GIRL Multiply that by the millions of girls living in poverty worldwide. 
Imagine what a difference we can make! 
 
    Education For GirlsAs girl bosses, global citizens and social innovators, we believe that all women have the same rights to freedom and happiness. Females are the single biggest solution to poverty worldwide. When a girl completes high school, she is much more likely to avoid teen pregnancy, find gainful employment, contribute financially to her household and earn the respect of her partner and community.  Thus breaking the cycle of poverty.Our Les Sublimes supporters choose to be part of this long-term solution. Every time you purchase a piece of clothing from Les Sublimes, we pay it forward by supporting 1-month of education for a young girl in need. Because that's what being Sublimes is all about! ONE PIECE. ONE GIRL. ONE MONTH. Back to Top THE

  Back to Top OUR PURPOSE

""Our purpose at Les Sublimes is to make people happy while respecting mother nature, and to represent a hope for a better future. This is the soul of what we do.
 
 
 Les Sublimes exists to demonstrate that design, thoughtfulness and sustainability can be married in our consumption choices. We make people proud of the clothes they wear and the choices they make, proud that each decision can make a net-positive contribution to our natural surroundings, and demonstrate a new way of doing business for a collective future.
We know that a for-profit business with purpose can change people’s lives. Every time you shop Les Sublimes, you demand to see a new world. A world of beauty, mutual respect and integrity. That is what it means to be Sublimes.
  A RESPONSIBLE COMPANY We believe that integrity is just as important as style, price, quality and convenience. That’s why honesty and sustainability are integrated into every aspect of our business - from design and manufacturing, to killer customer service.
 
Availability & Accessibility
By engaging directly with our proud supporters online and working outside the traditional industry model, we are able to make sustainable products available to so many more people, at a much more affordable price. And that means that the social and environmental benefits of sustainable products can have a larger impact on the world around us. So much better, right? Transparent Production
We believe that you have a right to know exactly where the products you love come from and how they are produced. As a responsible company, being transparent holds us accountable to everyone connected with our brand. But it also gives you the freedom to select only the best products available. The Atelier
Confection Pérard in Renaison, France

It took us 6 months to find the perfect manufacturing partner to launch our Made in France collection. Confection Pérard is a small town atelier of master craftspeople specialized in making high quality knitwear. A 2nd-generation family business run by Thierry and Madame Pérard (mother + son), the atelier is one of the few surviving garment producers in the region. They credit their survival to their ethical values. Confection Pérard invests in training employees with a wide skill base, offers a flexible work schedule and guarantees high workplace standards. Many of their sewers have been with the company for over 20 years.

Back to Top 
  WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET We are asking for your support to order our first rolls of sustainable fabric! To make this first order a reality, we are raising € 10,000.
Fabric suppliers typically apply a 50% surcharge to smaller orders, making it impossible for us to maintain our affordable pricing and still earn a profit. By ordering our fabrics in bulk, we are able to get them at a much better price. And by selling our pieces directly to you online, we eliminate rent, middlemen and wholesale markups. Then we pass these savings on to you! That's how we can sell our clothes at between 25%-40% of the price of the luxury brands. Without any compromise.
 


STRETCH GOALS Starting small doesn’t mean we can't dream big. Here are some of the things we are currently working on:
If we surpass our target of € 10,000, we will re-invest the additional funds into growing Les Sublimes, adding 2 additional colors (grey and navy) and 5 new styles to our Made in France Collection.  We have already begun sourcing other luxurious, sustainable fabrics to add to our offering, including French linen, Peruvian organic pima cotton and cruelty-free cashmere from nomad communities in Mongolia.
Staying true to our worldly roots, we are also planning to expand our network of manufacturing partners outside of France so that we can incorporate more of the incredible craftsmanship found all over the world. Our underlying motivation is to share a fair and honest social production model that breaks from traditional textile industry practices.   
RISKS & CHALLENGES We've spent over a year planning our first collection and Indiegogo launch because we want to make sure that we get everything just right!
Production Partner: We've visited our knitwear manufacturer in person to inspect their facility, meet their employees and review every single detail of their manufacturing process. With over 45 years of experience, we have full confidence in our little atelier and can tell you that they are just as excited about our project as we are.
Ship date:  We've built in extra time for production and are confident we'll ship by the estimated dates, but there is always a small chance that things will take longer than planned. We'll keep you updated if anything changes :)
Collection Items:  We have worked back and forth for 6 months with our sample and pattern makers to get the fit of our styles perfect and to ensure that everything is done to the highest quality and comfort standards.
Our samples are production ready and our factory is simply waiting for us to place our first Les Sublimes order! We don't anticipate any problems, but should any hiccups arise, we'll keep you updated and in the loop on any new timelines.

   VERSION FRANÇAISE     ESSENTIELS DE LA GARDE-ROBE. SANS COMPROMIS.  
Les Sublimes offrent des essentiels de la garde-robe, classiques mais dans l’air du temps, pour les femmes inspirées par des voyages et des rencontres. Créées pour être portées à un brunch à Brooklyn ou en safari dans le Serengeti, ces pièces sont des parfaits intemporels que l’on souhaite porter encore et encore. Le tout sans aucun compromis sur l'éthique ou l'écologie. Aucun.
 
 NOTRE HISTOIRE
 
Chez les Sublimes, nous créons des vêtements qui vous aident à faire un meilleur choix d’achat - des essentiels qui portent nos convictions, respectent notre intégrité et mettent en valeur notre style. Sans compromis.
Les Sublimes offrent aux femmes un shopping différent, celui qui embellit le look et met du baume au cœur. Nos produits sont infusés de luxe, confort et style. Vendus directement aux consommateurs, leur prix reste accessible. Mais pas que. Chaque produit Les Sublimes est fabriqué avec l’intention de préserver l’écosystème délicat de notre planète et d’améliorer la vie des personnes ayant participé à la fabrication.
Qui a dit qu’on ne pouvait pas tout avoir ?
 

 
 
 
 
SIX MOTS POUR DEFINIR LES SUBLIMES 
1. Style
En recréant nos essentiels favoris avec une coupe parfaite, nous infusons les tendances modernes avec un esthétisme féminin et chic-nonchalant.

2. Luxe
Nous sélectionnons des matières de grande qualité avec un confort incroyable, doux et facile à porter. Puis nous les confectionnons en France pour bénéficier du savoir-faire français, donnant naissance à des modèles bien pensés et intemporels.
3. Prix abordable
100% en ligne et sans intermédiaire, ce modèle nous permet de proposer nos produits de qualité luxe à prix abordable : environ 40% du prix pratiqué par des maisons de luxe.
4. Faible impact environnemental
 
La réduction des impacts environnementaux de nos produits est notre priorité. La collection est réalisée à partir de matières premières naturelles, et transformées en utilisant des technologies de pointes qui réduisent la consommation d’eau et d’énergie, favorisent la réutilisation des déchets et préservent l’écosystème local.
 
5. Juste traitement
 
Les artisans et ouvriers ayant contribué à fabriquer nos produits reçoivent un salaire décent et bénéficient des droits fondamentaux au travail. Nous comptons exporter ce modèle social engagé vers nos futurs partenaires étrangers.
 
 
6. Espoir
Nous souhaitons apporter des solutions permanentes aux travailleurs de l’industrie du textile, avec des bons emplois qui briseraient la transmission de la pauvreté.
 
  Retour en haut REDONNER A LA SOCIÉTÉ
 
 
NOUS PENSONS QUE LES FILLES SONT LA SOLUTION POUR METTRE FIN A LA PAUVRETÉ DANS LE MONDE.
 
En tant qu’entrepreneuses, citoyennes du monde et innovatrices sociales, nous croyons que toutes les femmes ont les mêmes droits à la liberté et au bonheur dont nous sommes heureuses de proclamer. Les femmes sont une grande solution contre la pauvreté dans le monde. 
Une fille qui termine son parcours scolaire a meilleure chance d’éviter une grossesse adolescente, trouver un emploi, contribuer financièrement au foyer, gagner le respect de ses partenaires et de sa communauté. Ainsi elle brise le cercle de la pauvreté.
Chaque fois que vous achetez une pièce chez Les Sublimes, nous nous engageons à financer un mois d’école à une jeune fille au Kenya et au Népal, à travers des ONG locales. Soyez Sublimes jusqu’au bout! UNE PIÈCE. UNE FILLE. UN MOIS.

Retour en haut NOS FIBRES
    
Lenzing Modal
 
 
Le modal que nous utilisons est réalisé à base de pulpe de bois de hêtre, issu de forêts autrichiennes certifiées. La pulpe est traitée par la très innovante entreprise autrichienne Lenzing qui utilise un procédé peu gourmand en énergie et eau, et dont les substances chimiques sont recyclées à 95%. Le tout a lieu en Autriche. Cette fibre est ensuite tricotée par une entreprise autrichienne. 
Certifié  OekoTex Standard 100.
 
 
 
 
  Coton bio certifié GOTS
 
Le coton utilisé chez Les Sublimes est certifié GOTS. Il est issu de l’agriculture biologique (absence d’insecticide, de pesticide, d’engrais chimiques, d’OGM ; consommation d’eau réduite de moitié ; rotation des cultures). Ensuite, à toutes les étapes de transformation, les procédés utilisés sont respectueux de l'environnement et de la santé (les métaux lourds, les formaldéhydes, les enzymes OGM et les amines cancérigènes sont interdits). De plus, les agriculteurs et les travailleurs reçoivent une rétribution financière juste (prix d’achat du coton ou salaires), et bénéficient de bonnes conditions de travail. C’est donc du commerce équitable. Le coton est ensuite filé en Italie, puis édité par une grande maison française située dans l'Aube. 
Certifié  OekoTex Standard 100.
 
 
  Retour en haut  CALENDRIER La campagne dure 31 jours (du 20/06/2016 au 21/07/2016). La production des tissus aura lieu en août, puis la fabrication des vêtements en septembre. ♥  Les produits seront livrés fin septembre 2016.  ♥
 
  Retour en haut  UNE ENTREPRISE RESPONSABLE Nous sommes convaincus que l'empreinte sociale et environnementale est tout aussi important que le style, le prix, la qualité et le confort. C’est pourquoi nous avons intégré des critères sociaux et environnementaux tout au long de notre chaîne, du design à la production, sans oublier le transport et le packaging.
 
Production transparente
Nous pensons que vous avez le droit de connaître exactement où les produits que vous adorez proviennent et comment ils ont été produits. Etant une entreprise responsable, nous avons une responsabilité envers chaque personne liée à notre marque. Notre Atelier
Confection Pérard à Renaison, France

Nous allons produire notre première collection dans un atelier familial à Renaison, en région roannaise, où 10 personnes sont employées en CDI. La région, comme beaucoup d’autres, a été ravagée par la délocalisation de l’industrie du textile. En 2005, il y avait encore 100 ateliers de confection à Renaison, et aujourd’hui il n’en reste que 9.
90% du prix de vente de nos vêtements est directement injecté dans l'économie locale, soutenant 4 PME françaises. La production 100% européenne garantie également les conditions de travail et le salaire des travailleurs.

She is a miracle baby who saved her parent's life. Her father and I were in the middle of deep, dark addiction when we found we were pregnant. We investigated all options. At first, we thought abortion was the most loving option but I found that choice was not in my truth and I couldn't follow through so, I instantly got sober. The next path was adoption. I met with multiple agencies and even a few couples who will hopefully be wonderful parents one day but nothing felt right for my baby. So, I investigated parenting and discovered a reason to live. </span></h3>

Dear Friends, Family, Loved Ones and World,
My name is Samantha Erbe and I am a first time mother of Baby Tabitha. She is a miracle baby who saved her parent's life. Her father and I were in the middle of deep, dark addiction when we found we were pregnant. We investigated all options. At first, we thought abortion was the most loving option but I found that choice was not in my truth and I couldn't follow through so, I instantly got sober. The next path was adoption. I met with multiple agencies and even a few couples who will hopefully be wonderful parents one day but nothing felt right for my baby. So, I investigated parenting and discovered a reason to live. 
2 weeks after my daughter was born, I committed myself to an intensive inpatient treatment program (Tabitha was able to come with me). We were in treatment for 14 weeks and the therapy and training I received is invaluable. I am extremely grateful for the opportunity, the help I have received thus far and most importantly for my primary motivation, Baby Tabitha. 
Tabitha's father is also sober (he's on the fourth step) and we are consciously working together daily to create a healthy, sober environment for each other and for our baby. We just decided to live life again and we are on our way back up. I feel confident. I feel strong. I know we are going to make it.
And we could use your help.
Although we are both just now getting back to work, we need a few things to get us started. I believe we need to work for the things we want in life and put value on them and hold them sacred. However, I am willing to put my pride aside and realize my daughter's needs come first and I have listed the specific things I would be buying with your contributions. 
What We Need & What You Get
My intention for running this campaign is to give back to my daughter. She requires all of the wonderful things a new baby deserves in this life. We need a stroller, a car seat, a diaper bag, formula, diapers, a diaper genie and winter clothes. For all of these items, I am raising $2,500 and anything short of complete funding or anything left over will all go in an effort to care for my sweet daughter.

 Now comes the fun part: THE PERKS:

For a $5 donation, you will receive the satisfaction of knowing that you assisted a young, deserving family the ability to get on their feet. 
For a $10 donation, you will receive a picture of Baby Tabitha smiling at you and wearing an outfit of your favorite color.  
For a $25 donation, you will receive a short video of Tabitha giggling (everyone loves the sound of a baby laugh). 
For a $50 donation, we will try to make one of her first words be your name AND you will receive the title of ""Aunt"" or ""Uncle"". 
For a $100 contribution, you will get access to an iphoto album which will be updated weekly with new pictures of Baby Tabitha for a whole year.
For a $200 contribution, you will receive all of the above perks PLUS, an 8 x 11 poster with her hand and feet prints.
For a $500 contribution, you will receive all of the above perks PLUS, a personalized copy of her first year scrap book.
For any contribution made, you will receive a new friend. 
The Impact
By contributing to this campaign, you will be helping make this world a better place. If we all came together and helped each other in times of need, communities would be stronger, families would be closer and humans would experience a higher quality of life. It is our obligation to show up in situations like these and provide value where we can. If this sounds like a better world, a world you want to live in, a world you want to raise children in, then please, be the change you want to see in the world and make a decision to take action now. You can start with a really simple step of making a donation to this campaign and spreading the word. One action will lead to another and sooner than later, you will see all the ways love is surrounding us. 
Other Ways You Can Help
Besides making a donation, you can contribute to our family by spreading the word. Word of mouth is an amazing way to make a difference so please, post this on your Facebook, email this to your friends or use the share tools below and post this campaign on your social network with a few kind words. 
We are open to all kinds of assistance, if you maybe have some of these items or care to contact us directly to see how you can help, please feel free to email me at samerbe4444@gmail.com. 
Looking forward to hearing all the opportunities that await,

<h2><strong>#40DaysToGreatness</strong></h2>
<h2><strong>Why Custom? Why Dresses?</strong></h2>
<p>HelenJean wants to change the way women feel about themselves by creating custom fit, made to measure dresses that shift the focus away from their bodies (which are perfect by the way) and towards each woman's gifts and talents. Our goal is to create clothes for women to wear in their boldest moments, from landing jobs, to signing deals, to wowing on first dates. </p>
<p><img alt=""HelenJean clients in their dresses"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/907033/pictures/full/20130702175947-IMG_01922012.jpg?1372813192"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""HelenJean Fall12""/></p>
<p>We launched last fall in Vancouver, Canada and have been hosting trunk shows for almost a year now. This summer, we're planning our Fall 2013 collection and we want to reach the women who can't make it out to a trunk show. With our experience from the past year and a growing team of designers, developers and fit specialists, we'll create a new interactive web platform that brings our latest collection (and the trunk show experience) to women everywhere. </p>
<h2>Where did we get this idea?</h2>
<p>Have you ever picked out a bunch of items while shopping and then tried them all on, only to realize that nothing actually fit? Did you then wish that some part of you was smaller or bigger or just somehow better? That was founder Katie Jeanes' experience. Shopping trips with her friends resulted in changeroom therapy sessions and the final realization that perhaps, it wasn't her body at all. Perhaps it was the clothes. So, she decided to start her own line of dresses, where each dress is custom made for the wearer.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>""What if, rather than trying to fit our bodies into pre-made clothes, we made clothes that were custom fit for our bodies?"" <em>- Katie Jeanes, HelenJean founder</em></strong></h3>
<p>Having had a custom suit made in Bali, Indonesia, Katie knew the <strong>amazing shift that could happen when women are able to forget about their flaws and focus on something greater. </strong>Coming home from Bali, she could only find custom options for men. Companies like Indochino and J. Hilburn were providing made to measure suits, but there was nothing for women. Yet. HelenJean aims to change that, basing our model on a blend of successful menswear brands.</p>
<h2>What have we done so far?</h2>
<p>In September, we launched our first collection with six dresses inspired by incredible women we look up to. Katie's mum Lori, her namesake Katharine Hepburn, as well as bloggers and authors Heather White, Danielle LaPorte, Marie Forleo and Gabrielle Bernstein were our muses for Fall 2012. We held our first trunk show to test out the concept with a small group of women and it was a huge success.</p>

<p>The best part of the dress is the intention tag. Since we have no need for size numbers we ask women how they want to feel when they wear their dress and put that word into the back of each dress. Dubbed ""intention tags"", women can choose whatever word they like, and we've seen everything from beautiful to strong to really, really good looking. </p>
<p>We launched our Spring/Summer 2013 collection in May and debuted another six dresses. Even with a late start to Spring, we hosted over 50 women at our Vancouver trunk show. We know the demand is out there, and we know we have the ability to create beautiful clothes, as well as the ability to help women gain the confidence to really go after what they want in life. Our Fall 2013 collection is scheduled to launch August 15th. We already have women signing up for trunk shows, but we need your help to get there. </p>

<h2><strong>What happens at HelenJean?</strong></h2>
<p>We're all about helping women own their greatness. That includes the women that create each dress in Bali, Indonesia. We work with two village-owned tailoring cooperatives which provide jobs for both men and women in each village. When you order a dress, we send it over to Bali, they source just enough fabric as needed (waste not, want not), create a custom pattern, sew your dress, and then send it back over here so we can have a final look at it before we send it off to you. Our close relationship with our manufacturers means we get to know the team of people behind each dress, and make sure that they are all happy, healthy and owning their greatness as well. </p>
<p>Each dress takes three weeks from the time of ordering to arriving at your front door. Just in case it's not a perfect fit, we include a $50 tailoring credit with each purchase, so you can go get it tailored locally, and then send us the bill.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 30px;"">
<strong>""It is so amazing to put on a dress that fit you exactly and you know you look fabulous walking into any situation.""</strong> <em>- Lori, college professor</em>
</h3>
<h2>What will the funds be used for?</h2>
<p>Our goal is to raise enough money to fund the next 6 months of growing HelenJean across Canada and the US. We have the costs of creating our Fall 2013 collection, as well as building our new interactive website and doing outreach for the next 6 months. Some of the expenses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>pattern making</li>
<li>sample sewing</li>
<li>design tools and supplies</li>
<li>Fall trunk show venue rental</li>
<li>packaging and printing</li>
<li>website development</li>
<li>website hosting</li>
<li>accounting and legal services</li>
<li>software: CRM, finance, presentation</li>
</ul>
<h2>How can you help?</h2>
<p>First and foremost, we welcome your dollars! There are hard costs associated both with growing a fruitful, long-term venture like this. We've got some great perks to say thank you. (Did we mention we were thinking big? We know women wear more than dresses and we want to make some suits, skirts and jackets too)</p>

#40DaysToGreatness
Why Custom? Why Dresses?
HelenJean wants to change the way women feel about themselves by creating custom fit, made to measure dresses that shift the focus away from their bodies (which are perfect by the way) and towards each woman's gifts and talents. Our goal is to create clothes for women to wear in their boldest moments, from landing jobs, to signing deals, to wowing on first dates. 

We launched last fall in Vancouver, Canada and have been hosting trunk shows for almost a year now. This summer, we're planning our Fall 2013 collection and we want to reach the women who can't make it out to a trunk show. With our experience from the past year and a growing team of designers, developers and fit specialists, we'll create a new interactive web platform that brings our latest collection (and the trunk show experience) to women everywhere. 
Where did we get this idea?
Have you ever picked out a bunch of items while shopping and then tried them all on, only to realize that nothing actually fit? Did you then wish that some part of you was smaller or bigger or just somehow better? That was founder Katie Jeanes' experience. Shopping trips with her friends resulted in changeroom therapy sessions and the final realization that perhaps, it wasn't her body at all. Perhaps it was the clothes. So, she decided to start her own line of dresses, where each dress is custom made for the wearer.
""What if, rather than trying to fit our bodies into pre-made clothes, we made clothes that were custom fit for our bodies?"" - Katie Jeanes, HelenJean founder
Having had a custom suit made in Bali, Indonesia, Katie knew the amazing shift that could happen when women are able to forget about their flaws and focus on something greater. Coming home from Bali, she could only find custom options for men. Companies like Indochino and J. Hilburn were providing made to measure suits, but there was nothing for women. Yet. HelenJean aims to change that, basing our model on a blend of successful menswear brands.
What have we done so far?
In September, we launched our first collection with six dresses inspired by incredible women we look up to. Katie's mum Lori, her namesake Katharine Hepburn, as well as bloggers and authors Heather White, Danielle LaPorte, Marie Forleo and Gabrielle Bernstein were our muses for Fall 2012. We held our first trunk show to test out the concept with a small group of women and it was a huge success.


""I love my HelenJean dress! I love that it's made just for me and how the intention tag reminds me that I'm beautiful."" - Lindsey, recruiter


The best part of the dress is the intention tag. Since we have no need for size numbers we ask women how they want to feel when they wear their dress and put that word into the back of each dress. Dubbed ""intention tags"", women can choose whatever word they like, and we've seen everything from beautiful to strong to really, really good looking. 
We launched our Spring/Summer 2013 collection in May and debuted another six dresses. Even with a late start to Spring, we hosted over 50 women at our Vancouver trunk show. We know the demand is out there, and we know we have the ability to create beautiful clothes, as well as the ability to help women gain the confidence to really go after what they want in life. Our Fall 2013 collection is scheduled to launch August 15th. We already have women signing up for trunk shows, but we need your help to get there. 


What happens at HelenJean?
We're all about helping women own their greatness. That includes the women that create each dress in Bali, Indonesia. We work with two village-owned tailoring cooperatives which provide jobs for both men and women in each village. When you order a dress, we send it over to Bali, they source just enough fabric as needed (waste not, want not), create a custom pattern, sew your dress, and then send it back over here so we can have a final look at it before we send it off to you. Our close relationship with our manufacturers means we get to know the team of people behind each dress, and make sure that they are all happy, healthy and owning their greatness as well. 
Each dress takes three weeks from the time of ordering to arriving at your front door. Just in case it's not a perfect fit, we include a $50 tailoring credit with each purchase, so you can go get it tailored locally, and then send us the bill.

""It is so amazing to put on a dress that fit you exactly and you know you look fabulous walking into any situation."" - Lori, college professor

What will the funds be used for?
Our goal is to raise enough money to fund the next 6 months of growing HelenJean across Canada and the US. We have the costs of creating our Fall 2013 collection, as well as building our new interactive website and doing outreach for the next 6 months. Some of the expenses include:

pattern making
sample sewing
design tools and supplies
Fall trunk show venue rental
packaging and printing
website development
website hosting
accounting and legal services
software: CRM, finance, presentation

How can you help?
First and foremost, we welcome your dollars! There are hard costs associated both with growing a fruitful, long-term venture like this. We've got some great perks to say thank you. (Did we mention we were thinking big? We know women wear more than dresses and we want to make some suits, skirts and jackets too)

Percentages from sales for that month will go to that campaign. Campaigns may come in a wide variety, anything from food and clothes, to medical and school supplies. Whatever is most needed.

After dealing with the insurance agency for 2 weeks I was told they would send a check for the full replacement cost of the bike (hooray!). About a week after that I called to check on the status of the check only to be transfered around 3 times and to finally be told ""oh the deductible on this plan is $500 so your brand new bike and lock dont exceed that amount so you will get nothing"". Obviously upset, I thanked them for their time and  let them know how happy I was to find out this information 3 weeks into the process isntead of immediately when the agent, with my policy in front of them, was reviewing my claim. So I figured I would contact my apartment complex because it was stored in their ""secure"" garage. I was told that they are not responsible for anything taken from their parking garage secure or not....not entirely sure how a place can get away with calling their garage ""secure"" while doing nothing to ensure the security of said secure garage. My favortie part was when I told the fine folks at my apartment complex about the theft they then informed me they have an open investigation with Seattle police and someone had been breaking into the garage and stealing stuff over the previous months.....maybe I am an idiot but to me that seems like the type of thing that would be communicated to their tennants so people could take proper precautions to protect their belongings. You may be asking yourself, ""why do i care about this guy who got his bike stolen...bikes get stolen all the time""...and that would probably be my reaction too until it happened to me. It is incredibly heart breaking to work hard for something and only get to enjoy it for a week before some jerk steals it. This whole experience has taught me a valuable lesson...the criminals always win. I am hoping to have my faith in hummanity restored by the kindness of strangers. I would not ask this of anyone had I the means to replace this myself but my wife and I are having some financial issues currently and i just want my damn bike back.</p></div>","The process in dealing with my bike theft has been long and arduous.

</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<div>
<p>
</p>
<p>We believe that in this rapidly and
ever more increasingly transparent society, the new economic models
need to have the courage to build something up from a true essence,
with a sustainable approach that supports network developments
instead of classic pyramids; reducing <b>the distance between
perceived and real value </b>and generating cooperative
environments.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our product design is <b>totally
original</b>. Our shapes recall the vintage genre but have been carefully
studied to create a product with a <b>NEW character</b>. Most of the brands
that offer vintage-inspired eyewear, tend to copy old shapes,
revisiting them by only implementing new materials and technologies.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/756015/files/20140731021030-Schermata_2014-07-24_a_21.34.14.png?1406797830"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When creating <b>PORTRAIT Eyewear</b>, we dedicated a long time to the study of  the shapes, choosing a distinctive way to recall the vintage genre without becoming a repetition. To this matter, other than implementing original materials and new technologies, we offer shapes whose inspiration comes from elements associated to the visual arts fields in general, such as the <b>polygon-art trend and the  minimalistic-contemporary design.  </b><br/></p>
<p></p>

<p>
</p>
<p>- Original shapes and design.</p>
<p>- Flat contemporary design and use of
sharp shapes. </p>
<p>- Low-relief milling above the nose
bridge and sharp milling in the temples, all details that recall
a brand character and identity without using any logos. </p>
<p>- End-pieces acetate inserts. Usually
these elements are metallic to facilitate the product manufacture.
<b>PORTRAIT Eyewear </b>instead, has small acetate inserts on the frames'
end-pieces. This supposes a complex and precious workmanship
(totally attached by hand) .</p>

<p>From our business plan, we realized that most of the <b>hand-made brands </b>have <b>exorbitant prices</b> (around 300 GBP) and only very few could be considered, more affordable. Those we analyzed as potentially direct competitors -within our market research, might still be a little over-priced.</p>
<p><b>Our product intends to become the best price-quality ratio product of its kind in the eyewear market</b>. And we believe, after a long design study and intensive research, that we might be ready to face the challenge.</p>
<p>Our most inexpensive product, might still involve a richer material combination than the basic material eyewear offered by average brands.</p>
<p>At the same time, we want our costs' optimization to remain socially responsible along the whole supply-chain. For this reason, we count on the support of small to medium artisan companies that assure their staff an excellent work-environment, a proper reward and true dignity. <b>Ours is a slavery-free product. </b></p>

<h3>SELLING HAND-MADE EYEWEAR THROUGH THE INTERNET</h3>
<p>Our main challenge, apart from the common entrepreneurial risk of starting a new venture willing to compete in a saturated market, regards the difficulties of selling a wearable product, such as eyewear, through an e-commerce platform.</p>
<p>Having the stock stored in UK, we might be able to offer a free delivery service to allow customers to try the product on before buying it, in a short-term scenario. But a global free-of-charge delivery might be impossible at the beginning. </p>
<p><b>To solve this handicap, we will count on a customized and improved try-on software, that allows users to get a good idea of the </b><b>product look on their faces.</b></p>
<p>There are similar products in the market, but none of them satisfy our expectations, in terms of precision, versatility, real-time rendering and customizable interface. We count on the right developer's team to make it happen, with your contribution, we hope to be able to realize it. </p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><b><b>1. When is the product </b><b>going to be ready? When will I get my pair?</b></b></p>
<p>Production will start once the 45 days of crowd-funding campaign are over if the goals are met, and it will last for an entire month. If we don't get any delays, the shipments will start by the second half of October.</p>
<p><b>2. Do you have other colors available? </b></p>
<p>Right now, in the concept phase, our project includes 35 different kinds of glasses (mixing models and colors). As a consequence of budget restrictions, we have been able to fully develop 7 base models, resulting in a total of 17 different kinds of glasses. If we succeed in meeting the project goals, you can keep checking our official page <a href=""http://www.portraiteyewear.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.portraiteyewear.com</a> , where we will keep updating the product line.</p>
<p><b>3. Where is the stock based and where does the shipping come from? </b></p>
<p>The product will be shipped from London, UK. In the future, the shipment costs will be covered by the user. Right now as a special Indiegogo promotion, all shipping costs will be free as long as the crowd-funding goes on.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i><b>* For outside EU deliveries: some customs may charge duties for the item coming into the country.</b></i></p>
<p><b>4. What do I get by purchasing a pair of PORTRAIT (or anything else indicated as part of your purchase)? </b></p>
<p>Your PORTRAITs come in a design cardboard box presentation. This package is made entirely from recycled materials and has an FSC certificate. The package includes a microfiber glasses bag for your new PORTRAITs protection, made in Italy, a warranty-brochure and the original design recycled cardboard box.</p>
<p><b>5. Do you sell glasses with prescription?</b></p>
<p>Sorry, but we do not. Our brand sells frames for prescription glasses that the buyer then needs to take to a qualified optometrist to be fitted with the corresponding prescription. We also sell Sunglasses that includes all the lenses-filters, produced according to the European Community top quality standards.</p>
<p><b>6. How can I purchase a model that is not currently available?</b><br/></p>
<p>There are two models that are not currently available within our perks, these models are #3 and #13.  However, if you are interested in any of these items you just have to purchase a different model for the same price and send us a message to crowdfunding@portraiteyewear.com specifying the model you want.</p>
<p>We will immediately reply and keep track of your personal info (name, delivery address, eyewear choice, etc) to make sure you'll get the right glasses/sunglasses.

OUR DREAM
We are a brother and sister team who live between Italy, Spain and UK and dreamed of creating a design-focused eyewear brand that embraces the contemporary fashion trends, while respecting the actual market's needs through a fair prices policy, making the best use of current technologies and returning to the genuine artisan craftsmanship. 







PORTRAIT Eyewear preserves
the traditional quality and elegance of a hand-made luxury
product through an original-contemporary design at
a fair-trade price. 


To make such a formula
possible, Portrait Eyewear cuts the middle-man through
a straight-to-the-providers relationship strategy and by
commercializing itself through an e-commerce platform. We have optimized general costs and have reduced profit margins to ensure that our product is aligned with the principles of a socially responsible and sustainable business.



Whereas
a luxury hand-made product like ours would normally cost around 300
GBP, even our most expensive product will be sold for around half
that price. 









PORTRAIT
Eyewear strives to
be completely produced in Italy
and support  small-artisans
companies. Due to
its manufacturing process -which combines high technology and
traditional handcrafting- the product would be labeled as “100%
Handmade in Italy”.
















For personal passion and a profound admiration towards genuine artists, those who risk everything to give a deeper meaning to society Portrait Eyewear represents an opportunity to highlight such a laudable talent, setting the basis for a cooperative symbiosis with emerging artists by sponsoring their image -as extraordinary real people- through our product's communication strategy.






Our intention is to
continuously increase our artists' network
by honoring their work
and letting them be known beyond their immediate arena.




WHERE DO THE FUNDS GO TO





To be able to
realize this project at a substantial
scale,
we would need
approximately
60.000
GBP (see
scenario # 3) that include:



- The production of 1050 pieces (7
different models at a minimum amount of 150 pieces required by the
craftsmen, divided in 5 different colors each).
- Website design and development.

- Eyewear online try-on software development to allow users to try-the-product-on virtually.

- 360° product-photographs to allow users to see the product in detail.
- Brand's international trade-mark registration.
- Artists' campaign for at least 15 different people. More specifically, our artists' campaign costs will include all travel expenses and hosting for the photo-shoot (done by ourselves), as well as the web-marketing and SEO investment that has been agreed with them, to assure a win-win situation and a proper visibility of their work, outside of their close network.
- General development and other costs related to the legal business documents, paperwork and initial set-up requirements. 






OUR GOAL'S SCENARIOS
Nevertheless we are asking only part of the costs, that is, 20.000 GBP that would help us alleviate some of the product development's costs, allowing the craftsmen to be half-covered before starting with the final production, and the Artist's campaign to be partially done, that is, starting with 6 people.











IN REWARD FOR YOUR SUPPORT WE CAN OFFER YOU SOME UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES AND PERKS

1. A Thank You Note for 10 GBP





We will display all
our collaborators’
and fund providers’
names in a specific area within our website. This section will remain
visible
for a year.


2. A Post within our website's News-Section for 30 GBP (Reserved for designers, stylists, hand-crafters and emerging artists) 





We will have an
entire section dedicated to News related to our product-brand, as
well as to our continuous design and art research. This section is
also planned
to be
a channel to communicate eventual product's reviews, and of course,
our campaign artists' works and exhibitions.




In this section we
can also offer, to those who
came to know about
us through our crowd-funding campaign, the possibility of showing
their work (with a picture and a write-up
of it), chronologically displayed in a time-line. 
3. Product pre-order at a Preferential Price, from 84 GBP:

A luxury hand-made item like this,
would normally cost around 300 GBP.
Our product's cost depends on the
materials and available colors they are made of. Our final price list
will vary from around 99 GBP to 158 GBP, and the shipping costs will
be charged to the final customer. 

As a special offer to our first
potential customers and funders, we would like to pre-sell it from 84
GBP and free-shipping worldwide!



This is a unique
opportunity as
you
could own an exclusive
design product, totally hand-made in Italy with extreme care, love
and passion.




4. Become a part of our Campaign. With a small contribution and by sending us your CV/PORTFOLIO.

At this stage we might not be able to consider all the artists we would love to work within our Project's Campaign. Our goal is to be a means for emerging artists to be known out of their immediate network, as a symbol of honor and recognition. For that, we will use an important part of the web-marketing and SEO budget to assure them as much visibility as possible.
















In a few words, we will for sure carefully study your profile and consider it for our ongoing campaign. Subject to the final budget and relevance to the brand appeal, we will do our best to try to make it happen. It will take us time to check every CV/ Portfolio and carefully read them, which is why we are asking for a small contribution.
Currently, we live between Spain, UK and Italy, which already gives us the possibility of moving around these countries easily. Other state's artists, could be included depending on budget limitations and on the goal's achievement.



WHY PORTRAIT EYEWEAR?







We believe that in this rapidly and
ever more increasingly transparent society, the new economic models
need to have the courage to build something up from a true essence,
with a sustainable approach that supports network developments
instead of classic pyramids; reducing the distance between
perceived and real value and generating cooperative
environments.


Our product design is totally
original. Our shapes recall the vintage genre but have been carefully
studied to create a product with a NEW character. Most of the brands
that offer vintage-inspired eyewear, tend to copy old shapes,
revisiting them by only implementing new materials and technologies.


When creating PORTRAIT Eyewear, we dedicated a long time to the study of  the shapes, choosing a distinctive way to recall the vintage genre without becoming a repetition. To this matter, other than implementing original materials and new technologies, we offer shapes whose inspiration comes from elements associated to the visual arts fields in general, such as the polygon-art trend and the  minimalistic-contemporary design.  




ORIGINAL FEATURES



- Original shapes and design.
- Flat contemporary design and use of
sharp shapes. 
- Low-relief milling above the nose
bridge and sharp milling in the temples, all details that recall
a brand character and identity without using any logos. 
- End-pieces acetate inserts. Usually
these elements are metallic to facilitate the product manufacture.
PORTRAIT Eyewear instead, has small acetate inserts on the frames'
end-pieces. This supposes a complex and precious workmanship
(totally attached by hand) .



-
No presence of visible logos.



-
Original upper rim outlining that combines classic precious
materials with contemporary plain colors. 







From our business plan, we realized that most of the hand-made brands have exorbitant prices (around 300 GBP) and only very few could be considered, more affordable. Those we analyzed as potentially direct competitors -within our market research, might still be a little over-priced.
Our product intends to become the best price-quality ratio product of its kind in the eyewear market. And we believe, after a long design study and intensive research, that we might be ready to face the challenge.
Our most inexpensive product, might still involve a richer material combination than the basic material eyewear offered by average brands.
At the same time, we want our costs' optimization to remain socially responsible along the whole supply-chain. For this reason, we count on the support of small to medium artisan companies that assure their staff an excellent work-environment, a proper reward and true dignity. Ours is a slavery-free product. 






Besides,
our production process, in all its steps, strongly adheres to
environmentally- friendly
practices. All of our
suppliers have an energy-efficient philosophy and follow the
principles of a sustainable business.





Even the last
supply-chain step, that is, our product packaging production, counts
on FSC recycled cardboard; its design is totally foldable (no-glue
needed) and completely original. It ensures safe
product delivery, combining the principles of a
design-product-wrapping and a resistant delivery packing.




SELLING HAND-MADE EYEWEAR THROUGH THE INTERNET
Our main challenge, apart from the common entrepreneurial risk of starting a new venture willing to compete in a saturated market, regards the difficulties of selling a wearable product, such as eyewear, through an e-commerce platform.
Having the stock stored in UK, we might be able to offer a free delivery service to allow customers to try the product on before buying it, in a short-term scenario. But a global free-of-charge delivery might be impossible at the beginning. 
To solve this handicap, we will count on a customized and improved try-on software, that allows users to get a good idea of the product look on their faces.
There are similar products in the market, but none of them satisfy our expectations, in terms of precision, versatility, real-time rendering and customizable interface. We count on the right developer's team to make it happen, with your contribution, we hope to be able to realize it. 




 CAN'T HELP THROUGH FUNDS?







Our
project doesn't limit its goal to creating a new brand and making a
new venture possible. Through PORTRAIT
Eyewear,
you are directly contributing to the local-market and supporting
genuine craftsmen, as well as a group of emerging artists, both of
which are roles that are in great danger in the actual market
currently. 







You can be of
great help by sharing our campaign through your social network
profiles, by emailing it or just by
talking about it. 





Your opinion is also
very important to
us, please feel free to send it through the following
email: crowdfunding@portraiteyewear.com

Thanks for your

FAQ
1. When is the product going to be ready? When will I get my pair?
Production will start once the 45 days of crowd-funding campaign are over if the goals are met, and it will last for an entire month. If we don't get any delays, the shipments will start by the second half of October.
2. Do you have other colors available? 
Right now, in the concept phase, our project includes 35 different kinds of glasses (mixing models and colors). As a consequence of budget restrictions, we have been able to fully develop 7 base models, resulting in a total of 17 different kinds of glasses. If we succeed in meeting the project goals, you can keep checking our official page www.portraiteyewear.com , where we will keep updating the product line.
3. Where is the stock based and where does the shipping come from? 
The product will be shipped from London, UK. In the future, the shipment costs will be covered by the user. Right now as a special Indiegogo promotion, all shipping costs will be free as long as the crowd-funding goes on.


* For outside EU deliveries: some customs may charge duties for the item coming into the country.
4. What do I get by purchasing a pair of PORTRAIT (or anything else indicated as part of your purchase)? 
Your PORTRAITs come in a design cardboard box presentation. This package is made entirely from recycled materials and has an FSC certificate. The package includes a microfiber glasses bag for your new PORTRAITs protection, made in Italy, a warranty-brochure and the original design recycled cardboard box.
5. Do you sell glasses with prescription?
Sorry, but we do not. Our brand sells frames for prescription glasses that the buyer then needs to take to a qualified optometrist to be fitted with the corresponding prescription. We also sell Sunglasses that includes all the lenses-filters, produced according to the European Community top quality standards.
6. How can I purchase a model that is not currently available?
There are two models that are not currently available within our perks, these models are #3 and #13.  However, if you are interested in any of these items you just have to purchase a different model for the same price and send us a message to crowdfunding@portraiteyewear.com specifying the model you want.
We will immediately reply and keep track of your personal info (name, delivery address, eyewear choice, etc) to make sure you'll get the right glasses/sunglasses. The only reason we do not have an specific perk for these items is that the maximum amount of perks allowed per campaign is 20 and we wanted to leave room for some of the artist's work.",53.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, we are the team behind Simmone Standing The Label and we have had the immense pleasure of being invited to showcase our Spring /Summer 2016 Collection on the Fashion Palette New York runway in September.</p>
<p>This is an amazing opportunity not only for the head designer Simmone, but also her team of enthusiastic volunteers who get to be involved in the ‘behind the scenes’ view of a runway show and gain knowledge in developing a story around a collection. </p>
<p>Contributing to this campaign means that parallel to assisting the head designer Simmone showcase her designs on an international platform, you will also be encouraging other young aspiring designers who come to Simmone for mentorship to see that there is always opportunity and a means to follow their dreams!  No ambition is too big or out of reach if you have the passion to make it happen!</p>

<p><i>“Something Starting Right Now”</i> Spring Summer collection sought to create a range of garments that are adventurous in the wearing, that tickle the inner girl of the most sophisticated woman and inspire new dimensions of wearing statement pieces. </p>
<p>This is to be Simmone Standing The Label’s second collection and like the previous collection has a unique story all of its own. Thinking ocean shapes mixed with crisp detailing and decisive cuts head designer Simmone has let the whimsy of Disney’s “The Little Mermaid” and the sheer sophistication of Katherine Hepburn amalgamate into her inspiration; androgyny with seashells…</p>
<p>This campaign will release sneak peak shoots showing minor detail, colours and shapes to keep you excited with anticipation but will predominantly be kept secret until it hits the runway in New York shhh… </p>

</div><br/></div>","Our first
crowd funding launch was successful in gaining us the deposit for our entry fee
into New York Fashion Week - Fashion Palette runway show. 
We have
learnt so much from this experience being our first ever campaign and have seen
where we could improve on our exposure and background efforts to entice you and
others to join our journey! In order to capitalize on being the ONLY Adelaide designer among 20 Australian designers showcasing at the New York Fashion Week and to address the request of those who expressed a wish to contribute but missed the opportunity, we have re-launched our campaign until August 23rd so that we can raise more to promote Simmone Standing The Label, Adelaide Fashion and South Australia to the world in New York!
Hi, we are the team behind Simmone Standing The Label and we have had the immense pleasure of being invited to showcase our Spring /Summer 2016 Collection on the Fashion Palette New York runway in September.
This is an amazing opportunity not only for the head designer Simmone, but also her team of enthusiastic volunteers who get to be involved in the ‘behind the scenes’ view of a runway show and gain knowledge in developing a story around a collection. 
Contributing to this campaign means that parallel to assisting the head designer Simmone showcase her designs on an international platform, you will also be encouraging other young aspiring designers who come to Simmone for mentorship to see that there is always opportunity and a means to follow their dreams!  No ambition is too big or out of reach if you have the passion to make it happen!


“Something Starting Right Now” Spring Summer collection sought to create a range of garments that are adventurous in the wearing, that tickle the inner girl of the most sophisticated woman and inspire new dimensions of wearing statement pieces. 
This is to be Simmone Standing The Label’s second collection and like the previous collection has a unique story all of its own. Thinking ocean shapes mixed with crisp detailing and decisive cuts head designer Simmone has let the whimsy of Disney’s “The Little Mermaid” and the sheer sophistication of Katherine Hepburn amalgamate into her inspiration; androgyny with seashells…
This campaign will release sneak peak shoots showing minor detail, colours and shapes to keep you excited with anticipation but will predominantly be kept secret until it hits the runway in New York shhh… 

To be involved in this amazing opportunity we need to raise money to cover the following costs: 
· $15,000 entry fee 
· Flights 
· Accommodation 
· Insurance
· Venue Hire 
· Models 
· Makeup 
· Hair Stylists 
· Advertising 
· Promotion
· Photography
· VIP gifting opportunities 
· Celebrities wearing garments 
In the event we exceed our expectations it will provide more areas of opportunity for our enthusiastic team of volunteers with behind the scenes and runway experiences. It will also assist us promote production and enable us to go for stronger marketing prospects. 


All donations will receive a personal email to say thank you for your support. All perks from ""Thank you post card"" onwards will also receive a post card and be ""Named AMAZING!"" on our marketing website as an extra thank you for your support!! Please indicate if you would not wish to be named on the website- but we still think you are amazing!!
All perks do not include travel, flights or accommodation

<h2 style=""color: #5C6E0E;"">About Bodhi Tree Collections</h2>
<p>Bodhi Tree Collections started two years ago, after I visited Vietnam and fell in love with the bamboo and natural lacquer decorative items I discovered during my travels. I met some incredible friends there who turned me onto the process and shared their artwork with me. Ever since, I have been working to bring these handmade items made from organic, sustainable materials to the US. I’ve imported some initial designs and sold them in stores throughout the US both online and off.</p>
<p>In working through the process of designing, importing and selling, I have recognized what I can do to improve the business by creating a fun, configurable product that beautifies the bath in a chemical free, orgainic way; helps to save time and money with shapes that are easy to clean, while maintaining the eco-friendly aspect of the designs that first impressed me. After some meditation and research on the topic I decided to take my next steps with this IndieGoGo campaign. In order to allow my company to take its next steps, I'm giving you the chance to get your hands on these beauties before anyone else does, all while supporting an international network of artists involved and being a good environmental steward in the process.</p>

<h2 style=""color: #5C6E0E;"">What are the Funds For?</h2>
<p>With your pledge, I'll be able to source and transport my base shapes from Vietnam to my warehouse in the USA, with a portion of the proceeds going back to the women that make the bamboo items by hand. I'll also be able to manufacture my charms locally in California and begin marketing and selling the new designs.</p>
<h4>Cost Specifics</h4>
<p><b>Master Models:</b> These are solid metal and clay models in the shape of my new designs. I have already created these for my first set of charms. When it’s time to design the next release of charms, I’ll work with local artist who should be reasonably compensated for their work.
<br/><br/>
<b>Casting Molds:</b> These are the molds created with the Master Models and used to pour the molten metal for mass production. We have already created one mold for the five initial charms, which should last up to 20 or 30 production runs. To make more charms than this, I will also need to create additional molds.
<br/><br/>
<b>Metal and Materials:</b> Each charm weighs less than half a pound. Your pledge funds will help support the expense of the recycled metal used, other materials in casting and the time of the casters. Then exact quantity will depend on the amount of pledges.
<br/><br/>
<b>Production of Bamboo Base Shapes:</b> Once the campaign is complete, your pledge will help to get my friends in Vietnam working on the base shapes. It takes them roughly three months to complete all the steps required, so assessing the quantity of the base shape and volume of each will be a first priority after the campaign ends. I’ve already worked with them to design the initial samples and now need to tell them how many of which shapes to make.
<br/><br/>
<b>Third Party Inspection Company for Bamboo Shapes:</b> In order to avoid inconsistencies in the design and high quality products, we will get another set of eyes to inspect and send a report before the items are shipped.
<br/><br/>
<b>Importing the Bamboo Base Shapes:</b> Once complete, the bamboo base shapes will need to be packed and shipped over from Vietnam to Southern California. It’s usually best to have them travel by sea.
<br/><br/>
<b>Packaging:</b> This is how the charms and base shapes will make their way safely to you from our warehouse. I’m working to narrow down a safe way of packing with minimum waste that does the gorgeous pieces justice. A smooth and efficient delivery process will require a Fulfillment Agency. In this way, your eco-friendly designs will arrive safe and sound, and on time.</p>
<br/>
<h2 style=""color: #5C6E0E;"">Risks and Challenges</h2>
As with any manufactured products there are risks. Here are a few of the risks that I feel confidently able to overcome:
<br/><br/>
<b>Loose agreements for timeline:</b> When dealing with villagers in Vietnam, time is much more malleable than we think of it in western cities. Additionally, in Asia the Lunar New Year celebration (which is at the beginning of February this year) means work stops for at least a week if not a week and a half, so timeline could be stretched slightly to allow for the holiday.
<br/><br/>
<b>Weather:</b> Since the bamboo base shapes are usually cured in the sunshine, prolonged rain in Vietnam could delay completion.
<br/><br/>
<b>Product Consistency:</b> This is less a problem with the metal charms than it is with our bamboo base shapes. To assure that the products are created exactly as agreed, we’ll employ a 3rd party inspection agency to inspect a sample if the designs before delivery so we know we’ll get what we’re expecting.
<br/><br/>
<b>Importing Bottlenecks and Schedules:</b> The base shapes will be shipped by sea and are therefore subject to the schedules set by the ocean liners and transportation brokers. This is a risk at both ends, the port in Vietnam as well as the port in Los Angeles. Extenuating circumstances like worker strikes or bad weather can increase the time it takes for the items to arrive.

Step 2: Once the bamboo is collected, it is soaked in local ponds for four months to a full year. This method naturally fumigates the organic materials by pulling out the natural sweetness of the bamboo stalk, making insects naturally repelled.




Step 3: After the natural fumigation process is complete and the bamboo has fully dried, the Bamboo is cut into long, thin, even stalks by hand.

Step 5: Once the desired shape has been created, the shape is coated with a rice glue, smoothing out the design. The coated design is allowed to dry in the sunshine or by a fire in the winter months.




Step 6: After the piece has dried, multiple light coats of rice glue are applied to ensure rigidness and longevity. Each layer will dry in the sunlight and be polished by hand. The desired color will be added as the final layer. In our IndieGoGo design, we are featuring our newest Bodhi Tree Collections line with natural bamboo coloring paired with a crisp white lacquer color base.

About Bodhi Tree Collections
Bodhi Tree Collections started two years ago, after I visited Vietnam and fell in love with the bamboo and natural lacquer decorative items I discovered during my travels. I met some incredible friends there who turned me onto the process and shared their artwork with me. Ever since, I have been working to bring these handmade items made from organic, sustainable materials to the US. I’ve imported some initial designs and sold them in stores throughout the US both online and off.
In working through the process of designing, importing and selling, I have recognized what I can do to improve the business by creating a fun, configurable product that beautifies the bath in a chemical free, orgainic way; helps to save time and money with shapes that are easy to clean, while maintaining the eco-friendly aspect of the designs that first impressed me. After some meditation and research on the topic I decided to take my next steps with this IndieGoGo campaign. In order to allow my company to take its next steps, I'm giving you the chance to get your hands on these beauties before anyone else does, all while supporting an international network of artists involved and being a good environmental steward in the process.

What are the Funds For?
With your pledge, I'll be able to source and transport my base shapes from Vietnam to my warehouse in the USA, with a portion of the proceeds going back to the women that make the bamboo items by hand. I'll also be able to manufacture my charms locally in California and begin marketing and selling the new designs.
Cost Specifics
Master Models: These are solid metal and clay models in the shape of my new designs. I have already created these for my first set of charms. When it’s time to design the next release of charms, I’ll work with local artist who should be reasonably compensated for their work.

Casting Molds: These are the molds created with the Master Models and used to pour the molten metal for mass production. We have already created one mold for the five initial charms, which should last up to 20 or 30 production runs. To make more charms than this, I will also need to create additional molds.

Metal and Materials: Each charm weighs less than half a pound. Your pledge funds will help support the expense of the recycled metal used, other materials in casting and the time of the casters. Then exact quantity will depend on the amount of pledges.

Production of Bamboo Base Shapes: Once the campaign is complete, your pledge will help to get my friends in Vietnam working on the base shapes. It takes them roughly three months to complete all the steps required, so assessing the quantity of the base shape and volume of each will be a first priority after the campaign ends. I’ve already worked with them to design the initial samples and now need to tell them how many of which shapes to make.

Third Party Inspection Company for Bamboo Shapes: In order to avoid inconsistencies in the design and high quality products, we will get another set of eyes to inspect and send a report before the items are shipped.

Importing the Bamboo Base Shapes: Once complete, the bamboo base shapes will need to be packed and shipped over from Vietnam to Southern California. It’s usually best to have them travel by sea.

Packaging: This is how the charms and base shapes will make their way safely to you from our warehouse. I’m working to narrow down a safe way of packing with minimum waste that does the gorgeous pieces justice. A smooth and efficient delivery process will require a Fulfillment Agency. In this way, your eco-friendly designs will arrive safe and sound, and on time.

Risks and Challenges
As with any manufactured products there are risks. Here are a few of the risks that I feel confidently able to overcome:

Loose agreements for timeline: When dealing with villagers in Vietnam, time is much more malleable than we think of it in western cities. Additionally, in Asia the Lunar New Year celebration (which is at the beginning of February this year) means work stops for at least a week if not a week and a half, so timeline could be stretched slightly to allow for the holiday.

Weather: Since the bamboo base shapes are usually cured in the sunshine, prolonged rain in Vietnam could delay completion.

Product Consistency: This is less a problem with the metal charms than it is with our bamboo base shapes. To assure that the products are created exactly as agreed, we’ll employ a 3rd party inspection agency to inspect a sample if the designs before delivery so we know we’ll get what we’re expecting.

Importing Bottlenecks and Schedules: The base shapes will be shipped by sea and are therefore subject to the schedules set by the ocean liners and transportation brokers. This is a risk at both ends, the port in Vietnam as well as the port in Los Angeles. Extenuating circumstances like worker strikes or bad weather can increase the time it takes for the items to arrive.

Virtual Staffing vs Traditional Employees


I realize the power that a smart, dedicated, Virtual Assistant team brings me - and now I want to bring the power of outsourcing to other people who are passionate about making their dreams come true!
I took all the things that DO work when using Virtual Outsourcing - and fixed all the things that DON'T work.

One of the clearest risks I see when working with a Virtual Assistant, is the ‘single point of failure’ syndrome for your business.This means, that many entrepreneurs already using fantastic Virtual Staff have invested so much time and trust in one Virtual Assistant, if that Virtual Staff member leaves (illness, family illness, etc) the entrepreneur's business stops.Overnight.  Not Good!Zen Virtual Assistants avoids this problem with the ‘one point of connection’ system and ‘Zen Team’.This means, our clients have 'one point of connection' with a dedicated Zen Team Leader.  This allows for easy communication and efficiency, BUT under that single point of communication is an entire team with multiple redundancies!Also, your Zen Team Leader is constantly building an ‘Operations Manual’ for our clients.This means, if our clients ever decide to leave Zen Virtual Assistants, they leave with a complete ‘Operations Manual’ for their business - Social Media Account details, e-mail logins, contact lists, access to previous projects, video tutorials, etc.Other Ways You Can Help!Listen, even if you don’t have a business, you can help spread the work - and make some money too!Join our Zen Virtual Assistant Referral Program and make $50 per referral!What?! What?!Ya!

Hello, my name is Michelle Poirier, and I like spending all my time 
weaving metal. Chainmaille jewelry is my passion, and the following 
photos will show you the pieces I love creating the most.</p>
<p>I have 
some crazy wonderful ideas for new things to make, but they will require
 a lot more supplies to make as they are substantial creations.  I 
promise they are going to look awesome and I will have them in my Artfire and Zibbet 
shops this spring... if I get the money to buy materials to make them 
that is.</p>
<p>This is where you come in!</p>
<p>If you support my 
campaign by buying any of the reward tiers listed here 
you'll help fund my spring line of jewelry, and also get yourself some 
great jewelry! (or get some great jewelry for your family, or friends, 
or even all of you!).<br/></p>

<p>I just love chainmaille and scalemail!  Despite being all metal 
jewelry, these pieces are very lightweight :) They are made using

<p><strong>The Heritage Chronograph  </strong></p>
<p>We would like to present our first model ‘The Heritage Chronograph’. We wanted to design a watch that looks like a high end business watch but also has the functionality of a sportive chronograph that lasts decades. To achieve this, we combined a timeless design with modern day specifications. At the heart of ‘The Heritage Chronograph’ beats a functional and reliable Mecha-Quartz movement provided by Seiko (VK63). This movement combines the reliability of quartz with the benefits of a mechanical movement. The chronograph sweeps 5 times a second and has an instant snap-back reset. The other benefit this movement has over traditional quartz movements is that it doesn’t needs battery power to reset. This improves the overall energy efficiency. At last it’s also possible to change the time when the chronograph is still running</p>

</div></div>","Vescari Watch Co. is a young watch brand based in The Netherlands. Having worked in the luxury (watch)retail for several years, combined with a passion for watches Vescari Watch Co. saw the light in the summer of 2015. Vescari Watch Co. wants to provide their customers with a watch that is built with attention to detail and with high-end components. This all for an affordable price. After a couple of months designing, the prototypes/samples have been produced and tested. The only thing we need now is your support.

 

 

 

 
The Heritage Chronograph  
We would like to present our first model ‘The Heritage Chronograph’. We wanted to design a watch that looks like a high end business watch but also has the functionality of a sportive chronograph that lasts decades. To achieve this, we combined a timeless design with modern day specifications. At the heart of ‘The Heritage Chronograph’ beats a functional and reliable Mecha-Quartz movement provided by Seiko (VK63). This movement combines the reliability of quartz with the benefits of a mechanical movement. The chronograph sweeps 5 times a second and has an instant snap-back reset. The other benefit this movement has over traditional quartz movements is that it doesn’t needs battery power to reset. This improves the overall energy efficiency. At last it’s also possible to change the time when the chronograph is still running

 

 
Case  
The case of ‘The Heritage Chronograph’ is made from 316L Stainless steel and has a diameter of 41mm with a case height of 10mm. The watch measures 49mm from lug to lug and has a lug width from 22-20 mm. We also offer a color theme with a PVD rose gold plating on the case.

 
Crown  
A watch is mostly operated by its crown. There for we produced a crown that’s not only appealing to look at but also easy to use. Through its deep grooves it’s easily pulled or wind at the correct time. For the design we’ve chosen to put our V from Vescari Watch Co. on our crown.

Sapphire Crystal  
To provide the quality and reliability we stand for, it’s an obvious choice our Heritage Chronograph is equipped with a Sapphire Crystal. This type of crystal is found in the majority of the premium watches and three times harder than mineral crystal. It’s made of an extremely durable synthetic material that makes it shatterproof and scratch resistant.
Case Back  
Our case backs are engraved with our company name together with the model code depending on the color of the watch.  
• VSC-01SB Steel edition with black dial 
• VSC-01SW Steel edition with white ceramic dial 
• VSC-01RGW Rose gold edition with white ceramic dial

 
Dial  
For our watch dials we’ve chosen a timeless look. The hour index markers are printed roman numerals with a classic chronograph design at 3-6-9 hours. The second hand is positioned at 6 o’clock, the minute sub dial at 9 o’clock and the 24hour sub dial at 3 o’clock. Our watch hands are manufactured in a steel version, blue version and black version depending on the model

Hello!<br/><p>I am Dr. Giovanni Russo and I am the CEO of Warm Wild.</p>
<p>I want to introduce our project: The Warm Wild under garment. Our goal was to develop the perfect<a href=""http://www.warmwild.it/en/technical-underwear/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> sports under garment</a> using the properties of <a href=""http://www.warmwild.it/en/far-infrared-rays/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">F.I.R. (Far Infrared Rays)</a> emitted by <a href=""http://www.warmwild.it/en/bioceramic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bioceramic Fiber</a>. Whatever sport you practice, at any level, in any condition, Warm Wild is the perfect sports underwear.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/57674/files/20130906135054-giovannirusso1.jpg?1378500654"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.warmwild.it/en/bioceramic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bioceramic Fiber</a> is a very particular thread able to emit<a href=""http://www.warmwild.it/en/far-infrared-rays/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> F.I.R.</a> and has been shown to have many beneficial properties which can be used to assist the body, particularly during physical activity. Bioceramic allows your body to quickly reach and keep a perfect state of thermal equilibrium by increasing vasodilation and blood microcirculation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A number of medical studies done in Japan in the last 20 years have show that FIR can even be used as a therapy for certain diseases including cardiovascular diseases, including chronic heart failure (CHF) and peripheral artery disease (PAD). This approach is called WAON Therapy; WAON means 'Soothing Warmth'. (<a href=""http://www.warmwild.it/en/references/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">references can be found here</a>)</p>
<p>Starting from this data I had the idea to develop a new thread/fiber made from bioceramic able to radiate FIR directly on the skin.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, materials and production of this underwear are expensive, we are looking for $30,000 just to start the production of the first batch of shirts.</p>
<p>We are a new company and your Support is fundamental to make our idea grow and became real.</p>
<p>With your contribution we can offer to you as a supporter a price that is considerably lower than the normal retail price.<br/></p>

<p>This underwear is ideal for every endurance sport like running, biking, climbing, mountain biking, etc. but also simply walking. Warm Wild underwear is perfectly suited for difficult conditions, characterized by thermal stress, when thermoregulation is crucial like skiing, cross-country, snowboarding, hiking, diving, and skydiving.</p>
<p>We strongly believe in this project and we will go on developing it even if the support from you will not reach our target but of course it may cause delays and exaggerate costs for us, which is why your contribution is needed so much!</p>

<p></p>FIR - FAR INFRA RED RAYS are the source of energy for all living beings on earth. They lie in the spectrum of sunlight that is also absorbed by the human body and are particularly abundant in the morning sun and at sunset. FIR can penetrate the body by up to 5-7 cm and have healthy powers and beneficial effects that have been proven by many clinical studies and have been know about for more than 30 years.<p></p>
<p><br/> How can we take advantage of these benefits?<br/> What can we use to make these rays available when no direct solar radiation is present?<br/> How to leverage these effects to improve sports performance?<br/> How to exploit their thermoregulatory effect to create an innovative underwear that can improve the comfort of the wearer?</p>
<p>The Warm Wild project was born from these questions and addresses these challenges combining technology and innovation. The technology of bioceramic fabrics to create a new technical underwear with unique properties.</p>
<p> Bioceramic is a material that emits FIR naturally and can be added to textile fibers, it is composed of a mixture of non-toxic mineral oxides such as platinum, titanium, and aluminum, added to the fiber in liquid form to produce fabrics able to exploit all its properties. These fabrics are already used in some fields such as aerospace and medical. Fabrics containing bioceramic are used to cover the inside of the space shuttles to double the energy of sunlight, also astronauts wear tracksuits internally coated with bioceramic fabric.</p>
<p>Once in contact with the body, this kind of fabric also has the ability to reflect FIR naturally emitted by the human body increasing the global effect. Additional benefits of bioceramics are antibacterial and permanent anti-odor characteristics.</p>
<p> Warmwild technical underwear is made of fabrics containing fibers with different percentages of bioceramics, maintaining the characteristics of lightness, breathability, compression, and elasticity typical of fabrics used for the production of the best technical underwear, but with the added unique bioceramic properties.</p>
<p> Warm Wild garments come from the combination of the best existing technology coupled with the unique characteristics of Bioceramic. A technical underwear suitable for any kind of activity thanks to the ability of Bioceramic to regulate body temperature and especially effective for those activities characterized by high dynamism and carried out in very cold weather. In these conditions FIR emitted by Bioceramic allow to quickly reach and keep a perfect state of thermal equilibrium by increasing vasodilation and blood microcirculation.</p>
<h2>The Fabric</h2>
<p></p>
<p>The fabric of the WarmWild sportswear was born from the combination of bioceramic threads and the great design of a high quality fabric from these threads with features that enhance the effect. In order to obtain a unique undergarment we asked an industry leader in the textile industry with more than thirty years of experience to design a fabric with these characteristics.</p>
<p>This led to the creation of the fabric that we called APT®P: Always Perfect Temperature. The APT fabric is able to optimize the effect of thermoregulation of the <a href=""http://www.warmwild.it/en/bioceramic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bioceramics</a>, allowing our athletes to wear the same shirt in cold conditions and extremely hot conditions. People who love sports and practice both summer and winter sports know that often, especially in the mountains, the weather changes very quickly. For this reason we wanted to develop a base layer that would work in every condition, in every season.</p>
<p>So, in addition to the laboratory tests we had a crazy idea. Certain of the quality of our product and the validity of our theories we asked a number of high-level athletes to try out our shirts and give us their <a href=""http://www.warmwild.it/en/testimonials/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">testimony</a> with their true feelings after performing their favorite sport. In their tests our shirts were worn in the snow, the summer heat, high altitudes and at sea level.</p>
<p>The WarmWild undershirt proven ideal in all conditions of heat, cold and warm weather. The characteristics of extreme breathability make it the ideal undershirt during exercise allowing the athlete to quickly disperse the heat and sweat. The effect of temperature control maintains the body temperature constant in the optimum range, preventing both dispersions and accumulations of heat and cold, maintaining a perfect temperature. Bioceramic also has an anti-bacterial and anti-odor effect; this, coupled with the ability to regulate he body's temperature keeps you from wearing a smelly, wet t-shirt.</p>
<p>WarmWild, thanks to the extreme comfort of the APT fabric is comfortable to wear, lightweight and snug, without being overly tight/compressive. These features of the APT fabric make the WarmWild undershirt the ideal piece of clothing in all seasons and weather conditions!</p>
<p>We have produced an undergarment with all these features and we are proud and confident that it will become a great sports ally.</p>

Hello!I am Dr. Giovanni Russo and I am the CEO of Warm Wild.
I want to introduce our project: The Warm Wild under garment. Our goal was to develop the perfect sports under garment using the properties of F.I.R. (Far Infrared Rays) emitted by Bioceramic Fiber. Whatever sport you practice, at any level, in any condition, Warm Wild is the perfect sports underwear.



Bioceramic Fiber is a very particular thread able to emit F.I.R. and has been shown to have many beneficial properties which can be used to assist the body, particularly during physical activity. Bioceramic allows your body to quickly reach and keep a perfect state of thermal equilibrium by increasing vasodilation and blood microcirculation.

A number of medical studies done in Japan in the last 20 years have show that FIR can even be used as a therapy for certain diseases including cardiovascular diseases, including chronic heart failure (CHF) and peripheral artery disease (PAD). This approach is called WAON Therapy; WAON means 'Soothing Warmth'. (references can be found here)
Starting from this data I had the idea to develop a new thread/fiber made from bioceramic able to radiate FIR directly on the skin.
Unfortunately, materials and production of this underwear are expensive, we are looking for $30,000 just to start the production of the first batch of shirts.
We are a new company and your Support is fundamental to make our idea grow and became real.
With your contribution we can offer to you as a supporter a price that is considerably lower than the normal retail price.



This underwear is ideal for every endurance sport like running, biking, climbing, mountain biking, etc. but also simply walking. Warm Wild underwear is perfectly suited for difficult conditions, characterized by thermal stress, when thermoregulation is crucial like skiing, cross-country, snowboarding, hiking, diving, and skydiving.
We strongly believe in this project and we will go on developing it even if the support from you will not reach our target but of course it may cause delays and exaggerate costs for us, which is why your contribution is needed so much!

Nature at the Service of Man


FIR - FAR INFRA RED RAYS are the source of energy for all living beings on earth. They lie in the spectrum of sunlight that is also absorbed by the human body and are particularly abundant in the morning sun and at sunset. FIR can penetrate the body by up to 5-7 cm and have healthy powers and beneficial effects that have been proven by many clinical studies and have been know about for more than 30 years.
 How can we take advantage of these benefits? What can we use to make these rays available when no direct solar radiation is present? How to leverage these effects to improve sports performance? How to exploit their thermoregulatory effect to create an innovative underwear that can improve the comfort of the wearer?
The Warm Wild project was born from these questions and addresses these challenges combining technology and innovation. The technology of bioceramic fabrics to create a new technical underwear with unique properties.
 Bioceramic is a material that emits FIR naturally and can be added to textile fibers, it is composed of a mixture of non-toxic mineral oxides such as platinum, titanium, and aluminum, added to the fiber in liquid form to produce fabrics able to exploit all its properties. These fabrics are already used in some fields such as aerospace and medical. Fabrics containing bioceramic are used to cover the inside of the space shuttles to double the energy of sunlight, also astronauts wear tracksuits internally coated with bioceramic fabric.
Once in contact with the body, this kind of fabric also has the ability to reflect FIR naturally emitted by the human body increasing the global effect. Additional benefits of bioceramics are antibacterial and permanent anti-odor characteristics.
 Warmwild technical underwear is made of fabrics containing fibers with different percentages of bioceramics, maintaining the characteristics of lightness, breathability, compression, and elasticity typical of fabrics used for the production of the best technical underwear, but with the added unique bioceramic properties.
 Warm Wild garments come from the combination of the best existing technology coupled with the unique characteristics of Bioceramic. A technical underwear suitable for any kind of activity thanks to the ability of Bioceramic to regulate body temperature and especially effective for those activities characterized by high dynamism and carried out in very cold weather. In these conditions FIR emitted by Bioceramic allow to quickly reach and keep a perfect state of thermal equilibrium by increasing vasodilation and blood microcirculation.
The Fabric

The fabric of the WarmWild sportswear was born from the combination of bioceramic threads and the great design of a high quality fabric from these threads with features that enhance the effect. In order to obtain a unique undergarment we asked an industry leader in the textile industry with more than thirty years of experience to design a fabric with these characteristics.
This led to the creation of the fabric that we called APT®P: Always Perfect Temperature. The APT fabric is able to optimize the effect of thermoregulation of the bioceramics, allowing our athletes to wear the same shirt in cold conditions and extremely hot conditions. People who love sports and practice both summer and winter sports know that often, especially in the mountains, the weather changes very quickly. For this reason we wanted to develop a base layer that would work in every condition, in every season.
So, in addition to the laboratory tests we had a crazy idea. Certain of the quality of our product and the validity of our theories we asked a number of high-level athletes to try out our shirts and give us their testimony with their true feelings after performing their favorite sport. In their tests our shirts were worn in the snow, the summer heat, high altitudes and at sea level.
The WarmWild undershirt proven ideal in all conditions of heat, cold and warm weather. The characteristics of extreme breathability make it the ideal undershirt during exercise allowing the athlete to quickly disperse the heat and sweat. The effect of temperature control maintains the body temperature constant in the optimum range, preventing both dispersions and accumulations of heat and cold, maintaining a perfect temperature. Bioceramic also has an anti-bacterial and anti-odor effect; this, coupled with the ability to regulate he body's temperature keeps you from wearing a smelly, wet t-shirt.
WarmWild, thanks to the extreme comfort of the APT fabric is comfortable to wear, lightweight and snug, without being overly tight/compressive. These features of the APT fabric make the WarmWild undershirt the ideal piece of clothing in all seasons and weather conditions!
We have produced an undergarment with all these features and we are proud and confident that it will become a great sports ally.

HELLO!
Ciao, sono il Dr Giovanni Russo, Cardiologo, fondatore di
Warwild vorrei parlarvi del mio progetto: creare un perfetto abbigliamento
intimo (Underwear) sportivo sfruttando la capacità delle fibre di bioceramica
di riflettere ed emettere Raggi infrarossi (FIR)
Qualunque sport tu stia praticando, a
qualsiasi livello ed in ogni condizione atmosferica hai bisogno di un underwear
confortevole che ti aiuti a mantenere in equilibrio la temperatura corporea.
I Raggi Infrarossi hanno innumerevoli
proprietà, che possono essere sfruttate dal corpo umano, in particolare durante
l’attività fisica. La bioceramica infatti ci aiuta a raggiungere velocemente un
perfetto equilibrio termico, grazie ad un miglioramento della micro
circolazione e ad un’aumentata vasodilatazione superficiale.
Diversi studi clinici condotti in Giappone
negli ultimi 20 anni hanno visto i FIR usati come terapia in diversi disturbi
del nostro corpo. Il nome di questa terapia e’ Waon Theraphy che significa
calore lenitivo.
Partendo da queste informazioni ho avuto l’idea
di sviluppare un nuovo tessuto con bioceramica capace di emetter FIR
direttamente sulla pelle.
Noi siamo una nuova società e il tuo supporto
e’ fondamentale per trasformare la nostra idea in realtà.
Questo underwear e’ ideale per tutti gli
sport come running,bike,mountain bike,anche semplicemente camminare . L’underwear
WarmWild e’ perfetto per condizioni più difficili caratterizzate da stress
termico,quando la termoregolazione ottimale e’ fondamentale,come nello Sci,
Snowboard, alpinismo, ma anche in condizioni di caldo estremo. Per maggiori
informazioni consulta la sezione testimonials del nostro sito
Noi crediamo molto in questo progetto e
andremo avanti a svilupparlo anche se il vostro supporto non raggiungerà il
target previsto. E’ per questo che il vostro contributo e’ per noi
fondamentale.
Grazie
 
LA NATURA AL SERVIZIO DELL’UOMO
I FIR - FAR INFRA RED RAY sono
la fonte di energia di tutti gli esseri viventi sulla terra, corrispondono allo
spettro della luce solare che viene assorbito anche dal nostro organismo. Sono
particolarmente abbondanti nel sole del mattino e della sera. I FIR possono
penetrare nel corpo fino a 5-7 cm e hanno poteri ed effetti salutistici
dimostrati da molti studi clinici e noti da più di 50 anni.
Come sfruttare questi effetti
benefici?
Cosa utilizzare per rendere
questi raggi disponibili anche in assenza di radiazione solare diretta?
Come utilizzare questi effetti
per migliorare le prestazioni sportive?
Come sfruttare il loro effetto
termoregolatore per realizzare un underwear innovativo in grado di migliorare
il comfort di  chi lo indossa?
Il progetto Warmwild nasce da
queste domande e la risposta a queste sfide è il risultato della combinazione
di tecnologia e innovazione. La tecnologia dei tessuti in bioceramica per
realizzare un intimo tecnico con proprietà uniche.
La bioceramica è un materiale
che ha la capacità di emettere naturalmente i FIR e che può essere aggiunta
alle fibre tessili, è composta da una miscela di ossidi minerali atossici come
platino, titanio e alluminio, che viene aggiunta alla fibra in forma liquida
per realizzare tessuti in grado di sfruttarne tutte le proprietà. Questi
tessuti sono già utilizzati in alcuni campi come quello aerospaziale o medico.
I tessuti in bioceramica rivestono l'interno delle navette spaziali per
duplicare l'energia della luce solare così come le tute che indossano gli
astronauti sono rivestite all’interno con tessuto in bioceramica attiva all’infrarosso.
Una volta a contatto con il corpo, il tessuto in bioceramica ha anche la
capacita di riflettere i FIR che naturalmente il nostro corpo emette
incrementandone l’effetto. Ulteriori vantaggi della bioceramica sono le
proprietà antibatteriche ed anti-odore permanenti.
L’intimo tecnico Warmwild è
realizzato con tessuti contenenti fibre con diverse percentuali di bioceramica
che conferiscono ai capi le proprietà peculiari della bioceramica mantenendo le
caratteristiche di leggerezza, traspirabilità, compressione ed elasticità
tipici dei tessuti usati per il confezionamento del  miglior technical underwear.
I capi Warmwild sono il risultato
della combinazione della miglior tecnologia esistente per la realizzazione di
intimo tecnico abbinata alle caratteristiche uniche della bioceramica. Un
intimo tecnico adatto ad ogni tipo di attività grazie alle proprietà
termoregolatrici della bioceramica e particolarmente efficace per attività
caratterizzate da alta dinamicità e svolte in condizioni di freddo intenso. In
queste condizioni gli effetti di vasodilatazione e aumento del microcircolo
sanguigno dei FIR emessi dalla bioceramica consentono di raggiungere in breve
tempo una situazione di equilibrio termico e di mantenerla.
 
I TESSUTI
L’abbigliamento sportivo intimo Warm Wild®
nasce dalla combinazione tra il filato in bioceramica e la creazione di un
tessuto innovativo con caratteristiche tali da esaltarne l’effetto. Per
poter ottenere un underwear tecnico unico ci siamo rivolti ad un leader di settore
nel campo del tessile, con esperienza trentennale, per disegnare un
tessuto con queste caratteristiche. Questo ha portato alla creazione del
tessuto che abbiamo chiamato APT®: Always Perfect Temperature.
Il tessuto APT® è in grado di ottimizzare l’effetto
di termoregolazione della bioceramica, consentendo ai nostri atleti di
indossare la medesima maglietta sia in condizione di freddo che di caldo
estremo. Chi ama lo sport infatti lo pratica sia in inverno che in estate e sa perfettamente
che spesso, soprattutto in montagna, il clima cambia molto rapidamente,
per tale ragione abbiamo voluto sviluppare un capo che funzionasse in ogni
condizione, in ogni stagione, per ogni sport.
Quindi, oltre ai test di laboratorio, abbiamo
avuto un’idea folle. Certi della validità del nostro prodotto, abbiamo chiesto
ai testimonial di utilizzare
le medesime magliette per svolgere i loro sport preferiti in qualunque
condizione climatica, sono state quindi indossate sulla neve così come in
giorni di intenso caldo estivo, sia in altura che a livello del mare.
L’intimo Warm Wild® si è dimostrato ideale in
ogni condizione di caldo, di freddo o di temperatura mite. le
caratteristiche di estrema traspirabilità rendono l’intimo Warm Wild®
ideale durante l’attività fisica consentendo all’atleta di disperdere
rapidamente il calore ed il sudore. L’effetto di termoregolazione mantiene
la temperatura corporea costante nel range ottimale, impedendo nello
stesso momento sia dispersioni estreme di calore in caso di freddo che
accumuli di calore fastidiosi in caso di caldo. L’effetto
antibatterico ed antiodore della bioceramica unito alla elevata capacità
di dispersione del calore e di ottimizzazione della sudorazione attraverso
la termoregolazione, consente un utilizzo costante o continuativo dei capi
Warm Wild® senza il fastidioso problema del cattivo odore o della
sensazione di bagnato sulla pelle. l’intimo Warm Wild® grazie all’estremo
comfort del tessuto APT® risulta piacevole da indossare, leggero, comodo
ed aderente senza essere eccessivamente compressivo.
Queste caratteristiche rendono il tessuto APT®
e l’intimo Warm Wild® il capo di abbigliamento ideale in ogni stagione e
condizione climatica con un notevole risparmio sui costi di abbigliamento
complessivo.
Abbiamo prodotto un capo intimo, con tutte queste
caratteristiche orgogliosi e convinti che possa diventare il vostro
miglior alleato per lo sport.

quality. Every detail matters, and each insole is an unique creation.
I also work with qualified and passionate craftsmen that take part in writing Red Carpet’s story every day. 





  Now, I need YOU
After two successful years in launching the product in France, I am up for a new challenge:  I need to finance my growth and want to expand the range to even more innovative products! I want women to feel beautiful and comfortable in their stilettos, and feel like stars on the Red Carpet.
I need your support to finance this new step and help me get my product to all women. 
Your contribution will help me :
- attending international trade shows to present the product, and get some exposure to find distributors for Red Carpet
- investing in new products development.
- Invest in my production so that I can be competitive on international markets



 Your perks :-)
Your support is very valuable to me, I want to share this great adventure with you by giving you the opportunity to support my start-up. 
 I have prepared really glamourous rewards for those who will contribute.
For example:
- ""Red Carpet loves you"" stickers, shoe bags..etc
- Free pairs of the ""Red Carpet loves you"" limited edition (full or open-toe insoles with a specific logo)
- Your initials on our best seller Red insole, in gold 22 carats, just like a red carpet celebrity! 
- One year of Red Carpet!
- Meet and greet day to say thank you or a shopping day in Paris! 










 Other Ways You Can Help...
Well, if you can't contribute, please spread the word around you! It's very important to drive the brand awareness!  My web site is www.redcarpet-paris.com. 

Maybe you know the buyers of some very famous department stores who would pick up my product? Of a renowned journalist who could help me spread the word about my product?
I am counting on you to help me !

</div></div>","What we are doing
We are a young Canadian family company committed in creating stylish footwear that is eco & animal friendly.  Reusing over recycling, walking over driving short distances, eating organics and being vegans are just a few of the things we do at Colourful Grass.  We also organize Veggie BBQ in the theme ""Earth Day"" to spread vegan ideas. Although we are all those things and more, Colourful Grass is about planting a different kind of seed.  

 

 

 
Colourful Grass shoes are comfortable, affordable and stylish. 

2012 Premier Collection:
 

    

 
        Brigid - Bumblebee               Brigid - Earth           
 

      *Brigid also available in Black colour. We will update the picture soon.
 



          Doris - Rose                       Doris - Chestnut              Catherine - Redish  
 
*Heart shape coconut button will apply to Doris Chestnut, please refer to Doris Rose)             

             
 
Existing Styles 2011 (If you see anything you really like, let us know):

 
The above footwear will also be available in multiple colors and we will do our best to post more pictures as we go along. Our shoes are made with Hemp Canvas, Organic cotton, PU, Recycled rubber and even coconut shell buttons to create style. 
Our footwear is available for both men (sizes 7-12) & women (sizes 5 -11) 
They Spoke & We listened

We spent close to 2 years talking to the consumers even before the beginning stages of product development. We asked people like you and me what they like in a cute pair of shoes, why and, what they would like to see in a pair of eco friendly shoe. They asked for vegan shoes, recycled soles, fashion shoes beyond sandals, eco shoes that are stylish and have a metropolitan style and most of all comfortable eco shoes that can be dresses up and/or worn with casually! The feedback we received was the fuel in the development & creation of Colourful Grass.
In that short period of time, we have gained close to 10,000 followers on Twitter and over 400 fans on Facebook. We have been featured in various publications, blogs, mailed shoes to celebs and had TV interviews. These are just the beginnings…

Why Colourful Grass
Born with a strong love for the animals to travelling the world to beautiful sandy beaches with clear waters, to eating fresh food from local farms, going on a nice hike through the mountains, and hanging out at the park with our dog are just a few of the many things that are the “why” behind the development of Colourful Grass. How devastating would it be to go outside and not be able to breathe fresh air or go to the park and barely be able to touch & feel the grass due to the amount of garbage pollution and/or to not be able to receive clean drinking water and fresh food? Having a little one, I can’t imagine what it would be like to know that I could have made a difference today so that our children of tomorrow can enjoy and share the same things we do today.   Nature is part of us and who we are as individuals. It is our duty to protect all its living things on it and, take responsibility today. Any contribution & support you offer Colourful Grass will go a long way and we thank you in advance.
(make sure you watch our video for statistics and information on why our shoes are animal  & eco friendly)

You will be the very first to get your hands on the anycuff. 

Fashion is important to you and the anycuff allows you to revolutionize how you accessorize your existing wardrobe.

You've never had the ease of mind of wearing cufflinks in a busy lifestyle where rolling your sleeves up and down is a regular thing and removing traditional cufflinks may be a hassle. 
  We  have a very strong relationship with the manufacturer whom has well over 8 years of cufflink manufacturing experience. The Anycuff is patented, molds are finished, and packaging is secured. At most, a one month production period is expected once the Anycuff Indiegogo campaign is completed. We feel confident in our relationships with the manufacturers and our ability to deliver on time. How well do the cufflink's stay together on the
cuff throughout the day?

Quite well. We made sure to choose the strongest
magnets available to ensure a strong
long-lasting bond. Of course as you would expect, because they’re magnets, you
can pull them apart when needed. If they do come apart, it takes a second or
two to click them back together.

Will the cufflink pieces fall off easily when
not magnetically attracted?

Absolutely not. We have gone through a large
number of different prototypes to ensure that both of the cufflink pieces stay securely fastened to your shirt sleeve.

Do the magnets in the cufflink's disrupt watches?

We have placed our cufflink's directly on top of
some Kenneth Cole and Fossil watches for 2 solid weeks and noticed no abnormal
activity. Sometimes the magnet can catch the “second” hand for a brief moment but
overall it did not significantly impact the watch accuracy. We have not however
tested them on more high end, electronic or kinetic watches.

Do you have any other designs?

This limited edition design is the only one we
have produced thus far. Once the Indiegogo campaign is finished, we plan to
begin manufacturing other designs as well, of which we do have some in mind
already.

Can you wear them on French cuff shirts?

Only under certain circumstances. Some French cuff
shirts have very thick sleeves making it impossible for the Anycuff to go
through all of the button holes without significant strain. If the French cuff
shirt sleeves are quite thin, then the Anycuff could be worn on French cuff
shirts.",36.0,1,"1 Campaign

<div>After sewing as a hobby for five years, I received enough sales to start <b>manufacturing my designs with a family Ghana 2014</b> .

<div>The main source of income for the family I manufacture with was in the travel and tourism industry.

</div></div>","50 Dresses to New York Fashion Week!





My name is Ashley and I'm a young designer who was invited to New York Fashion Week about a month ago.  It came as a complete shock.  I wasn't expecting it as a growing brand, but knew instantly that it was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. The event in one of the largest on the fashion calendar for African-inspired designers.  I will be showcasing my new collection 50 Shades of Ankara at New York Fashion Week: Africa in September and I need to sell 50 dresses to help me get there.  At this point the collection is complete the lookbook is ready, but I just need to make sure I can return home with good credit and the ability to continue to pay people fair wages for doing amazing work.  

Fair Trade: It's Not Just Me:

After sewing as a hobby for five years, I received enough sales to start manufacturing my designs with a family Ghana 2014 . This happened largely from the sales of THE ZHARA Dress,  a design that has been worn by the likes of DJ Spinderella from the iconic hip hop group Salt & Peppa and Claire Sulmers of the mega multicultural fashion blog Fashion Bomb Daily.


The main source of income for the family I manufacture with was in the travel and tourism industry. After the travel restrictions placed on the Ghana and other parts of West Africa during the Ebola Crisis of 2014, they needed to find a new means to make money.  They now employ young women in the community to sew garments at wages that are fair and equitable. 

Doing New York Fashion Week: Africa will help give me the exposure to develop my brand into a sustainable mainstay in the fashion world, and assist me in continuing to provide these jobs.

$3,550 for NYFW:A Registration 
$1,550 for 50% of Fabric
$250 for the Flight

$500 for Additional Travel and Food

<h3>What Is LifeBrush? A Smarter Toothbrush!<br/>
</h3>
Ever been to the dentist and been surprised when you received bad news?  You may have thought you were brushing correctly, but how can you <i>really </i>know?<br/><br/>We created LifeBrush so that you <b>can</b> really know.<br/><br/>LifeBrush
is an ultrasonic toothbrush that knows its position in your mouth and shows you exactly where you brushed and for how long.  It will send that information to your mobile device through Bluetooth LE which will in turn be displayed in our app.   The brushing statistics and history will show you where you missed thereby giving you a better chance to remove plaque, avoid cavities, and avoid gum disease.<br/><br/>(<b>Fact</b>: Remove plaque every 24-hours and you should never get a cavity.) <br/><br/>We are also  developing a built-in thermometer for LifeBrush so that when you finish brushing your teeth you will know your body temperature. This will enable early detection of spikes in body temperature.  This will really help mothers with monitoring their child's health.<br/><br/>Imagine your life with no more:<br/><ul>
<li>surprises of bad news from the dentist.</li>
<li>wondering whether or not your child brushed correctly.</li>
<li>wondering whether or not your child has a fever.  </li>
</ul>LifeBrush can be so much more than a toothbrush.  Join us in making it a reality!</div><div style=""""><br/></div><div style=""text-align: center;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1257225/files/20150228172136-LogoForIndiegogoNoWords.png?1425172896"" src="""" style=""width: 343.944px; height: 281px;""/></p></div><div style=""""><br/></div><div style="""">

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Dr. Richter continuously looks for ways to improve the health of his patients and pitched an idea to one of his patients, <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/profile/public-profile-settings?trk=prof-edit-edit-public_profile"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Stacy Hawkins</a>, using the infamous words: ""I have an idea for an app.""</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Dr. Richter wanted to help families gain better access to dental care--no matter who their dentist was.  He didn't see it as helping his competitors.  He saw it as helping families!  Stacy agreed to help him (by using what he had learned in getting his business degree) and the two began putting together a team to develop an app to help moms, kids and all those who either struggle with getting to the dentist or want the best health available.</span><br/></p>

<p><span>The app evolved into a much bigger idea: a smart toothbrush! Dr. Richter knew that most dental complications are the result of poor brushing habits.

<p>The best thing about LifeBrush is that it's a cool idea that will do a lot of good.  Help us get LifeBrush out of development and into the hands of people.  LifeBrush is not yet for sale.  But you can <b>get a LifeBrush as a perk </b>for helping us reach our goal.<br/></p>
<p><span>We need to raise $65,000 to polish the prototype and finish the software.  If we do not reach our goal we will use what you do give us to get closer to reaching these objectives.  We are asking you to help us make a difference!</span></p>
<p>
</p>
If we do not reach our goal here we will get as close to finished as the money will allow then we will beat the pavement to find ways to get this brush to market.  We have already done quite a bit of work, and we just need a little help from you to help us get over this hump.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Cavities and gum disease are a silent <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2821841/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">epidemic</a>. When <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6203a21.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">almost half of the people over 30 have gum disease</a> that means the problem didn't just start.  But, we do the best that we can.  The problem is we need a better tool to let us know when we didn't brush well enough and to let us know where we need to brush in order to brush well enough....to slay the dragon. LifeBrush will provide that, and will help in other areas.<br/></p>
<p>Kids
don’t want mom in the bathroom hovering over them as they brush their teeth.  But, mom wants to make sure her child is brushing correctly.  This is a key point in
a child’s development, as statistics show that bad brushing habits acquired during childhood will usually carry on into adulthood.</p>

<p></p>
<p><span><span>This pattern has made

birth just to name a few.

On a lighter note,  we are planning to add a <b>KissAbility Score</b> for those who want to know that the person they are kissing isn't passing a mouthful of yesterday's bacteria...eewww!  For kids this score will be called the <b>Cavity Warrior Score</b>.

</div></div>","What Is LifeBrush? A Smarter Toothbrush!

Ever been to the dentist and been surprised when you received bad news?  You may have thought you were brushing correctly, but how can you really know?We created LifeBrush so that you can really know.LifeBrush
is an ultrasonic toothbrush that knows its position in your mouth and shows you exactly where you brushed and for how long.  It will send that information to your mobile device through Bluetooth LE which will in turn be displayed in our app.   The brushing statistics and history will show you where you missed thereby giving you a better chance to remove plaque, avoid cavities, and avoid gum disease.(Fact: Remove plaque every 24-hours and you should never get a cavity.) We are also  developing a built-in thermometer for LifeBrush so that when you finish brushing your teeth you will know your body temperature. This will enable early detection of spikes in body temperature.  This will really help mothers with monitoring their child's health.Imagine your life with no more:
surprises of bad news from the dentist.
wondering whether or not your child brushed correctly.
wondering whether or not your child has a fever.  
LifeBrush can be so much more than a toothbrush.  Join us in making it a reality!
Who We Are

Dr. William Richter doesn’t just do small talk with his patients.  He gets to know them personally.  His patients become his friends.  In fact, 2 of his patients have pitched in to help him realize his dream.  This is the story behind LifeBrush.
Dr. Richter continuously looks for ways to improve the health of his patients and pitched an idea to one of his patients, Stacy Hawkins, using the infamous words: ""I have an idea for an app."" Dr. Richter wanted to help families gain better access to dental care--no matter who their dentist was.  He didn't see it as helping his competitors.  He saw it as helping families!  Stacy agreed to help him (by using what he had learned in getting his business degree) and the two began putting together a team to develop an app to help moms, kids and all those who either struggle with getting to the dentist or want the best health available.


The app evolved into a much bigger idea: a smart toothbrush! Dr. Richter knew that most dental complications are the result of poor brushing habits. He figured that with better technology, toothbrushes should be smart enough to fix bad brushing behavior. We decided to name it ""LifeBrush"" because it impacts more than the couple of minutes it takes to brush your teeth.  Reinforcing good brushing habits will positively impact your whole life. 
The Mid-Michigan Innovation Center joined to help Dr. Richter move closer to reaching his dream, then came Steinbrink Engineering (Nevin, Nick and Mike) to help with the mechanical parts of the brush and they were followed thereafter by the University of Michigan's Pediatric Device Consortium (who said they would provide direction). Dr. Richter then reached out to a former patient, Kyle Rokita, who was back in town to build our mobile app.

 Lauro Ojeda,  University of Michigan Research Scientist specialized in inertial 
localization systems, enthusiastically jumped in to develop the 
complicated algorithms for tracking the brush location inside the mouth.
 And, then there was Patti DiGangi, a nationally known expert in the dental profession and a passionate force for oral cancer awareness and prevention (1% of amount raised here will be donated to The Oral Cancer Foundation).

<p>I started the <i>XtendPower</i> project in my dorm room because my roommates and I could not find a simple solution for charging our devices. I have always been a do-it-yourself kind of guy, so I decided to create a device that could be used to conveniently power multiple devices using standard outlets while at the same time utilizing USB charging ports.</p>
<p>The outlets in our dorm were either hidden under furniture or tucked away in a corner. We were constantly connecting and disconnecting our laptops, phones, and tablets in the outlet closest to the couch, because we all wanted to be within arms reach of our devices. We tried everything from basic power strips, extension cords, and multiple wall outlet adapters, but nothing seemed to be the perfect fit. I wanted to find a convenient way for my friends and I to charge our devices.</p>
<p>My first self-made prototype consisted of one of those industrial orange extension cords, which was then plugged into a power strip. Due to the power bricks and adapters overlapping, we were not able to utilize all 6 of the outlets in the power strip. Not only did this look like something from ""<i>Back To The Future,""</i> but it was inconvenient and somewhat dangerous. The USB power bricks took up the much needed conventional outlets to charge our laptops. It was impossible for all of us to charge all of our devices simultaneously. My friend who is an interior designer, always joked about how our coffee table looked like an engineering lab.</p>

<p>I was lucky to have a family friend with experience in the manufacturing industry, and a brother who is an electrical engineer. With their help we were able to make my idea a reality.

<p><b>XtendPower starts shipping in January, 2015!</b></p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to read through my pitch. I'm here on Indiegogo because I need your help to complete this project. I believe that <i>XtendPower</i> is the best product of its type in the industry today. Its compact, good looking and loaded with features that include our exclusive tamper resistant outlet design and 90 degree pass through plug. <i>XtendPower</i> conveniently  powers multiple devices using standard outlets while at the same time utilizing USB charging ports. And here is the best part, it costs about the same as what you would pay for a conventional power strip that lacks most of the features of <i>XtendPower</i>. Check out our perks to see just what an amazing deal XtendPower really is. I'm trying my best to let the world know about <i>XtendPower</i>. I am truly thankful for those of you who like the product and would like to help us to get our message out. We would love to see our Indiegogo campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Blogs or any other type of social media! With your assistance we can make XtendPower a reality! </p>
<p><b>Thank you Indiegogo!</b></p>
</div></div>","XtendPower comes in matte black or white.


XtendCables come in your choice of white or black, with either MicroUSB or iPhone Lightning connector.Shorter cable: magnetic ends can tie (like a loop, see pic above) for awesome portability!
Longer cable: indicator LED shows you the status of your device's charge. Red means charging & blue means fully charged. It also comes with built-in silicon cable tie. 


XtendPower is the most versatile, safe, and convenient way to charge all of your devices at the same time. We created XtendPower to replace your old power strips, extension cords, and socket extenders. XtendPower is a revolutionary charging station that enables you to charge up to six devices simultaneously using two USB ports, four standard outlets, and a pass through plug. XtendPower is beautifully designed which means there is no need for it to be hidden. No matter the decor, it looks great in any situation where you need to access power! 


Sleek design and compact size.
XtendPower has a six foot heavy duty power cord, allowing you to reach virtually any point in the room. With the convenience of a six foot cord, XtendPower can be plugged into the corner outlet, and sit atop a coffee table, allowing you to charge a phone, tablet, and laptop directly in front of you.

Looks great on your coffee table.


Comes with adhesive pad, so you can mount XtendPower anywhere.XtendPower also has a sleek 45 degree plug so that the cord can fit behind furniture and its unique plug through feature is designed so that the outlet can still be used without having to unplug XtendPower. 

45 degree pass through plug.
To keep it compact, yet functional, XtendPower has four outlets and two USB charging ports. XtendPower can charge a phone and a tablet at the same time by sensing the additional power requirements needed and sharing that power between the two devices. The outlets are spaced to allow for oversized brick shaped power adapters to sit side by side, a feature unique to XtendPower. 

Capable of charging a phone and a tablet at the same time.
Each year thousands of children are injured by inserting objects into outlets. We have eliminated that potential risk by designing the XtendPower with tamper resistant outlets, another feature unique to XtendPower. In addition we have added overload protection making XtendPower one of the safest products of its type.  

Large adapters can be used side by side.
XtendPower is also energy efficient, utilizing an ON/OFF/Reset switch in order to save power consumption when XtendPower is not in use. With other devices, the USB charging ports can be running 24/7 regardless of whether or not they are being used. This is often referred to as vampire, or phantom power loss.

you for stopping by!  We’re so glad you

Mission
We’re
on a mission.  We need your help to start
our new solar energy system business.  We
have an innovative system that provides many extra benefits to our customers at
a lower cost than comparable solar PV systems on the market today.  We would like to get to market faster than we
can afford to right now and with your help, we can do just that.  We also want to put lots of people back to
work.
Our Product
Our
system works differently than most of today’s systems.  It has a group of 1 foot square mirrors
mounted on the roof that track the sun and reflect it to the top of a chimney
target.  This chimney holds that heat in
a storage tank for up to a few days so a generator can produce electricity from
it all day and night.
The
amount of electricity made is matched to exactly what you want at any time.  This can completely eliminate your electric
bill and even your grid connection if you want.
The
extra heat that’s not used will also heat many things to eliminate your natural
gas bill too.  This includes things like
your home heating, water heating, pool or hot tub heating and operating a
certain kind of air conditioner.  It even
has a built-in barbecue that’s powered by this heat!
The
system has lots of flexibility in how to configure it.  This means you can put it on any side of the
house, over a patio or even on the ground. 
You just need the space and a good view of the sun.  It also means that it works well in hot and
cold climates, winter and summer.  It has
a built-in heater to clear snow and frost from the mirrors and a backup system
to cover those spells when the sun hides away for many days in a row.
UPDATE:  We now have some wonderful volunteers working
hard to bring you an animation of the system very soon so be sure to watch for
it!  We’re hoping to see it in the next
few days and we’ll put it up as soon as we get it.  (THANKS GUYS!!!)
Behind the scenes
The
heart of the system is our new Stirling engine. 
We are developing our 5th generation of it now but running short of
development funds.  Previous versions
have worked better than expected but have cost more than $100k to build.  Now with the availability of a special
ceramic, we can cut that cost dramatically. 
This is huge news because it means that it’s now possible to be able to
offer the complete system for $20k. 
Adding the install cost will put your total cost around $25k.
When
you couple electricity generation with heat production, it’s called combined
heat and power or CHP.  This type of
system basically doubles a system’s value. 
Running it from storage allows this to all happen 24 hours a day, regardless
of sunlight.  This triples a systems
value again.  It basically solves all the
problems people have with other renewable energy systems while eliminating the
need for batteries that must be maintained or replaced.
When
you compare this one-time cost to monthly energy bills of $300-$500 per month
(and climbing), it could be paid off in 6-10 years.  After that, you can enjoy free energy with
only periodic maintenance checks.  We’ve
designed the whole system so every part is either maintenance free or very
cheap to repair.  For example, any mirror
can be replaced for about $1 in 5 minutes! 
Since repair costs are so cheap, there’s not really a system lifetime.
Our Story
Welcome
to the introduction of my life's mission.  I've been interested in
creating this system for 30 years and have been focused solely on it for the
last 10.  As an ex-automation engineer, I've been able to combine my
experiences with lots of new research and the wonderful help of a small group
of talented experts, to finally create the ultimate home energy system.
It's
been a very expensive and time-consuming road, but it's all been worth it.
 I've made many new friends, both local and all over the internet.
 We've all shared the work and some have stayed for the long haul.
We've
spent many nights emailing drawings or spreadsheets around, skyping til 3 am
and getting up for work in 2 hours and we've dumped all the money we could get
our hands on (more than we should have) into making new versions of this or
that part for tests.
Now
our genuinely crowd-sourced group consists of a handful of
40-somethings and some 20-somethings spread all over the internet plus a few of
our kids with a common goal.  That goal is to bring a genuinely affordable
energy system to the public which satisfies every energy need people have,
while powering itself from the one resource we all have - the sun.  
Funding
We
are very supportive of the crowd-funding and crowd-sourcing movement.  For us, it can allow us to keep our system
price low.  This way we can help many
more people cut their energy costs. 
Investment costs would quickly double our price and kill the business
before it got started.
By
way of your generous donations, we can purchase some needed equipment and materials.  This will get us set up for making a few
systems to sell.  Those sales are already
here, pending completion of a full sized field test system so we need that
funded as well.  Unfortunately, the
rugged economy has hit our small town harder than most.  It’s a manufacturing based community, nestled
in a farming state.  While our state is
doing well, our town has lost every major industry we’ve had over the years.
This
project can not only change that for our little community, it can generate many
high paying jobs all over the country.  The
faster we get going, the more impact these systems will have to cut our fossil
fuel usage and we all know a bunch of reasons to do that so don’t be shy!  You’ll sleep much better tonight, knowing you
did something to help all this get started.
Don’t
forget to ask questions in the comments or just say hi.  Even Liking and Sharing can be a big help to
spread the word.  This may get better
response once we get our video released, but every little bit counts so if you
support a more sustainable energy direction, it’s time to get busy!

The Redoutable, first French nuclear submarine, could, they say, sail around the world without ever rising to the surface.Initialement conçues pour le personnel militaire lors de missions sous-marines, les montres 24h aidaient les marins, comme ils étaient privés de la lumière du jour, à s'orienter dans le temps. Le Redoutable, premier sous-marin nucléaire français, pouvait, dit-on, faire le tour de la Terre sans jamais remonter à la surface.Le Redoutable - 1967THE PRESENT / LE PRÉSENT--Based in Bordeaux, city known for its wine but also for its naval history, our brand claims to be from various origins. Aesthetically inspired by Bauhaus and its significant minimalism, prototyped in France, Vasco is working with a high quality Swiss Heart ( Ronda Swiss Made Quartz 515.24H ), a 316L Stainless Steel case , a scratch-resistant sapphire glass and the whole enhanced by french bull leather bracelets.Basée à Bordeaux, ville au passé naval et sous-marinier, notre marque se revendique d’origines diverses. Marquée esthétiquement par l’école du Bauhaus et son minimalismesignificatif, prototypée localement en France, Vasco embarque un coeur suisse de haute qualité (Ronda Quartz Swiss Made 515.24H), un boitier en acier inoxydable 316L, un verre saphir inrayable et le tout mis en valeur par des bracelets en cuir de taureau français.Click to enlarge

<h1>Why?</h1>
<p>We need your help to launch Spaced Out Shop off the ground! <br/></p>
<p>Our online store <a href=""http://www.SpacedOutShop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.SpacedOutShop.com</a> has recently gone live, but as you know, the hard part in starting a new business is getting customers and sales rolling in.<br/></p>
<p>That's why we've started this crowdfunding campaign offering limited designs. We need to raise money and generate the fuel to keep the business thrusting forward through its early stages.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you're not only supporting a small business to get started, you're scoring a quality t-shirt that very few people in the universe will own.</p>
<p>Be one of our first customers, help us a launch this rocket, and be a part of our journey into the future.</p>

<p>Hello!  My name is Viktor Luna, a recent contestant and finalist on Project Runway Season 9. </p>
<p>I was born in Guadalajara, Mexico and raised in Los Angeles.  At a young age my mother taught me the foundation of how to create a garment.  Ever since, my interest in the fashion world has increased.  I have always had the desire to design, and therefore decided to move to New York City where I would pursue an education in fashion.  I enrolled in the Fashion Institute of Technology and took numerous courses for a year.  Going forward, I was given the opportunity to intern at Zero Maria Cornejo where I obtained most of my design knowledge and production.  Following my internship, I was inspired to start my own clothing line.  Just like many others, I continue to face an everyday battle of maintaing a continuous collection on a very small budget.  However, my determination and devotion to what I do strengthens my attitude and self confidence.  </p>
<p>Many of my friends encouraged me to audition for Project Runway.  I did not think I was quite at the level to compete on live television.  At the same time I was trying to put the idea of Project Runway out of my head, I couldn't help but wonder what the experience would be like.  Randomly seeing the casting call on Facebook made me think about it even harder:  Maybe it's fate.  Anyway, it's only a show...it can't hurt me; it might be a great experience.  I continued to put the idea off for as long as I could and oddly enough, on the exact day of the casting, I made an impulsive final decision.  I grabbed my garment bag filled with all my previous work and ran out the door! </p>
<p>Arriving at the show, I was full of nerves.  The first round was probably the most nerve wracking experience of my life.  Surely enough, I passed round one and was more than ready to conquer my battles in round two.  Here, I was able to show the judges more about who I am and what kind of work I do.  Nearing the end of season 9, I was cast as one of the finalists. </p>
<p>Project Runway is known to be a torturous journey, but during my time there I was in heaven.  I loved spending my time in the workroom with the other creative contestants as well as doing what I love!  It gave me the opportunity to challenge myself to do bigger and more complex things while having the luxury to receive critiques from experts in the fashion industry.  The most touching aspect was the kind, but honest, responses that I received about my designs.  That was the key factor that encouraged me to proudly present my creations to millions of fans and fashionistas.  I was given the opportunity to launch my collection during the Mercedes-Benz fashion week. Taking part in that milestone was an unforgettable experience and a dream come true.  My experience at Project Runway was absolutely incredible, and I have no regrets!</p>
<p>The most gratifying aspect of being a designer is watching all of my hard work and finished products come to life as clients, celebrities, and supportive fans invest in some of my pieces and wear them!  I am very driven and take all my designing very seriously. Nothing makes me happier than to see people enjoying my designs as much as I do.</p>
<p>The Viktor Luna brand was founded in 2008 and has been gradually developing into great success with the help of Project Runway, fans, supporters, family, and friends! </p>

That's just what we've done with our Technical Collection. These bags are amazing as you will see when you scroll down. They are made from super heavy-duty materials with hours of thought put into every detail. They are padded, protected, proportioned, and sized to function perfectly for all your carry and travel needs.</p><p>But on top of all that we wanted something more. We started thinking ""out of the box"" (or out of the bag) of a way to make cleaner bags. Bags that would stand with us in a germ-filled world.

You can fit sooo much stuff in here! But it's how the bag is designed that makes the difference. The magnetic secured laptop compartment allows for one hand removal and stow - no more need for that third hand.  And it is large (holds up to a 16""), padded with EVA foam, and and lined in soft faux-fur.

That's just what we've done with our Technical Collection. These bags are amazing as you will see when you scroll down. They are made from super heavy-duty materials with hours of thought put into every detail. They are padded, protected, proportioned, and sized to function perfectly for all your carry and travel needs.But on top of all that we wanted something more. We started thinking ""out of the box"" (or out of the bag) of a way to make cleaner bags. Bags that would stand with us in a germ-filled world. And that's just what we did.This anti-microbial technology targets harmful microbes by altering their ability to convert nutrients into energy, inhibiting microbial survival and reproduction.Think about how many things your bag comes into contact with every day - it's not a pretty picture. Now more than ever, we need to be as sanitary as possible. Our bags are right there with you. Everywhere you go, the bags are working to help reduce germs and promote better hygiene.We also have an innovative pocket designed into the top of the bags that will hold a remote charging block, so you don't have to worry about using those unsanitary public charging stations - if they will even exist anymore.If you want to know more details about our Anti-Microbial technology, please scroll to the bottom and get your science game on!So take a look at all the amazing features of these bags and we think you'll see why we are so excited to bring them to market.The BackpackOur Backpack is an engineering marvel. You can fit sooo much stuff in here! But it's how the bag is designed that makes the difference. The magnetic secured laptop compartment allows for one hand removal and stow - no more need for that third hand.  And it is large (holds up to a 16""), padded with EVA foam, and and lined in soft faux-fur. All the  inside pockets and organizers are sized specifically to fit hard drives, power packs, etc. The interior divider allows you more space for a tablet while still keeping the roomy main compartment free for all your daily needs. There is a hideaway rainfly, a exterior utility strap, luggage handle pass through for travel on a roller suitcase, a lay-flat water bottle holder,  and a combo passport/phone pocket.

They partnered with Lilian Gabriel De Almeida Barbosa, a fashion designer with a background in physical therapy, who embraced the challenge of designing a line of activewear that is loose-fitting and stylish, without compromising on sports and fitness performance.</p><p>After a rigorous process of sketching, multiple visits to factories around the world to identify suitable trade partners and numerous prototype iterations, a first collection of Oola sportswear is now ready to be produced. The first phase of production will include the various headpieces and the multisport top. The next phases will include additional styles of sports tops, trousers and jackets.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474706450/tvlwk5w6hwderphgaqhv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>CO-FOUNDERS BIOs</h3><p><i><strong>HAYA AL GHANIM</strong></i></p><p>CEO, Co-founder</p><p>A Qatari tech buff and amateur athlete with a love for the outdoors, Haya knows how hard it is to find sportswear that is modest, modern and functional. Starting later in the game, Haya began her fitness journey at age 28. She was inspired by a 78 year-old who crossed the finish line during the Boston Marathon in 2013, “I thought, what an accomplishment. I’m 28 and can’t even fathom having to run a 10K, let alone a full marathon.” </p><p>Oola Sportswear is the brainchild of Haya’s desire to enjoy the great outdoors while staying inline with her values and culture. “My drive is a result of being able to provide Muslim women with a whole new experience in sports and fitness.” After tireless shopping sprees at major sports stores and a whole lot of creativity (and luck), Haya often found herself having to mix and match a lot of pieces from various stores to make an outfit work.</p><p>Haya hopes that Oola Sportwear will make room for women in the Muslim world to feel comfortable while enjoying outdoor sports as well as lower the barrier to entry for women looking to compete in sports professionally. </p><p>When Haya is not outdoors working up a sweat, she coaches tech entrepreneurs, mentoring them to launch their own businesses. She holds an MBA from MIT Sloan School of Management. Haya enjoys cycling, hiking, kayaking, and running.</p><p><i><strong>AMINA AHMADI</strong></i></p><p>Design &amp; Product Development Director, Co-founder</p><p>An architect, design thinker and a self-proclaimed hiking fiend, Amina struggled with finding sportswear that was lightweight, breathable and modest. “Not finding suitable clothing for outdoor sports while remaining within the realm of my values was frustrating and often led to me not participating in a number of outdoor activities.”</p><p>Intimidated by sports from an early age, Amina’s interest for fitness was sparked later on in life at age 29. It wasn’t until February 2012, when Amina discovered her passion for fitness and health. “I enrolled in a weeklong program included a daily training, mountain hikes, healthy eating and relaxation. Joining outdoor activities and being immersed in nature with views that would take anyone’s breath away, I was hooked. Hiking had now become my addiction.” Amina continued to travel and made sure to incorporate hiking into almost every trip. </p><p>On January 1st, 2015, Amina became one of many to summit Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, as part of a fundraising campaign for Palestine Children’s Relief Fund.

Unisex Oola T-shirtPERKS FUNDING MILESTONESWe put a lot of love in fashioning our elegant and efficient products -- our first testers agree. We have invested our life savings in researching fabrics, designing a first collection of outfits, producing several iterations of prototypes and towards a down payment for production. We are crowdfunding to help us raise the additional funds required to complete production. Our target of $15,000 will be used to produce headpieces, the multisport top and the hiking top. Exceeding our funding target will enable us to include more products in the campaign.  OUR STORYMeet the team behind Oola:The idea of Oola germinated at the top of Mount Kilimanjaro, where two friends, Haya Al Ghanim and Amina Ahmadi (the co-founders of Oola) saw each other's journey to reach the summit in clothing that was appropriate for the climb, but didn't give them the coverage they would have desired. For both, an outdoor run or ride entails tireless shopping sprees at major sports stores and a whole lot of creativity (and luck). Haya and Amina often found themselves having to mix and match a lot of pieces from various stores to make an outfit work - which costs a fortune!They quickly realised this was a common issue faced by women who feel more comfortable in looser-fitted, long sleeved sportswear made of technical fabrics. They partnered with Lilian Gabriel De Almeida Barbosa, a fashion designer with a background in physical therapy, who embraced the challenge of designing a line of activewear that is loose-fitting and stylish, without compromising on sports and fitness performance.After a rigorous process of sketching, multiple visits to factories around the world to identify suitable trade partners and numerous prototype iterations, a first collection of Oola sportswear is now ready to be produced. The first phase of production will include the various headpieces and the multisport top. The next phases will include additional styles of sports tops, trousers and jackets.CO-FOUNDERS BIOsHAYA AL GHANIMCEO, Co-founderA Qatari tech buff and amateur athlete with a love for the outdoors, Haya knows how hard it is to find sportswear that is modest, modern and functional. Starting later in the game, Haya began her fitness journey at age 28. She was inspired by a 78 year-old who crossed the finish line during the Boston Marathon in 2013, “I thought, what an accomplishment. I’m 28 and can’t even fathom having to run a 10K, let alone a full marathon.” Oola Sportswear is the brainchild of Haya’s desire to enjoy the great outdoors while staying inline with her values and culture. “My drive is a result of being able to provide Muslim women with a whole new experience in sports and fitness.” After tireless shopping sprees at major sports stores and a whole lot of creativity (and luck), Haya often found herself having to mix and match a lot of pieces from various stores to make an outfit work.Haya hopes that Oola Sportwear will make room for women in the Muslim world to feel comfortable while enjoying outdoor sports as well as lower the barrier to entry for women looking to compete in sports professionally. When Haya is not outdoors working up a sweat, she coaches tech entrepreneurs, mentoring them to launch their own businesses. She holds an MBA from MIT Sloan School of Management. Haya enjoys cycling, hiking, kayaking, and running.AMINA AHMADIDesign & Product Development Director, Co-founderAn architect, design thinker and a self-proclaimed hiking fiend, Amina struggled with finding sportswear that was lightweight, breathable and modest. “Not finding suitable clothing for outdoor sports while remaining within the realm of my values was frustrating and often led to me not participating in a number of outdoor activities.”Intimidated by sports from an early age, Amina’s interest for fitness was sparked later on in life at age 29. It wasn’t until February 2012, when Amina discovered her passion for fitness and health. “I enrolled in a weeklong program included a daily training, mountain hikes, healthy eating and relaxation. Joining outdoor activities and being immersed in nature with views that would take anyone’s breath away, I was hooked. Hiking had now become my addiction.” Amina continued to travel and made sure to incorporate hiking into almost every trip. On January 1st, 2015, Amina became one of many to summit Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, as part of a fundraising campaign for Palestine Children’s Relief Fund. It was during this feat that Amina realized the lack of modest, functional and suitably designed clothing for women in hijab. Being an architect, a creative with a love for design, it was only natural that Amina would develop sportswear that is modest, contemporary and fashionable. “I want Oola to encourage other women to be active, challenge boundaries, enjoy the outdoors without thinking twice about apparel and comfort.” Amina holds an MSc in Advanced Architectural Studies from UCL. She enjoys hiking, cycling and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.LILIAN GABRIEL DE ALMEIDA BARBOSAFashion Designer, Co-founderA Brazilian citizen and passionate fashion designer, Lilian encompasses the perfect match of sports and design.

<p>StitchKit comes with a custom Arduino-based board (based on the ATMega32U4) that is made specifically for FashionTech and wearables. The controller (the brain of a fashion tech/wearable piece) was designed to withstand movements of daily wear and use, yet is compact enough to be incorporated and hidden into your fashion or wearable piece. This is based on our experiences using several types Arduino boards and having them break during runway shows, or when people are wearing fashion tech pieces on a runway. </p>
<p>We also designed this board to be powerful with lights and so far, we've tested 300 lights at full white brightness with no issues, and over 500 for rainbow colors!</p>

<p><strong>Lots of Different Sensors</strong></p>
<p>A number of different sensors, such as sound, proximity (distance), light, vibration, buttons, touch, accelerometers and more, are available depending on which kit you choose. The cool thing, is we are plugging into the Grove sensor system by Seeed Studio, who we've worked closely with to develop StitchKit.

We produced over 100 wearable tech garments and showcased at over 60 international events. We introduce high-end fashion designers and artists to the exciting world of wearables through a series of informative, hands-on, designer-lead workshops. MakeFashion has showcased around the world including New York, Rome, and Shenzhen, so we know a thing or two about wearables and fashion!  Because of MakeFashion, we also started running STEAM workshops, introducing people to technology through fashion. This has had such a profound and transformative impact on the lives of the people we teach, as well as ourselves. StitchKit is inspired by the work we have done in this space, and the amazing people, and teams we have worked with over the last 6 years. Throughout this campaign, we will be sharing stories and creations from those who have motivated and inspired StitchKit.  A Custom StitchKit Arduino Board
StitchKit comes with a custom Arduino-based board (based on the ATMega32U4) that is made specifically for FashionTech and wearables. The controller (the brain of a fashion tech/wearable piece) was designed to withstand movements of daily wear and use, yet is compact enough to be incorporated and hidden into your fashion or wearable piece. This is based on our experiences using several types Arduino boards and having them break during runway shows, or when people are wearing fashion tech pieces on a runway. 
We also designed this board to be powerful with lights and so far, we've tested 300 lights at full white brightness with no issues, and over 500 for rainbow colors!

Lots of Different Sensors
A number of different sensors, such as sound, proximity (distance), light, vibration, buttons, touch, accelerometers and more, are available depending on which kit you choose. The cool thing, is we are plugging into the Grove sensor system by Seeed Studio, who we've worked closely with to develop StitchKit. All Grove sensors will work with the StitchKit board, and we will be creating additional add-on sensor kits in the future!
All of the LED lights! Lights, lights, and more lights! We typically use a few types of LED strips for both our workshops and runways (such as anything related to WS2812b's). So we included a bunch of them in all of the kits, plus a special sewable LED strip (the first of its kind!)Batteries aren't included with StitchKit because of international shipping regulations. However, standard USB power banks work just great with the StitchKit board, lights, and sensors! StitchKit is for anyone and everyone interested in fashion, technology, wearables, or cosplay and wants to create really cool things. Our aim is to reduce the barriers into technology and fashion, letting you be creative.For kids and parents, this is a fun way to learn the basics of electronics and programming, and we think it is super fun! This past Halloween, we did a workshop with kids who created FashionTech Halloween costumes, and the results were amazing!These super cool fidget spinner costumes were created by kids and they were a huge hit in the neighbourhood where they went trick or treating during Halloween this past year. This is a great beginner kit to engage students in fun projects! Something we find really exciting about StitchKit is that it enables technology to be used in classrooms outside of Computer Science. Over the next year, we will be working with teachers locally in Canada and internationally to create a curriculum that educators can use around FashionTech. We believe this is the best way to teach STEAM for girls. If you’d like to get involved, shoot us an email at hello@wearlabs.ca!For designers, this kit includes much of what you need to start in FashionTech! Not only have we tested the board, lights and sample code, but we’ve been using them in our runways and workshops around the world already. It works great for us and we know it will for you as well!At MakerFaire Xi'an 2017, we spent over one month working with several first-time local designers and StitchKit to create wonderful FashionTech pieces for a runway show!Some of our team and ambassadors are costumer designers, and cosplayers; check out how well this kit can be used to create cool costumes, props and other interesting things. These tech couture costumes were created by Angela Dale, a talented designer, costume creator, and all around awesome maker. She creates pieces for TV, Film, among other industries. Check out some of her work here. The main team behind StitchKit consists of:
Shannon Hoover
Teddy Seyed
Ryan Bailey
Maria Elena Hoover
But we are also a large group of talented engineers, designers, cosplayers, videographers, musicians, and educators. We hope you enjoy our campaign and look forward to you joining our StitchKit family and helping to create amazing wearables and FashionTech pieces!For StitchKit, we've partnered with:

Seeed Studios: an open source hardware products and manufacturing company that enables hardware making. They are headquartered in Shenzhen with operations in San Francisco and Taiwan.

MakeFashion: a Fashion Tech startup located in Calgary, Canada, that has been doing FashionTech runway shows around the world for the past six years. 
Risks and challengesWe understand the complexities of creating FashionTech products. In order to reduce the frustration of our backers, we have been working in China for the last two years to ensure that the project is as close as possible to mass production before we launched our initial Kickstarter project, and we are now closer to shipping than ever with our Indiegogo InDemand campaign. We've also partnered with Seeed Studios to ensure smoother timelines and delivery process.Although a glance at the project timeline will show a massive amount of work already done to ensure that StitchKit is as close to production ready as possible, there are still some standard risks and factors left to overcome. In our current stage, this primarily includes logistics, and import customs. We’ve been preparing to take on these and any other unforeseen circumstances that Murphy and his law have waiting.In order to minimize risk, the production run will be limited to 60% of our factory's maximum capacity. Shipping will be performed on a daily to weekly basis following the “pizza delivery approach” where products get shipped as soon as they are ready, rather than waiting for bulk shipment. We have ordered enough components to ensure that we can successfully meet the demand of our original Kickstarter backers and our Indiegogo backers.",20.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h2>Waterproof/windproof/water repellent</h2>
<h3>3 layer construction</h3>
<p>Our mission is to keep you comfortable and stylish; warm when it's cold, cool when it's hot and completely dry when it's raining. That's why we used a 3 layer construction for The Elon coat (similar to extreme sports gear) . The first layer is water repellent and scratch-resistant, the second layer is waterproof and thermoregulating and the third layer provides warmth and comfort.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540221228/yx3jfqyjtzbe9bowolul.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Schoeller Nanosphere®</strong></h3>
<p>The Elon coat is made with the most advanced fabrics that utilize  <a href=""https://www.schoeller-textiles.com/en/technologies/nanosphere"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color:rgb(33,249,143);"" target=""_blank"">The Schoeller Nanosphere®</a>, this truly amazing textile finishing technology enables this coat to keep you cool, comfortable and weather protected all day, and night, long. The nanoparticles, in the fabric, form a protective barrier that prevents water, oil and dirt from being absorbed through the 3 layer construction.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Taped seams</strong></h3>
</div>
<p>Found on only the best, high-end outdoor gear, taped seams are crucial to guarantee that your garment will be 100% waterproof. Basic or needle stitching can leave holes in fabric allowing water to seep in. Taping is an extra step that seals seams making them airtight.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538731227/xtfqdru0f8dpjnjjcfvn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Stretch fabric - easy to wear</strong></h3>
<div>
<center style=""text-align: left;"">With its 2% elastane fabric the Elon coat is really easy to wear and lets you move as much as you want (fabric composition : 61% polyester, 24% viscose, 13% polyurethane, 2% elastane).</center>
<center> </center>
<center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/iqtgv5fgkCw87byiVc/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></center>
<p> </p>
<h3>Long lasting components</h3>
<p>If all the fabric features above are not enough, the external layer of our coat is also abrasive resistant. It got the same results at the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martindale_(unit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color:rgb(33,249,143);"" target=""_blank"">Martindale abrasive test</a> than the fabric used for public transport. </p>
<p>We also used YKK® zippers. YKK is the world largest zipper manufacturer. Their products are known to last decades.</p>
<p>And those are just examples among others : Coolmax© lining, Dorlet® snaps, Mode Harmony® drawstrings...</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Thermoregulated.  Wear this coat for every season and any reason.</h2>

<p>If you need to ride your bike in the rain, we designed the hood to be helmet friendly and added a visor.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Adaptable neck protection</h2>
<p>The neck is one of the most exposed and cold-sensitive areas of the body. With a classically constructed coat, the neck is not always protected. We addressed this and included adaptable neck protection. For a precise fit : adjust the coverage and protection with the snap system. Useful when you're riding your bike, motorbike, skateboard or walking against the wind.</p>

</div></div>","Adresse Paris presents the Elon coat: THE Ultimate Coat You’ll Wear 365 Days-a-Year

Introducing ADRESSE Paris, a unique, new fashion brand that mixes form with function and sophistication with stylish practicality. Designed for the urban man, our clothes are inspired by and crafted to match multifaceted and busy lifestyles. Our coat is constructed to make life easier - with style;  whether walking around town, commuting to the office, on your bike, in heavy rain or and headed a romantic dinner with someone special. No matter the occasion or the weather, our techwear makes it mark on the urban lifestyle in a very functional and fashionable way.

Emprunté à un grand nom de la Silicon Valley, Elon résonne comme la promesse d’un produit fait pour et par la ville.

Son design sobre et épuré, sa coupe élégante ne laissent à première vue rien présager de ses nombreuses fonctionnalités.


------


Try before you buy
We invite you to discover The Elon coat in person - try it on, experience its beautiful construction and tailored sophistication. See, firsthand, its posh practicality.
From October, 22nd The Elon coat will be available for complimentary personal fittings at our partner store : Sauver le Monde des hommes, 8 Rue Beaurepaire, 75010 Paris at the regular opening hours.
Sizes available at fitting are S-M-L-XL (XS and XXL be available to order, please refer to the size chart for sizing).
After the campaign the coat will also be available in store at his final price : 450€.
 









Waterproof/windproof/water repellent
3 layer construction
Our mission is to keep you comfortable and stylish; warm when it's cold, cool when it's hot and completely dry when it's raining. That's why we used a 3 layer construction for The Elon coat (similar to extreme sports gear) . The first layer is water repellent and scratch-resistant, the second layer is waterproof and thermoregulating and the third layer provides warmth and comfort.


 
Schoeller Nanosphere®
The Elon coat is made with the most advanced fabrics that utilize  The Schoeller Nanosphere®, this truly amazing textile finishing technology enables this coat to keep you cool, comfortable and weather protected all day, and night, long. The nanoparticles, in the fabric, form a protective barrier that prevents water, oil and dirt from being absorbed through the 3 layer construction.



 
 
Taped seams

Found on only the best, high-end outdoor gear, taped seams are crucial to guarantee that your garment will be 100% waterproof. Basic or needle stitching can leave holes in fabric allowing water to seep in. Taping is an extra step that seals seams making them airtight.  


 
Wind shielding ribbed cuffs
Another smart feature that comes from outdoor gear : wind shielding ribbed cuffs. Make sure to stay warm in heavy winds or when riding your bike.

 
Stretch fabric - easy to wear

With its 2% elastane fabric the Elon coat is really easy to wear and lets you move as much as you want (fabric composition : 61% polyester, 24% viscose, 13% polyurethane, 2% elastane).
 

 
Long lasting components
If all the fabric features above are not enough, the external layer of our coat is also abrasive resistant. It got the same results at the Martindale abrasive test than the fabric used for public transport. 
We also used YKK® zippers. YKK is the world largest zipper manufacturer. Their products are known to last decades.
And those are just examples among others : Coolmax© lining, Dorlet® snaps, Mode Harmony® drawstrings...
 
Thermoregulated.  Wear this coat for every season and any reason.
C_change® technology from Schoeller
Inspired by nature, c_change® technology ensures the optimum body climate, no matter the weather. At higher temperatures or during your sprint to catch the subway, the polymer structure of the c_change® membrane, within fabrics, opens so moisture can escape to the outside air. In colder temps, or at times of low activity, the membrane tightens to keep you warm.

 
Coolmax® technology
With its Coolmax® lining, The Elon coat combines quality construction and performance to keep you cool and dry.

 
Removable hood
We made The Elon coat to suit any situation : unexpected rain on the way to happy hour with your friends or a romantic dinner with someone special. Utilize the hood on your way there, then remove it and store in its dedicated inner pocket. The hood will hide away in seconds!

 

If you need to ride your bike in the rain, we designed the hood to be helmet friendly and added a visor.

 
Adaptable neck protection
The neck is one of the most exposed and cold-sensitive areas of the body. With a classically constructed coat, the neck is not always protected. We addressed this and included adaptable neck protection. For a precise fit : adjust the coverage and protection with the snap system. Useful when you're riding your bike, motorbike, skateboard or walking against the wind.

 
10 smart pockets
At ADRESSE Paris we see beauty in practicality. That's why we added 10 smart pockets to the Elon coat. Don't let urban challenges stop you.

 
1 easy access phone pocket + earphones access and buckle
Connect directly to your mobile phone without opening your coat! We also added an earphone cable access clip to keep wires easy to reach and untangled. Live the urban life in music.

 

 
2 zippered key pockets
Keep your keys safe thanks to the internal zippered pockets.

 

2 polar fleece pockets 

Once you've tried those you won't want to live without them. They keep hands warm and dry. They are located in the regular side pockets you can find on a Mackintosh. Right next to those polar fleece pockets, we've added 2 anti-theft pockets (see below).
 
2 anti-theft pockets
Because we know how frustrating it is to lose valuables, we made anti-theft pockets. In the regular side pockets of the coat we added hidden zippered pockets. Keep everything from wallets to gifts to whatever you choose in these pockets.

 
1 credit card pocket
No need to look for your credit card or your transportation pass anymore. Zip these necessities away safely and keep them at easy access.

 
 
 
1 tablet pocket and 1 hood storage pocket
You need to carry essentials during your day. That's why we even made pockets for your tablet or other technology.

 
Bike friendly features
Whether you are riding a motorbike, a bicycle or are running to your next meeting, you need to be able to move easily and freely. The Elon coat is constructed with an opening at the back AND a convenient two-way zipper in the front.

The Cool Collection is made of your favorite Pima cotton, blended with TransDry and XT2 fibers.  TransDRY helps to move moisture across a greater surface area of the body, stopping it from pooling in unwanted places, keeping you cooler and drier at night.XT2 fibers utilize the antimicrobial properties of silver to stop odor by inhibiting the growth of bacteria and fungi that consumes sweat and cause odors.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Meet 7 yr old gymnast Azalea who has a  true passion for gymnastics. In this video she performs her gold medal floor routine at the Planet Fall Festival in Hattiesburg Mississippi. She performed this winning routine with a strained knee and she gave it her all like a true champion. She has been doing this sport of gymnastics for 3 1/2 years. She started when she was 3 and has rapidly advanced with her natural athletic ability ( something I believe she inherited from her uncle Leroy). She has been invited to compete at the Houston Invitational Gymnastics Competion on February 23 in Houston. We are asking for your help to get her there.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Breaking it down,</p>
<p>We need to be able to cover the drive from here to Houston and back which we estimate to be $250.</p>
<p>The hotel that has been discounted for the meet attendees is Hilton Americas next to the Convention center and the discounted rate a night is $147 per night. The advantage to staying there is that it is adjacent to the convention center- the location of the meet and she will be able to be as rested as possible before her competiion that morning where she must check in at 7:30 am.</p>
<p> We have estimated food costs at $300 for the two days, including the drive there and back.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You have the opportunity to help a little girl pursue her passions of being a competitive athlete at such a young age. She will get to see what it is like to compete on a different arena with many highly talented competitors from all over. I believe it is a good opportunity for her to see what is beyond this local gymnastics arena and she can be proud of herself when she is able to benchmark herself against other talented little athletes from all over. She is excited and determined to compete in this competition and the experience would be truly a great character building experience for her. Due to the hight costs incurred each month for Azalea and Alina (Azalea's little sister)  gymnastics tuition and for registration and participation at the local meets, it is not within our budget to facilitate Azalea attending the Houston Invitational. We turn to you to help us make Azalea's goal to compete and shine at the Houston Invitational Gymnastics a dream come true for her and an experience she will always cherish.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not able to help financially at this time, please wish her well on her gymnastics journey and say a prayer for her continued success. Azalea and I thank you for your consideration and hope that we can count on your future support.</p>

<p>I will be going through all the funder emails and emailing everyone tomorrow. This is simply because there are that many that it will take me a full day to get through them all (I cannot say thank you enough!) and today I need to make sure the usual admin and orders are sorted beforehand. I'm very excited to see what you all pick for your first wig and truly am absolutely overwhelmed by the amazing response and kindness of you all &lt;3 Thank you all so much!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have been running Geisha Wigs for just over six months now and feel very lucky that I have a business that means so much to me! However being the only person running the business, this means I am struggling to go to the next level due to lack of finances. This is where you may come in, and I will make sure you all get a lovely reward for your contribution!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Geisha Wigs' main aim is to provide beautiful hair at reasonable prices. Having worn some kind of hair extensions for over 10 years, and wigs for a good couple of years, I have a personal love for wigs. Wearing a wig means I can change my look whenever I feel like it, without damaging my own hair with dyes or extensions. It also gives me a lot of confidence, and from what I have been told by my lovely customers, I am not alone on this. This in itself makes me feel so happy, that I can perhaps help people feel a little more secure and happy in themselves.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have decided to set up this fundraiser, as I have so many ideas and plans for Geisha Wigs, but financially I am unable to achieve these alone, and without increasing the prices I charge customers. As I pride myself on providing beautiful wigs at reasonable prices, I am unwilling to raise the prices and therefore have decided to ask for small donations, in exchange for exclusive items and services.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Should my project get accepted, I will use the money to buy the stock for the new collection, including clothing and accessories aswell as wigs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I cannot thank you all enough for taking the time to read this, whether you contribute or not (as I know that times are very hard right now), the fact that you have shown an interest means such a lot, thank you.</p></div>","INDIEGOGO funder update!

<p>Basketball saved my life.</p>
<p>I grew up poor in New Orleans, a city where 38% of the population lives in poverty and only one in 12 adults holds a college degree. My mother was strong and intelligent, but she had to raise four kids on her own while fighting an autoimmune disease. “No one owes you anything,” she would tell me. “You will have to earn everything yourself.” </p>
<p> I didn’t listen to her. Instead, I lashed out at teachers in school. Soon, if I wasn’t in detention I wasn’t in school at all. I’d begun the negative spiral whose effects I saw all around me; I’d started down the path that in my neighborhood led to drugs, crime, and too often early death. </p>
<p>But I didn’t take that path. Basketball rescued me.</p>

<p>I began playing in community centers. High school coaches recognized my promise and encouraged me. They made me understand the skills I acquired on the basketball court could be transferred to other parts of my life. They made me see that I wouldn't be a truly successful basketball player unless my athletic abilities were matched by academic achievement. And that character counted—both on and off the court. By my senior year I was the fourth-ranked high school basketball player in Louisiana. I went on to play for Northwestern Oklahoma State University and for San Francisco State University, where I earned my B.S. in Recreation Administration/Community Outreach. </p>

<h1>TEAMS</h1>
<h3>Team MicroElements</h3>
<p>MicroElements is a young 2-year-old technology company. We're a small team of friends with a mad set of skills ranging from engineering and programming to design and innovation. </p>
<p>We started working together some years ago on several new concepts with the aim of creating innovative solutions that would make life easier for everyone who used them. We believe in innovation and breakthrough, and that every problem must have a solution.</p>
<h3>Team Goingwin</h3>
<p>Goingwin is an experienced international industrial design organization; it covers every part of industrial design with its professional services.  We specialize in consideration of design, modeling, material, technology and production. And we have a wealth of factory resources including prototyping, modeling, injection molding, metals and assembling. Our vertical integrate services can guarantee the implement of product design, which covers every part from primary design to mass production.</p>
<h1><b>Funding Goal</b></h1>
<div>
<p>So today I'm reaching out through Indiegogo for backing in order to secure enough orders to go through a complete manufacturing cycle. The prototypes we've manufactured have provided proof of concept, and we're satisfied with the vendors that we've selected, but it's not until we've gone through a production run that we will know where product alterations, re-designs or vendor changes will need to take place. </p>
<p>We've already invested a substantial amount of our own money into the design and development process, including tooling, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and environmental testing and are nearly ready to begin production.</p>
<p>Ultimately your support will allow us to continue making game changing products that you probably want, so please support us, we won't let you down.</p>
<br/><p>Your support will allow us to go through this necessary production curve and bring this product to market.  See below for more details on each product.</p>
<h1><b>What's Next?</b></h1>
<p>We’re now getting ready to start full production of the UP but we need your help to accomplish that. With the support from Indiegogo we'll be able to start our first full manufacturing run and we will start shipping them to you by December'</p>
<p> We had to use ultra high density components and figure out ways to integrate everything to optimize the proportion.</p>
<p>Our team has a very strong background for design for manufacturing. We have the parts sourcing, manufacturing flow and testing procedures well defined. If the demand is high, we will be able to scale production and logistics accordingly.</p>
<h1>Schedule </h1>
<p>Assuming we meet our funding goal, the anticipated timeline is as follows:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/926881/files/20141013102832-a7b2aef2e056fd2f84d57413818809c7_large.jpg?1413221312"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>For full disclosure, this is a very aggressive timeline and we really can't have many things go wrong in order to get product out to our backers within this timeframe.  In fact, in order for us to make this schedule a reality, we're going to have to get a good sense that this project will fund by the end of September, late October.  </p>
<p>While we've stated February 2015 as the anticipated ship date for the product backer rewards, we are going to give it our best effort to fulfill rewards by mid December 2014.</p>
<p>I've learned that just because you can make it work on paper, doesn't mean it will work in reality :).  As much as we can control it, order fulfillment will be determined on a first come/first serve basis, so if getting product before Christmas is important to you, back us early and tell your friends!</p>

To make this complicated process less burdensome, professional hair designers invented the detailed spear comb to make even a ham-fisted get that perfect hairdo quickly and easily.  The biggest difference between a hair stylist and a normal person is: Hair stylists begin styling from the hair roots.

One day we decided to do something special for the kids. Something that will bring them joy and, at the same time, will develop a sense of style, creativity and independence.We are creating and producing limited edition t-shirts for little fashionistas -  T-shirts with removable dresses. We've created three different collections.
Bright and cheerful author's prints are made to bring fun and joy while wearing a T-shirt. You can select the handmade dresses you like and change them every time you want! 
Please, let
us know which print (choose by name) and dresses (choose by number) you prefer.



You can find more dresses on different prints on our website.




 
Especially for fashionistas. Handmade dresses are miniature copies of those that
movie stars are wearing. Looks great when worn by mom and daughter as a
family-look outfit. Print is made on the fabric, and then the fabric is sewn to the T-shirt. Looks very stylish.
Please, let
us know which print (choose by name) and dresses (choose by number) you prefer.



You can find more dresses on different prints on our website.
Designed specifically for those who appreciate the beauty for its simplicity. For those who choose pastel colors and enjoy the naturalness. T-shirt, print and handmade dresses are made from natural materials.

Please, let us know which print (choose by name) and dresses (choose by number) you prefer.

soft Velcro on its pages, so while playing with T-shirts, girls will be able to
put dresses in wardrobe and to learn how to maintain cleanliness.

There is a reason we choose polycarbonate as the material for primary version of GOVO Badge Holder. Polycarbonate is a very strong type of plastic. It is 40% stronger than ABS plastic that are widely used on many products . It can endure higher and colder temperature than most of plastics. But it is more expensive than them. We tested the polycarbonate version of the badge holder, the result proved it is very strong and durable. There is one part of video you can see from campaign video showing it holds 20 lbs of weight. The front cover and back piece are made from polycarbonate while the clip, screw and spring are made from steel.</p><div data-id=""18554754""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1507225501/yw27qt6bno1lcvmtc9fd.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>Production Image of Polycarbonate GOVO Badge Holder &amp; Wallet</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513799359/svfzffxmofoukqehjetw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Production Image of Polycarbonate GOVO Badge Holder &amp; Wallet</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518839846/fhmffh3xtqxffmeyaje4.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Production Image of Polycarbonate GOVO Badge Holder &amp; Wallet</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1513799439/ixl7c3dy51jnkg0zhuog.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Packages ready for delivery </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518839945/hpczzclf9vw4mzl0mzyc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518833045/qlho5ysyyccsun1ygbnu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><div data-id=""18565568""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1507225502/hy3po5zutj6fitwev54j.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""17791601""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1507225503/iehdfbwd8htt4s0wyb9h.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""17839934""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1507225503/jicg4a6ovoya5ij3g8v8.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""17557945""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1507225504/bhr7ecswtjx6fn1w0ig8.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""18086948""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1507225504/mata9ruex97lzromdkhy.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""17853371""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1507225505/sd1lfnld8ylpcqtsn1ci.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

There is one thing we always neglect but very important, which is the ID Badge we carry to work. We found so much inconveniences of carrying and using a work ID that none of today’s product have a good solution. From there we set our goal to create a wearable device that brings good experience and can be used not only as badge holder but also a wallet to simplify items we carry.  The construction of GOVO Badge Holder & Wallet came from inspiration of military gears that require durability and light weight at the same time. “Versatile, Durable, Light weight” are three key principles we kept in every steps when we developed this product. 
 
Production Version Pictures of GOVO Badge Holder & Wallet   Please Note: All perk options without the word ""TITANIUM"" are polycarbonate version. When we design GOVO Badge Holder & Wallet, we want it to be super durable for everyday use. There is a reason we choose polycarbonate as the material for primary version of GOVO Badge Holder. Polycarbonate is a very strong type of plastic. It is 40% stronger than ABS plastic that are widely used on many products . It can endure higher and colder temperature than most of plastics. But it is more expensive than them. We tested the polycarbonate version of the badge holder, the result proved it is very strong and durable. There is one part of video you can see from campaign video showing it holds 20 lbs of weight. The front cover and back piece are made from polycarbonate while the clip, screw and spring are made from steel. Production Image of Polycarbonate GOVO Badge Holder & WalletProduction Image of Polycarbonate GOVO Badge Holder & WalletProduction Image of Polycarbonate GOVO Badge Holder & WalletPackages ready for delivery

We design all of our products in 10 skin tone hues in order to provide all women with a true nude option. No more settling for beige and tan- we believe that all women deserve to have the option to find their perfect nude. We've created an array of shades designed to suit the darkest of complexions all the way through to the fairest.   In addition to that little black dress and the perfect red lipstick, we believe a good skin tone shoe is a wardrobe essential. They elongate the legs and go with every outfit! Unfortunately, for most women the only options available to them are various shades of beige and tan. In 2016 our founder was forced to buy a pair of white pumps and paint them to match her skin in order to have her own nude shoe. Never again. Since our first successful Indiegogo campaign in 2017 we've made it our goal to create nude shoes that work for women of all complexions. With 10 shades on offer, we're proud to say we have a 100% match rate to date.    We spent countless hours researching skin tones in order to ensure that whether you are fair with pink undertones or more of a mid-tone with hints of olive we have a shade for you. All of you deep dark ladies fear not- we've got something for you as well!In a world that's becoming increasingly diverse, we understand how important it is that we all feel represented.We're redefining the word nude one shoe at a time to give you the color match you deserve. Never again will you have to say ""they don't have my shade."" The release of our debut collection sent shockwaves into the fashion industry. Since we started we've been fortunate enough to be featured in over 75+ print and online publications. More importantly, we've helped inspire hundreds of women across the globe to be proud of the skin they're in.  We design for go-getter and women who believe the world is a better place when we support each other.  We're proud to be on the feet of business executives and students alike. Our Kahmunity members recognize that they  can admire the beauty of otherswithout questioning their own. Whether shown off at work or at a party, here's what members of our Kahmunity have to say about their nudes. Celebrities such as Tamera Mowry  and Lupita Nyong'o are huge fans of comfortable our shoes are and how well they match their skin tones. Our shoes are:  With your help we plan on introducing two new finishes and one new style to our collection: suede, patent, and our new scrappy sandal.

My name is Chris Wilson. I am a high school junior and the sole

	Right

	shooting for $1000 to give my business a good kick in the pants to
	get it off the ground.</p>

Perks!
I know ya love 'em. Check out the Perks section to see what certain
donations could get you!</p>

I
get that not everyone has money lying around begging to be given to
teenagers. So here's why I'm asking for this amount of money:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
	Supplies:
	To make some of my units (magnets, buttons, etc.) I need to print
	things out of my home. This requires ink money. And those of you
	with a printer can vouch for this when I say that ink isn't exactly
	getting cheaper nowadays... The magnet and button units require
	metal pieces and magnets as well. Also, for t-shirts, I do need to
	purchase printing transfers and the shirts themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Mailing:
	I plan to work part of my business through mailing units. Though
	mailing in itself doesn't cost a fortune, the price of it can add up
	over time and it'd be great just to have a set fund that I can go in
	to in order to get the units out to people outside of my area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Insurance:
	Over the course of the last few months, my family and I have put out
	about $1000 towards this project. I'd like to make sure that there's
	a bit of funds put away in case anything were to break or go wrong.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
As
I may have mentioned earlier in this message, I am a junior in high
school. And though I do attend a public school at the moment, it
seems that things have gotten more and more expensive. SAT prep
classes are like, $700 for a few weeks these days. This is not okay.
Not okay at all. I've hoped that through my business I would be able
to not only spread my art around and make people happy; but also
further my education. If all goes well, I may even get to help my
little brother out with school too!</p>
<p>Starting a business is a big step for someone my age and it sure isn't easy. But it's all about
sticking with it and doing all that I can to keep this baby afloat and I really hope you guys will be able to help me do that.</p>

Other
Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>
I
know some of you guys really can't contribute monetarily. And
that's <i>fine. </i>It doesn't mean you can't help out a
little girl with a plan! I'd be super duper grateful if you could
even just give this business a few shares on your social media. Tell

<p><strong>Who is Nathaniel?</strong></p>
<p>Nathaniel Pocock loves snowboarding and has chosen snowboard cross as his discipline. Growing up on the slopes of Owl’s Head in Quebec’s Eastern Townships, Nathaniel now lives in Montreal to begin studying at Concordia University this fall.</p>
<p>Nathaniel’s three sisters, Lara, Aimée and Camille have all been involved in competitive alpine skiing but he chose a different path in an area where snowboard cross was not an option as a sport.</p>
<p>Autumn 2010, Nathaniel moved to Canmore, Alberta, to train full time with a coach and riders based at Lake Louise. That season he began competing on the North American circuit and in the spring of 2012 was named the outstanding Quebec snowboard cross athlete. He is now recognized as one of the best snowboard cross competitors in Quebec and Canada. His dream is to join the National Team and compete internationally.</p>
<p><strong>Your donations?</strong></p>
<p>Nathaniel trains year round even as he works full time outside of the snowboarding season. Despite his earnings, financial help from Snowboard Quebec and sponsors such as Fred Korman at Owl’s Head, Nathaniel has difficulty covering all of his expenses. Your donations would help pay for coaching, year round training, expenses related to travel on the competition circuit and more. A donation of even 10$-20$ would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3>My name is Mitchell Sebastian, I want to thank you for taking a look at my campaign. I am 16 years old and have been riding a snowmobile since I was 2. My dad took me to my first event at age 8 where I got to race with other kids my age. I knew then that I wanted to be a professional snowmobile racer. When I turned 12 my dad and I started traveling to races so I could get more experience. In 2009 I won a very big race at the junior level. In 2010, we did it again. If you Google my name along with ""starting them young"" you will find an article written about me from the folks at Vintagesleds. Since then we have stepped up to the ""grown-up"" classes with much success. I am proud to be a 2-time winner of the Tracy Kruger Memorial Speedrun. Last year I finished my season with 27 podium finishes and 13 class wins. This is my calling, my dream if you will to become a professional factory driver. I know I can do it, I just need some help. This is where I need you, to help me reach that next level. Here is the next level : Cross Country racing. I have already purchased a new 22 foot trailer to work out of and a used 2009 snowmobile to convert into the racer I need it to be. If you have a heart for, or a passion for racing, you will understand this well. You need alot of parts and services to add to the sled to make it perform. What I am asking from you, If you feel my passion or even a passion within yourself...please consider helping me. Your contribution to my race...it counts ! It matters!</h3>

<h3>What I need from you and what I want to do for you: I need dollars to purchase upgrades for this snowmobile: New skis, New shock packages, tracks, studs, clutches, suspensions etc. This entry into Cross Country racing is going to be a new discipline for me and to win, I must be prepared. What I want to do for you : From the 1st person to the last. I will personally mail you a 'Mitchell Sebastian Team 65' decal for your car or truck, so everyone knows you are helping. At the end of the season, I will mail you a photo of my sled in action. And to the larger helpers, since space is limited on the snowmobile. I will get these folks on the sled as well as on the trailer. We usually do t-shirts too. You will look awesome in a 'Team 65 Racing' shirt!! I am seeking 10,000.00 to help with the parts and services to make my race sled top notch. I've bought the sled. I've bought the trailer. I need YOU to help me go faster and win some races!! In 4 years, I've only gotten better! Lets race to the top together. Thank you and God bless you for looking! One last thing... If I don't make my goal, the funds I do raise will be used as effectively as possible to race ahead. Tell your friends, ask them to get on board too ! We can do this ! Mitchell</h3>
