<p>IV is the exciting combination of Jesse Quattro, Seán van Doornum, Devin Hoff and Shahzad Ismaily.

<p>Hi folks, thanks for checking out my indiegogo campaign! I'm Elder Sister Plum, otherwise known as Tanya Semple, and I'm a folk singer/musician living in Toronto, ON. I've been writing and performing music as Elder Sister Plum since my teenage years on Vancouver Island, B.C. I've sung my stories and performed my swashbuckling folk lullabies all over Canada and I finally have the opportunity to record these tunes on my first professionally recorded album, 'People Like Us'.</p>
<p>This album means the world to me! Many of the songs you'll hear I've been playing for years, and have only imagined how they would sound being played by a full band. Now, with full creative control and Kaleb Hikele, an unbelievably helpful and supportive Engineer/Musician by my side, I finally get to hear what I've only been able to imagine up until now. </p>
<p>This album is an extremely honest look into my personal journey over the years. There are songs from nearly every stage of my life as a songwriter, from the age of 17 until now, at 25. I have been continuosly writing through the good and the bad times, the amazing adventures and the unfortunate missteps. And of course there will be a healthy dose of pirates dancing the hempen jig, and sirens singing ships into the rocks. </p>

<p>Why do we need your support?</p>After the early 2000s, rap sales started to slowly decline.  However, it wasn’t until 2005 when the decline became more rapid.  It is now worse than it has ever been, with rap turning into a battle of who gets more “hos” and more money.  Rap got boring very quickly in the late 2000s.  After the innovative rap music coming right after the new millennium, hip-hop started to die.  Rappers started talking about what makes them look more manly in the hood, instead of telling stories people love to hear.  Although the economy has suffered and overall music sales have declined, rap has taken the hardest hit.  White teenage kids, raps biggest investor, have quit spending their money on a boring and typical product.  Why? Because it has turned into crap. Who wants to listen to music that talks about drugs, money, diamonds, cars, and clubs all the time?  I sure don’t.  I agree with music consultant Tom Vickers, who says in a TIME Magazine article, “Rap has to look at the bigger issues confronting society. There's only so much “bling” the public can take.” Yes there are a few anomalies, maybe one song on a CD is really good, but the rest aren’t worth buying.  No wonder album sales are down.  Record companies waste so much time and effort producing a hit single, that the rest of the album is trash, so we only buy the one hit single. <p></p>
<p>The solution here is simple.  Reform hip-hop.  Many people love rap music and they’d hate to see it diminish.  The reform of hip-hop must be soon, swift, and big if executives want the industry to bounce back.  There are enough people out there who want rap to succeed and would pay to see it get better.  Honestly, how hard could it really be?  Writing more creative songs and using less profanity shouldn’t be a challenge for rappers like Jay-Z, T.I., Kanye West, and Lil’ Wayne.  These rappers can create a rhyme out of anything, so why must it be the same thing over and over again.  Try something new and see if people buy it. - <b><i>By Sam Rakoczy</i></b></p>

Why do we need your support?After the early 2000s, rap sales started to slowly decline.  However, it wasn’t until 2005 when the decline became more rapid.  It is now worse than it has ever been, with rap turning into a battle of who gets more “hos” and more money.  Rap got boring very quickly in the late 2000s.  After the innovative rap music coming right after the new millennium, hip-hop started to die.  Rappers started talking about what makes them look more manly in the hood, instead of telling stories people love to hear.  Although the economy has suffered and overall music sales have declined, rap has taken the hardest hit.  White teenage kids, raps biggest investor, have quit spending their money on a boring and typical product.  Why? Because it has turned into crap. Who wants to listen to music that talks about drugs, money, diamonds, cars, and clubs all the time?  I sure don’t.  I agree with music consultant Tom Vickers, who says in a TIME Magazine article, “Rap has to look at the bigger issues confronting society. There's only so much “bling” the public can take.” Yes there are a few anomalies, maybe one song on a CD is really good, but the rest aren’t worth buying.  No wonder album sales are down.  Record companies waste so much time and effort producing a hit single, that the rest of the album is trash, so we only buy the one hit single. 
The solution here is simple.  Reform hip-hop.  Many people love rap music and they’d hate to see it diminish.  The reform of hip-hop must be soon, swift, and big if executives want the industry to bounce back.  There are enough people out there who want rap to succeed and would pay to see it get better.  Honestly, how hard could it really be?  Writing more creative songs and using less profanity shouldn’t be a challenge for rappers like Jay-Z, T.I., Kanye West, and Lil’ Wayne.  These rappers can create a rhyme out of anything, so why must it be the same thing over and over again.  Try something new and see if people buy it. - By Sam Rakoczy

<p>My name is Donnacha Costello.

<p>In 2010 my life changed quite dramatically. I took a step back from music, quickly sold my entire studio and focused on other things.</p><p></p>
<p>I always knew I would come back to music and in the past year I have been working with a little synthesiser, <a href=""http://www.teenageengineering.com/products/op-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""blank"">OP-1</a>, and posting sketches made with this to my<a href=""http://soundcloud.com/donnachacostello"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""blank""> Soundcloud page</a>.</p><p>As my life continues to change, I finally feel ready to build up a new studio and to make a new album of ambient, emotional, experimental music - <b>Love From Dust</b>. </p><p><br/></p><p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/donnacha-costello-love-from-dust-album-project/contributions/new?perk_amt=25&amp;perk_id=2036597"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 40px; background-color: initial;"">BUY LOVE FROM DUST NOW &gt;</a><br/></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Serendipity</span> </p><p>I've been on a waiting list for an EMS Synthi A since 2001, when I first found out that Robin Wood had plans to hand-build a small batch in Cornwall, England. Even as production continued to be delayed, I waited patiently for my Synthi for many years. Eventually, I gave up hope of ever owning this instrument.<br/></p><p>Then, something amazing happened. I was contacted by EMS to say that my Synthi was <b>about to be built and would be ready this summer</b>. Unbelievably, the 13 year wait was over. The timing could not have been more perfect as I had just started production on <b>Love From Dust.</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><h3>Crowdfunding</h3><p>Selling Love From Dust via a crowdfunding campaign will allow me to generate the funds needed to record/manufacture the album as I want to make it:</p><p></p><ol>
<li>€2000 - Recording/Mastering/Design/Manufacture</li>
<li>€720 - The cost in fees to Indiegogo and Paypal to run the campaign</li>
<li>€6200 - EMS Sythi (Or €4000 for Buchla Music Easel)</li>
<li>€700 - I/O device for recording</li>
</ol><p>The approximate cost of making the album I want to make is <b>€9600</b></p><p>Selling Love From Dust the old-fashioned way, it could take more than a year to recoup these costs. By that time, the opportunity to purchase the Synthi would also have passed me by.</p><p>I'm aiming for 66% funding, with the remainder coming from my pocket, which is why I've set the target at €6000. Indiegogo offers flexible funding, which means that if the target isn't reached, the campaign is still funded. I will continue to make the album and manufacture the physical release with the resources at my disposal should I fail to reach my ideal funding target.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Offering</h3>
<p>I have started work on <b>Love From Dust </b>and will finish it by the end of 2014. It's ambient music, with a modern aesthetic and uses new ideas and techniques I've developed since the last time I made an ambient album in 2001.</p><p>As with all of the music I've released, it offers up a <i>slice of life</i> view of how I'm feeling, my perspective on current aesthetics in electronic music and reflections of the tools I'm choosing.</p><p>You can expect to find shades of the emotional approach of my <b>Together Is The New Alone</b> album <b>(Mille Plateaux, 2001) </b>and some of the modular synthesiser experimentalism of my  <b>Modul.Isol</b> album <b>(Raster-Noton, 2004).</b></p><p>Don't expect it to ""sound like"" these albums, I've always tried not to re-tread old ground :)</p><p>At the moment, this campaign allows you to buy:</p><p></p><p></p><ul>

Thanks to all who have contributed so far! - Donnacha.New ambient mix containing work from 1998-2011 uploaded to soundcloud. Several unreleased works:LISTEN NOW
New REMIX perk added. ONLY 3 AVAILABLE!CHECK IT OUTLOVE FROM DUSTThe Basics
My name is Donnacha Costello. I've been making music for as long as I can remember and have been releasing it commercially since 1996:http://www.discogs.com/artist/5735-Donnacha-Costello
In 2010 my life changed quite dramatically. I took a step back from music, quickly sold my entire studio and focused on other things.
I always knew I would come back to music and in the past year I have been working with a little synthesiser, OP-1, and posting sketches made with this to my Soundcloud page.As my life continues to change, I finally feel ready to build up a new studio and to make a new album of ambient, emotional, experimental music - Love From Dust. BUY LOVE FROM DUST NOW >Serendipity I've been on a waiting list for an EMS Synthi A since 2001, when I first found out that Robin Wood had plans to hand-build a small batch in Cornwall, England. Even as production continued to be delayed, I waited patiently for my Synthi for many years. Eventually, I gave up hope of ever owning this instrument.Then, something amazing happened. I was contacted by EMS to say that my Synthi was about to be built and would be ready this summer. Unbelievably, the 13 year wait was over. The timing could not have been more perfect as I had just started production on Love From Dust.CrowdfundingSelling Love From Dust via a crowdfunding campaign will allow me to generate the funds needed to record/manufacture the album as I want to make it:
€2000 - Recording/Mastering/Design/Manufacture
€720 - The cost in fees to Indiegogo and Paypal to run the campaign
€6200 - EMS Sythi (Or €4000 for Buchla Music Easel)
€700 - I/O device for recording
The approximate cost of making the album I want to make is €9600Selling Love From Dust the old-fashioned way, it could take more than a year to recoup these costs. By that time, the opportunity to purchase the Synthi would also have passed me by.I'm aiming for 66% funding, with the remainder coming from my pocket, which is why I've set the target at €6000. Indiegogo offers flexible funding, which means that if the target isn't reached, the campaign is still funded. I will continue to make the album and manufacture the physical release with the resources at my disposal should I fail to reach my ideal funding target.Offering
I have started work on Love From Dust and will finish it by the end of 2014. It's ambient music, with a modern aesthetic and uses new ideas and techniques I've developed since the last time I made an ambient album in 2001.As with all of the music I've released, it offers up a slice of life view of how I'm feeling, my perspective on current aesthetics in electronic music and reflections of the tools I'm choosing.You can expect to find shades of the emotional approach of my Together Is The New Alone album (Mille Plateaux, 2001) and some of the modular synthesiser experimentalism of my  Modul.Isol album (Raster-Noton, 2004).Don't expect it to ""sound like"" these albums, I've always tried not to re-tread old ground :)At the moment, this campaign allows you to buy:

Love From Dust as a download or CD with download.
A track by track subscription as Love From Dust is being made
All of the above plus a thank you and acknowledgment as a financier on the CD

<p>WHO IS GALI?</p>
<p>Gali is know as one of Hampi's most remarkable figures. He is the music man of this wonderfull city, famous for recieving tourists and travellers with incomparable good vibrations, into jam sessions, soundhealing sessions or a nice cup of chai. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He is know for making people play music, even if they are not musicians. He invites them into their shop. He shows him his guitars, drums and flutes. He makes people get to know each other through music, community healing and individual expression. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Is there anything better to do??</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHAT IS WRONG? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, not all is easy in Gali's life. Besides having to pay the rent pf his shop, supporting his family (Gali is father of two kids, passionate for music and talented ones), he now faces the threats of demolition. </p>
<p>Indian govenerment is about to pass a bill that will tear down many of Hampi's local dreams. Shops will be demolished and they will run out of business... so... no more music shop, no more music, no more projects for Gali.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE PLAN </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a near future, NEW HAMPI will be born, on the other side of the river where Gali's shop is. This will be the new touristic center of Happy Hampi, where most shops, hostels and restaurants will be. Gali's good vibe's will have to be there but, in order for that to happen. he needs to buy land. </p>
<p>20.000 USD is what he needs to build is new place: NEW HAMPI MUSIC HEAVEN, where people will be able to continue jamming and meeting, getting to know the best of Hampi, wich is the warmth of it's people. </p>
<p>This place will host concerts and artistic residencies, inviting professional and amateur musicians from all over the world.</p>

<p>If you help Gali, with whatever amount, you will have the right to stay in NEW HAMPI MUSIC HEAVEN for 3 nights. Not a bad way to stay in Hampi, hum?</p>
</div></div>","WHO IS GALI?
Gali is know as one of Hampi's most remarkable figures. He is the music man of this wonderfull city, famous for recieving tourists and travellers with incomparable good vibrations, into jam sessions, soundhealing sessions or a nice cup of chai. 
 
He is know for making people play music, even if they are not musicians. He invites them into their shop. He shows him his guitars, drums and flutes. He makes people get to know each other through music, community healing and individual expression. 
 
Is there anything better to do??
 
WHAT IS WRONG? 
 
However, not all is easy in Gali's life. Besides having to pay the rent pf his shop, supporting his family (Gali is father of two kids, passionate for music and talented ones), he now faces the threats of demolition. 
Indian govenerment is about to pass a bill that will tear down many of Hampi's local dreams. Shops will be demolished and they will run out of business... so... no more music shop, no more music, no more projects for Gali.
 
THE PLAN 
 
In a near future, NEW HAMPI will be born, on the other side of the river where Gali's shop is. This will be the new touristic center of Happy Hampi, where most shops, hostels and restaurants will be. Gali's good vibe's will have to be there but, in order for that to happen. he needs to buy land. 
20.000 USD is what he needs to build is new place: NEW HAMPI MUSIC HEAVEN, where people will be able to continue jamming and meeting, getting to know the best of Hampi, wich is the warmth of it's people. 
This place will host concerts and artistic residencies, inviting professional and amateur musicians from all over the world.
 
 
YOUR REWARD
If you help Gali, with whatever amount, you will have the right to stay in NEW HAMPI MUSIC HEAVEN for 3 nights. Not a bad way to stay in Hampi, hum?",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello! My name is Phillip Ramirez, I was born in Newport Beach california. I come from a very musical family and learned at a young age the love and joy that comes from music. As a very young person, I was always creating and developing different musical groups both instrumental and vocal, which lead me into my professional music career that started back in 1988 after appearing at the ""World famous Apollo Theatre"" 3 consecutive times. I was then approached by the Washington D.C. production team 95 North. Our first dance club single release ""See the Light"" was a hit and catapulted my career overnight! Since then, I have been fortunate enough to travel the world performing as a Dance club recording artist with over 30 dance singles to date. I have since evolved into a professional acting career and have most recently produced, co-wrote and am the Principle lead in a musical play ""Dance Disco Heat"" a tribute to the Disco Icon ""Sylvester."" His music touched the world with such hits as ""You make me feel Mighty real"" and ""Do you wanna funk."" I have always been a huge fan of Sylvester, not only with his music but his pioneer mentality in paving the road and not allowing others to dictate how he lived his life. His music had such an impact on my own musical career that I felt compelled to tell his story and remind those young and old that love surpasses all predjudice. ""Dance Disco Heat""  is a beautiful, glitzy, musical journey that takes you from his humble beginnings, to fame, meeting the love of his life and the AIDS epidemic all done in a grand musical story. From beginning to end, you will feel Sylvester's presence through the emulation and authentic renditions performed in the same fashion that Sylvester and his two tons of fun (backup duo) did back in the 70's, all done Via the mirrored character Octavius (Phillip Ramirez) and the Mega Girls!

<h3>In 2004, Daniel first established a small business he affectionately called Mystic Productions.  This was created in order to provide an avenue to distribute music and art, initially his own, but his vision was to build a vehicle to bring beautiful and inspiring works of many other artists, across all genres, out into the world.  In its prior incarnation the company never found its wings and for the past few years has been in an inactive state, but today we believe the time has come to get Mystic Productions off the ground beginning right here with this grassroots campaign...and it can be done with your help!  Once we can get the company going, all monies taken in will be recycled into funding more art projects.  This is intended as a not for profit endeavor.  Instead of a company getting rich off the works of artists, collecting all the money and giving a criminally small percentage in return, we will be doing just the opposite.  We will be providing for artists while facilitating the creation and distribution of their art.  Our company is and will be an ever-growing cooperative network of artists.  The artists maintain rights and collect the appropriate benefits from their works.  The percentage they elect to give or donate back to the company will be entirely up to them and will then help provide the opportunity for the next art/artist...and so on.  There is always more art to create and bring out into the world to share together.  If we choose to allow for any additional use of funds we have certainly considered what we might be able to do if they were dedicated toward programs fostering the arts in communities worldwide and/or toward other charities, causes, organizations, etc. working to make the world a better place.  Presently we are focused upon the creation part and yet aspire toward the fullest of possibilities in this company's potential.  ""The goal is in spreading this creative vision and passion across the globe for participating in the shaping of our world, in the evolution of human consciousness and in how we are creating our shared reality through cooperation, learning, growing and nurturing greater awareness, and all done in the spirit of this embracing engagement together with the way of the Mystic Artist alive in all of us.""  Kincaid's inspired journey has been that of what one might call a modern mystic; deeply spiritual, of passionate dreams, traversing the outskirts of consciousness and possibility, yet complete with false starts, falls from grace, dark nights of soul and rises from the ashes in truly dazzling fashion.  Today, as he approaches the ever iconic 33rd year of life, he has come to what may finally be the moment of his emergence as an Artist and Visionary.  Daniel is a true force, a powerful spirit and a being of great heart...and his music embodies this as undeniably as he does.  </h3>

<h4>""Creating a cd is an expensive endeavor...let alone creating two!  The good news is that this is what we have to move forward with at the onset here - two full-length albums along with a fairly extensive back catalogue of music that I am bringing with me.  The pictures you see above are examples of this type of collaborative artistic work within the greater vision.  The paintings were inspired by the music, and the artistic relationship that formed between myself and the painter is one to carry into future productions.  Though the ultimate goal remains always in the multi-genre cross-collaborative artist production company, I am first a poet, songwriter, composer and musician.  So, you may not be surprised to find that this platform begins with a musical production.  As this company and its vision does originate with me, these outward movements with my artwork initially does simultaneously, and quite conveniently I'll admit, provide greater potential for the success of the business as a whole.  Moving forward, the greater the ability to gain a presence with my own work will only serve to help generate funding and opportunity for Mystic Productions.  As for this flagship/prototype process, so far I have been able to cover the initial expenses in tracking, mixing and mastering the audio, which is in fact the brunt of it.  However, now with the music ready to make its way out into the world, we (my small team of amazing people and I) are finding ourselves tapped out, completely spread thin...essentially...broke.  In order to help finance what we are doing presently which includes but is not limited to; the registering of domain names, hosting, licensing, disc manufacturing, materials, distribution, promotion, publishing, registration for royalties, etc. -  I/we need your help!!!  We need help with the duplication/replication expenses and the cost of materials for the first runs.  In the future we can eventually acquire our own printing press, but that is likely some time away yet.  We also need help in order to finance the online and physical distribution.  A BIG element is that we need to provide for promotion, marketing, and the costs for an outward presence, not only in the physical world, but also, perhaps primarily at the moment, the web presence.  It would also be great to be able to print up posters, t-shirts and other such elements/merchandise to accompany these musical/artistic works and their progress outward.""</h4>

<p>Beginning in December 2013 we will start the recording process and we are so excited! But we can't make it happen without some financial help from all of you. Even the smallest amount will go far in helping us make our vision for this album a reality!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The minimum we need to fund this project is $4,000. That covers the cost of studio time, production, mixing, and studio musicians. But our goal is to even exceed that in order to cover the cost of CD duplication, digital distribution ( iTunes, Spotify, etc.), and tshirts! We can use any amount you can give!</p>
<p>For your contribution we have some pretty neat perks all the way from a digital download of our new album and a one of a kind tshirt to a full concert at the location of your choice! (Check out all of our giving incentives below.)</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, every penny we earn will go towards the recording cost of this album. No amount is too small!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This full length album will contain 7 original songs by us that we think (and hope) you're going to love. We believe in the value of making great music that people actually want to listen to and that's just what we hope to do with these songs. We are building a project from the ground up that we can't wait for you to hear and be a special part of, whether that's by giving financially or just spreading the word so others can help.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We're college-age adults and we get it: not everyone can afford to give. That doesn't mean you can't still help!</p>

</div></div>","Kem Secksdiin - All This Pain Kem Secksdiin was a member of the live Celldweller crew in 2005-2006 and has also toured as a member of Crossbreed. Additionally, Kem released a single as Subculture on FiXT in 2007, with a FiXT Remix compilation following in 2008.
Kem utilizes an insightful interpretation of underground club music with his metal upbringing to showcase the raw essence and power.
Now after long silence Kem become member of Venator Music and ready to bring his brand new single to the world!
As many of you knows the last full-length album by Kem was pretty awesome but sounds it really bad. So ALL collected money will be spent not only for recording in fully equiped studio with professional sound engineer Matt  Dalton (who also worked with such band as (HED)pe ), but also for mixing and mastering it with all world standarts of quality. Also we planning a huge PR compain with FiXT Publicity and a bunch of merchandise (and of course all contributors get all this stuff for free).
Now we want to let each fan of Kem to support him and Venator Music in this campaign.

P.S.

 Every person will be updated about recording process The best contributors get special prizes from Kem and Venator Music",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>      This group of eclectic 20 somethings began their journey together at Belmont University in the Spring of 2015. Even though they are new as unit, they are certainly not new to the stage or the music industry. All of the members have been performing live for most of their lives and it was only a matter of time before these aspiring musicians crossed paths. What better place than <b>Music City, USA</b>?</div>
<div>    Before they got together though, the kids had played with many different bands. Many of the members struggled for a long time to find people they could click with --  at the end of the day, that is more important than anything else in an artist's eyes. You can have a fantastic group of musicians that are technically skilled and know every note in the book, but if a group doesn't vibe well or have a good amount of chemistry, then what's the point? Sure, you can make money, but when it comes to the creative mindset you need people you can relate to. You need people who can ride on your wavelength and also have fun with. And that's what happened when Trapped On Earth came together. </div>
<div>They found that undeniable chemistry and energy that only great music groups have. Bands like Chicago, Electric Light Orchestra, Blood Sweat &amp; Tears, and so on. When people come to a Trapped On Earth show, it's more than just a bunch of kids playing MoTown -- it's an experience. The presence they omit to their audience is chart topping and people leave feeling all of the emotions the band projected on them with their music. Trapped On Earth wants to leave their mark on society. They want to put an older sound into a millennial spotlight. They want to put the fun back into funk and the move back into groove. </div>

They want to give something to everyone; they want the dancers to jive, the poets to ponder, and the musicians to appreciate. They want to bring old sounds into their new music and ideas to create a completely new wave of music. They want to bring horn driven music back into the forefront and into the view of the general public again.

<p>We all know that college is not cheap. These young students thank their parents over and over again that they even considered letting them pursue their crazy dreams of going to such a highly acclaimed music school. Belmont is one of the top private schools for music and music business and the bill is right at the top there with the ranking. So many of the kids have student loans, and jobs while going to school full time just to keep the interest down. Not to mention that they have other daily expenses like rent, gas, utilities, etc. So its hard to figure in anything else-especially a project like this. With your help though, these kids will have the kickstart they need to pursue their dreams. </p>
<p>Now it might be a little difficult along the way. If the project gets funded, there is a whole new set of obstacles - teamwork will need to be a <b>HUGE </b>part of the project. Even though the group is on the same wavelength most of the time, it's hard getting eight people together and to agree on the same ideas. There will be creative disagreements about certain aspects of the album and there will be times when they will have to work out their differences, but in the end they will always solve their conflicts because they want Trapped on Earth to work. Every member has the same end goal and they will settle any dispute for the music and for the friendship they've gained with the ensemble. </p>

<p>If you don't have any spare cash to give away, that's okay! You can help by just spreading the word around about the group and all the goals they hope to achieve with their project!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Perennial Millennial is, in essence, an experimental folk and concept album about the plight of the Millennial generation. An oft derided age group, dog piled upon, thanks to the age of technology where every baby boomer with a keyboard can write a scathing attack about how Millennials killed the auto industry, McDonalds, their dog, etc. etc. We also come from an age where we remember when phones were connected to the wall, and we had to wait for our favorite show to come on. Nurtured in an older time, but growing up in a rapidly advancing world; the old versus the new. </p>
<p>I've had the idea for a while of writing something like this, and in an extremely prolific couple of months for me, I churned out some of my most personal, political, and dense tracks. These tracks all connect and run through the theme of feeling disenfranchised and lost in a culture that does not reflect how the younger generation feels. </p>
<p>The songs cover many topics</p>
<ul>
<li>Social justice and reform</li>
<li>Old media versus new media</li>
<li>Feelings of inadequacy in different contexts</li>
<li>Love and heartbreak</li>
<li>Being a millennial</li>
</ul>
<p>The album takes place on a city sidewalk, and documents a young man coming into his own. I hope when you listen to the final product, you enjoy it, despair with it,  and find yourself reflected in the music. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All funds for this campaign go to production, mixing, and mastering as well as promotional material; for this we need roughly $3000. <br/>If you decide to support this endeavor beyond the lowest donation tier, you have the option to receive... </p>
<ul>
<li>Exclusive one-of-a-kind acoustic vinyl</li>
<li>Personalized Poem</li>
<li>Personalized art copy of ""the New Times""</li>
<li>Link to a demos and B-side album on Bandcamp</li>
<li>Personalized Birthday songs</li>
<li>A DARE!!!! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The number one worry for this campaign you should be aware of, is that recording might become more taxing than imagined. While I'm very prepared to go in with everything from instrumental choice, BPM, and effects I want, in all likelihood, certain songs might take more time. Some songs might not sound right and need whole days to complete. While every dollar will go to the creation of this album. It's also possible that the set budget might not be enough. </p>
<p>However I can assure that myself and my collaborators are prepared and ready to churn out a good and non-rushed project for you. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While anything from 5 bucks to a million dollars will help, I understand if you cannot help. <br/>If that is the case, you can help in other ways! </p>
<ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Perennial Millennial is, in essence, an experimental folk and concept album about the plight of the Millennial generation. An oft derided age group, dog piled upon, thanks to the age of technology where every baby boomer with a keyboard can write a scathing attack about how Millennials killed the auto industry, McDonalds, their dog, etc. etc. We also come from an age where we remember when phones were connected to the wall, and we had to wait for our favorite show to come on. Nurtured in an older time, but growing up in a rapidly advancing world; the old versus the new. 
I've had the idea for a while of writing something like this, and in an extremely prolific couple of months for me, I churned out some of my most personal, political, and dense tracks. These tracks all connect and run through the theme of feeling disenfranchised and lost in a culture that does not reflect how the younger generation feels. 
The songs cover many topics

Social justice and reform
Old media versus new media
Feelings of inadequacy in different contexts
Love and heartbreak
Being a millennial

The album takes place on a city sidewalk, and documents a young man coming into his own. I hope when you listen to the final product, you enjoy it, despair with it,  and find yourself reflected in the music. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
All funds for this campaign go to production, mixing, and mastering as well as promotional material; for this we need roughly $3000. If you decide to support this endeavor beyond the lowest donation tier, you have the option to receive... 

Exclusive one-of-a-kind acoustic vinyl
Personalized Poem
Personalized art copy of ""the New Times""
Link to a demos and B-side album on Bandcamp
Personalized Birthday songs
A DARE!!!! 


Risks & Challenges
The number one worry for this campaign you should be aware of, is that recording might become more taxing than imagined. While I'm very prepared to go in with everything from instrumental choice, BPM, and effects I want, in all likelihood, certain songs might take more time. Some songs might not sound right and need whole days to complete. While every dollar will go to the creation of this album. It's also possible that the set budget might not be enough. 
However I can assure that myself and my collaborators are prepared and ready to churn out a good and non-rushed project for you. 

Other Ways You Can Help
While anything from 5 bucks to a million dollars will help, I understand if you cannot help. If that is the case, you can help in other ways! 

Sharing with your friends the project, the previous EP, the teaser tracks. Any help in sharing this campaign is a good step! 
Come out to one of the many shows I will do in promotion for the album. Whether its a tour or you too are based in New York City. Coming to a show is an amazing help to independent music. 
If you are an artist yourself, come out to a music video shoot, or give me a message to collaborate! Any and all creatives are welcome to the process.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p style="""">Having just announced several official SXSW showcases and an American mini-tour, The Brute Chorus are ready to take to the stage for their first American shows. The band cut their teeth with a residency at Camden's infamous Hawley Arms, a watering hole popular at the time with the likes of Amy Winehouse and Kate Moss. Championed at a very early stage by The BBC and NME Magazine The Brute Chorus' wild blend of garage rock, blues, and folk music with lyrics populated with characters from Greek mythology and Grimm's fairytales, quickly broke the indie guitar band mould. Their accessible sound has so far managed to escape any generalized genre pigeon-holing as they have gone on to carve out their own genuine, word-of-mouth buzz from their frenzied live shows.</p>
<p style=""""><br/></p>
<p style="""">And what shows! The band have taken it to the people gig by gig across Britain and Europe and have surely proved they can keep up with the big boys through their many support shows for acts as diverse as  ART BRUT, IDA MARIA, THE WOODENTOPS, MARTHA WAINWRIGHT, and THE RUMBLESTRIPS. Their live rep has seen them stand out among the crowd at almost every British music festival of the last three years and they even recorded their debut album LIVE, in one take at London's prestigious Roundhouse venue.</p>
<p style=""""><br/></p>
<p style="""">At the end of 2010 the band had released their sophomore album, How the Caged Bird Sings, to further critical acclaim from the likes of NME, Drowned in Sound, Clash Magazine, Artrocker, The Fly, Zane Lowe, Marc Riley and Steve Lamacq among others. The band's popularity on radio was boosted when they became Artists in Residence on John Kennedy's XFM show for a whole week at the start of 2011 where the famed DJ played live session tracks alongside album cuts, highlighting the standard of the band's live performance and raw rock n' roll spirit. They've also performed live sessions for Radio1 and Radio 6 whilst on TV Channel 4 screened a mini-doc on the band featuring clips of them playing live in Glasgow. Videos for the likes of 'Birdman' (Single of the Week on Kerrang! Radio and Q Radio) received heavy rotations on blogs around the globe as well as being aired on MTV Iggy here in the US. Everyone certainly wants a piece of THE BRUTE CHORUS, and now it's time to get yours.<br/><br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are thrilled to be back in the studio and working to bring a new CD out to the world. We came into music, writing and performing, late in life and if you told us back in 2010 that in 8 years we would have enough original songs for 5 CDs, we would have told you that you were nuts :)  We love performing and connecting with people through our musical stories. With a song you only have 3-4 minutes to pull people into your story and have them feel strongly enough about it to want to take it home with them. We believe that we do that with our songs, which is the main reason we want to keep recording. Through this campaign, we are asking you to help us to bring this project to completion by pre-ordering your CD.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are trying to raise $5000. This is a portion of what it will take to complete this CD. We are doing as many of the tasks associated with creating a CD as we possibly can; we have created our own home studio, so we are able to record and mix ourselves. Also we will do all of the graphic design for our CD packaging, except for the cover art. This will save us a ton of money without sacrificing quality. Here is the breakdown of where your contributions will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>CD Mastering - $1000</li>
<li>CD Duplication and distribution - $2300</li>
<li>DJ promotion - $2000</li>
<li>New promo pictures - $300</li>
<li>CD cover art - $350</li>
<li>Additional PR - $1000-$2000</li>
</ul>
<p>Our stretch goal is an additional $1000 to create a music video. We have plenty of live concert videos so that we can showcase some of our songs but we would like to get a concept, multi camera video.</p>
<p>Now for what you can get as a perk - of course, the new CD itself, but we also have a bunch of other incentives for you:</p>
<p>    T-shirts, hand written lyrics, a song written just for you, lunch on us, house concerts, workshops, record your own 3 song demo, to name a few.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Music brings people together and we need this now more than ever. We put our heart and soul into every song and every performance. Our songs are lyric driven and range from stories based on historical events, to every day life events, to call to action songs. Our hope is that when you listen to our music that you are not only entertained, but that the music touches your soul. Through music we are all connected and we thrive on this feeling of community.</p>
<p>We were very happy with the success of our last CD, <i>This Old Town</i>. With the DJ promotion, we were #11 on the Folk DJ charts. We are hoping that this new CD can break the top 10!</p>
<p>We have been hesitant in the past about asking our family, friends, neighbors, and fans to help us fund our projects, but we do need your help this time. We do not take this lightly and are working very hard to create a project that you will be proud to say that you were a part of.</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>We have perks at many price points, but we realize that you may not be financially able to support us. If that is the case, there are other ways that you can help. Please share this campaign with your friends, family, neighbors, etc. Put it on Facebook, Tweet about it, talk it up everywhere that you can. Word of mouth is huge so letting people know about this project will help us immensely.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a rock band from Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts. We've been a band since 2009, and have been playing music together in various forms since middle school in 2004. Since we started, we've been putting everything into this band. Thanks to all your support, we've made it to the finals of the historic Rock N' Roll Rumble - recorded and released two EP's, a single for the Boston Music Award's 617 Sessions, and caught the attention of WGBH, The Boston Globe, and The Improper Bostonian - all in the past year alone. Since the beginning of February, we've been hard at work making a full length album of what we consider to be our strongest material to date. In order to achieve our full vision, including many studio hours, guest musicians, and the promotion/videos that will follow - we sincerely ask for any help you can give us. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our campaign is $5000, and can broken down into the following:</p>
<p>Recording = $2500</p>
<p>Mixing = $500</p>
<p>Mastering = $1000</p>
<p>CD Pressing/Promotion/Videos = $1000</p>
<p>We've offered a diverse selection of incentives to reach this goal, and in the instance that we happen to surpass our goal, all additional funding will go towards a vinyl release of the record and recording more music. </p>

We've offered a diverse selection of incentives to reach this goal, and in the instance that we happen to surpass our goal, all additional funding will go towards a vinyl release of the record and recording more music.

So, if you’re like me, you’re a total music lover, passionate about all types of music and someone that connects deeply to melodic, harmonic sounds of all types. Music folks are some of my favorite people…whether you’re a songwriter, a musician, a producer, a concert goer or all of the above; you do it, because you love it. Not for money, acclaim, or anything else. And your love of music and sharing your music with others is simply one of the greatest gifts we have in this world.</p><p>So, I’ve been writing songs for 11 years. I’m one of those creative guys who hears melodies in his head all the time. But I've always written songs with the intention that other people would sing them...not me. You can hear a few of my songs here (and 3 from the new album): <a href=""http://www.reverbnation.com/jonathanwuebben"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.reverbnation.com/jonathanwuebben</a></p><p>Now, its MY time to shine and finally take center stage, by writing, arranging, singing and performing my own material! I've gone through all 300 of my songs and selected the 12 very best tunes for this album.</p><p>On the record, there will be 4 up tempo songs, 4 ballads and 4 mid-tempo tunes. Melody will be front and center as will complex chord structures/harmony throughout. Certain songs on this album are the result of years of effort, fine tuning every part of them and making them as beautiful and deep as I possibly could. </p><p>I'm working with Grammy award winning Producer, Doug Grean, on the album as well as a few of the best session musicians in the LA area. I’m thrilled to have the chance to work with these incredible music talents. As I’m a perfectionist with my music, I had to find a team of dedicated folks that were up to the challenge.</p><p>We have big plans for the album and promotion. I'm very confident that we have at least 2, perhaps 3 songs that will do very well in the charts. We'll also be creating music videos for every song on the album. We'll do a massive push of the album through social media and other online channels. (Im also a best selling online marketing author and software creator) This is your chance to get in on an exciting pop music project at the very beginning. </p><p>My two major musical influences are Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys and David Gilmour of Pink Floyd. Pet Sounds is my favorite album of all time and some of the songs on my album we’ll be very similar to these gems. (I hope) I also love Dan Fogelberg, Cat Stevens, David Gates from the 70s band Bread, John Lennon, Todd Rundgren and Bob Marley. And if you picked up a copy of David Gilmour's solo album in 2006, you'll see a couple of my tunes on this album will be similar sounding.

I learned everything I know about writing songs on my own.

He did not survive the birth. I never knew him, and yet I always knew I was a twin, and actually asked my parents about it before they told me.</span></p>
<div>
<p>Wendel Patrick is the name I use for all things Hip Hop and Electronica. As Wendel Patrick I've released two critically acclaimed albums that have been featured by VIBE Magazine, XLR8R Magazine, RE:UP Magazine, URB Magazine and other numerous publications. Kevin Gift is the name I use for all things piano related...usually classical and jazz, but not always. I have fans of each that don't know the other one exists. As a musician I have been fortunate to travel and perform all over the world as a classical, hip hop and jazz musician.</p>
<p>Three of the four albums in this project, ""Travel"", ""Passage"", and ""JDWP"" are Wendel Patrick releases. ""20.TEN."" is a Kevin Gift release of solo piano works. Working on all four of these albums simultaneously over the last year has been exhausting, but simultaneously the most rewarding thing I've ever done both artistically and musically. All four albums are very different. ""Passage"" plays along the lines of an acoustic album by The Roots, or something akin to ""The Philadelphia Experiment"" released in 2001. Every track on ""Travel"" was either written or conceived in a different city while on tour. ""JDWP"" is a J Dilla tribute project featuring my own arrangements of several of my favorite J Dilla sample based tunes, recreated without any sampling.

<p>This is the best music I've ever recorded.

<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What's Needed.<br/></span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>There is a lot that goes into making a recording, both during the recording process and after, and much of it can be costly. As an independent artist I make my own decisions about the music I want to record without having criteria dictated to me by a label. There is nothing requiring me to make something ""catchy"" at the expense of the music I wish to create. I see this as an ideal situation. Reaching the broader public with music in such an environment can be challenging however, which is where adequate publicity and marketing becomes a major factor. A half page ad in a magazine such as FADER can run into the thousands but can have a sizeable impact on spreading the word about a particular album, let alone four. $8000 dollars has been budgeted for publicity and marketing. Physical printing of CD's are usually done by the thousand and cost $1100 per CD or $4400 for all four. If enough money is raised, I will be printing physical copies of all four albums. Vynil pressings will take place as well, and the cost for a run of 800 is $1200. Mixing and mastering of the album has been budgeted at $2500. Travel expenses for collaborating artists has been budgeted at $1500, and mixing and mastering has been budgeted at $1500. Digital distribution for all four albums will cost approximately $300.</p>

</div></div>","My birth name is Kevin Gift. My twin brother's birth name was Wendel Patrick. He did not survive the birth. I never knew him, and yet I always knew I was a twin, and actually asked my parents about it before they told me.

Wendel Patrick is the name I use for all things Hip Hop and Electronica. As Wendel Patrick I've released two critically acclaimed albums that have been featured by VIBE Magazine, XLR8R Magazine, RE:UP Magazine, URB Magazine and other numerous publications. Kevin Gift is the name I use for all things piano related...usually classical and jazz, but not always. I have fans of each that don't know the other one exists. As a musician I have been fortunate to travel and perform all over the world as a classical, hip hop and jazz musician.
Three of the four albums in this project, ""Travel"", ""Passage"", and ""JDWP"" are Wendel Patrick releases. ""20.TEN."" is a Kevin Gift release of solo piano works. Working on all four of these albums simultaneously over the last year has been exhausting, but simultaneously the most rewarding thing I've ever done both artistically and musically.

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">It all started back as an island boy who only knew melodies, watching the King of Pop, Queen, The Police, and falling in love with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole and trying to imitate James Brown and Elvis. Lost in the world of music yet my options were limited, I either could become a doctor, lawyer, a police, or a pastor but not a musician. I was told it was a poor man's dream. Next thing I knew this island boy ended up in the precious state of Virginia on U.S. soil where I</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> started a band called ""The Kase Project"" and within months we became one of the few respected acts in the east coast region. Quickly rising fast. After our time together had ended I saw an opportunity in Nashville as I was determined to not give up on my dream. The funny thing was, in thinking out loud I was like ""what's an island boy doing in the world of country territory"". </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Restart On Love means begin again, redemption, born again, and living out your life while you still have breath. Time, is what Restart On Love means to me. I thought I lost it back in Nashville where my heart was broken into pieces, where my world tumbled down and where I lost all trust in humanity. My time in Nashville didn't last too long, I ended up coming back home. I wanted it so badly, felt it so much and desired to create something bigger that can be enjoyed across multiple countries, cultures, generations, and airwaves beyond where my limbs can take me.</span></p>

Yes, it took many bumps and bruises for the idea and thought to finally hit me. When you do what you're not meant to do your own mind faults you. So why give up? Its never too late to be what you were meant to be while you still have life, while you still breath, and while your passion for people pushes you forward, hoping in return that they will support this lifestyle, passion, cause, and projection, for all future generations to come. </span></p>
<p>With your help we can impact the world together, heal broken hearts, break down walls and barriers that's keeping my words, and songs from your hearts.

<div>One of the biggest challenges I have on this journey is that in The Bahamas we are still developing a much stronger environment of music as we do in culture (Junkanoo). We don't have a competitive music industry, mostly due to regulation. So many people are willing to support you for traditional professions such as becoming a teacher, banker, lawyer, or a doctor but not as an artist. Some say you shouldn't write a book until you've gotten a Phd or have accomplished the world. These setbacks can be a magnitude of noise. So I invented a solution. Create your own video of what Restart On Love means to you then challenge your closest friends, celebrity, sister, brother, lover, teacher, pastor and everyone you know to do the same. You can share your video on <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/kingsleykase"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/kingsleykase</a> all you have to do is click ""Like"". If each of you donate your time and spread the word for this journey, once the goal is reached, I will donate my time with a free concert at a local charity in your honor as well as make a special thank you video with the footage from this event for everyone who supports this.  </div>
<div>If the goal is not reached I hope to utilize the funds to at least accomplish the part of the goal in getting started, no matter the wait. I would just focus on packaging this journey so lives can be impacted in a creative and strategic way.</div>
<div>Furthermore, there are many other ways you can help. </div>
<div>1. Spread the word to everyone you know and tell them to spread the word to everyone they know.</div>
<div>2. Share this campaign on your Facebook pages, Twitter, Youtube, cafe's, and restaurants near you.</div>
<div>3. Find out where I'm performing in future and choose to become a street team member.</div>
<div>4. Join my Facebook page and become apart of this journey by liking videos, sharing videos, and following me on social media wherever I go.</div>
<div>5. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I ask that you learn the songs, sing them, make as many Youtube videos performing my songs and watch me rise. </span>
</div>
<div>This message is more powerful than money but honestly sometimes you need people with wealthy hearts who believe in you, and I truly need more of this. I need your support to help make all these dreams come true. Words of affirmation and quality time are my love languages and so these two things are major motivators in times of doubt.</div>
<div>So please make a lot of noise every where you go and use the fancy indiegogo share tools to help make this journey a reality and that's all to this. I hope we meet in future, so that I can say 'thank you' for your support, and by the looks of it I'm never going to stop saying thank you.</div>

planning stages. We are 99% of the way there. Just over two weeks’ worth of shows
in April have been secured. Scheduled shows in The Netherlands, Italy, Germany and Slovenia are bookended
with appearances at two major festivals; <b>Roadburn NL April 12<sup>th</sup></b> and
<b>Desertfest Berlin April 25th</b>. This tour is a huge opportunity to gain exposure
for the band, and we are dedicated to playing all of these shows with the
passion and energy you’ve come to expect from a <b>GOZU</b> performance. That being said,
we are reaching out to all our fans, old and new, to help us make the tour as successful
as we know it can be. <p></p>
<p>To be clear, this tour does not live or die by this
fundraising campaign…<b>we are going regardless</b>. The goal, with the help of our
amazing fan base (which is the reason why we play in the first place) is to try
and cover some of the known costs we have already incurred, and to set us up
with a small purse of cash for the unforeseen incidentals that will undoubtedly
arise while in Europe. </p>
<p>As you may or may not know, there are many costs tied to a
venture like this. Transportation, instrument rentals, and housing accommodations
are the obvious ones. But…</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Did you know it costs about <b>$100</b> dollars a day to feed
the band and crew?</li>
<li>Or that baggage fees for checking our instruments
onto the plane can cost anywhere from <b>$200-$500</b> dollars on top of the ticket prices?
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Fuel is expensive, taxes on just about
everything we’ll need while we are there are also expensive. </li>
</ul><p>
</p><p>These are just a few of the types of costs that are quickly
adding up as we enter the final stages of preparation for the tour. Our plan was
to use merchandise sales to pay for all of these related expenses, but that is a
variable, so we hope you can help us out. Each dollar raised will make a huge
difference for us while on the road. </p>
<p>The band came up with some really cool and unique incentives
to thank those of you who choose to donate to our campaign. Beyond the usual tunes,
t-shirts and posters, we decided we wanted to include some exclusive music and special
personalized incentives that will allow us to connect with fans in some cool
ways. So please take a look, and as always we thank you for your continuing support.

<br/><p></p></div>","GOZU is set to embark on their first ever European tour. The tour is entering the final
planning stages. We are 99% of the way there. Just over two weeks’ worth of shows
in April have been secured. Scheduled shows in The Netherlands, Italy, Germany and Slovenia are bookended
with appearances at two major festivals; Roadburn NL April 12th and
Desertfest Berlin April 25th. This tour is a huge opportunity to gain exposure
for the band, and we are dedicated to playing all of these shows with the
passion and energy you’ve come to expect from a GOZU performance. That being said,
we are reaching out to all our fans, old and new, to help us make the tour as successful
as we know it can be. 
To be clear, this tour does not live or die by this
fundraising campaign…we are going regardless. The goal, with the help of our
amazing fan base (which is the reason why we play in the first place) is to try
and cover some of the known costs we have already incurred, and to set us up
with a small purse of cash for the unforeseen incidentals that will undoubtedly
arise while in Europe. 
As you may or may not know, there are many costs tied to a
venture like this. Transportation, instrument rentals, and housing accommodations
are the obvious ones. But…


Did you know it costs about $100 dollars a day to feed
the band and crew?
Or that baggage fees for checking our instruments
onto the plane can cost anywhere from $200-$500 dollars on top of the ticket prices?


Fuel is expensive, taxes on just about
everything we’ll need while we are there are also expensive. 

These are just a few of the types of costs that are quickly
adding up as we enter the final stages of preparation for the tour. Our plan was
to use merchandise sales to pay for all of these related expenses, but that is a
variable, so we hope you can help us out. Each dollar raised will make a huge
difference for us while on the road. 
The band came up with some really cool and unique incentives
to thank those of you who choose to donate to our campaign. Beyond the usual tunes,
t-shirts and posters, we decided we wanted to include some exclusive music and special
personalized incentives that will allow us to connect with fans in some cool
ways. So please take a look, and as always we thank you for your continuing support.

Love, GOZU

<h3>Hi there! We are a group of people called <em>Psalmodia</em> (<em>latin</em> core part of the Christian Liturgy of the Hours). We are a Polish academic Choir from Cracow, based at the Pontifical University of John Paul II.</h3>
<p>Currently there are around 60 persons who actively participate in the rehearsals. Despite the ""academic"" aspect, many of us have stayed here much longer than just during our studying time. We love music, singing, the wonderful atmosphere, our magnificent conductor and, last but not least, we love each other. So much that we simply cannot say ""bye"" to the choir. At least, not when the proper time comes. Visit us at our website (<a href=""http://www.psalmodia.pl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.psalmodia.pl</a>) or on You Tube channels: the old one (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/puericapsalmodienses"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/puericapsalmodienses</a>) and the new one (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/user/ChorPsalmodia/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/user/ChorPsalmodia/videos?flow=grid&amp;view=0</a>).</p>
<p>Allegedly, we are the best academic choir in Cracow (it's a wonderful historic city in Southern Poland - the cradle of Polish identity, culture, art and music). Some people say even that we sound like  a professional choir, which we are often too shy to agree. We only do our job. Wait! It's not a job - almost none of us are musicians - there are, however, many other professionals: pharmacists, linguists, lawyers, doctors, engineers, mathematicians etc. And students, of course :) It's our passion, our ""life after life"".</p>
<p>We give concerts (mainly in the neighbourhood of Cracow), we cooperate with other choirs and orchestras (Polish Radio Choir, Cracow Philharmonics, Cracow Opera, Capella Cracoviensis, Howard Shore, Tan Dun, Joe Hisaishi, Krzysztof Penderecki) we travel (we've visited so far Italy, Spain, Hungary, Sweden... and we want more!), we enter competitions (majority of which, we actually win :)) and at times we also record CDs.</p>
<p>In February 2011, we recorded our first CD with Polish choral music. We had an idea that nobody has had so far - we want to create a sort of anthology of great Polish compositions for choir, both <em>a capella</em> (without instruments) and with accompaniment. So, the first CD comprised works of the most renowned Polish contemporary composer - the late Henryk Mikołaj Górecki (we probably don't need to tell you how magnificent he was, the whole world has been amazed with his orchestra and choral pieces. If, by any chance, someone has never heard of the guy - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B3recki"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B3recki</a>). The <em>a capella</em> album was a great challenge and achievement - we had even a phonographic world premiere!</p>
<p>The second CD in the cycle (which is Psalmodia's third album in general) was recorded this year - in March. It is fully devoted to Stanisław Moniuszko - a great Polish composer, initiator of the Polish national opera and the creator of the Polish artistic song (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Moniuszko"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Moniuszko</a>).</p>
<p>Due to funds raised by the PassionArt Artistic Association (established by members of the choir) we were able to record the <em>Latin Mass in D-flat Major</em>, 3 motets and 2 organ preludes. That is not, however, or at least shouldn't be, the end of the work.</p>
<p>We need to find money to release the recorded material. Since our University is not a big entity, and the Association has already done what they could, we need to turn to other people who would be able to help.</p>
<p>The whole cycle, so the CD we are trying to publish as well, is aimed at popularizing and spreading Polish music and Polish composers, and believe me - they are truly magnificent. Although the works are often performed live, they have never been recorded - it would be a pity if the world does not hear about our national pride! :) We want to make a change.</p>

</h3><p>
</p><p>In
the spring of 2013 Molasses Creek worked feverishly on an album of new material
for local release at the Ocrafolk Festival in June. We were very excited about
new songs such as Marcy's ""Joe Bell Flowers"" and ""Five Minutes"",
Fiddler Dave's ""Death My Friend"", new instrumentals ""Tico
Creeko"" and Gerald's ""Ehringhaus Blues"", Louie's take on
""Galway Girl"" and ""My Window Faces the South"", Phil Kelly's
great new song ""Something Worth Having"", and a fresh remake of Gary's
classic ""The Waterman"".<br/><br/>
Working with Nashville producer Kari Estrin on the international release of this album,
we were motivated to revisit all of the songs and tweak, fine tune, remix and
re-record tracks as needed until we were all thrilled with the result! We even
added a new-old song that we've been having a lot of fun with which we call
""The Yazoo Choo Choo"".<br/><br/>
The resulting recording, ""Something Worth Having"", was just mastered by Grammy-winning engineer Charlie Pilzer at Airshow Mastering
and is now off to the duplicators! Our international promotion of the new CD
will launch in February of 2014.  Working with Kari Estrin, we will be sending the album
to over 500 radio stations across the US, Canada, and Europe, hoping to beat
our last record of #4 on the Folk Radio DJ Charts.</p>

<h3>WHY
ARE WE DOING SUCH A SILLY THING?</h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/214340/files/20131121105847-P1010012.JPG?1385060327"" src="""" style=""width: 390.667px; height: 293px;""/></p><p><i>(Fiddler Dave sensed that being a street musician didn't earn what it used to . . .)</i><br/></p><p>Our fans might have noticed that we have
significantly stepped up our touring over the past 3 years.  With a new band van and even more
get-up-n-go we want to take our performances to larger concert halls and more
places.  The first thing the owners
of the venues ask when we contact them is . . .  “Do you have an audience around here who has heard of you
and will beat down the doors?” 
National promotion of our latest recording is a critical part of the
puzzle.</p><p></p>
<p>In
addition to this radio push, we are planning to attend the Folk
Alliance International Conference in Kansas City, MO in February to spread the word about the
band and hobnob with presenters from all across the continent.  It is going to take a lot of fig
preserves and Joe Bell seeds to get their attention!</p>

of these dreams cost a good deal of money.  After spending $10-15,000 just to make a recording it will
take another $10-15,000 to do the promotional plan.  While we certainly wouldn’t ask our fans to foot the whole
enchilada, we are hoping that everyone pulling together can raise about $10,000
for this campaign.  If you are
interested in the details of what each part of the project costs here is more

upon a similar campaign working with Kari Estrin Management to promote our
release ""An Island Out of Time."" Our #4 chart success during the first
campaign resulted in Molasses Creek exposure across the folk music world,
invitations to major venues like the LEAF festival (Lake Eden Arts
Festival), Floydfest, the legendary Caffé Lena concert hall in Saratoga Springs,
NY, an official showcase at the Northeast Regional Folk Alliance Conference, and an
appearance on the nationally syndicated Woodsongs Old Time Radio Hour out of
Lexington, KY.<p></p>
<p>We
need to remind the Folk Music World that we are still here and much more than a flash in the pan.  We eagerly anticipate that this next national promotion will result in Molasses
Creek’s music spreading even further, more concerts in more places to a greater
number of fans! <br/></p><p></p><h3>WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON’T REACH OUR GOAL?</h3>

Molasses Creek chose Indiegogo crowd fundraising for two
main reasons.  (1) Unlike
Kickstarter, Indiegogo takes credit cards even if you don’t have a PayPal
account, and (2) Indiegogo offers campaigns with flexible funding which means
that we keep the funds we raise even if we don’t reach our goal (and YOU GET TO KEEP YOUR HOLIDAY PLEDGE PRIZES FROM THE MOMENT YOU CONTRIBUTE!).  If we make
our goal Indiegogo charges 4% fee, if we don’t then they charge 9% fee.  Big incentive to go out and shake the trees!  If we don’t raise our
complete goal we may have to tailor our plans for the Folk Alliance
International conference, so we will keep our fingers crossed.  If we raise more than our goal than it
means that we can spend more time making great music and less time running
fundraisers!<br/><p></p>

need to remind the Folk Music World that we are still here and much more than a flash in the pan.  We eagerly anticipate that this next national promotion will result in Molasses
Creek’s music spreading even further, more concerts in more places to a greater
number of fans! WHAT HAPPENS IF WE DON’T REACH OUR GOAL?

Molasses Creek chose Indiegogo crowd fundraising for two
main reasons.  (1) Unlike
Kickstarter, Indiegogo takes credit cards even if you don’t have a PayPal
account, and (2) Indiegogo offers campaigns with flexible funding which means
that we keep the funds we raise even if we don’t reach our goal (and YOU GET TO KEEP YOUR HOLIDAY PLEDGE PRIZES FROM THE MOMENT YOU CONTRIBUTE!).  If we make
our goal Indiegogo charges 4% fee, if we don’t then they charge 9% fee.  Big incentive to go out and shake the trees!  If we don’t raise our
complete goal we may have to tailor our plans for the Folk Alliance
International conference, so we will keep our fingers crossed.  If we raise more than our goal than it
means that we can spend more time making great music and less time running
fundraisers!
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
We have tried to make sure
that everyone can have the opportunity to jump in and join the fun.  EVEN A SMALL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM FOLKS CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE.  HELP SPREAD THE WORD AMONGST YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS, ON FACEBOOK, THE WEB, AND BY TALKING IT UP.

<div>Hello, my name is Kristin Murray and I am twenty eight years old with a passion for human betterment and have had this passion since I was five years old, when I had tried to send an envelope filled with cheezles to the starving Bangladeshi children that I had seen on the television. </div>
<div>I have travelled extensively throughout the world and have seen the extreme poverty and what those less off than I have to endure daily, and like the young girl with the cheezles that I once was- I still very much want to help these people in need. </div>
<div>On my travels I have had the opportunity to be involved in and learn from many not for profit organisations whom work with peoples in developing countries, such as restaurants whom employ street children in the Vietnam, a workshop which employs women that come from a community that lives on a rubbish dump in Nicaragua, massage parlours that train and employ blind people in Vietnam, a restaurant that employs people with down syndrome in Indonesia and so on. </div>
<div>From these experiences I have been able to build upon my own ideas of how I would like to help improve the lives of those less fortunate than myself and have come up with the <b>Mum's Off The Streets </b>foundation<b>.  </b>
</div>
<div>Mums Off The Streets' main focus will be housing and feeding homeless mothers and their children in Bangladesh, which will progress to training in the workforce and schooling for their children.</div>
<div>The foundation is a <b>minimum</b> three month program that will house, feed, tend to the health needs of and train the women in the workforce, giving them skills so that they can find a job. If, at the end of the program any of the women are not yet ready to leave the house, they will be welcomed to stay until they are. No mothers will be put back onto the streets. </div>
<div>Depending on how successful the foundation becomes will determine how many mothers will be off the streets and in our care. This may mean that I will in future need to purchase/rent another living space for more mothers and children.</div>
<div>The plan: </div>
<div>I will purchase a large house in Bangladesh and hire two women trained in arts and craft to teach eight women (four women each) to begin with, how to make arts and crafts, which I will be able to sell online as well as in Australia to pay for the foundation's expenses. </div>
<div>All of the training, cooking, eating and sleeping will be onsite in a safe location and I will hire two mums to care for the duties of cooking and cleaning, with their payment being food and board. </div> <p>The house that I will purchase will require a large room that I will use as the workshop for the women, along with garage which I will turn into a classroom for volunteers to teach the children of the mothers whilst the mums are working or learning arts and crafts skills which will empower them for life.</p>
<p>This is your chance to be part of something that will help the world change for the better, no matter how small your contribution is, it will be appreciated with the same amount of gratitude as the next contribution. </p>

<p>To start this foundation I have estimated the cost to be $150, 000 dollars. </p>
<p>The houses that I have looked at online that are big enough to create a living space for maximum twenty four women and children start at around $100,000, leaving $50,000.</p>
<p>The minimum wage in Bangladesh is $30 dollars a month, and I would like to pay above this to the women who will be training the mothers. This means for the first year of the foundation the cost of wages will be at the minimum $720, leaving approximately $49,000.</p>
<p>The cost of food for one person per year is at a maximum of $340, meaning that to feed 24 people for the first year of the foundation would come to $8,160, and although the foundation would by that stage be self sufficient, I would like to budget for this just incase. </p>
<p>This would leave approximately $40,000 to buy the materials for the arts and crafts, to pay for water, electricity and land rates.</p>
<p>What you get!</p>
<p>To raise money for this foundation I am making and selling jewellery, much like the jewellery that the mothers will be taught to make. I am also in the process of writing childrens books as well as a biography on my travels to raise funds for the foundation, however the books are still in the making. </p>
<p>The unique, handmade jewellery on the other hand, is now very readily available and depending on what you can afford you can buy for yourself, your partners and even for your entire family! And you can do so knowing that not only are you helping me to live my dream, but you will be saving mothers and their children from living impoverished lives on the streets with the constant worry of where they will sleep and where they get their next meal from.</p>
<p>If it happens that I do not reach my initial goal of $150,000 dollars, the foundation will be going ahead all the same. I am dedicated for life to this goal, it has been a long time in the making and I have never given up. I know that it will happen, one way or another. The experience that I have had in other organisations such as the one that I am starting assure me of this.</p>
<p>If I don't have enough money to start the foundation the way that I have described above, I will be doing so in an alternate way, for example I could buy a smaller house, buy land and build a house on it, or even rent a place for the women and children to live. </p>
<p>If you don't have the money to spare but feel moved to help homeless mothers and children, you can help just by forwarding my message and goal, as you can connect to people that I may not be able to, meaning that whatever they can donate is because of you. </p>

</div><h4>Now heading
into its third year, Casse-Tête: A Festival of Experimental Music needs your
support. </h4><p>We want to continue to offer Prince George audiences music they would never
otherwise get to hear, performed by musicians from around Canada and beyond, and
including some of Prince George’s own most radical artists. Let’s keep up the
momentum and broaden the festival’s outreach to the community!</p>
<h4>How we started</h4><p>In 2013,
Prince George witnessed the birth of Casse-Tête: A Festival of Experimental
Music, conceived as a festival of challenging music from a wide range of
traditions and practices with a local core supplemented by visiting artists.
Over two days at The Exploration Place Museum and Science Centre in Fort George
Park, around 100 people heard incredible music that had never been given a
remotely comparable platform in the region before. The festival was an
artistic, financial, and social success, prompting the decision to continue.</p><h4>How we kept it going</h4>
<p>2014’s
festival was a much larger affair than 2013’s, beginning with the spectacular
Piano Drop from the roof of the museum, continuing into a panel discussion,
followed by two more days of music at TEP, now utilizing both the Kordyban
Learning Centre and the beautiful atrium. Artists came from much farther afield
than the first year, exposing local musicians to unique playing opportunities
and local audiences to unbelievable listening opportunities. Including the
Piano Drop, attendance at the festival topped 300 people, and fundraising efforts
were rewarded by a vastly larger production, which was also more fairly
remunerative to the participants. </p><h4>Where we are now</h4>
<p>2015’s
festival is growing again, and continues to experiment with its own structure
and possibilities. To increase the capacity of the festival, a society has been
created to deliver it: the Casse-Tête Festival Society. This society’s mission
and mandate extend beyond the festival itself, but the festival is the most
important activity in its present conception. Important to note is that anyone
who buys a festival pass is eligible for a membership, and anyone who buys a
membership gets a festival pass!</p>
<p>This year’s event
features outstanding local, regional, and visiting artists, including Costa
Rican composer Susan Campos Fonseca, Rodney Sharman, Adrian Verdejo, Jonathon
Wilcke, locals Christians, Jose Delgado-Guevara, Cathy Lewis, Dave Chokroun, Shane
Krause, Darren Williams, Stanley Zappa, The Phobic Trust, Blocktreat, Rebecca
Bruton, Peter Stevenson, Alexandra Spence, Poet-in-Residence Donato Mancini, and
so many more. Like last year, we are relying on donations and sponsorships as
well as ticket sales to cover the expenses related to such an undertaking, most
of which are artists’ fees. Again, the budget has increased a great deal to
reflect the increase in artists’ travel costs, since we are bringing so many
from so far afield. </p>
<p>Like last
year, sponsors like The Exploration Place have been immensely generous and
supportive; the festival’s budget is very lean and carefully planned; and
almost all of our costs are artists’ fees, and yet the artists almost all
shoulder a share of their own costs to perform here because they simply care
that much. We need your help in welcoming them as warmly, and supporting them
as thoroughly as we can.</p>
<h4>The producer</h4>
<p>I’m Jeremy
Stewart, Casse-Tête’s Festival Producer. I’m an arts professional as well as an
artist, with over 15 years of experience producing concerts, as well as working
for years in the non-profit sector, including work for Theatre North West,
Island Mountain Arts (where I was ArtsWells Festival Coordinator), and the
Community Development Institute. I created Casse-Tête because I wanted to share
the music I love with my community, and because I wanted to share my community
with the music I love. I also like to play the guitar and write poems. I grew
up right here in Prince George and I love to see the city flourish.</p>
<h4>How we will thank our supporters</h4>
<p>The
incentives to donate consist of some very special, top-quality handmade
commemorative and documentary items, along with utterly unique physical
artifacts of the triumph of last year’s Piano Drop. </p>
<p>Everyone who
donates will be recognized in the program. You deserved to be recognized as
contributors to the good of this community. </p>
<p>Depending on
the level of your contribution, you can receive everything from an exclusive,
hand-bound chapbook by the Casse-Tête Poet Laureate inspired by the festival,
to an exclusive CD library of recordings of festival performances; to an
exclusive commemorative photo book. Each of these items will be produced by
artists with the greatest care and be of high quality. Your generosity really,
really matters to us, and we want you to know it!</p>
<p>We also have
options for interested businesses inclined to support Prince George’s
development in this way; these are sponsorships, and thus the associated
benefits are promotional in nature. </p>
<h4>Help us make a great city even better</h4>
<p>Let me ask
you this: what kind of city do we want to have? What kind of dreams do we want
to dream here, and do we think they can come true or don’t we? It’s not just
about the future; it’s about the present. Supporting Casse-Tête is something
you can do right now to help make Prince George the place we’re dreaming of. Of
course, this is also an investment in the city’s future, giving our community
access to art that is otherwise not available here, whether that’s the
incredible visiting artists coming from all over Canada and beyond, or our own,
brilliant local talent who otherwise would not have access to this kind of
showcase. Casse-Tête brings Prince George to the world, and it brings the world
to Prince George in a fresh, beautiful way.</p>
<p>If you can't
afford to donate, I understand! I thank you in advance, however, for sharing
this campaign as widely as possible, and of course, do pick up your festival
pass or evening performance tickets  from Books &amp; Company, available now,
or order your pass from <a href=""http://cassetetefestival.tumblr.com/tickets"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cassetetefestival.com</a>.</p></div>","**UPDATE** Donate at the $50 level or higher, receive a one-of-a-kind, original bird drawing by Jose Delgado-Guevara!

for years in the non-profit sector, including work for Theatre North West,
Island Mountain Arts (where I was ArtsWells Festival Coordinator), and the
Community Development Institute. I created Casse-Tête because I wanted to share
the music I love with my community, and because I wanted to share my community
with the music I love. I also like to play the guitar and write poems. I grew
up right here in Prince George and I love to see the city flourish.
How we will thank our supporters
The
incentives to donate consist of some very special, top-quality handmade
commemorative and documentary items, along with utterly unique physical
artifacts of the triumph of last year’s Piano Drop. 
Everyone who
donates will be recognized in the program. You deserved to be recognized as
contributors to the good of this community. 
Depending on
the level of your contribution, you can receive everything from an exclusive,
hand-bound chapbook by the Casse-Tête Poet Laureate inspired by the festival,
to an exclusive CD library of recordings of festival performances; to an
exclusive commemorative photo book. Each of these items will be produced by
artists with the greatest care and be of high quality. Your generosity really,
really matters to us, and we want you to know it!
We also have
options for interested businesses inclined to support Prince George’s
development in this way; these are sponsorships, and thus the associated
benefits are promotional in nature. 
Help us make a great city even better
Let me ask
you this: what kind of city do we want to have? What kind of dreams do we want
to dream here, and do we think they can come true or don’t we? It’s not just
about the future; it’s about the present. Supporting Casse-Tête is something
you can do right now to help make Prince George the place we’re dreaming of. Of
course, this is also an investment in the city’s future, giving our community
access to art that is otherwise not available here, whether that’s the
incredible visiting artists coming from all over Canada and beyond, or our own,
brilliant local talent who otherwise would not have access to this kind of
showcase. Casse-Tête brings Prince George to the world, and it brings the world
to Prince George in a fresh, beautiful way.
If you can't
afford to donate, I understand! I thank you in advance, however, for sharing
this campaign as widely as possible, and of course, do pick up your festival
pass or evening performance tickets  from Books & Company, available now,
or order your pass from www.cassetetefestival.com.",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Frankly, putting on concerts takes money. We are looking to raise $20,000 from this campaign to help.</p>
<p>While ticket sales will ultimately cover our costs, we do need to pay numerous upfront expenses prior to each concert such as the venue and seating, printing the programs, ticket sales promotions, etc. All these items do add up. Every dollar we receive will help to defray these expenses.</p>
<p>In return, first of all, you get our undying gratitude. We will always appreciate the help you give us.</p>
<p>Secondly, we will recognize you as a Founding Sponsor in this year's concert programs.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will help us create and sustain a music series that delivers only excellence, allowing us to present and promote the best of chamber music.</p>

<p>If we meet our targets this first year we anticipate driving donations of more than $100,000 to these charities. That's a fivefold increase from this campaign's goal.</p>

<p>In our resume we have an EP called “We need time” featuring Mike Watt (Minuteman) on vocals in the title-track.

The record is called ""Here it comes, Tramontane!"" and will be available after our return from our tour in China.</p>
<p>China is not nearby. We can’t get there with our van, that by the way is named Flauto, and when you do get there it would be worth to come back with something more than just a great personal experience. That’s why we decided to film a documentary of our trip possibly with the best means possible to accomplish this.</p>
<p>It’s not going to be a documentary about us as much as about the DIY scene in China from our point of view and about our experiences. A way to shine new light on things and inspire reflection through an open dialogue.  Also a way to show how we relate to our environment as well as how our Chinese friends relate to theirs. </p>

<h3>What?</h3>
<p>Since early 2011, I have had it in my head that I wanted to make a concept album based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft. After some initial sessions in the Spring of 2011, I had a solid concept for an album entitled ""Strange Aeons"", but the music had not gestated quite long enough to mature, and my ideal packaging based on my concept was financially unsound even with help. In keeping with the storyline I developed, I wanted to include the album in an old fashioned journal, complete with handwritten entries from a character who is slowly losing his mind. I shelved the project in June of 2011, disappointed but knowing it was the right thing to do at the time.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/828942/pictures/full/20130524082656-open.jpg?1369409221"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In August of 2012, I completed and released another record, and knew as I finished that Strange Aeons would have to be the next project on my docket. I'm finally rounding the corner, and with some assistance I have figured out a plan to handmake every single package and handwrite every word in the 12-page liner notes/journal.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/828943/pictures/full/20130524082723-disc.jpg?1369409246"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>The catch of course is that art supplies are not cheap. Each copy consists of faux leather, suede lining, suede rope, thick canvas paper, book binding glue, a cd sleeve, and a professionally replicated cd. This is disregarding things like thread, ink, and above all, time. The funding for this will partially pay for the supplies to make this album as I've seen it in my head a reality; I'm actually taking a financial hit even with the goal in mind, multiple times over with time considered.</p>
<p>If this project surpasses the goal, it will fund further supplies for any paid for copies and online promotion of the digital copy of the album.</p>
<p>Note: If demand is overwhelming, delivery dates may slip by 2-3 weeks. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/851377/pictures/full/20130604202214-deepone2.jpg?1370402539"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>What again?</h3>
<p>Strange Aeons is a ten-song concept album that takes place within the world of H. P. Lovecraft's fiction. The storyline is new, but is inspired by and directly affected by several characters and stories from within Lovecraft's mythos. The sound is primarily electronic, but there are plenty of ""acoustic"" (meaning non-electronic) elements as well. The genre ranges from Industrial Rock to Pop.</p>

</div></div>","What?
Since early 2011, I have had it in my head that I wanted to make a concept album based on the works of H. P. Lovecraft. After some initial sessions in the Spring of 2011, I had a solid concept for an album entitled ""Strange Aeons"", but the music had not gestated quite long enough to mature, and my ideal packaging based on my concept was financially unsound even with help. In keeping with the storyline I developed, I wanted to include the album in an old fashioned journal, complete with handwritten entries from a character who is slowly losing his mind. I shelved the project in June of 2011, disappointed but knowing it was the right thing to do at the time.

In August of 2012, I completed and released another record, and knew as I finished that Strange Aeons would have to be the next project on my docket. I'm finally rounding the corner, and with some assistance I have figured out a plan to handmake every single package and handwrite every word in the 12-page liner notes/journal.



Why?
The catch of course is that art supplies are not cheap. Each copy consists of faux leather, suede lining, suede rope, thick canvas paper, book binding glue, a cd sleeve, and a professionally replicated cd. This is disregarding things like thread, ink, and above all, time. The funding for this will partially pay for the supplies to make this album as I've seen it in my head a reality; I'm actually taking a financial hit even with the goal in mind, multiple times over with time considered.
If this project surpasses the goal, it will fund further supplies for any paid for copies and online promotion of the digital copy of the album.
Note: If demand is overwhelming, delivery dates may slip by 2-3 weeks.

<p>Hey kind friends,</p>
<p>We are The Neckbeard Boys, a San Francisco based bluegrass group. Like Dylan said, we want to make our first full length album. We have six members: Dylan, Thom, Karuna, Aaron, Evan and Tim. As you may know, the music industry is changing, and because so much music is accessible on the internet, large record labels are becoming a thing of the past. These days money is all in live performances, but the question is ""How the heck can a band afford to make a record?!?"" San Francisco has branded a new sound of bluegrass that is emerging and shaping the live music scene. Maybe people are fed up with the droning beat of a computer and are looking for that irreplaceable organic sound of wood and steel? Who knows, but ya'll-ternative is NOT dead. In fact, quite the opposite. </p>
<p>The Neckbeard Boys have been together for just over three years. We've played venues all over the city including the corner of Haight and Ashbury, Amnesia, The Rickshaw Stop, The Boom Boom Room, Brick and Mortar Music Hall, and much more. Now it's time for us to record an album. </p>
<p>Our songs are dialed, and we want to share them with you, our fans, and the world. We want to bring you the best quality recording we can. We've locked down the time and place and have reserved the best producers and engineers...we just want to make sure we're not writing checks we can't cash. </p>
<p>Why donate? Well in addition to becoming a part of The Neckbeard Family we have a bunch of awesome incetives. The perks have been carefully chosen by the boys, and are made up of limited Neckbeard Boys merchandise that shows our love for you all. They are great for gifts, or just for you. </p>
<p>Your funding will help us pay for studio time, recording engineers, and post-production. The band will be traveling to New Orleans to make the album to ensure that we get the most authentic sound. Our sound engineers are talented at capturing the beauty and warmth of stringed instruments, a skill that is harder to come by these days. More than this, your money will help a local group continue to make music that moves you and will also help keep west coast bluegrass alive and well.</p>

<p>My name is Dara Tucker. I'm a jazz singer based in Nashville, TN. I'm working on my 3rd studio CD project, and this will be my most personal project to date. I have a stockpile of original songs that have never made their way to one of my albums -- until now. </p>

<p>We're really interested in making a project that represents where we are creatively RIGHT NOW. We'll be incorporating 80% original music, with a couple of choice covers.

<h3>How Will I Get There? Your Support!</h3>
<p>There are three countries I will be visiting over the course of 30 days: Argentina, Chile, and Peru. This allows approximately 10 days per country. The breakdown of my funding need is as follows:</p>
<p><br/>    1.    TRANSPORTATION - Bus fair from each major city to the next <br/>                     (Buenos Aires-Santiago-Cuzco)<br/>    2.    LODGING - Estimated nightly charge $50.00/camping is a cheaper option <br/>                      in only more rural areas.<br/>    3.    FILM! - I shoot with a medium format Bronica, that is 6x4.5 (allows me more  <br/>                    frames per 120 roll. 15 shots opposed to 12) Kodak T-MAX 100 120 film <br/>                    is $25.00 per pack of 5.  Leaves me only 75 images per pack, will need <br/>                    tons more of that. I will also be shooting 35mm film, color and BW. Why <br/>                    no digital? I can only use what resources I have available to me, film <br/>                    cameras are all I have ever invested in. I simply believe in the discipline <br/>                    of the photographic processes, not to mention you'll get a better perk in <br/>                    the end!<br/>    4.    FOOD - Since I will be nonstop traveling for a month, stocking up on food <br/>                    when possible will be necessary, especially in some areas that may be <br/>                    more remote than others.</p>
<p><br/>There are a lot of unique and special perks that you can get through your support! All are art friendly and South American themed created by yours truly. Look to see what you can get from a variety of contributions from $6.00 to $500.00. All the way from Friendship bracelets  to a 5ft x 5ft art installation in your apartment/home!<br/><br/>If I unfortunately do not achieve my goal, the funds will primarily go to transportation/lodging. The biggest cut will have to be the film which means, less art for me AND you! &lt;/3</p>
<h3>
<br/><br/>Why Should You Care?</h3>
<p>We are all part of a world, living inside of some spectrum of humanity, where unfortunately that spectrum has been stretched too far from nothingness to totality. There is something to be valued in ""the other"". It may be easier to forget about this spectrum of humanity when you are living in the positive polar opposite, but impossible to forget when you are living under the negative polar opposite. This is why I care. I care because I have made the decision to live a life through differences to better enrich who I am as a person and to enrich others. I made this decision when I was 9 years old to learn a different language, to feel how it is to struggle to communicate. I made this decision when I was 18 years old to be a photographer, to feel how it is to struggle to communicate yet again, but visually. The feeling of experiencing what it is like to be outside of familiarity has opened my eyes to cultures, histories, art, and people that I would have otherwise been blind to.</p>

<br/>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot contribute, but still want to help out, I understand! There is yet three other ways you can help me and I would be forever appreciative!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">    1.    <strong>SPREAD THE WORD!</strong> Tell all your friends, family, coworkers, artists, Spanish classmates-teachers, everyone and anyone!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">    2.    Have any <strong>MIRRORS, BROKEN?</strong> Big or Small? Even if they aren't broken just old and in the way, I'll gladly take them off your hands as a donation towards some installations upon my return!</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">    3.    <strong>HAVE YOU TURNED DIGITAL?</strong> Have any old darkroom equipment? Have any old film laying around? Even if it's expired I'll gladly use that for you! No reason in letting old film go to waste, contact me and I can give you the address to send it to!</p>

There are three countries I will be visiting over the course of 30 days: Argentina, Chile, and Peru. This allows approximately 10 days per country. The breakdown of my funding need is as follows:
    1.    TRANSPORTATION - Bus fair from each major city to the next                      (Buenos Aires-Santiago-Cuzco)    2.    LODGING - Estimated nightly charge $50.00/camping is a cheaper option                       in only more rural areas.    3.    FILM! - I shoot with a medium format Bronica, that is 6x4.5 (allows me more                      frames per 120 roll. 15 shots opposed to 12) Kodak T-MAX 100 120 film                     is $25.00 per pack of 5.  Leaves me only 75 images per pack, will need                     tons more of that. I will also be shooting 35mm film, color and BW. Why                     no digital? I can only use what resources I have available to me, film                     cameras are all I have ever invested in. I simply believe in the discipline                     of the photographic processes, not to mention you'll get a better perk in                     the end!    4.    FOOD - Since I will be nonstop traveling for a month, stocking up on food                     when possible will be necessary, especially in some areas that may be                     more remote than others.
There are a lot of unique and special perks that you can get through your support! All are art friendly and South American themed created by yours truly. Look to see what you can get from a variety of contributions from $6.00 to $500.00. All the way from Friendship bracelets  to a 5ft x 5ft art installation in your apartment/home!If I unfortunately do not achieve my goal, the funds will primarily go to transportation/lodging. The biggest cut will have to be the film which means, less art for me AND you! </3

Why Should You Care?
We are all part of a world, living inside of some spectrum of humanity, where unfortunately that spectrum has been stretched too far from nothingness to totality. There is something to be valued in ""the other"". It may be easier to forget about this spectrum of humanity when you are living in the positive polar opposite, but impossible to forget when you are living under the negative polar opposite. This is why I care. I care because I have made the decision to live a life through differences to better enrich who I am as a person and to enrich others. I made this decision when I was 9 years old to learn a different language, to feel how it is to struggle to communicate. I made this decision when I was 18 years old to be a photographer, to feel how it is to struggle to communicate yet again, but visually. The feeling of experiencing what it is like to be outside of familiarity has opened my eyes to cultures, histories, art, and people that I would have otherwise been blind to.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot contribute, but still want to help out, I understand! There is yet three other ways you can help me and I would be forever appreciative!
    1.    SPREAD THE WORD! Tell all your friends, family, coworkers, artists, Spanish classmates-teachers, everyone and anyone!
    2.    Have any MIRRORS, BROKEN? Big or Small? Even if they aren't broken just old and in the way, I'll gladly take them off your hands as a donation towards some installations upon my return!
    3.    HAVE YOU TURNED DIGITAL? Have any old darkroom equipment? Have any old film laying around? Even if it's expired I'll gladly use that for you! No reason in letting old film go to waste, contact me and I can give you the address to send it to!
*All mirror/photograhic donors can expect a life-long friendship bracelet and thank you post card!

Whether it be music, business management, makeup, or film, we have some talented people in the city of Chicago and all we need is that one chance to show what we can do. I have gathered the best people I can find and now we just need your help to make our dreams a reality. Can you help us make our dreams tangible? Hello my name is Charles H Wonsey and I am a recent film graduate and a Navy veteran.I have been apart of various shoots. I was also an intern for WWE NXT. I have produced 1 short film and Co- Produced another. You can find the trailers for both films by clinking the links.  Escape Genesis https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHSl_yX5FjUColt Love https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHCcnAMeVuY&feature=youtu.beProducing is a very tedious job but I don't mind doing it because its fun and I love what all goes into it. The campaign itself is a big one. We want to shoot a professionally made video for the new song by HottCelleb called Splurge featuring Matti Baybee. The song is great and now I want to have the chance to put visuals to it. This project is important to me because I want to be a producer. Whether is for film, TV, or music is all up for grabs. I want to bring together the best crew and talent to make this something that we all can be proud of to help us all move up on the ladder to be one prong closer to achieving something great. I believe my time and effort is worth it for this project. I loose sleep over it. This is important to not just me but everyone involved. All of you who contribute will help us reach a new height in our careers. You will also be apart of our failures and apart of our successes. You will ultimately help us have the money for great equipment, locations, and the people that we need in the video. Mostly everybody on this project is working for free and they will work hard as if they are getting paid and as the producer I want to pay them for their hard work and effort that they put into this. Your donations will help us exponentially.   A little Bit about HottCellebChristopher Brock also known 
as HottCelleb is 22 years of age. HottCelleb was born and raised on the 
south side of Chicago.  HottCelleb has been doing music since the age of 10.
   Smokey Robinson, Bow Wow, Fabulous, and Kid Ink is people that have inspired
 him over the years.  HottCelleb's goal is to rise to the level of super star and not 
settle for being mediocre in the rap game.A little bit about HottCellebs Manager Peter Brock Peter Brock is  25 years of age. He was born and raised on the South Side of Chicago. Peter is married and has a one year old Son. He's  been managing HottCelleb  for  
2 years now.  His main goal is to make sure his brother reaches super star 
status as a artist.What We Need & What You GetPutting together a budget for a project is time consuming. Especially when you realize after you are done how much said project cost compared to not having those funds. The funds you donate will go towards feeding the crew. ( We do need to eat) Buying Camera equipment and support equipment for the camera. Camera lenses . Lighting always makes a video stand out so we need that too. insurance for the equipment and for the production if possible. ( in case someone gets hurt. ) I would also like to get this on Television. BET, Revolt, MTVU, just to name a few and it cost to submit to these stations. The song is about Splurging so we have to have things in the video that people would Splurge on.  So we need car rentals. we want to rent some exotic cars either the Lamborghini Spyder or the Porsche Boxster. and possible rent other designer items that people would want to splurge on if they had the money. The talent that we want to use in the video charge some steep fees but we need them for the video to be successful. We have some awesome perks that include signed posters, custom HottCelleb shirts, tickets to his mix-tape release party ( if you are in the Chicago area) Also you could have a chance to meet HottCelleb and Matti Baybee on the set of the music video. we also have other perks as well that are worth the donation. If we don't reach our goal of 4500 then what ever is raised will go to the sole production of the video. I'd be unable to pay the crew. and they do have families to feed. We will do the best we can with what you give us if we don't reach our goal. The ImpactThis project is a valuable piece of work and you will be apart of our team.

<p>I'm Laura Tsaggaris (sah-GAIR-iss), and I'm a guitarist, singer and touring songwriter based out of Washington, D.C.  I have independently released two full-length records, completed two U.S. tours, garnered equipment sponsorships and played with lots of great musicians over the past 10 years.  More recently, I've written and begun recording my latest album, to be titled<em> Everyman.</em></p>
<p>I've put in a lot of money and elbow grease to get to this point, and I can't wait for you to hear the results! As an independent artist, however, I don't have a record label or financial backer fronting me the money I need to finish up this album and get it to you.  So, I’m here to ask for some help!<em> </em></p>
<p>You may not know this, but records cost a lot of money to make.  Mixing and mastering are essential steps to getting an album ready to be played on anything from Pandora to commercial radio, and they come at a high price.  Add to that manufacturing a physical product, and you've got a hefty bill to pay.  This could be incredibly overwhelming if I really thought about it...  but, I'd rather not.  I'm just going to make the art and work to raise some money!</p>
<p>To that end, I've come up with some pretty fun packages to offer in return for your generous contributions to make <em>Everyman</em> a reality.  I've set my 30-day goal here at $10,000.  This would give me the final push to get everything mixed, mastered and packaged up for you to hear.  Along with being totally appreciated and awesome, anything more would help me be able to afford any extra musicans the project might need (think pedal steel guitar or horns), get a few professional videos done and hire a radio promoter to spread the word about this album.</p>
<p>You might have a couple of questions at this point...  so, here are some answers!</p>
<p><strong>Can you tell me a little bit about <em>Everyman</em> to help me decide whether I should  support it?</strong><br/>Sure!  So, this is an exciting project for me.  I’ll be heading to Los Angeles for the month of May to team up with a producer who has worked with Ryan Adams, REM, Luscious Jackson, Ed Kowalczyk (of Live) and many others<em>.</em>  Last month, I flew out to meet with him (<a href=""http://www.jamiecandiloro.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.jamiecandiloro.com</a>) and see if we'd be a good fit to work together.  Turns out we are!  We got a ton of work done in a few days, and I found that getting out of my comfort zone here in D.C. really allowed me to focus on a few songs that needed some finishing touches.  It's been great to have a different perspective on my new work, which strikes a balance between the simpler elements of my first album, <em>Proof</em>, and the more complex structures of my last release, <em>Keep Talking</em>.<strong> </strong> The focus will really be on my voice and acoustic guitar playing with this one, so, I'll be getting back to my roots a bit!  <br/>I think <em>Everyman</em> will really connect with a lot of you.  It's a broader art project that places a magnifying glass on the paradox of human existence and the questions it presents — the everyday, seemingly ordinary struggles to conquer fear, insecurity, frustration, judgment and loss through the very human, yet extraordinary, engines of courage, confidence, perseverance, empathy and love.  No matter our sex, gender, race, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status or profession, we are all Everyman.</p>
<p><strong>What is the timing? When will I get my CD???  </strong><br/>All recording will be done at the end of May.  Having to account for mixing, mastering, and manufacturing, the finished product should be to you by September 1st.  I will keep you updated on this timeline!</p>
<p><strong>What is this about tax deductible donations?</strong><br/>I'm <em>thrilled</em> that this project has been sponsored by Fractured Atlas, a 501(c)(3) national non-profit artist service organization.  This means that A PORTION OF YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS ELIGIBLE FOR TAX DEDUCTION!  You automatically receive a receipt upon contributing that can be submitted with your tax return.<strong><em></em></strong><br/><br/><strong>If you have any questions about the campaign, including how to maximize your tax-deductible portion, please contact me at laura@lauratsaggaris.com and I'll be happy to provide answers!</strong></p>
<p>I am really excited to have Fractured Atlas' support and I can't wait to get this album to you.  I am incredibly grateful to you for supporting my music to this point and helping me bring this album to life.  Thank you all for being a part of <em>Everyman</em>.</p>

<h3>Aloha friends,</h3>
<p>my name is Bettina Maureenji and I am so happy to be starting this campaign. It is a real inspiration for my friend Nick Barber and my self to invite you all to support the production of a new Music Album. Some of you might know the album ""Lullabies for the Soul"" which we created together in 2011. So here we are years later diving into a birthing of the new production called 'JOURNEY BEYOND'. Please visit my website <a href=""http://www.bettinamaureenji.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.bettinamaureenji.com</a> to learn more about my work and music. Or follow me on youtube.</p>
<p>Here is a little information about amazing Nick Barber <a href=""https://nickbarbermusic.uk/about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://nickbarbermusic.uk/abou</a>t. He also created the sound track of the wonderful documentary TAWAI produced by my friend Bruce Parry <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZJEMYjsPqI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZJEMYjsPqI</a>. Also here you can see Nick playing for Ram Dass <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1Cfy45upfA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1Cfy45upfA</a></p>
<p>The music that continues to come forth is always an expression of what is happening and evolving within and seen without. In this times on the planet I feel it is utterly important to find a place of peace, balance and stillness within. Yet the willingness to open, to be free and contribute to live for the well being of all is strongly present as well. </p>
<p>This new music is again midwifing us into different states of consciousness or vibration that is ever present and wants to be explored. I do know that these songs can open realms into the unknown and the unseen where transformation can happen.</p>
<p>You will contribute to something that is contributing to raising awareness within which will effect the evolution of consciousness of the collective. This is my passion in this life time. Your support of the production will help Nick and my self to express love through vibration and to spread it around the globe.</p>
<p>We do not need a lot of funding yet some basic production costs need to be covered. Nick and I do not count in the time for composing, rehearsing, the time in the studio or the time of life we devoted through music. Here is what we need to cover:</p>
<p>- costs for production/ mastering CD</p>
<p>- costs for graphic design/ photos CD cover</p>
<p>- costs for print CD</p>
<p>- costs for marketing/ promotion</p>
<p>We have created all kinds of wonderful perks for you to receive for your donation. </p>
<p>We feel that music is magic and magic is what we all need to remember how precious life is. We wish you will enjoy The Journey Beyond bathing in love and beauty while surrendering into the unknown.</p>
<p>Even if you can not donate monetary, you can always donate a loving thought towards this production or share the campaign so others can donate.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for being part of this.</p>
<p>Bettina Maureenji &amp; Nick Barber</p>

my name is Bettina Maureenji and I am so happy to be starting this campaign. It is a real inspiration for my friend Nick Barber and my self to invite you all to support the production of a new Music Album. Some of you might know the album ""Lullabies for the Soul"" which we created together in 2011. So here we are years later diving into a birthing of the new production called 'JOURNEY BEYOND'. Please visit my website www.bettinamaureenji.com to learn more about my work and music. Or follow me on youtube.
Here is a little information about amazing Nick Barber https://nickbarbermusic.uk/about. He also created the sound track of the wonderful documentary TAWAI produced by my friend Bruce Parry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZJEMYjsPqI. Also here you can see Nick playing for Ram Dass https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1Cfy45upfA
The music that continues to come forth is always an expression of what is happening and evolving within and seen without. In this times on the planet I feel it is utterly important to find a place of peace, balance and stillness within. Yet the willingness to open, to be free and contribute to live for the well being of all is strongly present as well. 
This new music is again midwifing us into different states of consciousness or vibration that is ever present and wants to be explored. I do know that these songs can open realms into the unknown and the unseen where transformation can happen.
You will contribute to something that is contributing to raising awareness within which will effect the evolution of consciousness of the collective. This is my passion in this life time. Your support of the production will help Nick and my self to express love through vibration and to spread it around the globe.
We do not need a lot of funding yet some basic production costs need to be covered. Nick and I do not count in the time for composing, rehearsing, the time in the studio or the time of life we devoted through music. Here is what we need to cover:
- costs for production/ mastering CD
- costs for graphic design/ photos CD cover
- costs for print CD
- costs for marketing/ promotion
We have created all kinds of wonderful perks for you to receive for your donation. 
We feel that music is magic and magic is what we all need to remember how precious life is. We wish you will enjoy The Journey Beyond bathing in love and beauty while surrendering into the unknown.
Even if you can not donate monetary, you can always donate a loving thought towards this production or share the campaign so others can donate.
Thank you so much for being part of this.

<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>The Logan Quintet is proud to announce our long-anticipated Christmas Album! The Quintet has a full track listing of original arrangements, but we need your help to secure the funding for recording costs. Please help us to bring these inspiring new arrangements into homes everywhere by making a contribution today!</p>
<h3>The Story of the Logan Quintet</h3>
<p>Quintet members Brynn Vance (violin), McKenzie Clawson (violin), Rebecca Ostermiller (violin), Ryn Haubner-Sheridan (viola), Stephen Mitton (cellist/arranger), and Sara Mitton (piano), first met in Logan, Utah while pursuing performance degrees at Utah State University. Over the next couple of years, Stephen began writing a host of arrangements to play with his wife, Sara, in church and in their home on Sunday evenings. It wasn't long before they began including their old friends in that tradition, and the Logan Quintet was born.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $1,000 to go toward covering studio costs for recording, mixing, and mastering. We also need funds for the creation and duplication of CDs for distribution.</p>
<p>Our donors will receive excellent perks, including digital sheet music downloads, signed CDs, and much more. We want to show you how much your support means to us!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Good music has the power to build faith and provide inspiration for our lives, especially during difficult times. Playing and listening to these arrangements brings a beautiful spirit, and for that reason we want to share them with the world. With your help, we can achieve the recording quality that they truly deserve, and bring them to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Please help us spread the word about this project! Even if you are only able to contribute a very small amount, sharing this project with even a few people will ensure that we reach our goal. Everyone knows a music-lover. Send the link to this project to the music-lovers in your life!</p>

<h3><u>Your PEI Symphony Needs You Now</u></h3>
<p><strong>Time is of the Essence – PLEASE DONATE TODAY!</strong></p>
<p>Like many industries, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed the global professional arts community in financial and structural freefall. Throughout the world, even major organizations are facing uncertain futures. </p>
<p>Closer to home, we here at the PEI Symphony Orchestra (PEISO) are adhering to directives from our public health officials in the nationwide effort to minimize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, for the protection of our audiences, artists, and staff, we were left with no choice but to:</p>
<ul>
<li>cancel the final concert of our 2019-20 season at the Confederation Centre; </li>
<li>cancel two major fundraising events including our annual Night at the Races Gala, Sponsored by Red Shores;</li>
<li>and cut short our popular annual fruit sale at the Charlottetown Farmers' Market. </li>
</ul>
<p>We made these painful decisions unblinkingly, as they were right and necessary to protect the community we love. <strong>But as a consequence, we are now short some $18,500 in critically needed income. </strong></p>
<p><strong>PLEASE ACT AND DONATE TODAY!</strong></p>
<p>Contributing now will help to ensure the continued operation of our symphony through this uncertain time. With your donation, we will pull through this, and continue to bring people together through music in our 2020-21 season and into the future.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><u>What We Need &amp; Why</u></h3>
<p>The PEISO now urgently seeks $12,000 to offset the significant financial strain caused by the pandemic. We will deeply appreciate donations in any amount; every contribution helps!</p>
<p>Your gift will support musicians and staff, venue and music rentals, office and administrative costs and other expenses directly related to our mission of delivering high quality orchestral and chamber music concert events to Islanders.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><u>What You Will Receive in Appreciation for Your Support</u></h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Please see on the right a short list of donation levels, each with a corresponding thank-you gift, ranging from concert tickets, to musician sponsorships, to a private chamber concert for you and your friends (you can even request the repertoire for such an event and we will gladly honour your request if possible)!</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><u>Who We Are</u></span></h3>
<p>The Prince Edward Island Symphony has brought quality orchestral music to our province for more than 50 years. Each four-concert season brings together sixty or more accomplished musicians, including full-time performers and teachers, advanced students and expert players from other professions. </p>
<p>Each season our diverse, multigenerational audience experiences performances that enhance our Island’s cultural and economic life. There's nothing quite like the power, majesty and grace of hearing a live symphony orchestra perform - and the PEI Symphony is the Island's own! </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><u>Our Impact</u></h3>
<p>Our orchestra has a powerful impact on social and economic life here in Prince Edward Island: </p>

<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The PEISO's $250K+ annual budget is primarily used to hire musicians, and to purchase supplies and services right here in PEI, thereby contributing to our local economy.</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The PEISO conducts outreach programs that bring musicians and chamber ensembles to Island schools, nursing homes and community centres.</span></li>

<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The PEISO provides prominent roots/pop songwriters and performers from the Maritimes (artists like Lennie Gallant, David Myles, Tara MacLean and groups like Paper Lions and Vishtèn) to have the exciting opportunity to perform with a live symphonic orchestra, using arrangements often commissioned and scored right here by our local music professionals. <i><strong>But above all…</strong></i></span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The PEISO builds community: We bring talented musicians together who joyfully work collectively to create a beautiful symphonic performance for all those who attend our concerts because of their appreciation and enjoyment of high-quality live symphony orchestra performances.  </span></li>

</div></div>","Your PEI Symphony Needs You Now
Time is of the Essence – PLEASE DONATE TODAY!
Like many industries, the COVID-19 pandemic has placed the global professional arts community in financial and structural freefall. Throughout the world, even major organizations are facing uncertain futures. 
Closer to home, we here at the PEI Symphony Orchestra (PEISO) are adhering to directives from our public health officials in the nationwide effort to minimize the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, for the protection of our audiences, artists, and staff, we were left with no choice but to:

cancel the final concert of our 2019-20 season at the Confederation Centre; 
cancel two major fundraising events including our annual Night at the Races Gala, Sponsored by Red Shores;
and cut short our popular annual fruit sale at the Charlottetown Farmers' Market. 

We made these painful decisions unblinkingly, as they were right and necessary to protect the community we love. But as a consequence, we are now short some $18,500 in critically needed income. 
PLEASE ACT AND DONATE TODAY!
Contributing now will help to ensure the continued operation of our symphony through this uncertain time. With your donation, we will pull through this, and continue to bring people together through music in our 2020-21 season and into the future.

 
What We Need & Why
The PEISO now urgently seeks $12,000 to offset the significant financial strain caused by the pandemic. We will deeply appreciate donations in any amount; every contribution helps!
Your gift will support musicians and staff, venue and music rentals, office and administrative costs and other expenses directly related to our mission of delivering high quality orchestral and chamber music concert events to Islanders.
 
What You Will Receive in Appreciation for Your Support
Please see on the right a short list of donation levels, each with a corresponding thank-you gift, ranging from concert tickets, to musician sponsorships, to a private chamber concert for you and your friends (you can even request the repertoire for such an event and we will gladly honour your request if possible)!

 
Who We Are
The Prince Edward Island Symphony has brought quality orchestral music to our province for more than 50 years. Each four-concert season brings together sixty or more accomplished musicians, including full-time performers and teachers, advanced students and expert players from other professions. 
Each season our diverse, multigenerational audience experiences performances that enhance our Island’s cultural and economic life. There's nothing quite like the power, majesty and grace of hearing a live symphony orchestra perform - and the PEI Symphony is the Island's own! 
 
Our Impact
Our orchestra has a powerful impact on social and economic life here in Prince Edward Island: 

The PEISO brings high-quality orchestral and chamber music concerts to Islanders year-round.
The PEISO's $250K+ annual budget is primarily used to hire musicians, and to purchase supplies and services right here in PEI, thereby contributing to our local economy.
The PEISO conducts outreach programs that bring musicians and chamber ensembles to Island schools, nursing homes and community centres.
The PEISO gives professional PEI musicians, teachers and music students the opportunity to grow as we come together as a musical community to perform outstanding symphonic repertoire to the highest artistic standard. 
The PEISO provides talented young PEI student musicians the opportunity to perform with an orchestra, as regular section members and/or soloists.
The PEISO enables Islanders to encounter talented Canadian composers, guest soloists and guest conductors who are invariably thrilled to discover our orchestra’s excellence, our community’s warmth, and our Island’s overwhelming natural beauty. 
The PEISO provides prominent roots/pop songwriters and performers from the Maritimes (artists like Lennie Gallant, David Myles, Tara MacLean and groups like Paper Lions and Vishtèn) to have the exciting opportunity to perform with a live symphonic orchestra, using arrangements often commissioned and scored right here by our local music professionals. But above all…
The PEISO builds community: We bring talented musicians together who joyfully work collectively to create a beautiful symphonic performance for all those who attend our concerts because of their appreciation and enjoyment of high-quality live symphony orchestra performances.  


 
Other Ways You Can Help
The very best way to support the PEISO is to enjoy our concerts in person! 
While our 2020-21 season is fully planned and features works by Rimsky-Korsakov, Beethoven, Rossini, Gounod and more, we are still adjusting our concert dates in light of COVID-19 pandemic. Please be assured, the full season will be announced soon.  
Season Subscriptions are already available for purchase now and at early-bird rates (until May 31) - please visit our website for details, or email admin@peisymphony.com.
Donations of any size are always accepted on the Support Us page on our website.

indeed the story of how itâ€™s been created and where it comes from will reach a
wider audience around the world. It will draw attention back to Cambodia and to
the plight of the rural poor and enable us to spend more time in Cambodia,
performing and working in such communities and enable us to share this
experience through concerts, workshops and to contribute to supporting and
teaching others. The activities through releasing and touring a new Cambodian
Space Project album will generate experience and income and allow us to
re-invest this back into the emerging Cambodian music community. This enables
Channthy and The CSP to continue working free of charge in schools, orphanages,
public forums in poor and underprivileged communities in Cambodia and other
parts of the world.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

<p>This summer we're planning a south eastern US tour, all the way from Florida to Indiana!  In order to make it happen we need your help.  Being a car-less, we gotta raise some $$ to rent a cargo van so the whole band can come!</p>
<p>If you donate to our tour, we promise your contribution will go directly into the tour transportation fund and not to our student loans, child support, alimony or rare cassette collection.</p>
<p>We also offer perks like if you donate $15 or more we'll send you our latest album, The Cypress Hunt or a Dirty Fist! hand screen printed t-shirt or patch.</p>

<h3>What is allEars?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>allEars is a festival for improvised music. It was started in 2002 by Lasse Marhaug, Maja Ratkje and Paal Nilssen-Love, but is now run by bass players Guro Skumsnes Moe and Christian Meaas Svendsen. The festival has always been booked by traveling musicians, ensuring that the music presented is always collected fresh from all corners of the world, and never booked for any other purpose than the music itself.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511600709/clpd1g8otzb2csfhqsoo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Guro and Christian. Photo credit: Peter Gannushkin</i></p>
<p>This campaign aims at making allEars 2018 an unforgettable experience for both audience and artists. The festival has a small budget, but we want to be able to pay our artists decent fees. All too often creative artists end up playing for little money under poor conditions. These artists are people who are devoting their life to music, not only their own creative output, but to the journey that music is. These artists are making a huge effort in creating sustainable communities in their respective cities. They are always helpful and supportive to traveling musicians, and they deserve nothing less than to be treated with the same hospitality and of course get paid for what they do.</p>
<p>By supporting us you help us create a festival which is sustainable for the local community in Oslo. You make sure that the artists are sufficiently paid and that they are treated in the best way. This in turn gives the audience the best musical performances. You also help us taking bigger risks in choosing venues and a sense of security for next year's endeavour.</p>

<h3>What happens to all that money?</h3>
<p>Your money will go to cover all the different expenses that we have to deal with: travels, accommodation, food, back-line, venue hiring, merch-production, promotion, ticketing + more. The artists get an equal fee for their performance (Norway-residing artists get a little less), their travel expenses are covered and they get at least two nights of accommodation. The organizers of the festival are not in it for the money, and will not take any of your contributions. Any surplus will go directly to cover expenses for future events. That's a promise!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Politics, philosophy and that type of stuff...</h3>
<p>We live in a challenging time. A time where independent music and arts are increasingly devalued against an all-consuming economical capital.  It is a time when artists need to question and give an answer to the true value and importance of culture. This is an ongoing fight which allEars is very much a part of. At the same time we believe that art is not so important if not everyone is included to participate. For way too long this music has been reserved for a rather small homogenous group of people. It's not like we are trying to force this music on anyone, but we believe that everyone can find this music and the energy surrounding it joyful and meaningful. By bringing different people from all over the world together, we contribute in crossing all sorts of geographical, social and demographical barriers. That is a real and ever-so-important contribution to society: bringing people of different class, age, sex etc. together for mutual experiences. This is as an aspect of sustainability in the arts the way we see it.</p>
<p><strong>$€£</strong><br/>Another important aspect of sustainability is money. We need to stop relying too much on government funding. We don't think it is evil or anything like that. In fact we are very thankful for all the contributions the festival have gotten so far. Turning towards crowd-funding might seem like no better at first glanse, but there is an important difference: through crowd-funding the public is already engaging themselves in the festival. They invest directly in the community we want to build. Also, as a backer, you get something in return. It can be a T-shirt, a gift package with LPs or CDs or even a private house concert with one of the festival's organizers. And of course you get a fantastic festival with superb musicians and outstanding live acts. We want you to know that wether we get money from the government, the public or from private sponsors we will never compromise on the autonomy of music. That is our stamp of approval!</p>
<p><strong>Let's talk about...</strong><br/>We think music is important. In order for everyone to understand how important music is, we need to build a better vocabulary. That's why we will arrange for some debates and discussions for this year's festival. Keywords are sustainability, necessity, community.  We invite artists, the public, and some fancy names to talk about various themes within these topics. </p>

<h3>Debut Album </h3>
<p>""Josie Duncan and Pablo Lafuente are rising stars of the Scottish folk scene. I saw their show at Celtic Connections last year and booked them that night."" - David Foley, Folklub</p>
<p>We have been performing, practising and collecting for over a year now and hope to showcase this to the audience that we have reached over this time as well as to brand new audiences. To help fund the process you can pre-order the album itself, or you can look through our numerous other rewards! </p>
<p>What we want to express on our album</p>
<ul>
<li>A modern take on traditional material including Gaelic, Scots and American songs.</li>
<li>A versatile, accessible and complimentary approach to traditional song.</li>
<li>Never before heard self-penned songs. </li>
</ul>
<p>We want to give a really well rounded taster of who we are and what we do. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do we need to pay for? </h3>
<p>There are many costs involved in creating a new work like this, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Studio costs £3.2K</strong><br/>The largest cost involved in making this album is the studio costs involved. We hope to record the 10 track album with Scott Wood at Oak Ridge Studios, which we are extremely excited about.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mastering £300</strong><br/>We want our album mastered to the highest standard to ensure that we're delivering the best work we can. That's why we're delivering these tracks from one master to another. Mattie Foulds will be mastering the album. The combination of his musical mind as well as Scotts will create something really special. </li>
<li>
<strong>Musician fees (excluding ourselves) £900</strong><br/>At Celtic Connections 2016, we joined forces and became a duo. One year later at Celtic Connections 2017, we connected with our new extended line up. Robbie Greig on fiddle, Graham Rorie on mandolin, Rufus Huggan on cello, Conal McDonagh on pipes and whistles and David Foley on percussion. As well as having tracks that only feature the two of us, we want to record with a mix of these musicians across the album including one full band track. These musicians are worth their weight in gold and we're so happy that they're on board to work with us! As well as this, Colin Macleod will be joining us for one song. Colin Produced Josie's first ever recording and we have both been long-time fans of his music. </li>
<li>
<strong>Printing £600</strong><br/>Printing the album is as straightforward as it sounds but one of the most crucial elements. We can't wait to have our first big box of CD's arrive and to post them out to those of you that have pre-ordered them on this campaign!</li>
<li>
<strong>Online Distribution £70</strong><br/>We will make the album available worldwide on multiple online music platforms including itunes, spotify, google play and amazon. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>As you can see, this adds up to more than our crowdfunding target and the fees from upcoming gigs will also be going towards production and promotional costs. We will also be self-funding our promotional video and album launch, which you can buy tickets to as part of our 'VIP Packages'. </p>
<h3>Why do we want to make an album? </h3>
<p>Being able to create this album would truly open up a new door for us. Over our time as a duo we have been collecting songs and arranging original material. An album is an ideal platform to showcase yourself as an artist. Here is what we hope to achieve :</p>
<ul>
<li>To showcase ourselves and our versatile approach to song.</li>
<li>To 'launch' ourselves onto the traditional music scene, which we feel so warmly welcomed into.</li>
<li>To develop new skills as a duo and as individual young musicians entering the profession.</li>
<li>To create something brand new.</li>
<li>To reach new audiences.</li>
<li>To have the opportunity to collaborate, work with and learn from industry professionals with a wealth of experience. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We recognise that this is a big ask and we can't express enough how much we appreciate all of your support. With out the funding we would not be able cover the costs mentioned above. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>If we do not raise enough funds, your money will be fully refunded and unfortunately in this case we will not be able to send out the rewards. </span></p>

<p>My name is Ingrid Plum, I've been singing since before I can remember. Last year, thanks to amazing crowdfunders, I got to study with Meredith Monk. She inspired me to start this new project called Taut.</p>
<p>This campaign is a pre-order for Taut. Meredith Monk spoke with me about writing music as a score and the role of the singer. It led me to explore this myself and I asked some incredible artists to compose scores, using whatever form they want, which I will interpret and perform. </p>
<p>This project is taking things to another level for me, I've asked the composers to challenge me with their scores and I'm so excited to bring you these new works by these wonderful artists: Graham Dunning, Aine O'Dwyer, Iris Garrelfs, Jez Riley French, Bobby Barry, Lisa Busby, Lia Mazzari, Blanca Regina, Kev Nickells, Helen Frosi, Stephan Barrett, Nick Hudson.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Pre-order Taut</h3>
<ul>
<li>You can pre-order the book containing prints of the scores and a download of Taut performed and recorded at Iklectik. You can also get a thank you in the book! Or just order the album.</li>
<li>I need to raise £500 to be able to access Arts Council Funding I have applied for to then get the album rehearsed, recorded and manufactured.</li>
<li>If I don't reach my goal funds will be used to help get Taut happening at a more distant time in the future. I've been working on this project for nearly a year so fingers crossed!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>If you pre-order Taut you're literally making it happen.</h3>
<h3>Funds from this campaign will prove to the arts council there is an audience for the project and will cover the printing costs of the book. </h3>
<ul>
<li>Taut is breaking open the classical traditional model of composition and performance to bring you these new works by early to mid career artists. At the same time I'm taking my practice as a performer to a new level.</li>
<li>In 2016 I was so lucky that crowdfunders sent me to study with Meredith Monk. I told her this and she asked me to thank everyone for sending me over. This project is the next step, building on that experience.</li>
<li>The whole project will cost £7,000 so this is the first part of the puzzle to get in place. Once this falls into place through amazing people (with great taste) pre-ordering Taut, the whole project can get going with other funding!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>The risk I face in this project is proving there are people interested in Taut, that there is an audience out there for new composition. So, if you're interested in these types of projects being made please show your support. Without this crowdfunding, the entire project won't happen.</p>
<p>I've been very lucky before, and I think that is because I never ask for charity. I offer an exchange and I'm realistic about what people can afford. </p>

The risk I face in this project is proving there are people interested in Taut, that there is an audience out there for new composition. So, if you're interested in these types of projects being made please show your support. Without this crowdfunding, the entire project won't happen.
I've been very lucky before, and I think that is because I never ask for charity. I offer an exchange and I'm realistic about what people can afford.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Lisa Sanders is ready to make the leap of faith and take her music to the masses.  Lisa has six full length CD's to her credit and has worked with some of the most talented, singers, songwriters, musicians and producers in the business.  She has made music her full time career and is traveling, performing, meeting new contacts and working on a new CD.  Lisa has put together one of the best bands around.  She also has a great management team and new products...where you come in:  ALL OF THIS COSTS MONEY<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>This campaign is a great way to help Lisa and her music continue moving forward.  As many of you know, it is extremely difficult to be a full time independent musician.  Even when you are extremely talented like Lisa, if you are not made of money, the costs of every day life, gas, and just having money to make cd's to sell can be overwhelming.  Lisa is now taking her music on the road, which is what she has to do to move forward outside of Southern California. Her airfare, hotels, rental cars, food and things that come up along the way have to be paid for.  Lisa has paid her dues here but in Nashville and other large venues, she is just making a name for herself.<br/><br/>When you participate in this campaign by purchasing an advance copy of Lisa's upcoming CD or one of the other amazing packages she has put together, you will be helping Lisa reach a broader audience, get her music on the road and hopefully the radio.  As well help her afford those that support her in getting her music out to the world.  <br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We need to raise as much money as soon as possible for Lisa's upcoming trip to New York to meet some big time producers as well as fly back to Nashville to meet again with some other major players and play some great places like the Nashville Ear where she has been one of the few that has been invited to play.<br/><br/>Lisa will be using this money to produce her next CD as well as to get to and from these very important meetings coming up.  We are inviting you participate in this campaign with us and become a partner in this journey along the way with Lisa.  Lisa cannot do this without you.<br/><br/>You can donate as little or as much as you like.  $20 get's you a signed Advance Copy of Lisa's New CD Release.  $25 Gets You a signed Advanced Copy of the CD as well as one of Lisa's New Gorgeous signed photographs.  $50.00 will get you the signed Advanced copy of her Upcoming CD as well as her newest Shiver Tour T-shirt which is super sharp.    Donate $100 and Get the ""Shiver"" Package which Includes the Advanced Copy of Lisa's CD, A Shiver Shirt, Hat and Poster.  We also have a Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum package for $250, $500, $1000 and $2500.<br/><br/>Time is of the essence for Lisa on this.  This campaign will in and of itself cost Lisa money.  If she does not make her goal, the company will take as much as 12% of any money she collects.  All contributors will receive advanced breaking news!<br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>We REALLY REALLY Need your help to get the word out about this campaign.  Send it via email, facebook, myspace, reverbnation, phone or any other way you know how to friends and family.  Anyone who loves music, knows Lisa, is looking for a great way to help another or just loves independent musicians.  We so appreciate all you do and Lisa knows that she cannot make this journey without you, her family, friends and fans!<br/><br/>

<h3>What is Abandoned Tracks?</h3>
<p>Abandoned Tracks is a documentary that looks at the unused railway tunnels and tracks that are in Australia. </p>
<p>Originally, it was an idea to be a 3 part documentary web-series I was wanted to do at University in 2016.  I did one of the 3 episodes last year, which looked at the Helensburgh tunnels on the South Coast of Australia. These Helensburgh tunnels are located approximately halfway between Sydney and Wollongong. </p>
<p>This documentary is looking at the St James and Central Stations and their unused tracks as well as their history. </p>
<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>Caitlin Monaghan</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm currently studying my Advanced Diploma of Screen and Media at TAFE</li>
<li>I recently finished my Bachelor of Communication majoring in Media Arts Production</li>
<li>I've done a similar documentary on the Helensburgh Tunnels (between Sydney and Wollongong)</li>
<li>I've really gotten into documentaries in the last couple of years and while they are hard work, I do enjoy them.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What We Need:</strong></h2>
</div><div><ul>
<li>I'm aiming for $2000, as $1720(about 430 p/hour and having someone to keep an eye on the crew while we're in the tunnels) will go towards getting access to the tunnels at Central and St James for a 4hour period. </li>
<li>As a student, I can't do huge perks but depending on how much you donate will weather you get a thanks in the credits or a link to the project (as well as a credit).</li>
<li>If the goal isn't reached, that's okay, something will get worked out.</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The support for the campaign will showcase that there is interest in documentaries showcasing the unused tracks and tunnels that are all over Australia. Having previously done a documentary of the<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aziUGkDATmM"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Helensburgh Tunnels</a>, there are people who interested and there are stories surrounding these tunnels that people don't really know about.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Even if the funding isn't raised completely and I can't get access to the tunnels, the money will probably go into getting decent quality historical photographs of both stations and the tunnels that lay unused.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>As a student, we understand very well that money can be tight. But thankfully there is always a way to help without leaving you broke. </p>

We love Jesus and the freedom He gives.
We are raising funds to cover the cost of our new EP ""Light for Dark Places"". It is finished, and it sounds awesome.

<h3>We are poor kids with expensive dreams.  </h3>

Oh so grateful.  We will find you on our 6 week All-American adventure and thank/hug you personally.  Most of the people at our shows don't come off as rich, so don't feel obligated whatsoever to give us any money you need for your own living routine.  We don't want to feel like dicks for putting your lunch money into our gas tank. You could buy Keystone instead of Budweiser next time you're on a beer run, and BAM you got a couple extra bucks for donating.</p>
<h3>Recording:</h3>

<p>Doug: Bass Guitar(Beard of the Year candidate)</p>
<p>Austin: Drum set</p>
<p>Our band has been together for almost a year now, and we want to have something to show for it. We have been in and out of local recording studios, even singing in Nelson's closet. We believe our fans deserve a EP of professional quality  and we have a chance to work with a producer that has worked with Kings of Leon and who believes our band is worth investing in. He is giving us a lower price to help out on a financial level because he is a personal fan of our work. We don't want to miss this opportunity to take our a band to the next level.</p>
<p>With your contributions, we hope to record a 4 to 5 song EP completely mastered. We feel our outreach will be strengthen by a professional EP and our message can spread throughout the inter-webs:</p>
<p>""Above all else, be true to yourself""</p>

<p>We have been through a vocalist, a violin player, and three guitarists in the past year.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Godstopper</span> are a Toronto-based group taking cues from the noisy likes of Melvins, Gandharvas, Today is the Day, Unsane, Torche, YOB, Khanate, and more. Formed in 2010 by Mike Simpson in an attempt to create something in line with the heavy 
post-metal that Toronto has lately fostered but to also go beyond the 
typical limitations of metal and hardcore. With a sound complex and thick 
with influences ranging from 90s alternative to doom to sludge to 
shoegaze and noise, the band's motives are as difficult to pin down as 
its sound. <br/></p>

<h3>I. The Video<br/>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The video for <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Everybody Writes Good Songs</span> intends to draw heavily on the aesthetic of documentary films and blur the line between reality and fiction to create a unique and unconventional music video. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Clean House</span> explored the homestead of its characters with a gritty, voyeuristic lens and the use of available lighting (candles, car headlights, lamps). <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Everybody Writes Good Songs</span> will build upon this and introduce a documentary crew recording gritty scenes of peregrine captives and authorities through an institution and into the forest. We believe we'll have a video as bleak and crushing (yet eerily melodic) as the track.<br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After completing a new music video for Finland's new forest-folk supergroup <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Hexvessel</span>, Justin Oakey was recently interviewed by LURKER to discuss independent filmmaking, underground music, and where both converge.

<h3>II. Donations</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our previous video<span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span> was created entirely out of favours and pocket change. For this next video, we're looking to get <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">$500</span> to cover the costs of costumes, props, transport to locations, and feeding those who will be helping us out. It's a very small sum for this kind of production, meaning it is a bare minimum to cover the costs - no individual will gain a cent from this. We're looking to make something bizarre, unconventional, and ultimately interesting, not to make money. As extra incentive, there are some ""perks"" listed for the first donors to claim them - including unreleased material, the remaining copies of the EP on cassette, and t-shirts, as well as being mentioned in the upcoming album's liner notes.</p>

The original pitch and updates are listed below.



Godstopper are a Toronto-based group taking cues from the noisy likes of Melvins, Gandharvas, Today is the Day, Unsane, Torche, YOB, Khanate, and more. Formed in 2010 by Mike Simpson in an attempt to create something in line with the heavy 
post-metal that Toronto has lately fostered but to also go beyond the 
typical limitations of metal and hardcore. With a sound complex and thick 
with influences ranging from 90s alternative to doom to sludge to 
shoegaze and noise, the band's motives are as difficult to pin down as 
its sound. 

Some positive words about Godstopper:

via METAL SUCKS (USA)
via TERRORIZER (UK)
via LURKER (UK)
via SHINY GREY MONOTONE (UK)
via PORCYS (Poland)
via Aaron Turner (of Isis, USA)
via Andrew Nolan (of The Endless Blockade and Slaughter Strike, Canada)

The EP is available for listening and download on BANDCAMP.


Production Stills (UPDATE 2012-02-21)








I. The Video

The video for Everybody Writes Good Songs intends to draw heavily on the aesthetic of documentary films and blur the line between reality and fiction to create a unique and unconventional music video. Clean House explored the homestead of its characters with a gritty, voyeuristic lens and the use of available lighting (candles, car headlights, lamps). Everybody Writes Good Songs will build upon this and introduce a documentary crew recording gritty scenes of peregrine captives and authorities through an institution and into the forest. We believe we'll have a video as bleak and crushing (yet eerily melodic) as the track.

Click and watch Clean House (2011) via Godstopper & Justin Oakey

After completing a new music video for Finland's new forest-folk supergroup Hexvessel, Justin Oakey was recently interviewed by LURKER to discuss independent filmmaking, underground music, and where both converge. The interview can be read here: The Lost Art of the Music Video.

II. Donations
Our previous video was created entirely out of favours and pocket change. For this next video, we're looking to get $500 to cover the costs of costumes, props, transport to locations, and feeding those who will be helping us out. It's a very small sum for this kind of production, meaning it is a bare minimum to cover the costs - no individual will gain a cent from this. We're looking to make something bizarre, unconventional, and ultimately interesting, not to make money. As extra incentive, there are some ""perks"" listed for the first donors to claim them - including unreleased material, the remaining copies of the EP on cassette, and t-shirts, as well as being mentioned in the upcoming album's liner notes.

If you want to support Godstopper or underground and independent art, please post this campaign to your social networking websites and help us out.",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p class=""p1""><b>Our Story</b></p>
<p class=""p1"">A grassroots non-profit, The Chad Foundation for Athletes and Artists provides heart screenings to young athletes and students. The organization was formed in honor of son, brother and friend, Chad Burtrum, who, at 26, died of Sudden Cardiac Arrest. Gregarious, kind and spirited, Chad was a healthy, strong man with no prior history of heart disease. </p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">The Chad Foundation works to prevent such sudden, tragic deaths from occurring through early detection and prevention. Heart screenings can detect early risk factors for heart diseases such as hypertension, high cholesterol, obesity and diabetes, and may prevent Sudden Cardiac Death. To date, the organization has provided near 6,000 heart screenings to high school and college students and the disenfranchised in five states and Austria and Sweden. We were the very first organization to provide echocardiogram screenings to high school students in North Hollywood, CA. We are fortunate to have some of the best hospitals in the country support our program: Childrenâ€™s Hospital Los Angeles, Johns Hopkins and NYU.</p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">We also create art, through books, film and theatre, that articulates our motto ""Healthy Body, Mind and Spirit."" The Chad Players have performed six Off-Broadway performances, including one special performance for three hundred New York City homeless men and women. Our third production of ""Days of Wine and Roses"" was brought to Atlantic City as the community event of the year. The play highlights the deleterious effects of substance abuse on the family.</p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">We invite you to join us in protecting young hearts and their futures as we strive to expand our program to other states.</p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1""><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p class=""p1"">When Chad Foundation began its work, awareness of HCM (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an abnormally enlarged heart muscle) was extremely low. At the time, it was believed only 11 or 12 young people died annually from Sudden Cardiac Arrest. The CDC now reports that 5,000 people between 15 and 34 years of age die from this ""silent killer."" Considered the gold standard, the echocardiogram screens for structural abnormalities and the EKG detects electrical anomalies, yet these are not standard in youth prescreening medical exams and are not normally covered by insurance companies. </p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">In countries like Italy, screenings have been mandatory for the past 25 years with a 94% save rate. Our program has found a 10% rate of heart anomalies for every 100 people screened. We strive to raise awareness of Sudden Cardiac Death in the young in all 50 states, teach others about the warning signs and the importance of preventive screenings as the best way to detect lethal heart abnormalities and prevent early heart disease. Our goal is to provide at least one screening in every state, which communities can replicate, with the ultimate goal of mandatory heart screenings for all our US athletes.</p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1""><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p class=""p1"">Chad Foundation needs donations that empower us to expand our heart-screening program state by state. Parents, athletic trainers, athletes, artists and health professionals support our work. There are no paid salaries in our organization; every dollar raised goes toward operational costs of our preventive screening program.</p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">We plan to provide heart screenings in 5 states, MA, CT, MI, CA and NY. If we exceed our goal, we will be able to provide screenings to other states that have never had heart screening programs for their youth. Even if we do not meet our goal, we will complete as many screenings as possible!</p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">Your gifts, large or small, allow us to organize screenings for youth, travel to their communities, provide supplies and personnel. In return, you will have the greatest gratitude of every parent and family member with a child who has benefited from our program, and you will have helped protect a child's future.</p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1"">We are working on a book and screenplay on the foundation's journey, and in the future we may be able to offer discounts or passes in appreciation of your Gifts--stay tuned!</p>
<p class=""p2""><br/></p>
<p class=""p1""><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p class=""p1"">Firstly, raise your, your family's and friends' awareness of Sudden Cardiac Death in young people, its causes, warning signs (fainting, blackouts, dizziness, especially related to physical activity, is NOT NORMAL for teens).

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>Two danish musicians with an idea and a website that has been in development for a year.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The idea</strong></h2>
<p>Once in a while you discover some amazing music, and then you realize that the band is from half around the world. Why should the venues and bookers dare to book this?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>More concerts</h3>
<p>If we create a centralized and dedicated web service where everyone can show venues what they want to see in concert, how much they would pay for the tickets, and how far they want to travel to attend the concert. The bookers and venues will then know that there is a fanbase, and then they are able to see if it will be profitable. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Don't miss the sale!</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">If a venue decides to book a concert, the users who meet the venues' requirements to price and location/distance will get invited to buy concert tickets by email. We will try to make sure that the users of Cravegig have ticket reservations for a period of time.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Upcoming and local bands... More gigs for you!</h3>
<p>All bands and artists can sign up, free of course. By asking your fans and friends to ""crave a concert"" with you at Cravegig, you can prove to the venues, bookers and cafés in your area, that you have a fanbase. This means that they probably won't loose money if they book you.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Better economy for the venues and bookers!</h3>
<p>This has some expenses... Hosting the website, development, administration and promotion. The venues pay a tiny fee for each ticket sold through Cravegig, but this expense should be lower than what they would normally have been using to promote the concert.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What we have now</h2>
<p>We have been spending the past half year on developing the website which finished yesterday. We are not experts, but we think it's a good start. But we faced a problem - server capacity, which basically means that the server is too slow.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>At the moment the website is way to slow. Another issue is, that for this concept to work, we need to attract a lot of users through advertisement.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>To cover server expenses and optimization of the website</h3>
</li>
<li>
<h3>To cover expenses to advertisement, primarily on social and music websites.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p>How much we need for these expenses depends on how many users we will get and how fast. Our estimate is $500 to cover website optimization, $1000 to cover server upgrade the first year and the rest to kickstart the advertisement campaign. The more we get for advertisement the better chances for the concept to prove its worth.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>The whole purpose of Cravegig is to generate more concerts to all of us. We dream that this service soon will become something your inner music lover could not live without. The service will be free to use for ordinary users and bands. We don't have any nice gadgets to offer, but take a look at the perks. It might be a good investment.</p>

</div><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Hi everyone,</span><br/></p><div>
<p></p>
<p>So I have set myself the MAHOOSIVE challenge of organising a charity concert in October 2015! It's going to be called 'The Sisterhood Concert' and true to its name it's going to be a one night celebration of all things female, starring all women performers: Singers, Dancers, Comediennes &amp; Public Speakers. As well as being an awesome night of music, laughter and story telling, it's also to raise money and awareness for the great work that the charity ""Women's Aid""  do to  help women and their children who are fleeing domestic violence!</p>
<p>I will be honest and say that my budget for this concert is very VERY minimal and I'm doing this all out of my own pocket, with a touch of creative accounting and imagination lol! The plan is to get as much sponsored for free by the events suppliers, but I'm having a real struggle convincing a venue to sponsor the venue hire cost for free, so this is where my back up plan comes in... YOU lol! That's right, I need your help to raise £3,000 to cover the cost of the venue hire, because if I don't have a venue, then I don't have a concert to hold!.</p>
<p>Now your probably wondering why you should put your hands in your purses and wallets for some woman who decided one day to just go and organise a concert and with no budget either! well let me tell you my ""WHY"" behind this concert:</p>
<p>For me it's two fold, firstly I have a personal connection to the 'Women's Aid'; a few years ago they helped me out of a really really bad situation, they got me rehoused and my life back on track and I am eternally grateful to them for all the support and help they gave me  during those dark times and I have been looking for the right way to say thank you to them ever since; so when I came up with this concert idea, it just seemed the perfect way to give back! </p>
<p>The second part is personal to me and my journey in life, like a lot of people I came to understand the pains and stresses of life quite young in my childhood, there was a lot of family strife during my childhood years, mainly involving my mother who was unfortunately an alcoholic. Now I'm not here to tell you a sob story or to demonise my family and mother, I love them all dearly and in no way blame or use them as an opportunity for sympathy here, I simply tell you this to you give you a insight into my journey so far.  I have since learnt that in life, what at the time can feel like a curse often turns out to be your blessing in you life. what my childhood showed me was that I wasn't alone in feeling like I wasn't good enough and that putting on a ""happy front"" is so common for so many people, but more specifically women, having made some of my own serious mistakes and facing them by getting help and talking to people I've come to realise that there are so many women who need help! and as a result of my own personal journey I've become a bit of a female empowerment warrior - which is where my concert comes in! </p>
<p>whilst I definitely want it to be a awesome night of entertainment for the audience, more importantly to me I want it to touch the hearts, minds and spirits of all those women who feel uninspired, hopeless and just not happy with themselves or their lives; I  want women to know they are NOT alone and that together as a sisterhood we can face anything together, by breaking the silence and talking about our fears, pains and demons. I want this concert to represent hope, strength and love that women should have for themselves, their daughters, sisters, cousins and our fellow women.</p>
<p>So that's it, I know a very long winded explanation of why I need your help, but your help I do need! without a venue I cannot hold my concert which I KNOW and BELIEVE is going to be more that just a great night, it's going to be the start of a movement, THE SISTERHOOD MOVEMENT!</p>
<p>Thank you for taking the time to consider my campaign and any donations you are able to give will be greatly appreciated and if you can't afford to donate, please take a quick moment to share my campaign with friends and family!</p>
<p>have a beautiful day and god bless.</p>
