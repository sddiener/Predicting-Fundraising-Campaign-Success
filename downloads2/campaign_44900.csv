<p>Do you love vintage? Have you ever walked into a vintage store hoping to find that timeless retro look in your size and in perfect condition, only to be disappointed? Are you tired of contemporary shapeless and casual looks that flood todays market? Do you want to dress and feel like a lady in <em>wearable</em> clothing? Then let me introduce you to <strong>RECOLLECTION</strong>.</p>

<p>A couple of years ago, having worked as a designer in New York's fashion industry for over a decade, I was fed up. Fed up with come-and-go trends, disposable clothing and my jam-packed closet that didn't excite me. However, I still loved fashion and particularly vintage fashion. Good vintage was getting harder to find and due to how fragile it is, I seldom wore the pieces I had. I checked out some vintage reproduction labels but their style felt too costume for me and the quality was poor. I wanted high quality designer vintage style in new condition and modern fit. This was something missing in today's market and seeing as I was a designer I thought, hey, why not start my own independent label!</p>
<p>I named my label <strong>RECOLLECTION</strong> which so far has seen a lot of success with press and in local stores in New York. I regularly get emails from women all around the world seeking my designs after discovering them in one of the many blogs it's been featured on. Last year I was a successful finalist in <em>Design Entrepreneurs NYC</em>, a mini MBA program offered to a select group of New York City-based designers. This gave me the business tools I needed to understand how to take the next step and launch an online store making <strong>RECOLLECTION</strong> globally available, wherever you are.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/765/764/3841ed0295959646e441bf1cbfa13a0a_large.jpg?1374469246"" src="""" style=""""/><em><br/></em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 120px;""><em>Fall 2013 collection preview. Rose Callahan p<em>hotography</em>.</em></p>
<p>I've created this project to help raise the funds needed to launch the online store. I've been working very hard on the new Fall 2013 collection as well as gathering a special selection of vintage accessories to compliment it, which will also be available through the store. Production is underway in New York's garment district and now I need to prepare the website for sales. Some of the additional expenses to start an online store include:  </p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Web development costs for design, E-commerce hosting, etc.</li>
<li>Photo shoot expenses such as photography, model fees, etc.</li>
<li>Inventory management &amp; storage</li>
<li>Start-up packaging &amp; shipping supplies</li>
<li>Marketing &amp; promotion costs</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you would like to help make the <strong>RECOLLECTION</strong> online store a reality, I would be truly grateful for the support. Your generosity will not only be appreciated but rewarded. Perks begin at $10 and every pledge, no matter the amount, can help me reach my goal of $8,000. It's all-or-nothing with this project and to be successfully funded I have to reach my goal. If I am not only successful but surpass my goal, the additional funding will be used to grow my business. Short-term this means attending tradeshows (average cost $10,000 p/season) to meet new store buyers and expand my distribution outside of New York. Long-term this means developing <strong>RECOLLECTION </strong>as a lifestyle brand expanding my product categories to include: swimwear, lingerie, shoes, handbags, and jewelry. </p>

<p><em>Our team - a group of Masters students with interests in fashion and technology.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>Upon graduating, we all want to work in luxury or fashion. We came up with the idea of the fashion show as a way to showcase our skills. This simple idea developed as we thought about how many other students throughout the UK and the world find it hard to show future employers what they can do.</p>
<p>How do we overcome that 'Catch 22' of needing more experience when its not easy to be hired? We develop our own event and show off our skills while supporting other students to do the same.</p>
<p>This fashion show will be for students and by students. From the designers to the makeup artists, hair stylists and event managers. It will include student input in every area possible.</p>
<p>Our goal is to produce a show that generates publicity for the designers and a truly successful event for all those involved to use in their job searches.</p>

<h2>What is iFashion London?</h2>
<p>iFashion London is a fashion show for students by students with a social media edge. As Gen Y's, we are digital natives. Our future buying power is in the billions. And we engage daily with brands online. We know how to do this, and we want to show the world what we can do.</p>
<p>The show will be open to all current and recent alumni at any London school that focuses on fashion design. <strong>We currently have 10 designers on board from schools such as the London College of Fashion, American Intercontinental University and Brighton. We're so excited to be supporting these students!</strong>W</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will organise the show, involving students in every part that we can. We want you to be a part of the online community we are creating in order to make this show as social as possible. We'll be organising a few little social competitions and opportunities online. We want you to be as engaged as we are!</p>
<p><strong>Recently, we've added companies such as Electric Hair and Greasepaint to help the makeup and hair students who will be taking part. We couldn't do this without their support and are very grateful!</strong></p>
<p><strong>iFashion London is set to take place on July 10</strong> and will travel out to our online community through social media. We'll be asking you to vote on the designs and the winner of the people's choice award will be awarded the inaugural iFashion London Show award!</p>

Oyster Card. The practical, fast, fun, discrete and new way to pay for your
commute. You can also instantly display your Oyster Card balance on your O-Band
365.</p>
<p>The O-band 365</p>
<p>This is a unisex product for the London commuters and
soon also the contactless payers...</p>
<p><b><u>The purpose:</u></b></p>
<p>You will never have to find your credit card sized TFL
Oyster Card again. You can instantly display your Oyster balance on your wrist.</p>
<p>Simply ""pair n place"" this band around your
wrist and touch in and out of any station or bus that accepts Oyster Card. Pair
once and use just like a normal Oyster Card but with the added benefit of
instantly knowing your Oyster balance - a one touch display will give you your
Oyster balance on demand. Avoid queues and always know your balance.</p>
<p>The O-band 365 will revolutionise the way you travel,
making it quick and simple to get to where you need to be. Never be the one who
creates a bottle neck queue at the front of a barrier or bus trying to find
your Oyster Card or not knowing your Oyster balance. </p>
<p>Comfortable on your wrist, the O-band 365 can fit snuggly
under your watch or bracelet. The design itself is attractive to be a bracelet
in itself.</p>
<p>Simple, discrete, quick and easy - welcome to the O-band
365.</p>
<p><b><u>The use:</u></b></p>
<p>""Pair and place"" on your wrist and use just
like you would your Oyster Card. View you Oyster balance at the touch of a

<br/></div>","The O-band 365 is the first and only 'on your wrist'
Oyster Card. The practical, fast, fun, discrete and new way to pay for your
commute. You can also instantly display your Oyster Card balance on your O-Band
365.
The O-band 365
This is a unisex product for the London commuters and
soon also the contactless payers...
The purpose:
You will never have to find your credit card sized TFL
Oyster Card again. You can instantly display your Oyster balance on your wrist.
Simply ""pair n place"" this band around your
wrist and touch in and out of any station or bus that accepts Oyster Card. Pair
once and use just like a normal Oyster Card but with the added benefit of
instantly knowing your Oyster balance - a one touch display will give you your
Oyster balance on demand. Avoid queues and always know your balance.
The O-band 365 will revolutionise the way you travel,
making it quick and simple to get to where you need to be. Never be the one who
creates a bottle neck queue at the front of a barrier or bus trying to find
your Oyster Card or not knowing your Oyster balance. 
Comfortable on your wrist, the O-band 365 can fit snuggly
under your watch or bracelet. The design itself is attractive to be a bracelet
in itself.
Simple, discrete, quick and easy - welcome to the O-band
365.
The use:
""Pair and place"" on your wrist and use just
like you would your Oyster Card. View you Oyster balance at the touch of a
button.
Top up, touch in, touch out, capped fares...all the same.
With the O-band 365 you will not get caught out by card-clash.
The technology:
Using the latest Radio-Frequency identification (RFID)
chip and Bluetooth technology we have perfected a quick and easy way to pair
your current Oyster Card or Contactless payment card to the O-band 365.
Simply pair once and you are good to go.
Rewards:
If we can get the full funding you will have delivered in
October 2014 the first batch bands in the following quantities:
£25 funding = 1 O-band 365 (rrp £34.95)
£50 funding = 2 O-band 365s (rrp £69.90)

<p>We are focused on the high quality of the final product.And we need to refine the product before launching it to the market.Since we plan to launch our own production, our calculations indicate that we need 250 thousand dollars for that.</p>
<p>Any amount collected above that will give us an opportunity to surprise the fans of our product with even more colorful Cyclops caps!</p>
<p></p>
<p>For example,
if we collect five hundred thousand we could develop an
exclusive collection of Cyclops with elegant and top - quality materials.</p>
<p>And it will also bring us closer to our plan to launch our basic concept of Cyclops with a flexible screen.</p>
<p>The technology of flexible displays is currently at an early stage of development across the world.In addition to numerous complexities associated with it,it also requires a lot of funding.Therefore, as soon as the amount of one million dollars is collected we will be ready at last to release a completely unique Cyclops line,which will undoubtedly be loved by everyone, so elegant,always ready to turn into a regular snapback,but with a very unusual design.Cyclops with a flexible screen, “Cyclops flex”.</p>

<p>Frequently asked questions.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>How much did the weight of a cap increase with a case and a screen?</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>The mean weight of a cap is around  100 gramms. The screen added additional 56 gramms to the total weight. Yet we are still working on it!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What is the screen’s resolution?</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We use screens with 960x640 resolution (326 pixels per inch), 3.5″ diagonal, which allows to have a bright image even during the day time!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Is the device water resistant? it is important!</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We have thought this through at the early stages of Cyclops creation. The case is sealed and does not let water inside. Charging port is also protected by a plug. Cyclops is totally protected!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Is there any radiation emission from this product? is there any harm to the body?</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our team took this question seriously. We have spent a lot of time and funds to medical research ( and are still working and will be working on this question). We were able to decrease harmful effects on a body, mostly by using LCD display, which does not produce radiation. Our device has much less of Specific Absorption Rates (SAR), than on mobile devices, which makes it safer than your mobile phone. There is no need to worry!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>What types of video format are supported?</strong></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>At the moment, Cyclops support MP4, MOV, M4V and AVI video formats. Yet, we are working on creation of universal Video player! We are sure that by the time of your purchase, you will not worry about such question.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>In what colors will be Cyclops available?</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>

           Cyclo-1 – is
a basic model, made of good quality cotton and superlight but strong
plastic. It has all the necessary functions to feel the product best.
Cyclo-1 is a base for all other lines of Cyclops brand, particularly
in the programme of corporate sales, that symbolizes high technical
specifications of the following model and a wide range of
possibilities













Exclusive collection – is an
exclusive line of Cyclops, made for those, who got used to possess
only the best. Exclusive collection is Cyclops made of high quality
material. Each of the caps from this line has each own combination
of styles. Exclusive collection is a Cyclops for true collectors and
aesthetics lovers.



Examples of future
models, created by Cyclops Exclusive Collection are listed below:
Cyclops Nature Line – skilfull
combination of smooth and  braided leather
underlines your style and ability to appreciate luxury. The case,
that is made from the lightest wood in the world – Balsa, with
gilded fittings makes this model a worthy exhibit of modern fashion.Cyclops Gold Line
is the “gold reserve” of our brand. Gold Line is an exclusive
line made using elements with golden hues. This model represents
glamour and beauty. High-quality materials: suede, leather, vinyl and
numerous design findings characteristic of the Gold Line will

fiber is used to manufacture the best sports cars
in the world and Formula-1 race cars. Carbon is
both light and strong,
but in addition it has
attractive texture that fans of extreme
sports and urban clothing style will love to wear.

Under standing the Cyclops device will be easy
for everyone as the novelty of  this device is the idea itself,
the idea of merging two different things.
We took the most popular headgear,
a usual snapback, and
our team of designers and engineers began
to work together to create the body.
Upon selecting the
best design, we have equipped the Cyclops with a video player especially optimized for our tasks and appearance.
Achieving
the most optimal weight of our device
was also a specific and important
criterion for us.Then
we isolated the entire device from
moisture.
*
 At the moment, we are constantly experimenting with our device, so
Cyclops specifications are subject to change. In this case, we will
notify all backers by mail. 
                    
                  

The application is
primarily designed to
control the cap
easily without removing it from
the head. It is also used to
synchronize the cap with
a smart phone or a PC.

The application
functionality includes:


Full control of the
	video player on the cap


Synchronization
	between the cap and a PC to transfer data from devices to the cap


News from the company
	(promotions, discounts, events)

Cyclops Shop (with
	gift certificates and an opportunity to order a cap through the
	application)


Mini Text Editor to display text on the cap screen. 
We
hope that this will make communication with disabled people much
easier, so we call this functionality ‘easy talk’

exclusive collection of Cyclops with elegant and top - quality materials.
And it will also bring us closer to our plan to launch our basic concept of Cyclops with a flexible screen.
The technology of flexible displays is currently at an early stage of development across the world.In addition to numerous complexities associated with it,it also requires a lot of funding.Therefore, as soon as the amount of one million dollars is collected we will be ready at last to release a completely unique Cyclops line,which will undoubtedly be loved by everyone, so elegant,always ready to turn into a regular snapback,but with a very unusual design.Cyclops with a flexible screen, “Cyclops flex”.


                                           
     






FAQ
Frequently asked questions.









How much did the weight of a cap increase with a case and a screen?



The mean weight of a cap is around  100 gramms. The screen added additional 56 gramms to the total weight. Yet we are still working on it!







What is the screen’s resolution?



We use screens with 960x640 resolution (326 pixels per inch), 3.5″ diagonal, which allows to have a bright image even during the day time!







Is the device water resistant? it is important!



We have thought this through at the early stages of Cyclops creation. The case is sealed and does not let water inside. Charging port is also protected by a plug. Cyclops is totally protected!







Is there any radiation emission from this product? is there any harm to the body?



Our team took this question seriously. We have spent a lot of time and funds to medical research ( and are still working and will be working on this question). We were able to decrease harmful effects on a body, mostly by using LCD display, which does not produce radiation. Our device has much less of Specific Absorption Rates (SAR), than on mobile devices, which makes it safer than your mobile phone. There is no need to worry!







What types of video format are supported?



At the moment, Cyclops support MP4, MOV, M4V and AVI video formats. Yet, we are working on creation of universal Video player! We are sure that by the time of your purchase, you will not worry about such question.







In what colors will be Cyclops available?



Our color palette is very rich. Currently, we have 4 lines of Cyclops, in each of them there will be different models, materials and colors.

Cyclo-1
Cyclops Gold
Cyclops carbon
Nature line

Official information will be available on our website very soon

<p><strong>The Jacket</strong> | There are many types of dog jackets but none like this! This jacket is something you only buy once, not to use a few times and throw away.

<p><br/>Sustainability is the way of the future. Sourcing the right materials and producing close to home are important, just as producing the right goods. One of the reasons for this project is also to find out which exact sizes we need to produce to avoid any waste. Perhaps the most important factor in sustainability however, is usage. It would make a huge difference if we would use the goods we have more and if we wash them less often. Using premium quality materials to create quality products that will be cared for and used and enjoyed for a long time instead of discarded.</p>

<p><strong>PARIS DELUXE</strong> | Limited, exclusive and completely over the top! From reserved stock on hand, we will create 3 stunning custom jackets, with the help of Zig Zag Borduurservice in Amsterdam. One we are shipping to Paris Hilton, the other two can be yours! Example of custom embroideries they made on our FREDDY heritage jacket:</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/467749901?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><br/>Once the campaign is finished, we will contact you and get started right away. This needs to be done and shipped before X-Mas! We start with choosing a font and design for your dog's name. Choose the color of the yarn and let us know what else you want us to add. We will show you many options for embroidery designs, patches, studs, ruffles, the sky is the limit! It hoes without saying that this package comes with a deluxe poop bags holder.</p>
<p><strong>The objective</strong> | The funding goal of € 5.000 is set to acquire a sufficient amount of Candiani denim and do a production of several hundeds of dog jackets. Upscaling production will lower the cost per jacket and will allow us to further improve it. As we're not selling the dog jackets we have on hand to retailers at present, it is hard to predict which sizes we need. With this project we can find out precisely how many pieces per size we should produce. This reduces the amount of jackets we would otherwise ""blindly"" produce in sizes that perhaps nobody needs.</p>

<div> </div>
</div>
<div><p><strong>What happens if we don't reach our goal?</strong> | We will deliver all perks wether we reach our funding goal or not. However, if we do not reach our funding goal it would mean that we would not be able to spend as much time and energy in this project as we would want to. Our main business remains making clothing for humans and we need all the resources we have to be able to keep doing this. If we manage to find enough people to support this project and our cause to make premium denim goods for humans <i>and</i> dogs in a sustainable way, we will keep doing so!</p></div>

<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>The idea for the denim dog jacket arose when recording the video below in 2019 where Dutch singer-songwriter Douwe Bob is wearing the human version of the FREDDY jacket;</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/346736653?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><br/>It all started with a birthday gift for our brand ambassador, Douwe Bob. We downsized our most popular denim jacket, the <a href=""https://amsterdenim.com/index.php/amsterdenim-jacket-freddy-trucker-candiani-am2003-610566.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FREDDY</a> heritage jacket, to fit his Shih Tsu dog Tammy. Cutting and sewing parts of an existing jacket, our first dog jacket prototype was made at the end of 2019. We received so much positive feedback, that we decided to further develop it and produce a few dozen. The first batch is sold via our <a href=""https://amsterdenim.com/index.php/amsterdenimdog.html?indiegogo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">webshop</a> only and will be sold out soon.</p>

This jacket is a sleeveless, miniature version of the jackets we have been making for humans for years now. Made in Italy using sustainable premium raw denim. We believe in ""Buy Less, Buy Better"".

No more cheap made-to-discard fashion for humans or pets! We already created the jacket, now we are looking for funds to upscale production and to make the jacket even more sustainable, using Candiani denim from partially recycled fabric.

About us | We are Amsterdenim, a small, independent Dutch jeans brand. Operating from our denim lab in Amsterdam, a former garage, we develop premium goods for the gentleman rebel. We cater to ""the biker and the banker"". We love denim, life and freedom. We are originally a menswear denim brand. Now it is time to expand, offering premium denim goods for dogs.


Why Indiegogo | First of all, we like how Indiegogo sounds like Indigo. As our main focus is to create and produce jeans for human beings, doing a second, bigger production run is something we are looking support for to get funded. We're also keen to present our brand to a whole new audience. With your support we can continue to rebel and become even more sustainable.
 

The Jacket | There are many types of dog jackets but none like this! This jacket is something you only buy once, not to use a few times and throw away. Made in Italy using premium Candiani denim fabric. Raw denim fades over time, becoming more beautiful and personal the longer you have it and wear it. The bottom of the jacket is curved to prevent your dog to wet his jacket, in the back there is a hole for the dog collar ring to attach to the leash.

French Bulldog Stitch wearing the FREDDY dog jacket and Jeremy the original FREDDY trucker.

Connect the leash through this hole in the jacket.

The lining is made from fake fur teddy so soft and warm that it will make bunny rabbits jealous. 

 

Tico is a 9 month old French Bulldog from Spain, wearing size S
 

 
The jacket will be made in Italy by Trend Srl, using sustainable Candiani Denim fabric, keeping the same high level of quality of the jacket we have now. If we manage to get enough support, this premium denim dog jacket will be produced in Italy this Winter, ready for shipment around February 2021. Candiani is known as ""The Greenest Mill in this Blue World"".
 


Sustainability is the way of the future. Sourcing the right materials and producing close to home are important, just as producing the right goods. One of the reasons for this project is also to find out which exact sizes we need to produce to avoid any waste. Perhaps the most important factor in sustainability however, is usage. It would make a huge difference if we would use the goods we have more and if we wash them less often. Using premium quality materials to create quality products that will be cared for and used and enjoyed for a long time instead of discarded.

Once the campaign is finished, we will contact you and get started right away. This needs to be done and shipped before X-Mas! We start with choosing a font and design for your dog's name. Choose the color of the yarn and let us know what else you want us to add. We will show you many options for embroidery designs, patches, studs, ruffles, the sky is the limit! It hoes without saying that this package comes with a deluxe poop bags holder.
The objective | The funding goal of € 5.000 is set to acquire a sufficient amount of Candiani denim and do a production of several hundeds of dog jackets. Upscaling production will lower the cost per jacket and will allow us to further improve it. As we're not selling the dog jackets we have on hand to retailers at present, it is hard to predict which sizes we need. With this project we can find out precisely how many pieces per size we should produce. This reduces the amount of jackets we would otherwise ""blindly"" produce in sizes that perhaps nobody needs.


 

What happens if we don't reach our goal? | We will deliver all perks wether we reach our funding goal or not. However, if we do not reach our funding goal it would mean that we would not be able to spend as much time and energy in this project as we would want to. Our main business remains making clothing for humans and we need all the resources we have to be able to keep doing this. If we manage to find enough people to support this project and our cause to make premium denim goods for humans and dogs in a sustainable way, we will keep doing so!

BACKGROUND
The idea for the denim dog jacket arose when recording the video below in 2019 where Dutch singer-songwriter Douwe Bob is wearing the human version of the FREDDY jacket;

It all started with a birthday gift for our brand ambassador, Douwe Bob. We downsized our most popular denim jacket, the FREDDY heritage jacket, to fit his Shih Tsu dog Tammy. Cutting and sewing parts of an existing jacket, our first dog jacket prototype was made at the end of 2019. We received so much positive feedback, that we decided to further develop it and produce a few dozen. The first batch is sold via our webshop only and will be sold out soon.

<strong>Timeless, Sustainable &amp; Empowering Swimwear</strong> </h2>
<p>At Salomé Swim the goal is to make beautiful and functional swimsuits, while striving for sustainability and women's empowerment. I started the company a year ago, and since then I have not stopped working to make this goal into a reality.  </p>
<p>Now I am expanding into new styles and also working towards producing them in my home town, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. I will be working with local artisan women to craft my designs, and at the same time support my community. With your help I can continue to create beautiful and eco-friendly swimwear, while also supporting my country and representing my community. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Designed by Dominican, Brooklyn-based stylist Sheyla de los Santos (me! hi!), Salomé has always been conceived as a means to support and empower women. I have worked in fashion in New York for almost a decade, styling celebrity, editorial, film and commercial shoots to support my passion for design. I am a proudly curvy woman who has fit a wide variety of body types and has seen first-hand how so many of the pieces we love in a magazine do not fit real bodies right, and are not made ethically or sustainably. I've always known my own designs would be made differently. </p>
<p>More than just a brand, Salomé strives to create a culture of support and community, a space for women to feel welcome, safe and celebrated. </p>

<h3>WHY</h3>
<p>Inspired by the women in my family and named after them, this collection represents more than just my swimsuits, it represents the possibility of working with women that just like my mother and my aunts, are hard workers, strong and resilient.  </p>

<p>My first production was made in New York, and it was educative and a true experience, but it was always my dream to take it to Dominican Republic. Being able to bring work to my country, no matter how small, fills me with great joy. This campaign is my commitment to continue making eco-friendly swimwear and bringing this work to strong and resourceful women in Dominican Republic.</p>

<h3>THE COLLECTION </h3>
<p>""Del Carmen"" capsule collection represents classic swimwear pieces and the personalities of the women that inspired them. There are three styles in this collection, Josie and Belkys below and María (still in development). <strong>The high leg cut, bust support and flattering feminine shapes are key design elements of SALOMÉ swimsuits and present in this collection.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Josie is inspired by my mother's elegance, 90's nostalgia and zest for life.</strong> Josie is designed with women of all shapes in mind, big bust of smaller bust will be comfortable equally in this delicate, playful and functional one piece. </p>

<p><strong>TraceBrace</strong> is a startup founded by six high school students, who want to be change in the small messed up country &amp; in the world. It all started on a hackathon organised by UN Women. The main goal was to create an IT solution for violence prevention against women, where we created the first prototype of TraceBrace. TraceBrace is a bracelet which sends previously entered SOS messages in the TraceBrace app on your phone. At the end of the message your location is added! We won the first place and earned six months support by <strong>UN Women</strong>. Since their support ended, we need your help to bring this product to the world &amp; make the change!</p>

The main goal was to create an IT solution for violence prevention against women, where we created the first prototype of TraceBrace. TraceBrace is a bracelet which sends previously entered SOS messages in the TraceBrace app on your phone. At the end of the message your location is added! We won the first place and earned six months support by UN Women. Since their support ended, we need your help to bring this product to the world & make the change!

 

All around the world, women and girls face sexual harassment and other forms of violence in public spaces. In many cities, a large majority of women and girls have experienced some form of violation, ranging from unwanted sexual remarks or groping to rape and gender-related killings.

Public safety of women and youth is much lower compared to that of adult males, especially in situations when moving at night through back alleys, going to concerts, parties, etc.
Statistics shows us that:

About 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual violence in their lifetime. [1]
In our country (Bosnia & Herzegovina) every second woman has experienced at least one type of violence during her lifetime, and that almost every fourth has experienced physical violence during her lifetime. [2]

We are constantly engaged in field of violence prevention trough many NGOs who are eligible on that field. The final product was developed through UN Women project „Standards and Engagement for Ending Violence against Women and Domestic Violence in Bosnia and Herzegovina“ financially supported by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida).

As financial support of UN Women and SIDA ended, we want to continue with the production. But to do that, we need money for equipment that we were renting during their support. Required equipment for production: 3D printer, working space and electronic parts. 

Yes, of course that you get one of our amazing perks, but is there anything more that you can get except the acknowledgement that you were the one who supported that global change we want to be!? Isn't that why are you here?

ZOURI is an eco-vegan footwear project that uses plastic litter from the Portuguese coast in the production of a sandals collection.  

 
COLLECTING PLASTIC LITTER FROM THE OCEAN
Together with local organizations and volunteers, we are collecting plastic debris from our ocean and beaches. With the first clean up action , we collected 1,5 tons of plastic debris in 11 beaches of Esposende, Portugal. Our goal is to create a network with all defensors of the oceans: public institutions, NGOs, schools, companies, and community for a big take action regarding the theme of plastic oceans.ECO-VEGAN & ORGANICThe plastic debris is being transformed into raw material, mixed with natural materials like cork, natural rubber and pineapple leaves fabric - Pinatex.  All raw materials are sustainable. The natural rubber, cork and jute all are completely natural and organic. We wanted since the beginning to step aside from microfibers, leather and synthetics. We want to be clear, Zouri is probably the most ecologic sandal ever made. ETHICAL & FAIRTRADEIt is in the heart of Portugal, Guimarães, that local artisans produce all ZOURI sandals.They guarantee that every pair of sandals has the same detail and perfection. When you receive your sandals you will see a letter with all materials used in the sandal, quantities, and location of plastic and the name of the person that made your Zouri. ZOURI - Sandals from the OceanEco-Vegan Footwear.

It all takes time and makes for a high end product (frames retail for 322€ upwards), but the end result is worth it  - frames with their own unique personality and comfort, which mass production can never match in terms of that hand finished quality.

<h2>The High-Low Heel</h2>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Russ Alaimo, and I'm the creator of the High-Low Heel. I'm an entrepreneur from Hallandale, Florida. My passion for creating  has led me to pursue an idea that began with a simple trip to the horse races. As my friend struggled to see over the crowd, I envisioned a collapsible shoe device that could easily transform her flats into high-heels. Today I'm in the process of getting my product licensed to a shoe company and hope to eventually create my own brand of footwear. I believe 100% in this product and my determination and persistence has kept my invention moving forward. Now I need your help. By contributing to this campaign, you will be helping me bring this unique idea to life.</p>
<h3>About The High-Low Heel</h3>
<p>The High-Low Heel features a collapsible high-heel stem that folds up underneath the shoe where it is concealed. My current prototype is featured in the video and explains how the device works. After extending the heel, a small covering is placed on the rear of the shoe for a great aesthetic. Since shoe companies are interested in seeing an excellent prototype when considering licensing, I plan to use funds generated through Indiegogo to build an improved model. </p>
<h3>The High-Low Heel &amp; The American Cancer Society</h3>
<p>In 2005, I lost my father to cancer. His death came only three weeks after his diagnosis, as there was no options for treatment. After witnessing the rapid deterioration of his health, I realized the need for more fail safes in the system in order to catch this diesease early enough to intervene. With more screening, lives can be saved. This is why I plan to donate a significant percentage of gross funds to The American Cancer Society following the licensing of the High-Low Heel.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you have an incredible charitable opportunity. When the High-Low Heel is licensed to a manufacturer, the percentage donated to the American Cancer Society will be significant. This means that by joining our team now, your contribution to this cause will become exponentially greater into the future as your investment assists me in licensing the shoe. I hope that every dollar invested into this campaign will translate to 100 donation dollars to the American Cancer Society. This cause is very important to me and I appreciate any contribution you can make. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>I Need Your Help!</h3>
<p>Even if you are unable to contribute financially, you can still help me reach my goal. By making noise in your community and through your social media outlets, you can encourage others to join the campaign! Thank you for reading and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

My passion for creating  has led me to pursue an idea that began with a simple trip to the horse races. As my friend struggled to see over the crowd, I envisioned a collapsible shoe device that could easily transform her flats into high-heels. Today I'm in the process of getting my product licensed to a shoe company and hope to eventually create my own brand of footwear. I believe 100% in this product and my determination and persistence has kept my invention moving forward. Now I need your help. By contributing to this campaign, you will be helping me bring this unique idea to life.
About The High-Low Heel
The High-Low Heel features a collapsible high-heel stem that folds up underneath the shoe where it is concealed. My current prototype is featured in the video and explains how the device works. After extending the heel, a small covering is placed on the rear of the shoe for a great aesthetic. Since shoe companies are interested in seeing an excellent prototype when considering licensing, I plan to use funds generated through Indiegogo to build an improved model. 
The High-Low Heel & The American Cancer Society
In 2005, I lost my father to cancer. His death came only three weeks after his diagnosis, as there was no options for treatment. After witnessing the rapid deterioration of his health, I realized the need for more fail safes in the system in order to catch this diesease early enough to intervene. With more screening, lives can be saved. This is why I plan to donate a significant percentage of gross funds to The American Cancer Society following the licensing of the High-Low Heel.
By contributing to this campaign, you have an incredible charitable opportunity. When the High-Low Heel is licensed to a manufacturer, the percentage donated to the American Cancer Society will be significant. This means that by joining our team now, your contribution to this cause will become exponentially greater into the future as your investment assists me in licensing the shoe. I hope that every dollar invested into this campaign will translate to 100 donation dollars to the American Cancer Society. This cause is very important to me and I appreciate any contribution you can make. 


I Need Your Help!
Even if you are unable to contribute financially, you can still help me reach my goal. By making noise in your community and through your social media outlets, you can encourage others to join the campaign! Thank you for reading and I look forward to hearing from you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I also love speed and performance.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>A New Level of
Quality in Your Kids’ Toys</b></p>
<p>Your children deserve toys that embody the best in aesthetics,
technical design, and versatile fun. That’s why we created MiniMobiles. I've spent
the past 25 years designing hundreds of products for other companies, and now it's
time for me to launch my own line of amazing toys. </p>

<br/><b></b><p><b>Cool Toys that Perform Without Friction</b></p>

MiniMobiles roll, spin, and twirl smoothly and
quickly, and they look great doing it. Through German-manufactured precision
bushings and bearings made from a proprietary, self-lubricating polymer, they are able to
move with significantly less friction than any other toy on the market. That is
the secret to their impressive motion.<p></p>

<p><b>Why We Need Your Help</b>
</p>
<p>MiniMobiles needs your help to take a big step closer towards
production. We are now working on high-quality working prototypes from our
original designs. After producing our helicopter, rocket, and car prototypes,
we’ll be attending the New York Toy Fair in February 2015 and will display the new
line of MiniMobiles to the world for the very first time.</p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Branching Out</b></p>
<p>We are forming partnerships with strategic players in the
toy industry who will support manufacturing, safety-testing, sales,
order-taking, returns, call centers, warehousing, distributing and advertising.
But first, we need to get these three beautiful prototypes to the NY Toy Fair
so that we can meet with key buyers and begin taking orders. This will be the
catalyst that launches MiniMobiles into ultimate success, and allow us to get
this line of toys tooled up (molds made) and into production.</p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp;
What You Get</b></p>
<p>We need $6,700 to CNC machine the three prototypes and have
them professionally sanded, painted, polished, and assembled. We're working
with a very high quality prototyping firm in China, and they're offering their
best fees for their services. They've made prototypes for other high end toy
manufacturers and they know what they're doing.</p>

<p><b>Get Involved in the

<p>We want Indiegogo supporters to be on the private list of
people we turn to for design feedback, ideas and decision making. You'll be
able to log into my website and see the concept sketches, view the pictures,
and watch the videos of MiniMobiles coming into fruition! It will be a form of
selective crowd sourced participation. That's a priceless experience!</p>
<p>We're also offering authentic
coupons redeemable for 75% off of an estimated $40 retail price when the MiniMobiles are ready for distribution. Our schedule will put us in production Q2 2015,</p>
<p>So, what if we don't receive all of our necessary funds?</p>
<p>We won't attend the NY Toy Fair without at least 3
prototypes, this is based upon input from industry insiders. To launch a line
of toy vehicles requires at least 3 in the line. So, we'll use whatever funds
we do receive to begin building prototypes as quickly as we can. But, we'll
have to postpone the February NY Toy Fair and instead, shoot for the ASTRA show
in June 2015 (if we have the 3 prototypes by then).</p>

<p>Lil’ tights by Skights – “Dress fo Sock-cess”….  It was December,
2011 and I was out shopping with a friend of mine.  Her son was 16 months
at the time and she wanted to purchase tights for him.  I was shocked
because I remember when I was taking my eldest who is now 13,  (wow how
the time flies) out in the winter I would put pyjama bottoms underneath his
pants to keep his legs warm.  Stylish? No, however functional. 
Unfortunately, my excitement quickly turned to disappointment when I found out
my girlfriend planned on purchasing traditional “girls tights” in neutral
colours to put on her son.  She told me she didn’t care and that her only
concern was to keep her little “Bubba’s” legs warm. </p>
<p>Prior to Skights, like every mom with boys, I had tried everything to
keep them warm, from uncomfortable pj’s under their pants to over protecting
them with snow suits.  When I saw my friend putting tights on her son I
said to myself this was crazy and there had to be a better answer for <b>ALL </b>the
moms of little boys. </p>
<p>That night I started on the journey to create Skights: functional,
practical, stylish and made in Canada. </p>
<p>Skights are easy to put on, are warm, padded at the knee for little
crawlers. If your little one is potty training and waits until the last second
to tell you “it’s potty time” no need to worry, as they can be worn on their
own your little one will not need to fuss with buttons or zippers that can be
cumbersome at times.</p>
<p>They are also fantastic if your wee one refuses to sleep with
blankets.  If your little one is anything like mine, there is nothing you
can do to keep their blanket on them at night and in the morning their tiny
toes would be “ice cold’.  Lil’ tights can be worn comfortably underneath
any piece of clothing and thanks to their design are not easily removed by
little hands.  Our tights are also great for the outdoors family.</p>
<p>Our local community, Ontario agrees with me.  Skights are now
featured in 11 local stores and national media like “Parents Canada” have
praised our product.</p>
<p>Now I need your help in getting Skights to moms and dads across Canada.<br/></p>

<br/><h3>Warum Crowdfunding?</h3>
<p>Wir sind Paprcuts.de, ein komplett eigenfinanziertes Offline Start-Up. Unser Anspruch ist es, intelligentes Produktdesign,
außergewöhnliche &amp; individuelle Gestaltung sowie regionale &amp; nachhaltige
Produktion zu verbinden.</p>
<p>Am Standort Deutschland ist das allerdings nicht günstig. 
Wir müssen jede neue Designlinie in großer Auflage vorfinanzieren. Da wir neue Portemonnaies produzieren wollen, brauchen wir dafür eure Unterstützung. Helft mit, indem ihr eine 
Vorbestellung für euren neuen Geldbeutel jetzt und hier macht - zu 
unschlagbaren Preisen! <i>Die Auslieferung erfolgt spätestens 1,5 Monate nach Kampagnenende.<br/><br/></i></p>

<br/><p><b>Why crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p>We are Paprcuts.de, a completely self-financed
offline start-up. We have the goal to bring together intelligent product
design, exceptional and individual style as well as regional and sustainable
production processes.</p>
<p>Now, we would finally like to
produce new designs! And therefore we need your support. You can help us
pre-financing our new line of designs. The complete amount collected through
funding will be used for the production of the wallets. We will send your
wallet directly to your doorstep about a month after the end of the campaign.</p>

<h3><b>The Designs </b></h3>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;""><i>Regular Size:</i>  </b>It is not possible to make it smaller! We oriented ourselves at the size of bank cards. That's the original Paprcuts-Size! The twenty Euro bill you have to fold. But it fits really in every trouser pocket! (Opened: 6.9 cm * 22 cm)</p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;""><i>Big Size:</i> </b>This is new! A lot of people asked us - That's the wallet that can carry a 50 Euro bill unfolded. Because you wanted it. And we wanted it too. Naturally we made it with a coin pocket. (Opened: 7.8 cm * 22 cm)</p>

Warum Crowdfunding?
Wir sind Paprcuts.de, ein komplett eigenfinanziertes Offline Start-Up. Unser Anspruch ist es, intelligentes Produktdesign,
außergewöhnliche & individuelle Gestaltung sowie regionale & nachhaltige
Produktion zu verbinden.
Am Standort Deutschland ist das allerdings nicht günstig. 
Wir müssen jede neue Designlinie in großer Auflage vorfinanzieren. Da wir neue Portemonnaies produzieren wollen, brauchen wir dafür eure Unterstützung. Helft mit, indem ihr eine 
Vorbestellung für euren neuen Geldbeutel jetzt und hier macht - zu 
unschlagbaren Preisen! Die Auslieferung erfolgt spätestens 1,5 Monate nach Kampagnenende.
Die Produktion ist gesichert - doch es geht weiter!



Die Designlinien 

Regular Size: Kleiner geht nicht! Hier haben wir
uns an der Größe
der Bankkarten orientiert. Das ist die bisherige Paprcuts-Größe! Ab den Zwanni muss man die Scheine
falten. Dafür
passt es wirklich in jede Hosentasche! (Aufgeklappt: 6,9 cm * 22 cm)
Big Size: Ab
jetzt neu bei uns - weil uns schon einige Leute gefragt haben. Das Portemonnaie, in das man auch den
alten Perso & den Fünfziger
bekommt! Natürlich auch mit Münzfach. (Aufgeklappt: 7,8 cm * 22 cm)
Die Neon Designs (Regular und Big Size)





Welche Farbe magst du am liebsten? Verziert und zusammengehalten sind die ausgewählten Farbkombinationen mit einer Zickzack-Naht in Neonfarbe! Hiermit nochmal danke an unsere Lieblingsnäherin Swantje für die tolle Arbeit.

Die Neondesigns sind als Regular Size und als Big Size verfügbar.

Die Illustrationen (nur als Regular Size)





Die Sehnsucht nach dem Wasser begleitet den Menschen von klein auf. Mit diesen Portemonnaies hast du das Meer immer bei dir. 

Die Illustrationen haben wir nur als Regular Size.

All Time Classics (nur als Big Size)


Wir wurden oft danach gefragt: Das Portemonnaie, in das man auch den alten Perso & den Fünfziger bekommt. Ab jetzt mit unseren beliebtesten Motiven! Natürlich auch mit Münzfach. 
Die All Time Classics haben wir nur als Big Size.


Das Portemonnaie












Geldscheine,
Bank- und Businesskarten, ein Foto von der Ex. Mehr brauchst Du nicht und genau
das macht die bunten Portemonnaies so praktisch. Wozu alles reinpacken, wenn
man eigentlich nur feiern will?!
Wenn
doch mal mehr mit soll? Easy! Das Material Tyvek®ist super dehnbar! Unsere Paprcuts wachsen demnach mit
ihren Aufgaben und passen sich deinem Inhalt an. Große Scheine werden gefaltet
Kleingeld?
Ist überbewertet!
Wenn’s trotzdem rein muss, mit unserem superdünnen, hart praktischen Münzfach seid ihr ganz vorne mit dabei.
Das verwendete Dual Lock Verschluss System ist viel klüger und ausdauernder als ein normaler
Klettverschluss.







Unser Portemonnaie im Alltag














Unser Portemonnaie macht sich durch
seine Kompaktheit super beim Weggehen, ob auf Parties & Festivals oder für's Kino. Auch als Begleiter bei
allen Outdoorsportarten wie Snowboarden, Skaten oder Kiten eignet sich das
Portemonnaie perfekt. Benutzen werdet ihr es irgendwann sowieso immer und jeden
Tag, das könnt
ihr uns glauben!

Die Produktion ist gesichert - doch es geht weiter!
Die Mindestproduktionsmenge der neuen Portemonnaies ist erreicht! Wir möchten uns dafür bei unseren vielen Supportern bedanken! Deswegen erhält jeder Unterstützer am Ende der Kampagne einen Rabattcode für unsere wunderschönen Kosmetiktaschen. Die Höhe des Rabattes steigt mit der Fundingsumme: 
15.000 € = 15 % Rabatt16.000 € = 16 % Rabatt.,50.000 € = Max. 50 % Rabatt!Danke für die tollen Emails und Euer Engagement!

verfolgen: wunderschöne,
praktische und innovative Produkte produzieren. Zudem legen wir großen Wert auf Nachhaltigkeit. Daher ist Tyvek zu 100% recycelbar, sollten unsere Produkte irgendwann mal den Geist
aufgeben.



Risiken
Der Produktionsprozess von Tyvek-Portemonnaies
unter fairen Bedingungen in Deutschland ist kein einfaches Unterfangen. Da wir
jedoch seit zwei Jahren Erfahrung in der Verarbeitung des Materials gesammelt
haben, können wir garantieren, dass die Portemonnaies mit der entsprechenden
Bestellmenge pünktlich ausgeliefert werden. 

Unser Zeitplan
August / September: Kampagne Crowdfunding
September: Organisation der Bestellungen, Einkauf des Materials und Start der Produktion. Danke schon mal vorab für eure Unterstützung!
Oktober: Qualitätskontrolle, Verpacken und Ausliefern eurer Bestellungen. HipHipHurray!!
November: Jede(r)
 UnterstützerIn bekommt einen Gutscheincode für Weihnachtsgeschenke. 
Dieser ist nur für unsere Crowdfunder, niemand anders bekommt diesen 
Special Deal!Wenn das kein Grund zum Feiern ist!!

Why crowdfunding?
We are Paprcuts.de, a completely self-financed
offline start-up. We have the goal to bring together intelligent product
design, exceptional and individual style as well as regional and sustainable
production processes.
Now, we would finally like to
produce new designs! And therefore we need your support. You can help us
pre-financing our new line of designs. The complete amount collected through
funding will be used for the production of the wallets. We will send your
wallet directly to your doorstep about a month after the end of the campaign.
Minimal production is funded - but it's not over yet!


The Designs 
Regular Size:  It is not possible to make it smaller! We oriented ourselves at the size of bank cards. That's the original Paprcuts-Size! The twenty Euro bill you have to fold. But it fits really in every trouser pocket! (Opened: 6.9 cm * 22 cm)
Big Size: This is new! A lot of people asked us - That's the wallet that can carry a 50 Euro bill unfolded. Because you wanted it. And we wanted it too. Naturally we made it with a coin pocket. (Opened: 7.8 cm * 22 cm)

Neon Design (available as Regular & Big Size)

Which color do you prefer? Decorated and held together by a neon colored stitching! We would like to thanks our favorite sewing worker Svantje for her awesome work. The neon editions are available in Regular Size and Big Size.


Illustrations (only as Regular Size)







The desire for the eternal water accompanies us our whole life. With this wallet you are carrying the sea in your pocket.
The illustrations are only available as Regular Size.

All Time Classics (only as Big Size)

A lot of people asked us for it: Get our all times classics as a big wallet and pack it with pictures, cards and whatever you like to carry with you.

The Classics are only available as Big Size.





Our Wallets









Our wallet is so compact, you don’t even notice it in your pants or handbag when you go
out… partying, to
festivals, the cinema or wherever. Plus: if you’re a fan of outdoor sports like snowboarding, skating
or kite surfing our wallet is
your ideal companion! Eventually you will use it always and every day,
trust us with that!

Every day life with our wallet - it's beautiful!











Minimal Production is Funded - but it's not over yet!





The production of the new wallet designs is confirmed! We are very grateful for your commitment! Every supporter will get an exclusive voucher code for our cosmetic bags at the end of the campaign. The discount gets higher the more the funding amount grows:
€ 15,000  = 15 % Discount!€ 16,000 = 16 % Discount!.
.
€ 50.000 € = max. 50 % Discount!Thanks again for all the feedback and support!

Made in Berlin. Not in 广东省.
We are based right in the middle of
Berlin Kreuzberg. Here we design our super nice Paprcuts accessories for you.
To guarantee fair production conditions and because it makes sense for us to
support the local market, we stick to the following guidelines: Printing,
folding, and sewing - everything is
produced in Berlin and surroundings in close cooperation with social projects.



Funding










Paprcuts.de
Sleek accessories made out of tear-
and waterproof tyvek. Ultra light, super thin and minimalistic - that’s what Paprcuts stands for. We are a team of young
crazy people from Berlin who have one goal: to produce super nice, practical
and innovative products. On top of that, sustainability is an important issue
for us. Therefore is Tyvek 100% recyclable, once our products cease to perform
at one point - which has
barely been the case yet!



Risks
The socially and environmentally sustainable
production process of Tyvek wallets made in Germany is not an easy task.
However, since we already have two years of experience in the making of this
product, we can guarantee that the wallets and the respective number ordered
will be delivered on time. 
Timetable
August/September:
Crowdfunding campaign
September:
Organisation of orders, purchase of
materials and start of production. Thank you all very much already for your
valuable support!
October:
Quality control, packaging and
delivery of your purchases. Hip, hip, hooray!!
November:
Every supporter receives a voucher
code for Christmas presents. Those codes will only be made available for our
crowdfunding supporters!

Let's stay in touch!

business cards, 5 taxi receipts, 7 restaurant receipts, bank notes, coins and a
few counter receipts.

<p>So why did
we start UNAA?  Well,  we started it based upon the TV show American
Ninja Warrior.  We all love competing
and many of us submitted our videos to be on the show.  Unfortunately many of us did not get picked.  We
later found out that over 50,000 videos were submitted and only 700 get picked
to be on the show.  So that left 49,000
plus athletes that had been training and preparing with no place to compete.  Many gyms across the country were having local
competitions,  but we wanted to have a
big National qualifying series competition with a  large payout.</p>
<p>So ,  this is where We come in.  Who are we?  Charlie Mitchell is the COO and Head
Official.  He is passionate about the
sport and is the manager at our local gym in Albuquerque called Ninja
Park.  He has a military and fitness
background.   My name is Bob Clark, the CEO and Director and
I come from a background in sales and business ownership.  I currently work at a local TV station here
in Albuquerque and I also own a Motocross track called Sandia MX.  I have been in the promoting business for
over 20 years and  between Charlie and
myself we have conducted over 200 events from Motocross and Mud Bogs to
Concerts and 5K Mud Runs to Ninja Warrior obstacle course events.</p>

<br/>
<p>We still
love the show American Ninja Warrior and because of the show ,  it allows us the opportunity to open up the
UNAA for all those athletes that not only did NOT make the show,  but also for those that are on the show and
want another option in competition to win some big money for all their hard
work and training.  We are starting
this first year with $27,000 total payout for Men and Women classes through Top
5.  Our ultimate goal and dream would
be to one day provide enough revenue to the Top 10 athletes ,  that they could actually make a living doing
what they are so passionate about.  </p>

<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">In ALQUIMIA we are committed to make the world a better place by empowering mothers through convenient clothing to accomplish extended breastfeeding while being free to carry out an exciting life. </span></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As we started to prepare for the arrival of our first baby, we wanted to learn everything that we could about how to better raise our child. During that process we found that breastfeeding was a crucial part of the process, We also faced the problems that mothers all around the world face.</span></p>
<p>There was no clothing line that offers the mothers the possibility of comfortably feed their baby without sacrificing style. </p>
<p>With your help, we will launch a clothing line specifically designed to make the experience of breastfeeding as positive as possible while allowing the mothers to shine with style. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding to launch our first production batch at economical costs. We have so far produced a few prototypes, but in order to buy the materials (fabrics, buttons and accessories), start the shop where we will be manufacturing and arrange the logistics of delivery to the USA, we need a minimum batch size.</p>
<p>By funding ALQUIMIA through Indiegogo, you will receive the product of your choosing from our site. Funders can choose multiple types of Perks. There are small perks like our stickers and water bottles that will highlight their support of the breastfeeding effort of mothers all around the world. Funders can also request specific clothing items and they can also order packages in order to prepare or help a loved one to get ready for the breastfeeding life.</p>
<p>We are 100% committed to make ALQUIMIA a reality that will eventually support millions of moms to have a more satisfying nursing experience. That is why if we do not reach our target on this campaign, we will make sure all funders receive their perks. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Breastfeeding is the most valuable gift any one human can give to another one... and it happens at a massively large global scale. However, in many parts of the developed world, conditions are starting to push mothers towards importantly deficient alternatives. </p>
<p>We want to put a dent into this trend by changing the conditions. We want to allow the convenience tradeoffs for mothers to be reduced so they are more likely to follow the beautiful love path of breastfeeding. </p>
<p>We found that this is the best way to put our team´s business management and marketing experience into making a difference for the generations of the future that are just now arriving to this world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always plenty of risks to manage when starting a small business. Every process of the company may present hidden challenges that did not come up during the initial planning stages. </p>
<p>Knowing this and being certain that we are not perfect, we have discussed our business plan and our operational process with industry experts in order to discover the ""unkown unknowns"". We have dig deep into the process of fabric procurement, fashion design, manufacturing, distribution, online retail and online marketing. </p>
<p>The complete list of the risks associated is longer than this whole document, however we can highlight the main risks and briefly mention the containment plan for each:</p>
<p><b>Product and branding design not fitting with target</b></p>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We have talked to dozens of mothers interested in breastfeeding about the design principles and styles. The indiegogo campaign will be the first test of fire to see if there is acceptance of the designs outside of our semi-immediate social circle.  </span></li></ul>
<div> </div>
<p><b>Demand uncertainty</b></p>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Starting through indiegogo will allow us to control and plan for the demand in advance. We will closely monitor the campaign statistics and in that way we will be able to better predict how much production will be required by the end of it. If demand is higher than expected, we will be able to limit the amount of request for any given model; if demand is small, we will be able to produce a small production batch so we do not end up deep in the red.</span></li></ul>
<div> </div>
<p><b>Manufacturing quality  </b></p>
<ul><li>It is crucial for us that ALQUIMIA clothes are of the highest quality. We have carefully selected the people that will handle the manufacturing based on their professional reputation and sample products. We have worked with them in several rounds of prototype productions to make sure that the quality are in every detail of every item so that we do not encounter problems in the first production run.</li></ul>
<div> </div>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If for some reason you cannot fund at this moment, you can still do plenty to help the breastfeeding cause we are supporting. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Please get the word out about what we are doing by: </span></p>

</div></div>","In ALQUIMIA we are committed to make the world a better place by empowering mothers through convenient clothing to accomplish extended breastfeeding while being free to carry out an exciting life. 
 
As we started to prepare for the arrival of our first baby, we wanted to learn everything that we could about how to better raise our child. During that process we found that breastfeeding was a crucial part of the process, We also faced the problems that mothers all around the world face.
There was no clothing line that offers the mothers the possibility of comfortably feed their baby without sacrificing style. 
With your help, we will launch a clothing line specifically designed to make the experience of breastfeeding as positive as possible while allowing the mothers to shine with style. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
We need funding to launch our first production batch at economical costs. We have so far produced a few prototypes, but in order to buy the materials (fabrics, buttons and accessories), start the shop where we will be manufacturing and arrange the logistics of delivery to the USA, we need a minimum batch size.
By funding ALQUIMIA through Indiegogo, you will receive the product of your choosing from our site. Funders can choose multiple types of Perks. There are small perks like our stickers and water bottles that will highlight their support of the breastfeeding effort of mothers all around the world. Funders can also request specific clothing items and they can also order packages in order to prepare or help a loved one to get ready for the breastfeeding life.
We are 100% committed to make ALQUIMIA a reality that will eventually support millions of moms to have a more satisfying nursing experience. That is why if we do not reach our target on this campaign, we will make sure all funders receive their perks. 



 


*Once the order is placed you will recieve an email asking for sizing options.
 
The Impact
Breastfeeding is the most valuable gift any one human can give to another one... and it happens at a massively large global scale. However, in many parts of the developed world, conditions are starting to push mothers towards importantly deficient alternatives. 
We want to put a dent into this trend by changing the conditions. We want to allow the convenience tradeoffs for mothers to be reduced so they are more likely to follow the beautiful love path of breastfeeding. 
We found that this is the best way to put our team´s business management and marketing experience into making a difference for the generations of the future that are just now arriving to this world.
 
 


Risks & Challenges
There are always plenty of risks to manage when starting a small business. Every process of the company may present hidden challenges that did not come up during the initial planning stages. 
Knowing this and being certain that we are not perfect, we have discussed our business plan and our operational process with industry experts in order to discover the ""unkown unknowns"". We have dig deep into the process of fabric procurement, fashion design, manufacturing, distribution, online retail and online marketing. 
The complete list of the risks associated is longer than this whole document, however we can highlight the main risks and briefly mention the containment plan for each:
Product and branding design not fitting with target
We have talked to dozens of mothers interested in breastfeeding about the design principles and styles. The indiegogo campaign will be the first test of fire to see if there is acceptance of the designs outside of our semi-immediate social circle.  
 
Demand uncertainty
Starting through indiegogo will allow us to control and plan for the demand in advance. We will closely monitor the campaign statistics and in that way we will be able to better predict how much production will be required by the end of it. If demand is higher than expected, we will be able to limit the amount of request for any given model; if demand is small, we will be able to produce a small production batch so we do not end up deep in the red.
 
Manufacturing quality  
It is crucial for us that ALQUIMIA clothes are of the highest quality. We have carefully selected the people that will handle the manufacturing based on their professional reputation and sample products. We have worked with them in several rounds of prototype productions to make sure that the quality are in every detail of every item so that we do not encounter problems in the first production run.
 


Other Ways You Can Help
If for some reason you cannot fund at this moment, you can still do plenty to help the breastfeeding cause we are supporting. Please get the word out about what we are doing by:

Our Story
We are a start-up family owned business located in Woodhaven, NY. We specialize in large volume orders and love the idea of making personalized balloon favors. Our idea stemmed on the constant trends in the market right now of lack of personalization and costly gifts, centerpieces, etc. We want to provide affordable and quality items for everyone.


The Impact
Our campaign is based on creating new innovative products that are smaller than our current model to make affordability more possible as well as create quality gift baskets for a reasonable price. If our campaign is unsuccessful, we cannot continue to expand our ideas.


What We Need & What You Get
What we are asking for: 
We are asking for $1000. This money will be used directly for bulk supplies and marketing material for ""Gifts in a Balloon"" and ""Home-made Gift Baskets"". 

Funding Sources: We currently run a virtual company and all funding has come from personal savings for set-up costs. We currently run an online store and are slowly creating momentum via social networking and referrals.
If we do not meet our goals in this campaign, we won't be able to introduce our products at this time, but hopefully in the long-run we can utilize some of our profits to expand. 

What you get: 
We want to provide samples of the contents in our products to individuals who help our campaign a reality.
This includes brownies, cookies, chocolate pops - or samples of the actual product.

<p>This DVD is something that lies very close to my heart as a lot of kids as well as adults who do not have the funds (in the economy that currently afflicts most countries around the world) to attend clinics to learn to become better players. What this DVD will do for you is to give you an in depth breakdown of how you can become the next star athlete. Fedorov breaks it down in such an easy way that anyone can understand it and mimic it. Fedorov and ourselves have actually paid for this whole project out of our own pocket. Many people think that we have had major sponsors etc That is not true.</p>
<p>What is true is the fact that the entire film is more or less done. So you might be wondering why we would need your money before the product is put out on the market? Easy making the product is only the first part now comes the marketing, the production of the DVD’s, and the distribution. This is what we need your help with.</p>

<p>Like I have described before, our funding is going towards the making of DVD’s and also towards the marketing.  This is a professional produced DVD meaning that they will be sent out and pressed just like any movie you would buy at a store. This is not a cheap process and you have to quite a large quantity at once. There are still some things we wish to record but we need to rent certain equipment to give the DVD that small extra push that we believe can benefit everyone.</p>
<p>We also have the marketing portion. We live in Sweden and this DVD is something that we have planned to market at the PSP World Cup, Millennium Series but as we all know a booth at these events is not cheap but it is <a href=""https://www.google.se/search?hl=sv&amp;safe=off&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=979&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m8kWUI3ODuj04QTVlYDgAQ&amp;ved=0CFwQBSgA&amp;q=necessary&amp;spell=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong><em>necessary</em></strong></a><strong><em>.  </em></strong>We will have posters and other goodies such as t-shirts with us at the events so if you have funded us big or small your getting something right then and there.</p>

</div><p></p></div>","Hi, I'm Alpha Talk.I am a fragrance designer who has created custom handmade fragrances for celebrities such as Yandy Smith (Love & Hip Hop NY), Cassie (Bad Boy Entertainment), Ledisi (Grammy nominated singer), Ramona Rizzo of (VH1 Mob Wives) and more. I have been creating perfumes since June of 2011, but what I enjoy most is being able to help and positively influence people. What I have realized is that so many of us aren't getting all the encouragement and support we need to thrive in this world, so I decided to take action by using my personality, experiences and fragrances to create lasting impressions on people.Your sense of smell has the most direct connection to the center of your brain which directly controls emotion in human beings, so I figured that if I could make people smile with their noses, why not make them smile with their hearts?I need your help to build more awareness of Alpha Talk and encourage more people to chase their passions while living peacefully. By assisting me, you enable me to continue blessing and inspiring others in many different ways.  Who is Alpha Talk?People are always asking me: ""How did you get into fragrances?"". My answer to that question now is: I want to be able to make people smile without being near them, I want them to feel of importance when they experience my products and services. We all are people, not just customers and clients.

a young boy, allowing him to go school<i>.</i> This small act sparked the creation of Pur[shoe]ing Joy, which aims to help other Guatemalans “pur[shoe]” their dreams. In February of 2014, Pur[shoe]ing Joy
plans to bring over 1000 pairs of shoes down to Guatemala. Every pair of shoes donated allows a child to pursue an education and a better life.</p>

mom as well as a full time social worker at a middle school.  I also am a
part time photographer.  After having my son Aiden, I got to thinking more
about my career options.  I began to seriously consider doing photography
full time in order to be my own boss, spend more time with my son (and
hopefully another child eventually), all the while doing something that makes
me feel creative, happy and accomplished. </p>
<p>So
I started down the road of advertising myself and creating my
""business"".  I began by upgrading my website.  At first I
primarily used Facebook to promote myself, which does great things but doesn't
have the reach I would like.  I developed a new website that showcases my
work in a more professional manner.  Of course that costs money, but if
I'm not willing to invest in myself, how can I expect anyone else to be?</p>
<p>This
summer, I created a breastfeeding project called ""The Beautiful
Bond"".  I posted on a local breastfeeding Facebook group for
volunteer moms willing to let me take their picture while they nursed their
child, whether in public or in the comfort of their own home.  The
response I received was tremendous, and I spent my summer falling more in love
with the act of breastfeeding.  Coincidentally, this is when the big
breastfeeding in public debate really started to heat up.  I had never
realized that it was such an issue.  How could anything so beautiful and
natural be a controversy?  This brought even more meaning to my
project and made me feel even more fulfilled. The moms involved really wanted
to show their bravery and stand against people who say that they should cover
up when feeding their child.  It was then that my desire to do more things
like this in my life arose.</p>
<p>The
trick to such a thing, changing careers and taking the plunge, is needing some
start up capital.  For a photographer, I need better equipment.  I
have my trusty Canon Rebel XTi.  It's treated me well since the day my
husband gave it to me as a wedding present, but, it's taken me about as far as
it can go.  I have some great lenses that don't work to their fullest
capacity because of my camera body.  The tricky part is, it's expensive to
upgrade.  AND, if I want more clients and a better product to gain more
clients, I need better equipment!  See the conundrum?  So I'm asking
for some help.  The project is an investment in my business, HoneyBrown
Photography, but really, with the rewards I'm offering for your pledges, I'm
making YOU the project.  I want to take pictures for you, and OF you, my
investors.  I will travel within a 1 hour radius of Schaumburg, IL to take
photos of you, your family, a landscape you love, etc.  Or if you're
coming in from out of town and want pictures in Chicago (or Schaumburg if that
floats your boat), that's great too!  I will then pull together some of
the pictures of you, my Kickstarter investors, and put them into a project to
display your kindness and generosity.  It's win win really!  I get more
clients AND you get professional photos taken with quality equipment!</p>
<p>Thank
you in advance for your support!  I look forward to capturing your
memories!</p><br/></div>","I am a full time first time

Patent PendingSometimes it's about what you don't see. Most of our shoelace pictures are up-close shots portraying a unique design with parallel lines. They actually look really cool and add some character. From eye level though, it's a different story. You would never spot them on someone passing by.Minimal by design. The Lace Anchors are manufactured from a fiber filled resin providing amazing strength and preventing any breakage or warping. The end clips, if used, have multiple rows of teeth that clinch the laces. This allows you to pull as hard as you would like without the end clips separating from the laces. We did, however, design the end clips to be adjustable, this means you can unlock them and re-lock them if you need to make shoelace length adjustments.It's about combining style, comfort and convenience. Our Xpand shoe lacing system packs a powerful punch. We want to make sure that we have our bases covered when it comes to all aspects of wearing your shoes. First we offer you 24 colors. Then we offer you a fully adjustable fit providing comfort whether you're heading out for a night on the town or running a marathon. Last but not least, you will never have to tie your shoes again! We know it's not some crazy technology product promising to teleport you to the moon, but we can guarantee it will bring a smile to your face everyday you slip your feet in.  Sometimes it's about the simple things in life.Zero interruptions, 100% focus. When using our lacing system, your shoes will never cause any distractions like untied laces or tension loss.

to find creative and unconventional uses for items that might get thrown away.
I do this by incorporating found materials and re-purposed items like scrap,
precious metals and electrical washers.<span style=""""> 
</span>When it comes to fabrics, I like to use burlap alongside silks, linens
and organic cottons, creating a stark contrast between the luxury of silk and

Who is Kimya Glasgow, the brand?
Kimya Glasgow is
a clothing line started by me, Kimya Glasgow. I am based in the Caribbean, on
the small multi-island nation of St Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG).  The goal of this fundraiser is to help our small company
raise funds to attend Miami Fashion Week to show our new collection as part of a
showcase of designers representing the Caribbean this coming March 2012.
At Kimya Glasgow, I design
sophisticated yet edgy Women and Men's clothing from natural and eco-friendly fabrics.  While I may design custom clothing for many
different occasions and styles my main focus
is Resort and Cruise wear.  
A major influence on my designs
and the materials I use, comes from the deep history of the people of SVG.  The people of this country have always relied
on their ability to make do with very little and to let nothing go to waste and
to find creative and unconventional uses for items that might get thrown away.
I do this by incorporating found materials and re-purposed items like scrap,
precious metals and electrical washers. 
When it comes to fabrics, I like to use burlap alongside silks, linens
and organic cottons, creating a stark contrast between the luxury of silk and
the humbleness of burlap. I also use hand-painting and printing influenced by
the art and nature found throughout SVG.
The funding from this
program will help me develop and
market my new collection, which will be part of Miami Fashion week in March
2012.



The Impact

No man is an island, so even though our company is small, I work with many local artisans and talented sewers on the island to make our work possible. Miami Fashion Week will give our brand the attention we need to attract Resort and Cruise Wear buyers.

<p><span>David, my 6yr old son, is diagnosed with Moebius and Pierre-Robin Syndromes. The issues associated with them include paralysed facial nerves, paralysed vocal chords, low muscle tone, tight and underdeveloped ligaments etc. David has a Tracheotomy to breathe and is non-verbal. Due to low muscle tone and ligament/tendon issues (Arthrogryposis) he has no balance and must walk with a walker, or holding the hand of an adult (which he does not like to do at the moment, he is a ""Big Boy"" now!!), or, as he has been lately, he takes off with one speed - super fast- but does not have the ability to halt himself safely other than to drop to the ground. He also has no sense of safety and so road (and other) dangers are a very real issue with him. </span><br/><span>David has regular suctioning, day and night, of his Tracheotomy tube to keep his airway clear. He needs constant 1-on-1 attention 24/7.</span><br/><br/><span>Despite being ""High Medical needs"" and all of the above plus some, David is a smart, funny, caring boy who loves to make you laugh, and has great potential. I am very proud of my boy who has so far been to the operating theatre 33 times with many more to come. </span><br/><br/><span>I came across ADNZ on the internet and we applied to see if David would be a candidate for an Assistance Dog to aid him with mobility, dangers (like crossing the road as David has no sense of the dangers despite all efforts to instil it in him!) but also to give David some freedom and independance from being constantly watched. Though he can not suction himself, an ADNZ dog can be trained to recognise the sounds and alert me. This will provide David with some level of ""normalacy"" in his environment regarding control and independance.</span><br/><span>We had a trial to see if this is a viable option for us so helped with an ADNZ dog called Marley, and in 24hrs he was already showing an interest when David coughed and needed the suction machine, so the potential is huge for success.</span><br/><br/><span>To train and raise these special dogs takes alot of time and money, and we are asked to contribute towards this cost.</span><br/><br/><span>I am asking for help to do this.</span><br/><span>Having an ADNZ dog will be so life changing for David that I dont want him to miss out because of financial restrictions.</span><br/><br/><span>A bit of information of what ADNZ dogs can do:</span><br/><span>ADNZ dogs are trained specifically to assist with every day tasks that may be difficult when there is an impairment or disadvantage present. </span><br/><span>Assistance Dogs, when properly trained, can:</span><br/><span>• Help improve a childs socialisation and behaviour skills.</span><br/><span>• Create freedom for the child and family members to go out of the house safely and confidently.</span><br/><span>• Expand a childs capabilities to experience more of life and to grow.</span><br/><span>• Calm the child thereby giving them an increased attention span and greater aptitude for learning.</span><br/><span>• Increase safety levels and alleviate the dangers by acting as an anchor when tethered to the child.</span><br/><br/><span>It costs between $40,000 - $50,000 + to raise and train an Assistance Dog.</span><br/><br/><span>Recipients of ADNZ Assistance Dogs are currently asked to (please) help the Charity by raising money towards the costs associated with training and raising an Assistance Dog which will go to that family as ADNZ is not as well known as other charities such as Guide Dogs and have not got the funding available to fully shoulder these costs.</span><br/><br/><span>Your support with our fundraising mission, means David will receive a dog which will help keep him safe, enrich his life, provide him with that much needed companionship and make life inside and outside of the home much easier for him.</span><br/><br/><span>Hopefully, by sharing Davids story, we can help raise awareness about Assistance Dogs and the vital role they can play in the lives of people living with disabilities. </span></p>
<p><span>I have been trying for the last year and a half to raise money, we have managed $3000 so far, but we need to ramp up the fundraising as quickly as possible because there is a match for David. A black Labrador who is perfect for my son. </span></p>
<p><span>I know that asking for $20,000 is massive, but if 10,000 people donated $2 each, we would have the money needed.

Miricca was always good to be still on the changing pad durring the diaper change. Liam on the other hand, was a real twister on the changing table every single time we were about to change his diaper. From around 4 month old, he was almost impossible to hold and i was scared, that he would some day fall down from the changing station. <p></p>
<p>I googled many hours to find some design harness sollutions for the changing pad, but only thing i found, was a few very unpractical devices which was only available in a few countries. There was nothing to buy in stores in Denmark!</p>
<p>Through the searchings i read about statistics regarding children falling from changing pads and changing stations and it was even worse than i thought. I imediately <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">started designing my own safety harnesses... using soft and comfortable fabrics and focussing on the quality and function of the product. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I created the brandname and logo for the company (profesionals did the graphics) and we are very far in this project. We need the final steps to bring this out in stores accross the world. We already have these products placed and ready at our factory, prepared for start up production. We just need the final certifications and tests... </span></p>

<h4>Changing Table Related Injuries. </h4>
<p>Falling is the cause of most injuries to children <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">under 5 years of age (65%). A quarter of </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">childhood injuries in the home environment are as </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">a result of a fall from nursery furniture. Most </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">injuries occur when a baby rolls to the side and </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">falls off the change table. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Falls occur in children as young as three months, </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Head injuries are the most common injury, with </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">many children requiring hospital admission. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Children falling up to 1.5metres to the floor or onto </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">another piece of furniture can suffer: </span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Serious head injuries. </span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Concussion. </span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">fractures to the body. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Researchers estimate that 8 out of 10 injuries would <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">be prevented by a correctly used restraint fitted to </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">the change table. However, nothing is a substitute </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">for constant adult supervision. It is far safer for the </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">adult to get down to the child’s level. If your back </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">and knees allow, change baby on the floor or on a </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">bed. </span></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Many injuries result from babies falling off changing tables onto the floor. </li>

<p>To many children under the age of 2, fall from the changing station durring his or hers first periode of life. To prevend and avoid this, there are a few pads with a simple strap around. Many parrents dont buy this type of product because it is NOT suited for a newborn and it is not very childfriendly. When your baby grow, you often dont buy a new pad, for many reasons.                              </p>
<p>I know that durring a diaper change situation, it is very important to keep one hand on the baby, supporting him or her, from fall. I always does that... but i also know how hard that is, when the baby is struggeling to get loose, while having all the ""poopie"" up and down the neck. </p>
<p>Parents need both hands free to make the diaper change as comfortable and quick as possible, and that is why the changing devices were made. Often the accidents happen because of a stressful situation. When using these devices, you can focus on what you need... to clean your babys butt and make sure the baby is happy and secure. you DONT need to fight and smear it all over, and making a simpel diaper change, something that you hate. Many parents experience this... and sometimes the accidents happen only because of this mess... I made these for myself but realized that everyone i talked with, wanted and needed these to. </p>
<p>I want to fight the statistics and bring down the number of accidents hopefully close to 0. But, i also know, that there will always be parents out there who dont THINK they need this - untill the accident happens. </p>

Liam on the other hand, was a real twister on the changing table every single time we were about to change his diaper. From around 4 month old, he was almost impossible to hold and i was scared, that he would some day fall down from the changing station. 
I googled many hours to find some design harness sollutions for the changing pad, but only thing i found, was a few very unpractical devices which was only available in a few countries. There was nothing to buy in stores in Denmark!
Through the searchings i read about statistics regarding children falling from changing pads and changing stations and it was even worse than i thought. I imediately started designing my own safety harnesses... using soft and comfortable fabrics and focussing on the quality and function of the product. 
I created the brandname and logo for the company (profesionals did the graphics) and we are very far in this project. We need the final steps to bring this out in stores accross the world. We already have these products placed and ready at our factory, prepared for start up production. We just need the final certifications and tests...

Eliminate The Diaper Changing Struggles


baBsafe harnesses is a secure, easy way to use restraint to hold a baby or toddler safely on a diaper changing pad, keeping them from rolling away or escaping during diaper changes. 




It eliminates the diaper changing battles.
Adds an extra level of security when you are reaching for the diapers and wipes.
No more accidents of baby falling off the changing table when you didn’t know that he or she could roll yet.
Acts like extra hands to hold a baby’s shoulders down on the changing pad.
Keeps your hands free to do the dirty work of diaper changing.
Works on changing stations in public bathrooms.
How does it work?






Inhibits rolling at the shoulder level.
The baBsafe safety harnesses needs a stiff backed changing pad to be attached to. Cardboard can be used to stiffen the back if your pad is soft.
The weight of the child on the pad in combination with the vest and solid back of the pad keep the child from rolling.
The baBsafe changing harnesses buckles around the back of the pad.
It fastens around the child using hook and loop(velcro), and has two chest, and two shoulder straps that come up and over the shoulders and fasten onto the harness front and back.
The baBsafe safety harnesses is not meant to be used as a safety device, and is no substitute for parent supervision.
Never leave child unattended.
Pad not included.

Keep your baby safe using baBsafe safety harnesses.











To make this happen, WE NEED YOU and your contribution. We dont need alot, I only need a very small amount from ALOT of people                                                      :O)

                                                 





This should not even be a question for anyone... 
                                                                       
                                          

Changing Table Related Injuries. 
Falling is the cause of most injuries to children under 5 years of age (65%). A quarter of childhood injuries in the home environment are as a result of a fall from nursery furniture. Most injuries occur when a baby rolls to the side and falls off the change table. Falls occur in children as young as three months, Head injuries are the most common injury, with many children requiring hospital admission. Children falling up to 1.5metres to the floor or onto another piece of furniture can suffer: 


Serious head injuries. 
Concussion. 
fractures to the body. 



Researchers estimate that 8 out of 10 injuries would be prevented by a correctly used restraint fitted to the change table. However, nothing is a substitute for constant adult supervision. It is far safer for the adult to get down to the child’s level. If your back and knees allow, change baby on the floor or on a bed. 



Many injuries result from babies falling off changing tables onto the floor. 
Make sure the table has safety straps and always use them when changing your baby.
Never leave your baby unattended on a changing table.



To many children under the age of 2, fall from the changing station durring his or hers first periode of life. To prevend and avoid this, there are a few pads with a simple strap around. Many parrents dont buy this type of product because it is NOT suited for a newborn and it is not very childfriendly.

My wish is that it should be as natural to use a changing pad safety device, as it is using a safety device for high chairs and prams!!!!!



IF I reach the total goal of 36.000 USD - i will see to it, that first move after receiving support in any ways are the laboratory tests for Oeko-Tex certificate and CE - to make sure everything is perfect before babies around the world will use theese changing devices.Next step is all the design layouts so we can start the production and last, all the paperwork that lawyers are going to make - as we need aggreements and contracts and of course many other things but theese are the most important before selling to many forreign countries. IF there is any left back, we have a few great new designs we would like to introduce also - but it all cost.




We pray to reach at least 14000 USD - its still alot, but after taxes, the fees etc., theres not much left for the two big steps we need to be done with, thats why we need you!

<h2>Where to Order Post-Kickstarter Campaign: </h2>
<p>The lightweight, ultra-thin, 100% upcycled, and tear- and moisture-resistant Scrubba weightless wallet has already helped hundreds of travellers and sport-enthusiasts by reducing weight and bulkiness during physical activity. We want to ensure that as many people as possible are able to experience this freedom, which is why we're excited to continue supply of the weightless wallet via our global (<a href=""http://www.thescrubba.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thescrubba.com</a>) and Australian (<a href=""http://www.thescrubba.com.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thescrubba.com.au</a>) websites. </p>
<p>As our upcycled manufacturing method leaves us with a high quantity of the green fabric that makes up our Scrubba wash bag, the weightless wallet is currently <strong>only </strong>available in traditional Scrubba green across our websites. </p>
<p>Any future orders should be placed via our online stores. Shipping will continue from Australia and shipping times will therefore vary depending on your location (please see our websites for more details). </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Now shipping!</h3>
<p>We are pleased to announce that we are now fulfilling orders for the Scrubba weightless wallet.  We will be processing orders on a weekly basis and the default colour for the wallet will be the bright green colour.  We also have a limited amount of white wallets in stock and we expect to have a limited amount of black wallets in stock in mid-December (though hopefully earlier).  <strong><i>Should you wish to choose one or more white wallets or black wallets (bearing in mind the shipping delay), please email sam@thescrubba.com straight after making your pledge with your colour preference.  </i></strong>Colour selections will be based on a first-in first-served basis and if the colour is no longer available, a green wallet will be sent </p>

<h3>The Scrubba Story</h3>
<p>When patent attorney Ash Newland travelled to Africa to climb Mt Kilimanjaro in 2010, he was faced with the harsh reality of quickly and efficiently washing his clothes on-the-go without carrying heavy washing equipment or harming the environment. The concept of the Scrubba wash bag was born, giving rise to an ongoing commitment to develop products that are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Lightweight </li>
<li>Multi-functional</li>
<li>Durable and of high-quality</li>
<li>Environmentally-conscious</li>
<li>Compact</li>

<h3>RFID Protection </h3>
<p>To reduce weight and keep the wallet as streamlined as possible for sports' enthusiasts and hikers, RFID protection is offered via the use of separate, lightweight sleeves. Made from flexible, durable aluminium, the sleeves not only add a little style to the weightless wallet, but are highly practical. Fitting up to two cards each, you can simply insert the sleeves into the weightless wallet as desired – perfect for on-the-go travellers – or remove them when additional bulk and security are unwanted or unnecessary – great for those tough workout sessions. The sleeves weigh around 1.5g (0.05oz) each and measure 9 x 6cm (3.5 x 2.4”), enabling them to fit snugly inside the wallet while adding only minimal weight and bulk. </p>

<h3>Colour Selections: </h3>
<p>The weightless wallet is available in green, black and white, although the last two colours will be subject to limited availability. This is because our commitment to create a product that has been 100% upcycled from excess material leaves us with a higher proportion of the vibrant green fabric that makes up our famous Scrubba wash bag. Although we will always strive to deliver on colour preference, backers should note that the white and black colours are in limited supply and cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Scrubba weightless wallet has recently seen great success on Kickstarter, where it reached its goal within only 2.5 hours of its campaign launch. As we are already fully funded, all current pledges will act as a pre-order for guaranteed product and will further support our commitment to help both people and the planet experience the positive effects of exercise and activity. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Promise</h3>
<p>The Scrubba weightless wallet is our third product to be successfully crowdfunded and follows our well-known Scrubba W pack (2015) and Scrubba wash bag (2012) campaigns. The success of our former projects, coupled with our dedication to honesty and transparency in all our endeavours, leaves us wholly confident that all promises for this campaign will be promptly and efficiently delivered. As we are repurposing excess material from an existing product line, we have all the required materials ready to go and therefore do not anticipate any complications. Nevertheless, any potential delays will be swiftly communicated and managed, with a detailed action plan provided at first opportunity.   </p>

The Scrubba Story
When patent attorney Ash Newland travelled to Africa to climb Mt Kilimanjaro in 2010, he was faced with the harsh reality of quickly and efficiently washing his clothes on-the-go without carrying heavy washing equipment or harming the environment. The concept of the Scrubba wash bag was born, giving rise to an ongoing commitment to develop products that are: 

Lightweight 
Multi-functional
Durable and of high-quality
Environmentally-conscious
Compact

Our latest innovation, the Scrubba weightless wallet, is so important to us because it embodies these high standards and aligns perfectly with our core company values.

Constructed from durable 40 denier nylon fabric lined with polyurethane 
Sweat- and water-resistant
Compatible with all common currencies and fits up to 12 cards
Available with optional RFID-blocking sleeves


This means that the weightless wallet: 

Prevents sweaty and wet money
Fits easily in tight travel and active wear pockets
Avoids wallet bulge
Can easily and safely carry all your monetary essentials

As we are already fully funded, all current pledges will act as a pre-order for guaranteed product and will further support our commitment to help both people and the planet experience the positive effects of exercise and activity. 

Our Promise
The Scrubba weightless wallet is our third product to be successfully crowdfunded and follows our well-known Scrubba W pack (2015) and Scrubba wash bag (2012) campaigns. The success of our former projects, coupled with our dedication to honesty and transparency in all our endeavours, leaves us wholly confident that all promises for this campaign will be promptly and efficiently delivered. As we are repurposing excess material from an existing product line, we have all the required materials ready to go and therefore do not anticipate any complications. Nevertheless, any potential delays will be swiftly communicated and managed, with a detailed action plan provided at first opportunity.   

Other Ways You Can Help
Even if the weightless wallet isn't for you, we still value your input and appreciate your support. That's why we'd love you to:

<p>Locus Timepieces essentially designed a new class of minimalist watches. We innovated a change in time that we want the world to see. We noticed that most minimalist watches look exactly the same which inspired us to make a minimalist watch like no other. Why would you want to fit in when you have the opportunity to stand out?  We present to you ""The Legacy"".  Everyone creates their own legacy no matter how big or small.  When creating a legacy you must live in the present learn from the past and prepare for the future.</p>

<p>Our team consists of recent college graduates specializing in Engineering, Finance and Fashion. While extensively researching the minimalist watch market we came to a conclusion that not many designs are offered. We didn't let the current trend be our guide, instead we let our creativity and determination differentiate us from our competitors. We want to be that difference you're looking for. After working on the sole design for almost a year, we finally have a watch we are excited to show the world. We're very eager to launch our watch brand and bring the world new designs that will make you stand out.</p>

<p><b>HOW WE DO IT</b></p>
<ul><li>
<i>Supply Chain -</i> Thanks to our direct to consumer approach and our great relationship with our manufacturer,  we're able to provide high quality watches at an affordable price.  We skip all the retail markups so that means more savings for our supporters. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<i>Design -</i> Our team of designers, engineers and quality control specialists work around the clock to make all of this possible.  This consisted of traveling to multiple places and getting feedback from other designers. Connecting with engineers to perfect our design, and ensuring that all the materials being used are exceeding our expectations.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<i>High Quality</i><b> - </b>All of our watches are carefully manufactured until perfected. A strong 316L stainless steel watch bezel provides tremendous durability to all our watches. Followed by our very reliable Japanese Miyota GL10 movement (used in high end Citizen watches) along with our high quality straps, we are very confident with the quality of our timepieces.</li></ul>
<ul><li>
<i>Manufacturer - </i>Our manufacturer controls production in strict accordance with ISO9001 Quality Management System in order to ensure that every product is in line with international testing standards.  Quality is our main goal and we don't cut any corners to achieve it.</li></ul>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/198/347/2e8b857358d41fe39b0cd3c6cd178c12_original.jpg?v=1452905794&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=97fc1494fb9d2a1783215a88a80bcfd1"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>We want to prove that an affordable watch can be a high quality product without breaking the bank.  Our watches guarantee luxury affordability and high quality.  This is what the consumer demands and this is why we are providing it to you.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/066/762/0ca023e03b36d153f3758421c5a2b251_original.jpg?v=1449939116&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=42315c5d78651e407d3744a20662f4ea"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>In our design we captured a significant idea. Time is controlled by no one and also has no boundaries besides the ones we place our self. This is why we created something different. We broke out of the boundaries normally seen in minimalist watches.  Art can be interpreted in many ways each interpretation based on your lifestyle.  This timepiece is our work of art. </p>

<p>We want to design a whole collection of watches for our supporters. Our goal is to make a strong impact in the minimalist watch market..

<p>While in the process of creating numerous prototypes we were already creating a buzz.  We explored many options when it comes to materials, size and colors.  Experimenting and perfecting our timepiece's to what we present to you today.  People would always compliment and ask ""What kind of watch is that?"".  It's unlike other watches so its meant to catch your eye. </p>

<p>As you may have noticed, our logo is not on the face of the watch. We believe it isn't essential to the design.  In fact, the sole design will become recognized because of it. The logo is engraved on the left side of the watch case as well as the back of the watch.</p>

</div><p></p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>Our main challenge is spreading the word to help raise the capital needed to fund our first purchase order. Although there is always the risk of manufacturer delays, we are very confident that all watches will be shipped out no later than June 2016. We have a great relationship with our manufacturer and if any problems do arise we promise to keep everyone updated.</p><br/></div>","Locus Timepieces essentially designed a new class of minimalist watches. We innovated a change in time that we want the world to see. We noticed that most minimalist watches look exactly the same which inspired us to make a minimalist watch like no other. Why would you want to fit in when you have the opportunity to stand out?  We present to you ""The Legacy"".  Everyone creates their own legacy no matter how big or small.  When creating a legacy you must live in the present learn from the past and prepare for the future.




Our team consists of recent college graduates specializing in Engineering, Finance and Fashion. While extensively researching the minimalist watch market we came to a conclusion that not many designs are offered. We didn't let the current trend be our guide, instead we let our creativity and determination differentiate us from our competitors. We want to be that difference you're looking for. After working on the sole design for almost a year, we finally have a watch we are excited to show the world. We're very eager to launch our watch brand and bring the world new designs that will make you stand out.




HOW WE DO IT

Supply Chain - Thanks to our direct to consumer approach and our great relationship with our manufacturer,  we're able to provide high quality watches at an affordable price.  We skip all the retail markups so that means more savings for our supporters. 

Design - Our team of designers, engineers and quality control specialists work around the clock to make all of this possible.  This consisted of traveling to multiple places and getting feedback from other designers. Connecting with engineers to perfect our design, and ensuring that all the materials being used are exceeding our expectations.

High Quality - All of our watches are carefully manufactured until perfected. A strong 316L stainless steel watch bezel provides tremendous durability to all our watches. Followed by our very reliable Japanese Miyota GL10 movement (used in high end Citizen watches) along with our high quality straps, we are very confident with the quality of our timepieces.

Manufacturer - Our manufacturer controls production in strict accordance with ISO9001 Quality Management System in order to ensure that every product is in line with international testing standards.  Quality is our main goal and we don't cut any corners to achieve it.


We want to prove that an affordable watch can be a high quality product without breaking the bank.  Our watches guarantee luxury affordability and high quality.  This is what the consumer demands and this is why we are providing it to you.


In our design we captured a significant idea. Time is controlled by no one and also has no boundaries besides the ones we place our self. This is why we created something different. We broke out of the boundaries normally seen in minimalist watches.  Art can be interpreted in many ways each interpretation based on your lifestyle.  This timepiece is our work of art. 






No matter where you are in the world, always remember time can only be told by you!  You are the one that decides what you do with your time. You are the one that determines whether your time was used wisely. 










We want to design a whole collection of watches for our supporters. Our goal is to make a strong impact in the minimalist watch market.. Together we can change the watch industry through our innovated designs.  In order for us to bring this watch to your hands we need to raise the capital needed to fund our first purchase order.  We strongly believe that this is attainable with your help.  Please help us by sharing our project on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram etc..  Anything helps!  Thank you.


 ""There are an awful lot of so-called minimalist watches on the market but, truth be told, they are all remarkably similar from a visual perspective and many men will want to stand out from the crowd a little and that’s definitely what a Locus Watch will let you do."" - Leo Davie -owner of The Coolector.


While in the process of creating numerous prototypes we were already creating a buzz.  We explored many options when it comes to materials, size and colors.  Experimenting and perfecting our timepiece's to what we present to you today.  People would always compliment and ask ""What kind of watch is that?"".  It's unlike other watches so its meant to catch your eye. 


As you may have noticed, our logo is not on the face of the watch. We believe it isn't essential to the design.  In fact, the sole design will become recognized because of it. The logo is engraved on the left side of the watch case as well as the back of the watch.
With time comes change and with change came Locus.

<p>Le sentiment de confort prime toujours, car nos vêtements sont coupés pour de vraies femmes ; ils ne reflètent donc pas des statistiques établies en matière de tailles ni les silhouettes des stars des défilés.  </p>
<p>Les femmes que vous avez vues dans notre clip ne sont pas des mannequins professionnels. Comme vous, elles occupent un emploi, font carrière, ont des convictions religieuses, une famille et des hobbies.  </p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 38px;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/239278/files/20131203072733-AZIRA_crowdfunding_launch_event_photos_-_people-1.jpg?1386084453"" src="""" style=""""/></p>DES VÊTEMENTS FABRIQUÉS LÀ OÙ LES FEMMES ONT BESOIN D’UN EMPLOI  <br/><p></p>
<p>Chaque vêtement AZIRA est fabriqué par des femmes qui travaillent dans de bonnes conditions et à qui on assure un revenu équitable.  </p>
<p>À Casablanca, nos collections sont produites dans un atelier qui embauche des mères isolées qui ont très peu d’opportunités d’emploi.  </p>
<p>À Bruxelles, nous collaborons avec Mulieris, un atelier qui aide les femmes en difficulté et leur apprend un nouveau métier. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/229199/files/20131128043410-mulieris_Brussels_working_conditions.jpg?1385642050"" src="""" style=""width: 569px; height: 379px;""/></p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 15px;"">Photo: Mulieris team, Brussels </span></p><p></p><p><b></b></p><h1></h1><h1></h1><h1></h1><h2>UNE MINI-COLLECTION EXCLUSIVE ET TEMPORAIRE</h2>

It is no secret that today’s fashion industry exploits women, both those who make clothes and who wear them.   We have been building a real alternative to the fashion industry since 2008.  Our own island of ethical, judgment-free fashion created for women of different colors, different faiths and different sizes.We are not alone – we are proud to be a part of a global movement for independent fashion. You too can join this movement. Invest in our next collection to support our mission of making the fashion industry more ethical. Create more sustainable jobs for women who need them the most, and help us stand up to objectification and misrepresentation of women. And spread the word through Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest!DESIGNED FOR REAL WOMENAZIRA clothes are designed to serve you.  They will follow your mood, show what you want to show and keep hidden what you don’t.  In our clothes you can feel cozy or strong, playful or fierce as your mood takes you – all in one day. And you will always, always be comfortable because we build our clothes around real women’s figures – not the average size statistics, and not the boyish forms of teenage runway stars. All the women you saw in our video are not professional models – they have jobs and careers just like yours, education and religious beliefs, families and hobbies.MADE WHEREVER WOMEN NEED JOBS Every AZIRA garment is made by women who work in good conditions and earn a fair pay. In Casablanca, our collections are produced at a workshop that hires single mothers, who have very few job opportunities. In Brussels, we work with Mulieris, an atelier that helps women in difficult circumstances to learn a new profession.Photo: Mulieris team, BrusselsEXCLUSIVE MINI-COLLECTION, LIMITED TIME ONLYTo thank you for your support, we’ve prepared several exceptional, never-to-be-repeated pieces just for this crowdfunding mini-collection. The amazing Evening Dress will only be available in Sensuous Red through this campaign, and the fabulous Dragon Dress will be available in Rosé. Tunics, turbans and pants will have Indiegogo-exclusive details in Old Silver.  Every item will proudly bear the crowdfunding-exclusive THANK YOU tag.To show our gratitude for your support, we will add a gift to each package.PERK DESCRIPTIONS

MOUVEMENT MONDIAL POUR UNE MODE SANS PRÉJUGÉS
Ce n’est un secret pour personne : l’industrie de la mode actuelle exploite les femmes, celles qui fabriquent les vêtements comme celles qui les portent.    
Depuis 2008, nous proposons une véritable alternative à l’industrie de la mode, une mode éthique sans préjugés qui est destinée à des femmes de couleur, de croyance et de taille différentes.
Et nous ne sommes pas les seuls ! Nous sommes fiers de faire partie d’un mouvement mondial en faveur d’une mode indépendante.   
Vous pouvez vous joindre à ce mouvement.   
Investissez dans notre prochaine collection pour nous aider à réaliser notre objectif et rendre  l’industrie de la mode plus éthique.   
Aidez-nous à créer des emplois durables pour les femmes pour qui c’est une nécessité et à lutter contre l’exploitation et la sous-représentation des femmes. 
Diffusez ce message sur Facebook, Twitter et Pinterest ! 
DES VÊTEMENTS CRÉÉS POUR DE VRAIES FEMMES
Les vêtements AZIRA ont été spécialement créés pour vous servir. Ils s’adaptent à vos humeurs et ne dévoilent que ce que vous désirez révéler. Ils vous accompagnent au gré de vos envies, tout au long de la journée.    
Le sentiment de confort prime toujours, car nos vêtements sont coupés pour de vraies femmes ; ils ne reflètent donc pas des statistiques établies en matière de tailles ni les silhouettes des stars des défilés.  
Les femmes que vous avez vues dans notre clip ne sont pas des mannequins professionnels. Comme vous, elles occupent un emploi, font carrière, ont des convictions religieuses, une famille et des hobbies.  DES VÊTEMENTS FABRIQUÉS LÀ OÙ LES FEMMES ONT BESOIN D’UN EMPLOI  
Chaque vêtement AZIRA est fabriqué par des femmes qui travaillent dans de bonnes conditions et à qui on assure un revenu équitable.  
À Casablanca, nos collections sont produites dans un atelier qui embauche des mères isolées qui ont très peu d’opportunités d’emploi.  
À Bruxelles, nous collaborons avec Mulieris, un atelier qui aide les femmes en difficulté et leur apprend un nouveau métier. Photo: Mulieris team, Brussels UNE MINI-COLLECTION EXCLUSIVE ET TEMPORAIRE

Athlete 2.0 Evolve 
campaign

Welcome to the world of Athlete2.0
A cutting edge brand that represents the evolution of the
modern day Athlete.Besides our innovative clothing and equipment line,
 the key things that set us apart from other sports brands are -
*Our in-house media production department which promotes our Athletes and products on our You tube channel Athlete 2.0 Television.
& 
*We
also act as a sponsorship agent
 for the athletes we work with ensuring they
retain 100% of the funding we source. 





Who we are

After 6 months of dedicated training in MMA 2 years ago I had lost over
30 kgs (66pounds) and started feeling like a 2.0 version of myself.
 It was a life changing experience that inspired me to realise that I needed to make my dream a reality.



Through the motivation from training in the
sport I loved and through the desire to wear fashion I liked instead of what
just fitted I decided to create Athlete 2.0


Athlete 2.0 wants to educate the masses about the invaluable
benefits of making Martial Arts part of your life and correct the common
misconceptions and negativity that surrounds the sport, as well as help mainstream
it.


What We Need 




Unlike other sports the majority of Martial Arts receive
little to no funding from Government bodies…
but we know what the Athletes need and with your help 

we can provide it.



If we reach our goal of €15,000 we can 

Get printing equipment and supplies
rent a premises for our print studio
Release our first official range of stock
Get a pop up event shop and a point of sale

Build a profesional website
Get a van
 by hiring 1 full time staff member Athlete 2.0 can avail of Government  staff grants which allows  us to  hire 4 more much needed staff members before December .
2 of these team members will be working as sponsorship agents for our sponsored athletes, This will help with much needed financial support from sponsorship deals for training and travelling. Athletes will always receive 100% of all sponsorship deals.



                         With €25,000 we can-
Purchase professional filming, equipment which will enable us to film movie      quality productions and get more martial arts viewing on TV for you, the fans.
 






If you all share our vision 
and we are lucky enough to be super successful with our campaign and raise
 €50,000 or more 

We can-

Open our second Print studio in Poland where we can, from start to finish manufacture most of our garments to the highest quality in an EU standard work environment which will help deliver garments to the customer at an affordable price.Having a base in Poland will allow us to start supporting all the European Athletes that have been contacting us over the last year but have not been able to do so up to this point due to our limited resources this will also open up all European events by road which we can be present at with our film crew and event shop.
How we say thanks:)Check out our rewards list in the side bar!!!Be the first to own the official 1st Athlete 2.0 clothing and equipment collection,  
We also have autographed memorabilia, Event/Seminar tickets, Holidays, Training weekends  and Unique once in a lifetime opportunities.

<p>One of the Findster secrets is in its <b>innovative wireless communication system</b>, used to establish communication between the pet/child module and its guardian/parent module (or the pet/child module and the Base Station).<br/><br/>
Our proprietary wireless protocol allows you to obtain <strong>communication range of 0.62 miles (1 km) </strong>between both modules, thereby eliminating the need to send the coordinates through a cellular connection. In this way, we have removed the required monthly fees that are intrinsic to other GPS tracking systems on the market.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><p><br/></p>

<br/>Findster ecosystem</span></h3><br/><p></p><p>The Parent/Guardian module serves as a gateway between your smartphone and the Child or Pet module, enabling a long-range bi-directional communication between both.</p><p>All the controls and displays of data are centralised in the Findster App. </p><p>The third element of the Findster ecosystem is the basestation.</p><p>The <strong>basestation</strong> can be placed, for example, in your home, powering a <strong>communication range of 1.24 miles (​​2 km)</strong>. The basestation wireless communication uses the same proprietary protocol of the child/pet module. However, because it has no restrictions in terms of battery consumption or size, we were able to design a system with a range <b>2</b><strong>x greater than the wearable module.</strong></p><p>And because each <strong>basestation has a wi-fi connection</strong>, even if the child or pet leaves your home’s security zone, when approaching another basestation it is automatically re-connected with your smartphone through the Cloud—always guaranteeing your privacy. </p><p>Only you and those who you have authorised can have access to data modules.<br/><br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1462376570/20140514183134-Ecosystem_1_gokmn8.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p><p></p><h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;color: #1b9dbb;""><br/>Security zone</span></h2><br/><p>When the Child or Pet leaves the defined security zone, the application sends an immediate alert. If they are in the coverage radius of the Parent/Guardian module, the module’s location continues to be monitored. When the connectivity between the two modules is lost, the last detected position is saved. If this happens, the Findster ecosystem activates the alert mode and all other modules start searching for the lost Child or Pet. When they find it, they send its current location through the cloud to the Parent/Guardian’s smartphone App.<br/><br/>
Furthermore, a module defined as lost will always look for a link to a basestation with  an internet connection. When getting this connection, it will send its current position to your smartphone and other people authorized to access the module’s location.<br/><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/575177/files/20140512170012-Findster_App.gif?1399939212"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;color: #1b9dbb;""><br/>Technical Specifications</span></h2><p></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/580490/files/20140514183909-Specs_hi.png?1400117949"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><h3 style=""font-weight: normal;"">

Can other unauthorised modules be connected to my kid's/pet's module?</strong></p><p>Not unless they are explicitly allowed (monitoring group).</p><p>Other guardian modules could serve as a gateway for sending data to the web service, but only if there is authorization from the owner of these modules.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>5. How is the connection established between Findsters?

This connection only needs to be done once.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>6. Why are two modules necessary?</strong></p><p>The Findster’s secret sauce is its proprietary RF technology that allows for two modules to communicate in a range of up to 1km. If we were using just one module to communicate with the smartphone – as a Bluetooth tracker does – then we would only be able to achieve 50m of communication range.</p><p>We weren’t satisfied with that range, so we’ve developed our own technology.

What happens if the smartphone is too far from the guardian's module?</strong></p><p>With Findster you will never be able to lose your guardian modules anywhere. What Findster does is it constantly monitors the distance between the smartphone and the guardian module. If this distance is greater than a preset threshold, an alert is posted on the module (sound/vibration) and on the smartphone.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>8. When my kid is missing, will other Findster users be able to help?</strong></p><p>Yes, because Findster has networking capabilities. A missing child can transmit its location anonymously using other Findsters. The information is relayed through our web service to its destiny.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>9. What is the purpose of the basestation?</strong></p><p>The basestation (BS) allows you to extend the coverage area of the Findster network. Since the base station does not have the same power and space constraints of the Findster modules, we were able to devise a more powerful version of our RF communication system.</p><p>Moreover, being Wi-Fi enabled, it establishes a link between the base station and all your Findster modules, even if you’re outside of your home.

but actually… Indiegogo wasn’t.
We’ve been selected to be one of the first campaigns to stay on
Indiegogo in the “Forever Funding” section.
You can find our permanent campaign Here ! and tell your friends and
family that they can still buy their Findster.
Any doubts, contact us!

There's one fear that everyone can relate to: the panic of losing a loved one.

Chills, stomach-churning, racing heart, sweat and heavy breathing… Can you imagine not knowing where your child is? Or your pet?You don't have to. Not ever again.We present you FINDSTER.
Thanks to Findster, you are always connected to the ones you love.
Findster tracks your loved one's activity and location, keeping you informed on their health and safety.Findster KidsFindster PetsFINDSTER has been featured on:Findster is a new and innovative GPS tracking system working towards the safety of your loved ones, finding them whenever you want to. Compared to other systems on the market, Findster is free of charge. There are no monthly fees! That's what makes us your best choice.There are two primary devices, one for you and one for your loved one. They are wirelessly connected to each other, and all you need to make them work is the Findster's App on your smartphone.You can follow their moves in your pre-selected area and you receive alerts whenever they leave that space. With Findster you can also see how much time your child takes getting from home to school, or from school to a friend's house.You can increase the range and capabilities of Findster.
To increase the ubiquity and range of Findster, there is a third device to the system, a base station that can be placed in strategic points, expanding your connection area and protecting who you care about even when you're not home.Imagine your workplace is far from your residence. As long as you have a base station at home, you can continuously track your child or your pet in your neighborhood. Being away from home doesn't mean you can't be connected to those dearest to you.
And if your neighborhood joins Findster by getting additional base stations, the protection zone becomes even bigger. These base stations can also be placed in schools and playgrounds to increase the area of protection. The larger the Findster’s web, the more omnipresent you become.But there's more... What about your Pet?Have you ever wished you knew what your pet has been doing while you were out?Has he been resting or trying to eat your furniture?Findster has an activity tracker option that allows you to know its activity levels during the day.

Make sure you are everywhere.
Support Findster now and be one of the first to have it, at a very (very) limited special price. Once you get it, you can use it forever WITHOUT MONTHLY FEES!A short term step for a long term peace of mind.FeaturesFindster’s Secret SauceThe Findster ecosystem is composed of 5 components: Portable charger, Parent/Guardian module, Child or Pet module, Basestation and smartphone App (Android and iOS).The Child or Pet module was designed specifically to be comfortable when applied yet secure. This module includes a high-precision GPS system and a 3-axis accelerometer that enables the detection of whether the child fell or, in the pet’s case, what his activity index was throughout the day.Wireless communication system
One of the Findster secrets is in its innovative wireless communication system, used to establish communication between the pet/child module and its guardian/parent module (or the pet/child module and the Base Station).
Our proprietary wireless protocol allows you to obtain communication range of 0.62 miles (1 km) between both modules, thereby eliminating the need to send the coordinates through a cellular connection. In this way, we have removed the required monthly fees that are intrinsic to other GPS tracking systems on the market.

Findster ecosystemThe Parent/Guardian module serves as a gateway between your smartphone and the Child or Pet module, enabling a long-range bi-directional communication between both.All the controls and displays of data are centralised in the Findster App. The third element of the Findster ecosystem is the basestation.The basestation can be placed, for example, in your home, powering a communication range of 1.24 miles (​​2 km). The basestation wireless communication uses the same proprietary protocol of the child/pet module. However, because it has no restrictions in terms of battery consumption or size, we were able to design a system with a range 2x greater than the wearable module.And because each basestation has a wi-fi connection, even if the child or pet leaves your home’s security zone, when approaching another basestation it is automatically re-connected with your smartphone through the Cloud—always guaranteeing your privacy. Only you and those who you have authorised can have access to data modules.Security zoneWhen the Child or Pet leaves the defined security zone, the application sends an immediate alert. If they are in the coverage radius of the Parent/Guardian module, the module’s location continues to be monitored. When the connectivity between the two modules is lost, the last detected position is saved. If this happens, the Findster ecosystem activates the alert mode and all other modules start searching for the lost Child or Pet. When they find it, they send its current location through the cloud to the Parent/Guardian’s smartphone App.
Furthermore, a module defined as lost will always look for a link to a basestation with  an internet connection. When getting this connection, it will send its current position to your smartphone and other people authorized to access the module’s location.Technical Specifications

<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Hey indiegogo!</strong></h3>
<p class=""p1"">We (James &amp; Zach) are here to introduce you to a new era in affordable, fashionable eyewear.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Being very active in the local outdoor &amp; action sports communities, we were sick of spending a fortune on designer sunglasses just to lose or break them in a few months.  After researching the current eyewear market and the stronghold one company has on it, we decided to put the wheels in motion to create the coolest most affordable eyewear one could buy.</p>

<p class=""p1"">James is an avid Mountain biker, snowboarder and sponsored wakeboarder. So over the years he has had his fair share of mishaps with expensive glasses. “It makes me sick to think of how much money I have spent over the years,” said James. “I swear I would get a new pair of glasses and within a month they were either broken or lost”. Whether he shattered them on a trail, or dropped them in the lake this is what sparked him to create diode optics. James currently resides in Park City Utah where he can walk out his back porch and hit the slopes or the trails. <a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/profile/1854420144"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""s1""><br/></span></a></p>

<p class=""p1"">Zach’s love for fashion started at a young age, growing up he was always up on the latest and greatest trends and styles. Zach worked as a manager and buyer for multiple retail shops in the Salt Lake Valley. But he always had to “ball on a budget” said Zach, “finding cool good looking sunglasses that didn’t require you to take out a loan was always such a challenge, so when James came to me with this idea It was a no brainer”. Zach being an avid snowboarder, and wakeboarder, as well had definitely lost his fair share of glasses over the years.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Together we are on a mission to change the way the world thinks about eye wear.  We will strive to design the best fitting, best looking, affordable sunglasses we can. So thru vigorous trial and error we have come up with what we call “Affordable Fashion for your face”.</p>

</p>
<p><b>Fact</b></p>
<p>Paying full price is not only unnecessary, it's 
overrated.

Resale shops and secondhand stores are all the rage now- even Macklemore
 raps about shopping sprees in thrift stores being quite an enjoyable 
experience. </p>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<p><b>Quest For A (GOOD) Bargain</b></p>
<p>Discount chains do offer good price points on some of their 
merchandise, but often times, a lot of the things they sell are damaged 
or just not very high in quality. The household names of bargain 
retailers buy leftover inventory in bulk from major retailers with the 
goal of filling their shelves and being able to advertise a lesser price
 than the ""manufacturer's suggested retail price."" As a result, the 
quality control is not great and you end up spending hours sorting 
through the racks looking for the hidden gem. This is a key 
differentiating factor with Leaux Standards- I do the quality control 
for you. </p>
<p><b>No Headaches Required</b></p>
<p>The best part of it all? You don't have to sort through hundreds of 
sketchy things in the wrong size hoping you score one good thing to make
 it all worthwhile. I do the hard part and pass the savings on to you. 
Literally. Another key thing is- well, the website! The known names in 
bargain business don't offer a website. You HAVE to go into their store 
and BEG the shopping gods of the universe to send you something good. 
Not to mention sites like EBay and Craigslist where you can find all 
kind of goodies...posted by people who want all kinds of money and feel 
attached to their things and the money they lost buying those things, so
 they want you to make up the difference. I mean, these sites are 
decent... if you have a supreme amount of patience. Really, as far as 
any of those avenues go, it requires a great deal of patience. Patience 
to track down what you're looking for, try to negotiate a fair price and
 avoid feeling jipped. Patience to stay up all night trying to win only 
to be outbid in the last 3 seconds. Leaux Standards is going to change 
that...and make it easy for those of you whose patience has run out.</p>
<p><b>What Does It All Mean?</b></p>
<p> Leaux Standards is an online store committed to bringing the very 
best deals to one place, for one price. The items sold will go for about
 50% less than the original retail price! I can afford to do this by 
purchasing items at a very reasonable price, from the right places, 
during the right season. Because I can score a deal on it, you will 
score a deal on it when you buy it from me. In my own closet, I would 
often pull out things 6 months old, unworn, tags still attached. I 
couldn't return these things because too much time had passed. Selling 
through existing sites was ok, but required too much work and too much 
time. I knew there had to be a better way. </p>
<p><b>I've Got The Goods</b></p>
<p> It's become apparent that I just love to buy quality stuff at a fair
 price. I don't know how to resist a legit deal. And that is to the 
benefit of the people. I search all over town for awesome deals on 
really cool things and make them available for a majorly reduced price 
through Leaux Standards. As of now, the online store offers fashion 
products. An array of clothes, shoes and accessories will be available 
for men and women. Most of these things will be major name brands, other things will be from independent, up and coming labels or local 
vendors/designers in the LA area. Because these featured brands are 
still being established, you get access to their products at a lower 
price point while the buzz around their brand is still building. 
Everything on the site will be hand picked by me and will be 100% 
authentic. </p>
<p><b>Ask, And You Shall Receive</b></p>
<p> A very exciting element of the site will be the Stylist component, 
which will allow shoppers on the site to request stylist services for an
 upcoming event, personal shopping, wardrobe analysis and a variety of 
other things. Most people frustrated with their appearance and clothing 
options don't even think to hire a stylist for themselves. It's a luxury
 usually reserved for celebs and wealthy people. That's what people 
assume anyway, because stylists and personal shoppers normally charge a 
very steep rate for their services. However, in keeping with the Leaux 
Standards culture, it will be surprisingly affordable. Big presentation 
coming up? Reunion? Date? Wedding? Closet needs a makeover or an update?
 Get the expert help you need and still have money left to shop! This is
 something I really love to do. I like the challenge, and I care about 
making people feel good about themselves. I have dressed celebrity 
clients for red carpets/major premiers as well as just to refresh their 
wardrobe for the season; I've created totally new wardrobes for doctors,
 lawyers, and jet setters who didn't have time to do it themselves. I've
 hand selected looks for new moms and college graduates who didn't even 
know where to start. The one thing everyone has in common? They just 
need a little expert advice on figuring out what makes them look their 
best. And now I can help you, too. </p>
<p><b>Operation: Check Off Checklist</b></p>
<p> My many years of experience in the retail and styling industry gives
 me an advantage on selecting things that are not just trendy and 
current, but pairing these pieces with items that are classic and can be
 worn for years to come. The site is just about ready to launch and I 
have clients ready to buy. I just need additional funds to get LS off 
the ground. Your contribution will help in the following ways: Paying 
for promo materials such as stickers and tags, finishing the last and 
final stage of the website as well as any maintenance required after its
 initial launch, and most importantly- acquiring as much merchandise as I can
 to ensure I'm able to get as much product as possible onto the site and
 into your hands in time for the holidays. Don't spend more money than 
you have to on coworkers, in-laws, or even yourself! Everyone on your 
list can get something without making you go bankrupt.</p>
<p> I'm thrilled to be bringing this tool to others like me who enjoy 
the finer things in life, but don't want to overpay for anything. Join 
me in revolutionizing the way people shop.</p>

price point while the buzz around their brand is still building. 
Everything on the site will be hand picked by me and will be 100% 
authentic. 
Ask, And You Shall Receive
 A very exciting element of the site will be the Stylist component, 
which will allow shoppers on the site to request stylist services for an
 upcoming event, personal shopping, wardrobe analysis and a variety of 
other things. Most people frustrated with their appearance and clothing 
options don't even think to hire a stylist for themselves. It's a luxury
 usually reserved for celebs and wealthy people. That's what people 
assume anyway, because stylists and personal shoppers normally charge a 
very steep rate for their services. However, in keeping with the Leaux 
Standards culture, it will be surprisingly affordable. Big presentation 
coming up? Reunion? Date? Wedding? Closet needs a makeover or an update?
 Get the expert help you need and still have money left to shop! This is
 something I really love to do. I like the challenge, and I care about 
making people feel good about themselves. I have dressed celebrity 
clients for red carpets/major premiers as well as just to refresh their 
wardrobe for the season; I've created totally new wardrobes for doctors,
 lawyers, and jet setters who didn't have time to do it themselves. I've
 hand selected looks for new moms and college graduates who didn't even 
know where to start. The one thing everyone has in common? They just 
need a little expert advice on figuring out what makes them look their 
best. And now I can help you, too. 
Operation: Check Off Checklist
 My many years of experience in the retail and styling industry gives
 me an advantage on selecting things that are not just trendy and 
current, but pairing these pieces with items that are classic and can be
 worn for years to come. The site is just about ready to launch and I 
have clients ready to buy. I just need additional funds to get LS off 
the ground. Your contribution will help in the following ways: Paying 
for promo materials such as stickers and tags, finishing the last and 
final stage of the website as well as any maintenance required after its
 initial launch, and most importantly- acquiring as much merchandise as I can
 to ensure I'm able to get as much product as possible onto the site and
 into your hands in time for the holidays. Don't spend more money than 
you have to on coworkers, in-laws, or even yourself! Everyone on your 
list can get something without making you go bankrupt.
 I'm thrilled to be bringing this tool to others like me who enjoy 
the finer things in life, but don't want to overpay for anything. Join 
me in revolutionizing the way people shop.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
<p>Fashion used to be about feeling good, something you could rely on to be affordable and innovative. Today that's rarely the case. Online flash sales are making it impossible for young designers to innovate with quality merchandise and retails stores have cookie cutter clothes which make all of us look exactly alike.  The independence fashion could afford you has become a sought-after novelty. In short:  <strong>customers are suffering and designers are suffering.  We're here to fix that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We want to fix that and do fashion differently: make clothes only when the customers back it - and reward those customers with wholesale prices.  This is Vicaire NY's Be Our Buyer program.</strong></p>

KickSpike will revolutionize footwear with its retractable metal spikes, that are easily deployed by the click of a button on the back of a shoe/boot.

How the idea was born


Being a Class A Golf Course Superintendent for 14 years, I knew how damaging and costly spikes (even soft spikes) were to Golf Greens. The answer came to me in a dream: retractable metal spikes you click on and off with your foot at the back of the shoe, without bending over. I met with the President of the United States Golf Association and he dubbed KickSpike the ""best invention since the sand wedge.""
More uses than we could have imagined


After being on CBC's Dragon's Den, we were flooded with requests for the shoes/boots to help prevent slips and falls in many different industries (oil, postal, military). We were also approached by people with mobility issues and the elderly: for them, a fall can be fatal. Bending over to put on anti-slip footwear products can also be very difficult. 









Our next stage


KickSpike is now ready to be manufactured. After four years, we have three international patents, a top technical team and several of the largest shoe and boot companies in North America waiting for our product.



We Need You!
We need a final $250 000 to get the production moulds and materials (metal and plastic) to produce the first batch of KickSpike Mechanisms. We need your help!
Be a Part of the Shoe Revolution!




Help us get our product out to the world! Help us prevent injuries from slips and falls!  Help the environment by taking spikes off the golf greens! Be a part of the shoe revolution! Donate and/or spread the word today! 

What You will receive!
As part of the shoe revolution, you will receive (depending on the level of contribution) either the first pair of shoes or boots from the first production run, an invite to our launch party, a ""Shoe Revolution"" t-shirt, private video thank you and emails, invitation to the inaugural golf tourney.
All funds will go towards the last push to get the mechanisms off the assembly line - to get the plastics and metals we need to fill the moulds to make Kickspike a reality!

<p>MANSSION was created because we were dissatisfied with the selection of jewelry. Everything we found was either terrible quality and clunky, or far too expensive and not fashionable. There was nothing that resonated with what we truly wanted: high-quality, stylish jewelry at a reasonable price. We spent over 18 months finding and working with the top suppliers in the industry to create completely custom designs that are made to look great and last...without the big name-brand markups.</p>
<p>While designing our first collections, we decided to focus on these three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using the highest quality materials, hand finished to perfection</li>
<li>Designing fashionable, unique, and fully custom pieces</li>
<li>Offering our one of a kind, top quality bracelets at fair prices</li>

<p>Our jewelry designs are custom, created by us and only for MANSSION.

Wear MANSSION when you want to stand out, when you want to add a subtle accent to an all-black outfit, or stack different pieces to make a bold statement.

</div></div>","MANSSION was created because we were dissatisfied with the selection of jewelry. Everything we found was either terrible quality and clunky, or far too expensive and not fashionable. There was nothing that resonated with what we truly wanted: high-quality, stylish jewelry at a reasonable price. We spent over 18 months finding and working with the top suppliers in the industry to create completely custom designs that are made to look great and last...without the big name-brand markups.
While designing our first collections, we decided to focus on these three things:

Using the highest quality materials, hand finished to perfection
Designing fashionable, unique, and fully custom pieces
Offering our one of a kind, top quality bracelets at fair prices


 





 

For our first set of collections, we are offering ELEVEN pieces to choose from:
The ""Melbourne"" Bracelet in: Stardust, Sunrise, & Rosewood colorways.

 
The ""Uptown"" Cuff in: 925 Sterling Silver, 18k Gold, Rose Gold, & Gunmetal.

 
The ""Porter"" Bracelet in: 925 Sterling Silver, 18k Gold, Rose Gold, & Gunmetal.

 


After spending over 18 months working with more than 20 suppliers, we have found and developed great relationships with the industry’s leading manufacturers. Our 925 sterling silver pieces are NOT silver plated. They are full 925 sterling silver from start to finish, with an extra protective rhodium plating for ultimate durability. Comparable products from competitors would cost you over $700! Our 18k gold, rose gold, and black rhodium pieces feature an industry leading 2-micron plating plus a specially formulated coating for extra tarnish protection. We paid attention to every detail to ensure our products will last.

With a no-tie lace design, you can easily slip the shoe on or off — no time wasted.A discrete YKK zipper closure system located on the side of the shoe provides function and style. We blend our modified slip-on system with modern materials to maintain a stylish boot silhouette. 
 
 We believe that feeling amazing starts with where you stand. The sneaker-boots are lighter than most, which makes activities easier and less strenuous on your feet. The boot shell consists of 4-way stretch fabric for an extra comfortable fit.An optimal contoured cushioning design evenly distributes the weight of your body, relieving the pressure and shock of each step. A sculpted insole provides support on the arch and heel for all-day comfort. Your feet won’t ache after a long day, bringing you a new level of comfort. 

  The sneaker-boots are engineered with highly durable materials such as military-grade Cordura and Japanese armor. The toe boxes of the shoes have TPR mudguard protection, the tips of the recycled plastic cords are dipped in rubber to prevent fraying ends, and the soles feature a unique water flushing pattern with a sawtooth profile to provide excellent grip in all types of weather. 
 
 The sneaker-boots are 100% waterproof and snowproof. Not only is the entire shoe welded TPR for weather protection, but it also keeps water out with a waterproof YKK zipper. The weatherproof material also has insulating layer keeping your toes warm from the cold and snow. 
 
 Our footwear is man-made with ethical manufacturing procedures. We strive to limit our carbon footprint to help preserve the environment. We use materials like recycled plastic and 100% natural, biodegradable rubber to create our shoes. We are also vegan-friendly — we do not use animal by-products.

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Do I have to be an entrepreneur to wear a BizyTee?</b></p>
<p>No, people of all ages and work situations love wearing them because they like the messages and the quality of the Tees, and it’s a great way to support entrepreneurs around the world.</p>
<p><b>Do I have to be a shy entrepreneur to order a BizyTee?  </b></p>
<p>No you don’t have to be a shy entrepreneur to get value from your BizyTee, but if you are, they sure do help.  </p>
<p><b>Who are BizyTees for?  </b></p>
<p>BizyTee’s are perfect for: Business Professionals, Business Owners, Aspiring Entrepreneurs, Start-ups, Anyone Who Works For Themselves, Artists, Writers, Freelancers, Sales Professionals, B2B Sales Staff and anyone who dreams of starting a business.  Or for people who just want to show their support for entrepreneurs around the world.  We’ve even had kids and teens ask for their own BizyTee.</p>
<p><b>Do you have Fitted Shirts for Women?</b></p>
<p>Yes!  We understand that many women won’t wear a T-Shirt that doesn’t fit them the way they like, so we made sure to have fitted shirts available in a nice range of colors with all of the BizyTee designs.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How Do I Pick My Design, Color, And Size?</b></p>
<p>We will send you a form to fill out at the end of the campaign to get your shirt size, color, design and style.  Our sizes are S, M, L, XL, 2XL for both cuts and 3XL or the Mens/Unisex Style shirt.</p>
<p><b>Can I buy them as a gift for someone else?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely!  They make great gifts for friends, family, and business associates.  We’ve found that kids love them as much as adults do!</p>
<p><b>Can BizyTees get me more clients?</b></p>
<p>BizyTees are designed to get attention from people who love to talk about business.  Our experience is that they are a great conversation opener but it’s up to you and your business to get new clients so your results may vary.  What we’ve done is create a high quality entrepreneur themed Tee that we believe you will enjoy wearing and will get you the right kind of attention.</p>
<p><b>Are BizyTees available in stores?</b></p>
<p>Currently they are only available via INDIEGOGO</p>
<p><b>What material is BizyTees made out of?</b></p>
<p>BizyTees are made of 100% ring-spun, pre-shrunk cotton which is super strong, soft, and light-weight.  Heather colors contain 10% polyester.</p>

<p><b>What is micro-lending exactly?</b></p>
<p>Micro-lending is the lending of very small amounts of money at low to no interest, especially to a start-up company or self-employed person.</p>
<p>Many people in smaller communities who want to start or grow their business, don’t always have access to the small amounts of capital.  These Micro-loans give them access to the capital they need.</p>
<p><b>How much do you contribute to micro-lending for each shirt?</b></p>
<p>For every BizyTee T-Shirt you and your friends purchase,  we contribute a dollar to help entrepreneurs around the world fight poverty through micro lending.</p>
<p>These micro-loans range from $25-$500 dollars and make a huge impact in the lives of the entrepreneur, their children and their community.</p>
<p><b>Is BizyTee a Charity?</b></p>
<p>No, BizyTees is a for-profit company with a core goal to support entrepreneurs around the globe through our products and micro-lending.  Our core goal helps us support entrepreneurs around the world without having to do any fundraising.</p>
<p><b>Why Crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p>The INDIEGOGO community is made up of entrepreneurs and business minded individuals with a desire to solve problems, meet the needs of their customers and develop amazing brands, and that’s why we are here. </p>
<p>I believe that by providing all of you with a great working solution in the form of a high quality durable Tee that speaks volumes and works as hard as you do, you will reward us with your support. </p>

Many people in smaller communities who want to start or grow their business, don’t always have access to the small amounts of capital.  These Micro-loans give them access to the capital they need.
How much do you contribute to micro-lending for each shirt?
For every BizyTee T-Shirt you and your friends purchase,  we contribute a dollar to help entrepreneurs around the world fight poverty through micro lending.
These micro-loans range from $25-$500 dollars and make a huge impact in the lives of the entrepreneur, their children and their community.
Is BizyTee a Charity?
No, BizyTees is a for-profit company with a core goal to support entrepreneurs around the globe through our products and micro-lending.  Our core goal helps us support entrepreneurs around the world without having to do any fundraising.
Why Crowdfunding?
The INDIEGOGO community is made up of entrepreneurs and business minded individuals with a desire to solve problems, meet the needs of their customers and develop amazing brands, and that’s why we are here. 
I believe that by providing all of you with a great working solution in the form of a high quality durable Tee that speaks volumes and works as hard as you do, you will reward us with your support.",9.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my Brothers &amp; Sisters,<br/>My name is Golden Skyy, a local Native American Fashion Designer based in San Antonio, TX. My background in Fashion Design came at an early age from watching my parents create lovely clothing. I also have my Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts from The Art Insitute of San Antonio, TX. Our brand stands in the name of Love, Positive Growth, Unity, Joy &amp; Abundance for all walks of life in this world. <br/>After submitting my application to Vancouver, BC Fashion Week, We received an email of acceptance.  I knew, in my heart, I was given an opportunity of a lifetime to showcase as a designer my true talent and passion. I am also an educator and believe in giving back to the future generation Fashion Designers of Tomorrow. We lead by example and fallow our hearts in hopes this campaign can make dreams come true. After my stepfather passed away from stage four cancer, I have embarked on a mission to carry my parents legacy! <br/>Each contribution will put me one step closer to have the ability to take my brand internationally finally! This will be the first time after receiving awards, merits, recognitions, national competitions &amp; achievements that we finally have the opportunity to showcase in one of the worlds most talked about Fashion Weeks! Globals Designers, Global Media, Global Marketing, Global Magazines, Global Buyers, A-List Celebrities, and so much more! </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Value of this campaign is worth more than words can say. I walk in the light of Positive Energy and always remember my roots and where I came from. Growing up, we didn't have much, but we had each other, a home, food on the table &amp; LOVE. I am the only child and was adopted by my grandparents. I am the ONLY one sibling in the entire family that has completed college and did something with there life. I want to make my parents proud and for them to know they raised a successful son.</p>
<p>A Golden Success of Achievements: 2018 Uniform 300 Tricentennial- representing citizens of San Antonio/ 2017 WomansWeardesigner of the Year- San Antonio Fashion Awards/ 2017 Best Graduating Collection- The Art Institute of San Antonio/ 2017 Hashtag American Magazine- Fashion Article by Mia Isabella/2017 The Salon Professional Acadamey- Guest Judge/ 2016 Offical Nominee Fashion Artist of The Year- San Antonio Fashion Awards/ 2011 Humane Society of the United States Cool Vs Cruel Competition/ 2011 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette- Fashion News Article &amp; so much more! </p>
<p>I took a risk in my career, knowing that only a select few would make it like a professional designer. I knew in my heart that I have a gift, and each day that I work towards my goals, I have noticed that my passion for creating clothes is just the surface. I follow closely in my parent's footsteps to ensure the quality and craftsmanship of my work can meet the masses! I have used my success to inspire like-minded individuals who wish to pursue a career in Fashion Design. I am also an educator and public figure in my community and promote LOVE, ABUNDANCE, PEACE, UNITY &amp; JOY to all walks of life. I firmly believe my gift is to spread, LOVE around the world with my GIFT.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One thing in life is that we are all here for one another, and we only get one shot. Each year that has passed, in my career, I have grown to embrace the thrill of change, and I put my best foot forward and lead by POSITIVE example, love, passion &amp; integrity. We are grateful for any contribution that anyone can give during this time. I have been designing for over 20 years, and feel that the time has come for me to take the stage and show the world what the Golden Skyy Brand has to offer.</p>

I am the ONLY one sibling in the entire family that has completed college and did something with there life. I want to make my parents proud and for them to know they raised a successful son.
A Golden Success of Achievements: 2018 Uniform 300 Tricentennial- representing citizens of San Antonio/ 2017 WomansWeardesigner of the Year- San Antonio Fashion Awards/ 2017 Best Graduating Collection- The Art Institute of San Antonio/ 2017 Hashtag American Magazine- Fashion Article by Mia Isabella/2017 The Salon Professional Acadamey- Guest Judge/ 2016 Offical Nominee Fashion Artist of The Year- San Antonio Fashion Awards/ 2011 Humane Society of the United States Cool Vs Cruel Competition/ 2011 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette- Fashion News Article & so much more! 
I took a risk in my career, knowing that only a select few would make it like a professional designer. I knew in my heart that I have a gift, and each day that I work towards my goals, I have noticed that my passion for creating clothes is just the surface. I follow closely in my parent's footsteps to ensure the quality and craftsmanship of my work can meet the masses! I have used my success to inspire like-minded individuals who wish to pursue a career in Fashion Design. I am also an educator and public figure in my community and promote LOVE, ABUNDANCE, PEACE, UNITY & JOY to all walks of life. I firmly believe my gift is to spread, LOVE around the world with my GIFT.

Risks & Challenges
One thing in life is that we are all here for one another, and we only get one shot. Each year that has passed, in my career, I have grown to embrace the thrill of change, and I put my best foot forward and lead by POSITIVE example, love, passion & integrity. We are grateful for any contribution that anyone can give during this time. I have been designing for over 20 years, and feel that the time has come for me to take the stage and show the world what the Golden Skyy Brand has to offer.
Love has no Gender, Love has no Race, Love has no Religion, Love has no Boarders, We won't live forever, but our actions will last for eternity!
LOVE WINS

<h3>Let's start with the basics</h3>
<p>I'm Stefanie Alther, a 24 year old passionate girl based out of Lincoln, Nebraska with a heart the size of the sun for Bali, and a vision to create an impact to bring an end to baby abandonment.  </p>
<p>After living in Bali in 2015 and being a part of a team that started a baby drop box program, I returned to Nebraska searching for what the next step in this movement could be. I then had the vision to create an organization based in America that would be able to link the women and babies in Bali with women and babies here in the states. Thus, the creation of KNOCK ON.</p>
<p>KNOCK ON is an online baby boutique of products that are handmade in Bali from traditional batik fabric.</p>

<p>These products serve a larger purpose. The proceeds from each purchase will go to support the care of babies who have been given another chance on life through the baby drop box program.

By choosing the FOCX Everyday Wallet, you choose to make an outstanding appearance.Smart, flexible and minimal.Our aspiration is to make an outstandingly designed product which is useful, long-lasting, and provides a clever solution to your everyday needs. When creating The FOCX Everyday Wallet, we focused on a minimalist design which, at the same time, would simplify the handling of your cards. It took us many sleepless nights and tough testing to find this new design combining leather components, an elastic band and grosgrain. By launching the FOCX Everyday Wallet, we want to bring a change to the world of wallets.All good things.We believe in the uniqueness of each wallet. Therefore, we leave our FOCX Everyday Wallets with a natural finish, giving each piece its own unique look. FOCX Wallets are made from natural cattle hide leather, a wax finish and the toughest and most flexible elastic band available. As a special modern technology feature, we have installed an NFS Tag 215 with more than 500 bytes so that, along with your cards and cash, you can even carry your data with you. The FOCX New Wallet is slim and stylish and yet long-lasting. Why not replace your unwieldy old wallet with a FOCX Everyday Wallet and show off with it?!  All the materials used – elastic band, grosgrain and high-quality yarn – have undergone tough testing. At times, several dozens of bands an yarns from both German and international manufacturers crowded our workshop. Price did not matter, since we were determined to use only highest-quality materials for our FOCX Everyday Wallets. And we managed!   Setting a new trend.NFC Technology offers a great deal of interesting possibilities and we believe that this technology will expand over all kinds of areas in the near future. By using it for our FOCX Everyday Wallets, we want to directly participate in setting this trend. Applying NFC technology to wallets seems an obvious step, all the more since it allows for an ideal combination of smartphones and wallets. We always carry both of them with us, thus creating an almost unlimited number of possibilities: whether when muting the volume of your smartphone in a meeting, giving WiFi access to your friends or transferring your contact data to your customers, colleagues or flirts – everything is possible and easy as 1, 2, 3 by simply touching your wallet.FOCX™ is shielded.It goes without saying that we have made sure to consider your safety, too. The FOCX blocking card is a state-of-the-art feature, making your bank card data and other confidential digital information a hundred percent safe with the FOCX Wallet. However, in order for you to be able to continue using your card for near-field communication as previously, only the front of your FOCX Wallet is shielded. By inserting your card into the reverse compartment, you can go on opening doors, making payments or doing whatever you like with it. By using the wallet, you decide on how you use your data.",28.0,0,"3 Campaigns

has to be quite large. After that, restocking smaller quantity is no problem, but we would like to be able to give our customers, (and funders), at least 15 – 20 different models to

My friend
has a shoe size of EU45, (the equivalent to female US14/UK11), and she
complained on how hard it is to find nice looking womens shoes or boots that
actually looks like they are in this seasons style. In her own words: “For once I wish I could find a decent pair

Well...  We can do this because:
None of us are quitting our daytime jobs the first year, so all profits are going back into the business.  Even if we double back what we get from you, there are still a tiny amount of profit left so we can slowely expand the selection of models. The first year we don't have expences for storage facillities or even an accountant. Friends and family are pulling their weight. 
You will be our first customers, and it is far more important for us to make you super happy and hopefully spread the word, than making a profit from day one! Convinced?   
Our Models
Most of the
time we probably won’t be able to offer the exact same retail model as you would find in most
mainstream shoe stores, but the models that are designed by the factories will
be very similar in style. 
Winter Is Coming...Our main focus we be on boots for the fall/winter season. We will also include some shoes intended for the Holydays.
Booties with low, mid and high heels
Knee high boots with low-, mid- and high heels
""Over the knee"" boots - mainly with low heels.
Our video gives a good idea of what to come, (although the ""over the knee"" boots aren't represented there).What Happens If Our Goal Isn't Reached?
We’ve asked to
be founded €32000. That is a lot of money, and what happens if our goal isn’t
reached? The answer is that the store will open, but we have to make the
initial selection of models smaller.What if we get more than we've asked for? Simple! The store will be filled with more models to choose from.

Beyond the immeasurable cost in terms of human dignity, lack of sanitation spreads diseases like diarrhea that kill 1,000 Indian children a day, and causes over $53 billion in economic loss due to lost productivity and medical expenses.  <br/><br/>The picture is grim .... and given the magnitude of the problem, solving India’s sanitation crisis has not been easy.

Beyond the immeasurable cost in terms of human dignity, lack of sanitation spreads diseases like diarrhea that kill 1,000 Indian children a day, and causes over $53 billion in economic loss due to lost productivity and medical expenses.  The picture is grim .... and given the magnitude of the problem, solving India’s sanitation crisis has not been easy. India is still last in the World Diarrhea Rankings; way behind other countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh.The Power Of CricketOur biggest problems can be conquered only by our biggest passions and in India, few things hold as much promise and power as does cricket. Cricket is called the Beautiful Game and captures the imagination and emotions of more than a billion people in India shaping their ideals and dreams. 

Sapna Kumari and the national finalists of the NBY's WASH Star sanitation-themed singing contest raise their respective awards at the grand finale in Bettiah, Bihar.
What Is Potty CricketPotty Cricket is a social enterprise that will sell professional quality cricket gear to cricket lovers across the world at regular retail prices, as a way to raise money for innovative sanitation development efforts. We will also have Special Edition gear on sale, autographed by leading Indian cricketers -- a once in a lifetime opportunity to get your hands on rare, signed equipment. When you buy gear from Potty Cricket, about 40% of the price, which otherwise would have been the profit margin for sporting goods retailers, will go to support proven high-impact sanitation and hygiene programs. All of our gear will be sourced directly, at deeply discounted prices, from leading manufacturers of professional quality cricket equipment in India. Professional cricket players will serve as consultants and ensure that we procure only the highest quality products.  

Disclaimer: Actual Potty Cricket gear will look different (better) than the above samples.

Supporting The Nirmal Bharat Yatra ShortfallOur Fundraising Goal As our launch project, we are raising USD 120,000 for the Nirmal Bharat Yatra -- a massive campaign on sanitation and hygiene that took the form of a village carnival and travelled 2,000kms across rural India from Wardha, Maharashtra to Bettiah, Bihar over 50 days this past autumn. The spread the word on the importance of using toilets, washing hands with soap, and breaking the taboo of speaking about menstrual hygiene by using interactive cricket-based games and captivating stage performances, as well as targeted workshops. The Yatra was organized by WASH United ,an international non-profit, and Quicksand Design Studio, an Indian design firm. You can find more information on their ambitious future plans here.

Children line up to play the NBY's cricket-based sanitation-themed games in Gorakhpur. 
The Yatra was a massive logistical exercise that involved a crew of 470, 40 trucks, 10 buses traveling across Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, & Bihar - the states most badly afflicted by poor sanitation coverage in India. WASH United raised USD 2.3 million for the Nirmal Bharat Yatra from donors that included the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Swiss Agency For Development & Cooperation, GIZ, WSSCC, Arghyam & several others.

Help cover the cost of production/delivery the men's NO.2 (US SIZE 8-13)
Help cover the cost of production/delivery of the unisex NO.3 (US WMS 5-11 and US MNS 8-13) 
Help cover the cost of production/delivery of the women's ASHLEY (US SIZE 5-11)
Help cover the cost of opening the outsole and insole molds for the performance NO.2...the Elite, which is scheduled to launch late 2014.
All orders placed on the NO.2 will be delivered regardless if goal is reached due to the regulations of the factory I work with

WHAT'S THE STORY BEHIND THE COLORWAY AND NAMES?When creating the Q.DESIGNS line, I wanted the initial shoe to be named ""NO.2"" because as an artist, creations usually originate with you sketching with the NO.2 pencil...that's the foundation.  We later graduate to pen, marker, pastels, etc.  So the staple colorway of the Q.DESIGNS footwear line will always be Tuscan: brown, black, and pink.  Brown represents the wood of the pencil, black for the lead, and pink for the eraser tip.  As for the women's line, the initial style begins with Ashley because of my fiancé's middle name.  The next style will follow the alphabetical order with B.WHAT ARE THE GOALS?

<p><b>Story</b>. The Companion Bag story is simple just like the bag. We wanted to create a jack of all trades bag. A bag big enough and rugged enough to withstand the most adventurous weekend in the woods, yet stylish and professional enough to bring to the office and impress your coworkers on Monday. Sure, there are tons of bags out there that could possibly do that, but they require a kidney to pay for them. The Companion bag is the perfect combination of value and quality, the best part is you can buy one and keep all your  internal accoutrements.</p>

Whether it's tangible like Sasquatch, or something more magical like love, friendship or a career move, Fang & Hoof's high-quality stylish goods will help you capture whatever you're hunting—or at least make you look damn good doing it. 
At home in the woods or in the city. 
Story. The Companion Bag story is simple just like the bag. We wanted to create a jack of all trades bag. A bag big enough and rugged enough to withstand the most adventurous weekend in the woods, yet stylish and professional enough to bring to the office and impress your coworkers on Monday. Sure, there are tons of bags out there that could possibly do that, but they require a kidney to pay for them. The Companion bag is the perfect combination of value and quality, the best part is you can buy one and keep all your  internal accoutrements.

Color. The Companion Bag comes in two zipper colors. Choose the classic black zipper Companion Bag or for those who want a pop of color, choose the limited edition neon green zipper Companion Bag.  Both are equally awesome, but it will change the way we will think about you when you place your order.

<p><strong>Erick Jansen:</strong></p>
<p>Erick has been in the Bike and Outdoor industry (bike/snow) for the last 26 years, both in retail and in product management.  Half of a dozen of those years were spent at Specialized Bicycles Components, and prior to that, 3 years at TREK Bicycle in Madison, Wisconsin.  He has been an independent Sales Rep for the last 4 years representing some of the larger bike and snow brands.  Somewhere in between, he has been able to squeeze in 12 Years as a firefighter.   When he’s not out spinning on his bike, or paddling out to catch a wave, Erick loves to swim, run, cook, work with wood, and ultimately anything that involves creativity and using his hands.  Finally, as Erick will attest, none of those accomplishments can measure up to his greatest passion of all, being a father to his 8 year old daughter, his inspiration for <strong>The Freeloader</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nathan Jones:</strong></p>
<p>Nathan Jones has been a firefighter for the last seven years. He spent most of a decade looking for a wife in California, while completing college, working in online event ticket sales and being a partner in a restaurant in Seattle, WA. Subsequently, Nathan returned to Austin, TX where his entrepreneurial spirit continued. He opened and operated a coffee shop, a real estate company in Central Texas and a bottled water company in California. He also spent time trapped in a cubicle at Dell computers as his soul was quietly leaking from every orifice.  He enjoys surfing (a hobby that was considerably easier to engage in while living in Santa Cruz, CA), rock climbing and playing pick-up soccer on any afternoon of any day where life, work and fatherhood don’t take a front seat. </p>

<p> <strong>Inspiration</strong></p>
<p>The idea for the Freeloader came to Erick when walking the streets of Paris with his daughter when she was 4 years old.  She was amazingly capable of using her own two feet but there was a definite wall that would be hit and the day would be over.  Thus their Paris nights were restricted to just Paris days.  However, it wasn't until a hike on the Ocean Trail in the Redwood forests of Muir Woods that he came up with a solution to his problem.  What if there was a lightweight, portable pack that could be carried for one of those “in an emergency, just break glass” moments. Something that would not get in the way, but in the event it was needed, a fold down seat could be provided and the adventure could be extended. </p>
<p><em><strong>in the beginning.....</strong></em> </p>
<p><strong><img alt=""drawingtable2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/640608/pictures/full/20130130150201-vid_pics_6__4_.JPG?1359586928"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>

<p> <strong>Solving Our Problems</strong></p>
<p>        In this passionate pursuit we frequently came up against the reality that current child carriers are grossly insufficient.  They are incapable of carrying an adequate amount of weight as well as being exceptionally bulky. With our extended, combined history in outdoor gear sales and safety management, we set out to create a new child carrier that would far exceed the carrying capacity of the current market, while creating a smaller, much more portable, more compact pack.  It was clear that in the mountain bike, rock climbing and surfing industry new technologies were being created that produced stronger materials at lighter weights. </p>
<p>         First it was necessary that we conquer the safety factor.  We looked at three different types of harnesses. We began, of course, by investigating the harnesses that current child carriers utilize (the padded cage), next we looked into current parachute technology figuring that there was, literally, no better harness system than this,  (except for maybe) and finally the current Formula One car harnesses.   Having these three designs to work from, we came up with a simple, yet extremely safe, five-point harness.</p>
<p>          Second, we set out to identify materials that were lightweight and extremely strong.  After spending nine months testing different metals, alloys, plastics and combinations of components, we finally settled on a system that weighed less than three pounds, yet had a failure rate of no less than one hundred pounds.  As a rule, we wanted the folding seat to be able to withstand weight that exceeded what a normal human being could carry (running backs not withstanding).</p>
<p><em><strong>....""who says bigger is better!""</strong></em></p>
<p> <img alt=""side profile"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/640692/pictures/full/20130130163309-side_profile.jpg?1359592400"" src="""" style=""width: 358px; height: 358px;""/>      </p>
<p> </p>
<p>         Third, we needed these components to be small, <em><strong>portable and carry-on compatible</strong></em> (arguably the fourth requirement was that this thing look super fly, hip, sleek, something that Hollywood types and professional athletes would wear regardless of whether they even had kids it looked so good, BUT our American gentleman idealism and culture would never allow us to admit to this being a factor). This proved to be the most difficult because we were aware of the fact we had a product that exceeded anything that was currently on the market.  But it needed to fit the high standards we initially set out to achieve.  </p>
<p>         After four generations of prototypes, completely rebuilding bags, being sewn and scrapped and sewn again, multiple frames and hinges manufactured, injection molded components made, endless reams of fabric, spools of string, webs of nylon, we excluded everything that was not explicitly beneficial and <em><strong>The Freeloader</strong> </em>was born. </p>
<p> <em><strong>And finally, after hundreds of hours, the Freeloader was Born!</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""papasam"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/640594/pictures/full/20130130145529-vid_pics__3_.JPG?1359586538"" src="""" style=""width: 542px; height: 325px;""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Passion in Principle</strong></p>
<p>We subscribe to the theory set forth by <em><strong>Rudolph Steiner</strong> </em>that children need to develop their bodies in order to develop their mind.  He breaks down the development of children into three phases.  The first phase culminates around the age of six or seven or when the adult teeth come in. “The … approach to early childhood education is largely experiential, imitative and sensory-based… Outdoor play… providing children with experiences of nature, weather and the seasons of the year”<strong>*</strong>. The Freeloader is another tool in the toolbox to achieve this sensory based experience for our children.  It allows for life to be lived out there, where the rubber meets the road, where the birds talk and the wind sings. </p>
<p>We haven’t created a new product for parents to carry their children around everywhere.  On the contrary, it is important to the child’s development that they push their bodies and allow their muscles to grow.  <strong>The Freeloader</strong> has been created so that 1/4 mile into the walk down the sandy beach toward the lighthouse you don’t have to turn around.  Rather, you just have to drop the seat and give your child a break.  Then, simply let them down and continue on your journey.  No longer do we have to turn back.  The destination is now achievable.  Discover the lighthouse.   But even more importantly, let your child have the satisfaction of reaching a goal and experiencing life.   </p>
<p><em><strong>who says ""three's a crowd?!""</strong></em></p>
<p><img alt=""sarahkids"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/640591/pictures/full/20130130145340-vid_pics__2_.JPG?1359586426"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> <strong>Why the $30K</strong> </p>
<p>After a year of navigating regulations, securing <strong>provisional patents</strong>, R&amp;D, agreeing on multiple designs, breaking numerous sewing machines, dealing with welders and CAD engineers, rapid prototyping, and kids as test dummies  we need $30,000 to get us to the next phase of development.   </p>
<p>By reaching the $30,000 goal we will be able to pay for all of the tooling, machining and manufacturing costs for every separate component.  This in turn will allow us to create the pack at the best price with the best (optimal, premium?) performance. If we are unable to reach our entire funding goal, the process will be slowed exceptionally.  The tooling and machining costs alone would have to be taken on individually over the course of a few years, driving up the estimated retail price and delaying the release of The Freeloader. </p>

<p><strong>The 21st Century Child Carrier</strong></p>
<p> <strong>What you are doing by helping….</strong></p>
<p>After a year, we have finally designed, tested, retested (ad nauseam), and at last arrived at our destination.  A child carrier that is extremely safe, looks awesome (we did design the seat after mid to late 60's Schwinn Orange Crate bikes after all), feels and wears comfortably, whether loaded with a <em><strong>Freeloader</strong></em> or not. It's lightweight and can withstand loads vastly exceeding those that are even possible to carry. </p>
<p>By backing this campaign now you have the option of getting one of the first <em><strong>Freeloaders</strong></em> or just helping to ensure it is available down the road when you choose to reproduce and have a little freeloader of your very own.  </p>
<p>You are also helping to bring into existence a novel new product.  One that will allow parents to go farther, kids to experience more and the family nucleus to simultaneously broaden their horizons.  This isn’t your parent’s child carrier. </p>
<p><em><strong>Please, please</strong></em>, get the word out there to any of your friends and family you think might be able to benefit from the Freeloader, or if you just think we're cute, sweet and funny.  It helps more than you know to even ""like"" us on Facebook or follow us on Twitter.  Let alone, to blast an email out about what we think to be an amazing, new child carrier.  All contributions, be it time or money are greatly appreciated.  We couldn't make this adventure happen without the willingness of our backers and we will be forever grateful to all of y'all. </p>

A little about the Creator's of the FreeLoader.  
The Creators of the Freeloader are passionate fathers who love to take their children on adventures of the world.  
....a seat built for a freeloader
 
Erick Jansen:
Erick has been in the Bike and Outdoor industry (bike/snow) for the last 26 years, both in retail and in product management.  Half of a dozen of those years were spent at Specialized Bicycles Components, and prior to that, 3 years at TREK Bicycle in Madison, Wisconsin.  He has been an independent Sales Rep for the last 4 years representing some of the larger bike and snow brands.  Somewhere in between, he has been able to squeeze in 12 Years as a firefighter.   When he’s not out spinning on his bike, or paddling out to catch a wave, Erick loves to swim, run, cook, work with wood, and ultimately anything that involves creativity and using his hands.  Finally, as Erick will attest, none of those accomplishments can measure up to his greatest passion of all, being a father to his 8 year old daughter, his inspiration for The Freeloader
Nathan Jones:
Nathan Jones has been a firefighter for the last seven years. He spent most of a decade looking for a wife in California, while completing college, working in online event ticket sales and being a partner in a restaurant in Seattle, WA. Subsequently, Nathan returned to Austin, TX where his entrepreneurial spirit continued. He opened and operated a coffee shop, a real estate company in Central Texas and a bottled water company in California. He also spent time trapped in a cubicle at Dell computers as his soul was quietly leaking from every orifice.  He enjoys surfing (a hobby that was considerably easier to engage in while living in Santa Cruz, CA), rock climbing and playing pick-up soccer on any afternoon of any day where life, work and fatherhood don’t take a front seat. 
ready for whatever comes your way.....
 
 Inspiration
The idea for the Freeloader came to Erick when walking the streets of Paris with his daughter when she was 4 years old.  She was amazingly capable of using her own two feet but there was a definite wall that would be hit and the day would be over.  Thus their Paris nights were restricted to just Paris days.  However, it wasn't until a hike on the Ocean Trail in the Redwood forests of Muir Woods that he came up with a solution to his problem.  What if there was a lightweight, portable pack that could be carried for one of those “in an emergency, just break glass” moments. Something that would not get in the way, but in the event it was needed, a fold down seat could be provided and the adventure could be extended. 
in the beginning..... 

 
 Solving Our Problems
        In this passionate pursuit we frequently came up against the reality that current child carriers are grossly insufficient.  They are incapable of carrying an adequate amount of weight as well as being exceptionally bulky. With our extended, combined history in outdoor gear sales and safety management, we set out to create a new child carrier that would far exceed the carrying capacity of the current market, while creating a smaller, much more portable, more compact pack.  It was clear that in the mountain bike, rock climbing and surfing industry new technologies were being created that produced stronger materials at lighter weights. 
         First it was necessary that we conquer the safety factor.  We looked at three different types of harnesses. We began, of course, by investigating the harnesses that current child carriers utilize (the padded cage), next we looked into current parachute technology figuring that there was, literally, no better harness system than this,  (except for maybe) and finally the current Formula One car harnesses.   Having these three designs to work from, we came up with a simple, yet extremely safe, five-point harness.
          Second, we set out to identify materials that were lightweight and extremely strong.  After spending nine months testing different metals, alloys, plastics and combinations of components, we finally settled on a system that weighed less than three pounds, yet had a failure rate of no less than one hundred pounds.  As a rule, we wanted the folding seat to be able to withstand weight that exceeded what a normal human being could carry (running backs not withstanding).
....""who says bigger is better!""
       
 
         Third, we needed these components to be small, portable and carry-on compatible (arguably the fourth requirement was that this thing look super fly, hip, sleek, something that Hollywood types and professional athletes would wear regardless of whether they even had kids it looked so good, BUT our American gentleman idealism and culture would never allow us to admit to this being a factor). This proved to be the most difficult because we were aware of the fact we had a product that exceeded anything that was currently on the market.  But it needed to fit the high standards we initially set out to achieve.  
         After four generations of prototypes, completely rebuilding bags, being sewn and scrapped and sewn again, multiple frames and hinges manufactured, injection molded components made, endless reams of fabric, spools of string, webs of nylon, we excluded everything that was not explicitly beneficial and The Freeloader was born. 
 And finally, after hundreds of hours, the Freeloader was Born!

Passion in Principle
We subscribe to the theory set forth by Rudolph Steiner that children need to develop their bodies in order to develop their mind.  He breaks down the development of children into three phases.  The first phase culminates around the age of six or seven or when the adult teeth come in. “The … approach to early childhood education is largely experiential, imitative and sensory-based… Outdoor play… providing children with experiences of nature, weather and the seasons of the year”*. The Freeloader is another tool in the toolbox to achieve this sensory based experience for our children.  It allows for life to be lived out there, where the rubber meets the road, where the birds talk and the wind sings. 
We haven’t created a new product for parents to carry their children around everywhere.  On the contrary, it is important to the child’s development that they push their bodies and allow their muscles to grow.  The Freeloader has been created so that 1/4 mile into the walk down the sandy beach toward the lighthouse you don’t have to turn around.  Rather, you just have to drop the seat and give your child a break.  Then, simply let them down and continue on your journey.  No longer do we have to turn back.  The destination is now achievable.  Discover the lighthouse.   But even more importantly, let your child have the satisfaction of reaching a goal and experiencing life.   
who says ""three's a crowd?!""

 Why the $30K 
After a year of navigating regulations, securing provisional patents, R&D, agreeing on multiple designs, breaking numerous sewing machines, dealing with welders and CAD engineers, rapid prototyping, and kids as test dummies  we need $30,000 to get us to the next phase of development.   
By reaching the $30,000 goal we will be able to pay for all of the tooling, machining and manufacturing costs for every separate component.  This in turn will allow us to create the pack at the best price with the best (optimal, premium?) performance. If we are unable to reach our entire funding goal, the process will be slowed exceptionally.  The tooling and machining costs alone would have to be taken on individually over the course of a few years, driving up the estimated retail price and delaying the release of The Freeloader. 
Production Plan
Once the $30K is raised, it will take 90-120 days for the packs to be manufactured.  During this time we will have the fold down seats manufactured locally in Central Texas.  Once all of the components have been assembled the pack will undergo a final round of inspection and then shipped to your door!  
Risks and Challenges
One of our highest priorities we had before bringing the Freeloader to the Indiegogo community was to ensure, to the best of our ability, every aspect of the production was accounted for. This would allow us to give an accurate expectation as to when the Freeloader would be delivered. We took the number of days that our vendors promised us and added 20%, allowing us a cushion, should we encounter unplanned production delays.  But like all things under the sun, nothing is permanent nor guaranteed.  We feel we have accounted for all variables but should obstacles arise we will be open and transparent, keeping our backers abreast of all pertinent information. 
PERKS for our BACKERS, the gift of giving to those that give to us

 Now our perks are not, not cool.

Second ($35 Perk) 
We here at FreeLoader HQ we dig on the soft Ts.  So we don't expect you to be any different.  This isn't going to be a 5mm thick 100% cotton, starched and scratchy and usable as a fire suppressant.  This shirt is going to fit just righteous, not pulling on your biceps or nothing.  Just form fitting, the way we know, that you know, that we know you like em.   And we'll drop some of the Aviators in too, just in case your glove box is a little light. WE WILL VERIFY SIZE AND COLOR OPTIONS PRIOR TO DELIVERY.

<p>And, finally... I'm SO excited to bring you PYSIS! </p>
<p>I hope you'll back this campaign to get a pair for yourself - or your favorite lady. :)  And, just as important: to help spread the word!!</p>
<p>It takes an enthusiastic village to get the word out about a new product and I'm so appreciative of the opportunity to share PYSIS and my story with you! </p>
<p>THANK YOU for taking the time to learn about PYSIS and be part of my journey!</p>

<h3>The Future of PYSIS</h3>
<p>We have a dream. To create an exciting new niche in the rainwear industry - a pair of overboots in every closet!</p>
<p>We're contemplating different colors and styles of overboots - a sample of the ladies ""bootie"" style is already in the works.  ...not to mention PYSIS for Men.  And who knows where we can go from there! </p>
<p>But, we believe that measured growth - and listening to our valued customers - will be the key to success.  So, your feedback will be considered and appreciated.</p>
<p>And not only do we want to bring overboots to the masses and continue the noble work of saving gorgeous shoes :)... but, we want to create jobs and be a real contributor to the economy.</p>
<p>Already, during the recession, PYSIS has contributed to the job security of so many valued consultants, advisors and professionals who have worked to make PYSIS' launch possible.  From branding, to product development, to patenting, website development and photography - it's been a pleasure to work with so many talented consultants and work to bring PYSIS to life! </p>
<p>But, the real exciting part is still ahead: When PYSIS can hire designers, developers, a sales staff and more!  We'll know we've made it when we've created a thriving business and can contribute to the economy in a substantial way.</p>

Message from our Founder
Hi!  I'm Cassandra Droogan - a New York City girl who had a New York City problem.  I like to wear the shoes I want to wear - and hate to compromise for the weather. 
I worked in corporate banking for years and always dreamed of being an entrepreneur.  So, when the recession hit and I lost my job, I realized it was go time! 
And I haven't looked back!
Over the past five years I've learned what a major effort and crazy roller coaster ride it is to design and develop a new product - patent it, brand it and secure a qualified, responsible factory to produce it.
And, finally... I'm SO excited to bring you PYSIS! 
I hope you'll back this campaign to get a pair for yourself - or your favorite lady. :)  And, just as important: to help spread the word!!
It takes an enthusiastic village to get the word out about a new product and I'm so appreciative of the opportunity to share PYSIS and my story with you! 
THANK YOU for taking the time to learn about PYSIS and be part of my journey!
Yours in Perfect Pumps, Cassandra DrooganFounder & President, PYSIS Inc.  
 
PYSIS Overboots

Brand Overview 
Whether you're headed to the office, an important lunch meeting, or a special night out...
You deserve to look and feel your best and we want you to arrive in style!  Whatever the weather. 
Have you ever tried to negotiate that huge puddle or snow mound in a pair of dress shoes?  Or needed to dress to the nines - while the weather dictates footwear in... the threes!?  Or worn heavy, bulky rain boots, while carrying shoes separately??
Well, no more!  We've created a solution.
PYSIS Overboots are galoshes (or rain boots worn OVER shoes) that can be worn over many different styles of shoes and boots to protect them from rain, slush, salt and snow.  And each pair is sold with a convenient carry bag. 
Our name is pronounced like the water sign: Pisces. It stands for ""Protect Your Shoes In Style"" and we stand for keeping you gorgeous and your shoes impeccable.
We invite you to be part of our story and help grow this exciting new brand.  With your help, PYSIS can truly become the next BIG thing!  Remember the UGGs craze??  Well, overboots have arrived!
Please back this campaign to be among the very first to own a pair of PYSIS, and spread the word so every woman (and eventually man!) who owns shoes can own proper protection. :)
Go ahead... Get Sloshed!  And always, Protect Your Shoes In Style.
 
Overboot Overview
 


Elastic Closure for adjustable fit.

Soft Patent *Polyurethane (PU) Upper for convenient collapsibility.

Bootie Construction Liner for added protection. Nylon lining.

Seams Sealed with PU tape.

Molded Rubber Cup Sole for strong seal with Upper.

 



Reinforced Insole for added strength.

Treaded Rubber Sole for traction.

 
Sizing Guidance


Small PYSIS protect fabulous shoes in sizes US 5 (Euro 35) - US 7 (Euro 37.5)*

Medium PYSIS protect fabulous shoes in sizes US 7.5 (Euro 38) - US 9 (Euro 39.5)*

Large PYSIS protect fabulous shoes in sizes US 9.5 (Euro 40) –US 11 (Euro 41.5)*

*Sizing Guidance is based on wearing PYSIS to protect your high heeled shoes. If you wear size 7/37.5 or 9/39.5 shoes and you wear primarily kitten heels or wide shoes, you might consider going up a size for your overboots. For added security, elastic can be looped around the button multipletimes. 
 
Early Testimonials
New Yorkers waited patiently for their PYSIS...

I have rain boots at work, but now I am going to have to get a shopping bag big enough to put the rain boots in when I get to Balthazar so I can wear nice shoes at the restaurant.""- P.M.
""My wife, daughter, and our baby sitter are all good prospects for your overshoes. They all have these big, heavy 5lb rubber rain boots. They are always leaving them at the wrong place. And they only need them for 15 to 30 minutes at a time. Your idea is so much smarter.""– K.O.

This is a time for us to practice entrepreneurship and social skills in the real world by working with professionals and our peers to produce high-quality products and sell them to support our school. Wet Hands Print Shop is one of those projects.  For the next few months, we will be selling top-of-the-line t-shirts that we designed in a way that represents our school and its students. We've worked with teachers from different levels to create designs that symbolize each level. We have different designs for each age, from Primary School all the way up to Middle School. However, all the designs have a few things in common. For one, all of them are printed professionally by a local business. Additionally, the images we selected for each grade are printed inside of a coat of arms to help show school spirit. </p><p>Maker Immersion Week is always a really valuable experience for us. Throughout the week, even over Zoom this year, we practice working as a team and learn about economics. We do exercises to help us understand business and sales principles, plus are educated on life skills that can help us far after our school journey is complete. </p><h3><strong>Designs:</strong></h3><p><b>Infant, Toddler, Primary:</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602778697/hh7emhyagvhu0fosut4t.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602778726/awvu3pdwgvtytppyz0ki.png"" src=""""/></p><p>These designs are focused on the Infant/Toddler/Primary levels in our school.

<p><strong> Looper arose from the question: What is good technology?</strong></p>
<p>We believe that life and technology should exist in harmony. Looper is the result of synthesizing smart technology and impeccable style.</p>
<p><strong>Design Components</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Inspired by Rings </strong>- Rings are a token of the special connection between you and your lover, family, or friend. Inspired by the shape and significance behind rings, we designed a ring-shaped crown to symbolize your connection to your valuable belongings. </li>
<li>
<strong> Seamlessly Hidden Button</strong> - To call Looper, there is a button on the face of the tassel. Tucked under the leather, the hidden button makes for a seamless design. </li>
<li>
<strong>Leather Tassels Designed for Durability</strong> - Not only is the tassel designed to be fashionable, but it is also designed to be durable. By controlling the thickness of the leather, Looper is made to withstand daily activities. Additionally, the small holes above the leather skirt keep the skirt from tearing apart.<br/> </li>
