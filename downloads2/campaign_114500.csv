<p>The Future of Masculinity is a zine project led by Next Gen Men, a small but mighty non-profit leading the conversations men &amp; boys need to have. We are champions of positive masculinities and culture change. <strong>We spread hope.</strong></p>
<p>With this zine, Next Gen Men leads you on a <strong>journey of self-reflection</strong>, an exploration of each dimension that makes up our modern, gender-informed lives — self, health, peers, culture and relationships. It’s a story about how masculinity, in all its forms, impacts people of all genders, and how those people — you, me, all of us, together  —  can reshape masculinity in turn.</p>
<p>It’s the zine we all need, with news-you-can-use and fresh views on how reimagining a <strong>plural</strong>, <strong>positive</strong>, <strong>progressive vision for masculinity</strong> can help each of us where we need it most — at home, at work, in our relationships, in our heads, and in how we engage with the turbulent world around us.</p>
<p>And you’ll get it from the horse’s mouth: from Next Gen Men’s cross-continent community, from our network of <strong>expert thought leaders</strong>, from the next generation of men themselves, and from NGM’s own in-house expertise, built-on more than a half-decade leading the conversations men &amp; boys need to have.</p>
<p>The Future of Masculinity is <strong>more than the sum of its pages.</strong> It is a combination of ink, art, ideas and inspiration for a future where men &amp; boys experience less pain and cause less harm. It’s a community-built blueprint for a better, fairer future. <i>For everyone.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Be Part of the Change </h2>
<p>We need the help of supporters like you to make the Future of Masculinity a reality.</p>
<p>Our objective, through the zine, is to create a bold, thoughtful experience capable of positively impacting every person who picks it up.</p>
<p>To make that happen, we need $5,000 to cover the printing costs of printing 1,000 issues for backers, partners, and to put out into the world! Next Gen Men will take care of the rest.</p>
<p><strong>What’s in it for you? Good question.</strong></p>
<p>There is something for everyone in our variety of perks: </p>
<ul>
<li>Receive the personal satisfaction of making an impact and the public gratitude of having <strong>your name published</strong> in our zine. </li>
<li>Get the most out of the interactive activities included in the zine with our <strong>printed copy of The Future of Masculinity</strong>. </li>

<h2>ABOUT ME, THE NOVEL AND THIS CAMPAIGN</h2>
<p>My name is Kip Pettigrew, I've been writing for as long as I can remember. I've finally decided to take my passion to the next level and publish one of my books.  <em>Pledge</em> is the first in a three book series, <em>The Guild Memoirs</em>.  I'm finishing the preparations for a Dec publish date and I am raising money to fund the paperback printing of the book.  If funding and demand is high enough I will also print hard back copies. </p>

<h2>ABOUT THE GUILD MEMOIRS:</h2>
<p>Your thoughts and opinions are not your own. For millennia human civilization has been led and influenced by secret guilds made up of individuals who, at all times, transmit their feelings and personality to the unknowing masses. They control public opinion. They are why good men die for causes they don’t believe in. They are why you feel strongly about things that should not concern you. <em>The Guild Memoirs</em> is the life story of one such telepath and how his life has affected us all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>Pledge</em></strong><strong>:</strong> Troy Williamson was a typical boy in a dysfunctional American family. That life ended the day he began telepathically influencing those around him. Unable to return home, Troy becomes a pledge of the Noreastern Guild, one of the secret societies that control regional identity and belief. As he struggles to master his abilities, Troy discovers he has gifts different even from his fellow telepaths and secrets he dare not share, even with his mentor. Troy hopes to become a guild brother and help mankind, but his power could be the biggest threat the guild has ever known.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Absolutely!</strong></p>
<p>Are you a person of worth? My guess is that you are, but as we all know, life is about overcoming obstacles and challenges that continuously push us to be better than where and who we are in an effort to become the best we can be. The process can be overwhelming and exhausting at times, which is why having a coach, cheerleader, or mentor as a  support system makes a big difference. Through my book,  I want to be that person for YOU! </p>
<p>I've spent my career as a life/fitness coach, and nutrition expert helping people just like you to improve in all areas of life. In my sessions with clients, we talk about the characteristics of a person of worth and what it means to have a purposeful belief system that includes boundaries and goals that will lead to living, intentionally.</p>
<p>Through the hard work and dedication that I've put into improving my clients' lives, I've cultivated a very successful 7 step process that digs much deeper than ""think positive"" or ""count calories"" or ""get your aerobic workouts in."" I uncover the deep, core belief system of my clients, and which we all inherit, and help them knock down the old and rebuild a new, purposeful belief system that serves them better at any stage of life.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Through my life's experiences, I've determined that:</em></strong></p>
<p><em>A woman of worth is a diamond.</em></p>
<p><em>A man of a worth is a gold nugget.</em></p>
<p><em>A teenager of worth is a diamond or a gold nugget in the making. </em></p>
<p><em>A person of worth awakes each day looking for the gifts  to open around them.</em></p>
<p><em>A person of worth takes full responsibility for their lives.  </em></p>
<p><em>A person of worth knows that they can only bring change to those things of which   they are aware. </em></p>
<p><em>A person of worth recognizes that their negative belief systems came from their childhood, circumstances and or others in their life. </em></p>
<p><em>A person of worth doesn't deny their inherited belief system, but reflects, evaluates, and acknowledges both the negative and positive belief systems.</em></p>
<p>The 7 steps process helps you be able to forgive and choose to let go so you can be free and open to create and build your own positive belief system that represents who YOU choose to be and where YOU desire to go.</p>
<p><strong>The Table of Contents for my book outline the 7 steps:</strong></p>
<p>1. Attributes of Being a Person of Worth</p>
<p>2. Uncovering Your Belief System - Tree and Roots</p>
<p>3. Building Your New Belief System - Starfish</p>
<p>4.  Importance of Boundaries and Goal Setting to create a No Fail                 Environment.</p>
<p>5. Fitness and Nutrition</p>
<p>6. Relationships - Personal and Professional - Done Right</p>
<p>7. Become the Diamond/Gold Nugget you are or one in the making</p>
<p>When you choose to back this project, you're choosing to help improve not only your own life, but those of potentially countless people.</p>
<p><strong>Steps to a successful project ie publishing my book</strong></p>
<p>I'm working with two very talented ghostwriters to complete this book project so it can be the best possible book available. It will contain information that you've never read in another self-help, inspirational book. Your donation helps to cover the ghostwriting fees as well as the cost of publishing, printing, and marketing.</p>
<p><strong>My larger vision...</strong></p>
<p>My book is the beginning of a bigger vision.  I have a desire to have a center where my book is lived out.  Eventually, centers in major cities across the USA.  The center will be a place to coach kids, teens and adults on personal development from the inside out.  We will provide mentorship in teaching them how to be leaders and live life with intention and purpose.</p>
<p>I appreciate each and every donation, and because helping people improve their lives is my #1 goal, I've committed gift awards for different contribution levels that are sure to help the many of you who donate.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you!</strong></p>
<p>If you haven't already, please take a moment to watch the video and watch my client's testimony on the next tab.</p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>Adversity and challenge are part of life. They bring a positive and compelling reason to take action. Believe &amp; Be, my life's work in helping others, will become a book. I see it, I feel it, and I know it. I need your help and belief in my project to succeed. I am so excited!</p>
<p>With your support, I will achieve my funding goal of $10,000. With a successful campaign, my book will be completed and ready for publishing by October, 2013. The funds I am raising will go largely to the ghost writers I have hired ie interview me, write, edit, revise and finalize it for publishing. I plan to publish 300 copies, initially.</p>
<p>John Peragine and Heather Hummel , my professional ghost writers, have years of experience in professional writing. Heather's books have appeared in Publishers Weekly, USA Today, and the Washington Post. She's received many writing awards. John has written over a dozen books, has an advanced degree in Natural Health, and written for a number of magazines and newspapers. Together, John and Heather offer me the expertise to get my book written and published. In early June, I traveled form Sacramento to Charlottesville, VA. to meet with John and Heather for 4 days. We are off and running. I've drained my bank account for my initial deposit of $4,000 for their work. I have a publisher ready. The book will be softbound and ebook ready. I plan to publish, initially, 300 copies of my book to honor my awards outlined in this project site. Each copy is approximately, $5. So,$1,500 of my $10,000 will go to awards. The balance of the funds will go to my writing team, John and Heather.</p>
<p>Challenges are good. I've had many in my life as we all do. I will make it happen. However, I know this, I can't spell S CCESS with U. Your kind gift/donation will help make my dream come true. I am so excited.</p>
<p>Thank you! <br/> Tamara <br/> ""T""</p>
<p><strong>My BIO</strong></p>
<p>I believe that in order to lead an intentional successful life it must start with a healthy belief system. Out on the street at ,15, I had to learn how to survive in a world filled with lures and temptations. My belief system, or lack thereof due to family dysfunctions, was challenged on a daily basis. Knowing that this was not the life I desired nor chose, I sought out people with wisdom, faith-based mentorship, and dedicated myself to discovering and building a stronger foundation or belief system. I met people along my journey that allowed me to better understand the power of a worthy and valued belief system. It was with this awareness, I could then begin to truly live, believe and be not held back by a destructive and/or dysfunctional belief system. I took personal responsibility for re-inventing my new, healthy belief system (mine, not others).</p>
<p>I have led a busy life as an entrepreneur, life coach, personal trainer, and struggling single mom, but made a commitment to raising my two daughters, ensuring they had a healthy belief system along with a strong faith-based foundation. I and my daughters wanted to share the work we did with our own belief systems. In 2006, we created “Faith Girls” to teach other young girls how to build a strong, belief system, and to walk confidently in just ""being"". My experiences since age 15, the wonderful people I met along the way, my motherhood, my faith, and my desire to learn more, gave me a knew sense of purpose and passion. I wanted to help other people grow in their own self-esteem, belief system and to help them gain their personal power back. In 2011, as a fitness and life coach, I created Intentional Living (iLiving), then Women of Intention in 2012. And, Women of Worth was born in March, 2013.</p>
<p>Women of Worth or “WOW” will help women discover their true inner strength and beauty by building a stronger, more vibrant belief system. The goal of WOW is to build a life of worth and value, from the inside out.</p>
<p>I need your belief in my passion and conviction to help bring my book, Believe &amp; Be, to life and in the hands of many.</p>
<p> </p>

I appreciate each and every donation, and because helping people improve their lives is my #1 goal, I've committed gift awards for different contribution levels that are sure to help the many of you who donate.
Thank you!

Risks and challenges
Adversity and challenge are part of life. They bring a positive and compelling reason to take action. Believe & Be, my life's work in helping others, will become a book. I see it, I feel it, and I know it. I need your help and belief in my project to succeed. I am so excited!
With your support, I will achieve my funding goal of $10,000. With a successful campaign, my book will be completed and ready for publishing by October, 2013. The funds I am raising will go largely to the ghost writers I have hired ie interview me, write, edit, revise and finalize it for publishing. I plan to publish 300 copies, initially.
John Peragine and Heather Hummel , my professional ghost writers, have years of experience in professional writing. Heather's books have appeared in Publishers Weekly, USA Today, and the Washington Post. She's received many writing awards. John has written over a dozen books, has an advanced degree in Natural Health, and written for a number of magazines and newspapers. Together, John and Heather offer me the expertise to get my book written and published. In early June, I traveled form Sacramento to Charlottesville, VA. to meet with John and Heather for 4 days. We are off and running. I've drained my bank account for my initial deposit of $4,000 for their work. I have a publisher ready. The book will be softbound and ebook ready. I plan to publish, initially, 300 copies of my book to honor my awards outlined in this project site. Each copy is approximately, $5. So,$1,500 of my $10,000 will go to awards. The balance of the funds will go to my writing team, John and Heather.
Challenges are good. I've had many in my life as we all do. I will make it happen. However, I know this, I can't spell S CCESS with U. Your kind gift/donation will help make my dream come true. I am so excited.
Thank you!  Tamara  ""T""
My BIO
I believe that in order to lead an intentional successful life it must start with a healthy belief system. Out on the street at ,15, I had to learn how to survive in a world filled with lures and temptations. My belief system, or lack thereof due to family dysfunctions, was challenged on a daily basis. Knowing that this was not the life I desired nor chose, I sought out people with wisdom, faith-based mentorship, and dedicated myself to discovering and building a stronger foundation or belief system. I met people along my journey that allowed me to better understand the power of a worthy and valued belief system. It was with this awareness, I could then begin to truly live, believe and be not held back by a destructive and/or dysfunctional belief system. I took personal responsibility for re-inventing my new, healthy belief system (mine, not others).
I have led a busy life as an entrepreneur, life coach, personal trainer, and struggling single mom, but made a commitment to raising my two daughters, ensuring they had a healthy belief system along with a strong faith-based foundation. I and my daughters wanted to share the work we did with our own belief systems. In 2006, we created “Faith Girls” to teach other young girls how to build a strong, belief system, and to walk confidently in just ""being"". My experiences since age 15, the wonderful people I met along the way, my motherhood, my faith, and my desire to learn more, gave me a knew sense of purpose and passion. I wanted to help other people grow in their own self-esteem, belief system and to help them gain their personal power back. In 2011, as a fitness and life coach, I created Intentional Living (iLiving), then Women of Intention in 2012. And, Women of Worth was born in March, 2013.
Women of Worth or “WOW” will help women discover their true inner strength and beauty by building a stronger, more vibrant belief system. The goal of WOW is to build a life of worth and value, from the inside out.
I need your belief in my passion and conviction to help bring my book, Believe & Be, to life and in the hands of many.

<p><em>I really am such a fan! Good luck!”</em></p>
<p> —Victoria Smith, sfgirlbybay.com</p>
<p>We launched the online lifestyle magazine <em>Covet Garden</em> with a mission to give you a rare peek into the lives and homes of people with lots of imagination who have decorated their living spaces by themselves.</p>
<p>While people love the online magazine, the most frequent question we hear is, When will you have a print edition?</p>
<p>We want to make that happen.</p>
<p>Our plan is to produce what we are calling <em>Covet Garden Home</em>—a 100+ page half magazine/half book  will explore more about inventive spaces by revisiting your favourite homes from past issues of <em>Covet Garden</em> PLUS featuring brand-new environments, DIY projects and food and drink ideas. Our goal is to deliver printed and bound copies to our readers by Winter 2013.</p>
<p>Why are we asking for help? We haven’t charged anything to bring you <em>Covet Garden</em> magazine online, but a print version means additional production costs such as paper, printing and shipping from the printing press to our offices and then to our readers.</p>
<p>In short, we’d like to raise $18,000 to help cover these necessary expenses. This figure is not the full project cost; we hope to make money (and spread the word about <em>Covet Garden</em>) by selling the print edition in stores and through booksellers as well as online. </p>
<p>Here's where the $18,000 that we’re trying to raise will go:</p>
<p><strong>Creating New Content</strong></p>
<p>We know you love our past features, but we also want to make the print version a new experience. Which is why we want to photograph new spaces, bring you updates on past homeowners and novel DIY projects and food and drink ideas for entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Production</strong></p>
<p>We want to use the best possible paper and technology so that the special print edition of Covet Garden will be a resource you’ll want to keep forever. It’s also important to us to have it printed locally rather than overseas.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for visiting this campaign page.  We really appreciate all the support that we've gotten from you, our amazing readers!</strong></p>
<p>We understand that times are tough, but if you can help spread the word through Facebook or Twitter, we would be eternally grateful. And if you can contribute, please use the IndieGoGo share tools to help pass the news along.</p></div>","Campaign Update #3

<h3>About Me and My Campaign</h3>
<p>        I am 25 years old, going on 26 here soon in March. I graduated from Loveland High School in 2006 and attended college at UC Raymond Walters College and Northern Kentucky University for Liberal and Fine Arts. Anything and everything artistic has always inspired me throughout my entire life and eventually gave me the idea to create this novel, Pink Spades. I combined my interest in Japanese culture, reincarnation, fantasy, the paranormal, the fashion world, and music into one story.</p>
<p>       The purpose of this campaign is to raise money in order to publish my novel with a self-publishing company that I want to partner with. Through self publishing, I can keep all the rights to my work and wont need to put myself through the long and  sometimes gruelling process of searching for an agent and/or publisher to take an interest in my hard work. There is so much I want to accomplish with this novel and it has been my dream to be a published author for a long time.</p>
<p>        Contributors to this project will help me achieve a great deal. Not only will I get this novel published, but I will have more opportunities available to me for advertising this story. I want to create a comic book series for it, have it become a motion picture, a videogame, and I want to compose music for the novel with the songs I have written as well.</p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>         I will need about $1000 dollars to pay out to the publishing company, Author House. In return for your help, I will send out photo copies of, or the  original hand-drawn artwork based on the story. I will also send out copies of sample chapters for your reading pleasure. If I do not meet my goal, I will keep all donations in savings and build on it by my own means. All contributers will be mentioned in the acknowledgments segment of the novel.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>       I believe this novel will have a great impact in the sci-fi/fantasy world. There is a lack of diveristy in my opinion and have always longed for characters that I could actually relate to. My novel is packed with information on Japanese culture and ventures through other cultures around the globe as well. So far, this novel is going to be featured in a local online magazine (The Loveland Magazine)</p>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>      If you cannot contribute to this project financially, you can help spread the word for donations or about the novel in general. I have a facebook group and a page for the novel and plan on putting up a website in the near future. You can also use the indiegogo share tools. I will take any opportunity to build my fan base before the novel is published. Every little bit helps!</p>

</h3><p>
</p><p>Soy
María Pía, escribo desde que me conozco y siempre soñé con el día que
publicaría mi primera novela. Desde chica participé en talleres literarios y
pasaba días, tardes y veranos enteros escribiendo; mis preferidos siempre
fueron los cuentos y novelas infantiles. Participé en cuanto concurso vi y llegué
a tener cuentos cortos publicados. Es realmente maravilloso saber que mis
palabras y mis historias están llegando a niños que se inspiran, crecen y
divierten conmigo. El siguiente paso es publicar una novela; habiendo escrito
varias, supe que “Enigmas en el cerro Pan de Azúcar” era la elegida - siempre
tuvo un lugar especial en mi corazón. Me presenté a editorial tras editorial de
mi pequeño país, Uruguay, pero el mercado infantil juvenil, especialmente para nuevos
autores, es sumamente difícil. Aún las que me dieron buenas críticas, me
cerraron por completo las puertas.  </p>
<p>¡Por
eso me decidí a publicar por mi cuenta! El detalle es que también implica la
distribución y promoción en cuenta propia, llegando a cifras desbordantes y
haciendo el camino muy cuesta arriba. Por eso estoy pidiendo ayuda por este
medio a todos mis amigos y todos los amantes de la lectura (y de promoverla en
las nuevas generaciones), con este primer gran paso: PUBLICAR. </p>

Lo más común es que el autor siempre termine con números en rojo y un stock de libros que le costó mucho publicar pero no puede ubicar. Edición, publicación, distribución y difusión son los pasos generales. Las editoriales que financian un proyecto es común que también se encarguen de la distribución y por eso, si uno está publicando por fuera (como sería este caso), cuesta muchísimo lograr que librerías y otros mercados acepten vender el libro y los esfuerzos sumado a los costos de promoción junto a la difusión también sufren (doblando el presupuesto de solo la publicación). </p><p>En esta etapa, con la campaña aspiro a cubrir los costos de la publicación, para después asumir por cuenta propia el resto de los gastos.

subir a la cima del cerro. Hacía tiempo que querían hacerlo así que esta vez
van, acompañadas de los padres de Emilia y de su hermano Matías. Es en esa
escalada cuando se les cruzan en su camino enigmas del Pan de Azúcar, que paso
a paso irán intentando resolver buscando desentrañar uno de los secretos
mejores guardados del Uruguay y del mundo.</p><i>Lugares</i><p>El Cerro Pan de Azúcar es uno de
los puntos de referencia del balneario de Piriápolis, Uruguay. Uno de los puntos más elevados del país, se distingue por la gran cruz en su cima. Por
<span>un lado es fácil de acceder siguiendo el camino
turista; por otro, sumamente difícil por sus enormes y empinadas rocas. Encierra secretos muy bien guardados que la
historia aún mantiene ocultos.

</span></p><p>Piriápolis
es uno de los balnearios, al menos en mi humilde opinión,
más <span>atractivos de Uruguay. Cerro y playa.
Mística, aventura, cultura, entretenimiento.
Misterio en todos sus rincones. Un lugar con historia impactante desde sus inicios, cuando Francisco <span>Piria, </span>su fundador, vio sus potencialidades. Me inspira
verdadera energía positiva cada vez que
lo visito.</span></p><p><span><span>Uno de los
puntos clave del tour por el lugar es el Castillo </span>de <span>Piria</span>, una edificación maravillosa que sirvió de residencia <span>del fundador </span>durante un corto lapso de tiempo. Se dice que fue
parte de su recorrido en la búsqueda espiritual
extremadamente vinculada a la alquimia, arte y ciencia que se cree que investigó.

<p><b>Help me publish my first novel</b></p>
<p>Help Me Publish My First Novel!</p>
<p>I am María Pía. I write since I can recall, and I dreamed of the day I could publish my first novel. Since I was little I attended literature workshops, and spent afternoons, days, even whole summers writing; I always preferred fairytales and children's novels. I participated on every competition I saw, and had some of my short stories publish. It's really amazing to know that my words and stories are reaching children that get inspired, grow and get joy with my work. The next step is to publish a novel; having some written down, I knew “Enigmas en el cerro Pan de Azúcar” (Enigmas at the Pan de Azucar hill) was the chosen one - It always had a special place in my heart. I went from one publishing house to another, within my small country, Uruguay, but the market directed to children, (especially for new authors) it's really difficult to access. Even those who gave me good critics and opinions of my work, had closed doors for it to be published.</p>
<p>That's why I decided to publish independently! The thing is, it also implies the distribution and advertising on my own, increasing the numbers overboard and making the path uphill. That's why I am asking for help by this campaign to all my friends, and those who love reading (And those who like to promote that love into new generations), with this big step: PUBLISH. </p>
<p>Please, help me publish my first children's novel: “Enigmas en el cerro Pan de Azúcar”!!!</p>
<p><b>How are the funds going to be used?</b><br/></p>
<p>Publishing a book means a lot of costs have to be covered. The common scenario is the author getting his/her budget into red numbers, and a huge stock of books he/she spent a lot into printing but cannot allocate on his/her own. Editing, publishing, distribution, and advertising are the general steps. The publishing houses that fund a project, commonly take care of distributing it, and because of that, if you are publishing on your own (as is, in this case) it cost a lot of effort to get bookshops and other sale places into accepting to offer your book; the efforts to distribute, and the costs of advertising suffer greatly of because of this (doubling the publishing budget).</p>
<p>At this phase, with the campaign, I aspire to cover the publishing costs, to then cover on my own the other expenses. In other words, the funds collected with your help will be used into the editing and printing of the book ""Enigmas en el cerro Pan de Azúcar"".</p>
<p><b>What are the perks for contributing?</b></p>
<p>Besides the satisfaction of being part on a publishing project, promoting interest in literature (new literature), and bring aid to children's literature, you would get some interesting rewards for your contribution. </p>
<p>Here goes the list of pretty stuff you would received for contributing - not to mention my Greatest Gratitude!! Everything and anything helps!!.</p>

<p><b>A little bit about the book…</b></p>
<p><i>Review</i></p>
<p>During this vacations to Piriápolis, Tamara and Emilia won't let the opportunity to climb to the top of the hill. It's been time since they wanted to do it, so this time they will, accompanied by Emilia's parents and brother Matías. It's at that climbing that they come across their path, the Enigmas of the Pan de Azúcar Hill, that step by step they will be trying to solve, looking to unveil one of the better guarded secrets of Uruguay and the world.</p>
<p><i>Places</i></p>
<p>The Pan de Azúcar hill it's a landmark of the Piriápolis resort, Uruguay. One of the highest places in the country, distinguished by the great Cross at it's top. From one side the tourist's path it's easy to access, and to walk, from the other it's a completely different story, it's huge builders and sharp edged rocks makes it too tough. It keeps secrets, that the story has yet to uncover, very well. </p>
<p>Piriápolis it's a resort, at least on my humble opinion, the more attractive of Uruguay. with it's hill and beach (Mystery, adventure, culture, entertainment). Mystery in all it's corners. A place with an astonishing history since it's beginnings, when Francisco Piria, it's founder, saw it's potentials. It inspires me a truly positive energy whenever I visit it.</p>
<p>One of the key elements of the tour at the place is the Piria's castle, a marvelous building that serve as residence to its founder for a short amount of time. It is said that it was a part of his spiritual journey strongly linked to art, alchemy and science, which he was believed to had been researching. Nowadays it's a museum.</p>

fueron los cuentos y novelas infantiles. Participé en cuanto concurso vi y llegué
a tener cuentos cortos publicados. Es realmente maravilloso saber que mis
palabras y mis historias están llegando a niños que se inspiran, crecen y
divierten conmigo. El siguiente paso es publicar una novela; habiendo escrito
varias, supe que “Enigmas en el cerro Pan de Azúcar” era la elegida - siempre
tuvo un lugar especial en mi corazón. Me presenté a editorial tras editorial de
mi pequeño país, Uruguay, pero el mercado infantil juvenil, especialmente para nuevos
autores, es sumamente difícil. Aún las que me dieron buenas críticas, me
cerraron por completo las puertas.  
¡Por
eso me decidí a publicar por mi cuenta! El detalle es que también implica la
distribución y promoción en cuenta propia, llegando a cifras desbordantes y
haciendo el camino muy cuesta arriba. Por eso estoy pidiendo ayuda por este
medio a todos mis amigos y todos los amantes de la lectura (y de promoverla en
las nuevas generaciones), con este primer gran paso: PUBLICAR. 
¡¡¡Por favor ayudame a publicar mi primera novela infantil-juvenil: “Enigmas en
el cerro Pan de Azúcar”!!!¿En qué se van a usar los fondos recaudados?Publicar un libro tiene muchísimos costos. Lo más común es que el autor siempre termine con números en rojo y un stock de libros que le costó mucho publicar pero no puede ubicar. Edición, publicación, distribución y difusión son los pasos generales. Las editoriales que financian un proyecto es común que también se encarguen de la distribución y por eso, si uno está publicando por fuera (como sería este caso), cuesta muchísimo lograr que librerías y otros mercados acepten vender el libro y los esfuerzos sumado a los costos de promoción junto a la difusión también sufren (doblando el presupuesto de solo la publicación). En esta etapa, con la campaña aspiro a cubrir los costos de la publicación, para después asumir por cuenta propia el resto de los gastos. Los fondos que recaude la campaña serán destinados a la edición e imprenta del libro ""Enigmas en el cerro Pan de Azúcar"".¿Cuáles son tus recompensas por colaborar?Además de la satisfacción por formar parte de un proyecto editorial, de fomentar el interés por la lectura y de brindar apoyo a la literatura infantil juvenil podés obtener divertidas recompensas con tu colaboración.Aquí va la lista de cosas lindas que recibes
por colaborar – además de mi ¡¡más graaaande agradecimiento!! ¡¡Todo y cualquier
cosa ayuda!!1) Libro en PDF + dedicatoria por e-mail2) Libro copia real + dedicatoria 3) Libro copia real + dedicatoria + remera4) Libro copia real x2 para regalar + dedicatorias5) Libro copia real + dedicatoria  +  invitación al brindis6) Libro copia real + dedicatoria + remera + invitación al brindisSi

Durante estas
vacaciones a Piriápolis Tamara y Emilia no dejarán pasar la oportunidad de
subir a la cima del cerro. Hacía tiempo que querían hacerlo así que esta vez
van, acompañadas de los padres de Emilia y de su hermano Matías. Es en esa
escalada cuando se les cruzan en su camino enigmas del Pan de Azúcar, que paso
a paso irán intentando resolver buscando desentrañar uno de los secretos
mejores guardados del Uruguay y del mundo.LugaresEl Cerro Pan de Azúcar es uno de
los puntos de referencia del balneario de Piriápolis, Uruguay. Uno de los puntos más elevados del país, se distingue por la gran cruz en su cima. Por
un lado es fácil de acceder siguiendo el camino
turista; por otro, sumamente difícil por sus enormes y empinadas rocas. Encierra secretos muy bien guardados que la
historia aún mantiene ocultos.

Piriápolis
es uno de los balnearios, al menos en mi humilde opinión,
más atractivos de Uruguay. Cerro y playa.
Mística, aventura, cultura, entretenimiento.
Misterio en todos sus rincones. Un lugar con historia impactante desde sus inicios, cuando Francisco Piria, su fundador, vio sus potencialidades. Me inspira
verdadera energía positiva cada vez que
lo visito.Uno de los
puntos clave del tour por el lugar es el Castillo de Piria, una edificación maravillosa que sirvió de residencia del fundador durante un corto lapso de tiempo. Se dice que fue
parte de su recorrido en la búsqueda espiritual
extremadamente vinculada a la alquimia, arte y ciencia que se cree que investigó. Actualmente es un museo.Un poco sobre mí...Mi nombre: María Pía CaputoMi edad: 25 años (al menos hasta el 3 de noviembre)Mi país: UruguayMi profesión: MaestraMi pasión: escribir (y enseñar, escribiendo también).............................................................................................
Help me publish my first novel
Help Me Publish My First Novel!
I am María Pía. I write since I can recall, and I dreamed of the day I could publish my first novel. Since I was little I attended literature workshops, and spent afternoons, days, even whole summers writing; I always preferred fairytales and children's novels. I participated on every competition I saw, and had some of my short stories publish. It's really amazing to know that my words and stories are reaching children that get inspired, grow and get joy with my work. The next step is to publish a novel; having some written down, I knew “Enigmas en el cerro Pan de Azúcar” (Enigmas at the Pan de Azucar hill) was the chosen one - It always had a special place in my heart. I went from one publishing house to another, within my small country, Uruguay, but the market directed to children, (especially for new authors) it's really difficult to access. Even those who gave me good critics and opinions of my work, had closed doors for it to be published.
That's why I decided to publish independently! The thing is, it also implies the distribution and advertising on my own, increasing the numbers overboard and making the path uphill. That's why I am asking for help by this campaign to all my friends, and those who love reading (And those who like to promote that love into new generations), with this big step: PUBLISH. 
Please, help me publish my first children's novel: “Enigmas en el cerro Pan de Azúcar”!!!
How are the funds going to be used?
Publishing a book means a lot of costs have to be covered. The common scenario is the author getting his/her budget into red numbers, and a huge stock of books he/she spent a lot into printing but cannot allocate on his/her own. Editing, publishing, distribution, and advertising are the general steps. The publishing houses that fund a project, commonly take care of distributing it, and because of that, if you are publishing on your own (as is, in this case) it cost a lot of effort to get bookshops and other sale places into accepting to offer your book; the efforts to distribute, and the costs of advertising suffer greatly of because of this (doubling the publishing budget).
At this phase, with the campaign, I aspire to cover the publishing costs, to then cover on my own the other expenses. In other words, the funds collected with your help will be used into the editing and printing of the book ""Enigmas en el cerro Pan de Azúcar"".
What are the perks for contributing?
Besides the satisfaction of being part on a publishing project, promoting interest in literature (new literature), and bring aid to children's literature, you would get some interesting rewards for your contribution. 
Here goes the list of pretty stuff you would received for contributing - not to mention my Greatest Gratitude!! Everything and anything helps!!.
1) PDF E-book + Personal message by E-mail.
2) Printed copy + Handwritten dedication and signature.
3) Printed copy + Handwritten dedication and signature + T-shirt.
4) Printed copy x 2 (to give as a gift) + Handwritten dedication and signature.
5) Printed copy + Handwritten dedication and signature (During the toast) +  Toast invitation.
6) Printed copy + Handwritten dedication and signature (During the toast) + T-shirt + Toast Invitation.
If you live aboard (outside Uruguay), please donate $25 USD extra to cover shipping costs.
If you can't contribute directly, please help me out by letting your friends and acquaintances who might be interested, know about this campaign.  :)

A little bit about the book…
Review
During this vacations to Piriápolis, Tamara and Emilia won't let the opportunity to climb to the top of the hill. It's been time since they wanted to do it, so this time they will, accompanied by Emilia's parents and brother Matías. It's at that climbing that they come across their path, the Enigmas of the Pan de Azúcar Hill, that step by step they will be trying to solve, looking to unveil one of the better guarded secrets of Uruguay and the world.
Places
The Pan de Azúcar hill it's a landmark of the Piriápolis resort, Uruguay. One of the highest places in the country, distinguished by the great Cross at it's top. From one side the tourist's path it's easy to access, and to walk, from the other it's a completely different story, it's huge builders and sharp edged rocks makes it too tough. It keeps secrets, that the story has yet to uncover, very well. 
Piriápolis it's a resort, at least on my humble opinion, the more attractive of Uruguay. with it's hill and beach (Mystery, adventure, culture, entertainment). Mystery in all it's corners. A place with an astonishing history since it's beginnings, when Francisco Piria, it's founder, saw it's potentials. It inspires me a truly positive energy whenever I visit it.
One of the key elements of the tour at the place is the Piria's castle, a marvelous building that serve as residence to its founder for a short amount of time. It is said that it was a part of his spiritual journey strongly linked to art, alchemy and science, which he was believed to had been researching. Nowadays it's a museum.

<h3><b>We are a ramshackle group of poets, bound for the national college poetry slam.</b></h3>
<p>This year's Grand Slam at Columbia University appeared out of nowhere, thanks to its revival by a few Columbia students, who somehow managed to cobble together a slam. Between the time the slam was announced in January and the night before the slam, <b>nineteen poets had signed up</b>, and <b>fourteen competitors slammed. </b>Every poet showed unforseen talent, bringing poetry that was inquisitive, sincere and emotionally demanding, and <b>an audience of over two hundred</b> proved how badly Columbia wants more of it!</p>
<p>Now, <b>the top five poets</b> from the slam have formed a team, and are headed to Virginia Commonwealth University for the 2015 National College Poetry Slam, CUPSI! Hailing from all across the country and all different writing backgrounds, these five poets managed to convince the judges that their poetry was worthy to go national. They are no joke:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Alyssa Paul </b><br/>A sophomore at Columbia University, Alyssa is a film studies major and aspiring actress. Growing up in Los Angeles, she began doing spoken word poetry in high school and can't wait to start up again in college. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Chloé ""Kidd"" Matthews</b><br/>A native of Clinton, LA, Chloe is a student at Columbia studying English and African American Studies. She began writing in middle school and co-founded her high school's slam team in tenth grade. The following year she attended Brave New Voices as a member of Team Baton Rouge. She likes short walks in grain pastures and rugby balls. </li>
<li>
<b>Ficara McDoom</b><br/>Ficara is from Connecticut and is a student at Barnard College. She intends to double major in English and Film Studies. She writes to be understood and to understand herself. The most telling and only relevant things to note are that she likes old things and the smell of wood. Nothing further. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Gabrielle Smith</b><br/>Writing slam poetry has shown Gabrielle Smith—a product, of the Philly Youth Poetry Movement—that the world is filled with challenges that demand attention. During her writing process, she confronts multiple perspectives on womanhood, love, and God. “When I first started, it seemed very simple; you just put your emotions on the page,” she says. “But the art of performance poetry is so intricate and intertwined. I love how hard it is to make a picture on the stage and on the page. I love how hard it is to do a beautiful job.”<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Max Binder</b><br/>Raised in Providence, Rhode Island, Max got into spoken word his junior year of high school and<i> also</i> went to Brave New Voices in 2013 (and never ran into Kidd!) After a year of staffing at Providence Poetry Slam, Max is a first year at Columbia College helping to organize the start-up Barnumbia Slam!</li>

<h3>We've got poems. You've got Money. Let's make a deal.</h3>
<p>We'll break this down rules-of-poetry-slam style.</p>
<p><b>Rule #1: Slams cost money.</b></p>
<p>National poetry events are an amazing experience: they're like an athletic conference for poets. They bring out teams from all across the country for a few nights, and usually have special events, super-famous featured poets hanging around, and require a whole lot of organization and event space. CUPSI is no exception; between March 25th and 28th, some sixty teams/three hundred-odd poets will be going at it for the glory. As a result, slams like CUPSI cost a lot to attend, and we're sending five poets and two coaches. <b>The team will have to pay:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">$800 for registration</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">$800 for transporting 7 member between Virginia and New York</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">$1,700 for four days food and lodging</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">$200 Misc expenses (because things go wrong when people travel)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>For a grand total of <b>$3,500! </b>We know that's no small sum, and we can't pay it by ourselves because:</p>
<p><b>Rule #2: (Student) Poets are broke.</b></p>
<p>These poets are paying for school, books, and living expenses, while making next to no money. And right now, <b>getting money from Columbia is difficult.</b> The Barnard Writers Collective (host group of the CU CUPSI Team) doesn't have a budget! We're doing what we can to collect donations at slams, but <b>to get most of the money, </b><i><b>we need you!</b></i></p>
<p><b>Rule #3: People love poetry!</b></p>
<p>Nuts to ""a dying art form,"" we're cultivating a community of writers that thrives on free speech! Where poets put their stories forward in ways that enlighten all of our lives! Where free expression is transformed into freedom from oppression! Where hard truths are spoken loudly for the world to hear!! The world needs more poetry, and this cannot happen without you!!!</p>
<p>But if that's not enough incentive, we have some <b>fantastic rewards</b> for your donations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Team chapbook!</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Once CUPSI is through, the best work from the team's poems (!!including group pieces!!) will be anthologized in a limited edition chapbook, one of the owners of which will be you!</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Poem postcards!</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Get a gorgeous postcard featuring some of the work the team produces on the road to CUPSI; some poignant lines to make your heart swell or break that you can keep on your refrigerator forever!</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Custom gifts from the team! </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">On top of a chapbook and postcard, five especially generous donors will receive a special gift, hand-picked/crafted by the team when all the poetry is done!</span>
</li>

<b>Building these poets.</b> Being on a poetry slam team is a chance for a few lucky poets to hone their skills and to grow and develop as writers. It's a chance for them to be challenged to experiment with new language and to learn to say things no one has ever said before! We want to invest in sending this amazing work, but also:</li>
<li>
<b>Bringing the poetry back home. </b>Once these poets have had a chance to develop their work, they can come home and put their energy and their fire back into the community, and inspire the next wave of writers through writing together and sharing their skills!</li>
<li>
<b>Starting strong and aiming high. </b>This team is going to be the first of what we hope will be many generations of Columbia slam teams that aim to show the world the creativity and insight that being a student at Columbia University truly means.

<b>Graphic design for us? </b>We're actually looking for someone to help us make amazing logos for things like: this indiegogo page! The Columbia Poetry Slam! The Writing Collective!

(I'm a bunch of other adjectives and nouns: fat, queer, communist, activist, teacher, feminist, grandmother. But writers get wordy. I have to narrow it down and get to the point.) I've been publishing 30 years in anthologies (Ghost Town Poetry) and magazines (Sinister Wisdom, The Advocate) and a staggering number of zines, newsletters, newspapers and blogs. I've been delighted to be involved in so many indie projects, reading series, small presses and writing conferences. Sadly the reality is that many of them cannot afford to pay writers or presenters or staff. Such is the case of NW Poets Concord --a wonderful small annual poetry conference in Newport, Oregon-- where I will be presenting a workshop entitled ""Dissecting the Sacred: making new poems from old"". I'll also be part of their New Books reading series and reading from mine: ""Chiaroscuro Kisses"" (Headmistress Press).</p><p>I'm going to tell you two things you already knew: </p><ul>
<li>Being poor is costly.</li>
<li>Being disabled complicates everything.</li>
</ul><p>Gone for me are the days of hitchhiking and sofa surfing. Traveling (with a power wheelchair and a PCA) is exhausting, expensive and requires extensive planning. </p><p>Here's how you can help.  Donate if you can.

<li>If we do not raise enough to rent a van (or a car/SUV that can accommodate the wheelchair) and we have to take the Amtrak or Greyhound bus (tickets for self and attendant $130-$180) it will be necessary to stay an additional day in the hotel because the bus only leaves Newport at 5 am.</li>

</ul><p></p><p>It takes a village... thanks for being a part of mine!</p></div>","Short SummaryHi! I'm G.L. Morrison. I'm a disabled poet. (I'm a bunch of other adjectives and nouns: fat, queer, communist, activist, teacher, feminist, grandmother. But writers get wordy. I have to narrow it down and get to the point.) I've been publishing 30 years in anthologies (Ghost Town Poetry) and magazines (Sinister Wisdom, The Advocate) and a staggering number of zines, newsletters, newspapers and blogs. I've been delighted to be involved in so many indie projects, reading series, small presses and writing conferences. Sadly the reality is that many of them cannot afford to pay writers or presenters or staff. Such is the case of NW Poets Concord --a wonderful small annual poetry conference in Newport, Oregon-- where I will be presenting a workshop entitled ""Dissecting the Sacred: making new poems from old"". I'll also be part of their New Books reading series and reading from mine: ""Chiaroscuro Kisses"" (Headmistress Press).I'm going to tell you two things you already knew: 
Being poor is costly.
Being disabled complicates everything.
Gone for me are the days of hitchhiking and sofa surfing. Traveling (with a power wheelchair and a PCA) is exhausting, expensive and requires extensive planning. Here's how you can help.  Donate if you can. Pass this on (sensibly please -no crazy spamming) to friends or groups you belong to.What We Need 
conference registration $75 (a delightful bargain)
workshop materials $20
$350-450 Food/Lodging at the Hallmark Inn
rental of wheelchair van is $110/day 
If we do not raise enough to rent a van (or a car/SUV that can accommodate the wheelchair) and we have to take the Amtrak or Greyhound bus (tickets for self and attendant $130-$180) it will be necessary to stay an additional day in the hotel because the bus only leaves Newport at 5 am.
& What You Get (The Perks)
I want to thank Judith Witherow for donating her book ""Strong Enough to Bend"" to give contributors. I'm including my own ""Chiaroscuro Kisses"" as well. I've also asked a number of amazing writers to donate books and autographed broadsides (poem-posters). I'm offering a manuscript critique and an online version of the workshop. Heartfelt gratitude goes out to anyone who contributes (and I'll put that in writing with a e-card from the conference thanking you for making it possible). Also a custom poem written on a theme of your choice --a terrific gift or to commemorate an important event! Watch this space. I'll update as more perks become available.Other Ways You Can Help

Taylor believed his employees needed an ""ethical yardstick"" by which to do business. The four questions he penned became the Rotary Four-Way Test--the pledge that echoes thousands of times each week across the globe in hundreds of languages. </p><p>The 24 words of the pledge might seem small, but they are significant.  They encapsulate powerful guidelines for how to treat everyone with respect. As our Rotarian population ages, we need to promote the Four-Way Test to a new and younger generation, many of whom already have too little experience with positive character models.

The four questions he penned became the Rotary Four-Way Test--the pledge that echoes thousands of times each week across the globe in hundreds of languages. The 24 words of the pledge might seem small, but they are significant.  They encapsulate powerful guidelines for how to treat everyone with respect. As our Rotarian population ages, we need to promote the Four-Way Test to a new and younger generation, many of whom already have too little experience with positive character models. This book shows inspirational examples of how the Test works in action, and it is designed to serve as a useful tool in education and outreach for years to come.About Me

A <a href=""http://www.votetogether.ca/riding/35014/brucegreyowen-sound/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">recent poll</a> suggests that it is within the realm of the possible to defeat our Conservative candidate locally and give Harper one less seat federally.

<h3><b>WHO IS GARY V. LETT?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hello, I am Gary V. Lett. I am currently a working ceramic artist and sculpture. I teach at the American Museum of Ceramic Art (AMOCA) located in Pomona, and at Foothill Country Day School in Claremont, California.  I reside in Pomona with Lisha, my wife of 36 years. We have two adult sons and six grandchildren. I spent over 25 years working in the graphic art field and as the principal of <i>Lett’s Do Art, </i>a graphic art firm<i>;</i> directed and taught art for various children art programs in San Antonio, Texas, and I am a licensed minister. And now I am embarking on my very first published children’s book.</p>
<p><b>THE CAMPAIGN</b>: It has taken me decades to get where I am today with this project, writing and illustrating a little here and there. This book promotes compassion, healthy eating, exercise, family, and community. The publishing of this book is a grand milestone for my family and me! Over the course of my wonderful marriage, career, and other endeavors, this one experience, in comparison, pales many of the others. For me to finally hold and smell a freshly printed copy of <i>Gary &amp; a Box of Salt </i>will be like holding my first-born all over again.</p>
<p><b>YOUR GIVING KEEPS ON GIVING</b>: Charity starts at home. Lisha and I have cared and extend ourselves to others even in our youth, and we probably will always continue to do so on into our golden age! Therefore, in traditional form, we want to help others as we help ourselves. Here are two wonderful charities that will benefit from the sale of this book:Justin Carr Wants World Peace Memorial Fund &amp;The Friends of Pomona Public Library.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The book is ready to go to the printer; all we need are your funds to make that happen. I can send the order right after being funded. Production of the book will take 4-8 weeks but as with any publishing project there can be unforeseen delays or setbacks. We will work our hardest to get this book and perks into your hands on time and keep everyone updated if there are any setbacks to our estimated schedule. </p>
<h3>What else can you do to help?</h3>
<p>The best thing you can do to help us out is to share our campaign! Tell your friends and neighbors and share the campaign through your social media platforms. We appreciate every single share and tweet from the top to the bottom of our hearts! </p>
<p><b>My dream for this project may have been deferred, but it has never dried up!</b></p>
<p>When I was in the sixth grade I won a writing contest. If that win was just based on my illustrations alone, my accomplishment would not have been a big deal. But it truly was! That win came from a kid whose English skills were in the lowest percentile of his sixth-grade class. Creativity has never been an issue for me. But I thank God for a good teacher who used her personal treasure of time and worked with me long hours after school until my sentence structure matched my illustration ability, and it paid off!</p>
<p>Lisha’s and my dream of seeing this book materialize have been ours for years, decades even! I know that deep down inside, ever since that food give-away—the main plot of the book, I’ve wanted to share this story, but because of the lack of finance along with publishers not wanting to pay for 34 color illustrations, those things have kept this book from happening until now! As reality unfolds, and more often than not, achieving success requires the following: great leaps of faith, initiative exercised, and tenacity. These coupled with the right opportunity leads to destiny realized, but let me not leave out the power and benefit of prayer!</p>
<p>The establishing of this printing campaign simulates the scenario of my six-grade book contest and smacks me right back to it. The writing, editing, and illustrations for this book ‒I have done‒ but what I lack right now is money! Today, you sit where that beloved teacher once sat: in the seat of power and where you, too, can make a difference in my life; that of a 59-year-old man whose dream has been deferred, but not dried up! With your dollars, I am closer to living out that dream of seeing <i>Gary &amp; a Box of Salt  </i>in print form and in stores within a matter of months<i>.</i>
</p>
<p>The printing of this book will be a great accomplishment for us all. Won’t you please help by sending in your money today? Thank you! If you like my story and would help but are lacking in finance, rest assured, you can still help and be on our team! Just use your influence with your social media network partners and let people know about my Indiegogo page and ask them to support for my campaign. Remember, no gift is too small; every dollar given gets us closer to our maximum goal, and together, we can do this!</p>

All funds raised will go toward printing cost, shipping, and Indiegogo fees associated with this campaign, along with the costs of your perks. The majority of the funding will go directly to producing a high-quality book and the remainder used for perks, marketing, and promotion.
Risks & Challenges
The book is ready to go to the printer; all we need are your funds to make that happen. I can send the order right after being funded. Production of the book will take 4-8 weeks but as with any publishing project there can be unforeseen delays or setbacks. We will work our hardest to get this book and perks into your hands on time and keep everyone updated if there are any setbacks to our estimated schedule. 
What else can you do to help?
The best thing you can do to help us out is to share our campaign! Tell your friends and neighbors and share the campaign through your social media platforms. We appreciate every single share and tweet from the top to the bottom of our hearts! 
My dream for this project may have been deferred, but it has never dried up!
When I was in the sixth grade I won a writing contest. If that win was just based on my illustrations alone, my accomplishment would not have been a big deal. But it truly was! That win came from a kid whose English skills were in the lowest percentile of his sixth-grade class. Creativity has never been an issue for me. But I thank God for a good teacher who used her personal treasure of time and worked with me long hours after school until my sentence structure matched my illustration ability, and it paid off!
Lisha’s and my dream of seeing this book materialize have been ours for years, decades even! I know that deep down inside, ever since that food give-away—the main plot of the book, I’ve wanted to share this story, but because of the lack of finance along with publishers not wanting to pay for 34 color illustrations, those things have kept this book from happening until now! As reality unfolds, and more often than not, achieving success requires the following: great leaps of faith, initiative exercised, and tenacity. These coupled with the right opportunity leads to destiny realized, but let me not leave out the power and benefit of prayer!
The establishing of this printing campaign simulates the scenario of my six-grade book contest and smacks me right back to it. The writing, editing, and illustrations for this book ‒I have done‒ but what I lack right now is money! Today, you sit where that beloved teacher once sat: in the seat of power and where you, too, can make a difference in my life; that of a 59-year-old man whose dream has been deferred, but not dried up! With your dollars, I am closer to living out that dream of seeing Gary & a Box of Salt  in print form and in stores within a matter of months.

The printing of this book will be a great accomplishment for us all. Won’t you please help by sending in your money today? Thank you! If you like my story and would help but are lacking in finance, rest assured, you can still help and be on our team! Just use your influence with your social media network partners and let people know about my Indiegogo page and ask them to support for my campaign. Remember, no gift is too small; every dollar given gets us closer to our maximum goal, and together, we can do this!",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h2 align=""LEFT""><span style=""font-family: 'American Typewriter', monospace;"">Ich bin nicht krank, ich kann mich nur nicht bewegen!</span></h2>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""font-family: 'American Typewriter', monospace;""> Seit 1994 lebe ich mit der Diagnose ALS – Amyotrophe Lateralsklerose. ALS ist eine Erkrankung des Motorischen Nervensystems, die innerhalb weniger Jahre zu einer fortschreitenden Lähmung der Extremitäten sowie einer Störung bis hin zur Lähmung des Sprechens, Schluckens und der Atmung führt. Erste Symptome der Krankheit zeigten sich 1994 – da war ich 39 Jahre alt, allein erziehende Mutter von zwei Kindern und wollte gerade in eine neue Berufskarriere durchstarten, als unerklärliche Lähmungserscheinungen mich aus meinem bisherigen Leben herauskatapultieren. Es begann eine Odyssee zu den verschiedensten Ärzten – am Ende stand die Diagnose ALS. Seit 1998 bin ich fast vollständig gelähmt und werde über eine Magensonde natürlich ernährt und künstlich beatmet. </span></p>
<p align=""LEFT""> <span style=""font-family: 'American Typewriter', monospace;"">Sechs Jahre lang war ich im dritten Stock meiner Berliner Altbauwohnung ans Bett gefesselt. Lange Zeit auch ohne das Kommunikationshilfsmittel „EyeGaze“, ein Sprachcomputer, der es mir ermöglicht, meine Gedanken und Gefühle mitzuteilen: Ich bediene quasi mit meinen Augen eine Tastatur, eine Laserkamera zeichnet meine Augenbewegungen auf und auf einem Bildschirm erscheinen Worte und Sätze, die auch über einen Lautsprecher hörbar gemacht werden können.</span></p>
<p align=""LEFT""> <span style=""font-family: 'American Typewriter', monospace;"">Davor musste ich mich nur mit einer Buchstabentafel verständigen, wo ich einzelne Buchstaben oder Silben nach deren Häufigkeit so zusammen gestellt hatte, dass eine helfende Person, diese antippen und ich mit einem zustimmenden Augenblinzeln bestätigen konnte, dass ich diesen Buchstaben meinte.</span></p>
<h3 align=""LEFT"">Premiere im Theater</h3>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""font-family: 'American Typewriter', monospace;"">Am 17. November 2004 wurde in der Volksbühne am Rosa Luxemburg Platz in Berlin die Premiere von Christoph Schlingensiefs Stück „A. Hipler, Kunst &amp; Gemüse“ gefeiert. Als Mitautorin des Theaterstückes lenkte und kommentierte ich die Ereignisse auf der Bühne mit Hilfe einer Laserkamera, die einen Computer animierte. Kein Außenstehender hätte es mir zugetraut mit ALS im finalen Stadium, sabbernd, unfähig Arme, Beine oder den Kopf zu bewegen, mit PEG (Magensonde) und beatmet, ich würde an Christophs Schlingensiefs Seite Theater spielen. Niemand hat es geglaubt, dass ich auch noch alles daran setzen würde, zusammen mit der Volksbühnen Crew 'unser Stück' in Paris aufzuführen. Und nachdem mein Flug dorthin der deutschen Bürokratie zum Opfer fiel, nahm ich halt den Nachtzug. Auf dieser Reise wurden wir von einem Kamerateam begleitet und Björn Thönicke hat aus dem Material einen Film geschnitten, der mit dem Titel „Mit den Augen tanzen“ erstmals 2006 einem breiten Fernsehpublikum vorgestellt wurde.</span></p>
<p align=""LEFT""> <span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'American Typewriter', monospace;"">Ich möchte Menschen begreiflich machen, dass ein Leben mit ALS möglich ist. </span></span><span style=""font-family: 'American Typewriter', monospace;"">Ein Leben – nicht nur ein Überleben - ist möglich, wenn eine 24 Stundenpflege im eigenen Zuhause garantiert werden kann und sich die Gesellschaft für den Gedanken öffnet, dass auch schwer behinderte Menschen ihr Leben selbst gestalten wollen und können.</span></p>
<p align=""LEFT""> <span style=""font-family: 'American Typewriter', monospace;"">Die fortgeschrittene Technik in der Medizin erlaubt es heutzutage auch Menschen, deren physische Körper fast vollständig gelähmt sind, ein selbstbestimmtes Leben zu führen. Denn ihr Gehirn und ihr Geist sind völlig funktionsfähig und die ausgereifte medizinische Technik ermöglicht ihnen das auch zu kommunizieren. Ein Beispiel dafür ist der weltbekannte Physiker Steven Hawking, der seit seiner Studienzeit an der progressiv fortschreitenden Krankheit ALS leidet und bis heute an Universitäten lehrt und viel beachtete Fachbücher über die Funktionsweise des Universums geschrieben hat. Forschungen haben auch gezeigt, dass Patienten, die an ALS oder einem Locked-In-Syndrom leiden, durchaus ein positives Lebensgefühl haben, das oft sogar größer ist als das von gesunden Menschen.</span></p>
<p align=""LEFT""> <span style=""font-family: 'American Typewriter', monospace;"">Das große Problem ist aber, dass unsere Gesellschaft, deren Pflegeeinrichtungen und damit auch das Pflegepersonal auf Menschen, die ihr Leben trotz vollständiger Lähmung und künstlicher Beatmung selbst bestimmen wollen, nicht eingestellt sind. Die bisherige Erfahrung war eben, dass Patienten in diesem Zustand nicht kommunizieren und folglich auch nicht an einem „normalen“ Leben teilnehmen könnten. Auch wenn einige von ihnen, nicht stationär untergebracht sind, sondern wie ich mit einer 24 Stunden Pflege in ihrem häuslichen Umfeld betreut werden, ist die vorherrschende Einstellung doch, dass ein solches Leben nicht lebenswert sei, eine Zumutung für die betroffene Person und eine Belastung für ihre Familie.</span></p>
<p align=""LEFT""><span style=""font-family: 'American Typewriter', monospace;""> Niemand ist darauf eingestellt, am wenigsten das betreuende Personal, dass schwer behinderte Personen das Haus verlassen, Ausflüge machen oder sogar an einen exotischen Ort verreisen wollen. </span><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: 'American Typewriter', monospace;"">Ich will Menschen durch mein Beispiel ermutigen und zeigen, was alles möglich ist, wenn man wirklich will und von der Gesellschaft die Unterstützung erhält, die dafür notwendig ist.</span></span></p>

Reisen ist schwierig, aber möglich, wie ich mit meiner Reise im Nachtzug nach Paris gezeigt habe. Ich fahre auch in öffentlichen Bussen zur langen Nacht der Wissenschaften in Berlin, wo ich regelmäßig Vorträge halte und fuhr im überfüllten ICE nach Bonn zu Theaterproben der von Christoph Schlingensief inszenierten Oper „Freax“. Ich stand auch schon mit meinem Rolli neben den Fahrrädern im Regionalexpress nach Rostock, wo ich dieses Jahr mehrere Wochen in einem Wohncontainer vor der Kunsthalle Rostock mein Domizil aufgeschlagen hatte. Dort zeigte ich, dass es sogar möglich ist, „mit Gedanken“ Bilder zu malen.

Our Story
Hello & Thank you for taking the time to visit this campaign! I know your time is precious so I promise that this will be valuable time spent.  My name is Tanika Jones & I have been called to Equip God's people for Victory through the development of an online Christian Magazine - Armed Magazine. Writing has always been my passion and now I am creating an avenue that will allow others to share their ministry of writing with the world!  

Armed Magazine is a multi-ethnic Online Christian Magazine created to promote spiritual growth for Christians who are committed in their walk with Christ and have a strong desire to go deeper in their faith.  Armed is also created to win lost souls for Christ!  

Our editorial mission is to create a community that provides inspiration, motivation, support and knowledge that will equip our readers to be victorious in every area of Christian living.  Armed Magazine will be a destination for our readers to gain spiritual knowledge and encouragement, interact with other Christians, uplift one another, obtain Godly wisdom that will help them to reach victory and develop strategies for applying The Word of God to every area of life. We want our readers to be Spiritually Armed for Battle! 
Here is what Tanika says about the creation of Armed Magazine:""This Magazine was a vision that God placed in my heart a few years ago.  I procrastinated answering the call but it always tugged at my heart.  As I have grown spiritually, I had no other choice but to obey God.  A hope or dream with no action will always remain just a hope or dream.  My prayer is that Armed Magazine will inspire and equip Christians to effectively live a Christ-Centered life.  I've asked God to send His chosen people to this chosen place at His chosen time to build the dream that He has placed in my heart - Armed Magazine.""
 


The Impact
Armed Magazine is scheduled to launch June 2012 & we need your help!! The creation for this magazine developed from a true lacking in the online and digital magazine space for a Christian based publication that is not afraid to tackle the difficult conversations related to Christian living. We have a committed team of 20+ anointed writers and editors that are passionate about using their gifts to build God's Kingdom and to help others grow in their spiritual lives.  

We are asking for your support through financial funding and prayer.  Your donations will help us to build an interactive website for our readers.  The website will feature Biblical & Inspirational content, main features from powerful leaders in the Christian community, a bookstore, discussion forums and more!

I represent a group of authors who have
lost a great deal of money pursuing long held dreams of sharing stories that we
feel will benefit others. We come from all walks of life and live in various states throughout the United
States. We came together when the publishing company, 2 Moon Press, folded on
us leaving each of us without books that had been paid for in advance. We spent many years pouring our hearts into writing and producing our work and saving monies in order to publish, but all we have been left with is debt and lost dreams.</p>
<p>We find ourselves now trying to recover our resources through civil
action. We are finding the cost prohibitive but want to hold the company
responsible for making good on its contract and many promises. We also want to
stop this company from doing this again. Since we started fighting back the

during his life he will always have to take medication and pay attention for his general health. </span></span></p><p><span><span>After his transplant he also had tumor moisture in the brains and a immune disease. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Yannis his cousin died of a heart disease at age 5.</span></span></p><p><span><span>The MOM of Yannis has also experienced a lot, she got a heart and

bewogen leven achter de rug. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Yannis is hartpatient en onderging een noodzakelijke harttransplantatie op slechts 7-jarige leeftijd.</span></span></p><p><span><span>De transplantatie heeft zijn leven gered en daarna volgde een zware revalidatie.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Zijn leven zal voor altijd 'anders' zijn dan andere kinderen. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Tijdens zijn levensloop zal hij bijvoorbeeld altijd medicatie moeten nemen en goed opletten voor zijn algemene gezondheid.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Zo kreeg Yannis na zijn transplantatie nog af te rekenen met tumorvocht in de hersenen en een immuunziekte. </span></span></p><p><span><span>Het neefje van Yannis stierf op 5 jarige leeftijd.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Ook de mama van Yannis heeft al heel wat meegemaakt, zij kreeg buiten een hart en niertransplantatie ook een pacemaker en verschillende stents om de vernauwingen aan de hartaders open te houden.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Bovendien heeft ze ook nog eens af te rekenen met een spierziekte.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Het leven voor dit gezin is dan ook enorm aangetast door al deze omstandigheden.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Tom (papa van Yannis) is vooral bekend van zijn werk in het Tour Management van verschillende nationale en internationale artiesten, bands, ...</span></span></p><p><span><span>Soms duikt hij ook eens op met een gastrol in een theaterstuk, televisieserie of film.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Zijn contacten in de entertainment en de tegenslag in het leven brachten hem op het idee om deze foundation op te richten samen met zijn zoon en de medewerking van vele anderen.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Er zijn immers nog te veel zieke kinderen die hun dagen moeten doorbrengen in het hospitaal.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Sommige onder hen verlaten het hospitaal zelfs nooit meer...</span></span></p><p><span><span>En daar willen we iets aan doen! </span></span></p><p><span><span>Onze T &amp; Y Foundation steunt de zieke kinderen en helpt naar het onderzoek van bepaalde (hart)ziektes.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Er zal ook worden gezorgd voor entertainment om deze kinderen het zo aangenaam mogelijk te maken 'in de mate van het mogelijke'.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Laat ons samen een hart hebben voor deze kinderen en er voor zorgen dat we als 1 man wereldwijd achter hen staan.</span></span></p><p><span><span>- WE CAN'T CHANGE THE PAST,</span></span></p><p><span><span>BUT WE CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE -</span></span></p><p><span><span>Iedereen die steunt en een lidmaatschap aanschaft zal worden beloond!</span></span></p><p><span><span>Zo geven wij op regelmatige basis, grote maar vooral fantastische prijzen weg.</span></span></p><p><span><span>En er zijn ook schitterende kortingen op

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Loss is unique, in that all individuals will eventually experience it in some form or other. Whenever there is any kind of attachment, if the bond or connection is broken, a loss cannot be avoided. Even when this disconnect is beneficial, such as recovery from addiction, a loss can occur. The loss of friends, family, activities, and coping behaviors that were once acceptable are now severed.</p>
<p>In Part 1 of this book, I discuss various types of losses and perhaps shine some light on those losses that often go unrecognized. A brief overview of the different theoretical perspectives on grief and loss is shared, as well as some of the myths associated with these perspectives.</p>
<p> In Part 2, I provide the reader with an overview of the mind/body/spirit connection among those suffering from grief and loss. This is designed to deepen the reader’s understanding of this connection and provide a framework for addressing this distress, using the various techniques presented in Part 3 of this book.</p>
<p> In Part 3, the reader will be taken on a journey of transformation, using the integrative tools of Energy Psychology, Energy Medicine, rituals for healing, guided imagery, and meditation. I have successfully used these tools in various forms with my clients, workshop/retreat participants, and on myself to transcend the energy of grief and loss.</p>

<p>Pharmakrieg ein dokumentarischer Roman<br/>Um
 mein Vorhaben weiter zu entwickeln habe ich mich entschlossen, ein Buch
 zu schreiben. Es enthält eine spannende, kriminalistische Geschichte 
über pharmazeutische Vermarktungsmethoden, die Menschen helfen soll, die
 möglichen Konsequenzen für sich einzuschätzen. In einem weiteren Teil 
erhalten sie Informationen, die ihnen helfen, mit Nebenwirkungen 
umzugehen, die oft genug das Leben der Betroffenen dramatisch verändern 
können.</p>
<p>Das Buch ist fertig geschrieben und inhaltlich geprüft. 
Zwei Verlage haben sich bereit erklärt, es zu veröffentlichen . Es wird 
auch als eBook für alle Plattformen verfügbar sein.</p>
<p>Ab dem 
Jahr 2014 wird das Buch ins Englische übersetzt, sodass es auch im 
englischsprachigen Raum verlegt werden kann. Bleiben sie also bei uns, 
dieses Projekt wird weiter entwickelt.</p>
<p>Welche Bedeutung ""Pharmakrieg"" für mich hat.<br/>Das
 Projekt ist für mich deshalb besonders wichtig, weil ich der 
Überzeugung bin, dass Medizin mit Ethik und nichts mit Kommerz zu tun 
hat. Medizin zu kommerzialisieren hilft Menschen nicht, es schadet 
ihnen. Ich möchte dazu beitragen, das Menschen lernen mit solchen 
Situationen in der Behandlung  umzugehen, die Gefahren zu erkennen und 
zu meiden. Ich bin zu der Überzeugung gelangt, dass es besser ist, den 
Menschen die Augen zu öffnen, als Änderungen über juristischen Schritte 
oder die Politik herbeizuführen. Das habe ich jahrelang vergeblich 
versucht.</p>
<p>Was Sie erreichen, wenn die diese Kampagne unterstützen.<br/>Indem
 Sie diese Kampagne unterstützen helfen Sie Menschen diese Gefahren 
besser zu erkennen und meiner Überzeugung nach, mehr auf ihre Gesundheit
 zu achten. Es ist immer besser, gesund zu bleiben, als Krankheiten zu 
behandeln.<br/><br/>Was wir benötigen und wofür es aufgewendet werden wird.<br/>Bitte beachten Sie, dass die Kosten in US Dollar angegeben werden. Ich kann in indiegogo nur eine Währung für die Kampagne angeben. Nur in dieser Währung kann eine Zuwendung erfolgen.<br/><br/>1. Druckkosten                                                    11.500, - $<br/>2. Kosten für Marketing *                                       2.700, - $<br/>2.

 Die Vermarktung wird primär durch den  Verlag erfolgen. Dies umfasst 
den Vertrieb an Wiederverkäufer, Veröffentlichung als eBook, Messen, 
Ausstellungen usw. Zusätzlich habe ich vor eine Facebook-, Twitter- und 
Linkedin Kampagne zu erstellen. Mit den angegebenen Kosten für das 
Marketing sind die Kosten für diese Kampagne gemeint.</span></p>
<p>Lektorat
 und Druck wird ca. 2 Monate nachdem die Indiegogo Kampagne beendet ist,
 abgeschlossen sein. Das Buch wird also im Januar / Februar 2014 in 
Deutschland veröffentlicht werden.</p>
<p>Die Übersetzung 
von ""PharmaKrieg"" wird im  Januar 2014 beginnen. Nachdem dies geschehen 
ist, wird das eBook in Englisch unmittelbar zur Verfügung gestellt 
werden. Anschließend muss ein Verleger in den USA identifiziert werden.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><b><br/></b><br/><br/><h2>Pharmawars English Version:</h2>

and do so already for many years.</span><br/><br/><span>Poeple who become victims of pharmaceutical fraud not

Kontakt/ Contact: indiegogo@medicalethics.euMein Name ist Roland Holtz. Wie schon im Film beschreiben, bin ich ehemalisger Mitarbeiter der Pharmaindustrie. Ich habe die Pharmaindustrie im Jahr 2004 aus ethischen Gründen verlassen. Der immer stärker werdende Wettbewerb innerhalb der Pharmaindustrie und dessen Auswirkungen auf Patienten, haben mich zum Pharmakritiker werden lassen.
Menschen 
die fehlgeleitetem Pharmamarketing zum Opfer fallen haben sehr oft nicht
 die Kenntnisse, um mit den Konsequenzen, die daraus für sie erwachsen, 
umzugehen. Ich habe mich entschlossen, ihnen zu helfen. Ich habe in 
Presse und Fernsehen bereits dazu Stellung genommen. Der folgende 
Filmbeitrag ist ein Bespiel dafür.Weiter Beispiele finden Sie hierhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6WLVLCQYpQhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOjLluYcH3Qhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuvBSEJkOHQ
Pharmakrieg ein dokumentarischer RomanUm
 mein Vorhaben weiter zu entwickeln habe ich mich entschlossen, ein Buch
 zu schreiben. Es enthält eine spannende, kriminalistische Geschichte 
über pharmazeutische Vermarktungsmethoden, die Menschen helfen soll, die
 möglichen Konsequenzen für sich einzuschätzen. In einem weiteren Teil 
erhalten sie Informationen, die ihnen helfen, mit Nebenwirkungen 
umzugehen, die oft genug das Leben der Betroffenen dramatisch verändern 
können.
Das Buch ist fertig geschrieben und inhaltlich geprüft. 
Zwei Verlage haben sich bereit erklärt, es zu veröffentlichen . Es wird 
auch als eBook für alle Plattformen verfügbar sein.
Ab dem 
Jahr 2014 wird das Buch ins Englische übersetzt, sodass es auch im 
englischsprachigen Raum verlegt werden kann. Bleiben sie also bei uns, 
dieses Projekt wird weiter entwickelt.
Welche Bedeutung ""Pharmakrieg"" für mich hat.Das
 Projekt ist für mich deshalb besonders wichtig, weil ich der 
Überzeugung bin, dass Medizin mit Ethik und nichts mit Kommerz zu tun 
hat. Medizin zu kommerzialisieren hilft Menschen nicht, es schadet 
ihnen. Ich möchte dazu beitragen, das Menschen lernen mit solchen 
Situationen in der Behandlung  umzugehen, die Gefahren zu erkennen und 
zu meiden. Ich bin zu der Überzeugung gelangt, dass es besser ist, den 
Menschen die Augen zu öffnen, als Änderungen über juristischen Schritte 
oder die Politik herbeizuführen. Das habe ich jahrelang vergeblich 
versucht.
Was Sie erreichen, wenn die diese Kampagne unterstützen.Indem
 Sie diese Kampagne unterstützen helfen Sie Menschen diese Gefahren 
besser zu erkennen und meiner Überzeugung nach, mehr auf ihre Gesundheit
 zu achten. Es ist immer besser, gesund zu bleiben, als Krankheiten zu 
behandeln.Was wir benötigen und wofür es aufgewendet werden wird.Bitte beachten Sie, dass die Kosten in US Dollar angegeben werden. Ich kann in indiegogo nur eine Währung für die Kampagne angeben. Nur in dieser Währung kann eine Zuwendung erfolgen.1. Druckkosten                                                    11.500, - $2.

Pharmawars Summary
My name is Roland Holtz from Hannover in Germany. As said in the movies
I am a former pharmaceutical professional. I left the industry in 2004 for
ethical reasons. Unless the pharmaceutical competition became ever fierce over
the last decades, even up to now, I started to criticise this industry publicly
and do so already for many years.Poeple who become victims of pharmaceutical fraud not
having the proper knowledge, often times have difficulties to deal with these
situations. I decided to assist them. Please view this little film, where You
can see me doing this on TV in Germany.
Pharmawars a documentary novel

To go even further, I decided to write a book named
""Pharmawars"". It is a novel, that contains a compelling story about
pharma fraud, helping people to understand the possible consequences for them
and also containing a second part, with information helping them to cope with
side effects, that in the end can change their life dramatically.
The book is ready to be published and 2 publishers are
willing to print and sell it. Of course, ""pharmawars"" will be
available as eBook of any kind.
Starting with 2014 ""Pharmawars"" will be
translated into English, so it can be published in English speaking countries
as well. So please do stay with us, this project will go on. Publishing it in
Germany will only be the first step.Why is ""Pharmawars"" so important to me?
I feel ethics is the one and only fundament of
medicine. Commercializing medicine does not help people, it harms them. Reality
however is, that medicine has been commercialized in many ways. This results in
painful situations for many.
I am concerned about is the individual. Compensation,
after side effects have occurred, never compensate health or life. The key
issue is to prevent harm. We can only do so by knowing, what is potentially
harmful. If new drugs are potentially harmful, what do I have to do, after it
has been suggested for therapy or prescribed? ""Pharmawars"" is

<p><b>ABOUT THE
STORY</b></p>
<p><b>THE PITS –<i>You Can Run</i></b></p>
<p>This book-in-production is the
sequel to <b>THE PITS</b> and takes up the
story after Captain Kramer, USMC and Sergeant Shadow, USMC have almost died
while assisting the FBI in Operation Slam-Dunk to bring down Valdiron, a major
crime boss.</p>
<p>Kramer must decide whether or
not to re-enlist in the Corps now that he has put in his 20 years of service.
It’s a major crossroad in his life, and his decision cannot be rushed in to.
Suddenly his services are requested once again by the FBI. They are hell-bent
to bring Valdiron to justice and crush his empire founded on blood money from
dogfighting, drugs, and gun trafficking.</p>
<p>What begins as a ‘normal’ FBI
investigation to track down the crime boss turns into a frantic bid to rescue
young children from the horrific exploitation as victims of an extensive human
trafficking ring – the latest and most profitable venture undertaken by
Valdiron. </p>
<p>This is one battle that Captain
Kramer and Sergeant Shadow feel they must tackle. Do they have a choice? Will
this operation prove more successful than the last?</p>
<p><b>WHAT MAKES
THIS STORY UNIQUE?</b></p>
<p>The U.S. Marine Corps is not in
the habit of ‘loaning’ its people out. But a precedent was established in <b>THE PITS</b>, the first book of this
series. How often have you read of a U.S. Marine and his buddy, a dog (and a
Sergeant, USMC, to boot!) becoming involved in major crime-busting escapades? </p>
<p>I have done/and still doing
extensive research into the modes of human trafficking specific to this plot, specifically
to educate the reader on the multi-faceted nature of this insidious worldwide
criminal activity.</p>
<p>I hope that readers of <b>THE PITS – <i>You Can Run</i></b> will be inflamed to act. When
you reach the last page it need not be the end of the story. There is more to

<h3>What Is a Poetry Collective?</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are a mentorship model literary press, bringing new poetic voices from India to the world. The (Great) Indian Poetry Collective is a not-for-profit, shared work literary press publishing and promoting poets with a connection to India/Indian diaspora.</p>
<p>The (Great) Indian Poetry Collective has been powered by community from the beginning.  We're honored to have amazing poets on our advisory board:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p>Meena Alexander<br/>Sampurna Chattarji<br/>Eunice de Souza<br/>Carolyn Forché<br/>Ranjit Hoskote<br/>Jerry Pinto<br/>Sudeep Sen<br/>Ravi Shankar<br/>Prageeta Sharma<br/>Arundhathi Subramaniam</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How We Nurture Poets and Grow Poetry <br/>
</h3>
<p>Under our peer mentorship model, new poets are paired with published poets to hone and fine-tune their manuscripts through a rigorous editorial process, leading to publication. Once a manuscript is ready, the poet is involved in all aspects of layout and design, working with talented graphic designers and artists. Poets who join the collective are never asked
to fund the printing of their books. They give back
what they have received in terms of time – one year of mentorship to a new
collective member. We will publish approximately three books
per year – that’s three new poetic voices from India that we can introduce to
the world! <br/></p><p>In addition, our workshops, talks and readings reach hundreds of aspiring poets as well as poetry lovers. We've held wildly popular workshops at literary festivals, colleges, and bookstores in India as well as in the United States. Our app, <i>inPoetry</i>, will launch next month, bringing contemporary Indian poets directly to smartphone readers everywhere.  Poets emerge from working with us — whether in a one-day workshop or during a two-year commitment as a collective member — more confident and empowered to bring their skills to the wider poetry world. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1038779/files/20141122162137-10448500_10152965024941802_3423141686769917080_o.jpg?1416702097"" src="""" style=""""/></p><blockquote>Participants in our poetry workshop THE NAMES WE CARRY at Kearny Street Workshop, Oakland, November 2014</blockquote>

What Is a Poetry Collective?


We are a mentorship model literary press, bringing new poetic voices from India to the world. The (Great) Indian Poetry Collective is a not-for-profit, shared work literary press publishing and promoting poets with a connection to India/Indian diaspora.
The (Great) Indian Poetry Collective has been powered by community from the beginning.  We're honored to have amazing poets on our advisory board:

Meena AlexanderSampurna ChattarjiEunice de SouzaCarolyn ForchéRanjit HoskoteJerry PintoSudeep SenRavi ShankarPrageeta SharmaArundhathi Subramaniam


How We Nurture Poets and Grow Poetry 

Under our peer mentorship model, new poets are paired with published poets to hone and fine-tune their manuscripts through a rigorous editorial process, leading to publication. Once a manuscript is ready, the poet is involved in all aspects of layout and design, working with talented graphic designers and artists. Poets who join the collective are never asked
to fund the printing of their books. They give back
what they have received in terms of time – one year of mentorship to a new
collective member. We will publish approximately three books
per year – that’s three new poetic voices from India that we can introduce to
the world! In addition, our workshops, talks and readings reach hundreds of aspiring poets as well as poetry lovers. We've held wildly popular workshops at literary festivals, colleges, and bookstores in India as well as in the United States. Our app, inPoetry, will launch next month, bringing contemporary Indian poets directly to smartphone readers everywhere.  Poets emerge from working with us — whether in a one-day workshop or during a two-year commitment as a collective member — more confident and empowered to bring their skills to the wider poetry world. Participants in our poetry workshop THE NAMES WE CARRY at Kearny Street Workshop, Oakland, November 2014

<p>The <b>Chapter One Young Writers Conference (Ch1Con) </b>is just what it sounds like: a writing conference for young writers.</p>
<p>Founded in 2012, the first conference took place in Chicago with six teenagers attending in person and countless others attending via an online live stream. It was an experiment limited to members of the Scholastic’s Write It community and their friends: Could a group of teenagers from across North America really get together and run their own conference? Like, with worthwhile and informative presentations, and networking, and all the cool stuff of a writing conference for adults?</p>
<p>The answer soon became apparent: Yes.</p>
<p>And so the Chapter One Young Writers Conference was born.</p>
<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Too often young adults who write are criticized, pushed aside, and told that their writing is worthless and meaningless, and that the books they often read (e.g. young adult literature) are nothing more than fluff. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>We, at Ch1Con, refute that. We not only support young writers, but we believe in their ability to succeed. Why? It's simple. We're a writing conference for young adults by young adults. So when we say we've been there, we truly have. </p>
<p><b>Help us change what it means to be a young writer.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/994343/files/20141107085318-ch1con2014.jpg?1415379198"" src="""" style=""width: 508px; height: 381px;""/><br/></b></p>

We hope to not only be able to bring more of them to speak at our conference, but to be able to pay them for the time they give.  We are, after all, students too! </span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Support teen writers: </b>Young writers need a strong
and supportive community to grow. We hope to be able to create opportunities
for writers to share and communicate year-round online, and to provide guidance
for those who need it—a mission that will culminate annually at our conference
outside Chicago. <b><br/></b></span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Charge less: </b>While we've always striven to make Ch1Con as affordable as possible, we know in the past it's still been too expensive for many young writers to attend. Through this campaign, we hope to cover many of the expenses of the conference, so that we'll be able to charge only the smallest of registration fees while simultaneously setting up scholarships so that even more talented teens and young adults are able to attend. <b><br/></b></span></li>

<p>All funds will go directly to the conference. If we do not reach our intended goal, funds will first go towards paying our amazing speakers and then towards lowering the registration fee for our talented attendees.</p>

</div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Writing is incredibly important to many teenagers. They spend math class scribbling plot ideas in the margins of their notebooks and type scenes deep into the night. They dream of seeing their work one day in bookstores. <br/></p><p>And not only do they dream: they're ready and willing to do whatever it takes to make that dream a reality.<br/></p><p>According to <a href=""www.ywp.nanowrimo.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">National Novel Writing Month's Young Writers Program</a>, in 2013 <b>nearly 90,000 young writers wrote novels</b> during NaNoWriMo. And the number's only growing. <br/></p><p><b>The <a href=""http://www.pewinternet.org/2008/04/24/writing-technology-and-teens/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PewResearch Internet Project</a> has found:</b><br/></p> <ul>
<li>""83% of parents of teens feel there is a greater need to write well today than there was 20 years ago.</li>
<li>""86% of teens believe good writing is important to success in life.<br/>
</li>
<li>""Fully 93% of those ages 12-17 say they have done some writing outside of
 school in the past year and more than a third of them write 
consistently and regularly.""</li>
</ul><p>By supporting Ch1Con, you support the hard work and aspirations of these brilliant young writers. They have the drive and talent. Now it's our job to help them hone their abilities and show them what it takes to go from aspiring author to published. </p><p><b>Previous attendees say:</b></p><p>""As someone who's been writing since she was very young, I know that it 
can be difficult to feel accepted in either the writing community or a 
community of people your age. Ch1Con provides an intersection of both, 
giving valuable advice about publishing as well as a community that 
supports you in your passion for writing and is just generally super fun
 to be around, both online and in real life."" -- Ariel Kalati, 18</p><p>""Amidst a hard time in
my life, Ch1Con gave me the chance to let go and just do something I loved. It
renewed my passion for writing and reminded me that there are lots of people
out there with interests and experiences like mine, people I can create
lifelong friendships with. These people, before and after the conference, have
supported me and my writing career through all our difficulties and have
literally changed my life. Ch1Con is one of the most exciting and encouraging
things I've ever done."" -- Kira Budge, 20<br/></p><p>""Ch1Con is a totally
unmatchable experience because of the community that surrounds it. Making
connections with peers is difficult enough for teenagers, so finding a group of
people who share our passion can be invaluable to us. This conference was more
welcoming and enjoyable than I could have ever hoped for. Chapter One accommodated
for writers with all different skill-sets, backgrounds and stories to tell. If
you or a young writer you know is searching for somewhere to belong, this is
the perfect place."" -- Emma Ryan, 16</p><ul> </ul>
<h3></h3><p></p><h3>FAQ</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">GENERAL</p><p><b>Q: Who can attend Ch1Con?</b></p>
<p>A: Anyone middle school through undergraduate, so approximately ages twelve through twenty two.</p><p></p><p><b>Q: I’m under eighteen. Do I need a chaperone?</b></p><p>A: While you’ll need the permission of your legal guardian to attend if you’re under eighteen, you will NOT need a chaperone actually with you at the conference. Think of it sort of like a day camp. (And running with that concept: be aware that you and your legal guardian are responsible for transportation and lodging throughout the weekend.)</p><p><b>Q: What’s Ch1Con’s connection to Teens Can Write, Too?</b></p>
<p>A: We’re partners in bringing kickbutt opportunities to the kickbutt young writers of the world! (Also, the Ch1Con team all writes for TCWT when we’re not busy doing Ch1Con stuff.)</p><div style=""text-align: center;""> <p></p>

</div></div>","What is the CHAPTER ONE YOUNG WRITERS CONFERENCE? 
The Chapter One Young Writers Conference (Ch1Con) is just what it sounds like: a writing conference for young writers.
Founded in 2012, the first conference took place in Chicago with six teenagers attending in person and countless others attending via an online live stream. It was an experiment limited to members of the Scholastic’s Write It community and their friends: Could a group of teenagers from across North America really get together and run their own conference? Like, with worthwhile and informative presentations, and networking, and all the cool stuff of a writing conference for adults?
The answer soon became apparent: Yes.
And so the Chapter One Young Writers Conference was born.
Why?
Too often young adults who write are criticized, pushed aside, and told that their writing is worthless and meaningless, and that the books they often read (e.g. young adult literature) are nothing more than fluff. 

We, at Ch1Con, refute that. We not only support young writers, but we believe in their ability to succeed. Why? It's simple. We're a writing conference for young adults by young adults. So when we say we've been there, we truly have. 
Help us change what it means to be a young writer.

Attendees and speakers at Ch1Con 2014.
With your donation, Ch1Con will be able to:



Bring more speakers: There are so many talented young adults out there. We hope to not only be able to bring more of them to speak at our conference, but to be able to pay them for the time they give.  We are, after all, students too! 

Support teen writers: Young writers need a strong
and supportive community to grow. We hope to be able to create opportunities
for writers to share and communicate year-round online, and to provide guidance
for those who need it—a mission that will culminate annually at our conference
outside Chicago. 
Charge less: While we've always striven to make Ch1Con as affordable as possible, we know in the past it's still been too expensive for many young writers to attend. Through this campaign, we hope to cover many of the expenses of the conference, so that we'll be able to charge only the smallest of registration fees while simultaneously setting up scholarships so that even more talented teens and young adults are able to attend. 

All funds will go directly to the conference. If we do not reach our intended goal, funds will first go towards paying our amazing speakers and then towards lowering the registration fee for our talented attendees.

 
 The Impact Writing is incredibly important to many teenagers. They spend math class scribbling plot ideas in the margins of their notebooks and type scenes deep into the night. They dream of seeing their work one day in bookstores. And not only do they dream: they're ready and willing to do whatever it takes to make that dream a reality.According to National Novel Writing Month's Young Writers Program, in 2013 nearly 90,000 young writers wrote novels during NaNoWriMo. And the number's only growing. The PewResearch Internet Project has found: 
""83% of parents of teens feel there is a greater need to write well today than there was 20 years ago.
""86% of teens believe good writing is important to success in life.

""Fully 93% of those ages 12-17 say they have done some writing outside of
 school in the past year and more than a third of them write 
consistently and regularly.""
By supporting Ch1Con, you support the hard work and aspirations of these brilliant young writers. They have the drive and talent. Now it's our job to help them hone their abilities and show them what it takes to go from aspiring author to published. Previous attendees say:""As someone who's been writing since she was very young, I know that it 
can be difficult to feel accepted in either the writing community or a 
community of people your age. Ch1Con provides an intersection of both, 
giving valuable advice about publishing as well as a community that 
supports you in your passion for writing and is just generally super fun
 to be around, both online and in real life."" -- Ariel Kalati, 18""Amidst a hard time in
my life, Ch1Con gave me the chance to let go and just do something I loved. It
renewed my passion for writing and reminded me that there are lots of people
out there with interests and experiences like mine, people I can create
lifelong friendships with. These people, before and after the conference, have
supported me and my writing career through all our difficulties and have
literally changed my life. Ch1Con is one of the most exciting and encouraging
things I've ever done."" -- Kira Budge, 20""Ch1Con is a totally
unmatchable experience because of the community that surrounds it. Making
connections with peers is difficult enough for teenagers, so finding a group of
people who share our passion can be invaluable to us. This conference was more
welcoming and enjoyable than I could have ever hoped for. Chapter One accommodated
for writers with all different skill-sets, backgrounds and stories to tell. If
you or a young writer you know is searching for somewhere to belong, this is
the perfect place."" -- Emma Ryan, 16 
FAQ

<p><strong>About Me and About My Project</strong></p>
<p>Hello out there--</p>
<p>My name is Matthew Murphy and I am a writer and teacher from Sudbury, Ontario, Canada.  I have been writing since I was seven years old and now have a growing body of work that I firmly believe, with your help, will see the light of day and take its place among the literature of today.  I feel and hope that what I write is worth your time and your investment and that together we can help it make its leap into the hum and buzz of the public sphere.</p>
<p>And so, on with the project....</p>
<p>I have written a psychological-historical war novel tentatively titled  <em>Ready, Aye, Ready!</em>, though, in a sense, the novel could be called <em>Edvard Munch’s “The Scream” Goes to War</em> or <em>A Portrait of the Captain as a Nervous Wreck</em>.  The story is intensively centred round the protagonist, Captain James McFarlane, a Canadian infantry officer in the Second World War in the latter days of the Italian Campaign.</p>
<p>In Jim’s shellshocked, slightly feverish mind, past and present and future, dream and reality all conflate and mesh and at times to both himself and the reader become indistinguishable.  He is exhausted, and the style of the novel reflects his fragmenting identity as he tries to command his combat company under fire, and waits with equally baited breath for letters from his wife and orders to attack a well-defended German strongpoint overlooking a vulnerable valley. </p>
<p>Overall, I think that the Canadian military experience in the Second World War has, with few exceptions (such as Colin McDougall’s <em>Execution</em>), not been given a direct treatment in literary fiction, unlike the Canadian experience in the First World War.  I feel that the intensity and vividness that I bring to the time and place and the perspective of the protagonist give the novel a tone that is alternately cerebral and visceral, unsettling and gripping, that together propel it strongly with push-pull tension between the larger perspective of the war as a whole and the private perspective of Captain McFarlane. </p>
<p>I honestly believe that there is nothing quite like it in today's fiction.  Interested?  Need more convincing?  Here, have a sneak peak inside:  <a href=""http://murphilinear.com/?page_id=5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://murphilinear.com/?page_id=5</a></p>

<h2 class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-align: justify;""></h2></div>","Introducing “Monitoring the Monitors”
For many people, an ankle bracelet is an “accessory” worn by Martha Stewart or Lindsay Lohan. But it’s a little more complicated than that. Every day about 200,000 people wake up on a monitoring device as a result of a criminal justice matter. 
 What is life like for people on electronic monitoring?  
Does monitoring give people an opportunity to turn their lives around or is it yet another way for businesses to make money out of “corrections”? 
 These monitors can track people’s every move.  
 What happens to that information? 
 Who “owns” it? 
            These are questions I will tackle in the articles, blog postings, videos and ultimately the book that will grow out of this project.  I will be “monitoring the monitors” by traveling to different parts of the country and telling the stories of the people who have lived with this technological tether. 
Why does this matter?
We have far too many people in prisons and jails in this country, far too many people of color in particular. I want that number to decrease rapidly. But I also want to ensure that the “alternatives to incarceration” we develop actually give people an opportunity to get their life on track. 
Stories of Monitoring

I have heard many stories from people on monitoring who have been virtually chained to their houses while on an ankle bracelet-unable to work or take part in family activities. How common is this? Do we run the risk of incarcerating people in their homes instead of inside cells? Are some places doing electronic monitoring better than others? If so, what can we learn from them?
 
Follow the Money
There is big money in electronic monitoring. Who will be making that money? Who do they hope to put on monitors and for how long? Is there any way to make sure monitoring is done for justice reasons and not to earn dividends for shareholders?
Net Widening: Who is next?
Already we have some suspicious uses of electronic monitoring- ankle bracelets for school children who are truant in Texas, ankle bracelets for immigrants awaiting court decisions in Massachusetts, ankle bracelets for life for people with certain sex offenses in California. Are these ensuring public safety?  How do we control this “net widening” – the expansion of monitoring to people who don’t really need to be monitored?
My Plan
I will travel to what I call the “hot spots” of electronic monitoring. I will capture the stories of people in California, Texas, Michigan, Colorado, Illinois, Washington DC and compile them into online articles, video interviews, print media articles and posts to my blog at voiceofthemonitored.com.  Ultimately they will become part of a book. I have six publishers interested but I need your support to do the research. 

What I hope to achieve
I want to contribute to a national dialog on alternatives to incarceration. (contact me at waazn1@gmail.com )My project will bring to light voices we rarely hear-people who have been incarcerated, people who walk our streets every day with a black plastic box strapped to their ankle. What is life like for them? How can we make sure things get better?  How do we ensure they don’t end up back behind bars?  If we are to construct meaningful alternatives to the present situation, we need to hear the experiences of those who have been on the receiving end. 
What I Need 
I am requesting $4,000 to cover my expenses to travel to CA, TX, MI, CO, and DC.  Most of this will go for airfares and road transportation.  I will stay with friends in most cities, eat at healthy cheap places, carry a jar of crunchy peanut butter and a pack of apples everywhere I go.  I am not a rock star travelling with an entourage. You won’t find me poolside at the Hilton. 
Other than travel, I will buys a few incidentals a researcher needs-some books, some toner for my printer, reams of paper, notepads and phone cards (yes, they do come in handy if cell reception is bad). 
If I exceed my funding goal I will work with a local video producer to compile a video on monitoring, featuring excerpts from the interviews I conduct.  
Why I Will Succeed

I am an experienced writer and researcher. I have written articles on mass incarceration and electronic monitoring. You can check a couple of them here. I have interviewed many people about electronic monitoring (check a sample here).  I have been running a blog on monitoring for over a year. I have also published three novels (check them here and here).  
Plus, I have the added (mis) fortune of having spent a year on electronic monitoring as a condition of parole. I know this subject from the inside and the outside.  I am determined to make it succeed, to flood you with the stories behind the ankle bracelet and eventually hand over a copy of a book on this important topic. 
Other ways you can help
I am not only looking for your financial contribution.  I also want to dialog with you about alternatives to incarceration. I would especially like to hear from you if you or a loved one or a friend has been on electronic monitoring. We need  your stories if we want to make meaningful change. 
Rewards 


I am a writer. I wish I knew how to design a beautiful poster or weave you a magic carpet for your living room floor.  But I don’t. Words are my tools, so most of my rewards are the unpublished fruit of my various writing projects-poems, essays, short stories, plus paperback copies of my novels.  This is a big research project which will take a year to complete. And another year to get a book into print. I will give you updates and stories along the way but you may not want to wait that long for rewards. This is why I am using my previous writings. However, I will keep you informed of and linked to anything I publish from this research.

<p><b>Conversations of the Crucifixion</b></p>
<p>My name is Darrius Jerome Gourdine, author of “<i>Conversations of the Crucifixion</i>”. This
book is an exciting and innovative exploratory look at the crucifixion of Jesus
from a creative perspective. Imagine if the items used in the crucifixion could
speak? What would they say? What would the cross say? What would the nails say?
What if you could interview the people that Jesus came into contact with during
that week? What would they say? What would Judas say? What would Peter want you

My name is Darrius Jerome Gourdine, author of “Conversations of the Crucifixion”. This
book is an exciting and innovative exploratory look at the crucifixion of Jesus
from a creative perspective. Imagine if the items used in the crucifixion could
speak? What would they say? What would the cross say? What would the nails say?
What if you could interview the people that Jesus came into contact with during
that week? What would they say? What would Judas say? What would Peter want you
to know?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Madde Stager, and I have been involved in healing in one form or another for my entire life.  I recently graduated with my Master's of Science in Acupuncture from Tri-State College of Acupuncutre in New York City and began Dyanmic Living Acupuncture, as well as being a certified level 2 Reiki practitioner.  I have worked with various transformational companies for the past 5 years, coaching people to create dynamic and extraordinary results in their lives.  Healing is what I am passionate about.  I have been thinking about the best way that I can touch the most lives and make the biggest difference in the world, and this book came to me. </p>
<p>I am offereing people a set of tools and information that is easy to understand, and they can take into their day-to-day lives.  The purpose of this book is to create healing on a deep and profound level as people re-discover their true nature and get in touch with their authenticity.  I believe that when people experience themselves in their perfection, then inner conflict will cease to exist and therefore will lead to peace on a global level.</p>

 were hundreds of writers creating a very supportive and inspiring 
atmosphere at #SFWC2015. Some of the classes included voice, author 
platform, technology, and developing a writing routine, or how to fit 
all the above into our daily lives. In going to SFWC, I gained a better 
understanding of the writing profession. While part of that involved 
publishing, legalities, what the reader is getting, all of which 
empowered me. I can do this! But then there was the undeniable look on 
an author’s face when a reader purchased their book—an expression of childlike 
excitement that as adults we still have when someone says “I believe in 
you,” or “good job.” The reader needs the writer, and the writer needs 
the reader. To sum up the conference, it was about the full circle of 
events and creating a supportive community, and that’s how it ended, 
joining the community. <span><em><span><br/>Thank you</span></em></span><em> again to my family, friends, and people believing in my journey. Because of your support in more ways than one, I attended the </em><em>San Francisco Writers </em><em>Conference. </em><em><em>It was Amazing!</em></em></em></p><p><em><em>Mom

</p><p>I’m Jennifer Trimmings. 
I’m a forty-something college graduate—though the last six years has made
me feel a bit older. Wiser? Maybe. Empathetic? Compassionate? Yes! For these
past six years, I’ve balanced college (where I obtained a Masters degree in
History), work (I'm a self-employed seamstress), and family, including a mother
diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease. As I watched my once-vigorous
mother suffer, I remembered who she was earlier in her life, and wondered what
she was going through. I worried what she understood, but could no longer
express, whom I might become in ten to fifteen years myself. </p>
<p>During the worst
of Mom’s Alzheimer’s, my stepfather died suddenly. Afterward,
I found a binder filled with love letters from their courtship. Though I never
read the letters, they spurred memories of other loves and losses. These
courtship letters also inspired me to write vignettes about my life with Mom,
and our experiences with Alzheimer’s. </p>
<p>The result is <i>Life Loop</i>, an emotionally raw memoir presenting
my experiences with life and death decisions for Mom, and how my life with her
influenced my choices as an adult, as her daughter, ultimately strengthening me.
</p>
<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>Some of you have been where I’ve
been, losing a parent to Alzheimer’s. Or you might be one day. I wrote <i>Life Loop</i> to understand and heal after
my mother's death. Most of all, I wrote <i>Life
Loop</i> to remember Mom: who she was, who I am because of her. </p>
<p>After completing
my first draft, I nervously shared it with a few friends. I didn’t anticipate the
positive response I would receive: “I thought I only felt like that. I don’t
feel so alone now.” “You described what I was feeling. You helped me heal.” “I
want to write a memoir to help me heal. Can you help?” “If it helped me, it can
help others too. I really hope you publish it.”</p>
<p><b>Help</b></p>
<p>That is why I’m here asking for
help. Now that I have a completed draft of <i>Life
Loop</i>, I'd really like to attend the February 2015 San Francisco Writers
Conference, which provides workshops in memoir publishing, as well as
introductions to agents and editors. Last fall I applied for a scholarship to attend
the conference. I was one of five semi-finalists. While I’m excited I got that
far, I did not receive the scholarship. And so I still need funding to attend
the conference. This is where you come in: With your help, I’d love to attend
the conference with high hopes of getting my memoir <i>Life Loop </i>seen and published. </p>
<p>  Mom
suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. I’m her memory now. Please help me take this
crucial step in sharing her story, my story, with the world, so I can help
other people heal. </p>
<p>With deep appreciation, </p>
<p>Jennifer Trimmings  </p>
<p>If you’re inclined, please share my
link. Thank you.</p>
<p><b><b> <i>Life Loop</i></b> :   Chapter Excepts —</b></p>
<p><b>Chapter One:</b></p>
<p>I have lived in
four states. Different sights: snow and slush, green and lush, East Coast, West,
dry and desolate with a mountain’s view, or an ocean’s vastness going on
forever. Different smells: first snow, fragrant tropical moistness in the air,
rain on a resistant desert landscape that oozes the smell of Creosote, Pacific
Ocean and Eucalyptus scenting from my backyard.<span>  I have lived in four different states, states of mind,
states of place. Was I prepared for this, ready for this? Are we ever ready?</span></p>
<p><b>Chapter Three:</b></p>

<p>Dear Mom,</p>
<p><span> I
don’t know if I should be writing this to you, but it’s how I feel. I’m glad
you’re comfortable now, or a least you appear to be comfortable, not agitated,
not in pain. Though I can’t help wanting to see your fight, see your anger again. Because, then I know you haven’t given up, that
there’s a chance you might survive, beat this thing, Alzheimer’s.  But from everything I’ve heard or read,
it seems impossible. But then so much in life seems impossible, and yet you
taught me that things aren’t, if you believe and try hard. But you can’t try
hard anymore. I know this, but I don’t believe this.</span></p>
<p>Love always,</p>
<p>Jen</p>
<br/></div>","I'm back home from the San Francisco Writers Conference 2015!                 There
 were hundreds of writers creating a very supportive and inspiring 
atmosphere at #SFWC2015. Some of the classes included voice, author 
platform, technology, and developing a writing routine, or how to fit 
all the above into our daily lives. In going to SFWC, I gained a better 
understanding of the writing profession. While part of that involved 
publishing, legalities, what the reader is getting, all of which 
empowered me. I can do this! But then there was the undeniable look on 
an author’s face when a reader purchased their book—an expression of childlike 
excitement that as adults we still have when someone says “I believe in 
you,” or “good job.” The reader needs the writer, and the writer needs 
the reader. To sum up the conference, it was about the full circle of 
events and creating a supportive community, and that’s how it ended, 
joining the community. Thank you again to my family, friends, and people believing in my journey. Because of your support in more ways than one, I attended the San Francisco Writers Conference. It was Amazing!Mom
 suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. I’m her memory now. Going to the 
conference was a crucial step.  Now I'm prepared to take my next steps in sharing her story, my story, and in 
that way helping other people heal.
With deep appreciation,                               Jennifer  Life Loop, Alzheimer's made me
remember                                                        Hi!
I’m Jennifer Trimmings. 
I’m a forty-something college graduate—though the last six years has made
me feel a bit older. Wiser? Maybe. Empathetic? Compassionate? Yes! For these
past six years, I’ve balanced college (where I obtained a Masters degree in
History), work (I'm a self-employed seamstress), and family, including a mother
diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease. As I watched my once-vigorous
mother suffer, I remembered who she was earlier in her life, and wondered what
she was going through. I worried what she understood, but could no longer
express, whom I might become in ten to fifteen years myself. 
During the worst
of Mom’s Alzheimer’s, my stepfather died suddenly. Afterward,
I found a binder filled with love letters from their courtship. Though I never
read the letters, they spurred memories of other loves and losses. These
courtship letters also inspired me to write vignettes about my life with Mom,
and our experiences with Alzheimer’s. 
The result is Life Loop, an emotionally raw memoir presenting
my experiences with life and death decisions for Mom, and how my life with her
influenced my choices as an adult, as her daughter, ultimately strengthening me.

Why?
Some of you have been where I’ve
been, losing a parent to Alzheimer’s. Or you might be one day. I wrote Life Loop to understand and heal after
my mother's death. Most of all, I wrote Life
Loop to remember Mom: who she was, who I am because of her. 
After completing
my first draft, I nervously shared it with a few friends. I didn’t anticipate the
positive response I would receive: “I thought I only felt like that. I don’t
feel so alone now.” “You described what I was feeling. You helped me heal.” “I
want to write a memoir to help me heal. Can you help?” “If it helped me, it can
help others too. I really hope you publish it.”
Help
That is why I’m here asking for
help. Now that I have a completed draft of Life
Loop, I'd really like to attend the February 2015 San Francisco Writers
Conference, which provides workshops in memoir publishing, as well as
introductions to agents and editors. Last fall I applied for a scholarship to attend
the conference. I was one of five semi-finalists. While I’m excited I got that
far, I did not receive the scholarship. And so I still need funding to attend
the conference. This is where you come in: With your help, I’d love to attend
the conference with high hopes of getting my memoir Life Loop seen and published. 
  Mom
suffered from Alzheimer’s disease. I’m her memory now. Please help me take this
crucial step in sharing her story, my story, with the world, so I can help
other people heal. 
With deep appreciation, 
Jennifer Trimmings  
If you’re inclined, please share my
link. Thank you.
 Life Loop :   Chapter Excepts —
Chapter One:
I have lived in
four states. Different sights: snow and slush, green and lush, East Coast, West,
dry and desolate with a mountain’s view, or an ocean’s vastness going on
forever. Different smells: first snow, fragrant tropical moistness in the air,
rain on a resistant desert landscape that oozes the smell of Creosote, Pacific
Ocean and Eucalyptus scenting from my backyard.  I have lived in four different states, states of mind,
states of place. Was I prepared for this, ready for this? Are we ever ready?
Chapter Three:
Sitting in a second floor office, I look over the Alzheimer’s
Association pamphlets and listen to the female advocate in the chair across
from me. “The disease can take eight to twelve years before it gets to its
final stages. How long has your mom had Alzheimer’s?” I open the pamphlet to
the symptom progression chart.  Cognitive
reasoning, she’s lost her sense of humor. I’ve noticed that she only laughs
because she’s covering up the fact that she doesn’t understand something. I

bubble above her head. Having a conversation? She doesn’t follow, has no
sense of boundaries, and isn’t controlling her emotions. She has no sense of
what is appropriate, cursing at will or without will, and either extremely
sweet or angry, mistrust.  I
look back up at the representative. “I think it may be as long as eight years
already.”…. Mom is young, sixty-eight, and barely knows me.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Les Éditions Matopée</strong> est la première maison d'édition 100% numérique de la ville de Québec. Fondée en janvier 2013, nous nous spécialisons exclusivement dans l'édition d'ouvrages de fiction sur supports électroniques.</p>
<p>La littérature est un art qui, depuis l'invention de l'écriture, fait rêver et permet à des auteurs talentueux de diffuser leurs imaginaires à travers les mots. Le papier a toujours été le compagnon préféré de la plume, et rien ne pourrait nous faire mentir à ce sujet. Cependant, dans un monde nouvellement technologique comme le nôtre, il est primordial de donner à la littérature une nouvelle facette: celle du numérique.</p>
<p><strong>La littérature numérique est pratique, accessible, économique, versatile et inventive.</strong> Elle permet d'apporter avec soi, dans le creux d'une main, des milliers de livres et de les consulter sur le pouce. Imaginez: vous êtes dans votre chambre d'hôtel, à des kilomètres de votre maison, et vous auriez tant aimé avoir apporté le dernier Bernard Werber. Mais, horreur, vous l'avez laissé dans votre bibliothèque! Avec les livres numériques, votre bibliothèque est constamment dans votre poche et toujours accessible.</p>
<p>Peur de l'écran? Essayer le livre numérique, c'est l'adopter. Bien sûr, il ne sentira pas comme les pages d'un livre papier. Mais si vous êtes prêt à faire le sacrifice de l'odeur pour avoir accès à des millions d'univers que vous ne retrouveriez jamais ailleurs, vous êtes prêt pur le livre numérique. </p>
<p>Les Éditions Matopée espère aider la littérature à se propager dans de nouveaux esprits grâce à l'accessibilité du numérique. <strong>Nous vendons des oeuvres inédites d'auteurs francophones à des prix dérisoires (tous nos livres coûtent moins de 10$!), tout en redonnant aux auteurs la majorité des profits de ventes.</strong> Nos ouvrages sont édités professionnellement et permettent au lecteur de profiter d'un produit littéraire de haute qualité.</p>
<p>La littérature numérique est peu connue. Notre maison d'édition l'est encore moins. Nous devons donc faire un double travail de promotion. Comment attirer un grand nombre de personnes et les intéresser au livre numérique? En profitant d'une grande vitrine comme le Salon international du livre de Québec. Pour l'édition 2014, nous exigeons d'être présents, d'avoir un espace réservé au nom des Éditions Matopée et de permettre à tous et à toutes de tenter l'expérience du numérique. Ce faisant, nous serions<strong> la première maison d'édition entièrement numérique à présenter ses produits au Salon international du livre de Québec.</strong> Et nous avons besoin de vous pour y arriver!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez:</strong></h3>
<p>Louer un espace au Salon international du livre de Québec coûte 1325$. C'est un prix très élevé que nous ne pouvons nous permettre. Il existe une autre option: le demi-stand, que nous pouvons partager avec une autre maison d'édition. Ceci coûte 725$, un prix fort plus intéressant.</p>
<p>Étant donné que nous n'avons pas de livres papier à exposer, notre espace n'a pas besoin d'être gigantesque. Il suffit d'être présent, intriguant, amusant. De plus, un demi-stand représente bien notre volonté de démontrer que le livre numérique prend tellement peu de place!</p>
<p>Avec un financement atteint de <strong>1600$</strong>, vous permettrez de:</p>
<p>- Payer l'emplacement du demi-stand au Salon (725$)</p>
<p>- Payer la présence constante de l'éditeur comme représentant durant tout l'événement (5 jours d'exposition, totalisant 56 heures de travail à 15$ de l'heure (840$))</p>
<p>Total: <strong>1565$</strong> (que nous arrondissons de bonne foi à 1600$)</p>
<p>Si notre objectif n'est pas atteint au bout de <strong>60 jours</strong>, nous serons tristes et Indiegogo vous remettra votre argent. Cependant, si nous dépassons les 1600$, l'argent supplémentaire servira à aider Les Éditions Matopée dans la continuation de ses activités!</p>
<p>Que vous rapportera votre contribution? <strong>Consultez la liste à votre droite pour plus d'informations.</strong> Sachez que notre catalogue est pour l'instant petit, mais plusieurs nouveaux titres arriveront dans les prochains mois.

<h3>How <a href=""http://www.dangerkidsuniverse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Danger Kids Universe</a> Began</h3>
<p>At 11 years old, <strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/mrdefoster"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">De'Quan Foster</a></strong> wasn't the guy the girls chased after. He wasn't the boy who could play football and basketball really well. The guys who could play really well, picked on him; and the young girls chased those guys. De'Quan was picked on because he didn't speak like the kids his age, and was called a geek because he was smart and liked super heroes.</p>
<p>Being somewhat of a social outcast, De'Quan escaped into a world of imagination and began developing his own cast of super heroes like the stories he loved. It was then that Danger Kids was born. His mentor at the <strong><a href=""http://bgcn.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Newark</a></strong>, <strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/aswashington"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A.S. Washington</a></strong> took interest in him and his story. A.S. Washington gave him advice on life; offered up new characters and plot ideas. 7 characters quickly expanded into a universe of over 100 characters.</p>
<p>As Washington and Foster's relationship progressed, they continued to work on Danger Kids together. In the summer of 2012, more than 6 years from the day that Foster penned the first character; they founded <strong>Brickhouse Publishing</strong> and launched <strong><a href=""http://www.dangerkidsuniverse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dangerkidsuniverse.com</a></strong>. On December 12, 2012, Book 1 of the Danger Kids Universe, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Twelve-A-S-Washington/dp/098588701X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365079502&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=The+Twelve+A.S.+Washington"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><em><strong>The Twelve</strong></em></a> was released. The series is planned to span 12 novels.</p>
<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>With eleven more novels planned for release, production costs can quickly add up. A.S. Washington has been the primary investor of their independent venture, since De'Quan Foster is a recent June-2012 graduate of <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_Park_High_School_%28New_Jersey%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Science Park High School</a></strong>. They've found out that publishing a book is a massive undertaking. It that takes a team of dedicated hands to produce the highest quality product for fans and readers of the series.</p>
<p>However, Danger Kids Universe doesn't stop at novels. There are t-shirts, posters, pens, and mugs as a part of the Danger Kids brand. Currently, Danger Kids Universe is working on soliciting artists to begin producing content for a mobile game app. Yet, without the stories, nothing else much matters. With your help, Washington and Foster wont have to worry about the cost of book production. The two can simply create and have the resources to put forth a product that <strong><a href=""http://www.barnesandnoble.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Barnes and Noble</a></strong> would be happy to place on their shelves when their proposal is submitted. With your generous contribution, Danger Kids can become the next big thing in pop culture.</p>
<p>Yet, the biggest gift your help would bring is helping a young man realize his dream. It will reinforce the notion that no matter where you begin in life, great things can be accomplished. And as De'Quan Foster always says; ""Those who stand up in times of great danger will forever be known as heroes.""</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>For the next 11 installments in the Danger Kids Universe, $55,000 will allow all book production costs to be covered. Those essential items items include but are not limited to:</p>
<p><br/>Book Cover Design</p>
<p>Professional Comprehensive Editing (spelling, grammar, style, word choice, tone of voice, etc)</p>
<p>Professional eBook Conversion (Kindle, Nook, iPad/iPhone, Smashwords etc)</p>
<p>Professional Interior Design/Layout</p>
<p>Expanded Distribution (Online retailers like Barnes and Noble)</p>
<p>Online Marketing &amp; Advertising (Facebook, Twitter, GoogleAds, etc)</p>
<p>Shipping (Sending proof copies to beta readers for suggestions and opinions)</p>
<p>Early Content Production for Mobile App (character sketching/full color art, world sketching)</p>
<p>Branding (Trademark registration, memorabilia, new logos, etc)</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>For your generous gift, we want to make sure you feel like you're a part of Team Danger Kids. Get awesome Danger Kids Universe gear like concept art t-shirts, logo pens from our independent publishing company Brickhouse Publishing, eBooks, and even autographed copies for books in the series. Those are just a few of the awesome things we have lined up for you by helping us bring Danger Kids to the world.</p>
<h3>If We Miss Our Goal, Where Does Your Money Go?</h3>
<p>We at Danger Kids Universe and Brickhouse Publishing are 100% committed to bringing Danger Kids to the world. We know that $55,000 is a huge commitment but it's exactly what we need at this stage. Reaching our goal would ensure that over the next 10-15 years, Danger Kids will be available for order on tablets and mobile devices; and hopefully on shelves at your local bookstore. However, we're realistic and know that goals aren't always reached, but whatever you are able to contribute, we'll put to honest use. All funds raised will be put toward to the cost of production and delivering on the perks we outlined here in our campaign. We want all of our contributors to help us, and we don't ever want to break that trust. Our campaign goal will allows us to bring the highest quality product to the market place for our readers and fans. We'll do that with $20 dollars, or we'll do that with $55,000.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is our hope at Danger Kids Universe to bring a new cast of characters to the world that will have a positive effect on society. We know that in today's technologically advance world, entertainment and information comes blazing at us at warp speeds. But our authors were and still are readers. Before television and computers, reading and writing was humanity's primary means of communication, education, and entertainment. We want kids to read. We want adults to read. We want to make sure that reading is still an important part of entertainment throughout the world.</p>
<p>With the release of The Twelve, we have been able to reached almost two hundred new readers in just a few short months. We've visited elementary and high schools and gave away and sold books to excited readers, both young and adult. We've generated a buzz through social media on Facebook and Twitter. Both De'Quan Foster and A.S. Washington make themselves available to fans through their social media accounts. They're accessible and talk about the books, but also about every day things from movies to music.</p>
<p>Your contribution is important to us and will allow us to continue to bring the world Danger Kids. It will helps us be positive role models and contributors to society through books. Our author's dreams are to be the writers of fiction to a new generation of youth, who can grow up with Danger Kids like so many kids grew up with Luke Skywalker, Superman, Batman and Harry Potter. This is our dream. You can help us to achieve it.</p>

</div></div>","How Danger Kids Universe Began
At 11 years old, De'Quan Foster wasn't the guy the girls chased after. He wasn't the boy who could play football and basketball really well. The guys who could play really well, picked on him; and the young girls chased those guys. De'Quan was picked on because he didn't speak like the kids his age, and was called a geek because he was smart and liked super heroes.
Being somewhat of a social outcast, De'Quan escaped into a world of imagination and began developing his own cast of super heroes like the stories he loved. It was then that Danger Kids was born. His mentor at the Boys & Girls Clubs of Newark, A.S. Washington took interest in him and his story. A.S. Washington gave him advice on life; offered up new characters and plot ideas. 7 characters quickly expanded into a universe of over 100 characters.
As Washington and Foster's relationship progressed, they continued to work on Danger Kids together. In the summer of 2012, more than 6 years from the day that Foster penned the first character; they founded Brickhouse Publishing and launched dangerkidsuniverse.com. On December 12, 2012, Book 1 of the Danger Kids Universe, The Twelve was released. The series is planned to span 12 novels.
The Campaign
With eleven more novels planned for release, production costs can quickly add up. A.S. Washington has been the primary investor of their independent venture, since De'Quan Foster is a recent June-2012 graduate of Science Park High School. They've found out that publishing a book is a massive undertaking. It that takes a team of dedicated hands to produce the highest quality product for fans and readers of the series.
However, Danger Kids Universe doesn't stop at novels. There are t-shirts, posters, pens, and mugs as a part of the Danger Kids brand. Currently, Danger Kids Universe is working on soliciting artists to begin producing content for a mobile game app. Yet, without the stories, nothing else much matters. With your help, Washington and Foster wont have to worry about the cost of book production. The two can simply create and have the resources to put forth a product that Barnes and Noble would be happy to place on their shelves when their proposal is submitted. With your generous contribution, Danger Kids can become the next big thing in pop culture.
Yet, the biggest gift your help would bring is helping a young man realize his dream. It will reinforce the notion that no matter where you begin in life, great things can be accomplished. And as De'Quan Foster always says; ""Those who stand up in times of great danger will forever be known as heroes.""


What We Need
For the next 11 installments in the Danger Kids Universe, $55,000 will allow all book production costs to be covered. Those essential items items include but are not limited to:
Book Cover Design
Professional Comprehensive Editing (spelling, grammar, style, word choice, tone of voice, etc)
Professional eBook Conversion (Kindle, Nook, iPad/iPhone, Smashwords etc)
Professional Interior Design/Layout
Expanded Distribution (Online retailers like Barnes and Noble)
Online Marketing & Advertising (Facebook, Twitter, GoogleAds, etc)
Shipping (Sending proof copies to beta readers for suggestions and opinions)
Early Content Production for Mobile App (character sketching/full color art, world sketching)
Branding (Trademark registration, memorabilia, new logos, etc)
What You Get
For your generous gift, we want to make sure you feel like you're a part of Team Danger Kids. Get awesome Danger Kids Universe gear like concept art t-shirts, logo pens from our independent publishing company Brickhouse Publishing, eBooks, and even autographed copies for books in the series. Those are just a few of the awesome things we have lined up for you by helping us bring Danger Kids to the world.
If We Miss Our Goal, Where Does Your Money Go?
We at Danger Kids Universe and Brickhouse Publishing are 100% committed to bringing Danger Kids to the world. We know that $55,000 is a huge commitment but it's exactly what we need at this stage. Reaching our goal would ensure that over the next 10-15 years, Danger Kids will be available for order on tablets and mobile devices; and hopefully on shelves at your local bookstore. However, we're realistic and know that goals aren't always reached, but whatever you are able to contribute, we'll put to honest use. All funds raised will be put toward to the cost of production and delivering on the perks we outlined here in our campaign. We want all of our contributors to help us, and we don't ever want to break that trust. Our campaign goal will allows us to bring the highest quality product to the market place for our readers and fans. We'll do that with $20 dollars, or we'll do that with $55,000.


The Impact
It is our hope at Danger Kids Universe to bring a new cast of characters to the world that will have a positive effect on society. We know that in today's technologically advance world, entertainment and information comes blazing at us at warp speeds. But our authors were and still are readers. Before television and computers, reading and writing was humanity's primary means of communication, education, and entertainment. We want kids to read. We want adults to read. We want to make sure that reading is still an important part of entertainment throughout the world.
With the release of The Twelve, we have been able to reached almost two hundred new readers in just a few short months. We've visited elementary and high schools and gave away and sold books to excited readers, both young and adult. We've generated a buzz through social media on Facebook and Twitter. Both De'Quan Foster and A.S. Washington make themselves available to fans through their social media accounts. They're accessible and talk about the books, but also about every day things from movies to music.
Your contribution is important to us and will allow us to continue to bring the world Danger Kids. It will helps us be positive role models and contributors to society through books. Our author's dreams are to be the writers of fiction to a new generation of youth, who can grow up with Danger Kids like so many kids grew up with Luke Skywalker, Superman, Batman and Harry Potter. This is our dream. You can help us to achieve it.

I argued that </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">true</i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> innovation -- true disruptive change -- is bred from desperation and necessity. I talked about the people who live underneath Las Vegas, in the storm drains, who pilfer building materials from the world above and build small, shantytown-like communities, surviving in horrifying conditions through sheer ingenuity.</span><br/></p>
<p>And I talked about Africa.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">* * *</p>
<p>I have been drawn to Africa, through myths and music and art, since my childhood. My whole life, I've dreamed of visiting the continent -- of losing myself in the sands of the Sahara or the rain forests of the Gold Coast, of visiting the ancient library of Timbuktu and Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, the place where our species began. You may call it a form of exoticism of the Other if you like, or the echoes of colonialist dreams in the head of a white American dude, but the hold it took upon me was always very real and almost physical. </p>
<p>A decade ago, I began to hear rumors and stories of a technological revolution beginning there, starting with the rise of inexpensive and widely-available mobile phones in the sub-Saharan region. And not only were Africans able to interface and connect with the global communications grid, they were beginning to build out new ideas using these already-outmoded tools. </p>
<p>In my talk, I spoke about Susan Oguya, a co-founder of the Nairobi startup <a href=""http://mfarm.co.ke/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MFarm</a>, who developed an SMS-based tool that allowed Kenyan farmers to verify the going global value of their crops before taking them to market. Susan told me -- when we met at South by Southwest in Austin, in March of 2013 -- about other startups in her city building apps that allowed rural Kenyans to do their banking via SMS, or to give and receive microloans. </p>
<p>These startups weren't burning through billions of dollars of venture capital, and their founders weren't showing up on the cover of <i>Wired</i> or <i>Fast Company</i> or the frontpage of VentureBeat. But their modest efforts, working with technology that most Silicon Valley companies would find as absurd as telegraphy, were changing the way their country's economy worked -- the way that people lived their lives. Not just comfortable middle-class people, but poor people -- who, as we often forget, make up the majority of humanity's ranks. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As Susan said to me when I met her on that warm day in Austin: the base of the pyramid is always the largest part.</span></p>

<p>In the past couple of years, barely a month goes by before you see a headline on some economist magazine like ""<a href=""http://allafrica.com/stories/201308052234.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Africa Rising</a>"". Chinese investors and American tech companies have begun to set their sights on sub-Saharan Africa, like popular high school cheerleaders mercilessly eyeing the new girl in school, trying to decide if they want to make friends. They're gauging whether there's enough money in Africa yet to extend their markets there -- smartphones and Facebook and all the baubles of modern consumer capitalism.</p>
<p>But the impression that I get, from the Africans whom I have spoken to and whose blog posts and articles I've read -- is that nobody there is necessarily <i>interested</i> in Facebook or Uber or any of Silicon Valley's other bright and shining stars. In many cases, their cultural values are simply not the same as ours...but they also want to build their <i>own</i> tech startups, their own economy. If they can do this, they'll pull off a trick that has eluded much of Africa for the past four hundred years: keeping money flowing back into their own economies, instead of pouring into the hands of Westerners who seem determined to keep African nations as helpless client states, often run by corrupt regimes who serve as nothing less than pimps for the minerals and other resources they hold ruthless stewardship over.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h1>The Plan</h1>
<p>I'm raising $10,000 to travel to and around two main hubs in sub-Saharan Africa: Lagos, Nigeria, and Nairobi, Kenya. From these cities I'll branch out to other places as time and finance permit. I'll also be making my way to rural areas outside of the cities, to try to understand how technology could most benefit those who live in villages or the countryside. I'll be spending a month, total, in Africa.</p>
<p>I plan to interview and talk to technologists, startup entrepreneurs, 419 scammers, and everyday people I meet along the way. I'm traveling without guides, drivers, or bodyguards. As I go, I'll take notes and begin writing the book while I'm there, and complete it when I return to Las Vegas. It will be a minimum of 250 pages and include as many photos as I can take that don't suck.</p>
<p>In addition to the standard ebook edition, there will be a limited edition, which will contain more pictures, notes, Tweets, the text of my travel blog, and any video I manage to take, included in a big ol' honking zip file.</p>
<p>If I reach my stretch goal of $25,000, I will take a professional videographer with me, and we'll produce a documentary, which I will make available first to all of my backers.</p>
<p>I'm not an academic or a theorist; I'm a punk rock technologist, and this is not going to be a pop sociology or economy book. As a writer, I'm closer to Hunter Thompson or Lester Bangs than Naomi Klein or Paul Krugman...and this book will be a combination of big thinking about technology, first-person reporting, and gonzo travel writing. It <i>will</i> get weird.</p>
<p>And maybe along the way I can help celebrate the ingenuity and innovation that's happening in Africa now, and help people from my part of the world figure out ways to get involved with people in that part, and help those folks help themselves.</p>

<li>$12,000: I will purchase a DSLR camera for better pictures and video than I can take with my iPhone.</li>
<li>$15,000: I will extend my trip to cover larger geographical areas (including possibly Senegal and South Africa, both of which also have exciting stuff happening, technology wise). This will extend the length of the book as well, obviously.</li>
<li>$25,000: I will take a professional videographer and film a full-fledged documentary, which I will make available to all backers exclusively before it reaches the rest of the world. In addition to the book, of course.</li>

<h1>How You Can Help</h1>
<p>I can't do this without your help. I simply can't afford to fund the trip myself. So I need your money, to be blunt about it. My estimated budget is $10,000, which will cover my airfare, food, lodging, and transportation on the ground for a month, as well as roughly $3000 to help cover my rent and utilities at home and any emergencies that might pop up.</p>

A world of magic and real life stories, written by me, Lady Pol The Beloved, The Beloved Queen.  
Where ? 
In a game played in Facebook, and MySpace as well, played by millions of people all around the world. 

The Kingdom of The Beloved Queen is my concept, an imaginary world, where I do place and write my stories about the battles of knights and monsters, about the heroes,  the passion and the love to the game. About how strangers turn to friends, about how we name ourselves Family. 
How each one of us, having his own real life, becomes a part of my Kingdom, becomes a hero in my books. 
How we love and hate, how we kill our imaginary enemies, how we do learn tolerance, and patience, and what friendship means. How we learn to laugh and smile together, how we do bound our lives as one, and how we meet in our real life.

The Beloved and The Readers



The Kingdom is a concept. 
A place where an ordinary man's story is written and published, and he becomes a hero, showing there are no ordinary people, that we are all unique and one of a kind. 

Heroes exist, it is You, who are my heroes. 
Nobility exists. I see it everyday. 
 And here I am, kneeling in front of all my friends, fans and supporters, honored by them, honored for being a part of such a great community.

The Kingdom and The TreasureThe Kingdom exists in Facebook as a page, run by the author and player, but as being part of a concept, it is to be placed in it's own website, forum and blog. The Queen is writing the first book about the game's battles and it's heroes named ""Daylight Stars"" and is preparing for author's rights registration.    The book is almost finished and it shall be published in three, YES, three languages -  English, Russian and Bulgarian (in negotiations are two more languages to be included in the second edition, French and Spanish). We need Your help for financing the website creation (including the forum, blog and etc.), the interpretation costs, as well as the design and shooting of the book cover. Each one who is involved into the donation's campaign will be awarded with special gifts, some which are hand-made and unique.

My goal is to multiply this effect as many times as possible with Forget Me Not.  

Your Contribution
The funding amount provided will cover:
- a copy editor 
- a proofreader and 
- cover design 
Additional funds will go to promotion,  and the writing contests I plan to have for readers to encourage their own creativity and exploration of topics explored in the book.

Forget Me Not: The Novel
Are you defined by who you were born to or who you choose to become?  Theodora Donovan's overprotective grandmother will not let her do anything, especially, when it comes to an orphan tied to their family's shameful past named Calvin Wynne. Set in the fictional town of Brookhurst, New York, this story will span over a decade, beginning in 1934 and ending after World War II.  Forget Me Not is a coming-of-age tale about the people we can't help but love no matter how strongly others tell us not to.



What This Project Needs 

 This project needs $6000. My co-authors (on other projects) are excited to help out with this one. When I say, we, it refers to Xiomara Ortiz and Erin Okamoto.
$2500 to a professional editor who loves the story (already selected).
$1000 toward design and first 250 print copies to distribute at festivals.
$1000 to a PR professional team to start marketing the book
$500 to fans as prizes and the website.
$1000 to book trailer with professional actors / filmed scene from novel 
Additional funds (if we go over) collected go toward wider distrubution, more print copies, documentary feat. readers and fans, visits to readers (my dream would be to visit the fan in assisted living as well as any other special readers resources allow), and the writer's community inspired by the story.

Note from the Author
I taught high school English for eight years. My students, who came from every walk of life, taught me to go for my dreams.  I would love to show them that life, no matter what comes your way, can still make room for those dreams.  
If you can't make a contribution, I invite you to find my wordpress page under AllisonWhitmore, and get involved with the community.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Culturally, children are exposed to a lot of images of material goods to aspire for, and examples of questionable behavior to idolize. I wanted to create a book that would be attractive to children and provide tools to help them visualize <i>spiritual</i> qualities. As well as one that would make people of any age light up. </p><p><strong>My deepest hope is that children growing up with this book will never have to lose their innate radiance and instead be supported (by the principles and images in this book) in developing those radiant qualities into mature spiritual strength. </strong></p><p> </p><h3>The Baha'i Writings</h3><p>If you are new to this topic, put very simply, the Baha'i Faith is a beautiful, geographically wide-spread and independent world religion that promotes:</p><ul>
<li>the oneness of God (that loving, creative Force we humans call lots of different names in different cultures, languages, and traditions)</li>
<li>the oneness of religion (to be kind, loving and honest is at the heart of every Faith)</li>
<li>the oneness of mankind</li>

Who we truly are
How to live
How to pray
How to treat others
Designed to help children grasp and memorize 39 life-long gems of guidance from the Baha'i writings, and to rekindle child-like luminescence in grown-ups.A great gift for children (of all ages) to empower them to be, and grow into the noble beings they are meant to be!  A Look Inside39 beautiful original illustrations, in a high quality, hardcover book, celebrating the garden of humanity, and reminding us what love in action can look like.All quotes directly from the writings of the Baha'i Faith.  The Mission The inspiration for this project was love. Culturally, children are exposed to a lot of images of material goods to aspire for, and examples of questionable behavior to idolize. I wanted to create a book that would be attractive to children and provide tools to help them visualize spiritual qualities. As well as one that would make people of any age light up. My deepest hope is that children growing up with this book will never have to lose their innate radiance and instead be supported (by the principles and images in this book) in developing those radiant qualities into mature spiritual strength.  The Baha'i WritingsIf you are new to this topic, put very simply, the Baha'i Faith is a beautiful, geographically wide-spread and independent world religion that promotes:
the oneness of God (that loving, creative Force we humans call lots of different names in different cultures, languages, and traditions)
the oneness of religion (to be kind, loving and honest is at the heart of every Faith)
the oneness of mankind
The language of the Baha'i writings is elevated by contemporary standards, but having grown up with them I can attest that it IS possible for youngsters to understand them. It may in fact help develop vocabulary and powers of expression. (It did for me.)I was mindful to select quotes that are spiritually universal: accessible to any believer in a Higher Power, that do not contain faith-specific symbolism or jargon.As well as quotes straightforward enough for a child to understand (with a little explanation). You can learn more about Baha'i in a video I made here, or the one Rainn Wilson made here. If you are a Baha’i, or are a fan of the Faith, there is no question you will LOVE THIS BOOK and want to give it to everyone you know. I created the Baha’i book I always wanted. Where You Come In!Your orders are a spectacular win-win-win!Your BOOK orders (win!) help offset my self-publishing production costs (win + thank you!) and together WE positively impact lives by getting this book into as many hands as possible!

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Redefining Music</i> is a book about how music has evolved and the people who create these changes. In it, I draw connections between a wide range of musicians and genres as they influence each other to create the musical landscape we see today.</p>
<p>My name is Jacob Pellegrino and I am the author of <i>Redefining Music</i>. I wrote this book because I have a passion for music and would like to share my enthusiasm and knowledge with others. I noticed that many people do not realize the importance of the artist as music evolves and wanted to emphasize the role of the creator while helping people to hear new music by featuring artists across a wide range of genres, time periods, and backgrounds.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the distinct role of musical innovators in the evolution of music. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for music. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you to better understand artists who have changed music.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about how music changes over time and the people who drive that evolution. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>When Bruce Pavitt, the founder of Sub Pop Records (the label Nirvana started on), met Kurt Cobain, Kurt didn’t even talk about his band (Nirvana). His biggest claim to fame was being a roadie for the Melvins.</li>
<li>Tony Iommi lost two of his fingertips when he was 17 and had to relearn how to play guitar with his fingers after creating prosthetic fingertips for them. This change deeply influenced Black Sabbath’s sound with lower tunings and a new style of playing.</li>
<li>Kanye West wrote the album 808s &amp; Heartbreak after the death of his mother and his separation from his fiancee. The album addresses West’s heavy emotions and sadness relating to those events and his troubles caused by fame by eschewing rap. Its sound and emotional openness deeply influenced rap as a genre.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you enjoy music, history, attending concerts, and/or play an instrument.<br/> </p>
<p><i>Redefining Music</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to both passionate and casual music listeners who want to look at musical evolution and the interrelation between different genres in a new way.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>editor</strong> I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in April 2021.</li>
<li>The <strong>cover design</strong> of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)</li>
<li>The <strong>layout design</strong> for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</li>
<li>The <strong>copy editing</strong> for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The <strong>launch &amp; promotion efforts</strong> for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.</p>

<h2>About the author and this project!</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Abioseh Cole. I am a nationally recognized poet, teacher, and author, and I am so excited to start this campaign for my children's board book, I Am Not Food! Please help me make this happen!</p>
<p>The book was inspired by a poem that I wrote a few years ago that marked a deeper commitment to the animals for me. It was written from the perspective of animals, declaring, ""I am not food!"" </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560420976/a4zoysj1a450odqqu3bb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I am partnering with Vegan Publishers to put out this book. There is a huge need for children's books that reinforce simple yet fundamental principles for helping parents teach kids about the ethics of animal use. Surprisingly, there are currently no board books for the youngest of children that counter the idea that some animals are here on Earth merely to be consumed by humans. </p>
<p>As a parent myself, I wanted to provide a resource for other parents who need support in raising their kids to understand that nonhuman animals are not here for us; they have their own lives, personalities, and abilities. They are definitely not food, which is a concept that kids can easily understand.</p>
<p>With this book and the poem from which it derived, I also wanted to convey that other animals have the strong will to live just like you and me, hence the powerful refrain, “I am not food!” I wanted to create a book that was powerful and life-affirming, and that was positive in spirit so that it would be appropriate for young children. </p>
<p>I’m thrilled that my book was illustrated by the amazing Kayleigh Castle, illustrator of my favorite children’s book “That’s Not My Mommas’ Milk!” Kayleigh’s style and adorable animal characters were a perfect fit for “I Am Not Food.”</p>

<h2><strong>Where does my money go?</strong></h2>
<p>Our goal is to raise $6,000 to complete this project. Your contribution will go directly to completing, printing, and distributing this book. The reason there aren't more board books with animal rights themes is because they are expensive to produce and are priced low, so it is difficult for smaller publishers to afford to publish them. For your contribution, you will receive a gift from us ranging from a post card to a personalized illustration of you and your child. You will also receive our deepest thanks and appreciation for making the book happen! Without your support, this book won't make it into the hands of parents who can use it.</p>
<h2><strong>Campaign perks</strong></h2>
<p>We have a variety of perks that you can purchase in order to support this campaign. You can purchase a signed copy of the book, an eBook, tee shirts, or a limited addition illustration print from the book. Also, you can receive an original personalized print of you and your child created by the illustrator, Kayleigh Castle!</p>

<h2>Other ways you can help!</h2>
<p>Financial contributions are a key part to making this book a reality, but getting our message out to as many people as possible is also vital. Sharing, posting, and talking about this campaign with your family, friends, and anyone you know will help this project reach its goal and get more support for our message. </p>
<h2>When will I get my book?</h2>
<p>Books will be delivered within two months after the campaign ends!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Deteriorate is a novel set in a post-climate change world. It follows three friends, Theo, Nick, and Jordan, over the course of a backpacking trip and their experiences in the harsh world that they find themselves in.<br/><br/>My name is Malcolm Brune, and I am the author of Deteriorate. I wrote this book because I am unsettled with the way the world has treated our climate, and I want all of us to step up.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a little bit about what the Earth could look like in 30 years. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to face the reality of what our daily lives could look like and learn the importance of our relationships with others in a less-than-comfortable world.<br/><br/>BLURB:<br/>In 2050, the oceans have risen. Coastal cities are all but empty. The globe is warm, very warm. The meat and agricultural industries have collapsed. Theo, Nick, and Jordan set off on a journey they had embarked on once before, many years prior. With each step, they must face the harsh environment that the world has evolved into.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy spending time outdoors, have a passion for the environment, or like to think about the future.<br/><br/>Deteriorate speaks to teens and adults who want to face climate change and friendships in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Deteriorate inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p>What can I do for the Earth?</p>
<p>How can I keep my relationships safe heading into the future?</p>
<p>How much longer can we deny climate change?</p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing climate change and our role in caring for our home, as well as relationships, will change us all for the better.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Pretty Young</i> details the various kinds of mental noise &amp; distractions that young women face as they grow up and enter adulthood, and specifically entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>My name is Sarah Whitney Humphrey, and I am the author of <i>Pretty Young</i>. I wrote this book because, as a 23-year-old woman, I personally understand the mental and emotional struggles that all young women face as we grow up in a culture and society that can oftentimes produce a lack of confidence, worthiness, and assuredness in ourselves. I want to bring these issues to light and change the narrative!<br/><br/>I hope that by reading my book, you will begin to recognize and understand your own limitations and mental noise present within your own self. These limitations and mental noise &amp; distractions often unconsciously affect every aspect of our life, so I aim to highlight various issues that young women often face, yet so often neglect to address. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for mental wellbeing, gender equality, and entrepreneurship. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you discover your own limitations and mental distractions so you can begin to show up in this world like you were designed to — confident, worthy, and assured!<br/><br/>In <i>Pretty Young</i>, you'll learn about the cultural, societal, and religious pressures placed on women from a young age, mental health and illness, the sexualization of women, the gender disparity gap in entrepreneurship, and other similar topics that women often neglect to talk about. </p>
<p>You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Social media’s mental and emotional affect on young women’s wellbeing and how the media has contributed to an increase in body-image related issues</li>
<li>How to recognize signs of a toxic relationship along with practical tips and scientific-based research on how to overcome these toxic patterns</li>
<li>Understanding your need for validation and learning to self-validate through a series of psychological-based practices</li>
<li>Uncovering the underbelly of the #MeToo movement, gender-based violence against women, and my personal experiences </li>
<li>How women can begin to close the gender gap in entrepreneurship &amp; business so they can be the CEO their parents always wanted them to marry!</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are a college-aged or post-graduate woman looking to better herself, you want to learn more about women’s right issues, or you want to support me! :)<br/><br/><i>Pretty Young</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to young women interested in mental and emotional wellbeing and anyone who is looking to help amplify more women’s stories who want to look at mental wellbeing and women’s life experiences in a new way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Pretty Young</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts:<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>contains the introduction + chapter 1. This section explains the overall premise of the book, as well as how women are treated and viewed in society today.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 2 through 14. This section details various experiences that women go through on a daily basis, including stories regarding mental wellbeing, social media &amp; its affects on women, familial and cultural pressures, gender-based violence against women, confidence, misogyny, and more! Every chapter in this section includes personal stories, as well as several different accounts from friends, colleagues, social media influencers, professors, and entrepreneurs.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 15 through 17. This final section details how all of these prior experiences affect women as they enter entrepreneurship and business. From the pay gap to sexism in the workplace, I detail the stories of female entrepreneurs, such as Sara Blakely, Allee Williams, Sydney Williams, and more.<br/> </p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Sarah Whitney is a 23-year-old woman who is passionate about all things mental, emotional, physical, &amp; spiritual wellbeing related. Sarah is your typical fun-loving, active, and extroverted young woman; but it’s her drive, discipline, &amp; desire to make a difference that set her apart from the rest! It’s her greatest aspiration to live a life that matters and hopes to promote the importance of engaging, vulnerable conversations. While they are sometimes not the easiest to have, they are essential for overall personal development! <br/><br/>Having graduated from the University of San Diego in the midst of a pandemic, Sarah, like many of her peers, was at a loss when it came to figuring out her life path. Yet, as someone who dreams big, Sarah decided that there was never a better time than to follow her dream of writing a book!<br/><br/>Sarah wrote <i>Pretty Young</i> because she wanted to highlight the very real and sometimes very hard experiences women face on a daily basis. Whether these issues are mental, emotional, physical, spiritual, or a varied combination of the four, Sarah knew that she was not alone in experiencing hardships and hopes to show young women that they are never alone.<br/><br/>In her free time, you can find Sarah taking lots of long walks on the beach, enjoying some form of exercise, or hanging out with friends. Once the pandemic is over and it’s safe to travel abroad, Sarah is excited to hit the town, and Barcelona will be her first stop!<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Sarah at itaintitsispodcast@gmail.com and at @sarahwhitneyhumphrey or @itaintitsispodcast.</p>

You will love this book if you are a college-aged or post-graduate woman looking to better herself, you want to learn more about women’s right issues, or you want to support me! :)Pretty Young is a nonfiction book that speaks to young women interested in mental and emotional wellbeing and anyone who is looking to help amplify more women’s stories who want to look at mental wellbeing and women’s life experiences in a new way.

Pretty Young
The book is written in 3 parts:Part 1 contains the introduction + chapter 1. This section explains the overall premise of the book, as well as how women are treated and viewed in society today.Part 2 contains chapters 2 through 14. This section details various experiences that women go through on a daily basis, including stories regarding mental wellbeing, social media & its affects on women, familial and cultural pressures, gender-based violence against women, confidence, misogyny, and more! Every chapter in this section includes personal stories, as well as several different accounts from friends, colleagues, social media influencers, professors, and entrepreneurs.Part 3 contains chapters 15 through 17. This final section details how all of these prior experiences affect women as they enter entrepreneurship and business. From the pay gap to sexism in the workplace, I detail the stories of female entrepreneurs, such as Sara Blakely, Allee Williams, Sydney Williams, and more.

<p><u>There’s Only ‘I’ in Team</u> is a multidimensional exploration of business dilemmas and the interactivity between our <i>individual genius</i> (our 'I') and that of others.</p>
<p>A healthy interactivity with others is necessary for our best problem solving, and is the only true path to innovation. We need each other, but we also get in each other's ways; this book provides a way forward to deal with - and even benefit from - this paradox.</p>
<p>This book is research-backed, insightful, candid, and funny. By the end, you’ll have a completely different way of thinking about professional relationships; you may even come away with greater insight on the ‘secret sauce’ of meaningful personal relationships too!</p>
<p><strong>Why I Needed to Write This Book</strong></p>
<p>My approach is different from other approaches because it respects and celebrates who we are as individuals – our individual genius – and gives us a roadmap for empowering this genius that will elevate others and is the key to innovation.<br/><br/>My name is Dr. Annemarie Spadafore and I am the author of <u>There’s Only 'I' in Team</u>. I wrote this book because, while there are hundreds of thousands of leadership books, none of them quite capture the full picture of what is actually going on in my client’s business relationships. Other books are two dimensional, whereas my book provides a multidimensional way of thinking about the common yet intractable business dilemmas they face.<br/><br/>I’m always looking to develop myself, and this constant quest for insight has led to me discovering an incredibly valuable approach that has been proven to strengthen relationships and lead to better results in dealing with dilemmas. But to my surprise, not much has been written about this approach outside of academic journals.<br/><br/>My clients deserve better. There is a real gap in the literature on how to truly be effective in business relationships, and I had to do something about it. I decided to write this book to bridge this gap and provide clients - and you! - with this truly valuable information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Why You Need to Read This Book</b><br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that there is so much more potential in yourself and your work relationships than what you've previously explored. There are many more opportunities for us to solve problems, be innovative, and to get things done than we might be aware of, if only we had the necessary perspective!</p>
<p>In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for thinking differently about our dilemmas, so that we can be our best and help others be their best as well. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your ‘individual genius’ in the most effective way</li>
<li>Avoid becoming entangled in exhausting and distracting conflicts</li>
<li>Utilize a different way of thinking about leadership dilemmas and challenges</li>
<li>Expertly lead yourself and others through change</li>
<li>Wield your power most effectively to solve problems and drive innovation</li>
</ul>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about relationship systems and how they impact our performance and our results. You’ll learn about how we can make the most of these systems to bring out the  genius in all of us, while driving creative and innovative responses to large-scale challenges and obstacles.<br/><br/>You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>A story straight from the U.S. military on what it really takes to build trust with others</li>
<li>Examples of executives who are courageous enough to lead differently and who are getting incredible results</li>
<li>Stories that further illuminate groundbreaking research on the brain and our responses to others</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you are prepared for the amazing empowerment that comes from really inhabiting your strengths and owning who you are. You’ll also love it if you might be a little disenchanted with the insincerity of other approaches in influencing, motivating, and collaborating with others, and if you are hungry to learn what actually works!</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are sometimes puzzled by the behavior of people in business environments, or any professional environment or workplace, this book is for you</li>
<li>If you sometimes feel that other people don’t really understand or appreciate your strengths, this book is for you</li>
<li>If you are less-than-stoked by some of the behavior of your family members or friends, this book is for you</li>
<li>If you just like learning new things, including having ‘aha’ moments, particularly in regard to the fascinating study of human behavior, this book is for you</li>
<li>If you are just generally annoyed by others at times, this book is (especially) for you!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><u>There’s Only ‘I’ in Team</u> is a nonfiction book that speaks both to business executives and any person who is courageous enough to upgrade their thinking about relationships, and who wants to look at collaboration and fully utilizing their talents, strengths, and gifts in a new way.</p>
<p>There’s never been a better time for this book. We have all faced a massive amount of upheaval and change, and this is an amazing opportunity to rethink how we operate in our relationships, how we can bring more of ourselves to our interactions, and how this will ultimately help us deal creatively and confidently with the unknowns we face.</p>

<p><strong>About the Author</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Annemarie Spadafore is Founder and Managing Partner of PowerLab; her ability to combine research from the most well-respected institutions with her own insightful, mind-expanding perspectives has enabled her to provide captivating public talks and highly valued executive coaching services to C-Suite and senior executives in the world’s most demanding, high-stakes, and exacting professions.</p>
<p>She wrote this book because she could never find the absolute perfect book to recommend to her clients that would help them gain perspective on their business, professional, and relationship dilemmas. She's spent her entire career thinking about business dilemmas, particularly the dilemma of making the most out of human potential in the workplace, and the dilemma of developing innovative responses to our greatest challenges; it was such a wonderful discovery for her to find an approach that can actually help us be our best selves in the face of these dilemmas. And that is why she is so excited to share more of this information with you!</p>
<p>When she's not exhausting her eyeballs with research, or having a blast going on amazing journeys of discovery with clients, she likes to spend the balance of her time perfecting her backstroke at the pool, resisting the soulful entreaties of her two black Labradors, Juno and Benjamin Bear, and continuing to learn more (through repeated exposure) about the individual genius of her wise and creative husband, Steve. She indulges her creative side further by singing (she has a smoky Soprano II voice that works well in several genres) and attending as many concerts as her bank account and schedule affords.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Dr. Annemarie Spadafore at annemarie@powerlabpartners.com and</p>

</div></div>","Chi è Rick DuFer? Rick DuFer è l'unico e vero filosofo di YouTube. Se non lo conosci c'è qualcosa che non va. 

Che cos'è FiloSoFarSoGood?
Si tratta della più bella rubrica di YouTube, in cui si raccontano le idee filosofiche che stanno dietro la nostra cultura POP: serie TV, film, fumetti, musica! Che filosofi stanno dietro Breaking Bad? Non lo sai? Per questo hai bisogno di FiloSoFarSoGood!    Perché questa campagna Indiegogo? Questa campagna serve a diffondere il messaggio che: ""La filosofia va presa di petto""! E quale miglior modo che girare per le strade del tuo paese e della tua città con questi filosofi sul petto? Foucault, Kant, Bergson, Spinoza, Nietzsche, Darwin, Leibniz, Freud, nella splendida illustrazione dell'artista Marzio Mariani! Devi avere un caos dentro di te per indossare una maglietta così. 
Verranno stampate 100 magliette per mostrare ai tuoi amici che la filosofia è una cosa per gente fica. 

Perché dovresti contribuire alla campagna?
Il motivo è semplice: sostenere e diffondere la mia attività divulgativa. Se lo farai, come ringraziamento riceverai la T-Shirt FiloSoFarSoGood con la straordinaria illustrazione dell'artista Marzio Mariani! Ho pensato di suddividere in questo modo la campagna, sulla base di quello che ti sentirai di donare: 

Donando 5 euro sosterrai la campagna e verrai citato in un video di FiloSoFarSoGood, ma se in futuro volessi ordinare la maglietta, le spese di spedizione saranno a mio carico; 

Donando 10 euro, la maglietta di FiloSoFarSoGood sarà tua, dovrai soltanto pagare le spese di spedizione oppure incontrarmi per averla; 
Donando 15 euro, ti spedirò la maglietta di FiloSoFarSoGood direttamente a casa! Ti basterà comunicarmi l'indirizzo; 
Donando 30 euro, ti spedirò a casa la maglietta di FiloSoFarSoGood e UNA COPIA DEDICATA del mio romanzo ""I pianeti impossibili""! Questa opzione è dedicata solo a chi la filosofia la prende davvero di petto! :D 
Nulla vi vieta di donare di più, ogni centesimo sarà usato per migliorare e ampliare le attività di divulgazione del mio canale! 

  Operazione Trasparenza
La campagna ha un traguardo fissato di 600 euro ed è mirata a sostenere l'attività del canale. Questo significa che, nel caso il traguardo non venisse raggiunto, le somme versate saranno restituite per intero. Ogni centesimo eccedente i 600 euro verrà reinvestito per migliorare l'attività divulgativa del canale! I costi da affrontare per raggiungere questo traguardo sono i seguenti: 

stampa di 100 magliette: circa 410 euro, IVA inclusa 
spese per il logo: 150 euro 
commissioni PayPal e altre spese: 40 euro circa 
   Se non puoi contribuire
Non ti devi preoccupare, un modo c'è sempre: condividi sui tuoi social questa campagna, invita le persone a conoscere la mia attività divulgativa, dai il tuo aiuto nel far conoscere FiloSoFarSoGood e le altre rubriche del mio canale invitandole a iscriversi e sostenere il mio progetto!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Why do these things always end with me shoeless and screaming?</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The
 Squirrel!Terror stories were among the most popular on my blog. I 
started writing them during a pretty dark time in my life, and before I 
knew it, I was breathlessly involved with Neo, Romeo, Juliet, and all 
the other critters of the Kingdom of Backyard. The posts were lost when 
my site was hacked, but I've managed to rebuild them with the help of a 
few fans.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because my fabulous Readers kept asking if I'd put them in a book. And I like making my Readers happy.</p>
<p>The
 initial goal for this campaign will defray the (already-incurred) costs
 of paying an editor, buying stock art for the cover, and conversion 
into ebook and paper file formats, as well as the (yet to be incurred) 
costs of getting ebook and paper copies into distribution and sending 
out rewards (there are some great ones, and postage is a killer 
nowadays). Anything over the amount of this campaign will go to the 
costs of future ebooks--like Selene, or the Adventures of 
Napoleon!Squirrel. (Or maybe even Fred and George; there's no shortage of stuff I could release this way.)<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Since I've already paid the aforementioned editor and for the costs of formatting/conversion, everything is pretty much done. I'm doing this mostly for costs already incurred, to defray what I've already sunk into the project. I don't foresee any setbacks--if this doesn't fund, it'll just take me longer to get Squirrel!Terror out.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>UPDATE:</b> Wow. Just...wow. We're fully funded! We do have some perks left, if you want them, and any contributions from that will go toward other projects like <i>Selene</i>, etc., or extending SquirrelTerror's reach.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you all. I'm absolutely blown away by this.<br/></p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><font size=""5"">The Back Story</font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">For more than 15 years, researcher and author Tony Wright has been piecing together academic findings from numerous disciplines, ranging from neuroscience, endocrinology, nutrition, anthropology, primatology, pharmacology and developmental biology to botany, palaeontology, zoology and behavioural sciences. With the help of writer Graham Gynn, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Left in the Dark</span> is the result of his work, in which the chemistry of our brain and nervous system is scrutinised, and its evolution traced all the way back to the ancestral tropical forest. <br/><br/>The authors point to a symbiotic relationship between our forebears and the forestâ€™s flowering plants, whose fruit gave us a uniquely hormone-rich nutritional environment in which to evolve. In their opinion, this had particularly significant implications for our endocrine system â€“ the system by which hormones govern many of our bodyâ€™s functions and the development of our brain.<br/><br/>This complex biochemistry was lost to us when the last of our human ancestors were separated from the forest environment roughly 200,000 years ago. According to Wright and Gynn, we thereby lost our optimum â€œdesign conditionsâ€, resulting in a net loss of critically important abilities â€“ notably for harmonious coexistence with each other and our planet. <br/><br/>Although we appear to have successfully survived, the authors argue that, rather than being at the pinnacle of our abilities (technological know-how and industrial-scale utilisation of resources notwithstanding), we are in fact a shadow of what we could be.<br/><br/>Specifically, the authors show that our right brain hemisphere has retained particular strengths which are both generally untapped, and likely to be precisely what is needed at this time when natural resources (from fuel to land and food) are stretched, with the ensuing potential for conflict and hardship. Basing their work on careful analysis of original scientific papers, with simplicity and elegance, they demonstrate how our left hemisphere, which dominates our current thinking and planning, is â€œin the darkâ€, subjectively unaware that it is has lost much of its own unique capacity.<br/><br/>A fascinating picture thus emerges, reminiscent of the â€œgolden ageâ€ common to many mythologies: of a latent human capacity for co-operative, peaceful behaviour which could be intrinsically linked with greatly enhanced abilities of understanding, perception and creative thinking. Unlocking these in all of us is a tantalising prospectâ€¦<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Interested? We are! </span><br/><br/>In fact, the unlocking of this potential is something we would like to see being prioritised. The implication is that we may be neurologically compromised, affecting both how we perceive ourselves/each other and the world we live in â€“ in other words, our very consciousness. If we are in effect suffering from a delusional mind, then repairing this damage could radically change the way we think and the decisions we make.<br/><br/>The prospects we face as a species and the impact on our paradisiacal home often seem very grim: re-establishing our own neural integrity could provide the very thinking we need to find adequate solutions â€“ solutions that would benefit the whole planet, not just a minority; solutions based on empathy and compassion instead of fear and control.<br/><br/>In other words, in order to repair the outer damage, we think it may be critical to repair the inner neural damage.

We need your help to push this message out to a wider audience NOW.

Thank you for your support!

P.S. Are you wondering about the Kickstarter project we ran last year?

This IndieGoGo project has the same basic objectives as 'Molecules
      of Madness', which is to create a much more accessible translation of the theory
      outlined in Left in the Dark and deliver it to a mainstream audience.
      With the promise of mainstream media support, last year we      launched an ambitious project to finance a major film collaboration with
      award-winning documentary filmmaker David Malone. The Kickstarter project went live, but unfortunately, and perhaps not surprisingly,
      the mainstream media went AWOL.Interest in our work continues to develop, but without finding a route into
      mainstream awareness, it may well take many years to gain real traction (which our world cannot afford). We launched this IndieGoGo campaign to fund the books, allowing us to capture mainstream attention at a fraction of the cost of a documentary.

The partners of WNV (Wasp Nest Videos) and I are planning on releasing an EBook That will be dedicated to the people who suffer through homelessness here in California. California has the highest number of homeless families and individuals of all the US states and in a privileged Country like America, the numbers are unacceptable! According to the last assessment by the Housing and Urban development organization over 130,000 people are homeless in California at any given time; over 20,000 of which are children or youths completely on their own! <br/></p>
<p>Our idea is to put a book out there that will not only tell the stories of people who have been in this terrible situation but the stories of those who do their very best to help the masses of homeless that need and deserve all our help. We will also be doing a year long web series on our YouTube channel to keep the problem, cause, and EBook in the public eye. All the net profit from the book will go to helping homeless shelters and groups who are already helping homeless!<br/>
</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>        In order to make this book and series good enough to attract buyers and of course readers; we need to raise money for better equipment and the copyright for the EBook itself as well as for travel to interview as many organizations and individuals as possible to ask them of their experiences and their tips for how everyone can help out personally. The equipment in question is:<br/></p>
<p>An imac for faster editing to do the shoots and videos in a timely manner</p>
<p>A Panasonic GH4 which will be the main camera used for the photo shoots as well as any filming in the near future</p>
<p>3 Panasonic lenses to give variety to the shoots and depth to the book; the lenses are a 14 mm prime lens, a 14 mm to 42 mm zoom lens, and a  45 to 200 mm zoom lens</p>
<p>A Rode video shotgun mic with stand and 25 ft cable for better sound quality in videos and interviews</p>
<p>A 3 point soft lighting kit for studio lighting <br/></p>
<p>The total of the items listed above is more than 4000 dollars combined but with that minimum Wasp Nest Videos can cover the rest and expenses for interviews so we can start immediately. <br/></p>
<p>          For your help of helping us reach our goals; we have listed out an extensive list of perks including a raffle for 2 free event photo shoots for anything you may need, discounts on photo shoots for any occasions, and free promotion for businesses who donate and recognition in the EBook for groups and individuals as well who donate extra generously to the project.

The Impact
By
contributing to our campaign, you’ll be making
the three years of artistic and administrative effort
we’ve invested in the Dirty Laundry series worthwhile. 
You’ll
be helping two emerging artists see the first major display
of their collaboration shared with a global audience, in a custom-designed digital setting.
As well as the financial help needed to cover final
production costs, you’re giving us a vote of confidence that will fuel us onto the
next step in our artistic careers.

Most
of all, you’ll be helping us
make a damn fine piece of art, and one that keeps on
giving; once we have built the architecture of On
The Same Page we will be able to continue to use it
as the basis for future projects. And so can you: by donating £300 / $490 or above, you'll receive a licensed copy of our
software files and PDF guide so that you can
publish your own content with our template.Sneaky previewHere's a mock-up to help explain how the app will look/work, featuring some of the images from Dirty Laundry.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p> <p> </p>
<h3>Book's Impact on Society's Heart</h3>
<p><i>""Naked Soul: The Erotic Love Poems"" </i>is a beautiful collection of all kinds of human emotions dealing with the theme of love, romance, seduction, chase, erotica, nudity and human fantasies. The poems here cover spiritual love to possessiveness, from hurt to ecstatic joy, from dark passion to sweet seduction, from first love sensations to devastating pain of loss, from conservative and familiar love making to repressed human fantasies. The words here are not just poetic but sublime, touching the heart, gently massaging it with visual imagery, metaphor and emotionally explicit, innocent intimate expressions.</p>
<p>We need more such books today and therefore more support from the masses who still believe in passion, love and the art of storytelling. By making this project come to fruition, trust me, for a night or two, all of us will dance to the muse of our inner longing. I can't wait to hear from all of you who wants to buy this book now.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Teaser Poem for You to Enjoy</h3>
<p>If you would like more, please comment and I will put two more here for you to enjoy as you wait for the complete book with over 150 such pieces of fine art that you can relate to. In the book, ideally speaking, I would love to add some pictures &amp; sketches as well. Please, feel free to provide feedback, ask questions, make suggestions or start a conversation in the comment section.</p>

We have a beautiful product here, wonderfully written with professional presentation, and we want more and more people to hear about it. We need a book marketer to get ""Naked Soul: The Erotic Love Poems"" into the bookstores, amazon, et al.

So where does the money go? Where will we spend? In approximation:

Release Dates and Fundraising Goals



If we generate our target goal of $25K, we will be publishing the book's first printed edition in October 2014. I am planning to publish it on my birthday on October 8th. If we fall short of the budget, we will be releasing the book right before Valentine's day, Feb 2015. However, I am really hopeful that we can make this book happen by this October. And with your help, yes, we surely can.


If you claim your book as eBook or printed copy, it will be mailed to your address before the official release. That's great news, isn't it.

If you are going to contribute to us now (but do not buy the book), you would be able to buy it on both amazon.com and lulu.com later. All good news.

Ways You Can Help

Please pick a perk that best suits your interest and budget. We have both the soft copy of the book and as well as ebook. And then we also have other steamy perks. Take a look.
Please contribute as much as you can. It's not just a book but an expression of human longing. Please support as your heart guides you.
Please remember to use the Indiegogo share tools to share this project with others on facebook, twitter, instagram, google+,  linkedin, youtube, emails, texts and word of mouth. You can share multiple times.


Finally, I just want to thank you again for your help!",1.0,3,"1 Campaign

Look Inside

The overall pattern of what's going on with humanity right now.  VERY CLEARLY. The map of humanity's move from the mind to the heart, so your mind can see, relax and trust  -  you can see and know what's going on. It's very simple once you see it. 
What is behind all the intensification right now. Humanity's one obstacle and how we each move beyond it. 
 I teach you how to work with your heart to dissolve out old gunk and open to more love and power. 
Stories of the beautiful world we are coming into, and  stories of the magic of your higher nature: which is what opens thru your heart in the new energies, as you become more and more YOU. (Unicorn means ""awakened one"" by the way, all you unicorns.)



Why I Wrote This Book



After experiencing “success” and then near-death burnout in the hyperdrive of Silicon Valley tech culture, I was told I might die if I didn’t take a break. My life was a wreck, so I started looking at what was really going on in the big picture. 
I worked with outliers – from deep physics to energy healers, co-working Hubs and tech organizations, wall street to indigenous wisdom teachers. I learned from the various edges…about the middle…where everything connects to everything. 
I began to see that I was not alone - a lot was changing. 
I began speaking to people and I found that what I had learned was hugely valuable to others. More and more people came to me.
There were more people than I could speak to and so I wrote this book.
I believe this books hits the moment of now and can bring clarity, help inspire, empower, and en-joy (create more enjoyment for) so many. 

The way I see is rare.


More of my story. 




What I Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  I'm asking for at least $3450 in pre-orders, support and help, and perks to move me thru this final period. I have been working on this for a long time, and I've committed everything.  I have some very fun and clear heart-power-empowering and videos that will go along with the book's themes. Also, I always come up with more stuff along the way, so even if you contribute $1,  you'll know what's moving along! I always come up with new stuff along the way.  If I don't reach my funding  goal, everyone who supports this book at the book level will receive it no matter what.



The Impact

There are just a lot of people wondering what the heck is going on right now on the planet. 
I have very important knowledge for this time. 
Many people know something is up, but their mind can't articulate what's going on yet. 
My book shares the clear and simple map of these times: the end of power, the decline of violence, the rise of love, what's behind the intensification right now and what's BEYOND it and how we get there. 
So your mind can relax and trust where our hearts are going. And you can experience more safety, happiness and peace. 
And if you're in your mind, I teach you how to move to your heart. This is a major issue as some are trapped in their minds and do not know how to walk from Mind to Heart and are not feeling the new love energies on the planet.

My book opens up more love and peace and joy - and truly helps people know what's going on, how to navigate in and benefit from these times - things are incredibly different right now. 
My book teaches people to see the overall pattern on the planet right now so your mind can relax and trust your heart as you work with it, 
My book contributes to an exponential healing and empowerment wave on the planet.






Risks & Challenges

Challenge: This is the most valuable thing I have to offer the world now. So, it's important, intimate and takes courage. My heart is out there. And my massive knowledge base. 
Challenges: I'm so desiring being completely supported as I walk this home! There are more images and design support I'd like that I don't presently have funds for. 
And to know people are looking forward to experiencing my work, and to have the support to easily and fret-free complete this because I know my baseline is all-covered would be a huge gift.
This book is happening no matter what. I'd love to be fully met this last bit home.

<p><strong>I've always wanted to write my own kind of fairy tale, one where the main protagonist was feisty, determined, and relatable.

<li>
<p> I'm back from a long vacation to my home country of Peru where I visited Kutu's own ""hometown"": Cusco. I had an splendid time there, learning more about history and just breathing in all the magic of that beautiful city.</p>
<p>Kutu's first Indiegogo campaign is closed now. It didn't go as well as I had expected, but I'm not going to let that discourage me from meeting my goals with this book. A combination of personal turmoil and bad timing got the best of me this year. As a result, I will have to take a change of course and see less expensive ways to publish this book. Don't worry, though. This doesn't mean my commitment with my backers is going to be impacted. I'll still fulfill your orders and hopefully, meet your expectations.</p>
<p>When I posted an update on Facebook last week, a person criticized our choice of style for the character of Kutu. ""Why do you have to present her as being short and chubby?"" Furthermore, she said, ""She should be normal. We need to break the bad stereotypes..."" </p>
<p>So my answer to her was NOT ALL PRINCESSES HAVE TO BE LEAN AND TALL! And since when being short and/or chubby is considered subnormal? </p>
<p>This commentator, in my opinion, suffers from reverse prejudice. According to her thinking, we need to ""normalize"" everyone by making our differences invisible.</p>
<p>The way I see it, Kutu represents those who aren't lean or tall but are equally strong and brave. She learns to be comfortable in her own skin and discovers her inner strength. Isn't that a message we all want passed onto our sons and daughters?</p>

Kutu's first Indiegogo campaign is closed now. It didn't go as well as I had expected, but I'm not going to let that discourage me from meeting my goals with this book. A combination of personal turmoil and bad timing got the best of me this year. As a result, I will have to take a change of course and see less expensive ways to publish this book. Don't worry, though. This doesn't mean my commitment with my backers is going to be impacted. I'll still fulfill your orders and hopefully, meet your expectations.
When I posted an update on Facebook last week, a person criticized our choice of style for the character of Kutu. ""Why do you have to present her as being short and chubby?"" Furthermore, she said, ""She should be normal. We need to break the bad stereotypes..."" 
So my answer to her was NOT ALL PRINCESSES HAVE TO BE LEAN AND TALL! And since when being short and/or chubby is considered subnormal? 
This commentator, in my opinion, suffers from reverse prejudice. According to her thinking, we need to ""normalize"" everyone by making our differences invisible.
The way I see it, Kutu represents those who aren't lean or tall but are equally strong and brave. She learns to be comfortable in her own skin and discovers her inner strength. Isn't that a message we all want passed onto our sons and daughters?

<p>My name is Alouy Martinez, I'm a current student at Sul Ross State University where I'm majoring in Creative Writing with a minor in Art. I've  published two short stories with the University's Literary Magazine known as the Sage, <i>""Red Lights</i>""(2013) and a poem <i>""Scarlet</i> ""(2014). I've also self-published the series that I'm here to talk to you about. I'm an artist, and I recently won an award for a self-portrait at an Art competition within the University. (3rd place) </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/807608/files/20140823200812-alouy.jpg?1408849692"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The purpose of raising this money is to re-lunch a series that I can't let go. I strongly believe The Shadows Saga has potential, and will teach valuable lessons that today are mostly masked by too much romance and graphic scenes of today's books, and while The Shadows Saga does contain this elements. It mostly focuses on family and friendship, and the struggles of human/immortal nature. The series at the moment is consider Young Adult (YA), yet, with this re-launch the series will turn into New Adult (NA) meaning it will have more mature scenes that were omitted before. <br/></p>
<p>I know I'm asking for a lot, but I'm re-lunching a series; meaning not just one book, but two short stories and the second book in the series. Your help will help me achieve something that I was too naive to understand the magnitude of marketing a book. For me, it was and still is all about the story, but in reality to continue writing and expose my stories to the public, money has to be invest with: editing, great cover, content, marketing distribution, and clarity. With your help I can achieve these and more. <br/></p>
<p><b>Summery of prequel short story White Raven (Book 0.5)<br/></b></p>
<p>White Raven is a very short story set within the world of The Shadows 
Saga, following Ophelia an Akita soldier who is sworn to protect the 
Shadows. The story takes place moments before the Shadows return in the 
first book The Shadows: The Return Has Begun.<br/></p>
<p><b>Summery of The Shadows: The Return Has Begun (Book 1)<br/></b></p>
<p>Destiny is about to change. What lurks in the shadows may change the 
destiny of six young lives forever. That is, if they can survive at all.
 The Shadows: The Return Has Begun, the heart-pounding young adult debut
 novel by Alouy Martinez, is a tale of mystery, suspense, action, and 
romance that charts the perilous course of six young characters as their
 fates unfold, and their true identities are revealed as the formidable 
entities known as The Shadows. Dramatic, dark, and alluring, this 
enthralling work of fiction goes where no vampire or werewolf novel has 
ever gone before. The Shadows: The Return Has Begun shares the points of
 view of the six young characters as they journey together to Paris, 
France. They are Ashlenn Vandenhoff, Melinda Wadsworth, Darcy Roswell, 
Christopher De Groot, Kaden Worthington, and Justin Fraser. In Paris, 
each must grapple with his or her own inner demons. However, it soon 
becomes chillingly evident that someone is in bloodthirsty pursuit of 
them all. They soon thereafter realize their destiny as The Shadows, 
beings created over two thousand years ago to restore order to the 
unbroken rules of The Heavenly Laws. Upon their demise in 486 AD, a 
prophecy was born as they took their lives into their own hands. That 
prophecy marked their return. However this time, destiny won’t control 
them.  At the onset of the novel, Ashlenn is having visions of her 
parents’ death, but she chooses to ignore them. As the novel shifts 
perspective from one character to the next, plots diverge, then 
intertwine again. Similarly, each of the characters in The Shadows 
brings into light his or her most hidden moments, only to face a destiny
 that may be even more terrifying yet. Will they overcome forces that 
are primed to wage deadly battle against them all? And can they face 
their own demons as they do? The Shadows: The Return Has Begun creates a
 new legion of deadly foes that rages through every gripping page of 
this wildly inventive, gripping new novel.</p>
<p><b>Summery of short novella Whisper to me Softly (Book 1.5)</b></p>
<p>There’s only two things that Nathalie Thorn cares about, surviving and 
fulfilling her promise. When her father was murdered, Nathalie made a 
promise to never return to sea, until she finds her father’s killer. 
Little did she know that her promise would become her curse. 
<br/>FROM THE WORLD OF THE SHADOWS SAGA
<br/>Learn the story behind Nathalie Thorn, and unravel the truth behind her Immortality.

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>First of all most of the money will go into buying and shipping all the goodies you that you are getting. With that said, everything will be shipped once I either reach me goal, or come in contact with the money.</p>
<p>Second, as mention before, the current books and the 2nd book in the series will get rounds of editing, proofreading and copy editing, which believe it or not, its the most expensive process of self-publishing. With my first publication, I payed over $5,000 dollars and $3,000 of that money (rounding number here) went into editing itself, and while it was great editing, it still needed it another round, and I didn't had the money to do that. I went forward with the publication, because I was not going to waste my money by keeping the book just for me. There are not many mistakes, but I've come across reviews that mention the mistakes, and for a writer we want the best quality of our story. Also, I keep coming across that the book seems to throw people off due to the amount of details and world building, with editing and proofreading it will help clarify the story better. Also wink, wink adding the scenes that will make the series from Young Adult to New Adult. <br/></p>
<p>Third, the series is actually illustrated by me. Each chapter contains a drawing at the beginning of an important scene within the chapter, thus, foreshadowing a little bit what the chapter will be about. Again, I was rushing things too fast when I drew them, because this was actually a last minute idea that I added when publishing the series, and I kinda got stuck with the style of the drawings. Therefore, with the re-launch I will re-due these drawings, but in the style of digital art. Yet, I need the tools to create this new art, and with your help I will be buying an Wacom Cintiq 13HD in order achieve the new quality of the illustrations, plus re-due the covers of each book with illustrations that will represent the books better, and appeal to readers more. (Side Note: The Cintiq 13HD will also come with great perks for my college studies and future works)<br/></p>
<p>Fourth, as said before, exposure is important when it comes to the publishing world. With your help, I will be setting off marketing tools such as paying to get a reviews with <i>Publishers Weekly </i>or other outlets of exposure: such as Facebook, Goodreads Advertisements,  book bloggers for reviews, and blog tours. I wish I could go on a book tour, but that will cost a lot more, and that's something that with the success of this re-lunch can hopefully be achieve in the future. </p>
<p>Now let's get to the fun part, the goodies you will get for helping the Shadows return once more. <br/></p>
<p><b>IMPORTANT NOTE:<i> ONCE THE CAMPAIGN IS OVER, I WILL BE CONTACTING ALL THE CONTRIBUTORS FOR SHIPPING ADDRESSES, E-MAILS, SHIRT SIZES IF THEY APPLY.

I know I'm asking for a lot, but I'm re-lunching a series; meaning not just one book, but two short stories and the second book in the series. Your help will help me achieve something that I was too naive to understand the magnitude of marketing a book. For me, it was and still is all about the story, but in reality to continue writing and expose my stories to the public, money has to be invest with: editing, great cover, content, marketing distribution, and clarity. With your help I can achieve these and more. 
Summery of prequel short story White Raven (Book 0.5)
White Raven is a very short story set within the world of The Shadows 
Saga, following Ophelia an Akita soldier who is sworn to protect the 
Shadows. The story takes place moments before the Shadows return in the 
first book The Shadows: The Return Has Begun.
Summery of The Shadows: The Return Has Begun (Book 1)
Destiny is about to change. What lurks in the shadows may change the 
destiny of six young lives forever. That is, if they can survive at all.
 The Shadows: The Return Has Begun, the heart-pounding young adult debut
 novel by Alouy Martinez, is a tale of mystery, suspense, action, and 
romance that charts the perilous course of six young characters as their
 fates unfold, and their true identities are revealed as the formidable 
entities known as The Shadows. Dramatic, dark, and alluring, this 
enthralling work of fiction goes where no vampire or werewolf novel has 
ever gone before. The Shadows: The Return Has Begun shares the points of
 view of the six young characters as they journey together to Paris, 
France. They are Ashlenn Vandenhoff, Melinda Wadsworth, Darcy Roswell, 
Christopher De Groot, Kaden Worthington, and Justin Fraser. In Paris, 
each must grapple with his or her own inner demons. However, it soon 
becomes chillingly evident that someone is in bloodthirsty pursuit of 
them all. They soon thereafter realize their destiny as The Shadows, 
beings created over two thousand years ago to restore order to the 
unbroken rules of The Heavenly Laws. Upon their demise in 486 AD, a 
prophecy was born as they took their lives into their own hands. That 
prophecy marked their return. However this time, destiny won’t control 
them.  At the onset of the novel, Ashlenn is having visions of her 
parents’ death, but she chooses to ignore them. As the novel shifts 
perspective from one character to the next, plots diverge, then 
intertwine again. Similarly, each of the characters in The Shadows 
brings into light his or her most hidden moments, only to face a destiny
 that may be even more terrifying yet. Will they overcome forces that 
are primed to wage deadly battle against them all? And can they face 
their own demons as they do? The Shadows: The Return Has Begun creates a
 new legion of deadly foes that rages through every gripping page of 
this wildly inventive, gripping new novel.
Summery of short novella Whisper to me Softly (Book 1.5)
There’s only two things that Nathalie Thorn cares about, surviving and 
fulfilling her promise. When her father was murdered, Nathalie made a 
promise to never return to sea, until she finds her father’s killer. 
Little did she know that her promise would become her curse. 
FROM THE WORLD OF THE SHADOWS SAGA
Learn the story behind Nathalie Thorn, and unravel the truth behind her Immortality.

  What We Need & What You Get
First of all most of the money will go into buying and shipping all the goodies you that you are getting. With that said, everything will be shipped once I either reach me goal, or come in contact with the money.
Second, as mention before, the current books and the 2nd book in the series will get rounds of editing, proofreading and copy editing, which believe it or not, its the most expensive process of self-publishing. With my first publication, I payed over $5,000 dollars and $3,000 of that money (rounding number here) went into editing itself, and while it was great editing, it still needed it another round, and I didn't had the money to do that. I went forward with the publication, because I was not going to waste my money by keeping the book just for me. There are not many mistakes, but I've come across reviews that mention the mistakes, and for a writer we want the best quality of our story. Also, I keep coming across that the book seems to throw people off due to the amount of details and world building, with editing and proofreading it will help clarify the story better. Also wink, wink adding the scenes that will make the series from Young Adult to New Adult. 
Third, the series is actually illustrated by me. Each chapter contains a drawing at the beginning of an important scene within the chapter, thus, foreshadowing a little bit what the chapter will be about. Again, I was rushing things too fast when I drew them, because this was actually a last minute idea that I added when publishing the series, and I kinda got stuck with the style of the drawings. Therefore, with the re-launch I will re-due these drawings, but in the style of digital art. Yet, I need the tools to create this new art, and with your help I will be buying an Wacom Cintiq 13HD in order achieve the new quality of the illustrations, plus re-due the covers of each book with illustrations that will represent the books better, and appeal to readers more. (Side Note: The Cintiq 13HD will also come with great perks for my college studies and future works)
Fourth, as said before, exposure is important when it comes to the publishing world. With your help, I will be setting off marketing tools such as paying to get a reviews with Publishers Weekly or other outlets of exposure: such as Facebook, Goodreads Advertisements,  book bloggers for reviews, and blog tours. I wish I could go on a book tour, but that will cost a lot more, and that's something that with the success of this re-lunch can hopefully be achieve in the future.

<p>This campaign I'm asking you to join is much larger than myself. I've largely bowed behind my work. What your contribution means, in this case, is freedom for me to accept all of these offers across this country, to talk about in public what I have only been considering in my own small world until now.</p>
<p>What you offer sends me out in to this.</p>
<p>This is what my financial goal accomplishes:</p>
<p>Hotel rooms, gas, food, airfare and promotional materials such as posters and flyers not provided by the venues. I'll likely need more business cards printed as well. And books I have to send these bookstores on consignment so that they might make a profit on having me there to read. This usually means crates of them I must pay for ahead of time. Per venue for this tour, the book cost alone will be around 200.00-250.00, for a total of at least 1000.00 as of right now.</p>
<p>What you give makes me as a national author more concrete, because I'll have the chance to meet people in person rather than online. The human connection your donation affords me is priceless. </p>

I had written a few chapters when my Dad, who helped me whenever I asked and is my number one supporter, asked, ""How about you try to publish this?"" And here I am :) This is the longest project I've ever worked on and I'm beyond happy to see this finally coming to a close, 65,000+ words later. Where the money is going to go...Eventually I plan to do my own illustrations, but as of this moment I lack the ability. That's why I need the money for three more illustrations from my talented artist, the cover art, as well as the first printing of books and a small website. If I don't reach my goal amount, I will just have to not do the additional illustrations, perhaps skip the website, and maybe skimp on some of the other things.  But I really think the additional illustrations would make the book better and, of course, the website would help everyone spread the word!  So please consider helping me launch this project the right way! Thanks so much!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>is an online development where anyone can write and publish their own books.  We have made it easy for you to copyright and publish your books online.  For those that still want to use publishers because they are the best at what they do in assisting writers and artists, this is the place for them as well.  We want this to be a place for everything in publication.  Where you can search for everything including Novels, Cook Books, Children Books, Comic Books, Magazines, Newspapers, and even those fun things called Coloring-Books.  The greatest thing is that they will be able to be read on all Computers, Tablets, and Smart Phones that have internet access to download them.  Sellers will also be able to offer PDF printing formats and Printed versions in Paperback and Hardback.  With that being said, we welcome you to the future of publishing.</p>
<h1>How does it work?</h1>
<p><strong>Sellers</strong>  choose the book price, choose additional formats such as PDF, Paperback or Hardback, provide details about the book, including the option to allow readers to read the First Page of the book or the First Chapter, and finally they upload their work, which we then convert into our digital platform</p>
<p><strong>Readers</strong> search the site for their interests, read the info about the book, and then buy it.  They can then read it online from their account or download it to view anytime offline. If PDF is an option, they can print it.  Paperbacks and Hardbacks are mailed to them.</p>
<p>We have also created an <strong>Assistant</strong> Program. This is a win, win situation for everyone.  Freelancers and Companies increase profits while being able to assist Sellers with editing, artwork, IBN numbers, or to Copyright their work.  </p>
<h1>So, why Indiegogo?</h1>
<p>The project has got to the stage of full force, nose to the grindstone, development.  With the launch in July, I need to bring on a few more bodies to fill the seats beside us to get it moving.  Then there are the servers.  The servers have to be able to power this beast into the fast lane.  A slow server is not something that can be tolerated with such a large system. </p>
<p>The money raised will help with the final stages of getting the site online and ready for users by the mid to end of July.  We will continue with the site and product development even if the funds are not raised, but at snail mail speed instead of internet speed. </p>
<p>If we raise beyond our goal, we will certainly adjust our rewards for everyone.  It will also allow us to upgrade to product development  and hardware that we planned to do after the site has come fully operational with income from selling books. Which is part of our growth strategy.   We want to accelerate our growth by bootstrapping, which is another term for developing and improving the product with internal cash.  It is the best way for growth with determination that failure is not an option.  Think of it as your first car.  You get the car, next you remove the bald tires - they worked, but were still bald, then you painted it and put in new carpet. That is what we plan to do with our development, continually change it for the better of publishing. </p>
<h1>What do you get out of this?</h1>
<p>Besides a bunch of words on paper, I mean text online at indiegogo and the satisfaction of helping create the much needed future platform for publishing.  You will get some Totally Awesome Swag, books, and advertising from us.</p>

is an online development where anyone can write and publish their own books.  We have made it easy for you to copyright and publish your books online.  For those that still want to use publishers because they are the best at what they do in assisting writers and artists, this is the place for them as well.  We want this to be a place for everything in publication.  Where you can search for everything including Novels, Cook Books, Children Books, Comic Books, Magazines, Newspapers, and even those fun things called Coloring-Books.  The greatest thing is that they will be able to be read on all Computers, Tablets, and Smart Phones that have internet access to download them.  Sellers will also be able to offer PDF printing formats and Printed versions in Paperback and Hardback.  With that being said, we welcome you to the future of publishing.
How does it work?
Sellers  choose the book price, choose additional formats such as PDF, Paperback or Hardback, provide details about the book, including the option to allow readers to read the First Page of the book or the First Chapter, and finally they upload their work, which we then convert into our digital platform
Readers search the site for their interests, read the info about the book, and then buy it.  They can then read it online from their account or download it to view anytime offline. If PDF is an option, they can print it.  Paperbacks and Hardbacks are mailed to them.
We have also created an Assistant Program. This is a win, win situation for everyone.  Freelancers and Companies increase profits while being able to assist Sellers with editing, artwork, IBN numbers, or to Copyright their work.  
So, why Indiegogo?
The project has got to the stage of full force, nose to the grindstone, development.  With the launch in July, I need to bring on a few more bodies to fill the seats beside us to get it moving.  Then there are the servers.  The servers have to be able to power this beast into the fast lane.  A slow server is not something that can be tolerated with such a large system. 
The money raised will help with the final stages of getting the site online and ready for users by the mid to end of July.  We will continue with the site and product development even if the funds are not raised, but at snail mail speed instead of internet speed. 
If we raise beyond our goal, we will certainly adjust our rewards for everyone.  It will also allow us to upgrade to product development  and hardware that we planned to do after the site has come fully operational with income from selling books. Which is part of our growth strategy.   We want to accelerate our growth by bootstrapping, which is another term for developing and improving the product with internal cash.  It is the best way for growth with determination that failure is not an option.  Think of it as your first car.  You get the car, next you remove the bald tires - they worked, but were still bald, then you painted it and put in new carpet. That is what we plan to do with our development, continually change it for the better of publishing. 
What do you get out of this?
Besides a bunch of words on paper, I mean text online at indiegogo and the satisfaction of helping create the much needed future platform for publishing.  You will get some Totally Awesome Swag, books, and advertising from us.
The Good Stuff!

<h3>A historical book about Dreamcast games, with a unique approach - in this book I tell the story from right inside the games themselves.</h3>
<p>Travelling through the maps and screens of three Dreamcast games, follow the network of players, developers and events that contributed to the Dreamcast phenomenon. It's a spatial history of videogames, focusing on a time when 3D, open-world virtual play spaces first became possible.<br/><br/>When you remember video games of the past, what comes to mind? Is it the incredible processing power of the machine on which you played? Is it the hard work of coders and artists whose names you never learned? No, I bet the first thing that you think of when you remember your favourite games is exploring the game yourself. Pushing your character through the terrain, progressing further into new areas, finding hidden secrets... This book tells a history of those game spaces.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Why you'll love this book</h3>
</div>
<div>I am developing a new approach to video game history that begins within the games themselves, examining the game worlds themselves and reaching outwards into the wider network of production and consumption. It's an inside-out history, and it provides new insights into how games can be interpreted, and what games can mean in their broader context.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This project will expand my 30,000-word MA thesis written at the Royal College of Art on the RPG <em>Skies of Arcadia, </em>into a book covering three different Dreamcast games. You can read extracts from it <a href=""http://zoyastreet.com/extracts-from-the-thesis/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>Examiners' praise of the thesis:</strong></div>
<div>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>""This thesis takes studies of this subject in a new and highly original direction, bringing to it a comparatively broader, holistic perspective... Zoya writes with exceptional clarity about difficult topics and often finds unusually felicitous phrases to articulate her ideas.""</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>""Her discussions of the way in which space is constructed, of game design as a form of spatiality, and of the human interactions within this virtual space are especially illuminating.""</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>""This is undoubtedly an original piece of work, which probes the current thematic limits of Design History.""</em></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>I want to bring this approach out of academia and into the real world, to test its mettle and stir a bigger conversation with developers, fans and people like you.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My thesis came in three parts. First, a thorough documentary history of how <em>Skies of Arcadia </em>and other games for Dreamcast as well as RPGs for other platforms were being developed and discussed. The second chapter examined theoretical perspectives from a range of disciplines on how we can read game space, and how these readings apply to <em>Skies of Arcadia</em>. The third chapter looks at cultural themes in the game from the point of view of cultural exchange in a global information network. In the end, the entire thesis comes full circle, finding that the technological and economic changes happening on a wider scale as described in chapter one were reflected in the spatial designs analysed in chapters two and three.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>From what I learned when writing my thesis, I came away with the urge to be more bold, and really ground the story in the game worlds. This project will rework those existing three chapters and add two more, expanding the story to incorporate two more Dreamcast games - probably Shenmue and Phantasy Star Online, but I'm open to suggestions. I want to work hard on making this book stimulating but accessible, and by incorporating more games I hope to give an inside look into space design and virtual world architecture at this pivotal moment in video game history.</div>
<div>
<h3>What I need and what you get</h3>
I really want to get this book made, but I need funds to allow me to spend time working on this  instead of taking on more Japanese-English translation work to keep myself afloat. That's part of the reason why I've reached out to the book's audience directly, offering pre-orders and favours in exchange for a sort of writer's advance. If I hit the $5000 target, that will give me just under $3000 after fees, tax and the projected cost of printing the pre-ordered books once I'm finished - enough to let me work part-time on the book for 2-3 months (this figure is a very rough estimate and depends on which reward-level people choose to buy into).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In return for your donation, you'll get a digital, paperback or hardback copy (or copies) of the book once it's ready. The higher reward levels come with extra special perks, such as a named acknowledgement in the book, and a blog post about how wonderful you are (and by that I mean you, personally - I'll do my research). If you feel inspired to donate particularly generously, I will write a detailed report on spatial design in a game you have made, applying innovative interpretive and historical techniques to your own work.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Should I happen to surpass my target, a few things could happen:</div>
<div>1) The book will be better! More polished content and more exclusive interviews with developers.</div>
<div>2) If I get enough extra funds to cover the cost of writing my next book, you'll all get free pre-order copies of that book too.</div>
<div>3) I'll start 'kicking forward', to use a phrase from another website. I'll put excess funds from this project into indiegogo projects by enterprising young researchers, as well as donating to existing funds to help students in financial need and raise aspirations in underprivileged areas.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I want to develop this book in direct conversation with readers - I'll be sharing ideas and snippets with you along the way, and hosting regular debates on Google+ about the issues that come out of my research. No good work can be made without criticism, and you will be the first to hear what I'm working on and voice your opinion about it. I need your feedback as much as I need financial support.</p>
<p>If you're psyched about this project but you're not able to donate funds, then you can still follow my blog (zoyastreet.com) and stay involved in the conversation, albeit at a bit of a delay. I still need your discerning eyes, and I hope you'll be willing to lend them to me.</p>

She enjoys helping other writers learn to find their voice and develop a professional style that matches their writing personality while continuing to grow her writing abilities. <br/><br/>As a human with empathy, Francine has often wondered what will happen if people don’t learn to overcome their differences and work together. What happens when people effectively put aside their differences and use their diverse ideas, skills and abilities for a greater purpose. This novel is an entertaining, non-preaching, look at those who work against others for their own gain and those who come together despite their differences, shortcomings and disabilities to selflessly improve the life of others. <br/><br/>Francine has gone through many ideological and physical changes in her life. One thing she has always believed in is that people can change. Regardless of age, infirmity, or circumstance we all have the opportunity to become better people. All it takes is faith, patience and perseverance. Something she likes to use as a theme in her writing. <br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Francine at weagle.francine@yandex.comand @weagle.francine on Instagram and Francine Weagle, Writer on Facebook.</p><p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p><p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes.

She enjoys helping other writers learn to find their voice and develop a professional style that matches their writing personality while continuing to grow her writing abilities. As a human with empathy, Francine has often wondered what will happen if people don’t learn to overcome their differences and work together. What happens when people effectively put aside their differences and use their diverse ideas, skills and abilities for a greater purpose. This novel is an entertaining, non-preaching, look at those who work against others for their own gain and those who come together despite their differences, shortcomings and disabilities to selflessly improve the life of others. Francine has gone through many ideological and physical changes in her life. One thing she has always believed in is that people can change. Regardless of age, infirmity, or circumstance we all have the opportunity to become better people. All it takes is faith, patience and perseverance. Something she likes to use as a theme in her writing. For more information you can connect with Francine at weagle.francine@yandex.comand @weagle.francine on Instagram and Francine Weagle, Writer on Facebook.Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #SecondCivilWar and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so we can help amplify your efforts.You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the pagePlease share my book to 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it. Please do this as a text message or Direct Message on social media.Thank you so much of all of your love and support!Thanks again,Francine Lee W.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign
