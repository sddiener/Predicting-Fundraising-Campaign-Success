<p>Most of us aren’t able to name at least three ingredients in the products we use on our bodies and in our homes. We decided to craft aromatherapy products with natural, recognizable ingredients and without the use of chemicals. We’ve also seen many products labeled as “aromatherapy” but are actually scented with synthetic fragrance oils. We only use pure botanical aromatherapeutic essential oils in our products and we keep our ingredients to a minimum.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626365104/lhanhojxxkgdpwtvfjpu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>And while we are more environmentally conscious than ever before, we still have a long way to go in how much waste we accumulate. Our products are specifically formulated to be multi-use which eliminates the need for additional single-use goods. For example, our linen mist also functions as a body spray and a room refresher and our 100% pure carrier oils can be used as an unscented body oil or massage oil.</p>

<p>Also, most of our products are bottled in Opaque Biophotonic Violet Glass which extends the life of its contents plus they are aesthetically pleasing and 100% recyclable and reusable. Our carriers are bottled in PET bottles which are also both reusable and recyclable.</p>

<p>Bombay &amp; Cedar is family owned and operated in Atlanta, GA. We created this brand because we wanted to craft aromatherapy products without the use of artificial ingredients, chemicals and other unnecessary fillers. With this in mind, we decided to focus on natural and pure ingredients for our products. Launched in July of 2017 as a wellness lifestyle subscription box featuring two of our pure essential oils every month. Bombay &amp; Cedar believes in purity and the power of safe, natural ingredients. All of our products are vegan &amp; cruelty-free plus they are free of chemicals, parabens, SLS or other artificial ingredients.</p>

<li>This set of products can be used not only in the office, but also as a good home decoration. </li>
<li>Some of them can be used in two different ways (vertical or horizontal). With their formal clarity, they are always recognizable as belonging to each other. </li>
<li>Our prices are very reasonable, and the quality of our products is absolutely worthy of their prices.</li>

The paper-folding desktop set uses all metal.</p><p> </p></div>","What is a ""paper-folding desktop set""? The desk set consists of 8 products that correspond formally and functional with each other. The design concept was inspired by the traditional origami paper folding art and transferred into a modern production process by using sheet metal. Starting from the concept of structural principles and geometric figures. We refer to the Eastern Origami craft and the aesthetic language of Western cubism, in consideration to enhance the overall visual perception of the design through the combination of layering and geometric depth.
 
 
Why do I choose your paper-folding desktop set? 
Our products use all metal materials, which are not only practical but also stylish and beautiful. The practical and stable material is both environmentally friendly and recyclable. With the aim of using as few parts as possible for each product, most of them consist of only one piece of iron sheet. 
This set of products can be used not only in the office, but also as a good home decoration. 
Some of them can be used in two different ways (vertical or horizontal). With their formal clarity, they are always recognizable as belonging to each other. 
Our prices are very reasonable, and the quality of our products is absolutely worthy of their prices.
 
Where can I use a ""paper-folding desktop set""? This office desktop set is both multi-functional and decorative, not only satisfying the daily office needs, but also adding a stylish atmosphere to the home space with an elegant and emotional design.We have achieved a balance between function and form by taking advantage of the similarities between the material characteristics of sheet metal and paper. The softness of paper and the hardness of sheet metal are stylistically blended, both the line and surface make an harmonious fineness.From the perspective of design style, our triangular deconstructed half-encircling design highlights its structural layering and rational aesthetics with its neat construction, clear lines and delicate presentation.  But I already have other desktop set , is it necessary to change to yours?Our ""paper-folding desktop set"" has advanced design with a better price. It can be used forever after one purchase! Excellent design will bring a completely different visual experience. The ""paper-folding desktop set"" uses all metal materials, so the life cycle of these products will be very long. The prices of similar products on the market are very high and many of them are not all metal but just metal mesh.    We have a lot of project experience to ensure you get the perfect product！A pilot production round was part of our design process.

Our breathable clever-comfort design means your robe will be comfortable to move in and won't ever feel too hot on your skin.   Our cotton of choice is ethically grown, picked, and manufactured in the Nile Delta then shipped straight to you. Egyptian cotton has longer, stronger fibers. Making the end product more enduring and softer than anything you've felt before.  This means no harmful chemicals or substances will ever be used in the production of your robe.  No more synthetic fibers on your precious skin   No more fabric that snags and unravels   No more sleeves that are too short/long    Say hello to deep, functional pockets    Hugs the body, quickly wicks moisture and stays cool in hot weather.  
  Side effects may include: never wanting to put clothes on again.           Your outfit for when you’re not ready to get seriously dressed yet + shields your children from having to see you walk around in your underwear. It's been described as having something called “classic nomadic charm”.   There's no one more important to us than our backers. That's why we decided that once you buy our robes, you should never think about buying another robe again.No arbitrary time limit, no ridiculous demands. If something goes wrong (like you burn your robe over the stovetop) we’ll send you a new one for a small fee*, if you send us your old robe back. *based on location and size of the order.     Get Your Project Funded Today!",33.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>While the taste and quality of pet food are continually improved upon each year, drinking water for pets is not considered or valued as pet food. Alvinoo smart pets water fountain is here to help you and your pet.</p>
<ul style=""margin-left:240px;"">
<li>No induced current</li>
<li>Constant temperature</li>
<li>Dynamic water</li>
<li>Antibiosis</li>

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why is water quality important for your pets?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Induced Current</strong></p>
<p>Most electric pet water fountains on the market have induced current problems. Induced current can stimulate pets and lead to serious physical and mental illness including fear of drinking and Hematuria (blood in the urine). It is an unspoken problem within the pet industry, but Alvinoo decided to solve it! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596438507/ve15vvqnly1d3idffawl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Water Temperature</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scientific research shows that the body temperature of dogs and cats is 100.4 °F/38° C. Drinking warm water at a constant temperature, is healthier, and gentler, for pets’ gastrointestinal system. It could also prevent some related diseases, especially for cats as they are known to have a very sensitive gastrointestinal system.</li>
<li>71.6 °F/22°C is the best water temperature for the gastrointestinal system of both cats and dogs.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590633760/vmlot2qneytptrh5ou03.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Dynamic Water</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pets love dynamic water, which is more oxygen-rich and fresher than stale water. That’s why they like licking running water.</li>
<li>Our experiments show that cats drink dynamic water from the Alvinoo water fountain, 3 times more than stale water from a normal water bowl.</li>
<li>Organic matters in stale water causes anaerobic microbial to grow and reduces the oxygen in the water. This would pollute the water and could cause health issues for your pet.</li>
<li>Dynamic water could increase the oxygen in the water and promote decomposition of any organic matter keeping the water fresh, and your pet healthy.</li>
<li>Drinking more water, and cleaner and fresher water, could prevent your pet from urinary tract and kidney diseases.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Life-threatening Bacteria</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scientists have discovered pets' water bowls can harbour life-threatening bacteria, including E. coli, salmonella, and MRSA.</li>
<li>Scientists also found that water bowls used over long periods have far greater quantity and species of bacteria present.</li>
<li>The evidence also shows pet water bowls can pose a risk of infection to humans, as well as to petss.</li>

</div></div>","Introduction
While the taste and quality of pet food are continually improved upon each year, drinking water for pets is not considered or valued as pet food. Alvinoo smart pets water fountain is here to help you and your pet.

No induced current
Constant temperature
Dynamic water
Antibiosis
Water filtration

 


 
 
Why is water quality important for your pets?
 
Induced Current
Most electric pet water fountains on the market have induced current problems. Induced current can stimulate pets and lead to serious physical and mental illness including fear of drinking and Hematuria (blood in the urine). It is an unspoken problem within the pet industry, but Alvinoo decided to solve it! 
 

 
 
Water Temperature

Scientific research shows that the body temperature of dogs and cats is 100.4 °F/38° C. Drinking warm water at a constant temperature, is healthier, and gentler, for pets’ gastrointestinal system. It could also prevent some related diseases, especially for cats as they are known to have a very sensitive gastrointestinal system.
71.6 °F/22°C is the best water temperature for the gastrointestinal system of both cats and dogs.


 
Dynamic Water

Pets love dynamic water, which is more oxygen-rich and fresher than stale water. That’s why they like licking running water.
Our experiments show that cats drink dynamic water from the Alvinoo water fountain, 3 times more than stale water from a normal water bowl.
Organic matters in stale water causes anaerobic microbial to grow and reduces the oxygen in the water. This would pollute the water and could cause health issues for your pet.
Dynamic water could increase the oxygen in the water and promote decomposition of any organic matter keeping the water fresh, and your pet healthy.
Drinking more water, and cleaner and fresher water, could prevent your pet from urinary tract and kidney diseases.

 


 
Life-threatening Bacteria

Scientists have discovered pets' water bowls can harbour life-threatening bacteria, including E. coli, salmonella, and MRSA.
Scientists also found that water bowls used over long periods have far greater quantity and species of bacteria present.
The evidence also shows pet water bowls can pose a risk of infection to humans, as well as to petss.

 

 
 
What Alvinoo Water Fountain Can do
 
Constant Temperature

Antibiosis

The drinking water tray is made of antibiosis UV materials.
4 antibiosis filtration layers : 

 

High-density microporous filter: to filter out hair & debris.
Ion exchange resin: Removes heavy metal ions such as calcium and magnesium, softens water quality.
Honeycomb activated carbon: filters microparticles such as sand, rust, etc.
Primary effect cotton filter: filtering dust particulate from the air.

<p>We're proud to be protecting nearly 5 million homes from clogged drains, costly plumber visits and--most importantly--toxic liquid chemicals. Now we're back with our next crowdfunding campaign to bring you the most advanced drain protection solution ever created: The all-new ShowerShroom® Ultra. Tell your plumber to lose your number. The revolution in drain protection is here.</p>
<p><strong>A Revolution in Drain Protection</strong></p>
<p>Our story began in late 2015 with the launch of our original award-winning TubShroom® Drain Protector right here on Indigogo. The market and user response was phenomenal, to say the least. We knew we had to keep innovating in the drain protection space in order to help our customers protect every drain in their home, simply and effectively. So we came out with SinkShroom for bathroom sinks, and Kitchen SinkShroom for kitchen sinks, and DrainShroom to clear virtually any drain. Now, by popular demand, we'd like to introduce you to our all-new ShowerShroom Ultra. Let's begin...</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587143491/pd4sjdksettlfvfctgst.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The patent-pending ShowerShroom® Ultra borrows from much of the same technology found in our original TubShroom®. To provide superior protection to every drain in the home, we knew we had to tackle the shower next. Ask yourself the following questions: How many strainers have I gone through in the past couple of years? How easy is it to clean my current strainer? Is my current strainer an eyesore? Does the water continue to back up every time I take a shower? How much do I dislike putting my hands on disgusting clumps of wet hair? We addressed all these concerns.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s6.gifyu.com/images/gif1d5140916135c0696.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587143716/ohmhftdasaht05erzndd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We started with the best materials out there to prevent rusting and to preserve durability. Our stainless steel strainer is made to last the test of time and it looks fabulous in any bathroom. The days of ugly and single-use strainers are gone. We've tested compatibility with a vast number of bathroom shower stall and shower tub drains out there and the fit was terrific virtually every time out. The concept is simple, but the execution is elegant.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587143737/cl0qf1bdssajm3iqkf1y.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have filled the strainer with loads of human and pet hair to test just how much it could handle and the results were impressive. We know many of you out there have long hair or have family members with long hair, so the amount of times your drains clog on a yearly basis can get unbearable. No matter how full the strainer portion was, the water continued to flow through the metal and silicone cylindrical holes and the drain remained clog-free after months of use. Mission accomplished.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587143758/moh3hw7ghjuoxhcdyqj3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Did we mention how easy it is to clean the ShowerShroom Ultra? Simply grab the center soft ""Mushroom"" part out of the main strainer body, then wipe off any accumulated hair with a paper towel--no mess, no fuss. Many strainers make it unnecessarily difficult to pull the hair off and the unsightly wet hair is often on display the entire time. Our calling card is ease of use. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s6.gifyu.com/images/gif2ae5ceaded706ca8b.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Just look at that beautiful piece of craftsmanship of our unit and then visualize the dinky &amp; bland plastic colored strainers we often find littered on store shelves. The soft brushed lines and jet black center cylinder and trim really make our unit pop and matches virtually any shower stall or shower tub aesthetic. Form and function in one package.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587143846/vmctl86nmggodqn4z9zx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Just keep flowing, just keep flow...ing. Water gets through--hair doesn't. When clumps of hair and gunk gather in your drain, the result is slowed or clogged drains. It's time to take back your bathroom. We've engineered the ShowerShroom® Ultra to sit perfectly flat in your stand-up shower stall drain or bathtub drain, covering one edge to the other uniformly so that water faces no resistance in making its way down the drain, while all the hair gets snagged on the black strainer, out of sight. Showers and tubs have an indiscernible taper towards the drain opening so that gravity pulls water and hair where they need to go. Don't let your strainer be a hindrance to science.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587143863/qp4tg1yeyr0bvtiikqxp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Our research shows that the vast majority of clogs occur in shower tub and shower stall drains. Virtually every home in the world has a shower or bathtub because that's where people give their kids and pets baths and where they take their showers. The number one cause of clogged drains is long hair. The longer the hair and the more people or pets in the home, the higher the likelihood of clogs. Given all this, we knew we had to optimize our ShowerShroom Ultra for both shower and bathtub drains. From the precise sizing of the cylinder to the placement of each and every hole, we put literally years of testing into this upgrade.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587143898/kt6ianel7xwe12xwpnud.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>And it's nearly here! The latest evolution of our award-winning TubShroom® family of drain protectors is the ShowerShroom Ultra. We can't begin to tell you how many random 'Shroom owners have emailed us, visited us at trade shows, or just talked to us in person about how much they love their TubShroom and SinkShroom products. We want to take this moment to thank each and every one of you who have trusted us with your drains by bringing a 'Shroom product home with you.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s6.gifyu.com/images/gif3db26e7934887666b.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We went back to the drawing board and figured out ways to further improve water flow. No one wants to stand in ankle-high soapy water while showering. We have not only achieved our best flow rate testing to date, we have also ensured that even abnormally shorter or wider drains get great drainage results with the ShowerShroom Ultra. As always, hair is caught out of sight and clean-up is a breeze. Now, with ShowerShroom Ultra, you can go longer (sometimes months instead of weeks) between cleanings. When the center cylinder is full of hair, just grab a paper towel or tissue paper and swipe that bundle of hair right off into the trash. </p>

<p>We'd like to take a moment to apologize in advance for showing all that wet hair in pictures, but there's no better way than showing exactly how well our patented TubShroom Chrome technology works than with an image. In short, there's a bottom flange that sits inside your tub drain where all the hair is neatly caught out of sight while the water continues to flow--as it should--through the dozens of strategically placed holes throughout the perfectly-sized cylinder and mushroom head.</p>

<p>What TubShroom does for tub drains, the SinkShroom Chrome does for bathroom sink drains. Hair, jewelry, and other objects can't get past the SinkShroom. Dual ""arms"" help hold the unit in place so the water can continue to flow without interruption. Our original SinkShroom design raised over $100k on crowdfunding campaigns and thousands still use it to this day. </p>

<p>The patent-pending Kitchen SinkShroom® borrows from much of the same technology found in our original TubShroom®. To provide superior protection to every drain in the home, we knew we had to tackle the kitchen sink next. We started with the best materials out there to prevent rusting and to preserve durability. Our stainless steel is made to last the test of time and it looks fabulous in any kitchen. The days of ugly strainers are gone. We've tested compatibility with a vast number of kitchen sink drains out there and the fit was perfect every single time. No more rising dirty dish water.</p>

<p>And last, but not least, we have the DrainShroom Universal Drain Snake that works with virtually any drain in your home. Coming in at a lengthy 42"", the DrainShroom gets to where it needs to and snags those nasty balls of hair with ease. The DrainShroom attaches to any power drill (note: power drill not included) to create an easy-to-use and highly effective rotating mini snake. The best part is that you can use it over and over again, but once you clear your drain and place a ShowerShroom Ultra (or other 'Shroom product in place) you shouldn't ever need to use your DrainShroom again. You could always pay it forward to a friend since you'll be living the clog-free life. </p>

<p>In late 2015, Juka Innovations Corporation was started in Glen Cove, NY by Serge Karnegie and Solyman Najimi--two long-time friends. Serge and his wife, Elena, were fed up with their ever-clogging bathtub drains. You see, the couple had two young daughters and multiple pets in their original apartment, so it was no surprise that their drains clogged so often. Serge perfected his original TubShroom design and, along with the help of Solyman, the duo brought it to the masses via a Indigogo campaign, which turned out to be the launchpad the fledgling company needed to go on to become the leader in drain protection that it is today. </p>
<p><strong>Dear backers,</strong></p>
<p>Some of you have been with us since our very first project launched in 2015, and some of you will join the ""Shroom"" family for the first time. Regardless, we are very thankful for your support and trust in the quality of our products. Thanks to our early adapters, our original TubShroom was born, eventually becoming the #1 best-seller on Amazon and at many major big box retail stores. We're proud to say that since the launch in 2015, we have helped to protect close to 5 million drains worldwide.</p>
<p>We must say that there were a few bumps on the road. Inventory shortages, shipping delays, intellectual property battles, and more. We have had to learn the ins and outs of plumbing, drainage, and design. Furthermore, we have visited many countries around the world to compare and analyze drain types. Our goal is to protect every drain in your home and with the launch of this Indigogo campaign, we feel we have gotten that much closer. Our team's focus is on producing innovative products that save people money, solve real-world problems, and that look great.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking this journey with us. We promise to do our utmost to continue to provide amazing products and terrific support. Please reach out to us at support@tubshroom.com with any questions you have on our previous products or for any topic you have not seen covered in this campaign.</p>

<p><strong>Will I get my Order (ie Award) in the Summer?</strong></p>
<p>We are working around the clock to achieve a ship date of late June to July 2020. Unforeseen challenges may arise to prevent that, but we have been on the clock many times before and we were able to deliver on time. International orders outside of the USA will take longer to arrive due to the extra transit times, but, as always, we'll keep all of our backers in the loop throughout the process.</p>
<p><strong>What drain types are supported by these products?</strong></p>
<p>ShowerShroom Ultra works with stand-up shower stall drains and shower tub drains. About the bundle options: The Kitchen SinkShroom works in virtually all kitchen sink drains, which are typically about 3.25"" wide. TubShroom Chrome works in virtually all bathtub drains (typical tub drain sizes range from 1.5"" to 1.75"" wide). SinkShroom Chrome fits in virtually all bathroom sink drains, which are typically 1"" to 1.4"" wide (simply unscrew your cover or remove the single holding screw under your sink). DrainShroom attaches to any power drill (sold separately) and works with virtually any home drain. If you grab the complete bundle, you may never have to worry about clogged drains again throughout your home.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I go to learn more about your past products?</strong></p>
<p>You can find more information about us and our products on our official page at <a href=""http://www.TubShroom.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.TubShroom.com</a>. You can also check out some of our past Indigogo campaigns here and here. Here's a piece done by Allure. You might be interested in this recent Forbes article that we were featured in. Lastly, feel free to follow us on Facebook for all our latest updates.</p>
<p><strong>Will these products work in international drains?</strong></p>
<p>The short answer is yes. We have tested our products in many countries such as Canada, Mexico, UK, France, Japan, and more. That's not to say that we can account for every type of drain variation and every country's specific plumbing codes and drain types. We can safely say we have 99.9% compatibility in the USA and Canada and a bit less than that in most developed foreign countries, at least according to our testing, feedback, and data.</p>
<p><strong>What are the product dimensions of the ShowerShroom Ultra?</strong></p>
<p>The ShowerShroom Ultra is just about 5"" x 5"" x 1"". </p>
<p><strong>Do you ship internationally (outside of the USA)?</strong></p>
<p>We do ship internationally to all countries. Travel time will vary, naturally. Please note that you may be responsible for duties, fees, and taxes applicable to your region.</p>
<p><strong>What is your warranty and return policy?</strong></p>
<p>We provide a full 3 months no-questions-asked money-back guarantee from the day you receive your package. If you don't love your product(s) and want to return it, all you have to do is reach out. If any defects or issues arise during that period, we will make it right. If you're happy with the products or service you receive from us, we're confident you will help spread the word as our customers have been doing since day one.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have plans for any other types of products?</strong></p>
<p>We always have multiple new projects in the works at any given time. That's what makes this fun. Some will be hits and some may be misses. Millions of gallons of acid-based liquid cleaners have been poured down the world's drains, releasing toxic fumes into homes and stripping piping integrity in the process. Sure, it can help clear out a clog, but the cost to our environment and our collective health is simply not worth it. There are greener ways to clear clogged drains (boiling hot water helps, baking soda helps, and there are reusable snakes out there like our DrainShroom product, for example). And there are more sustainable ways to keep drains clear. That's where we come in.</p>
</div></div>","We're proud to be protecting nearly 5 million homes from clogged drains, costly plumber visits and--most importantly--toxic liquid chemicals. Now we're back with our next crowdfunding campaign to bring you the most advanced drain protection solution ever created: The all-new ShowerShroom® Ultra. Tell your plumber to lose your number. The revolution in drain protection is here.
A Revolution in Drain Protection
Our story began in late 2015 with the launch of our original award-winning TubShroom® Drain Protector right here on Indigogo. The market and user response was phenomenal, to say the least. We knew we had to keep innovating in the drain protection space in order to help our customers protect every drain in their home, simply and effectively. So we came out with SinkShroom for bathroom sinks, and Kitchen SinkShroom for kitchen sinks, and DrainShroom to clear virtually any drain. Now, by popular demand, we'd like to introduce you to our all-new ShowerShroom Ultra. Let's begin...


The patent-pending ShowerShroom® Ultra borrows from much of the same technology found in our original TubShroom®. To provide superior protection to every drain in the home, we knew we had to tackle the shower next. Ask yourself the following questions: How many strainers have I gone through in the past couple of years? How easy is it to clean my current strainer? Is my current strainer an eyesore? Does the water continue to back up every time I take a shower? How much do I dislike putting my hands on disgusting clumps of wet hair? We addressed all these concerns.


We started with the best materials out there to prevent rusting and to preserve durability. Our stainless steel strainer is made to last the test of time and it looks fabulous in any bathroom. The days of ugly and single-use strainers are gone. We've tested compatibility with a vast number of bathroom shower stall and shower tub drains out there and the fit was terrific virtually every time out. The concept is simple, but the execution is elegant.  

We have filled the strainer with loads of human and pet hair to test just how much it could handle and the results were impressive. We know many of you out there have long hair or have family members with long hair, so the amount of times your drains clog on a yearly basis can get unbearable. No matter how full the strainer portion was, the water continued to flow through the metal and silicone cylindrical holes and the drain remained clog-free after months of use. Mission accomplished.

Did we mention how easy it is to clean the ShowerShroom Ultra? Simply grab the center soft ""Mushroom"" part out of the main strainer body, then wipe off any accumulated hair with a paper towel--no mess, no fuss. Many strainers make it unnecessarily difficult to pull the hair off and the unsightly wet hair is often on display the entire time. Our calling card is ease of use. 

Just look at that beautiful piece of craftsmanship of our unit and then visualize the dinky & bland plastic colored strainers we often find littered on store shelves. The soft brushed lines and jet black center cylinder and trim really make our unit pop and matches virtually any shower stall or shower tub aesthetic. Form and function in one package.

Just keep flowing, just keep flow...ing. Water gets through--hair doesn't. When clumps of hair and gunk gather in your drain, the result is slowed or clogged drains. It's time to take back your bathroom. We've engineered the ShowerShroom® Ultra to sit perfectly flat in your stand-up shower stall drain or bathtub drain, covering one edge to the other uniformly so that water faces no resistance in making its way down the drain, while all the hair gets snagged on the black strainer, out of sight. Showers and tubs have an indiscernible taper towards the drain opening so that gravity pulls water and hair where they need to go. Don't let your strainer be a hindrance to science.


Our research shows that the vast majority of clogs occur in shower tub and shower stall drains. Virtually every home in the world has a shower or bathtub because that's where people give their kids and pets baths and where they take their showers. The number one cause of clogged drains is long hair. The longer the hair and the more people or pets in the home, the higher the likelihood of clogs. Given all this, we knew we had to optimize our ShowerShroom Ultra for both shower and bathtub drains. From the precise sizing of the cylinder to the placement of each and every hole, we put literally years of testing into this upgrade.

And it's nearly here! The latest evolution of our award-winning TubShroom® family of drain protectors is the ShowerShroom Ultra. We can't begin to tell you how many random 'Shroom owners have emailed us, visited us at trade shows, or just talked to us in person about how much they love their TubShroom and SinkShroom products. We want to take this moment to thank each and every one of you who have trusted us with your drains by bringing a 'Shroom product home with you.

We went back to the drawing board and figured out ways to further improve water flow. No one wants to stand in ankle-high soapy water while showering. We have not only achieved our best flow rate testing to date, we have also ensured that even abnormally shorter or wider drains get great drainage results with the ShowerShroom Ultra. As always, hair is caught out of sight and clean-up is a breeze. Now, with ShowerShroom Ultra, you can go longer (sometimes months instead of weeks) between cleanings. When the center cylinder is full of hair, just grab a paper towel or tissue paper and swipe that bundle of hair right off into the trash. 

Award-Winning Add-Ons
We have been delivering cutting-edge drain protection products since 2015. We know many of you want time-saving solutions for every drain in your home so we've decided to offer some of our best complementary products in bundles with the new ShowerShroom Ultra (see the ""Rewards"" options on the right side of this page for all the combinations) so you could knock out two or three birds with one stone. Imagine a life entirely without clogs? The four bundle options include the TubShroom Chrome which is optimized for bathtub drains, the SinkShroom Chrome which is for bathroom sink drains, the Kitchen SinkShroom, and the DrainShroom Universal Drain Snake. Here's a brief description of each:

We'd like to take a moment to apologize in advance for showing all that wet hair in pictures, but there's no better way than showing exactly how well our patented TubShroom Chrome technology works than with an image. In short, there's a bottom flange that sits inside your tub drain where all the hair is neatly caught out of sight while the water continues to flow--as it should--through the dozens of strategically placed holes throughout the perfectly-sized cylinder and mushroom head.

What TubShroom does for tub drains, the SinkShroom Chrome does for bathroom sink drains. Hair, jewelry, and other objects can't get past the SinkShroom. Dual ""arms"" help hold the unit in place so the water can continue to flow without interruption. Our original SinkShroom design raised over $100k on crowdfunding campaigns and thousands still use it to this day. 

The patent-pending Kitchen SinkShroom® borrows from much of the same technology found in our original TubShroom®. To provide superior protection to every drain in the home, we knew we had to tackle the kitchen sink next. We started with the best materials out there to prevent rusting and to preserve durability.

And last, but not least, we have the DrainShroom Universal Drain Snake that works with virtually any drain in your home. Coming in at a lengthy 42"", the DrainShroom gets to where it needs to and snags those nasty balls of hair with ease. The DrainShroom attaches to any power drill (note: power drill not included) to create an easy-to-use and highly effective rotating mini snake.

You could always pay it forward to a friend since you'll be living the clog-free life. 

Our ShowerShroom family of products have been around for some time and we've received a plethora of glowing media coverage and industry awards. Check out some of the key highlights below.

<p>Touch, double touch, long press, it’s a single product that can perform many actions, which <strong>can be implemented in a matter of minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Each SmartBug device is equipped with <strong>many sensors that can measure temperature, humidity, listen to sounds, accurately measure power usage. </strong>It is also provided with a multi-radio wireless mesh (internode), WiFi (for Internet connection), and BT low energy (to be extended with additional devices).</p>
<p>There are many reasons to consider SmartBug as a revolutionary solution, better than anything on the market. The following chart illustrates just the basic functionalities:</p>

<p>SmartBug is the product of a group of electronic and computer engineers who wanted to create the definitive solution in home automation: a scalable and enabling wall switch that - <strong>without the need of a hub</strong> - can unlock all the potential of a smart home in a traditional environment.</p>
<p>It was 2017 and by interpreting the trends identified by GFK and anticipating the technology behind Home Automation we followed the intuition that in a short period there was going to be the need for a new standard. That’s when we started to rethink the intelligent devices in terms of <strong>interaction with the users</strong> rather than in terms of available technology: after a few months of work, we created an initial version of the system, which presented all the main characteristics that we offer today.  An elegant, flexible, intuitive product that <strong>can turn your home into an intelligent environment.</strong></p>

<li>
<strong>Audio Recognition</strong> - Thanks to the digital microphone, each SmartBug can recognize voices, commands and cries for help. Worried about your privacy? This feature will only work if you download the corresponding plugin.</li>
<li>
<strong>Bluetooth</strong> - To allow a good connection with wireless devices and appliances around the house we equipped SmartBug with a Bluetooth 4.0 (BT) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).</li>
<li>
<strong>Humidity sensor </strong>- The humidity sensor is a true life changer, because it can accurately measure the humidity levels in every room where there is a SmartBug installed. Surely, your body will thank you for this.</li>
<li>
<strong>Temperature sensor</strong> - The temperature sensor inside SmartBug allows users to monitor and control the temperature in every room in which there is a device installed. </li>
<li>
<strong>IR control</strong> - Want to pilot or control an older generation device? With SmartBug's IR transmitter your smartphone can become the remote control for all those devices and appliances that have an IR receiver.</li>
<li>
<strong>Touch Sensor</strong> - It's all about the touch! Everything looks so elegant and modern with touch control! This is why SmartBug has a touch sensor. </li>
<li>
<strong>Buzzer</strong> - So, we said that SmartBug can't talk to you unless you pair it with a smart speaker (with bluetooth for instance) that gives it a voice but this doesn't mean it cannot communicate. As a matter of fact it's quite the opposite: the device can communicate through the built-in buzzer and lights. </li>
<li>
<strong>RGB LED</strong> - Just like the buzzer, the RGB Led can be used to allow the communications between user and device. The lights can signal various conditions and you can choose the color and its corresponding meaning. </li>
<li>
<strong>On-Off Relay </strong>- The on-off relay is what really controls your lights, washing machine, irrigation system, oven, etc. </li>
<li>
<strong>Multimeter</strong> - To find out and monitor how much voltage a certain device or appliance is consuming, we equipped SmartBug with a multimeter to exactly inform the user of the state of these devices. </li>
<li>
<strong>Wireless mesh</strong> - What happens when a smart device loses pair with the access point? It usually stops working until someone notices! Not with SmartBug though: thanks to its mesh network, all devices can create a network enabling one another without a signal repeater thus not adding extra worries to the users.</li>

Thanks to a partnership with an industrial PCBA factory we have already developed the hardware production line and ensured a great design. Software has also been completed and tested both in terms of embedded firmware, plugins and cloud infrastructure. Our prototype testing is complete and we have our manufacturing scheduled. SmartBug is now ready for the scale-up towards mass production. However, given the time we are globally facing because of the Covid19 pandemic, the main risk for the project is a potential delay in the distribution of the product. We have done and will do our best to take all hidden risks into account to make sure that our backers receive SmartBug timely and start enjoying its great features as soon as possible.</p><p> </p></div>","SmartBug is a sleek and unintrusive device that hides inside your in-wall socket -  but it turns your entire home into a live smart environment. Thanks to its collective “swarm intelligence”, SmartBug lets you design a smart home that fits in with your lifestyle.
 

 
SmartBug is a single device, but it is also a collection of devices that can automate complex and engaging scenarios. With a set of SmartBugs, you can regulate the temperature, operate your AC, create an alarm system, monitor your power usage and much more. Its artificial intelligence learns from your behaviors and discreetly supports you as you go about your day.





Touch, double touch, long press, it’s a single product that can perform many actions, which can be implemented in a matter of minutes.
Each SmartBug device is equipped with many sensors that can measure temperature, humidity, listen to sounds, accurately measure power usage. It is also provided with a multi-radio wireless mesh (internode), WiFi (for Internet connection), and BT low energy (to be extended with additional devices).
There are many reasons to consider SmartBug as a revolutionary solution, better than anything on the market. The following chart illustrates just the basic functionalities:

 
SmartBug is the product of a group of electronic and computer engineers who wanted to create the definitive solution in home automation: a scalable and enabling wall switch that - without the need of a hub - can unlock all the potential of a smart home in a traditional environment.
It was 2017 and by interpreting the trends identified by GFK and anticipating the technology behind Home Automation we followed the intuition that in a short period there was going to be the need for a new standard. That’s when we started to rethink the intelligent devices in terms of interaction with the users rather than in terms of available technology: after a few months of work, we created an initial version of the system, which presented all the main characteristics that we offer today.  An elegant, flexible, intuitive product that can turn your home into an intelligent environment.
 
SmartBug is equipped with a 32bit dual-core microcontroller, a soft-defined triple standard radio interface (WiFi, wireless mesh, Bluetooth LE), temperature/humidity sensors, a digital microphone, high efficiency LED, an IR (infrared) LED (for remote control emulation), one buzzer, a multimeter (real-time current, voltage, and power measurement), onetouch-sensitive input. A/C power 85V - 260V AC 50-60Hz (worldwide compatible). Supports power loads up to 2200W, both AC and DC.

Most smart switches that enable many features and scenarios, require a neutral wire in order to work properly . This requirement also applies for SmartBug, given the many functionalities it brings along. 
 
Every single SmartBug is equipped with the above mentioned hardware specs. All these features are what can truly automate the homes and we wanted to create a product that could have them all integrated.  But let's move one step at a time and discover what are all these features for. 

Audio Recognition - Thanks to the digital microphone, each SmartBug can recognize voices, commands and cries for help. Worried about your privacy? This feature will only work if you download the corresponding plugin.

Bluetooth - To allow a good connection with wireless devices and appliances around the house we equipped SmartBug with a Bluetooth 4.0 (BT) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

Humidity sensor - The humidity sensor is a true life changer, because it can accurately measure the humidity levels in every room where there is a SmartBug installed. Surely, your body will thank you for this.

Temperature sensor - The temperature sensor inside SmartBug allows users to monitor and control the temperature in every room in which there is a device installed. 

IR control - Want to pilot or control an older generation device? With SmartBug's IR transmitter your smartphone can become the remote control for all those devices and appliances that have an IR receiver.

Touch Sensor - It's all about the touch! Everything looks so elegant and modern with touch control! This is why SmartBug has a touch sensor. 

Buzzer - So, we said that SmartBug can't talk to you unless you pair it with a smart speaker (with bluetooth for instance) that gives it a voice but this doesn't mean it cannot communicate. As a matter of fact it's quite the opposite: the device can communicate through the built-in buzzer and lights. 

RGB LED - Just like the buzzer, the RGB Led can be used to allow the communications between user and device. The lights can signal various conditions and you can choose the color and its corresponding meaning. 

On-Off Relay - The on-off relay is what really controls your lights, washing machine, irrigation system, oven, etc. 

Multimeter - To find out and monitor how much voltage a certain device or appliance is consuming, we equipped SmartBug with a multimeter to exactly inform the user of the state of these devices. 

Wireless mesh - What happens when a smart device loses pair with the access point? It usually stops working until someone notices! Not with SmartBug though: thanks to its mesh network, all devices can create a network enabling one another without a signal repeater thus not adding extra worries to the users.
 Wall boxes are different within a country so imagine around the world... SmartBug fits in every wall box around the globe without the need to integrate pieces to make it fit and has the smallest footprint in the market!It disappears inside the wall, replacing your existing switch and enabling touch control. There is no need for Gateways. Each SmartBug node can act as a gateway, thanks to a self-configuring wireless mesh network (internode), WiFi (access point to connect to the internet), and BT (to extend with additional devices: external sensors, audio speakers, etc.).Also, Alexa and Google Home can be enabled: both with physical devices or through the Cloud. It can add unlimited intelligent capabilities to any existing device in your home and of any generation (e.g. washing machine, dishwasher, heater, boiler, TV, AC, etc). SmartBug can interact with just about anything with an on/off switch or remote control. Whether you live alone or have a large family, the goal of making the most out of your home is a common one. We all know that the perfect smart home isn't only the one that listens to you and accomplishes all the tasks correctly.Whatever is the way you live your life, your house should always match it, and with SmartBug it will! Want an easier life? SmartBug is right by your side!You can create your own personalized scenarios: turn all your lights off or deactivate your appliances with one single touch. Keep your power usage under close attention through the app or check on your older generation devices and make them smart! Protect your home and family.How many times have you asked yourself, have I closed all my windows? By adding an additional sensor, you can take a quick look at our app and make sure that everything is okay.Furthermore, the new SmartBug will also be able to notify you when your child is crying or if any relative is in need of your support.Do you have any pets? Keep track of their location around the house by adding a BLE Beacon to their collar. This device was also thought for YOU! Keep everything under control. Set the perfect temperature for when you return home or schedule your devices so they turn on in the timeframes that also make you save on the bills.Humidity and temperature sensors will always be active to monitor the environments where you spend most of your time.  The best for the environment. Your new SmartBug is green too! Check your power usage, the energy performances of your entire household, and save on your power bills!The control of your power loads will also allow you to avoid triggering the circuit breaker!  Important thing to mention is the fact that SmartBug is an open platform. The idea of making the technology behind SmartBug an open platform for developers was to give the device maximum flexibility. Therefore, if the app doesn’t have a particular plugin that the user needs and the user is or knows a developer, they can improve the possibilities unleashed by the device by creating the plugin wanted.Each new plugin that is made available adds functionality to the system with a mechanism typical of open innovation. By doing so, these third party developers can also make an earning with the sales of the smart plugins they've created! 
 
Users will be able to control all their devices and appliances with their smartphones by downloading the app controller. See this as a sort of marketplace or app store: through this app, users will download the smart plugins they're interested in for their homes (for instance, you may want to control your power usage but not your blinds). These smart plugins will not be stored in the cloud but in the device itself.
 But why are plugins so important to us (and to you)?Plugins are what gives SmartBug endless possibilities and - since it’s an open platform - enable third party developers to create abilities which extend the application. This will truly make the device limitless and will easily support new features that can automate your entire household.Once the device is configured through the app and you have downloaded all the plugins of your interest, SmartBug will work anywhere, even without the need of a good WiFi connection or the smartphone.NO SMARTPHONE REQUIRED, or at least, you’ll only need the smartphone to configure the device and download the plugins you’re interested in and then you can just forget about it. That’s right, because SmartBug stores the plugins in its own memory therefore without the need of the Cloud and will recognize your gestures easily, subsequently activating what you want. Let's get into closer detail of these smart plugins.

Who knows, maybe your friends find it best suits them!                                 Spread the word and become a SmartBug ambassador! SmartBug is one of the official sponsors of the “Politecnico di Milano” and “Osservatori.net” in their mission to generate and share knowledge on the Internet of Things to contribute to its development in the Italian market. Risks and challengesSmartBug is the result of the hard work of a highly skilled team of professionals. All with extensive experience in electronic design, software development, embedded systems, and mechanical design. Thanks to a partnership with an industrial PCBA factory we have already developed the hardware production line and ensured a great design. Software has also been completed and tested both in terms of embedded firmware, plugins and cloud infrastructure. Our prototype testing is complete and we have our manufacturing scheduled. SmartBug is now ready for the scale-up towards mass production. However, given the time we are globally facing because of the Covid19 pandemic, the main risk for the project is a potential delay in the distribution of the product. We have done and will do our best to take all hidden risks into account to make sure that our backers receive SmartBug timely and start enjoying its great features as soon as possible.",44.0,5,"1 Campaign

That is the strongest encryption used commercially today. However, unlike traditional VPN vendors, we don't require our users to install software or even know how to operate a VPN. Additionally, our patent-pending technology intelligently bypasses streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu so that users' online streaming experience is not disrupted.

First, we use numerous threat intelligence feeds from across the globe. This is a widely used method in the enterprise world and works great for detecting 'known' threats. However, threat intelligence sources do little to nothing when faced with 'unknown and novel' attacks. That's why we have engineered our own detection engine that uses Artificial Intelligence to detect such attacks across our platform! For example, in order to detect bot-related traffic, we run anonymized DNS activities through our machine learning models in real-time. We also detect 'unknown' phishing domains based on the characteristics of the domain and the website. Also, a proprietary Syfer technology.</p><p><strong>Domain Classification</strong>: Our domain classification capability is powered by an innovative third-party technology, that unlike legacy solutions such as OpenDNS, offers real-time analysis and categorization of 'unknown' websites.</p><p><strong>Hardware</strong>: Syfer's custom hardware is designed with encryption performance in mind.

Syfer proudly runs its own Global Anonymizing Network - zero logging, low latency, optimized geo-based routing, and our VPN footprint is growing daily! Testimonials As Featured On Syfer Protection With Any Provider   Practical, Yet Sophisticated DesignGoodbye, ugly black box! The shape of Syfer is inspired by the work of Pritzker Prize-winning Architect Zaha Hadid and will be a great addition to any home décor.  Under The HoodHardware Information: Syfer One offers maximum unencrypted throughput of *350 Mbps* with global proprietary VPN speeds of up to *100 Mbps* (improvements coming in 2020). Privacy: Our privacy protection is based on AES-256 encryption and SSL tunneling. That is the strongest encryption used commercially today. However, unlike traditional VPN vendors, we don't require our users to install software or even know how to operate a VPN. Additionally, our patent-pending technology intelligently bypasses streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu so that users' online streaming experience is not disrupted. No need to toggle VPN on and off, and no need to exclude devices from your VPN.Security: We take two different approaches to detecting malicious activity. First, we use numerous threat intelligence feeds from across the globe. This is a widely used method in the enterprise world and works great for detecting 'known' threats. However, threat intelligence sources do little to nothing when faced with 'unknown and novel' attacks. That's why we have engineered our own detection engine that uses Artificial Intelligence to detect such attacks across our platform! For example, in order to detect bot-related traffic, we run anonymized DNS activities through our machine learning models in real-time. We also detect 'unknown' phishing domains based on the characteristics of the domain and the website. Also, a proprietary Syfer technology.Domain Classification: Our domain classification capability is powered by an innovative third-party technology, that unlike legacy solutions such as OpenDNS, offers real-time analysis and categorization of 'unknown' websites.Hardware: Syfer's custom hardware is designed with encryption performance in mind. With our powerful ARM processor and gigabit ethernet connection, you'll never experience slowed speeds.And that’s just the beginning… (check out our Technology page for more)  Secure From Concept To CompletionOur technology has been tested and proven.

To provide superior protection to every drain in the home, we knew we had to tackle the kitchen sink next. Ask yourself the following questions: How many strainers have I gone through in the past couple of years? How easy is it to clean my current strainer? Is my current strainer an eye sore? Does the water continue to back up every time I wash my dishes? How much do I dislike sticking my hand in dirty dish water where sharp knives can be lurking? We addressed all these concerns. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/508/972/f0aed672744586ce0aa485d978eade51_original.gif?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1536604691&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=67c2bf60ade15f800e0ae647e00c4e4a"" src=""""/>  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537409260/kpnokwswdo9dzontsr63.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We started with the best materials out there to prevent rusting and to preserve durability.

Simply grab the center ""Shroom"" cylinder to pull the Kitchen SinkShroom® out of the drain, then rotate your fingers to the edge before tapping the debris away into the garbage.

Virtually every home in the world has a bathtub drain because that's where people give their kids and pets baths and where they take their showers. The number one cause of clogged drains is long hair. The longer the hair and the more people or pets in the home, the higher the likelihood of clogs. Given all this, we knew we had to optimize our Ultra TubShroom for bathtub drains, first and foremost. From the precise sizing of the cylinder to the placement of each and every hole, we put literally years of testing into this upgrade. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1537411401/iudxo0nqq3ntkstgunm5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Our original TubShroom requires a crossbar in the drain to sit up properly.

Serge and his wife, Elena, were fed up with their ever-clogging bath tub drains. You see, the couple have two young daughters and multiple pets in their apartment, so it was no surprise that their drains clogged so often. Serge perfected his original TubShroom design and, along with the help of Solyman, the duo brought it to the masses via a Indiegogo campaign, which turned out to be the launchpad the fledgling company needed to go on to become the leader in drain protection that it is today. Here's some words from Serge:</p><p><strong>Dear backers, </strong></p><p><strong>S</strong>ome of you have been with us since our very first project launched in 2015, and some of you will join the ""Shroom"" family for the first time. Regardless, we are very thankful for your support and trust in the quality of our products. Thank to our early adapters, our original TubShroom was born, eventually becoming the #1 best-seller on Amazon and at many major big box retail stores. We're proud to say that since the launch in 2016, we have helped to protect close to 3 million drains worldwide. </p><p><strong>W</strong>e must say that there were a few bumps on the road. Inventory shortages, shipping delays, intellectual property battles, and more. We have had to learn the ins and outs of plumbing, drainage, and design. Furthermore, we have visited many countries around the world to compare and analyze drain types. Our goal is to protect every drain in your home and with the launch of this Indiegogo campaign, we feel we have gotten that much closer.

Now we're back with our fourth Indiegogo campaign to bring you the most-advanced drain protection solutions ever created: The all-new Kitchen SinkShroom®, the all-new Ultra TubShroom®, and the all-new StopShroom® Plug. Let's begin...The patent-pending Kitchen SinkShroom® borrows from much of the same technology found in our original TubShroom®. To provide superior protection to every drain in the home, we knew we had to tackle the kitchen sink next. Ask yourself the following questions: How many strainers have I gone through in the past couple of years? How easy is it to clean my current strainer? Is my current strainer an eye sore? Does the water continue to back up every time I wash my dishes? How much do I dislike sticking my hand in dirty dish water where sharp knives can be lurking? We addressed all these concerns.   We started with the best materials out there to prevent rusting and to preserve durability. Our stainless steel is made to last the test of time and it looks fabulous in any kitchen. The days of ugly strainers are gone. We've tested compatibility with a vast number of kitchen sink drains out there and the fit was perfect every single time. We have filled the basket with rice, vegetables, crumbs, garbage, meats--you name it. You could say we threw the kitchen sink at it. No mater how full the basket was, the water continued to flow through the center cylinder holes and the sink remained clog-free. Mission accomplished. Did we mention how easy it is to clean, even with one hand? Simply grab the center ""Shroom"" cylinder to pull the Kitchen SinkShroom® out of the drain, then rotate your fingers to the edge before tapping the debris away into the garbage. Many strainers make it unnecessarily difficult to get a hold of the sharp edges when it's time to remove it from the sink. Other strainers are a chore to clean out properly. You know what I'm talking about.Just look at that beautiful piece of craftsmanship and then visualize the dinky plastic colored strainers we often find littered on store shelves. The soft brushed lines and jet black center cylinder really make our unit pop.  Just keep flowing, just keep flow...ing. Water gets through--food particles don't. When debris gathers in your drain, the result is slowed or clogged drains, smelly sinks, and our favorite little buggers: the infamous fruit flies. All they want is somewhere sweet and damp to lay their eggs in. Won't you be my neighbor? It's time to take back your kitchen. We've engineered the Kitchen SinkShroom® to sit perfectly flat in your drain, covering one edge to the other uniformly so that water and food particles face no resistance in making their way into the basket. What's the use of a strainer if garbage and debris remain hanging around around the rim? We've instituted a strict no loitering policy. Kitchen sinks have an indiscernible taper towards the drain opening so that gravity pulls water and food where they need to go. Don't let your strainer be a hindrance to science.  Here's a sneak peak (above) of our work-in-progress retail packaging for the Kitchen SinkShroom®. The best way to get your product in front of as many people as possible is through traditional retail. If we can make you early-adopters happy with the product this holiday season, we're confident we can do the same for the rest of the market later.  Awwww yis, it's finally here. The latest evolution of our award-winning TubShroom® drain protector has arrived. We can't begin to tell you how many random TubShroom owners have emailed us, visited us at shows, or just talked to us in person about how much they love their TubShrooms. Sure, we have also released the popular SinkShroom for bathroom sinks, the ShowerShroom for stand-up shower stall drains, and the StopShroom version 1.0 drain cover, but the product we get the most positive feedback for is definitely TubShroom. We want to take this moment to thank each and every one of you who have trusted us with your drains by bringing a 'Shroom product home with you.   We'd like to take a moment to apologize in advance for showing all that hair, but there's no better way than showing exactly how well our patented TubShroom technology works than with a 5-second animated gif. In short, there's a bottom flange that sits inside your drain where all the hair is neatly caught out of sight while the water continues to flow, as it should, through the dozens of strategically placed holes throughout the perfectly-sized cylinder and mushroom head.  So what's so much better about this new version of TubShroom that we're so brazenly calling Ultra TubShroom®? Our original TubShroom still works fabulously well, as evidenced by the over 15,000+ glowing reviews you can find for it across the internet.  We don't believe one should leave well enough alone. We live, breathe and--sometimes even--dream drain products, you see. We have improved upon nearly every aspect of our original TubShroom. Our research shows that the vast majority of clogs occur in bathtub drains. Virtually every home in the world has a bathtub drain because that's where people give their kids and pets baths and where they take their showers. The number one cause of clogged drains is long hair. The longer the hair and the more people or pets in the home, the higher the likelihood of clogs. Given all this, we knew we had to optimize our Ultra TubShroom for bathtub drains, first and foremost. From the precise sizing of the cylinder to the placement of each and every hole, we put literally years of testing into this upgrade. Our original TubShroom requires a crossbar in the drain to sit up properly. While the majority of drains do come with a crossbar, there are some drains out there that lack this feature. The Ultra TubShroom rectifies this with a curved head containing elegant protrusions that prevent the unit from going lower than it should. This means all that hair and water always has a place to go. Next up, our customers asked for improved durability and longevity. While our original TubShroom could last years with regular cleanings and maintenance, we sometimes heard complaints about soap and mildew buildup. Drains are a dark, damp and nasty place. Mildew buildup is only natural. The Ultra TubShroom has solid stainless steel parts to help address this issue. Cleaning and maintenance has never been easier. We went back to the drawing board and figured out ways to further improve water flow. No one wants to stand in ankle-high soapy water while showering. We have not only achieved our best flow rate testing to date, we have also ensured that even abnormally shorter or wider drains get great drainage results with the Ultra TubShroom. As always, hair is caught out of sight and clean-up is a breeze. Now, with Ultra TubShroom, you can go longer (sometimes months instead of weeks) between cleanings. When the cylinder is full of hair, just grab a paper towel or tissue paper and swipe that bundle of hair right off into the trash. Although our data shows that the vast majority of bathtub drains out there fall in the 1.5"" to 1.75"" range, there is a small percentage of you out there with abnormally-sized drains. That's OK. People come in different shapes and sizes too. So we went the extra mile to include interchangeable adapters that support the most typical 1.5""-1.75"" drains as well as extra adapters to fit most larger 2"" drains and smaller 1.25"" drains. Optimizing Ultra TubShroom to fit every imaginable bathroom drain out there would mean having to sacrifice on it's superb tub drain performance, so we decided to make the perfect tub drain strainer-- first and foremost--and provide support for most other drains as a secondary bonus.    Last but not least, many of our customers have wanted to be able to take baths by plugging up their drain.  In the past, we recommended using their old stoppers in tandem with TubShroom by swapping them out depending on the need. Now, we've decided to include our all-new patent-pending StopShroom® Plug with every Ultra TubShroom. Check it out below... We looked at all the stopper solutions out there and we knew there had to be a better way. Current options include drain covers (we even made one ourselves!), ivory rubber plugs that are not universal, and the removable metal or plastic stoppers that often come with the drains when you move in. They each have their flaws. For example, the built-in ones inevitably start to leak so bath time is a race against the clock. Our StopShroom® Plug solution is simple yet effective. The StopShroom Plug is made out of 100% durable, BPA-free silicone, so it can take a beating from those harsh drain conditions and keep on ticking. Our design was inspired by the cork concept you find in various bottles. The precise sizing, the angularity, and the graduated rings all combine to form a product that works really, really well. It's may not be as sexy as the other new releases, but it truly gets the job done like a boss. The StopShroom Plug is compatible with virtually all bathtub drains (the typical size ranging from 1.5"" to 1.75"") and bathroom sink drains (the typical size ranges from 1"" to 1.25"") and everything in between. We even made it is so it can work with slightly larger and smaller drains. It's easy to use. Just push down with a bit of force until the StopShroom Plug comes to rest. The ring just inside the drain forms a tight inner seal while the ring that's just outside the drain opening repels water from the outside. It's tag-team, baby. Whenever it's time to take a bath or shave, place your StopShroom Plug in the drain before filling things  up. Once you're done and ready to drain the tub or sink, pull the StopShroom Plug out and quickly replace it with your Ultra TubShroom (or other relevant 'Shroom product) and voilà, you're protected. Virtually all built-in stoppers can be popped out or unscrewed and removed.     A snippet of praise from the media:Amazon reviewers love their TubShrooms:  In late 2015, Juka Innovations Corporation was started in Glen Cove, NY by Serge Karnegie and Solyman Najimi--two long-time friends. Serge and his wife, Elena, were fed up with their ever-clogging bath tub drains. You see, the couple have two young daughters and multiple pets in their apartment, so it was no surprise that their drains clogged so often. Serge perfected his original TubShroom design and, along with the help of Solyman, the duo brought it to the masses via a Indiegogo campaign, which turned out to be the launchpad the fledgling company needed to go on to become the leader in drain protection that it is today. Here's some words from Serge:Dear backers, Some of you have been with us since our very first project launched in 2015, and some of you will join the ""Shroom"" family for the first time. Regardless, we are very thankful for your support and trust in the quality of our products. Thank to our early adapters, our original TubShroom was born, eventually becoming the #1 best-seller on Amazon and at many major big box retail stores. We're proud to say that since the launch in 2016, we have helped to protect close to 3 million drains worldwide. We must say that there were a few bumps on the road. Inventory shortages, shipping delays, intellectual property battles, and more. We have had to learn the ins and outs of plumbing, drainage, and design. Furthermore, we have visited many countries around the world to compare and analyze drain types. Our goal is to protect every drain in your home and with the launch of this Indiegogo campaign, we feel we have gotten that much closer. Our team's focus is on producing innovative products that are save people money, that solve real-world problems, and that look great. Thank you for taking this journey with us. We promise to do our utmost to continue to provide amazing products and terrific support.

The system works with voice control or a push of a button in the app - seniors with walkers or wheelchairs don’t have to struggle to open and close doors.

 

 
Smooth Sliding, No Noise
After countless mechanical testing and adjustment, we are pleased to present this smart barn door opener kit featuring a small yet powerful motor that drives the door open smoothly while producing no noise. Plus, enjoy the ease-of-use to just plug it in and forget about it. Loaded with energy-efficient features, this low-maintenance opener is engineered to withstand a lifetime of use and offers peace of mind that your door will remain beautiful and functional for years to come.


 
Soft Close and Remote Control
Worry no more about door slamming noises! Our smart door opener is designed with the hall-effect sensor to deliver a quiet and soft door closing experience for you and your family. Included in the set, you will also get a barn door remote control which comes with 3M tape for easy installation. Whether you want to use voice control, phone app, or just pressing a button on the remote, we've got you covered.
 
 
Versatile, Functional, and Aesthetically Pleasing.
Your barn door coupled with our smart hands-free opener is an easy way to add separation and style to bathrooms, closets, kitchens, and more. Rustic enough to highlight that charming vintage vibe but modern enough to add textures and patterns that give your room just enough punch. Plus, it takes up less floor space than a traditional swinging door – the perfect solution for a tight space.

Why We Love These Homes
They are beautiful.
The walls are extremely strong:  They are made from interlocking reinforced concrete block about 2 feet thick.  
They are able to withstand hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fires, termites, etc...
They are very low maintenance: There is no need to paint, no siding to replace,  no rotten window sills, etc.
Unlike most of our  current construction materials, concrete does not give off harmful vapors (low VOC).  Portland cement is also naturally anti fungal so molds do not feed on it as they do wood, drywall, and latex.  This all means that the indoor air is much cleaner.
These structures are simple to assemble.  Many homeowners build these homes themselves.
The block can serve as both the exterior and interior finish on the walls.  Once the block are assembled, there is no need for additional finishes.  
The insulation is built into the block.
The concrete in the block can be stained to resemble different colors of limestone.
They are made from a sustainable resource.
Their longevity reduces the costs of maintenance, long term construction, and environmental impact.
Did we mention that they are really beautiful, really low maintenance, and last a really long time?  We love these homes!

Imagine living in a home that inspires you.  Imagine being able to pass it on for generations.   Imagine the freedom that comes from not having to maintain it. Imagine a home designed to withstand fire, hurricanes, tornadoes, water and termites.
Imagine being able to build your home yourself.  Imagine ordering a home and the important detailing is already finished.  The process is simple; the results are elegant and beautiful.

<p>
                        The purpose of God's Designs, Inc. is to enrich lives by making homes more pleasant
                        places for everyday living. We start by collecting donated household furnishings
                        which are stored in a warehouse and then furnish homes and apartments for those
                        in need at no cost to them.</p>
<p>
                        Our motto is ""making a house a home"" and this is accomplished by adding additional
                        items, such as pictures, floral arrangements, curtains and other accessories.</p>
<p>
                        The people we help are generally referred to us by different social agencies such
                        as Center for Women and Families, Salvation Army, Women's Choice, Network Center
                        for Community Change, Cabinet for Health and Family Services, Scholar House, Fuller
                        Center for Housing and many others as well as various churches. We also have helped
                        a number of seminary students who come from abroad with nothing but a suitcase and
                        their books.</p>
<p>
                        The people we serve are usually coming out of a homeless state and have no resources
                        or alternatives to acquire items needed to furnish their homes. Many of our clients
                        are living with the barest of essentials, frequently sleeping on the floor and cooking
                        and eating with limited kitchen utensils.</p>
<p>
                        After an initial visit with the client to determine their needs the home is completely
                        furnished. We like to work while they are out of the house and when they return,
                        having left in most cases an empty house to one completely furnished, they are somewhat
                        overwhelmed. We call it a mini ""extreme makeover"". We conclude with a house blessing.
                        We also have a mentoring team called Ambassadors on Assignment who follow up with

<p><b>HOW WAS SOLARLAYER BORN?</b></p>
<p>We love the idea of a green, sustainable world. But we know how hard to achieve that is. Power generation has some mayor difficulties and distribution too(being gigantic costs and energy loss over distance the main barrier).</p>
<p>We set out to invent a technology that although revolutionary would not disrupt the industrial processes already established in society. Distribution of energy through standard power lines is very expensive (from 300,000USD each mile of linear power-line), so something that would generate and distribute on every local area is a mayor advance. We work in the electric engineering sector designing high-voltage electric towers, engineering complete power lines, large-scale transformation stations and power generation plants.</p>
<p>We also inspect the construction of these works and know how complex it is. So we invented something that we knew it could be developed and installed hassle-free. It might sound simple, but it took us years of experimenting.</p>
<p>We are experts in the field with almost 40 years of experience and we know that once in the market, this will be huge and will empower humanity.</p>

<h1>SOLARLAYER™ OVERVIEW</h1>
<p>The system can be used as an additive for asphalt and for house paintings. If installed correctly it can generate enough electricity for a normal house. It is very easy to install. The basic electric components look very much like salt and must be mixed with the paintings before application. After the painting has been finished, a special wire, that will ship with the box, has to be installed 2 cm inside the limit of the paint all the way to the energy stabiliser.</p>
<p><b>HOW DOES SOLAR LAYER™ WORK?</b></p>
<p>The SOLARLAYER™ system consists of three basic components: The conductor fibre, photovoltaic cells and an energy stabiliser.</p>
<p>The conductor is a super thin 2µm (microns) copper-based alloy fibre that acts as the basic conducting surface. This fibre can be fabricated as a cloth(thicker but more efficient ) or as a powder.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">T</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">he photovoltaic cells are the most innovative and revolutionary of the three components. They have the capacity to transform light sources to electricity, to work as an intelligent conductor and to sense the magnetic north. Cells surfaces have a series of conducting and non-conducting areas.</span></figure>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/060/212/e4d087528f54de02046353cb73a37c4c_original.png?v=1435538270&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=0f0a399d673e8b858b620767afd195e3"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>Through a special process, each photovoltaic cell is able to use this areas to intelligently allow and stop energy flow from and to the fibre conductor avoiding a shortcut chaos.</p>
<p>Most importantly, each cell will re-route energy coming from the fibre to the magnetic north. This is the way by which the flow of energy always finds its way to the right place. At the top of the system, energy is recollected by a special copper wire.</p>
<p>The third component is the tension stabiliser. It receives electric current from different parts of the conductor fibre by the copper wire and it stabilises it before generating a useful current output.</p>
<p>It is important here to note that the copper wire and the tension stabiliser are always installed in the north and the whole system in the South.  This is the only reference the photovoltaic cells have for current re-routing.</p>
<p>The system has been designed to work in 3/12V.</p>
<p>Once the electrical output is obtained, this system is connected to the house grid.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/059/863/99b6aa17cece8d4314aacaa8297149c9_original.jpg?v=1435533494&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=0b869dbf69fdb909798e7d876c87f4dc"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>The prototypes we have manufactured are super light and clear crystals, essential to absorb lots of light.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERS</b></p>
<p>SolarLayer™ will go intro production in 2016 for standard paintings and for asphalt in 2017. We have a lot of work to do in order to take the painting from the Lab to the streets. Because of this, we invite manufacturers, chemical engineers, industrial engineers, councils, universities, governments and other scientific institutions to help us in this profound development.</p>

SolarLayer™ is the world’s first photovoltaic additive that can convert any pavemented road and any constructed surface into a solar energy generator.
HOW WAS SOLARLAYER BORN?
We love the idea of a green, sustainable world. But we know how hard to achieve that is. Power generation has some mayor difficulties and distribution too(being gigantic costs and energy loss over distance the main barrier).
We set out to invent a technology that although revolutionary would not disrupt the industrial processes already established in society. Distribution of energy through standard power lines is very expensive (from 300,000USD each mile of linear power-line), so something that would generate and distribute on every local area is a mayor advance. We work in the electric engineering sector designing high-voltage electric towers, engineering complete power lines, large-scale transformation stations and power generation plants.
We also inspect the construction of these works and know how complex it is. So we invented something that we knew it could be developed and installed hassle-free. It might sound simple, but it took us years of experimenting.
We are experts in the field with almost 40 years of experience and we know that once in the market, this will be huge and will empower humanity.


AS SEEN ON





SOLARLAYER™ OVERVIEW
The system can be used as an additive for asphalt and for house paintings. If installed correctly it can generate enough electricity for a normal house. It is very easy to install. The basic electric components look very much like salt and must be mixed with the paintings before application. After the painting has been finished, a special wire, that will ship with the box, has to be installed 2 cm inside the limit of the paint all the way to the energy stabiliser.
HOW DOES SOLAR LAYER™ WORK?
The SOLARLAYER™ system consists of three basic components: The conductor fibre, photovoltaic cells and an energy stabiliser.
The conductor is a super thin 2µm (microns) copper-based alloy fibre that acts as the basic conducting surface. This fibre can be fabricated as a cloth(thicker but more efficient ) or as a powder.

The photovoltaic cells are the most innovative and revolutionary of the three components. They have the capacity to transform light sources to electricity, to work as an intelligent conductor and to sense the magnetic north. Cells surfaces have a series of conducting and non-conducting areas.


Through a special process, each photovoltaic cell is able to use this areas to intelligently allow and stop energy flow from and to the fibre conductor avoiding a shortcut chaos.
Most importantly, each cell will re-route energy coming from the fibre to the magnetic north. This is the way by which the flow of energy always finds its way to the right place. At the top of the system, energy is recollected by a special copper wire.
The third component is the tension stabiliser. It receives electric current from different parts of the conductor fibre by the copper wire and it stabilises it before generating a useful current output.
It is important here to note that the copper wire and the tension stabiliser are always installed in the north and the whole system in the South.  This is the only reference the photovoltaic cells have for current re-routing.
The system has been designed to work in 3/12V.
Once the electrical output is obtained, this system is connected to the house grid.


The prototypes we have manufactured are super light and clear crystals, essential to absorb lots of light.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERS
SolarLayer™ will go intro production in 2016 for standard paintings and for asphalt in 2017. We have a lot of work to do in order to take the painting from the Lab to the streets. Because of this, we invite manufacturers, chemical engineers, industrial engineers, councils, universities, governments and other scientific institutions to help us in this profound development.

<p>Founded in 2014, TRINUS was created out of a desire to act as a focal point for modern technology, design and user needs. PLANT’S JEWEL represents our first finalized product and featured on lots of Japanese media. It has already been sold to the public domestically in Japan. Our first crowd funding at indiegogo aims to deliver our products to markets out of Japan for the first time. We hope it proves to be the first of many.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477117690/yu4yx8i56e7iccarfg32.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p> <h3>Three Great Features</h3>

<p><b><i>1. Transform an everyday container into a vase</i></b></p>
<p>Using PLANT'S JEWEL, even an ordinary container can become a vase that securely holds the stems of flowers and plants. The design makes it simple to make the most of cut flowers. PLANT’s JEWEL can be used with everyday containers such as bowls and wineglasses for a unique visual impact.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475303847/2015.11.22_0104_tpsruz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b><i>2. Showcase the beauty of solitary flowers</i></b></p>
<p>While cut flowers are beautiful and add so much color to everyday life, they're not always cheap. A display of just one or two cut flowers may look forlorn, but with PLANT'S JEWEL, even a single flower can be held securely to create an eye-catching display.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475303925/2016.08.15_trinus6038_kbolpo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p><b><i>3. Anti-bacterial property that keeps water clean</i></b></p>
<p>Cut flowers can wilt very quickly if the water they stand in isn't changed. Even though the flowers have been cut and arranged, they will still take in water and are damaged by the bacteria that breed in it. If certain bacteria enter the cut stems, the flowers may be unable to draw water smoothly. That's why PLANT'S JEWEL utilizes an advanced antibacterial coating to keep flowers fresh.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>How it works</h3>
<p>Developed by Kobe Steel, Ltd., KENIFINE™ is a high-performance antibacterial electroplating technology that is 10 times more effective at controlling microorganism growth than conventional anti-microbial products. Simply putting it in a vase limits the growth of bacteria, keeping the water clean, which in turn helps flowers absorb water more easily.</p>

<p>The PLANT’S JEWEL line features four different designs to suit a range of different styles and designs.</p>
<p><b><i>1. Bubble</i></b></p>
<p>The design bears a motif of fizzy bubbles. The piece is placed on a champagne glass or wine glass, and used to support flower stems in its holes. Holes of varied sizes accept stems of differing thicknesses.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b><i>2. Bangle</i></b></p>
<p>The design bears a motif of bangles. The item can be placed on a dish or plate for use without a flower vase. It can also be used inside a large vase in which a small number of flowers would not be supported.</p>
<p>NOTE: As water would quickly evaporate in a dish or plate that is too shallow, a container with some depth is recommended.<br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">SIZE: Height 14.5cm x Width 4cm</span></p>

<p> </p>
<p><b><i>4. Mirror Ball</i></b></p>
<p>The design bears a motif of a mirrored ball. A sphere of 85mm in diameter, the item is used like the kenzan (spiky frog) of ikebana when paired with a container or largish wine glass into which it just fits. Naturally, it can also be used with a single flower or single plant stem.</p>

To realize my business plan, I need to sell enough quantity of my creations. In partnership with you, I will move and develop my project and be able to create gifts for the people, who like to present gifts, who love warm feelings, who love people and who love good memories.Support my project, become my sponsor,Thank you!  Featured RewardsSpecials and limited rewards are offered to you, to be shipped before Christmas, 25% off. Other rewards are available, 20% off. Risks and challengesI guarantee a high quality of my creations. I can ensure the timely delivery of your orders. Being very responsive to any issues that might arise, I guarantee real support to our backers. I will communicate with you and answer any questions. In the case of any unforeseen delay, I will notify backers immediately. In any case, be sure you will receive your order and get proper support. Thank you. [Version Française/French Version]Le fait est que certaines choses changent, les amis, les chemins que nous prenons, les endroits où nous vivons ... mais certaines choses restent, qui ne changent jamais, nos souvenirs, nos sentiments, nos moments partagés ....Les Boules de Lumière sont un symbole chaleureux de partage dans le monde entier.Partout, des gens différents, des âges différents, des cultures différentes mais le même sentiment.Mon nom est Ekaterina Galera, je suis un designer et une créatrice de luminaires en laine feutrée, situé en France.J’ai toujours en envie de transformer la matière première, brute, en un joli objet qui rend notre quotidien plus chaleureux. Pour cette raison et depuis longtemps, j’ai l'habitude de modifier tous mes luminaires. J'ai essayé d'associer beaucoup de matériaux différents, et c'est la laine qui m'a le plus impressionnée. Ce matériau donne un effet très doux et chaleureux à la lumière qui le traverse.J’ai travaillé pendant des jours et des jours pour trouver la forme idéale et la taille idéale. Je me suis inspiré de tous les lieux, de tous les objets, et j’ai essayé et crée de nombreux modèles dans mon atelier. Chaque lumière est conçue et créée dans mon atelier à Toulouse. J'utilise une vieille méthode traditionnelle de feutrage de la laine.J'essaye de préserver un maximum l'aspect naturel et écologique dans mes créations, c'est pourquoi je pratique une méthode traditionnelle de feutrage à la main, utilisant seulement de l'eau et du savon de Marseille. La tonte des moutons étant obligatoire pour leur bien-être, je suis fière de collaborer avec les fermiers, qui vendent la laine.Lorsque la laine est mélangée avec de l'eau et du savon, elle se transforme en une texture très douce et plastique. Ensuite - il est possible de donner libre court à son imagination pour créer toute forme de lampes.Pour moi, le luminaire idéal doit être un objet qui est à la fois ludique et lumineux. Cette décoration doit combiner la laine feutrée naturelle à des sources de lumière chaude et dorée. Cet objet doit pouvoir être enlevé et installé partout où vous voulez. Il peut être sur une table basse, sur une étagère ou même accroché sur un mur ....Et je l'ai trouvé – C’est la Boule de Lumière !C'est un beau cadeau pour soi-même ou pour une personne que l'on aime. Chaud et doux – les Boules de Lumière en laine feutrée peuvent être d'excellentes déclarations de goûts délicats et de nature pacifique. Que ce soit éteint ou allumé, les boules de lumière trouveront leur place aussi bien pour donner un peu de chaleur à tous les espaces de vie, que pour éclairer des événements exceptionnels. Aujourd’hui, je conçois, je produis et je communique moi-même ma marque. Je dois être plus concentrée sur la conception de mes créations. Ainsi, j'ai décidé d'organiser cette campagne. Ces fonds contribueront à accroître la production, et me permettront de déléguer certaines parties du travail à un collaborateur.Pour cela, j’ai besoin de votre aide. Pour réaliser mon objectif, je dois vendre une quantité suffisante de mes créations. En partenariat avec vous, je vais développer mon projet et être en mesure de créer des cadeaux pour les gens, qui aiment offrir des cadeaux, qui aiment les sentiments chaleureux.Soutenez mon projet,Merci !",26.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Wall socket cable cleanup wizard</h3>
<p>We found attaching this product to beside a wall socket very beneficial. We thought about the usage more carefully and we were quite satisfied. This product enables easy and compact organization of multiple cables connected to a wall socket.</p>
<p>Conventionally, we need to pull out the power plug to save the standby power of electronics connected to the outlet, and the cable is left on the ground after disconnecting the plug. Even though it does not intend to save the standby power, the plug is pulled out. If you use this product, the cable can be easily hung after being disconnected from the socket, and the plug can be easily put into the outlet, again. It is very convenient and useful.</p>

<p>It enables easy and safe organization of cables of TV &amp; TV peripherals.<br/>There are too many cables including wires, set-top cables, communication cables and internet lines, etc. They are in a chaotic state or always longer unnecessarily. Therefore there are cable organization issues. And it enables easy and safe organization of cables of PC &amp; PC peripherals.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>It is versatile as a cable organizer as well as a rope roller, storage hanger, and hook, so we believe that consumers will create more uses.</p>
<p>We had guessed that this product would be used in various ways.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545924206/bwnwksl7psl6ohgqmalt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Furthermore, we thought that this product would be good to arrange cables used in greenhouses or strips used for plant cultivation. </p>
<p>This product will be useful to arrange cables of other lamps.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545924415/v3feuj7plvh3qve8gpca.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to its main purposes of cable rolling and bundling, we think it can be transformed into a cable holder by attaching to a desk, bookshelf, wall, etc. or a hanger or hook by attaching to a refrigerator, kitchen wall, etc.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545318238/bhhxrhshjcedgqwojfa9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We also found this product would be very effective to arrange camping tent strips or hang lamps by hanging this product on the tent strips installed. </p>
<p>However, we can't know and understand all things with our experiences and knowledge. </p>

<p>This product, born after 17 years of waiting, looks like a typical item, but a precious one.</p>
<p>Actually, we did not focus on this product area in the past.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have devoted ourselves to developing and distributing an innovative product to save the standby power for the past 17 years. This is what we focus on, an energy saving power strip. We are well known for the specialization in saving the standby power in Korea and around the world. We won the Presidential Award in the Korea Patent Technology Exhibition for 'CHECKTAP,' a smart power strip equipped with software, and the Grand Prix in the International Exhibition of Invention Geneva, for the first time in Asia. We have certified many international electrical safety standards such as CE (Europe), ETL (U.S.), and PSE (Japan) and acquired special certificates such as WHQL (Microsoft) and several international patents. In addition, we won the Technology Grand Award of Hyundai E&amp;C in 2017 for 'wall-mounted automatic standby power block socket.' Recently, we released the 'set-top box standby power KILLER).'</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Looking back into our history, we only stuck with one thing, developing standby power control technologies and distributing products with them to the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To let more people know our energy saving power strip, we exhibit it in about 50 international exhibitions. We exported it to about 20 nations.</p>
<p>For more information on our innovative energy saving products created with our devotions in sweat, blood, and tears, visit <a href=""http://www.checktap.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.checktap.com</a> and <a href=""http://www.eco-brg.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.eco-brg.com</a>.</p>
<p>Search our video clip, “INCASOLUTION” on YouTube. You can see various information on us such as the Grand prix in the International Exhibition of Invention Geneva.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>However, it was not easy to distribute our energy saving - green products.</p>
<p>It was a long and rough journey.</p>
<p>We devoted ourselves, our youth, enthusiasm, time, and money, to create products for 17 years.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While continuing the arduous journey, we focused on and on the development and distribution of energy saving power strips, and paid much persistent attention to general ideas on energy saving and related issues. For example, we had much interest in cable arrangement and thought about related problems and resolutions for a long time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Multiple power cables are connected to a power strip. Thus, it needs to arrange the cables. A power strip itself has a thick and long cable so that it is not easy to arrange it. Our world is full of cables because electric power and communication are essential for our survival and civilization. However, cables are longer than we need. In addition, their length and thickness are different and the use and arrangement of cables of electronics are also different.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘With one small device, let people more easily, neatly, and safely arrange/store/use/carry various small, short, large, or long cables of earphones, chargers, mouses/keyboards, electronics, communication devices, standing signboards, lamps, etc. It looks like a small thing, but very beneficial to the lives of people around the world.’ This proposition was always one of the thoughts in our hearts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>To implement the proposition, we started to develop the item.</p>
<p>However, it is not an easy way to achieve our goal.</p>
<p>We stayed up all night thinking about the item. Even when the dawn is breaking, we concentrated on the development of the item. Lost weight by 10 kg. Fortunately, after the development, gained weight slowly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We were very pleased when we found a clue of an invention.</p>
<p>However, during the product development process that looked like easy, it was hard to have high function and quality and implement good durability. Finally, we completed the development at a price. We did not compromise with knocking items together so that it takes long time to give this product to the world. There is nothing easy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This product is born after severe pains, and we wait for your comments on this product.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have had a tough journey while doing our business for a long time. However, we have continued to conduct research intensely.</p>
<p>We have never gone back against difficulties.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:10.0pt;""> </p>
<p>There is a proverb, heaven helps those who help themselves.</p>
<p>We have a lot of innovative ideas.</p>
<p>We would like to introduce the ideas to you and receive your evaluation in the future.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:10.0pt;""> </p>
<p>We are waiting for your strict evaluation. We gently request your support for our invention to be quickly proliferated in the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We ask for your continuous interest and support so that small companies like us or individuals can continue to bring out creative ideas created from painstaking efforts, resulting in making contributions to the world and people.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Wall socket cable cleanup wizard
We found attaching this product to beside a wall socket very beneficial. We thought about the usage more carefully and we were quite satisfied. This product enables easy and compact organization of multiple cables connected to a wall socket.
Conventionally, we need to pull out the power plug to save the standby power of electronics connected to the outlet, and the cable is left on the ground after disconnecting the plug. Even though it does not intend to save the standby power, the plug is pulled out. If you use this product, the cable can be easily hung after being disconnected from the socket, and the plug can be easily put into the outlet, again. It is very convenient and useful.

3. How to use - Rolling + Bundling
It enables easy and safe organization of cables of TV & TV peripherals.There are too many cables including wires, set-top cables, communication cables and internet lines, etc. They are in a chaotic state or always longer unnecessarily. Therefore there are cable organization issues. And it enables easy and safe organization of cables of PC & PC peripherals.
Organize with gamkki.

Christmas Tree  
gamkki can be used for arranging cables of Christmas trees or super-large trees or light. We make a special video clip. Please, enjoy it.

 
gamkki is applicable to commercial cables for standing signs; agricultural, fishing, and livestock cables for stables and greenhouses; temporary cables for construction and roadwork sites; industrial equipment cables for power tools, solder, and factory equipment; and cables for medical equipment, electric/telecommunication works, and the automotive industry. gamkki can be a good universal promotion gift by printing a campaign on it.

 
It is versatile as a cable organizer as well as a rope roller, storage hanger, and hook, so we believe that consumers will create more uses.
We had guessed that this product would be used in various ways.

 
Furthermore, we thought that this product would be good to arrange cables used in greenhouses or strips used for plant cultivation. 
This product will be useful to arrange cables of other lamps.  

 
In addition to its main purposes of cable rolling and bundling, we think it can be transformed into a cable holder by attaching to a desk, bookshelf, wall, etc. or a hanger or hook by attaching to a refrigerator, kitchen wall, etc.

 
We also found this product would be very effective to arrange camping tent strips or hang lamps by hanging this product on the tent strips installed. 
However, we can't know and understand all things with our experiences and knowledge. 
Please, give us your ideas.  Thank you.                   ljsinfor@naver.com

About Us
Web-site: www.gamkki.com   www.checktap.com    www.eco-brg.com 
 
This product, born after 17 years of waiting, looks like a typical item, but a precious one.
Actually, we did not focus on this product area in the past.
 
We have devoted ourselves to developing and distributing an innovative product to save the standby power for the past 17 years. This is what we focus on, an energy saving power strip. We are well known for the specialization in saving the standby power in Korea and around the world. We won the Presidential Award in the Korea Patent Technology Exhibition for 'CHECKTAP,' a smart power strip equipped with software, and the Grand Prix in the International Exhibition of Invention Geneva, for the first time in Asia. We have certified many international electrical safety standards such as CE (Europe), ETL (U.S.), and PSE (Japan) and acquired special certificates such as WHQL (Microsoft) and several international patents. In addition, we won the Technology Grand Award of Hyundai E&C in 2017 for 'wall-mounted automatic standby power block socket.' Recently, we released the 'set-top box standby power KILLER).'
 
Looking back into our history, we only stuck with one thing, developing standby power control technologies and distributing products with them to the world.
 
To let more people know our energy saving power strip, we exhibit it in about 50 international exhibitions. We exported it to about 20 nations.
For more information on our innovative energy saving products created with our devotions in sweat, blood, and tears, visit www.checktap.com and www.eco-brg.com.
Search our video clip, “INCASOLUTION” on YouTube. You can see various information on us such as the Grand prix in the International Exhibition of Invention Geneva.
 
However, it was not easy to distribute our energy saving - green products.
It was a long and rough journey.
We devoted ourselves, our youth, enthusiasm, time, and money, to create products for 17 years.
 
While continuing the arduous journey, we focused on and on the development and distribution of energy saving power strips, and paid much persistent attention to general ideas on energy saving and related issues. For example, we had much interest in cable arrangement and thought about related problems and resolutions for a long time.
 
Multiple power cables are connected to a power strip. Thus, it needs to arrange the cables. A power strip itself has a thick and long cable so that it is not easy to arrange it. Our world is full of cables because electric power and communication are essential for our survival and civilization. However, cables are longer than we need. In addition, their length and thickness are different and the use and arrangement of cables of electronics are also different.
 
‘With one small device, let people more easily, neatly, and safely arrange/store/use/carry various small, short, large, or long cables of earphones, chargers, mouses/keyboards, electronics, communication devices, standing signboards, lamps, etc. It looks like a small thing, but very beneficial to the lives of people around the world.’ This proposition was always one of the thoughts in our hearts.
 
To implement the proposition, we started to develop the item.
However, it is not an easy way to achieve our goal.
We stayed up all night thinking about the item. Even when the dawn is breaking, we concentrated on the development of the item. Lost weight by 10 kg. Fortunately, after the development, gained weight slowly.
 
We were very pleased when we found a clue of an invention.
However, during the product development process that looked like easy, it was hard to have high function and quality and implement good durability. Finally, we completed the development at a price. We did not compromise with knocking items together so that it takes long time to give this product to the world. There is nothing easy.
 
This product is born after severe pains, and we wait for your comments on this product.
 
We have had a tough journey while doing our business for a long time. However, we have continued to conduct research intensely.
We have never gone back against difficulties.
 
There is a proverb, heaven helps those who help themselves.
We have a lot of innovative ideas.
We would like to introduce the ideas to you and receive your evaluation in the future.
 
We are waiting for your strict evaluation. We gently request your support for our invention to be quickly proliferated in the world.
 
We ask for your continuous interest and support so that small companies like us or individuals can continue to bring out creative ideas created from painstaking efforts, resulting in making contributions to the world and people.
Thank you.

Press Release
""The Bulbh: The ‘Brighter’ LED For A ‘Brighter’ India""  -   GIZMODO
 











BULBH is ultra-portable. Just 35 grams and no bigger than a almond. Literally!

 








 
BULBH is very very bright. For the size, people are amazed by its power.

BULBH is your truly tinkerable light, the no.of uses is only constrained to our thoughts. It's like your go-to light for any of your projects, from a highly efficient solar panel light to a auto-on garden light.










Choose your own combination of body colour and the emitted light temperature colour. BULBH is extremely personal.











What is BULBH?

It’s an extension of you, that integrates with all aspects of your daily life. It's a micro-USB powered light with a cause. Billions of people around the world are without light. Each one deserves something as simple as light. Don't they?For each BULBH sold we donate one. You have the power to give that ray of light.Existing USB lights are very impractical. Almost all we tested had either extremely low brightness or unergonomic design. On the other hand, BULBH is a well-designed and complete product. With its ability to flexibly transform, you can now take BULBH everywhere (bicycle, camps, laptop, windows, walls, anywhere). BULBH will be a part of your everyday life and someone else's.Our design has been inspired from a very popular sweet in India called batasha. The product that has resulted, has been worth all the effort and time we have put into it. This is what we have been waiting for.We wanted to create a device that can withstand the stresses of everyday use, and at the same time is also something that looks and feels really good. 

Why did we choose crowdfunding?
Our aim is to make things that people need. We want to make things which everyone can use. Profit is not the motive, it's a by-product. Not all investors bear the same thought.

To właśnie tutaj zdecydowaliśmy się spełnić nasze marzenie i otworzyć miejsce, dla wszystkich tych, którzy tak jak my kochają rowery. <br/><br/><b>La Republika</b> to miejsce, które powstało z wielkiej pasji, z miłości do wolności, którą daje rower. Nasze miejsce już działa - udało nam się je otworzyć miesiąc temu dzięki kilkumiesięcznej pracy nad lokalem i papierami oraz dzięki wsparciu naszych przyjaciół i naszych rodzin. <br/><br/>Chcemy wykreować miejsce, do którego będzie mógł przyjść każdy - niezależnie od tego jak bardzo i dlaczego kocha rowery. Miejsce otwarte, przyjazne, lokalne. Od samego początku zajmujemy się renowacją starych i zabytkowych rowerów - dążymy do tego, aby pozostawić ich unikatowy charakter, od siebie dodajemy niezbędną funkcjonalność. Pamiętamy o tym, że każdy z tych rowerów ma swoją własną historię - to czego pragniemy to być jej częścią.<br/><br/><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/larepublikabcn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/larepublikabcn</a><br/><br/></i><p></p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact <br/>
</h3> <p></p>We would like to share of what we will get with those kids who need them most. We decided to share 5% of what we will accumulate with foundation which helps orphan children from east Poland. We know some institutions which are focused on sport activities - they know that sports can help them in their difficult situations. Thanks this amount of money we can help finance their needs and we build and buy some bicycles for them. We know how activity is helpful and we will be very proud if we could share the cyclist passion with kids. </div> <div> <h3><i>Oddziaływanie</i></h3>
<p><i>Chcielibyśmy podzielić się uzyskanymi środkami, z tymi, którzy najbardziej ich potrzebują. Postanowiliśmy oddać 5% uzyskanej kwoty na fundację, która<br/>pomaga dzieciom z domu dziecka we wschodniej Polsce. Znamy kilka instytucji, które poprzez rozwój sportowych umiejętności wśród dzieci, widzą<br/>szansę na poprawę jakości ich życia. Dzięki pieniądzom zebranym podczas tej kampanii sfinansujemy ich niezbędne potrzeby oraz sami zrobimy i zakupimy kilka <br/>rowerów. Wiemy jak aktywność fizyczna jest ważna - będziemy bardzo dumni i wzruszeni jeśli uda nam się wśród nich zaszczepić pasję do rowerów. <br/></i></p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Our workshop is already running. We are growing every day but still didn't root enough.<br/><br/>Our biggest challenge is to find our space on a market.<br/><br/>We
 are getting recognisable and we have our first regular customers. This 
is very enjoyable and gives great satisfaction but we know that we can't 
stop here. We have to work hard and constantly, don't break down with 
worse months or failures. Just treat them as adventures, which are 
source of experience and knowledge.<br/><br/>We feel not threatened  by this challenge, most opposite - it gives us strength.<br/><p></p>
<h3><i>Ryzyko i Wyzwania<br/></i></h3>
<i>Nasz lokal jest już otwarty. Zaczynamy się rozwijać, ale wciąż nie zakorzeniliśmy się na dobre.<br/><br/>Nasze największe wyzwanie to znaleźć swoje miejsce na rynku. <br/><br/>Jesteśmy coraz bardziej rozpoznawalni i zaczynamy już mieć swoich pierwszych, stałych klientów. Niezmiernie nas to cieszy i daje olbrzymią satysfakcję, <br/>ale wiemy, że nie możemy się zatrzymywać. Musimy pracować ciężko i wytrwale, nie załamywać się gorszymi miesiącami czy porażkami, traktować je jak przygody,<br/>które są źródłem wiedzy i nauki. <br/><br/>Nie przeraża nas jednak to wyzwanie, a wręcz przeciwnie - daje nam siłę!</i><br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Hello, we are four friends who decided to create a new bike place in Barcelona.Although none of us was born here we treat it like ours. Barcelona became our home, more precisely - Poble Sec area. Here we start the day with friends, here we finish it. And here our dream comes true - we decided to open a magic place for everyone who loves bikes like we do.LA REPUBLIKA is a place that grew from love to bicycles, from need of freedom that they give. Our workshop is already running - we
 opened it month ago, thanks to joint efforts we renovated and rebuilt 
all interiors, set up our work space and we bought small business 
license.We want to create a place for everyone, no matter why and how one loves bikes. Place which is open, friendly, local.We begin with renovating and restoring old and vintage bicycles. During renovation to aim to keep its original character but we don't forget about modern needs and aesthetics. We remember that every singe of our bikes has its own story behind. What we try is just to be part of this story.https://www.facebook.com/larepublikabcn 
Poznaj nas

Witajcie, jesteśmy czworgiem przyjaciół, którzy zdecydowali się otworzyć nowe rowerowe miejsce w Barcelonie. Chociaż nikt z nas się tutaj nie urodził, traktujemy je jak nasze. Od wielu lat mieszkamy w Barcelonie, a dokładniej - na naszej dzielnicy Poble Sec. To właśnie tutaj zdecydowaliśmy się spełnić nasze marzenie i otworzyć miejsce, dla wszystkich tych, którzy tak jak my kochają rowery. La Republika to miejsce, które powstało z wielkiej pasji, z miłości do wolności, którą daje rower. Nasze miejsce już działa - udało nam się je otworzyć miesiąc temu dzięki kilkumiesięcznej pracy nad lokalem i papierami oraz dzięki wsparciu naszych przyjaciół i naszych rodzin. Chcemy wykreować miejsce, do którego będzie mógł przyjść każdy - niezależnie od tego jak bardzo i dlaczego kocha rowery. Miejsce otwarte, przyjazne, lokalne. Od samego początku zajmujemy się renowacją starych i zabytkowych rowerów - dążymy do tego, aby pozostawić ich unikatowy charakter, od siebie dodajemy niezbędną funkcjonalność. Pamiętamy o tym, że każdy z tych rowerów ma swoją własną historię - to czego pragniemy to być jej częścią.https://www.facebook.com/larepublikabcn

    The Impact 
 We would like to share of what we will get with those kids who need them most. We decided to share 5% of what we will accumulate with foundation which helps orphan children from east Poland. We know some institutions which are focused on sport activities - they know that sports can help them in their difficult situations. Thanks this amount of money we can help finance their needs and we build and buy some bicycles for them. We know how activity is helpful and we will be very proud if we could share the cyclist passion with kids.   Oddziaływanie
Chcielibyśmy podzielić się uzyskanymi środkami, z tymi, którzy najbardziej ich potrzebują. Postanowiliśmy oddać 5% uzyskanej kwoty na fundację, którapomaga dzieciom z domu dziecka we wschodniej Polsce. Znamy kilka instytucji, które poprzez rozwój sportowych umiejętności wśród dzieci, widząszansę na poprawę jakości ich życia. Dzięki pieniądzom zebranym podczas tej kampanii sfinansujemy ich niezbędne potrzeby oraz sami zrobimy i zakupimy kilka rowerów. Wiemy jak aktywność fizyczna jest ważna - będziemy bardzo dumni i wzruszeni jeśli uda nam się wśród nich zaszczepić pasję do rowerów. 





Risks & ChallengesOur workshop is already running. We are growing every day but still didn't root enough.Our biggest challenge is to find our space on a market.We
 are getting recognisable and we have our first regular customers. This 
is very enjoyable and gives great satisfaction but we know that we can't 
stop here. We have to work hard and constantly, don't break down with 
worse months or failures. Just treat them as adventures, which are 
source of experience and knowledge.We feel not threatened  by this challenge, most opposite - it gives us strength.
Ryzyko i Wyzwania
Nasz lokal jest już otwarty. Zaczynamy się rozwijać, ale wciąż nie zakorzeniliśmy się na dobre.Nasze największe wyzwanie to znaleźć swoje miejsce na rynku. Jesteśmy coraz bardziej rozpoznawalni i zaczynamy już mieć swoich pierwszych, stałych klientów. Niezmiernie nas to cieszy i daje olbrzymią satysfakcję, ale wiemy, że nie możemy się zatrzymywać. Musimy pracować ciężko i wytrwale, nie załamywać się gorszymi miesiącami czy porażkami, traktować je jak przygody,które są źródłem wiedzy i nauki. Nie przeraża nas jednak to wyzwanie, a wręcz przeciwnie - daje nam siłę!    Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>A bit about me:</h3>
<p>Graduating high school, I worked in my father's construction business for several years, I learned about the fundamentals of foundation, structure, etc.  I then attended Ringling School of Art &amp; Design where I learned the power of color, space and scale. My creativity led me to Los Angeles where I entered the world of set decorating and art direction. This experience wasn't just about being creative, it was about time management, establishing dependable resources, budgeting and orchestrating a crew all in a short amount of time. I learned about Home Staging and how it was impacting the Realestate industry. I redirected myself and was hired as an assistant to a home stager.  My experience quickly moved me up the ladder to a lead designer position. It was in this position where I found my purpose. I was helping people and making a difference. All of the pieces began falling into place and DECOR REVAMP was created.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why a campaign?</h3>
<p>Starting my own business has been exciting, challenging and is apart of ""the American dream""! With that dream, there is the reality that funds are a necessity to start the investment process to begin living that dream. I created my business plan, funded my plan through my savings and hit the ground running.  DECOR REVAMP has been growing steadily over the past 2 years is now my home staging division is gaining momentum at a pretty rapid rate. Its growth is a result of providing a great, affordable service and by ""word of mouth"". It is so exhilarating to get a call and hear, ""I saw your work and it is amazing! I have a project for you."" And, I haven't had to do any advertising. The service is selling itself! A fundraiser is a wonderful platform to get any business across that bridge to a business loan.  Your $1, $5, $50+ contribution will lead me and my team into our next phase which is about becoming incorporated, office and warehouse space, a down payment on a moving truck. There is quite a list and we are getting there but, your help across this bridge will open so many doors and I thank you immensely!                    </p>

The earth is the classic element that represents determination, certainty and physical power. Plato represented it with the hexahedron. Its colours are yellow, orange and brown. For the earth we have chosen an amazing antique brass finish we associate with the hues of the plain.  </p><p>FIRE: Brass with antique Copper finish. Fire is a classic element that represents energy and optimism, and is considered the most powerful of the elements, present in all the great religions and in alchemy and astrology. Orange, red and violet are its colours. The tetrahedron was the figure Plato used to represent it. The antique copper finish resembles the billowing flames of a bonfire.  </p><p>AIR: Titanium Brass finish. Air is intangible and is associated with thinking, intelligence, mental quickness and creativity. It perfectly symbolizes the scientist, the genius and the idealist. Plato related it to the octahedron and its colours are grey and white. For air we have chosen this attractive titanium finish to capture the lightness, hardness and sophistication of this element.  </p><p>UNIVERSE: Brass with rough crome and black finish. Meteor. The Universe is difficult to explain or measure. The whole, infinity, and the mystery of the unknown makes it something magical and unique, as beautiful as unattainable. Planets, stars and black holes make us dream of a fantasy world. Plato chose the dodecahedron to represent it .Inspired by the cosmos, we have given it an amazing rough finish in silver and black.  </p><p>WATER: BRASS with oxide greenish blue finish.

We are back!  We love what we do and your ideas are our motivation, so we are back to take Platonics to the next level. Our Platonic adventure continues!  We want to continue sharing this experience with the world. If you are new to Platonics, join us and share the magic of geometry! Hundreds of them have been distributed all over the world!  Thank you all from the bottom of our hearts, you are the best!30 seconds of your time could make the difference in building the Platonics community. Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend who wants to feel the power of the Elements!The world we live in is moving too fast and sometimes we forget that the simplest experiences are the most authentic and beautiful. That is why we are committed to the value of handmade and unique pieces, combining the oldest techniques and a passion for detail.  We invite you to feel a simple but unforgettable experience with our single cast solids of pure metal.We believe that Platonics is more than just geometry. It is science, art, inspiration, a pure and real experience.  Feel what it is to hold 2,500 years of history in the palm of your hand!Discover what makes our solids unique. You can learn more about our finished metals and processes.Remember that every Platonic is unique, made entirely by hand and individually just for you, using one of the most ancient techniques: smelting. We believe in the preservation of craftsmanship as a key to the enrichment of our society.  Each piece is unique, cast and polished one by one manually, putting maximum attention to detail for it to be perfect.QUALITY MANUFACTURING AND PROCESSING.We work with one of the most ancient techniques, smelting. All our solids are cast in the traditional way using high-quality brass and bronze cast at over 900 degrees, then shaped and individually hand polished.  Each figure is meticulously checked to verify its quality. Each piece is unique. We value quality work and an interest in details. In addition, each polyhedron or set has a serial number.Thanks to Platonics you can enjoy a piece of History, from a single figure to a complete set. Two Collections: Classics and Elements. Available in 3 different sizes and 13 finishes.Plato associated each polyhedron with an element: air, earth, water, fire and the universe. The new edition of Elements will not only offer new finishes, but also each solid has the symbol of its Element engraved.  To represent each of the elements we have designed an elegant symbol that matches the pure and timeless design of our platonic solids.EARTH: Antique Brass finish. The earth is the classic element that represents determination, certainty and physical power. Plato represented it with the hexahedron. Its colours are yellow, orange and brown. For the earth we have chosen an amazing antique brass finish we associate with the hues of the plain.  FIRE: Brass with antique Copper finish. Fire is a classic element that represents energy and optimism, and is considered the most powerful of the elements, present in all the great religions and in alchemy and astrology. Orange, red and violet are its colours. The tetrahedron was the figure Plato used to represent it. The antique copper finish resembles the billowing flames of a bonfire.  AIR: Titanium Brass finish. Air is intangible and is associated with thinking, intelligence, mental quickness and creativity. It perfectly symbolizes the scientist, the genius and the idealist. Plato related it to the octahedron and its colours are grey and white. For air we have chosen this attractive titanium finish to capture the lightness, hardness and sophistication of this element.  UNIVERSE: Brass with rough crome and black finish. Meteor. The Universe is difficult to explain or measure. The whole, infinity, and the mystery of the unknown makes it something magical and unique, as beautiful as unattainable. Planets, stars and black holes make us dream of a fantasy world. Plato chose the dodecahedron to represent it .Inspired by the cosmos, we have given it an amazing rough finish in silver and black.  WATER: BRASS with oxide greenish blue finish. Plato associated water with the icosahedron. Of the four elements, water is considered the most relaxing. It represents cleanliness and purity and symbolizes emotional life. Plato represented water with the icosahedron; Its colours are blue and green. We have chosen this fantastic turquoise tone to represent the oxidation of metal.  We have also created three amazing finishes especially for Indiegogo: Mirror Chrome Brass, Metallic Blue Brass and Steell Brass.The classics are our hallmark. Their beauty and purity makes them special and unique. Unlike new ""Elements"", our classics have no engraving. In addition, after being polished they are protected with a type of wax that eventually darkens resulting in a beautiful patina.All our solids are available in 3 sizes: Mini, Big and Mega.*There may be slight variations in size and weight due to the crafting process.

<h2>Introducing OnSleep: The World’s First Smart Therapeutic Pillow</h2>
<p>You’re not alone if you aren’t happy with your posture. </p>
<p>Sitting hunched over for hours using our computers &amp; phones, causing a very unnatural position for the human body. Then, not getting the support your neck needs using standard pillows that push our head forward for hours during slumber. </p>
<p>That’s why OnSleep is here, introducing to you the world’s first smart therapeutic pillow that’s designed with your posture, comfort, and life of ease in mind! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544128486/k5psa5fvtzxqx2eadp8z.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The OnSleep Pillow is a prime therapeutic pillow that helps restore your natural neck curvature and gently distributes pressure from your thoracic spine precisely. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544128623/zlg43dkuxvffidvhkzp1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Posture pillows are well known in the medical community, where they’ve been used to naturally relieve neck pain for decades. However, what we have done is truly something special, by introducing Smart Lighting and Smart Speakers into our pillow we have revolutionized the pillow. To that end, we are working on making it accessible to everyone. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544128649/cec3yokwnvo0s9m72zlm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>How Does it Work? </h2>
<p>Here’s how OnSleep’s patent pending design helps improve your quality of life. </p>
<p><strong>Engineered perfect neck contour.</strong> Providing proper neck positioning, maintaining the natural curve of your neck. The unique design cradles your head while you sleep on your back, increasing restorative REM sleep and enabling a deeper sleep. </p>
<p><strong>The problem: </strong>Ordinary pillows just aren’t working. Your spine and head are pushed forward, leaving you in a fixed slouching position for more than 8 hours on average.  </p>

<p><strong>Elevated and curved surface for side sleepers.</strong> This boosted extra height for your pillow is great for side sleepers and snorers, elevating the pillow just right allows you to sleep in a natural state keeping your spine aligned. The implemented curved surface allows comfortable sleep without the unwanted ear pressure. With 2 different raised areas this pillow is perfect for just about anyone.  </p>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong> Here’s why your pillow isn’t helping. While sleeping your neck just isn’t aligned properly to your body using your typical pillow, leaving your head and neck either too high or too low. This causes extreme stress on your body, pinching and irritating nerves. </p>
<p><strong>The solution:</strong> With OnSleep’s proper elevation your muscles can relax, keeping your nerves unpinched. Wake up feeling like a truly new version of yourself. </p>

<p><strong>Serotonin, melatonin, and cortisol levels.</strong> Studies have been shown that therapeutic pillows increase serotonin and melatonin levels, reducing stress and anxiety.

</div></div>","Introducing OnSleep: The World’s First Smart Therapeutic Pillow
You’re not alone if you aren’t happy with your posture. 
Sitting hunched over for hours using our computers & phones, causing a very unnatural position for the human body. Then, not getting the support your neck needs using standard pillows that push our head forward for hours during slumber. 
That’s why OnSleep is here, introducing to you the world’s first smart therapeutic pillow that’s designed with your posture, comfort, and life of ease in mind! 

The OnSleep Pillow is a prime therapeutic pillow that helps restore your natural neck curvature and gently distributes pressure from your thoracic spine precisely. 

Posture pillows are well known in the medical community, where they’ve been used to naturally relieve neck pain for decades. However, what we have done is truly something special, by introducing Smart Lighting and Smart Speakers into our pillow we have revolutionized the pillow. To that end, we are working on making it accessible to everyone. 

How Does it Work? 
Here’s how OnSleep’s patent pending design helps improve your quality of life. 
Engineered perfect neck contour. Providing proper neck positioning, maintaining the natural curve of your neck. The unique design cradles your head while you sleep on your back, increasing restorative REM sleep and enabling a deeper sleep. 
The problem: Ordinary pillows just aren’t working. Your spine and head are pushed forward, leaving you in a fixed slouching position for more than 8 hours on average.  
The solution: But here’s good news, OnSleep restores your natural neck curvature (cervical spine) while also supporting your head, and upper thoracic spine perfectly. Get rid of unwanted neck pain. 

Elevated and curved surface for side sleepers. This boosted extra height for your pillow is great for side sleepers and snorers, elevating the pillow just right allows you to sleep in a natural state keeping your spine aligned. The implemented curved surface allows comfortable sleep without the unwanted ear pressure. With 2 different raised areas this pillow is perfect for just about anyone.  
The problem: Here’s why your pillow isn’t helping. While sleeping your neck just isn’t aligned properly to your body using your typical pillow, leaving your head and neck either too high or too low. This causes extreme stress on your body, pinching and irritating nerves. 
The solution: With OnSleep’s proper elevation your muscles can relax, keeping your nerves unpinched. Wake up feeling like a truly new version of yourself. 

Serotonin, melatonin, and cortisol levels. Studies have been shown that therapeutic pillows increase serotonin and melatonin levels, reducing stress and anxiety. While also decreasing cortisol levels, improving your mood and boosting restful deep sleep at the same time. Relax your muscles and wake up feeling refreshed, ready to take on the day. 
This results in a reduced cortisol level and an increase in serotonin production, meaning it helps decreases your blood pressure and heart rate. 

Type of construction. Unlike other ordinary pillows that go flat and lose shape, OnSleep® uses non-allergenic, non-toxic memory foam (50d medium density) so it remains very supportive and comfortable all night. Never again fluff up or readjust, don’t let your head sink or shift during slumber. While being breathable so you don’t sleep hot. 

Advanced pillow shape: Get the support you need! With our one of a kind One Size Fits all design. Ranging from 6'5 all the way to 4'9 support.

<h3><b>Residential
Locks are Easy to Defeat</b></h3>
<b>
</b><p><span>LOKmate is specially designed to
protect your home, apartment or even hotel room from unwanted intruders when
you or your family is present.  It's shocking how easy it is for someone
to unlock a front door deadbolt lock and gain entry while you or your loved
ones are sleeping.  

</span></p>
<p><span>LOKmate makes a great <i>childproofing</i>
device as well.  Small children learn quickly how to open the front door
by twisting the deadbolt knob while parents grapple with ways keep little ones <i>inside</i>. 
</span></p>
<p><span>In many multi-unit buildings spare keys
abound.  Strangers can gain entry by using a duplicate key left from a
previous owner/tenant or a bump key, a specially crafted universal key that can
defeat 95% of residential deadbolts. Bump keys are widely available due to
numerous online vendors and new 3D printing techniques.  Breaking into
apartments and homes has never been easier.  And the same thing can happen
when you travel.  Indeed, many apartments and multi-unit residential
complexes are are equipped with inexpensive deadbolts that are easy victims to
bump keys used by locksmiths, law enforcement and criminals. </span></p>

You'd be surprised
how many potentially disastrous home invasions can be thwarted just by using a
simple device like LOKmate.  Bureau of Justice Statistics Special Report
states that a household member was home in approximately 28 percent of
burglaries.  Alarmingly, a household member suffered some form of violence
in seven percent of burglaries.  If you ever wondered what the chances are
that an intruder will find his way into your home, the fact is, the United
States <i>leads the world in occurrence of burglaries</i> and about four
burglaries occur every minute; that’s one every fifteen seconds, and many occur
with doors properly equipped with double locking mechanisms.  These
statistics have been compiled from FBI reports as well as, the National Fire
Protection Association and the Alarm Industry Research &amp; Educational
Foundation.  
<div>
<p>
</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3><b>The
LOKmate Solution</b></h3>
<p>LOKmate was developed by a team of specialists knowledgeable
in product design and security systems, including an Iraq war veteran with
expertise overcoming security systems and locks.  Following two years of
laborious testing on most common deadbolt mechanisms, the current universal
design was adopted.  Over this time prototypes were provided to dozens of
willing testers in various environments and the response was fantastic.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455916913/ejrn7xgycj3hislethak.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><i><b></b></i></p>
<h3><b>LOKmate Installs and
Uninstalls in Seconds</b></h3>
<h3><b>(No Hardware Necessary)  </b></h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>LOKmate works by preventing the
deadbolt's twist knob from being turned.  The patent pending universal
design fits almost any single-cylinder deadbolt lock configuration regardless
of its knob orientation (twist knob left, right, center or angled). As long as
the lock works with a twist knob, then LOKmate will work perfectly. </p>
<p>It snaps easily onto most standard home
deadbolt locks to prevent breaking, picking or otherwise tampering with the
deadbolt. It even will <i>stop unexpected entry by people with additional keys</i>,
like a landlord, maintenance person or previous tenant!  You can use it at
home or on the go.  Keep pesky hotel staff from entering your room while
you're asleep.  Keep the little ones home safe even when you're not
looking.  While unlocking LOKmate is very easy, it's difficult for young
children to operate the spring-loaded locking mechanism and protective flange. </p>
<h3>Ready For the Market<br/>
</h3>
<p>LOKmate is now ready for market and 
will be available in a variety of color combinations to suit most home 
décor.  This first model will be available in <b>five styles</b>: (1) All 
black; (2) black body with stainless steel or brass hardware, and: (3) 
white body with stainless or brass hardware.</p>
<p></p>
</div>
<h3><b>Allocation
of Funds</b></h3>
<p>Funding will make it possible to go to full production with
an updated final design so we can begin selling through major retail
channels.  A large portion of funding (approximately 60%) will go to new
tooling and materials for commercial production.  Another 10% for
commercial packaging.<br/>
<br/>
The remaining 30% of funds will be used to establish a full-time operation,
build an e-commerce site, and hire our team who have contributed their time
generously to this project until now.  It is our hope that eventually
LOKmate will be widely available in major hardware and home retailers.</p><h3>
<b>Contributor
Perks</b>
</h3><div><div>
<p>Depending on the perk
level, contributors will receive one or more LOKmates in the color combination
of their choice.  The more you contribute, the more you save so think
about ordering volume perks to give to family and friends.  Each order
includes a wall-mounted color coordinated holder (black for black units and
white for white units) so you can store your LOKmates near the lock when not in
use.  As a bonus for this campaign we will include a handy travel pouch so
you can take your LOKmate with you wherever you go.<br/>

<li>
<strong>RECYCLABLE GOODNESS.</strong> I'm still using recyclable, lightweight, flexible, BPA-free plastic on this round 2 of manufacturing. It is portable and smooth, in 4 lovely muted colors.</li>
<li>
<strong>NON-SLIP INGENUITY.</strong> I've subtly embedded four non-slip rubber bits to the bottom of the potty to prevent slippage on any surface without increasing the weight of the potty too much...so no more spills of pee and poo onto your lap, the floor, the bed, your car, or your baby. (Ask me how I know.)</li>
<li>
<strong>THICKER PLASTIC, REINFORCED HANDLE + BOTTOM. </strong>We've made this potty more resilient, sturdy, and smooth...everywhere.</li>
<li>
<strong>A WARM AND COMFY SEAT.</strong> I'm offering an optional potty cozy (liquid-repellant undyed fleece) to go with your mini potty. Because who likes a cold seat? Not me, my dear. And not your baby, I assure you.</li>

NON-SLIP INGENUITY. I've subtly embedded four non-slip rubber bits to the bottom of the potty to prevent slippage on any surface without increasing the weight of the potty too much...so no more spills of pee and poo onto your lap, the floor, the bed, your car, or your baby. (Ask me how I know.)

THICKER PLASTIC, REINFORCED HANDLE + BOTTOM. We've made this potty more resilient, sturdy, and smooth...everywhere.

A WARM AND COMFY SEAT. I'm offering an optional potty cozy (liquid-repellant undyed fleece) to go with your mini potty. Because who likes a cold seat? Not me, my dear. And not your baby, I assure you.
The potty:The colors:The differences between the new and old models (please note that the NEW model does have the same screenprint in white on the front - this is just the prototype!):What we need to make this a realityI've already purchased a brand new plastics mold for $2500, done a few sample tests, and placed a full first order for 4,000 potties. They are on their way to my home, as we speak.I estimate shipping out all final products to you by the beginning of July 2020. This time around they are completely done. Now it's just a matter of placing the final payment when they arrive, and shipping them to you and your baby!Manufacturing costs include:
making the mold $2500
second round of manufacturing $5000
manufacture of additional elements $1000
shipping and branding supplies $1000
I am raising funds through pre-orders for the remaining $7000 in costs.But I need your help to make this a reality!Please pre-order your Mini Potty v2.0 today.You can make sure everyone has long-term access to this ECing gem - which is integral to successfully potty a young baby and helping our young toddlers be potty independent - by backing this campaign and pre-ordering your Mini Potty v2.0 today.This potty helps the world by:
reducing the barriers to completing EC and potty training for parents worldwide (these potties make completion *so much* easier)
reducing diaper waste (ECed babies typically use less than 1/2 the diapers of non-ECed babies)
helping parents seal the deal because they now have the right tools (no more tantrums!).
Here are some of the Perks I'm offering:
The Mini Potty 2.0 with or without an undyed fleece potty cozy
2-pack and 4-pack options
wholesale packs
and, of course, some educational content!
Check out all the perks on this page and pre-order your potty - by purchasing a perk - today!Other ways you can helpNo matter what perk you choose, it would mean the world to me if you could please SHARE this campaign with your mama groups, your social networks, and your pals...it's only up for 7 days.Thank you so much for your ongoing support and happy pottying!xxGo Diaper Free, Tiny Undies, and DiaperFreeBabyPatent and trademark pending.",10.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">It's YOUR Data. Own It!</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">First things first, we're looking for a crowd, not simply crowd-funding.  Join us and other concerned parents, professionals, and friends in ending on-line abuses. Recover your data. Restore your privacy. Reclaim your data ownership rights. Some laws have recently changed to support your digital ownership rights and more are coming.

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Secondly, FamOrg+ needs your input to guide the future development of this first-of-its-kind platform as technologies emerge that enable you to recover and maintain new-found control over you and your family's private information.  </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">For less than a fancy cup of coffee, become early adopters of this new and exciting platform and collaborators in the evolution of  FamOrg+ and its future. EXACTA's architects have been technology and thought leaders on data security since the 1980s  predicting the rise of cyber terrorism and the rejection of security precautions except in knee-jerk response to breaches and hacks.</p>

<p>Unlike other personal organizing apps that don't integrate well, exclude robust security, and offer relatively few features for free, you won't get bombarded with ads upon ads, charged fees to remove these annoyances, or to purchase add-ons.  Our business model for FamOrg+ is based on security, integrity, and the platform's value in ending the plague of data breaches, namely central data warehouses controlled by third-parties.  Thus, our mantra, ""It's YOUR Data.  Own It!""</p>
<p>Affordably priced far below existing products based on old technologies that have not prevented breaches, FamOrg+ is the first platform designed from the start around a wireless world on 5G and blockchain technology to give you the ability to actually possess and control all of the digital information you are entitled to own. </p>
<p>Keep your private data private. Share only with those you know and trust.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609265751/argfiniqze60zsesjjfy.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> FamOrg+ is the first consumer solution that truly empowers and ensures individual privacy by design.  Discarding obsolete communication protocols from World War II used across the  Internet today, new network appliances are coming to market with unprecedented security that should have always been there.</p>
<p>Here are just a sample of microservices available in FamOrg+:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trusted relationships with relatives, friends, and providers, like teachers, accountants, lawyers, and healthcare workers.<br/> </li>
<li>Communications that are not monitored and recorded by third-parties, collected, analyzed, and sold to yet other parties.<br/> </li>
<li>Personal and important records, like estate plans, bills, long term warranties, and precious photos, stored decentrally in the cloud and out of the hands of unintended, unauthorized, or unscrupulous people, as well as beyond the reach of fire and water damage.<br/> </li>
<li>Password-free access that authenticates and authorizes your individual and family's access to important online services where trusted providers can store your records (which you own) in your personal and private data warehouse.<br/> </li>
<li>Restoration of good parenting, no longer disenfranchised by modern technology, enabling early intervention on social media abuse, related depression, and feelings of isolation that can lead to tragic consequences.<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The primary risk is in failing to recognize emerging technologies that change everything, namely worldwide wireless 5G/6G networks and blockchain storage.  But the risk of recognizing and not changing is even greater if there isn't a tool to benefit every person. </p>
<ul>
<li>With private sector and government software and systems security experience for nearly 40 years, EXACTA's team of developers have a unique skillset in mission-critical application development of industrial-strength banking, insurance, and automation applications.<br/> </li>
<li>With a view of new laws and emerging technologies through lenses ground for nearly 50 years, EXACTA is a leader in creating solutions that are future-proof or sufficiently adaptable to changing needs.<br/> </li>
<li>5G is rolling out and blockchain software development is relatively low-code.  Applying the technology with no other leaders in the field offers EXACTA and our community to establish standards going forward with the strong support of new and emerging laws built on your individual rights of privacy and data ownership, like HIPPA, GDPR, and CCPA.<br/> </li>
<li>Family Organizer Plus [FamOrg+] offers you the ""missing link"" platform that instills the actual data owner with the ability to possess and control one's personal information everywhere, all the time. <br/> </li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>Get the movement moving!  Share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter,  LinkedIn, and other social platforms with your friends, family, and worldwide connections.<br/> </li>
<li>Use #familyorganizerplus, #famorg+, #blockchain, #5G, #crowdfunding and other tags, too.<br/> </li>

For less than a fancy cup of coffee, become early adopters of this new and exciting platform and collaborators in the evolution of  FamOrg+ and its future. EXACTA's architects have been technology and thought leaders on data security since the 1980s  predicting the rise of cyber terrorism and the rejection of security precautions except in knee-jerk response to breaches and hacks.
Click on this image to obtain our position paper on the implications of new technologies and laws on your data privacy and ownership rights.

Unlike other personal organizing apps that don't integrate well, exclude robust security, and offer relatively few features for free, you won't get bombarded with ads upon ads, charged fees to remove these annoyances, or to purchase add-ons.  Our business model for FamOrg+ is based on security, integrity, and the platform's value in ending the plague of data breaches, namely central data warehouses controlled by third-parties.  Thus, our mantra, ""It's YOUR Data.  Own It!""
Affordably priced far below existing products based on old technologies that have not prevented breaches, FamOrg+ is the first platform designed from the start around a wireless world on 5G and blockchain technology to give you the ability to actually possess and control all of the digital information you are entitled to own. 
Keep your private data private. Share only with those you know and trust. 
 

The Impact
 FamOrg+ is the first consumer solution that truly empowers and ensures individual privacy by design.  Discarding obsolete communication protocols from World War II used across the  Internet today, new network appliances are coming to market with unprecedented security that should have always been there.
Here are just a sample of microservices available in FamOrg+:

Trusted relationships with relatives, friends, and providers, like teachers, accountants, lawyers, and healthcare workers. 
Communications that are not monitored and recorded by third-parties, collected, analyzed, and sold to yet other parties. 
Personal and important records, like estate plans, bills, long term warranties, and precious photos, stored decentrally in the cloud and out of the hands of unintended, unauthorized, or unscrupulous people, as well as beyond the reach of fire and water damage. 
Password-free access that authenticates and authorizes your individual and family's access to important online services where trusted providers can store your records (which you own) in your personal and private data warehouse. 
Restoration of good parenting, no longer disenfranchised by modern technology, enabling early intervention on social media abuse, related depression, and feelings of isolation that can lead to tragic consequences. 


Risks & Challenges
The primary risk is in failing to recognize emerging technologies that change everything, namely worldwide wireless 5G/6G networks and blockchain storage.  But the risk of recognizing and not changing is even greater if there isn't a tool to benefit every person. 

With private sector and government software and systems security experience for nearly 40 years, EXACTA's team of developers have a unique skillset in mission-critical application development of industrial-strength banking, insurance, and automation applications. 
With a view of new laws and emerging technologies through lenses ground for nearly 50 years, EXACTA is a leader in creating solutions that are future-proof or sufficiently adaptable to changing needs. 
5G is rolling out and blockchain software development is relatively low-code.  Applying the technology with no other leaders in the field offers EXACTA and our community to establish standards going forward with the strong support of new and emerging laws built on your individual rights of privacy and data ownership, like HIPPA, GDPR, and CCPA. 
Family Organizer Plus [FamOrg+] offers you the ""missing link"" platform that instills the actual data owner with the ability to possess and control one's personal information everywhere, all the time.

<h2>The Tub Flo Origin Story</h2>
<h3>Our drains were constantly getting blocked and I tried several different hair catchers, but they either looked really ugly or didn’t fit my size drain or required me taking the drain stopper mechanics apart. That's when I thought there must be a more elegant, simple effective solution out there.</h3>
<h3>It took almost a year of prototyping and testing in the bathrooms of all my long haired friends and family until one day a friend staying with me for the weekend said: “ Where did you buy this thing? It's amazing. I want to buy one for my home too”.  That's when I knew the prototype was ready for production.</h3>
<h3>Today I would like to invite everyone with some sense of elegance and style, sharing their home with a long haired species, to support our project by getting yourself a Tub Flo and finally bring this product to life.</h3>

Sometimes, or rather, often times, we wish that somebody, or something, could help us take care of our youngest one such that we can chop the vegetables, go to the restroom or just get some sleep.The BabyRocker is your helping hand in your busy everyday. What is the BabyRocker?A video says more than a thousand words 

 
It works on multiple carriers!

Are you impressed? Please keep scrolling! We believe you will find it interesting! Prototype done!Designed and produced in Denmark. Patent pending.The BabyRocker is entirely designed and manufactured in Denmark. For us, it is important that it is produced using high quality materials, responsible manufacturing, and with minimum environmental impact. Easy to carry and handleThe size of a water bottleThe secret behind BabyRocker's functionality is its weight and how the weight is managed. BabyRocker is approximately the size of a bottle of water (750ml or 25fl oz) and weighs approx. 1 kg (2.2lbs) making it portable and easy to handle. Disclaimer: The dimensions and weight of the final product might deviate from the indicated figures. Safe. Simple. SmartA peek insideSafety is our absolute priority! BabyRocker is powered by 8 AA-size NiMH batteries. We have chosen this solution because modern AA batteries are more environmentally friendly than Li-ion batteries, and more importantly NiMH batteries have NO risk of explosion while being discharged/used. We do not compromise on safety when it comes to our little ones! Simplicity and convenience are invaluable attributes for families with children. We know! Therefore, the BabyRocker is super simple to use. Press the ON/OFF button and the BabyRocker will start comforting your baby. And in the case you forget, BabyRocker will stop automatically after a period of time.Smart. The secret behind BabyRocker unique feature is in its controls.

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who we are?</h3>
<p>Hexpressions started a year ago as a social impact venture to create disruptive change in society through innovative design ideas. We believe that disruptive design ideas can bring a significant revolution in society. We are a passionate team of designers and architects, we understand the market potential, opportunities and threats too. Our past work experience will help us to evaluate the market very well in terms of design requirements and opportunities. Hexpress our latest innovation is not only a project but our duty towards society and our planet too.</p>
<p>Hexpress is all about social virtuousness. We aim towards sustainability through innovative paper honeycomb furniture that is eco-friendly and fully recyclable. The Paper Honeycomb is the latest accepted transformation in the furniture industry as it is minimal, lightweight and flatpack. It is a perfect alternative of heavy, bulky materials like hardwoods or non-biodegradable plastic. We are excited to come up with an idea that serves the environment by reducing the carbon footprint on the planet through sustainable materials.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Give and take</h3>
<p>IT'S THE BEST YOU CAN SUPPORT!</p>
<p>Your support is crucial for us to make this idea successful. Bring in the furniture which is durable yet eco-friendly, uniformly crushing under compression and getting comfortable with time. Made out of paper which has a low overall environmental impact. We are working over to improvise its sophisticated look by printing the aesthetic designs on the Kraft paper which will add a captivating appearance to the furniture. </p>
<p>1. Accordion </p>
<p>The Accordion Stool is a folding stool like a bound book. This incredibly designed 2 kg modular furniture is creative, flexible and trendy. This stool is made of special Kraft paper which is strong and moisture-proof, having magnetic ends supported with ribbons to keep them adhered. Because of the rigid Honeycomb structure, the stool can bear about 300 kg of weight making it insanely strong. The stool backs a minimalistic approach, taking up less space, easy to stack and store, giving your room a sense of clarity and simplicity instead of emptiness. It comes with four color variants which are white, black, red and brown with yellow and white leather, rush and felt cushion.</p>
<p>2. Futon</p>
<p>The Paper Futon has a captivating design of a shell-like honeycomb structure. This 3kg paper furniture has undying flexibility and can be stretched up to 3 meters. Made out of waterproof kraft paper, this modular furniture can be revamped to multiple shapes making it highly convertible. Innovative, ingenious and powerful, it can bear about 300kgs of weight with ease. This functional furniture created by geometrical honeycomb shape is minimal and is enough to make you swoon.</p>
<p>Make your home not only more calming but also more appealing and experience purity and elegance with minimalism. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Bring home Hexpress and promise sustainability and minimalism this festive season, to enlighten the souls of every individual and imbibing the impact of conservatism. With you backing us by contributing our project, we will be able to represent the furniture industry the zero-waste production methods. We need your support to outspread our objectives and vision for the betterment of the earth and the human race. Be a part of the world that is sin-free, and let's create a sustainable world together.</p>
<p>What is PAPER HONEYCOMB?</p>
<p>Paper honeycomb has top-notch characteristics because of its unique form of hexagonal shaped cells. This nature-inspired hexagonal geometrical structure provides a new horizon for community seating. It’s light while providing maximum support, through the combination of superior strength and rigidity because of its unique form of hexagonal shaped cells. It offers a wide range of flexible creative solutions for many industries like construction, automotive and household appliances. Inspired by trees and bees, the honeycomb is an alternative for packaging and product design as it is one of the most strong shapes and bees know this.</p>
<p>Fast Assembly</p>
<p>The PaperHoneycomb structures have the geometry of a honeycomb which minimizes the material used to reach minimal weight and maximum strength. The furniture becomes soft and comfortable to sit because of the continuous honeycomb alignment. We provide ready to assemble fast &amp; modular furniture that will take shape in no time. No Handling tools, No guide manual, and No video tutorials needed to assemble.</p>
<p>Sustainability</p>
<p>We are the premier source of minimal and sustainable interiors for your homes and offices. We are utilizing a harmonized approach to Streamlining Sustainability. The paper made furniture is completely recyclable and even can be reused, so, whenever you want to discard it, you can dispose of it in recycling bins. No carbon footprints. We are sustainable and do not consider the process of burning fossils. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>

More energy supplied will be used just once which is not that effective 

More people shall stay unemployed, ill, hungry. 

The economy's growth will be lower /than it could be/


The ""criticists"" will make less money etc.

Here is our plan in three steps:

Start produce and sale at any cost /we negotiate with mighty local private ""angels"" too but, they are so greedy, having tradition in innovation so they're  inactive for now/
Develop the product line /actually, a generation of some expanding modules and even co-systems based on the economizer is already patent pending in EU-country/ 

Go straight ahead.



  Other Ways You Can Help
- Let me think...
When we start, we will need more: 

Legal assistance, contacts, knowledge, 

Logistics in the countries we supply the products,
 Organizing users communities for sharing experience and feedback for it's behaviour etc.

•Federico Cavazza - I'm a designer with a very heterogeneous background. I’ve worked on urban, automotive and interior design projects before finding my way in the lighting design field.
•Andrea Poggiali - I’m a product designer attracted by art. I’m specialized in the creation of 3D models and in the design of fake stone furniture. I am a creative person, very passionate about history and sports.
• We began working on MoonLight project two years ago. We really felt in love with our project, so last year we made a sample (with a $5000 budget) that only reflected the functionality of MoonLight, leaving the aesthetic part aside.
•MoonLight is not just an ordinary lamp. We strongly believe that it should be produced, because with its simple yet innovative design it can improve your everyday life. 
•The production and commercialization of MoonLight would be a great opportunity for us to make ourselves known in the industry as lighting designers. 




The Project
The basic idea was to build a table lamp composed by cubic shaped modules which if detached from the main module emitted their own light thanks to an internal battery.
However, aesthetically, the complete blockade resulted in an unattractive monolithic form, so the single cubic forms have been transformed into spherical ones that are more ergonomic and aesthetically pleasant.
We have modified the grouping too: it was no longer possible to create a single base cube as the balls would have damage the mating faces and aesthetics.
The cube from the family has become a cluster that contains all the required modules.
They have been placed on a plane and hanging at different heights. That allows a play of light and custom arrangements.
The cluster re-groups the individual balls hanging through the convergence of electric cables in one place, thanks to the use of a guide / sheath.
To contain the balls and ensure an attack to the electrical network, we have created a structure of the form to the goblet which slenderness and sinuosity allows to have a composition that maintains any form perfectly bright.
The functionality of the structure also allows the utilization of the spheres as independent from the main basis. The independent functionality of the spheres is ensured by the addition of a disc as a pyramidal support base (flut). 
Every single module of MoonLight can be transported thanks to a low power consumption internal battery. The spheres emit light without emission of heat (due to the use of LEDs) and have been equipped with a 9-Volt Battery 600 mAh which yield is about 3 hours.
MoonLight can be used as an emergency lamp too, since the spheres’s light is not connected to electric energy.

<p>The SliceX <b>trough lines up items of different sizes</b> so that they can all be cut right down the middle with one cut.</p>
<p>The SliceX <b>backstop holds items in place</b> as you cut across right through them in one motion.</p>
<p>The SliceX <b>knife guide ensures a straight cut</b> right down the middle.</p>
<p>Each SliceX offers <b>four slicing troughs</b> upon rotation.</p>
<p>SliceX's <b>two part design makes it easy to clean and to store</b>.</p>
<p>Heavy duty HDPE plastic supports <b>years of use</b>.</p>
<p>SliceX makes <b>slicing food much safer </b>because your fingers don't need to hold the items you are cutting.</p>
<p><b>Why bother slicing your fruit and vegetables anyway?</b></p>
<p>Slicing cherry tomatoes makes them a lot easier to eat rather than chasing them around your plate with a fork until you finally spear one and it spurts juice onto your shirt.  Besides being a more elegant way to serve cherry tomatoes, slicing them in half releases their flavor and juices into your salad dressing, pasta sauce, etc.  Grapes are also much easier to eat when cut in half. Slicing them releases their flavor into your chicken salad, fruit salad, etc. </p>

<p>Children's Food Safety Note: Grapes can be a choking hazard.  Sliced grapes are much safer to eat, especially for children.  Same goes for blueberries and hot dogs.  Food safety experts recommend cutting hot dogs and sausages lengthwise, particularly for children, and SliceX makes that a breeze, especially when they are hot to the touch.  SliceX makes a perfect baby shower gift.</p>
<p><b>SliceX Goes Both Ways:  </b></p>
<p>You can slice toward or away from the backstop and knife guide groove. Try both ways and choose the method that is most comfortable to you.</p>

</div></div>","SliceX - The most versatile food slicing tool since the knife and cutting board.Slicing fruits and vegetables ought to be faster, safer and more fun...so we created SliceX.Slice multiple cherry tomatoes, grapes, olives, brussels sprouts, even blueberries... in one easy motion. Make several orange, apple, grapefruit, even mushroom wedges at one time. Going from quarters to eighths has never been easier.It's also handy for chopping things like seeds and nuts that tend to fly off traditional cutting boards.
Novel 3D cutting surface automatically aligns, supports and holds food still for greater slicing efficiency, safety, and ease.
As Seen On



 

With SliceX you don't have to pick up individual items off your cutting board. Just pour the sliced items right into your bowl from the SliceX.

SliceX is durable and washable.  It is made out of the same recyclable material as professional grade cutting boards, and it is easy on your knife blades.
 

 

SliceX comes apart into two pieces for easy storage.
 

Buy your SliceX and very soon you'll be looking for reasons to use it and to feel the satisfaction of easily slicing numerous items at once.

The SliceX trough lines up items of different sizes so that they can all be cut right down the middle with one cut.
The SliceX backstop holds items in place as you cut across right through them in one motion.
The SliceX knife guide ensures a straight cut right down the middle.
Each SliceX offers four slicing troughs upon rotation.
SliceX's two part design makes it easy to clean and to store.
Heavy duty HDPE plastic supports years of use.
SliceX makes slicing food much safer because your fingers don't need to hold the items you are cutting.
Why bother slicing your fruit and vegetables anyway?
Slicing cherry tomatoes makes them a lot easier to eat rather than chasing them around your plate with a fork until you finally spear one and it spurts juice onto your shirt.  Besides being a more elegant way to serve cherry tomatoes, slicing them in half releases their flavor and juices into your salad dressing, pasta sauce, etc.  Grapes are also much easier to eat when cut in half. Slicing them releases their flavor into your chicken salad, fruit salad, etc. 

Children's Food Safety Note: Grapes can be a choking hazard.  Sliced grapes are much safer to eat, especially for children.  Same goes for blueberries and hot dogs.  Food safety experts recommend cutting hot dogs and sausages lengthwise, particularly for children, and SliceX makes that a breeze, especially when they are hot to the touch.  SliceX makes a perfect baby shower gift.
SliceX Goes Both Ways:  
You can slice toward or away from the backstop and knife guide groove. Try both ways and choose the method that is most comfortable to you.

</div><h3>Reduce The Cost of Gas And Improve The Environment!</h3><p>We'd all like to do something about the cost of gas, and we'd all like to use our resources more efficiently. And if we could cut down pollutants and reduce dependence on foreign oil in the process, so much the better. Well, we at StewardTech believe we may have found a way to help do all of these things. And you are invited to join us in the process of bringing this dream to life.</p><p>We have a unique design (Patent Pending) for a turbine that we believe could replace piston engines in everything from lawnmowers to locomotives. And we believe these turbines will be more efficient, lower maintenance, easier to produce and more durable than their internal combustion counterparts. We think this idea has the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry, and this is your chance to be a proud part of the revolution.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470062767/FullTurbine_yojyd4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h3>The Impact</h3><ul>
<li>Your contribution helps advance technology, while helping the environment. The high efficiency turbine will use less gasoline than an equivalent piston engine. </li>
<li>It costs less to build than a comparable piston engine, and has fewer moving parts, so there's less to break down. You make things cheaper, cleaner and more reliable. That's a pretty big win for everyone.</li>
<li>By helping people use less gas, you also take away dependence on foreign oil. By doing this, in many cases, you take money away from terrorists. </li>
<li>Your contribution will help create jobs. Maybe a few; hopefully a lot.</li>
<li>You help create something really new that has the potential to make life better for a lot of people. That's a good legacy to have.</li>
</ul><h3>About The Company</h3><p>In many ways, StewardTech is a different kind of company. It's a company founded with its primary goal of creating a legacy. One of the things that we will be doing is instead of paying out dividends, when we meet our operational needs, any profits will be used to support charities and social programs that are important to us. Programs like food banks, family crisis centers and missions, first in our own communities, then hopefully reaching out nationally and even internationally. </p><p>Another difference in StewardTech is that we want to be so much more than just a place to build a career. We want to be a place where we help our people to build rewarding lives, both inside and outside the company. Toward that end, we want work to be as much an experience in corporate worship as it is in producing products. We believe that if we invite God into our work lives, that helps us make better products, and makes us a better company. It also helps us make better decisions along the way. We also want to create an environment of family. We firmly believe we were put here to serve one another, and to help one another along the road of life. Our unity is one of our greatest strengths.</p><p>We want to build products that make life better. We want our products to use resources more wisely, both in the production of the product, and in its lifetime. We want to create for you not just products that do the job, but that do the job better with less waste along the way.</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>Let's be honest here: we're just getting started, so what we need is basically everything. Hardware, software, facilities, you name it. And this venture is not without risk. But we believe the basic design is solid, and we think the potential value of our product far outweighs the risk. We think this turbine is a real winner, and when it goes into wide production, it will make people's lives better by reducing their fuel usage, and creating less pollution in the process.</li>
<li>The most important perk is not on our list. The most important perk is the knowledge that you worked to make life a little better for yourself, your children and your fellow man. Isn't that what makes life worthwhile? But do take a look at the perks offered. Some of them are quite valuable (a turbine-powered sports car, for example). But if you add up the total contributions that can be made, every single perk carries the potential to be worth more than the total goal for this campaign. Why is that? Well, this is a marathon, not a sprint. The total project will cost on the order of 14,000,000 USD to get from concept to final production. We want to prove to you that we can do this, and the best way to do it (for us and for you) is to do it in stages. For the first stage of the project, we wanted to make it small enough so that it could reasonably be done by a first-timer, but big enough so that it would still be a real accomplishment. So the first real need is a first rate CAD system, and a pair of commercial 3D printers so we can do prototyping in plastic. Once we get a successful plastic prototype, we will use the plastic parts to create a sand cast, which can then be used to create an aluminum prototype.</li>
<li>So what happens if we don't get to our goal for this phase? Well, from a financial standpoint, we buy what we can with the funds from this campaign, and try to get funding for the rest of this phase elsewhere. Failure to get funding in this phase does NOT mean the project is dead. It only means we failed to do what was needed to make this phase successful in this forum. We'll take a hard look at what we did, and how we could do better. And we will do better. We will make this happen, one way or the other. And we want you at the finish line with us when that first series of turbines comes rolling off the line.</li>
<li>What happens if we completely overshoot the goal for this phase? We'll use the extra to fund the next phase of the project. Whatever happens, everything donated will go toward funding this project alone. If we don't get enough, we seek additional means of funding. If we get more than we need, we'll use the extra to build extra capacity on the manufacturing floor, and hire more people to get the turbine into production faster.</li>
</ul><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>So what if you cannot contribute financially? Well, whether you can contribute financially or not, you can still help out, and maybe in the process, take away a little bit of history for yourself:</p><ul>
<li>Tell people about the turbine and about StewardTech. Talk to friends, relatives, coworkers and other associates about what we are doing here.

</ul><p></p></div>","Reduce The Cost of Gas And Improve The Environment!We'd all like to do something about the cost of gas, and we'd all like to use our resources more efficiently. And if we could cut down pollutants and reduce dependence on foreign oil in the process, so much the better. Well, we at StewardTech believe we may have found a way to help do all of these things. And you are invited to join us in the process of bringing this dream to life.We have a unique design (Patent Pending) for a turbine that we believe could replace piston engines in everything from lawnmowers to locomotives. And we believe these turbines will be more efficient, lower maintenance, easier to produce and more durable than their internal combustion counterparts. We think this idea has the potential to revolutionize the transportation industry, and this is your chance to be a proud part of the revolution.The Impact
Your contribution helps advance technology, while helping the environment. The high efficiency turbine will use less gasoline than an equivalent piston engine. 
It costs less to build than a comparable piston engine, and has fewer moving parts, so there's less to break down. You make things cheaper, cleaner and more reliable. That's a pretty big win for everyone.
By helping people use less gas, you also take away dependence on foreign oil. By doing this, in many cases, you take money away from terrorists. 
Your contribution will help create jobs. Maybe a few; hopefully a lot.
You help create something really new that has the potential to make life better for a lot of people. That's a good legacy to have.
About The CompanyIn many ways, StewardTech is a different kind of company. It's a company founded with its primary goal of creating a legacy. One of the things that we will be doing is instead of paying out dividends, when we meet our operational needs, any profits will be used to support charities and social programs that are important to us. Programs like food banks, family crisis centers and missions, first in our own communities, then hopefully reaching out nationally and even internationally. Another difference in StewardTech is that we want to be so much more than just a place to build a career. We want to be a place where we help our people to build rewarding lives, both inside and outside the company. Toward that end, we want work to be as much an experience in corporate worship as it is in producing products. We believe that if we invite God into our work lives, that helps us make better products, and makes us a better company. It also helps us make better decisions along the way. We also want to create an environment of family. We firmly believe we were put here to serve one another, and to help one another along the road of life. Our unity is one of our greatest strengths.We want to build products that make life better. We want our products to use resources more wisely, both in the production of the product, and in its lifetime. We want to create for you not just products that do the job, but that do the job better with less waste along the way.What We Need & What You Get
Let's be honest here: we're just getting started, so what we need is basically everything. Hardware, software, facilities, you name it. And this venture is not without risk. But we believe the basic design is solid, and we think the potential value of our product far outweighs the risk. We think this turbine is a real winner, and when it goes into wide production, it will make people's lives better by reducing their fuel usage, and creating less pollution in the process.
The most important perk is not on our list. The most important perk is the knowledge that you worked to make life a little better for yourself, your children and your fellow man. Isn't that what makes life worthwhile? But do take a look at the perks offered. Some of them are quite valuable (a turbine-powered sports car, for example). But if you add up the total contributions that can be made, every single perk carries the potential to be worth more than the total goal for this campaign. Why is that? Well, this is a marathon, not a sprint. The total project will cost on the order of 14,000,000 USD to get from concept to final production. We want to prove to you that we can do this, and the best way to do it (for us and for you) is to do it in stages. For the first stage of the project, we wanted to make it small enough so that it could reasonably be done by a first-timer, but big enough so that it would still be a real accomplishment. So the first real need is a first rate CAD system, and a pair of commercial 3D printers so we can do prototyping in plastic. Once we get a successful plastic prototype, we will use the plastic parts to create a sand cast, which can then be used to create an aluminum prototype.
So what happens if we don't get to our goal for this phase? Well, from a financial standpoint, we buy what we can with the funds from this campaign, and try to get funding for the rest of this phase elsewhere. Failure to get funding in this phase does NOT mean the project is dead. It only means we failed to do what was needed to make this phase successful in this forum. We'll take a hard look at what we did, and how we could do better. And we will do better. We will make this happen, one way or the other. And we want you at the finish line with us when that first series of turbines comes rolling off the line.
What happens if we completely overshoot the goal for this phase? We'll use the extra to fund the next phase of the project. Whatever happens, everything donated will go toward funding this project alone. If we don't get enough, we seek additional means of funding. If we get more than we need, we'll use the extra to build extra capacity on the manufacturing floor, and hire more people to get the turbine into production faster.
Other Ways You Can HelpSo what if you cannot contribute financially? Well, whether you can contribute financially or not, you can still help out, and maybe in the process, take away a little bit of history for yourself:
Tell people about the turbine and about StewardTech. Talk to friends, relatives, coworkers and other associates about what we are doing here. Be a valuable part of the team by using your network to get us on the radar. Hit every social media outlet you can think of, and get the word out about us.
Find people who you think can be investors and let them know what's going on here.
So, what's in it for you? We're SO glad you asked (no, really, we are).

Introducing LUMINOsquare 


These optical illusions by LUMINOsquare will leave you amazed; wondering how they work, what the science behind them is and why your brain tells you that you are seeing something that your eyes actually aren't. 






   
We need your help to mass produce our lamp. We have collaborated with finest craftsman and manufacturers for sustainable production. We have adhered to highest level of quality and craftsmanship in designing and manufacturing  our lamp. With your help we can bring the lamp into everyone's life and raise a smile .

night lamp to lighten up your room.




The base is made with fine quality wood and is
handcrafted to give the unique look. The design part is made with thick acrylic
glass and the light is warm white LED,
which can last up to 50,000 hours and consumes less energy and doesn’t overheat.long lasting LED light  
The
wood base is cut using CNC machine, which is then finished by our experienced
artesian by hand. Giving the base beautiful handcrafted feel.

acrylic glass designs are created using laser engraving process.
The
LED light circuit is designed to meet the highest electric standards, to give

<p>    Most of the fundings that REBOX received will be used to purchase one <b><i>cutting machinery</i></b> to speed up the process of manufacturing
the products. However, in order to reach the <b><i>large scale production stage</i></b> as well, we will need more funding to make die cutting
from manufacturer which would be very costly.</p>
<p>   The funding that we received will also go into producing <b><i>innovative packaging</i></b> and manufacturing which will not only
protect the products when delivering to customers, but will also appeal
aesthetically to the community.</p>
<p>   We will also be updating and doing <b><i>constant improvements</i></b> to REBOX’s website and design for customer’s ease of use, simple
navigation, continual updates of products, modern design developments and other
enhancements that will ensure customer’s confidence towards REBOX website and
services.</p>
<p>   The funding will be used to produce and <b><i>manufacture the products / perks</i>
</b>ordered by our loyal customers that has given us tremendous support to make
this project a success! Nevertheless, even if the fund we received does not
reach the amount that we pledged, we will still endeavor to produce the <b><i>limited products</i></b> that we promised!</p>
<br/>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446224587/r0qdwcjbtolpvrp60cmz.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Some of the risks
and challenges REBOX has learnt and (learning to) overcome to improve the
quality control of their products:</span>
</div>
<p>1. Cost of laser-cut
service is expensive<br/>
2.Packaging cost is exorbitant<br/>
3.A minimum amount of ordering is require to manufacture products.<br/>
4. Storage issues of finished products.</p>
<p>  Along the way,
constant improvements and modifications will be done to the system in order to
provide better quality products before REBOX’s official launching. Additionally
we are trying to produce <b><i>manual
instructions</i></b> that everyone can easily comprehend, including kids
as young as 5 years old. We will improve the <b><i>tolerance</i></b> and <b><i>gaps</i> </b>between
the slitting joint, to ensure each of the assembly part can be <b><i>fitted smoothly</i></b> and seamlessly
without issues.</p>
<p><i>  <b>Labeling of safety figures</b></i> will be added and shown on the packaging
to increase precaution for parents with young infants. Although the furniture
is made out of corrugated cardboard material with <b><i>no chemical substances</i></b>, it is highly recommended that parents
should be aware of their kids or babies to not bite on the furniture for health
purposes. Nevertheless, the products we produce <b><i>Do not </i></b>contain any <b><i>sharp
edges</i></b>, as such REBOX products will not cause physical harm to the young
ones.</p>
<p>   Water
resistance is our greatest challenge as we do not apply any water-proof coating
to the products. This is mainly due to the fact that most water-resistance
coating contain chemical liquid that is not Eco-friendlyand will make the cardboard
unrecyclable. We are currently working on an add-on water resistance <b><i>""clothing"" product</i></b> containing
several colors to make them more interesting and colorful and also, protecting
the body of the furniture.</p>
<p>  The project is
very time consuming because it requires manually drawing/sketching on raw
material of cardboard without cutting machine. In this case, the time to create
more design is limited hence slowing down the progress as well as testing the
products. (FYI, the products shown above are all <b><i>HANDMADE</i> </b>(except some of the stools)).</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446224022/jqimyrfsmrw3eyueiy8y.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>  In the coming future, we are planning to
collect the <b><i>recycled corrugated
cardboard</i></b> from the recycle
center as well as the packaging material to create the products. It is
definitely <b><i>possible</i></b> to build them by using the recycled
corrugated cardboard in good and clean conditions (some of the products are
made purely from recycled cardboard). In this way, we will be able to optimize
the usage of cardboard before recycling them again, thus creating a sustainable
and safe environment.</p>
<p>    We are
aiming, for future, to work with more <b><i>artistic/creative people</i></b> to provide a variety of designs and to improve the performance
as well as appearance of the products. It can potentially be a <b><i>great platform</i></b> for artists to showcase their amazing works
with REBOX and, in addition, deliver quality and unique products to our valued
customers. </p>

</div></div>","REBOX is an innovative recycable eco-furniture where products are made of pure corrugated cardboard. The ""RE"" in REBOX carries the meaning of recycle - this material is 100% disposable and recyclable. It's great for us to create and sustain a brighter environment. REBOX products comes with the assurance that no chemical or glue was used to construct its innovative furniture, furthermore they are fully functional and have the capability to withstand a certain amount of weight. Without a doubt REBOX furniture are artlessly Cool, Simple, Innovative and Impressive.














     
      Our REBOX
products are great for kids! We have the REBOX kid’s edition where children can scribble and draw to their heart’s content on the furniture itself! As such parents, please do not
worry, for REBOX loves it
when kids get their color pencils and paints on all REBOX products!
By giving kids the ownership of creativity,
it will encourage them to be
brave to try new things,inspire, fun,
build confidence, educate them on arts and colours, allow
‘thinking-out-of-the-box’ mindset,and motivate
their satisfaction and inspiration.
We believe that giving kids this freedom,we are
also giving them an outlet to freely express themselves and enhance their joy
and happiness in art. 











                           


















































    As the material is made out of cardboard, REBOX
furniture is a perfect outlet for you to customize your
own artwork design with color paint on the surface itself. REBOX gives
individuals the opportunity to create a self-portrait of their personality and attitude,
demonstrating an artistic side to the world. You can now draw anything you
desire and the outcome will be beautiful,
unique and  personal to the individual's taste. As of current, we are
fortunate to have a budding young artist who has showcased her amazing
calligraphy on REBOX products. We wish to achieve this great collaboration and confident that it will serve both parties
with mutual benefits.

Adding a little bit of creativity by stacking up the boxes  [L.O.V.E ]







   
 

    Most of the fundings that REBOX received will be used to purchase one cutting machinery to speed up the process of manufacturing
the products. However, in order to reach the large scale production stage as well, we will need more funding to make die cutting
from manufacturer which would be very costly.
   The funding that we received will also go into producing innovative packaging and manufacturing which will not only
protect the products when delivering to customers, but will also appeal
aesthetically to the community.
   We will also be updating and doing constant improvements to REBOX’s website and design for customer’s ease of use, simple
navigation, continual updates of products, modern design developments and other
enhancements that will ensure customer’s confidence towards REBOX website and
services.
   The funding will be used to produce and manufacture the products / perks
ordered by our loyal customers that has given us tremendous support to make
this project a success! Nevertheless, even if the fund we received does not
reach the amount that we pledged, we will still endeavor to produce the limited products that we promised!

  


Some of the risks
and challenges REBOX has learnt and (learning to) overcome to improve the
quality control of their products:

1. Cost of laser-cut
service is expensive
2.Packaging cost is exorbitant
3.A minimum amount of ordering is require to manufacture products.
4. Storage issues of finished products.
  Along the way,
constant improvements and modifications will be done to the system in order to
provide better quality products before REBOX’s official launching. Additionally
we are trying to produce manual
instructions that everyone can easily comprehend, including kids
as young as 5 years old. We will improve the tolerance and gaps between
the slitting joint, to ensure each of the assembly part can be fitted smoothly and seamlessly
without issues.
  Labeling of safety figures will be added and shown on the packaging
to increase precaution for parents with young infants. Although the furniture
is made out of corrugated cardboard material with no chemical substances, it is highly recommended that parents
should be aware of their kids or babies to not bite on the furniture for health
purposes. Nevertheless, the products we produce Do not contain any sharp
edges, as such REBOX products will not cause physical harm to the young
ones.
   Water
resistance is our greatest challenge as we do not apply any water-proof coating
to the products. This is mainly due to the fact that most water-resistance
coating contain chemical liquid that is not Eco-friendlyand will make the cardboard
unrecyclable. We are currently working on an add-on water resistance ""clothing"" product containing
several colors to make them more interesting and colorful and also, protecting
the body of the furniture.
  The project is
very time consuming because it requires manually drawing/sketching on raw
material of cardboard without cutting machine. In this case, the time to create
more design is limited hence slowing down the progress as well as testing the
products. (FYI, the products shown above are all HANDMADE (except some of the stools)).





  In the coming future, we are planning to
collect the recycled corrugated
cardboard from the recycle
center as well as the packaging material to create the products. It is
definitely possible to build them by using the recycled
corrugated cardboard in good and clean conditions (some of the products are
made purely from recycled cardboard). In this way, we will be able to optimize
the usage of cardboard before recycling them again, thus creating a sustainable
and safe environment.
    We are
aiming, for future, to work with more artistic/creative people to provide a variety of designs and to improve the performance
as well as appearance of the products. It can potentially be a great platform for artists to showcase their amazing works
with REBOX and, in addition, deliver quality and unique products to our valued
customers.",125.0,0,"1 Campaign

MAX is smart enough to detect Fire Alarms, Carbon Monoxide Alarms, Hurricanes, Tornadoes, Flash Flooding and even a terrorist threat. MAX's warning system will alert you in multiple ways within seconds of determining a threat. MAX sends an audible alert in 520Hz, 3200Hz and Voice. In addition to the three audible alerts, MAX also provides a strobe light and path light to help you find your way to safety. Remote Notification Alerts of any threat of danger are sent automatically to authorized smartphones, or an outside monitoring service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         ""If only I knew...""  Now you can with MAX!    Smart Enough to Save Your Life !As parents our job is to protect our loved ones from potential threats.  When a disaster occurs, we often find ourselves saying “ If I only knew I could have….”    MAX is the first device that is Smart Enough to Save your life.  MAX not only monitors your home for Security Threats, it connects to and monitors Homeland Security, FEMA and NOAA for advance warnings that might be life threatening.  No matter if your sleeping or away MAX keeps an eye out for you and within seconds gives you Early Warnings to possible Home Intrusions or disasters, such as Hurricanes, Fires, Tornadoes, Flooding, and even potential terrorist threats.  Peace of Mind and all you have to do is Simply Plug it in.  Now that is Smart!                                                                                                                                                    2 Minutes...That's how much time you have to get out!    ""Being too late....""  not an option when its family !Two Minutes is the average amount of time you have to get your family awake and out of the house.  With MAX you can receive an Early Warning of a Tornado as much as 15 minutes before you see it.  The advanced technologies that we designed into MAX are smart enough to give you the most advanced warning of any Home Safety and Security Product on the market.   More Time..... that's what MAX gives you!   More time to get you and your family to safety.                                                                                                                                                      Smoke Alarm detects a fire....MAX provides the Alerts to make sure wake up and get out!  It's that simple.  92% of children and most Seniors will sleep through the sound of a standard smoke alarm.    ""You bought smoke alarms because you thought they would protect your family ""This is the common mistake that many people make, they think because a smoke alarm is loud, that everyone will wake up.   A smoke alarm is around 100 decibels load.   That's not the problem.  The problem is the frequency is too high at 3200 Hz for children and adults with hearing lose to hear it in their sleep.  That's why most fire related deaths occur while people are sleeping. We developed the MAX Smart Alarm technology based on the Safety Research that resulted in the  requirement for Hotels and Assisted Living facilities to install alternative alarms that broadcast a lower frequency of 520Hz in every room.  The MAX Smart Alarm not only broadcasts 3200Hz and 520Hz  but announces an Alert with Human Voice and gives visual alerts including a Strobe Light and Escape Path Light.   Helping you Escape Danger with Alerts that wake everyone in your family is our goal.  You made the right decision by installing smoke detectors, but now you need MAX Smart Alarm to remove the unnecessary risks to you and your family.  Smoke Alarm detects a fire....MAX provides the Escape Alerts to make sure you get out!  It's that simple.                                                                                                                                                     Waking effectiveness of AlarmsIn April of 2006, The Fire Protection Research Foundation was awarded a Fire Prevention and Safety Grant by the US Fire Administration to study the effectiveness of alarms for emergency notification.   Below are some excerpts from this 100 page research document.  The full document can be download or sent to by email.Standard Smoke Alarms are based on 3200Hz“ Under the testing conditions a 520 Hz square wave T-3 sounds was the single most effective signal, awakening 92%...significantly more effective than the 3200Hz pure tone T-3 sound , which awoke 56%.” page 9“In some cases a smoke alarm may not arouse the sleeping occupants in time to escape and a lack of response, or a delayed response clearly increases the chances of dying in a fire” (Thomas and Brennan, 2004) Page 14“Interesting the same 520 Hz square wave signal has also been found to be more effective at waking sleeping children (Bruck, Reid, Kouzma and Ball 2004) page 18

With MAX you don't need a video camera to be protected. We have all seen the headlines of countless accounts of ""hackers"" tapping into the homes of innocent families through their WiFi enabled Video Cameras.  Knowing that this is a major concern for families, MAX designed our MAX Smart Alarm to work with or without a home video monitor.   With MAX you don't need to feel insecure about you Security.                                                                                                                                                     Everyday LifeWe believe that Safety and Security should be integrated into your everyday life.   That is why we designed our Life Saving Technology into a product that everyone uses around the house everyday... a light.   Not only does MAX Smart Alarm light your way in an emergency it provides an everyday path light and Nightlight for your family.   It even comes with a Sleep Application that allows you to select Nature sounds to listen to while you fall asleep.  Sleep well... knowing MAX is watching over you and your family. Simply plug it in!                                                                                                                                                     Our StoryAfter decades of time working on high tech solutions to solve business problems or everyday tasks, we were driven to take that experience and product development expertise to develop something that had the potential to really make a difference - potentially save someone's life.We took our personal real-life experiences as parents with young children; families with aging parents; and home owners/ renters and we researched the market to identify ways to make people feel safer, more secure and more comfortable in their homes.MAX Smart Home was founded to comfort, enlighten and protect families with simple home technologies that foresee dangers, predict needs, react to behavior and deliver peace of mind. So we set out to identify areas within the home where lives could be saved like the dangers presented by fire, carbon monoxide leaks, and external threats like tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, wild fires and localized terrorist threats.Our first products were quickly picked by The Home Depot and we wanted to build on that success and find ways to expand the alert capabilities of MAX, so we developed MAX Smart Alarm. We enhanced earlier versions with two tone alerts and voice alerts, Wi-Fi connectivity and the addition of Early Warning Alerts from NOAA and Homeland Security.We are very excited about this new addition to the MAX Family of products as we continue pushing the boundaries in home intelligence, comfort and control technology to help everyone shine a light on harm, protect their families, and make home a personal sanctuary.                                                                                                                                                    Risks & ChallengesMAX Smart Home has already established engineering and manufacturing partnerships around the world and MAX has already started production in China.

  Both systems come with a compact active woofer designed in-house by our audio engineers. The SLAM woofer, as we’ve affectionately named it, is separate from the main electrostatic speaker set, but can be installed in a matter of seconds, supplying a complementary sound at the same volume level. The electrostatic speakers supply the crisp mid and high-range frequencies while the SLAM underlines this with rich bass.The Slam active subwoofer is perfectly tuned to supply the bottom end bass in your movies, music and games, giving a deep, soulful sound in addition to the crisp, clear audio of the main electrostatic speakers. You also have the option of connecting your own active woofer to get the exact bass sound you want. The Slam has been designed to be used laying down or standing up. 200 Watt Stereo amplifierThe built-in stereo amplifier is capable of delivering 200 Watts RMS total output. Enough sound for large rooms, lounges, and even noisy or crowded areas.

However, everything in life has risks, and we have certainly identified and calculated all of them. One major obstacle could be having limited retailers on our e-market. However, with our local and national partnerships and alliances, this risk is rather small.Other challenges could involve the quirks and kinks of any software development, but with in-house tech geniuses and a constant ear to the ground, we should be apt and nimble enough to blast through any bugs quickly and efficiently.crowdfunding campaign powered by:",23.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p><strong>Mosquito Research &amp; Development: </strong><br/>After the first generation of the Mosquito Box we have kept on thinking up idea's to increase the efficacy on catching mosquito's. Our biggest challenge has always been to keep adapting innovative technology into our traps and keep up with the ever evolving mosquito and mosquito diseases.</p>
<p>To keep this Risk as minimum as possible we keep contact with lead researchers like Biogents (Germany) and with our history of cooperation with public instances in Hong Kong we have developed many ways of testing our devices. We have the knowledge and materials, but we need more supporters for us to show that we can be one of the leading fighters against mosquitoes.</p>
<p><strong>Production Risk: </strong><br/>As we have produced mosquito traps for over 8 years and have experienced many kinds of problems, we have the confidence that we can deliver this product in time. Most of the research &amp; development of the MBOX has been done before we went on kickstarter and as for the production, most of the initial stages have been produced before as the first generation of the MBOX and we have made a few adjustments to the MBOX and added a USB 3.0 to increase the efficacy of the MBOX. As this is something we have done before, we do not expect any problems this time around. I promise if there is something going on we will be clear and honest to our backers. As we have reached our Goal before, i am sure we can do it again.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping Risks: </strong><br/>As we are still looking for better ways of shipping our products to our backers. We have looked at the best and safest ways to get our MBOX to you in one piece. One of the most important aspects is that our packaging is sturdy and able to protect the MBOX. </p>
<p>For the shipping we are looking to cooperate with UPS/DHL/FEDEX (they gave us a estimate price). At this moment we are also looking for other shipment methods to get our MBOX to our backers in case there is something wrong with our current couriers (UPS/DHL/FEDEX).</p>
<p>We have already reduced the shipping from 250 -&gt; 215 HKD as we have done a lot of research and with our backers from our previous project we were able to get a better deal. the current shipping will be done by DHL</p>
<h2>Relaunching the Project on Indiegogo</h2>
<p>Dear Backers &amp; Supporters,</p>
<p>We had an incredible launch few weeks ago and we had reached over 150% of our target within 20 days. But suddenly due to circumstances Kickstarter has suspended us. Our production is already halfway and our estimate is to ship out at the end of August. (See our Update#2 for some testing pictures :)! )</p>
<p>After working on solutions with our backers &amp; supporters as to why we suddenly were suspended. We were not able to come to any conclusion as where the mishaps are. We have been looking for solutions on how to give our backers and supporters to attain our Mosquito Box. Kickstarter has been ignoring our requests ever since.</p>
<p>Many have wondered what we are going to do now. The Fight against mosquito is not something we can easily give up on, we cannot be stopped by a minor setback. So that is why we are back again, we are not willing to give up and this is a fight that we once again need your support.</p>
<p>If you feel like i have missed any information, just send me a message or comment on the project and i will help you further.</p>
<p>Thanks once again, and let us succeed this time! IndieGoGo is known to be fair &amp; honest. As we put our hopes here to continue our fight! This time with the flexible funding we can guarantee that our backers can receive our product.</p>
<p>Yours Sincerely,</p>

We are already in the testing & production phase and once IndieGoGo has successfully ended, we can ship our mosquito boxes out and the estimated arrival at your doorstep is on early/mid september!  

Why did we Develop the Mosquito Box?

The main reason for developing the mosquito box has been started from a tragic story. A story that turned into a dream to being able to protect the people from mosquito.   
The increasing population on earth and urbanization all over the world is causing problems everywhere around the world. The current indoor mosquito traps have been based on technology from the past. We had to re-invent.  
So we went back to the drawing board, adding in research and innovations from the last few years to develop a new generation of smart mosquito traps that are suitable for the current society. Efficient and effective.



A Short Story from Brian LamseeFrom an Innocent Family Trip to a Nightmare
 

We will continue the fight! We need Help! 
Our mission is to protect people from mosquito and help people that have caught these terrible insects. We cannot fight this alone and we need your help. Time is ticking and nobody knows when the next deadly mosquito disease is going to appear.  
QM Limited has a long history of fighting against mosquitoes in Hong Kong. QM has developed many traps in cooperation with public instances in Hong Kong. But this is was only our first step, we have technology to create even more efficient mosquito traps and we want to be able to give everyone a chance to use it to fight against mosquitoes at home. Mosquito borne disease keep mutating and who knows when a new one will appear. Mosquitoes are already the world deadliest animal that kills over 750.000 people a year(Gates Notes). Even though we can continue the road we have walked in the past, but time is something we cannot fight and only with your help we can accomplish this fight and give our children a safer world.



 


The Trapping Methods

The Mosquito Box uses a combination of different methods to specifically lure female mosquitoes (the ones that bite) into our traps. Below you can find the list of technology and links to their workings.  
- Co2/H2o from the Tio2 coated surface  - Dark color design  - Heat & Spectral Wavelengths from the CCFL/UV Light  - (optional) Attractants from Biogents (Germany) 
Photocatalysis effect (Tio2 -> co2/h2o)  
Female mosquitoes track humans by tracing Co2 and H2o. They can track Co2 up to 50 meters and follow it back to the place of origin.  
The UV light of the Mosquito Box irradiates a surface coated with Titanium Dioxide to enable the photo catalysis effect (see below) to lure mosquitoes.  
This effect is discovered by Dr. Akira Fujishima from Tokyo University of Science and it helps simulate the human breath of Co2 and moisture that mosquitoes use to track their prey.


Mosquito Sight (Dark Color Design)  
Mosquitoes have 2 compound eyes. The compound eyes are made up of many hundreds if not, thousands of lenses called ommatidia.  
Testing with different colors we noticed that mosquitoes prefer the color black over any other. Another interesting fact is that mosquitoes stay in groups. With our Mirroring surface it will give the feeling to the mosquito that she is not flying alone to the prey and increase the chances of the mosquito nearing our Mosquito Box.

USB 3.0 (Quick Charge) / (Heat Generation) 
We have incorporated a USB 3.0 to easily recharge your Phone. We have thought of many ways in increasing the heat generation of the Mosquito Box to attract mosquito's but many would incorporate wasting energy to generate heat. 
By adding the USB Charger to charge your phone, the Mosquito Box and your Phone produces extra heat to attract mosquitoes, This way it will not waste any energy and produce our desired extra heat attraction.


Spectral Attraction (CCFL/UV Color)  
The light that a CCFL light produces attracts mosquitoes since it has been adjusted to give off the same body heat of human body’s. The light itself also emits a special spectrum that attracts mosquitoes and other flying insects.  
A CCFL light can last up to 40.000+ hours in comparison to the traditional UV lights that people still use from decades ago, there is no need to exchange the light bulbs anymore. Another interesting thing is that a CCFL light uses 60% less energy than the traditional UV bulbs. 



Biogents Attractants (Optional Attractants) 
Researchers of Biogents (University of Regensburg / Germany) have over 16 years of research regarding the olfactory system of mosquitoes.  
We have implemented their sweet scent attractants into our traps. With the following results as seen below.  
Our Mosquito Box can function without the optional attractants. If you include the attractants into your trap, you can increase the trapping efficacy.


Capturing Mosquitoes  
The Mosquito Box has a fan for two purposes. The fan acts as a suction device to suck in mosquitoes that are attracted to the Mosquito Box.  
The second function is to make sure that the Co2/H2o that is generated can be spread out.


The Mosquito Box Usage  
The Mosquito Box is designed for indoor usage but is also capable functioning outdoors like for your garden/patio or balcony.  
The MBOX is a specialized device that lures in mosquitoes by offering an alternative for the mosquito, when there are no options available for the mosquito to bite like in your living room or bed room it will be attracted to the trap and captured.  
The most important aspect is that you have to keep the trap on when there are no alternatives for mosquitoes to guarantee a 100% capture rate.

Our biggest challenge has always been to keep adapting innovative technology into our traps and keep up with the ever evolving mosquito and mosquito diseases.
To keep this Risk as minimum as possible we keep contact with lead researchers like Biogents (Germany) and with our history of cooperation with public instances in Hong Kong we have developed many ways of testing our devices. We have the knowledge and materials, but we need more supporters for us to show that we can be one of the leading fighters against mosquitoes.
Production Risk: As we have produced mosquito traps for over 8 years and have experienced many kinds of problems, we have the confidence that we can deliver this product in time. Most of the research & development of the MBOX has been done before we went on kickstarter and as for the production, most of the initial stages have been produced before as the first generation of the MBOX and we have made a few adjustments to the MBOX and added a USB 3.0 to increase the efficacy of the MBOX. As this is something we have done before, we do not expect any problems this time around. I promise if there is something going on we will be clear and honest to our backers. As we have reached our Goal before, i am sure we can do it again.
Shipping Risks: As we are still looking for better ways of shipping our products to our backers. We have looked at the best and safest ways to get our MBOX to you in one piece. One of the most important aspects is that our packaging is sturdy and able to protect the MBOX. 
For the shipping we are looking to cooperate with UPS/DHL/FEDEX (they gave us a estimate price). At this moment we are also looking for other shipment methods to get our MBOX to our backers in case there is something wrong with our current couriers (UPS/DHL/FEDEX).
We have already reduced the shipping from 250 -> 215 HKD as we have done a lot of research and with our backers from our previous project we were able to get a better deal. the current shipping will be done by DHL
Relaunching the Project on Indiegogo
Dear Backers & Supporters,
We had an incredible launch few weeks ago and we had reached over 150% of our target within 20 days. But suddenly due to circumstances Kickstarter has suspended us. Our production is already halfway and our estimate is to ship out at the end of August. (See our Update#2 for some testing pictures :)! )
After working on solutions with our backers & supporters as to why we suddenly were suspended. We were not able to come to any conclusion as where the mishaps are. We have been looking for solutions on how to give our backers and supporters to attain our Mosquito Box. Kickstarter has been ignoring our requests ever since.
Many have wondered what we are going to do now. The Fight against mosquito is not something we can easily give up on, we cannot be stopped by a minor setback. So that is why we are back again, we are not willing to give up and this is a fight that we once again need your support.
If you feel like i have missed any information, just send me a message or comment on the project and i will help you further.
Thanks once again, and let us succeed this time! IndieGoGo is known to be fair & honest. As we put our hopes here to continue our fight! This time with the flexible funding we can guarantee that our backers can receive our product.
Yours Sincerely,

Currently we're selling a mid-line Rokher at $1280 and the Sunburst at $1480. We will still be offering a high-end Rokher with new color schemes at $1480 - but we want to appeal to the mid-market, which is 4 times larger than the high-end category.

Giving theses artists a Rokher they can brand with their signature, color scheme and the back of the chair will be shaped like their guitar head stock type.  From there they can promote and sell their signature Rokher through online sales.<br/>- This is the precursor to setting up an Affiliate Marketing Program for up-n-coming working musicians. Whereby by promoting the Rokher they can earn monies, so they can stay focused on their craft - not working some dead-end job</p><p># 5 Increase Festival Participation:<br/>Last year, as Sponsors over half of our Rokhers we sold through festivals. We were Merle Fest Sponsors again this year (selling 9 chairs) and we're negotiating with 14 other Festivals to be Sponsor/Vendors (average Sponsor Vendor cost is $2k). So, we are upgrading our Booth, Banners, Brochures and hiring support teams. </p><p>{Drum roll please}</p><p>We’d like you to become a Rokher ambassador and help us fund the Rokher’s 2017 national roll-out. With your invaluable financial and social media marketing support (sharing this campaign and the Rokher website), the Rokher will become the preeminent brand in the category and we will sell over 300 Rokhers this year. And through our Affiliate programs - help so many other artists realize their creativity.<br/><br/>Thank you for your interest and investment in the Rokher.<br/><br/>“kick back and rock on,”</p><p>Timothy J.

Not to mention months of interviews to; select the right craftsmen and furniture builders to partner with to press the 17 layers of hardwood to make the one-piece chair, articulate the long smooth rocker runs with precision mortise & tenon joinery of the all Ash rocker legs and cleats and to have the right hard-shell finishing. In March 2016 my vision is realized in the Rokher: a Patent Pending, all American made heirloom rocker that's timeless in its Euro-minimalist aesthetics and ergonomically correct.UTILIZATION OF FUNDS:# 1 - Increase Production Runs:This will dramatically reduce our wholesale cost so we can offer a basic Rokher to select music stores & boutiques that they can retail at $880 - which will literally quadruple our market size. Currently we're selling a mid-line Rokher at $1280 and the Sunburst at $1480. We will still be offering a high-end Rokher with new color schemes at $1480 - but we want to appeal to the mid-market, which is 4 times larger than the high-end category. Additionally, with increased production throughput we will actually increase our quality and color finishing refinements.# 2 - R&D + Product Line Extensions:- Ottoman Dual-Tone Cajon where you can tap your foot to make bass and woodblock tones - Advanced acoustical refinements where the Rokher becomes an extension of your instrument- Branded Rokher Cushions (seat, back and neck - these help shorter folks adjust their height)- New Rokher Chair Mold for people 5' - 5'10""- On-Stage, fold-able traveling unit  # 3 - Own the Category- Drive our online Sales through aggressive Direct Marketing, Social & PR campaigns- Launch a 12 month marketing intensive in Nashville where we're featured in publications, at salons, at high-end retail boutiques, music stores, and premiering at music venues, insider parties and studios- Select 3 other major music cities to partner with key publications, retailers and interior designers# 4  Celebrity Endorsements:To expand national recognition, the Rokher will sponsor 10 major musicians for their endorsement. Giving theses artists a Rokher they can brand with their signature, color scheme and the back of the chair will be shaped like their guitar head stock type.  From there they can promote and sell their signature Rokher through online sales.- This is the precursor to setting up an Affiliate Marketing Program for up-n-coming working musicians. Whereby by promoting the Rokher they can earn monies, so they can stay focused on their craft - not working some dead-end job# 5 Increase Festival Participation:Last year, as Sponsors over half of our Rokhers we sold through festivals. We were Merle Fest Sponsors again this year (selling 9 chairs) and we're negotiating with 14 other Festivals to be Sponsor/Vendors (average Sponsor Vendor cost is $2k). So, we are upgrading our Booth, Banners, Brochures and hiring support teams. {Drum roll please}We’d like you to become a Rokher ambassador and help us fund the Rokher’s 2017 national roll-out. With your invaluable financial and social media marketing support (sharing this campaign and the Rokher website), the Rokher will become the preeminent brand in the category and we will sell over 300 Rokhers this year. And through our Affiliate programs - help so many other artists realize their creativity.Thank you for your interest and investment in the Rokher.“kick back and rock on,”Timothy J.

<p>Comedian Invents Germ and Virus Killer</p>
<p>WEST NYACK, N.Y. - May 12, 2020 - (Newswire.com)</p>
<p>When Comedian Brett Eidman goes on stage his goal is to “kill” the audience. In comedy lingo, “kill” means to make the audience laugh hysterically. However, Eidman’s new goal is no laughing matter. Now, he wants to kill germs, viruses, and bacteria that we unwittingly walk right into our home. “We carry germs, viruses, bacteria, E.coli, Coronavirus, and MERSA on the bottom of our shoes. These pathogens can become airborne. Even if we remove our shoes, the germs and viruses have already invaded our home and can make us ill,” says Eidman.</p>
<p>For these reasons, this comedian turned inventor created Pro Mat 99. The Pro Mat 99 is a portable, battery-operated, UVC sole sanitizing device. Pro Mat 99 is an inch and a half thick platform modeled after a doormat. The left section is a rubber scrape mat. The right section is an open design steel platform that is housed directly above the UVC lamps. It’s simple, you step onto the rubber mat, wipe your feet, then step to the right onto the steel platform and in seconds your shoes are sanitized.</p>
<p>Eidman goes on to say, “Over the past four years, I’ve worked with electrical and mechanical engineers, lawyers, and a top product designer. I finally got Pro Mat 99 to be of the quality people deserve and I demanded. The entire process has been extremely expensive, and we still need to make molds and go into production, therefore I put up an Indiegogo campaign to help raise the funds. I’m very excited to bring Pro Mat 99 to the world.”</p>
<p>If you would like to join him on his mission, please check out Pro Mat 99 on Indiegogo <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pro-mat-99-kills-germs-and-viruses-in-1-step/x/879352?create_edit=true#%C2%A0or"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pro-mat-99-k...</a> visit <a href=""http://www.promat99.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.promat99.com</a>.</p>

Pro Mat 99 was born but not without many trials and tribulations.  My first idea was to make a doormat that housed a sanitizing mat.  I thought you could wipe your feet as you would wipe your hands.  I met with one of the largest wet wipe companies in the world.  I showed them my prototype but was told it would not work.  Air was my enemy.  The big wipe would dry up too quickly.
When I described my disappointment to my son he told me how his dentist used UV light to sterilize his instruments.  This was an idea I could work with!  UVC light is specifically designed to kill germs, viruses, bacteria, E Coli, and can be used to kill the coronavirus.  I immediately began to sketch a UVC doormat.  I gave my rough illustration to a mechanical engineer to move forward with my second prototype. 

After dozens of obstacles and several more prototypes PRO MAT 99 was completed.  The PRO MAT 99 is made solid, durable material including steel. 
The PRO MAT 99 will provide a cleaner, healthier environment for all.  I truly believe every home and business should own a PRO MAT 99. I have spent a fortune creating this highly effective quality product.  I am now in need of financial help.  Your funds will be used for injection molds and production.  I am ready to deliver PRO MAT 99 to the world. I hope you will join me in this effort and get the word out to family and friends. Plus, please check out the unique perks!  Let’s do this together!
Thank you so much,
Brett

Comedian Invents Germ and Virus Killer
WEST NYACK, N.Y. - May 12, 2020 - (Newswire.com)
When Comedian Brett Eidman goes on stage his goal is to “kill” the audience. In comedy lingo, “kill” means to make the audience laugh hysterically. However, Eidman’s new goal is no laughing matter. Now, he wants to kill germs, viruses, and bacteria that we unwittingly walk right into our home. “We carry germs, viruses, bacteria, E.coli, Coronavirus, and MERSA on the bottom of our shoes. These pathogens can become airborne. Even if we remove our shoes, the germs and viruses have already invaded our home and can make us ill,” says Eidman.
For these reasons, this comedian turned inventor created Pro Mat 99. The Pro Mat 99 is a portable, battery-operated, UVC sole sanitizing device. Pro Mat 99 is an inch and a half thick platform modeled after a doormat. The left section is a rubber scrape mat. The right section is an open design steel platform that is housed directly above the UVC lamps. It’s simple, you step onto the rubber mat, wipe your feet, then step to the right onto the steel platform and in seconds your shoes are sanitized.
Eidman goes on to say, “Over the past four years, I’ve worked with electrical and mechanical engineers, lawyers, and a top product designer. I finally got Pro Mat 99 to be of the quality people deserve and I demanded. The entire process has been extremely expensive, and we still need to make molds and go into production, therefore I put up an Indiegogo campaign to help raise the funds. I’m very excited to bring Pro Mat 99 to the world.”
If you would like to join him on his mission, please check out Pro Mat 99 on Indiegogo https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pro-mat-99-k... visit www.promat99.com.

When using the faucet or shower, clamp the faucet over the sink basin, flip on the pump and enjoy.    Instead of manual pumping, our USB-powered pump does the work for you and enables delivery of water wherever it is needed. With the powerful pump, GoSun Flow purifies one liter of water per minute! Get clean water extra fast anywhere you need.The pump is powered by an included powerbank and can pump over 100 gallons of water on a single charge. When you’re done, easily recharge it with the sun. The integrated solar panel plugs right into the powerbank to charge it up.   Our cutting-edge 3-stage cartridge filter removes 99.99% of pathogens. First, a polypropylene filter disc removes large particles like dirt, rust, and sand. Second, a high-efficiency carbon filter absorbs hazardous chemicals and heavy metals. Finally, a nano aluminum fiber filter creates an electropositive charge in a labyrinth of fibers to trap and kill the tiniest particles and organisms in your water. Best of all, the filter lasts for 1,000 liters of filtration and can be easily replaced.   GoSun is leading the fuel-free frontier, utilizing the best in clean tech to help you USE MORE SUN.  We love being outdoors, sharing food and drinks, but we don't love the mess and distance to clean, running water.  Now, you can make fresh water and have a mobile hand washing station, anywhere.    Current water filters require you to suck or pump water out of the source manually.  If you've ever actually used one, you know, sucking is sucky.  Purifying water is complex and traditional filters require lots of diligence to maintain. That's why GoSun developed a 3-stage filter with a super efficient pump to do the job.   The Flow has your water needs covered.  Use the filter alone to purify water, or use the pump to 1) purify water 2) setup a sink, or 3) setup a shower.  Through years of development, GoSun has designed the Flow to make your outdoor water needs as easy as possible.  There is no comparison for both water purification and delivery in a mobile package.    
Fill GoSun Fusion with water
Wait 30 minutes for it to be fully heated up
Connect GoSun Flow intake tube
Pump
Shower
 No Patience, No ProblemThere are a lot of slow 'solar showers' that can take all day to heat up, and it better be a warm, sunny day or your shower will be frigid.  Thanks to the GoSun Fusion's vacuum insulation and optimized reflectors, a five minute long warm shower can be solar heated in just 30 minutes.  At night or indoors, the submersible 12Volt heater does the job in about one hour.    The Flex Faucet's integrated clamp can open to over two and a quarter inches (58mm) so it attaches anywhere: branches, tables, tailgates, fences, etc.  The flexible head can twist, bend and point water to wherever you need it.  Need to hydrate now? Flow gives you a variety of options to access clean water. Fill up the included water bag and drink on the go, attach a bottle to the filter and drink through it, or drink directly from the source through the filter like a straw.
Pump from source
Use the included water bag
Attach water bottle
Drink directly like a straw
  Using USB On The Go (USB OTG) you can also plug the pump directly to your phone's battery to create or deliver fresh water.  A typical phone can it run for hours since the pump is super efficient. This feature works with most Android phones using an USB OTG Adapter, but not easily with iPhones.   Hand washing is key to staying healthy.  Now, you can wash whenever and wherever you want.  Today, it's hard to know all the places where washing would be helpful and you cannot be too careful. Rubbing alcohol based cleaners, while effective, smear around dirt and leave your hands dry, cracked, and oddly fragrant. Stay clean while you are away from home. Flow is great for camping, international travel, backyard BBQs, boating, outdoor events, jobsites, beaches, RVs, cookouts, and being generally prepared. During these times, it is very helpful to have a sanitation system with you at all times.   The durable, EVA pump station contains all the critical parts in one place: 3-stage filter, USB pump, powerbank, and hoses.  Plus, the integrated solar panel keeps it charged up.  We all want to live more independent, healthy and resilient lives. GoSun has developed breakthrough solar technologies that can cook, cool, light, power electronics and now, purify and deliver water. These affordable products are all portable, highly efficient and free of harmful emissions. Indiegogo pricing is the lowest possible at over 40% off retail, because backers are pre-ordering. We've structured the rewards so they build off of one another, with each package including the base Flow.  In other words, every reward includes the items from the lower priced tiers, with new accessories added into each reward tier.For a closer look at bundled GoSun accessories, follow these links: GoSun Fusion,  GoSun Chill, GoSun Thermo, 144wh PowerBank. This is our eighth crowdfunded product, and we've always delivered.   The GoSun Flow has been in development for years, so we are ready for production.  Your pledge and this campaign will push the Flow forward.  GoSun is committed to making the highest quality and most accessible solar powered products.  We build products to be relied on day in and day out, so you can get the most from them.  Take a deep look at the Specs or FAQ's and then send us a message if you don't find your answer. We are happy to help.Collapsible SinkCollapsible sink fills with up to nine liters, folds down to just two inches and the integrated basket handles make it easy to carry a full load.Filter The unique three-stage filter removes 99.99% of pathogens, including viruses, thanks to a powerful, electropositive charge generated by nanoalumina fibers. It does not require backflushing or rinsing, yet it lasts for up to 1,000 liters.Pump Drawing only two watts, this diaphragm pump can move about one liter per minute while running on any USB source. No regular maintenance, plus the pump is fully serviceable for years of water delivery.Flex Faucet w/ Clamp and SwitchA faucet, showerhead, clamp and switch assembly in one, this highly flexible element sets up anywhere in seconds.

    Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot contribute, visit our Facebook page and like and follow us on Facebook.  Let your Facebook friends know about the Autrey House and the important mission to once again restore and maintain the home.  You can visit us on Facebook at www.Facebook.com/AutreyHouse.  In short, share the word about Autrey House!

<p>Malaysia is ahead of most countries in South East Asia when it comes to the basic human needs and right of rural communities. Yet, still there are approximately 150,000 people living without any access to electricity, and no street light or lamps to light up their streets, villages, and even inside their homes. </p>
<p>This causes more crime, more safety hazards, more wild animal attacks, and fewer opportunities for the villagers to socialize at night, or to grab a book and read while it's dark. </p>
<h3>A brief history</h3>
<p>This project is not some idea, crazy dream, or brain fart. We have done this project multiple times in the past year in Malaysia, and have seen incredible impact:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Installed 210 lights in 4 villages, with a total of 143 households</li>
<li>481 volunteers have participated</li>
<li>3 schools can now teach at night</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>With your support we will be able to 'light up' 2 entire villages in rural Malaysia, and give them a Christmas like never before. </p>
<p>Here's what we can do with your financial support:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Light up 2<b> villages</b>, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>100+ families</b>, and <b>1250</b></span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b> underprivileged people</b> will have access to this basic need. </span>
</li>
<li>
<b>200 student volunteers</b> will participate and experience what it is like to participate in meaningful projects</li>
<li>
<b>Safety hazards</b> in the village will be significantly reduced (e.g. no more need for campfires inside the house)</li>
<li>Children will be able to study at night, there will be <b>better education opportunities</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>The environment will become safer</b> and the villagers will be less at risk to e.g. snake bites, and wild animal attacks. </li>
</ul>

</div>
</div><div>
<div>
<p>First an Incitement event is organized. This is a free event available to all. During this event there will be renowned speakers (local and international speakers) sharing their stories, and also more information about Liter of Light will be provided. Attendees can then sign up as volunteers for this project.</p>
<p>Once you are accepted as a volunteer, o<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">n the first day (Saturday) there will be 'The Build'. All volunteers meet at Makespace (our venue partner) to literally build and assemble the solar powered lights. This is a fantastic learning experience. </span></p>
<p>On the second day (Sunday) is 'The Installation'. We will drive up to Cameron Highlands in West-Malaysia, and drive into the jungle on 4-wheel-drives to reach to the villages. There we'll plant the light into the ground together with the villagers, and witness the lights lighting up when it gets dark. And best of all, witness the response of the villagers when the see light in their village for the first time.</p>
<h3>When will it happen?</h3>
<p>We will do this 2 weekends between Thanksgiving and Christmas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Village 1 - 5th &amp; 6th of December</li>

<h3>Why does one light cost $325?</h3>
<div>You might be wondering, why are the total cost of 1 solar light $325? It's because we fous on delivering a lasting, sustainable solution that will last for years to come. </div>
<div>Allows us to explain :-)</div>
<div>The solar powered lights that Liter of Light builds and provides last up to 4 years, and comes with an extra supply of batteries, circuits, and LED lights, so that the villagers themselves can replace the lights after  the 1st 4 year cycles. </div>
<div>During the installation the villagers are trained how they can replace the vital parts of the lights themselves. For most of them it is the first time they see light without power lines and cables, and it is vital that they receive interactive, comprehensive training on how to maintain and replace certain parts of the lights. <p>The end-goal is to one day have the villagers build their own solar light, and teach other villages to do it, too. </p>
</div>
<div>Then, of course, there's logistics. It take over 5 hours to reach these remote villages by 4WD, and often there are not even roads leading to them, and we'll literally have to build an impromptu bridge to reach the village to begin with. </div>

<h3>About Incitement &amp; Liter of Light</h3>
<p><b>Incitement</b> is a global movement with establishments in <b>over 40 countries</b>, and aims to <b>promote volunteerism and social impact</b> amongst youth. Incitement organizes TEDx-like events. But rather than sharing ideas, we encourage taking action upon those ideas for the betterment of humanity.</p>
<p>During Incitement events we provide attendees ways to find  meaningful projects and NGO's to put their inspiration into assertive action. At the same time we help NGO's raise funds and do better marketing to amplify and expedite the impact they create in society. We have worked with 1000's of refugees in Malaysia, youths, and done social business development projects, humanitarian relief work, worked with the homeless, and much more.  </p>

A brief history
This project is not some idea, crazy dream, or brain fart. We have done this project multiple times in the past year in Malaysia, and have seen incredible impact:

  The Impact With your support we will be able to 'light up' 2 entire villages in rural Malaysia, and give them a Christmas like never before. 
Here's what we can do with your financial support:


Light up 2 villages, 100+ families, and 1250 underprivileged people will have access to this basic need. 


200 student volunteers will participate and experience what it is like to participate in meaningful projects

Safety hazards in the village will be significantly reduced (e.g. no more need for campfires inside the house)

The environment will become safer and the villagers will be less at risk to e.g. snake bites, and wild animal attacks. 

Watch the video below to see the impact create so far, we're looking to double with this campaign. 

Besides 4 years of light for the village and its inhabitants, Incitement focuses on instilling a sense of social responsibility into the mindset of the volunteers who partake in this project. It is important to get youths actively involved in volunteering initiatives like these, which is why we put a lot of focus on the experience as a volunteer as well.

We are very passionate about our designs and business and have a great group of mentors helping us overcome the challenges as they have been laid down, we have recently obtained funding to assist us with campaign perks and helping to ease the cost of manufacturing and obtain a building to get this product distributed!
