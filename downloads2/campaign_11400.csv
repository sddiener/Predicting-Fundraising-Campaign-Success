So far,  we have been able to fund the development of the project, but now we need your help to take the product further.  A successful Indiegogo campaign will fund final software and firmware updates and manufacture the first batch of Evo Go Cams. <br/><br/>More than anything, we need your support and feedback.

And using a light meter hasn’t changed either - it has always been a very inefficient process.  The photographer carries the meter into the set, takes a measurement, and then returns to fiddle with the lights or camera. And repeat. With all the advances in sensor technology and electronic design, we felt that smartphone infrastructure could be harnessed to create a new, breakthrough meter design that delivers accurate measurements with incredibly improved productivity as well.</p><p>We took that idea to photographers and filmmakers to learn more about their needs.  We brainstormed and devised a truly unique light meter.  </p><ul>
<li>We included features that would help the photographer get the right exposure and white balance faster – improving productivity on the set and reducing editing time spent fixing exposure and color issues.</li>
<li>We made the meter measure light and color, avoiding the need to buy two separate devices.</li>
<li>We separated the light sensor from the controls and display, and then replaced the controls &amp; display with a device everyone already carries - a smartphone.  That made the meter smaller, lower cost, and more convenient.</li>
<li>We also developed one of the best reasons for photographers to own a smartwatch - providing light and color readings right to your wrist.  That leaves your hands free to adjusts lights, carry your camera, interact with the talent, or whatever else you need to do.  Now the meter can even watch the light while you’re busy, warning you when something important changes.  </li>
</ul><p>The result of all this work is the Illuminati Meter: a compact device for measuring light and color.  But it really functions as your lighting assistant – helping you be more productive, more engaged with your subject. That allows you to concentrate on creating beautiful images.</p><p>Whether you create moving or still images the Illuminati light and color meter helps you measure the light in your scene – all kinds of light - efficiently and accurately. The small, lightweight meter is controlled by your smartphone using the Illuminati meter app which will be available for both Apple iOS and Android phones. Color temperature and exposure readings are transmitted from the meter to your smartphone using Bluetooth wireless technology. If you have a smartwatch paired with your smartphone, the meter readings show up there as well for a hands-free metering experience.</p><p>The meter measures exposure and color temperature from continuous sources such as LEDs, halogen, HMI, and, of course, the sun. It also measures strobes, giving you the correct exposure and color temperature - and it will even measure strobe duration. It also has a strobe + ambient mode to help you balance the exposure and also the color of the light. You can also connect multiple Illuminati meters to your smartphone and monitor multiple light simultaneously.</p><p>The illuminati light and color meter also offers several convenient mounting options including a ¼-20 socket, a lanyard channel, and a rare-earth magnet on the back which can be used with to mount the meter directly to metal objects, or with the set of Illuminati magnetic mounting attachments.</p><p>This is the first time all these features have been available in a light metering product at such an attractive price: $249 + shipping on Indiegogo right now.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495294246/xudltxlhyzxpmrni3yws.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We’re dedicated to advancing your ability to make your vision come to life with simple, powerful imaging and exposure measurement tools. The Illuminati Wireless Meter is designed to be the most versatile light and color meter ever available. We plan to keep expanding its capabilities beyond the initial release with new app features and firmware updates. This is one gadget you won’t want to leave behind.</p><p>If you want to master photography to capture your life, adventures, or for your profession, you need to get your color and exposure right. To get those really great photos, you have to stop shooting under just the ambient light, and really take control. You can't rely on your camera’s automatic options to give the look you want. The Illuminati meter gives all the information you, the modern creator, needs. We save you time and give you the confidence to focus on what matters–your vision.</p><p>We hope you agree, and want to join us in the pursuit of amazing photos and video.

And using a light meter hasn’t changed either - it has always been a very inefficient process.  The photographer carries the meter into the set, takes a measurement, and then returns to fiddle with the lights or camera. And repeat. With all the advances in sensor technology and electronic design, we felt that smartphone infrastructure could be harnessed to create a new, breakthrough meter design that delivers accurate measurements with incredibly improved productivity as well.We took that idea to photographers and filmmakers to learn more about their needs.  We brainstormed and devised a truly unique light meter.  
We included features that would help the photographer get the right exposure and white balance faster – improving productivity on the set and reducing editing time spent fixing exposure and color issues.
We made the meter measure light and color, avoiding the need to buy two separate devices.
We separated the light sensor from the controls and display, and then replaced the controls & display with a device everyone already carries - a smartphone.  That made the meter smaller, lower cost, and more convenient.
We also developed one of the best reasons for photographers to own a smartwatch - providing light and color readings right to your wrist.  That leaves your hands free to adjusts lights, carry your camera, interact with the talent, or whatever else you need to do.  Now the meter can even watch the light while you’re busy, warning you when something important changes.  
The result of all this work is the Illuminati Meter: a compact device for measuring light and color.  But it really functions as your lighting assistant – helping you be more productive, more engaged with your subject. That allows you to concentrate on creating beautiful images.Whether you create moving or still images the Illuminati light and color meter helps you measure the light in your scene – all kinds of light - efficiently and accurately. The small, lightweight meter is controlled by your smartphone using the Illuminati meter app which will be available for both Apple iOS and Android phones. Color temperature and exposure readings are transmitted from the meter to your smartphone using Bluetooth wireless technology. If you have a smartwatch paired with your smartphone, the meter readings show up there as well for a hands-free metering experience.The meter measures exposure and color temperature from continuous sources such as LEDs, halogen, HMI, and, of course, the sun. It also measures strobes, giving you the correct exposure and color temperature - and it will even measure strobe duration. It also has a strobe + ambient mode to help you balance the exposure and also the color of the light. You can also connect multiple Illuminati meters to your smartphone and monitor multiple light simultaneously.The illuminati light and color meter also offers several convenient mounting options including a ¼-20 socket, a lanyard channel, and a rare-earth magnet on the back which can be used with to mount the meter directly to metal objects, or with the set of Illuminati magnetic mounting attachments.This is the first time all these features have been available in a light metering product at such an attractive price: $249 + shipping on Indiegogo right now.We’re dedicated to advancing your ability to make your vision come to life with simple, powerful imaging and exposure measurement tools. The Illuminati Wireless Meter is designed to be the most versatile light and color meter ever available. We plan to keep expanding its capabilities beyond the initial release with new app features and firmware updates. This is one gadget you won’t want to leave behind.If you want to master photography to capture your life, adventures, or for your profession, you need to get your color and exposure right. To get those really great photos, you have to stop shooting under just the ambient light, and really take control. You can't rely on your camera’s automatic options to give the look you want. The Illuminati meter gives all the information you, the modern creator, needs. We save you time and give you the confidence to focus on what matters–your vision.We hope you agree, and want to join us in the pursuit of amazing photos and video. Continue reading to discover all the features and capabilities of the Illuminati Meter, as well as technical specifications. You can also watch some helpful demo videos made by our team and pro-photographers who’ve had the chance to beta test the meter.

We’re excited to bring our product to you and can’t wait to see how it helps photographers and videographers around the world.""Light makes photography. Embrace light. Admire it. Love it. But above all, know light. Know it for all you are worth, and you will know the key to photography.""  — George Eastman Illuminati Meter plus Android Phone (iOS available, too!) The Illuminati meter is the world's first Bluetooth light and color meter that works wirelessly with smartphones.  Traditional light meters combine the sensor and display into one bulky device.  The Illuminati meter discards all that extra weight and keeps only the most critical parts.  Small and wireless, you place the Illuminati meter anywhere in your scene.  It sends readings in real time to your phone or smartwatch while you are free to stay behind your camera or adjust lights.The Illuminati meter can also continuously monitor the ambient lighting and color. User-programmable alarms will warn you if the brightness changes because of a cloud floating overhead or the color temperature changes during the golden hour. Always know your lighting and get more good shots under changing conditions.The Illuminati meter is also the first system to let you use multiple sensors simultaneously. You can meter foregrounds and backgrounds, set strobe ratios, or monitor and manage multiple light sources (including flash!) or large areas at the same time. Stop wasting valuable time running between lights or scene locations.You can even use your smartwatch to trigger the meters remotely, monitor readings constantly and receive critical notifications about exposure or color shifts. You can get readings continuously without ever having to take out your phone or put your camera down. We’re first to do that, too!Best of all, it’s simple to use and small.

We solved a bunch of real-world problems for visual artists, content-creators and professionalsAuto White Balance (AWB) Doesn’t Always Work(Left: Too cool, Center: Neutral, Right: Too warm)Letting the camera decide how to set white balance might sound convenient.  But when it fails, you get bad skin tones, inaccurate colors, and even different colors shot-to-shot. Instead, use the Illuminati meter to get the light’s true color temperature and set white balance correctly. Leave automatic color mishaps behind.  Stop wasting time fixing it in Photoshop® or Lightroom® by getting it right before you press the shutter button.  Wrong Exposures in Tough Lighting Conditions(Left: Overexposed (lost highlights) Right: Properly exposed)Autoexposure works fine for typical scenes. Truly creative images aren’t typical. You have to control your camera, not the other way around. Subjects like a bride in a stunning white gown next to a groom in dark tuxedo, or a model backlit or under a spotlight can cause any camera to struggle.  Measuring the light falling on your subject (incident) instead of bouncing back to the camera (reflected), will let you always nail the exposure. First time, every time.Unnatural or Unexpected Colors when Mixing Lighting(Left: Daylight only, Middle: Daylight + Tungsten, Right: Daylight plus matched color balance)A shot ruined by mixed lighting can be almost impossible to fix when editing your RAW files. If your flash doesn’t match the ambient, you’re bound to get odd shadow colors. A fill light can ruin an otherwise gorgeous golden sunset.  Use the Illuminati meter’s strobe and ambient color measuring to match your strobes to the ambient and avoid mixed color casts.  Scenes with multiple light sources or odd sources, like LEDs or fluorescent lights, can also be problematic. Measure your sources separately with the Illuminati meter and instantly know how to filter or white balance to get the look you want.  You even can use multiple meters in your scene to do it even faster.We’re also including a GEL MODE in the app to help you choose the right color correction gels, even for hard-to-match lights like LEDs.Change HappensSometimes a cloud passes before the sun, or one of your flashes stops working. If you don’t know when it happens, you may have to reshoot the photos or just plain loose the shots.  Bummer.  Avoid that with up to 15 user-programmable alarm notifications.  The app can even automatically compare readings from several meters and send you warnings of color changes, color mismatch, or changes in relative brightness.  Your Time is MoneyWhen you’re a pro, all the time spent correcting images afterwards eats into your profit. Get each shot right and spend less time correcting exposure and color.(© Tony Corbell)Setting up Lighting Ratios  Know the exposure difference between your main light and fill or background light. Measure all of them and see the difference in f-stops. It’s easy and fast to set the same ratios up again anywhere.(© Tony Corbell)Stay in the FlowSetting and checking lighting during a photoshoot can detract from the energy between a photographer and her model or clients.  Avoid those, “Hold on a sec, I have to check the lighting…” moments by having the answers in your pocket or on your wrist.  You can also quietly ask assistants to go make adjustments since you already know what to fix!  Level up as Director of PhotographyWith multiple Illuminati meters on the set, you can be behind the camera or in the video village while working with your gaffers to craft the lighting. Be the Best Gaffer on Set  If you’re handling the lights and the DP calls for adjustments for a light in an awkward place (happens, right?), you can place your meter in the sweet spot and clamber up to the light to make changes and see the results on your phone or watch.  Gel the light, adjust the power or adjust the color temperature–you’ll get all the right info, faster.Change HappensSave Time when Color Grading   When the editing is done and you’re grading your footage, you’ll appreciate the exposure and colors all being in the right place. Don’t lose any highlights or shadows to something you could have fixed on set. Measure now with Illuminati meters and spend less time gnashing your teeth during color grading.Rapid Green Screen IlluminationA badly lit green screen won’t mask out properly.  Using a grid of Illuminati meters in front of your green screen lets you get behind the lights and adjust them while seeing the results in Continuous Mode in the palm of your hand. The LEDs on the meters will show you which areas are too bright or too dark. When all the meters glow green, you’re good to go.Matching and Correcting Light Sources  You’ve got many lights on your set. They may be rented and unknown, or from different manufacturers.  Plus, not all lights are made the same (or accurately report or display their color temperature).  On top of that, many bulbs drift color temperature over time with use. Phew!With the Illuminati meter, you will measure, know and correct all your light sources to match (or tailor to taste) before rolling camera. ​Measure the brightness of both ambient and strobe lighting
Measuring modes: Tv, Av, Sv, strobe ratio priority
Strobe-to-total ratio is how much of the light comes from the strobe
 Measure color of both ambient and strobes
One meter for both types of readings
Helps you detect and correct color differences to prevent mixed lighting, or craft deliberate neutral + warm/cool lighting scenarios
Connect multiple sensors to your phone (Measure the foreground and background simultaneously with multiple meters)
Meter large areas to get uniform lighting
Measure strobe ratios (foreground/background or main/fill/hair, etc.)
Simultaneously measure color of different light sources, e.g. daylight from windows and artificial lighting
Measures color in both color temperature and chromaticity(Two Chromaticity measurements compared)  (Color temperature reading on app)
Color temperature is ideal for setting camera white balance and color correcting natural sources
Chromaticity helps you color correct artificial sources like LEDs and fluorescents, or other sources that may not emit full chroma spectrum or have a tint

Spring-loaded Retractable Dome
Dome toggles up/down much like a ballpoint pen cap
Dome up for metering people or other 3D objects and multiple light sources at same time
Dome down for metering flat objects or single light sources
Safety feature: accidental pressure on the dome will push it into meter body instead of cracking.
RGB Status Indicator LEDs on meter face
Used for displaying status information - battery warning, BLE connection status, etc.
Primarily used to display user-programmable light and color level alarms. The LEDs are a great way to check lighting conditions with even looking at your phone.
Powered by two AAA batteries
Battery life is approximately 6 months
Easy to find, easy to replace
No need to worry about charging an internal or proprietary battery
Custom Alarms warn you when lighting changesSet up to 15 different alarms per device to monitor any parameter:
ambient or strobe light level
ambient or strobe color temp
ambient or strobe chromaticity coordinates (x or y)
Set any type of limits
upper or lower limits
within a range
outside a range

Also doubles as a kickstand to support meter at an angle on a table
Hold the meter between two fingers while leaving the rest of your hand free
Offset Finger T
Like the Finger T, but better!
Rotating the top alters the angle to adjust from 90 deg to 45 deg for standing nearly vertical or at an upward angle
(Using the offset-T to tilt the meter at various angles)Alligator Clip  
Clip firmly to collars, ties, and other clothing
Clip to a hook-and-loop strap or cord

Color Temperature
Displays ambient and strobe color temperature individually
Slider to set target color temperature. Displays shows the mired color shift.
Use the button “Copy reading to target” to quickly pick a reading to use as a reference. Then compare other readings from different lights to the reference light. Good for matching lights.
Chromaticity Plot
Shows exact color coordinates of both ambient and strobe in CIE XYZ gamut (entire visible spectrum of light), with a gamut indicator triangle for sRGB
Shows not only color temperature, but magenta-green color shift (tint) between lights
Great for matching to odd lights like LEDs or fluorescents
Software Development Kit (SDK)We are planning on releasing an SDK after our backers receive their rewards so that other innovative programmers and hardware developers can do fun and interesting things with the Illuminati Meter. We’re looking forward to what is possible when more minds apply their ideas and creativity in this space.“As many things have changed in the medium of photography, the one constant element has been light. The quality and color of light in a photograph is what gives meaning and definition to the activity. The direction is what gives the photograph a sense of time and moment, and critical is the difference between the light and shadow. The light meter is still one of the most important tools for creative photographers to use in making their work. The Illuminati meter gives the photographer more information than we have ever had, and ways to use that information that we have only dreamed about.”— Dennis Keeley, Chair at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, CA“I have been promoting the need for and importance of light meters for the past twenty years. Now for the first time, there is finally a new way to measure light and color that is affordable and accurate, with cutting edge technology. Illuminati is here and I for one will use it every day.""— Tony Corbell, Photographer/Lighting Evangelist“Finally, a photographer’s tool that will change the way you work and simplify precision control with color and exposure using your smart device… the Illuminati. A tool for today’s professional image maker! Measure a range of mixed lighting from ambient to strobe but most important, a wealth of information and control at our fingertips at a reasonable cost.""— Eddie Tapp, M.Photog., MEI, Cr., API Certified Professional Photographer, Explorer of Light - Canon USA, Photoshop Hall of Fame, Certified Drone Pilot, Delkin ImageMaker, Triple Scoop Music, Coloratti - X-Rite, Legion of Lume, DJI Ambassador, Ilford Master CoachWe exhibited a preview of the Illuminati Meter at WPPI 2017.  This is our first Indiegogo, but it isn’t our first rodeo...What is ready to go?We know how to make light meters. Our sister company, Peripheral Vision, designs and sells scientific-grade light and color meters for camera image quality testing. Their products are used by dozens of the best known camera companies all over the world, including Silicon Valley giants.The Illuminati meter final mechanical design is complete. We already use the same plastics suppliers to make much larger and more complex parts. The electrical design is also complete.(Exploded view)We have working Android and Android Wear apps that all our Alpha testers love.  Also, we’ve patented some major features in the Illuminati Meter and more patents are pending. We’ve made some real breakthroughs during development, and more are on the way.What is next?When we ship the meters, the iOS version will be ready for Apple iPhone and iPad owners.Complete radio EMI/compliance testing Develop the production apps for both iOS and Android Complete production test and calibration.Why We Need your HelpWe’ve spent our own money prototyping the ideas and iterating forward to turn an idea into a real working product. But funding mass production includes making plastic molds, regulatory testing, production testing and calibration processes, retail packaging, app user interface design and coding, and more. These all come at a cost.By backing our project, we’ll have the proper funds to bring this truly innovative product to you, the people who most believe that possible is worth supporting. Please help us bring the dream to life.(Development & Production Schedule)Illuminati Instruments was founded in 2017 by Michael Okincha. Michael designed the electronics and wrote the firmware.Michael knows how to build cameras. He has worked on all types of cameras - scientific, medical, DSLRs, mobile phone cameras, security, automotive, and video conferencing systems.He worked in many technical, marketing, and management roles at companies such as Foveon, Agilent, Flextronics, and Omnivision. Michael designed and managed the first camera with Foveon's X3 sensor technology, the Sigma SD9.In 2010 Michael founded Peripheral Vision (PV), a camera design consulting business. PV has helped over sixty clients, including the largest manufacturers in Silicon Valley, develop products with cameras. PV also develops automated camera test systems. The PV team includes a broad range of skills, including hardware, firmware, software, production testing, color science, and optics.One of PV's services is camera image quality testing.  As part of that work, PV developed a line of light & color meters, including the Isolight and Puck meters. The Illuminati meter is based on that work.Rudy Guttosch was raised in a family-owned commercial photography business and spent several years in digital imaging sales and development at Hasselblad USA and its parent company in Sweden. Most recently, he worked at digital image sensor developer Foveon. He holds BS/MS degrees in Imaging Science from Rochester Institute of Technology.Tom Walker is a product designer with over 25 years experience. Now based in Asia but with extensive experience working with international clients, both Blue Chip and other projects, such as the 3Doodler.We’ve been working on this for over three years. We’re really confident we can bring this product to market and grateful for your support backing our project or even telling someone you know who loves photography, filmmaking or creating content. We appreciate you!Our pledge to you: We will communicate openly and honestly about the process with our backer community.Disclaimer: iPhone, Apple, Apple logo and Android, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom, Foveon, Agilent, Flextronics, Omnivision, Hasselblad, and 3Doodler are all registered trademarks of their respective owners.",59.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Like no other lamp, Omnio Lamp has 4 pivoting arms, built-in barn doors, 264 finest LEDs providing a staggering 4200 Lumens of professional, flicker-free light, and a CRI 98.9 for skin tones. It gives light from 4 different sides at the same time. A programmable and intuitive 12 button display enables accurate control of brightness and color temperature with ease. The lamp is portable, maneuverable and adaptable with standard tripods, holders and hooks. </p>
<p>In other words: <i>Omnio Lamp is an entire professional studio in your hands giving you endless lighting possibilities exactly where and how you need it.</i></p>

Like a laptop, you can unplug lamp with battery from adapter at any time and go. If there is no need for battery block, you can plug the adapter directly into the lamp. And, of course, you can always charge battery block separately from the lamp by plugging to adapter directly.   </p>

<p>This is our 2nd Indiegogo project. We've launched, manufactured and shipped Poze on time, as promised, so it is safe to say we've got some experience with the whole process and fulfillment.</p>
<p>As we said before, we have it. Omnio Lamp is designed, built, tested and approved. We've also successfully completed the test production run, applied for an EU Declaration of Conformity and we are ready to start production. We managed to organize a whole production process <i>at our own production facility.</i> In order to perform our test production run, last year we ordered molds for pressing all our custom shaped aluminum profiles. Plastic housing molds will be ordered before the end of the campaign. Electronic component suppliers are secured and all other preparations are done which means <i>we can fully comply with perk numbers we are offering and commit to shipment dates we have listed.</i></p>
<p>As in any serial production, the final product price is a matter of production volumes. We did everything we could do with our team. Now, <strong>we need your help to scale production and reduce costs of electronic components and plates assembly, production of aluminum and plastic parts and final assembling. </strong></p>
<p>We are confident and proud to present Omnio Lamp to you - this amazing community and invite you to back us and help put this fabulous instrument on the track for bright future. Check our awesome perks, share it with your circle of people who would benefit from having an entire studio in one single lamp, or have an eye for great design. If you have any questions or comments, do not hesitate to contact us, we'll be happy to answer. Every action counts!<br/> </p>

Please check all the details with your local authorities.</p><p> <strong>INFORMATION FOR EUROPEAN BACKERS ONLY</strong></p><p>As we all know, when ordering goods from abroad, VAT, customs duty and other fees have<br/>to be paid by the importer(you) according to local rules for each country. Your lamp will be shipped from Estonia, a member of EU. That means you will not have pay for customs duty and VAT as when receiving goods from abroad, because we have already covered it during a process of production. However, our special low prices that we are offering to you as early adopters, does not give us a possibility to cover these taxes ourselves. We have to ask you to cover them. The simplest way to do it was to add that amount to the shipping fee. So, you will find a $195 price for shipping (for standard Omnio Lamp that costs $590) instead of $60 (for shipping only).</p><p>In other words, if your lamp were arriving to you from out of EU, <b>we could avoid</b> duty and VAT, <strong>but than you would have</strong> to pay: $60 for shipping + $30 for customs duty + $135 for VAT.

It operates from 9xAA NIMH batteries. For best results use professional quality ones like ENELOOP 2500mA.  For home or not extensive use, any NIMH 2500-2700mA (GP, IKEA, etc) will do, but better is always better. DO NOT USE ALKALINE BATTERIES.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> <strong>WHAT IS YOUR REFUND POLICY?</strong></p><p>Once our project is complete, we are not able to offer refunds in accordance with Indiegogo policy. When the campaign ends, your pledges got to immediate use to ensure that funds are used as stated. </p><p><strong>5.</strong> <strong> WHAT IS THE BATTERY LIFE?</strong></p><p>With high-performance batteries, Omnio Lamp will run around 60 minutes with all 4 arms turned on at 100% brightness, or up to 4 hours with 1 arm turned on at 100% brightness.</p><p><strong>6</strong><strong>.</strong> <strong>WILL I BE CHARGED VAT/duties? INFORMATION FOR NON-EUROPEAN COUNTRIES</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, we don't have a way to verify tax/VAT obligations on pledges so any applicable duties/VAT are the sole responsibility of the backer. If you would like to check whether or not you will be charged duties/VAT at the time of receiving your reward, please contact your local post office.</p><p><strong>7.

Originally conceived as a portrait and item photography lamp, Omnio Lamp turned into the most versatile lighting instrument ever.
Like no other lamp, Omnio Lamp has 4 pivoting arms, built-in barn doors, 264 finest LEDs providing a staggering 4200 Lumens of professional, flicker-free light, and a CRI 98.9 for skin tones. It gives light from 4 different sides at the same time. A programmable and intuitive 12 button display enables accurate control of brightness and color temperature with ease. The lamp is portable, maneuverable and adaptable with standard tripods, holders and hooks. 
In other words: Omnio Lamp is an entire professional studio in your hands giving you endless lighting possibilities exactly where and how you need it.
 




Talking about us



4 pivoting arms with built-in LEDs.

FOUR pivoting arms give SOFT light from FOUR DIFFERENT sides. With 264 built-in LEDs totaling 4200 Lumens of lights, there are no more technical restrains.

Standard 1/4'' Mounting Socket.

Standard 1/4'' - 20 mounting socket enables you to place or mount a lamp directly onto standard light stands, tripods or arms. Socket is also used to attach accessories like batteries, extended 5th arm, hooks, handles and more.


 

DC adapter. Rechargeable battery block. Or BOTH.

Omnio Lamp operates from DC adapter, a rechargeable battery block, or both. Rechargeable battery block consists of our battery housing and 9xAA NIMH batteries of your choice. You don't need to take batteries out of housing to charge them. You can plug in battery block into the lamp while it is connected to an adapter.

Lamp will be operating from adapter via battery block, and batteries will be charging at the same time. Like a laptop, you can unplug lamp with battery from adapter at any time and go. If there is no need for battery block, you can plug the adapter directly into the lamp. And, of course, you can always charge battery block separately from the lamp by plugging to adapter directly.   
• Adapter input: 100-240VAC, 50/60Hz 1,4-0.7A
• Output: 15V 4A, 60W
• Optional car 12V socket cable
• Power socket standard 2.1x5.5mm
 



PORTABLE.

Lightweight and foldable Omnio Lamp stands anywhere. Fold the lamp with one hand and you are ready to go!

Made to last & impress.
Rigid metal housing. Industrial-grade plastics. Anodized aluminum hands. Stainless steel for the strength of pivoting parts and joints. Lightweight bamboo. Custom electronic systems. All made for optimal performance and great style.
 

Embraced with adapter(s).

The light is soft, almost without shadows, but in case you still need a softbox, we’ve prepared adapters for Elinchrom and Bowens standards.


Use special effects for any scenario you might have. All programs are controlled by speed (frequency), brightness and color temperature. Use filters to add different colors or to make light beam even bigger.

Stretch goals.

As a part of our stretch goals, we are developing an amazing lamp base, that will open new horizons for Omnio Lamp. We are also working on adapters for softboxes complaint with Elinchrom and Bowens standards.

Where are we in the process.




What we need & what you get.

This is our 2nd Indiegogo project. We've launched, manufactured and shipped Poze on time, as promised, so it is safe to say we've got some experience with the whole process and fulfillment.
As we said before, we have it. Omnio Lamp is designed, built, tested and approved. We've also successfully completed the test production run, applied for an EU Declaration of Conformity and we are ready to start production. We managed to organize a whole production process at our own production facility. In order to perform our test production run, last year we ordered molds for pressing all our custom shaped aluminum profiles. Plastic housing molds will be ordered before the end of the campaign. Electronic component suppliers are secured and all other preparations are done which means we can fully comply with perk numbers we are offering and commit to shipment dates we have listed.
As in any serial production, the final product price is a matter of production volumes. We did everything we could do with our team. Now, we need your help to scale production and reduce costs of electronic components and plates assembly, production of aluminum and plastic parts and final assembling. 
We are confident and proud to present Omnio Lamp to you - this amazing community and invite you to back us and help put this fabulous instrument on the track for bright future. Check our awesome perks, share it with your circle of people who would benefit from having an entire studio in one single lamp, or have an eye for great design. If you have any questions or comments, do not hesitate to contact us, we'll be happy to answer. Every action counts! 

1. PRE-ORDER one or more Omnio Lamps
2. GIVE  Omnio Lamp to someone special- you will give them an entire studio, not just a lamp!
3. SHARE the story with your friends, relatives, favorite blogs and cool people like you.
4. FOLLOW & SPREAD the word!  @omnioLamp

FAQ.1. SHIPPING, general informationWe are shipping from European Union. When ordering goods from abroad, VAT, customs/duty and other fees are paid by the importer (you) according to local rules for each country. Please check all the details with your local authorities. INFORMATION FOR EUROPEAN BACKERS ONLYAs we all know, when ordering goods from abroad, VAT, customs duty and other fees haveto be paid by the importer(you) according to local rules for each country. Your lamp will be shipped from Estonia, a member of EU. That means you will not have pay for customs duty and VAT as when receiving goods from abroad, because we have already covered it during a process of production. However, our special low prices that we are offering to you as early adopters, does not give us a possibility to cover these taxes ourselves. We have to ask you to cover them. The simplest way to do it was to add that amount to the shipping fee. So, you will find a $195 price for shipping (for standard Omnio Lamp that costs $590) instead of $60 (for shipping only).In other words, if your lamp were arriving to you from out of EU, we could avoid duty and VAT, but than you would have to pay: $60 for shipping + $30 for customs duty + $135 for VAT. Total= $225This way you save $30 and a hassle of filling several forms. 2. DOES OMNIO LAMP COME WITH RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES?Omnio Lamp comes with battery block (smart housing for rechargeable batteries), and without rechargeable batteries. You can choose witch rechargeables to use.3.  WHAT RECHARGEABLES SHOULD I USE?Omnio Lamp is a high-performance lamp, so high-performance batteries are recommended. It operates from 9xAA NIMH batteries. For best results use professional quality ones like ENELOOP 2500mA.  For home or not extensive use, any NIMH 2500-2700mA (GP, IKEA, etc) will do, but better is always better. DO NOT USE ALKALINE BATTERIES.4. WHAT IS YOUR REFUND POLICY?Once our project is complete, we are not able to offer refunds in accordance with Indiegogo policy. When the campaign ends, your pledges got to immediate use to ensure that funds are used as stated. 5.  WHAT IS THE BATTERY LIFE?With high-performance batteries, Omnio Lamp will run around 60 minutes with all 4 arms turned on at 100% brightness, or up to 4 hours with 1 arm turned on at 100% brightness.6. WILL I BE CHARGED VAT/duties? INFORMATION FOR NON-EUROPEAN COUNTRIESUnfortunately, we don't have a way to verify tax/VAT obligations on pledges so any applicable duties/VAT are the sole responsibility of the backer. If you would like to check whether or not you will be charged duties/VAT at the time of receiving your reward, please contact your local post office.7. WHEN WILL I RECEIVE OMNIO LAMP?This is our second campaign and we are confident in our own production facility and suppliers, but short delays can always appear. Some machine can break or components can be stuck on customs for a week or two. No matter that Omnio Lamp is a complex product, our test production run was performed flawlessly. We'll keep you informed about progress with full transparency.We are using one of the world's best international shipping carriers that provide door-to-door delivery with full tracking.  It usually takes them from 3 to 10 days for delivery anywhere.You can expect to get your lamp during a month specified in the perk.",128.0,1,"2 Campaigns

中文介紹 中文教學 日本語版YoCam is the smartest, lightest, and affordable all-in-one digital camera.














It's time to ditch your GoPro, DropCam, NestCam, dash cams, selfie cameras, and other life-logging cameras because the YoCam does it all and does it the best.













Designed and engineered to be the last line of cameras you'll ever need.

It's light weight, powerful, versatile, waterproof & most importantly - affordable.




YoCam weighs only 2 ounces (~ 55 grams) without sacrificing any functionality.










Designed to be versatile,  YoCam can do it.









With an IP68 rating, YoCam is waterproof up to 20 foot deep without an additional housing unit.




Whether you're capturing summer moments splashing in the sun or you accidentally drop YoCam into your pool - you can rest assured knowing its safe.












One of the best features of YoCam is its ability to remain stable in unstable environments. Using MoSteady™ stabilization technology, HDR and a P2P remote internet connection, you can see the YoCam difference for yourself: 







Designed to be a user-friendly as possible, you can easily take selfies with the click of an easy-to-reach button. Forget DSLRs and smartphone cameras - YoCam has a 140° super-wide angle, fixed focus lens for optimal group shots.










With the Mofily smartphone app, you can edit your YoCam photos and videos without ever touching a laptop or desktop PC. Generations of memories can be captured, edited, and published in just minutes. 








GoPros give you the fisheye and SLRs give you extra weight (for those cards, battery packs, chargers, cables, covers, etc.) - but with YoCam, you just GO!





By using the Life-Log preset mode, you can simply press and hold the shutter for 2 seconds and YoCam will automatically capture a frame every few seconds - documenting your hike, swim, or journey while you focus on what matters most.







""Good things come in small packages"" and the same goes for YoCam. 
Even at its small and portable form factor it contains a powerful camera system that can record 2.7K HD footage at 30 frames per second. 
Featuring burst shots, delayed shots, slow motion and time lapses - YoCam was designed to accompany you on all of your adventures. 
Set it and forget it, so you can remember it later. 






 




In an effort to keep your digital life as simple as possible, we're introducing the One-Click Photo Book that works in tandem with our Mofily app. 
Simply pick a collection of photos taken with your YoCam, press the One-Click Photo Book option, and a customized hard-copy photo book will be delivered directly to your front door.










Whether you're outdoor adventurer or an indoor pioneer, YoCam lets you easily share your moments with loved ones and to stay connected. 
Check in your baby from thousands of miles away or send a quick hello to grandma with YoCam!














Use YoCam to record every mile of your drive and to have an extra 'eye' on the road. Access video mode, press and hold the shutter for 2 seconds, and YoCam will start recording 5 to 10 minutes worth of looping footage. 
Insurance agents will love you!







YoCam is powerful on its own, but additional accessories can aid in expanding versatility and the possibilities of your imagination. 
Here are just a few:



Remotely operate your YoCam with ease through our dedicated Bluetooth Remote.





Wear YoCam around your neck and keep the lightweight camera a click away.

<p style=""text-align: center;color:#888;"">That's <span style=""font-weight: bold;font-size: 20px;color:#00a99d;"">the initial idea</span> where our long journey has began from.<br/>After all the efforts in developing the camera,<br/>finally we made it and decided to call it a <strong style=""color:#333;"">'SMART CAM'</strong> rather than an action cam.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;color:#333;"">So, why 'Smart cam'?</h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;color:#888;"">ㅡ</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Before we find the answer to the question, let's get started with asking you some other questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you still <strong>connect your cams to PC or mobile</strong> in order to save and edit videos?</li>
<li>Have you ever<strong> forgotten to bring SD card </strong>for your camera when you're on traveling?</li>
<li>Do you want to get rid of all the <strong>complicated set-ups</strong> before you do a <strong>live stream</strong>?</li>
</ul>
<p>If your answer is 'YES' for any of these questions, we strongly recommend you to try our smart cam.</p>

<p>Our smart cam, VUEcam is a kind of <span style=""color:#00a99d;""><strong>a hybrid camera</strong></span> that is positioned <strong>between an action cam and a smartphone.</strong> Our team has been making every efforts in finding the best way to get advantages of both types of devices and VUEcam is the result.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;color:#333;"">How does VUEcam differ from the existing action cams?</h4>
<p> </p>
<p>Nowadays, many people are using action cams in their daily lives for various purposes, but sometimes we find that it's better to use a smartphone as action cams are not yet smart.</p>
<p>Here are key points that explain <strong>why VUEcam is smarter than the existing action cams.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517210422/ogqombnb949h0cv0volm.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;color:#fff;"">Compared to normal action cams, <strong>the smart cam makes things easier.</strong><br/>Data transferring and screen sharing are also done simple and quick.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;color:#fff;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517214521/sowymufgsd3rqwpminhd.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><br/>One of substantial merits of action cams which smartphones still can't compete with would be an <strong>'angle of view'. </strong>The angle of view between two devices normally differ by 50 degrees.</p>
<p>Then, what does the difference affect? That is the amount of your memory and your trace.</p>
<p style=""color: #00a99d;"">A wider range of the angle memorizes more things of you.</p>

<p>Except for that, all the kinds of mounts from GoPro's, Soni's or any other brands' in the market are compatible since VUEcam has <strong>a standard size of mount hole. </strong></p>

""What happens if there's an action cambased on Android OS?""
ㅡ
That's the initial idea where our long journey has began from.After all the efforts in developing the camera,finally we made it and decided to call it a 'SMART CAM' rather than an action cam.
 
 
So, why 'Smart cam'?
ㅡ
 
Before we find the answer to the question, let's get started with asking you some other questions.

Do you still connect your cams to PC or mobile in order to save and edit videos?
Have you ever forgotten to bring SD card for your camera when you're on traveling?
Do you want to get rid of all the complicated set-ups before you do a live stream?

If your answer is 'YES' for any of these questions, we strongly recommend you to try our smart cam.
 
 
Life is logging

It's VUEcam.
 

 
Our smart cam offers a number of functions to enhance its performance and convenience to us ㅡ those who are very much familiar with smartphones.
 
 

How Different
ㅡ

Our smart cam, VUEcam is a kind of a hybrid camera that is positioned between an action cam and a smartphone. Our team has been making every efforts in finding the best way to get advantages of both types of devices and VUEcam is the result.
 
How does VUEcam differ from the existing action cams?
 
Nowadays, many people are using action cams in their daily lives for various purposes, but sometimes we find that it's better to use a smartphone as action cams are not yet smart.
Here are key points that explain why VUEcam is smarter than the existing action cams.
 




Easy Data Share
ㅡ
 
Compared to normal action cams, the smart cam makes things easier.Data transferring and screen sharing are also done simple and quick.


 
 
Then, why don't we just use a smartphone?
 

One of substantial merits of action cams which smartphones still can't compete with would be an 'angle of view'. The angle of view between two devices normally differ by 50 degrees.
Then, what does the difference affect? That is the amount of your memory and your trace.
A wider range of the angle memorizes more things of you.
 

 
Except for that, all the kinds of mounts from GoPro's, Soni's or any other brands' in the market are compatible since VUEcam has a standard size of mount hole. 
 

 
 
How It Works
ㅡ
 

Having a VUEcam means you are able to do many things.
Recording good memories with your friends and family, shooting some beautiful natural sceneries while riding, doing a live stream to share your story on YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, even monitoring your baby during labour and preventing unforeseen events. ㅡ All of these are possible.
Our versatile VUEcam will help you keep your unforgettable moments much longer and share with others quickly and easily ever.
 
 
Fast and convenient
Live Streaming
ㅡ

Rather than enduring a complicated setup process to broadcast live, all you need to do is just preparing a VUEcam and Wi-Fi. Simplifying the procedure will save your time and effort.
 

Real-time broadcasting is easily and effortlessly performed using our own app or other video platforms such as Facebook, Vimeo and YouTube on the camera.

 
Live streaming is proceeded through our streaming solution named 'VUE Streaming Engine'. VUEcam app directly connects to our streaming server on Wowza and the streaming server is also capable of combining it with some of popular platforms such as facebook, instagram and youtube. Enjoy live streaming anytime, anywhere.
Please check out our live streaming demos.

 

 
 
 
better experience with
Application
ㅡ

We have been developing our own applications for both VUEcam and android phone. We will release the android app in Google Play store soon on the upcoming April.
 
 


By using the android app, you can easily control VUEcam on your smartphone. It's available to record with the preview mode, see files in a gallery and change settings on the app.
If you're an iOS user, please wait a moment until the iOS version is released. However, you're still able to control VUEcam directly on the cam.
 

 
 
Launcher
ㅡ

To make VUEcam users have better UI/UX, We also have been working hard to make a good launcher. Gathering any ideas and opinions from our users is always welcome.
 

It's highly expandable.
Need more functional apps? Visit our 'VUE Store'. (Launching soon)
We will provide other kinds of apps such as Editor / GPS / Tracker / IP Cam for VUEcam users.

You don't need to move your best shots for editing anymore. Just open your photos and videos in editor apps on the device. Getting GPS, tracking while doing workouts is also available. In addition, VUEcam could be an IP cam for monitoring your baby and pet at home or a black box in a car.

When you go for water sports like swimming and scuba diving or when it rains, the housing will protect your VUEcam safe and keep it useful.
 

 
Where the fund goes
ㅡ
We've done prototyping and the 1st pilot production until now. At the moment, we're looking forward to achieving the goal in this funding and maximize our customers' efficiency and happiness through our product.

Most of the funding (60%) will go for a mass production and setting up facilities of VUEcam and the others will be used for shipping (from packaging design to delivery) and fees for marketing and IndieGogo commission.

It can recognize reappearing faces, distinguish between human intruder and pet movement without triggering false alarm. Features 1080p full HD, 2-way audio and Wifi connectivity, SimCam has everything you expect in an AI security camera. All data is stored locally without the need to pay Cloud storage fees, no 3rd party can ever access to your information, putting your mind at ease.
 Because SimCam records video to local storage, you’ll have easy access to your footage from your smartphone and set you free from Cloud storage costs. Take a look at a comparison between Simcam and the others.
 
  SimCam is the world’s only camera provides 100% secured privacy to your families with our Offline mode function. SimCam will still running real-time analysis and only trigger video recording when there is an event triggered. You can also sync videos to your home NAS system and no one can access the data or watch the livestream.   
Built-in Intel AI VPU, SimCam record and analyze images locally, which makes you spend nothing on cloud services. All data can be saved to a up to 128GB Micro-SD card (buy separately) and supports sync to local NAS storage, privacy and stability are guaranteed.
 
 The Intel® Movidius™ 12 cores VPU, a tenfold increase in the processing speed with the powerful deep neural network, enabling real-time image analyzing and multi-tasking with the greatest precision. A SimCam engineering prototype shows how human detection function works.Fed up with the false alerts sent by your outdated Passive Infrared security system? With AI computer vision chip, SimCam can distinguish human, animal or moving trees with its movement detection technology; a video of 15 seconds, including 7 seconds before and 8 seconds after the sensor is triggered is auto recorded, in-App notification will promptly send to you.   A SimCam engineering prototype shows how the facial recognition function works.We respect your friends and family as you do and their faces are worth remembering. That’s why we integrate Intel deep learning technology to SimCam for you to register trusted faces, you can also opt out the App notification for their appearance.  

SimCam marks the beginning of your smart home revolution, in the above video, we are going to show you how SimCam recognize a pre-set family member and turn on the lights, fan or even TV (use together with SimCam smart plug).
 
Not like other products on the market can only start recording by waking up the camera after a while, which will easily miss important moment. SimCam features 10 seconds of pre-event and 20 seconds of post-event recording (30 seconds in total), allows you to easily review what motion events are causing the system to record instantly. 
  A SimCam engineering prototype shows how the object monitoring function works.SimCam features object monitoring, it allows you to outline the object you want to be supervised via its app; the camera records when the motion is triggered by an occurrence, it will also send a notification to your phone.   

We will open source software development kit (SDK) and the source code to the public through website and GITHUB. Developers can DIY their desired AI functions, such as catching your dog from stealing food on the table (as shown on above video), or identifying their own license plates and opening the garage door among other AI functions.
 
SimCam is creating an ultimate clear vision no matter anytime, anywhere.
 SimCam can livestream video via our app. SimCam records 24/7 in 1080p full HD video, 360-degree gimbal with 100-degree field of view (FOV) and you can easily access to live streaming in the Simcam app, and you can easily access to live streaming in the SimCam app.

Here is a video shows how the gimbal works once it's triggered.
 
 
SimCam's night vision.

<p>Back on 26th, October 2015, we  launched a successful Indiegogo campaign for the original SLOPES, the world’s first polyhedron stand for GoPro cameras (HERO 3/3+/4). With its brand new structure composed of a polyhedron bottom and a multi-direction slot, the original SLOPES provides 20 different angles to position a case-free GoPro camera in a matter of seconds.</p>

<h3>What's New</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Today, the GoPro HERO has evolved  to the 7th generation , which original red SLOPES no longer fits . Although in 2016 we had launched  another awesome edition - SLOPES Black which is compatible with almost all in-case/frame GoPro cameras (HERO 7/6/5/4/3+) , there are still many people hope we bring a new edition to enable their case/frame-free using. Furthermore, some people suggested to include a 15°-20° angled surface on SLOPES to fully leverage GoPro’s Superview and Wide and Linear mode.. Now SLOPES Elite makes it happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>16 Killer Angles</h3>

<p>For a wide angle camera like GoPro, the composition is absolutely a tough work if you compare it to the iPhone shooting. However, when you got the right composition on such a wide angle camera, a bursting visual impact will emerge and catch the eyeball.

<p>The special design has made the composition process much more efficient.  Either your GoPro field of view is set to Superview or Wide or Linear, you can always find an angle to get the horizontal line in the right position, which is one of the key to form a nice composition on wide angle camera.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hey everyone this is Kevin Davidson of K|D Imagery we're excited and delighted to bring before you this opportunity to partner with us. As a young photographer I believe our gifts and talents should serve for a purpose far greater than that of ourselves. This is the reason why the staff of K|D Imagery has decided to partner with Bishop AR Hibbert Sr. along with his ministry staff to document this historical event.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Now our mission is to raise awareness for the needs of missionaries and for the people of Sri Lanka. Through our medium of photography and imagery, we would like to capture the story of lives which have been transformed through selfless giving. By your participation, you can help to create exposure so that these needs can be met. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All K|D Imagery asks is that you can help us with a donation of $15. This donation will go to helping us send our photographer to document this missions trip in Sri Lanka. IN NO WAY will our photographer be paid for this event, we believe in donating our time and effort to this cause. We are only raising money for airfare. I believe that TOGETHER we can make an impact through this campaign! <br/><br/>All of our partners in this Sri Lanka Experience will receive a 12 month 12 x 18in. ""Sri Lanka Experience"" calendar, along with a personal slideshow of this missions trip. This is our way of saying THANK YOU for your help and amazing support! In advance we thank you for your love and participation!! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
Hey everyone this is Kevin Davidson of K|D Imagery we're excited and delighted to bring before you this opportunity to partner with us. As a young photographer I believe our gifts and talents should serve for a purpose far greater than that of ourselves. This is the reason why the staff of K|D Imagery has decided to partner with Bishop AR Hibbert Sr. along with his ministry staff to document this historical event.


The Impact
Now our mission is to raise awareness for the needs of missionaries and for the people of Sri Lanka. Through our medium of photography and imagery, we would like to capture the story of lives which have been transformed through selfless giving. By your participation, you can help to create exposure so that these needs can be met. 


What We Need & What You Get
All K|D Imagery asks is that you can help us with a donation of $15. This donation will go to helping us send our photographer to document this missions trip in Sri Lanka. IN NO WAY will our photographer be paid for this event, we believe in donating our time and effort to this cause. We are only raising money for airfare. I believe that TOGETHER we can make an impact through this campaign! All of our partners in this Sri Lanka Experience will receive a 12 month 12 x 18in. ""Sri Lanka Experience"" calendar, along with a personal slideshow of this missions trip. This is our way of saying THANK YOU for your help and amazing support! In advance we thank you for your love and participation!!

<h3>My Story</h3>I started studying photography when I was in high school. I found a teacher who was an incredible mentor and helped me deal with the depression of my mom's death in 1999. I learned everything that I could and spent most of my days out shooting countless rolls of film, developing them, and seeing what I came up with in the dark room. Photography became my hobby as well as something that made life more beautiful. Everything looks different through a lens. I would not be who I am without picking up this hobby. Sometimes I feel like my life's purpose is to show other people how beautiful the world can be and capture moments for them so that they will never forget. Photography makes me feel like my life is important, I like that.<br/><br/>I sold my car and moved to Omaha, NE in January of 2008 after learning of my home's foreclosure in California to see what else the world had to offer me. Through a huge amount of support, I was able to start photographing ""professionally"" in the fall of 2010. At this same time, I reentered school and am currently studying for a BS in Environmental Studies. That means that I do equal parts chemistry and biology.. and lots of it. Lately, I have been feeling the limitations of my equipment and would like to be able to expand creatively and professionally. Unfortunately, due to school, my funds are very limited so I am reaching out.<br/><br/>I am a natural light photographer and take many family and individual portraits but I would like to expand my creative side too. I have a few projects in the works and would like to build on those in addition to building a larger client base. I have an end goal of showing a few collections but those also take a great deal of money to put together.<br/><br/>I also have hopes of establishing an in-home studio for winter months. This would be completely new to me and a direction I am very curious about.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>The impact of my campaign reaches to everyone that I photograph. By helping me now, you are helping to receive better quality photos in the future. I do have high hopes of one day publishing the few collections that I'm working on but I want them to have a vast number of photos before releasing them to the public. <br/><br/>The largest impact would be on me. As selfish as that feels to say, photography has been my happy place and creative outlet for over 10 years. I've struggled with anxiety my whole life and photography has helped me to overcome a large deal of it. My camera is my safety blanket and I feel that new equipment would help to rekindle my love for it and also provide a new challenge.<br/><br/><br/>

What is the most important thing for a dash cam?
Is it feasible to add more functions to turn a dash cam into a smart vehicle security system? 
Can we produce a dash cam that allows people to choose the functions they need?
We created LetownThe real 4K starlight night vision smart modular vehicle security system. MEET Letown LT9Real 4K Definition, Perfectly Captures Every Detail 
GoPro's aspherical lenses
3.0' LCD Screen
F1.4 Diaphragm
OV4689 Image Sensor 
Novatek NT96663 Chip 
7 Groups of Glass Lenses
  With these top configurations, Letown is able to1. record in 2160P true 4K cinematic video quality;2. produce the high-quality image when recording against the light; and3. provide real 166° wide angle (the so-called 170° wide angle lenses on the market are actually only 120°). 1. High-quality ImageLetown has an storage of 128 GB that ensures maximum 20-hour 4K video recording. Once the memory card is full, it overwrites the oldest unlocked video clips in order to keep uninterrupted monitoring for you. Of course, in addition to automatically locking videos of unexpected incidents, users can also click on the button any time to permanently save any video they like (such as the beautiful scenery on the road).2. Superb Night Vision3. Super Wide-angle LensWith 166° ultra-wide-angle all-glass lens, monitoring from all directions, no blind spots with Letown. Enjoy your journey with Letown's highly sensitive, accurate and detailed capture recordings.Demo VideoDemo Video What makes Letown differentAfter long-term research, our team discovered the power supply scheme of using capacitors rather than the lithium batteries.  Letown is absolutely safe and durable.Capacitor power supply & OBD power cable  Features
 Dual-channel Recording
 ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistant Systems)
24-hour Smart Parking Monitor
GPS Path Tracing
Easy Setup
Durability
User-friendly software
Selfie Mode
1. Dual-channel RecordingLetown supports dual-channel recording, allowing the dash cam to capture footage from the front camera while simultaneously recording from its SONY IMX323 1080P rear camera attachment. This setup allows you to capture both ends of the road, and videos taken by the rear camera are stored alongside those from the front camera on the memory card for easy access. With simple wiring, it can be set up in 5 minutes, monitoring the car from every direction. 2. ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistant Systems) The Letown LT9 provides real-time intelligent lane departure warnings. Equipped with Collision Warning, the camera detects the distance of the front and rear car for further safety precautions.3. 24-hour Smart Parking Monitor Auto switch to parking mode when you park your car. Triggered by the motion detector, the dash cam will automatically record when people or things come closer to your car, and automatically power off if nothing happens after 30 seconds. It decreases the load on the dash cam, car battery and memory card to the greatest extent possible and effectively extends the service life (powered by OBD power cable, automatic protection for battery under 11.6V low voltage). Radar ModuleParking Monitor Mode 4. GPS Path Tracing, Real-Time LocationThe GPS module helps you accurately assess the status of the accident by providing you with the vehicle speed, the direction of the collision and the severity of impact. At the same time, you can always use the JMSGPSPlayer navigation software (install from CD or download from official website) to locate and trace your car path.GPS ModuleJMSGPSPlayer Navigation Software5. Easy SetupLetown LT9 can be installed within 10 minutes, even if you have never used a dash cam.6. DurabilityLetown uses heat-resistant polymer materials for the suction cups of the mounts to prevent the front and rear cameras from dropping off.  7. User-friendly softwareAnyone can easily learn to use Letown's software with its meticulously designed simple interface. 7. Selfie ModeIn fact, our team also thought about another function of Letown — selfie. We designed a 360° rotatable camera mount to turn LT9 into selfie mode that catches your joyful moments on the road with friends.360° Rotatable Camera Mount For 15 months, from a simple idea to the original design, testing, prototypes and then to the final working product... we made Letown LT9, the real 4K starry night vision smart modular vehicle security system.Comparison with similar items Why Letown? Rewards Development About UsLetown Corporation is a dash camera manufacturer and exporter in Hong Kong.

Attach facing forwards to block out unwanted glare and reflections when shooting through a window, or fit backwards to protect your equipment from the elements.The 60mm diameter for the ULH refers to your lens BODY size, NOT the filter size. If you have a 58mm filter, then you will want the full size ULH as the lens body will be larger.  What does it do?Removing glare by day and reflections by night, the ULH can be used any time you need it. Whether you're shooting through a hotel window, a high-rise observation deck, the window of a bus or through an enclosure at the zoo - the ULH makes a massive difference, transforming a bad photo into a great one even before you start editing!   

Fits to your lens, rather than attaching to the glass. This means you're free to move around, change your angle and adjust your camera settings without having to detach anything. 

Leaves no marks on the window. This'll keep you on the good side of venue managers and their staff! The ULH is made of silicone, and is designed to rest against the glass, rather than attach to it.

Perfect for crowded areas. Often the busiest tourist attractions leave very little room - or time - for great images. With the ULH on your lens, you take up no more room than you would normally, but your photos will come out better than anyone else's.

  Who is it for?The ULH is a must-have accessory for photographers, filmmakers, and travellers alike. It's one of those things that while you may not use it every day, it'll earn its place in your bag in no time at all. If you've ever wanted landscape photos through a window, a time-lapse of take off and landing, or the perfect shot of a tiger at the zoo - the Ultimate Lens Hood is for you. (unintentional rhyme there.)   How do I use it?The ULH can be used freehand or on a tripod.

I have developed it through several iterations to arrive on what I fully believe to be the best combination of size, stretchiness and toughness for it to truly live up to the title of Ultimate Lens Hood.  Made from a compression moulded silicone, the initial tooling for the full size ULH is already paid for and complete. There are a few minor modifications I am planning to make. The first is to make the outer brim a little chunkier - this will help it hold its shape a bit better, and the second is to add in the ULH branding marks. The ULHmini tooling will be started during the campaign!   One of the early discoveries was the colour: The ULH has to be black. Any other colour gives a horribly tinted vignette as it reflects the light and changes the colour of your photos. Black doesn't reflect any light, and therefore doesn't vignette or tint. Simples!   So that's pretty much everything I think there is to say on the ULH! As I said in the video, I am really pleased with this product and am super excited to get production started. This is far from my first Kickstarter campaign, and will definitely not be the last either!    If you have any questions, please message me directly or comment on the campaign and I will do my best to get back to you as soon as I can! If there are frequent questions, I will add to the FAQ. So now you've seen the full campaign...If you like the ULH please pick your pledge tier from the options above and share the campaign with everyone you know! I need your help to get this funded, and into the hands of filmmakers and photographers all round the world. Thank you for reading to the end, and thank you for your support :)   For near-daily updates, behind the scenes content and more example images, follow @the_ULH on Instagram :)
  RIP to the bravest tripod I ever knew. I might have gone a BIT excessive with that spray. ULH took it like a champ, camera was totally unharmed.

<p>My name is Emanuele, I’m 36, I’m married, and I’m the dad of one beautiful baby boy. My wife Romana and I are keen travellers and enthusiast photographers - in 2010 we set off on our first around the world trip and started our travel and photography blog, which you can see here: <a href=""http://www.thesiracusas.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Siracusas's Travel and Photography Blog"">www.thesiracusas.com</a> </p>
<p>Although photography is not our first job, we make some money from it and we expect our income stream from photography to increase steadily in the near future. </p>
<p>Some of our <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/stolenfant/sets/72157629311123280/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Tearsheets"">travel photography work</a> has ended up on several publishing outlets, including a travel magazine, the Daily Mail online, and the National Geographic stock. In 2011 I received an honourable mention at the PX3, Prix de la Photographie, Paris. We also do occasional jobs as photographers for a local marketing agency and we’ve covered several local events as freelance photographers. </p>
<h3>Why this campaign?</h3>
<p>One month ago thieves broke into our home and stole our gear. The  camera insurance we bought in Ireland before we set off on our extended trip expired a few months ago and we were still looking to find a suitable insurer here in Italy. So we weren't covered and fate intervened.</p>
<p>Apart from the shock of having been robbed, I don't know which broke our hearts more: the loss of the master files of 99% of our <a href=""http://www.thesiracusas.com/photography/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Emanuele Siracusa's Travel Photography Portfolio"">travel photography portfolio</a>, or the actual financial damage, at a time when we can't afford to buy new cameras, lenses and computers. I<span>n any case, we didn't sleep for nights afterwards.</span></p>
<p>A month has passed and even though we’ve tried everything, the chances of getting our stuff back now are pretty much nonexistent.</p>
<p>Photography is our life passion, and we are working hard towards making it into a full time job. Now with the new responsibilities of bringing up our baby boy, the hit is even more unfortunate, and we need all the help we can get. </p>
<p>A couple of friends pointed us to Indiegogo and encouraged us to start a campaign to try to recover some of the cost of buying new gear before we hit the market. We were a bit doubtful at first but then we asked another bunch of friends and they all thought starting this campaign was a good idea, given the woeful situation we’re in. </p>
<h3>How much you're trying to raise?</h3>
<p>Apart from our laptops, the hard disks where our photos were stored, and some camera accessories like memory cards, replacement batteries, chargers and filters, this is what we’ve lost-</p>

<li>Canon Speedlite 580 EX II</li>

</ul><p>Now, the whole damage amounts to <strong>the equivalent of about $8000</strong>, and although it would be great to <strong>raise the whole the amount</strong> through this campaign, <strong>we’re starting at $3000</strong> which would be enough to buy a second hand full frame camera and perhaps a decent general purpose lens to live with for a while (I do need to factor in Indiegogo's and PayPal fees).</p>
<h3>What do I get?</h3>
<p>In exchange for your help we’re giving out some of our prints (look at the perks on the sidebar for more details) and hopefully this will make it worthwhile for you.

There are some cool companies that will place small versions of Instagram images on different promo items like magnets, 4"" x 4"" metal frames and nifty photo books. HINT: If I reach my stretch goals and then get over-funded, I will unlock new perks that will include prints shot with the new camera!!! Fingers crossed!

</div></div>","*Huge thanks and love to all who have contributed! :)  You can still help me and contribute as long as you see the status of my campaign as ""InDemand"", I have raised $862 of an $1199 stretch goal to fund a portrait lens. With your help, I can make this happen! Just select your perk and ""check out""

STRETCH GOAL: PORTRAIT LENS. 71% FUNDED, $862 raised so far, $337 needed!




My stretch goal is the portrait-length Zeiss Batis 85mm f/1.8 Lens which features maximum aperture for greater focus control and enhanced low-light shooting.  As long as you see the status of my campaign as ""InDemand"" we can still meet this goal and I thank you in advance for your consideration, contributions as well as for continuing to share my campaign with your communities! 

I want you to know that even if we don't reach this goal that 100% of the contributions that I receive will all go towards my photography equipment goals so let's see what can be accomplished with half a month's time! Even if I can make it half way there that would be incredible as it would greatly expedite my journey to owning this amazing tool and getting to work with it :) - Jeremy

<span>COSYSPEED GmbH is a German based brand and the first company in the world that is focused exclusively on accessories for mirrorless cameras. In 2014 COSYSPEED launched its first product the ""CAMSLINGER 160 Camera Bag for Mirrorless Cameras"". COSYSPEEDS philosophy is to develop innovative products for photographers and on the other side support actively development aid projects. The first product from this approach is the <a href=""http://www.cosyspeed.com/product/campillow/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CAMPILLOW</a>, made in a project in Burundi (and presumably the first photo product made in Africa).</span><br/>

To be able to do that we need your support in this campaign, because our financial situation needs to be more stable to do this turn. So come with us and create something NEW in an industry that cares for one of the most passionable things in the world – photography! </span></p><div>

To launch the CAMSLINGER Streetomatic, we simply do not have the funds, nevertheless we invested already a good amount of the profits from the first product into the development of the CAMSLINGER Streetomatic. The Streetomatic is tested by many involved photographers and now ready for production. We just need your support to realize this amazing bag! </span></p><div>

FAQ



Are you a street or travel photographer? Do you like hiking or walking around in cities for many hours with your beloved camera? Do you want to have your camera always ready within a second for the next photo – just as quick as a sling strap but with the safety of a bag?The CAMSLINGER Streetomatic is a new and unique Camera Bag Concept that is super Quick, super Safe and super Comfy. It was originally designed for Mirrorless Cameras, but you can of course use a CAMSLINGER Streetomatic for your small or mid-sized DSLR or Superzoom Camera. You can wear it super comfy at the hip or over your shoulder.

Outdoor Photographers
Wedding Photographers

FOR WHAT GEAR IS A CAMSLINGER STREETOMATIC?

Mirrorless Cameras
DSLRs
Superzoom Cameras
Action Cameras
Lenses (when using a sling strap for your cam)
Travel Stuff 


Do you use a sling strap?
Many photographers use a sling strap. You too? Are you amazed by the speed of the one-handed access to your camera? But on the other side you would wish to have your gear safe against rain and bumps when not in use? Then the CAMSLINGER Streetomatic is the perfect solution for you!




















The 1-hand/1-second concept

When you use a CAMSLINGER Streetomatic you can access your camera super quick. Just move your hand intuitively to the bag at your hip, open it, grab the cam and take your picture - all with one hand and within a second.



1) Open your CAMSLINGER Streetomatic with one hand2) Grab your camera3) Draw your camera and take your photo








 In a CAMSLINGER Streetomatic your gear is safe against rain, bumps, dust and the view of strangers. The bag is made out of robust, durable and water resistant Nylon D600 fabrics that will last for a long period of use. And for those cases when you have to walk through heavy rain for hours, you can use the included rain cover. This will give you the absolute safe feeling, that your gear is well protected. 
Raincover in use and attached to the belt

To keep the CAMSLINGER as slim as possible, we use robust but thin PE plates as a padding instead of the traditional thicker foam material. 


Safety against dropping – the FINGERCAMSTRAP
 To have your camera safe against accidential dropping and at the same time ready without delay (as you would have a delay when attaching a strap around your neck or wrist) we developped the FINGERCAMSTRAP. It comes free with every CAMSLINGER Streetomatic and is easily attachable without any loss of time.
No limitation when operating your camera Attach intuitively and without any loss of time when grabing your camera




A CAMSLINGER Streetomatic is super comfy to wear even the whole day long. When used at the hip, your back is free of any weight! When used as a sling bag over your shoulder, you still have all the features like the quick, one-handed access.

The CAMSLINGER has a fixed belt and is free movable around your hip.


Carrying position of the CAMSLINGER Streetomatic is low on the thigh. Hence it is super intuitively accessible and the weight of your gear is super comfy on your thigh.


 

Included accessory bags for spare batteries, SD cards and your phone are super comfy to access.






 
In a CAMSLINGER Streetomatic you can carry what you need for a day out shooting: a camera, one, two, three lenses, spare batteries, small accessories and your phone. All super quick accessible but safely stored when not in use. And it is super comfy for many hours.




  

The CAMSLINGER Streetomatic

Thomas Leuthard Edition Thomas Leuthard is one of the most influental street photographers of our times. The Edition bag comes in whole black with a stitching of Thomas signature on the front. Thomas relinquishes to all profits of the Edition and so from each CAMSLINGER Streetomatic Thomas Leuthard Edition 10 EUR go into a Street Kids Project in Burundi. Please see Thomas Leuthards website here.
The Street Kids Project in Burundi is supervised by German non-profit organisation Burundikids .e.V. (www.burundikids.org). The collected money from this campaign will be used to buy school equipment for 80 children living in the ""Centre Birashoboka for Street Children"" in Burundis capital Bujumbura. For detailed information please visit the website of Burundikids.


What fits in a CAMSLINGER Streetomatic?It's very easy to look for the dimensions of your camera and then you'll see, if your gear will fit in. The CAMSLINGER Streetomatic has inner diemnsions of 175mm/7"" (l) x 155mm/6"" (h) and 85mm to 105mm/3.4"" to 4.2"" (d) due to a flexible back.

Quotes from users of the original CAMSLINGER 
HAJE JAN KAMPS, author of Focus on Travel Photography and 10 other photography books – “I’ve been using the original Camslinger since launch, and I haven’t looked back. My Sony A7 has found its perfect companion: Safe from the rain and hidden away from thieving eyes, but always at my fingertips. The additional freedom gained from not needing to have a strap on my camera is magical, too.”

STEVE HUFF – ""It’s so comfortable to wear as well as beeing 100% functional that it was a pleasure to wear and walk around with.”

THOMAS LEUTHARD – “The ultimate bag for the mirrorless hero.”
ALEX COGHE – ""I love the “always ready” concept of these bags, that makes you some sort of new urban gunslinger with a camera instead of a colt.""
MIRROR LESSONS – “The CAMSLINGERs are an easy and practical solution, and above all, a joy to use. I cannot imagine setting out on a photography outing or assignment without one anymore.”
THE PHOBLOGRAPHER – ""It’s a great solution for those with back problems, photographers on set or a wedding ...""
HERBERT PIEL – “There are really not much accessories that I would recommend with conviction, but now here comes the CAMSLINGER…”
GABOR RICHTER – “I’ve never been that fast to grab my cam. The CAMSLINGER is not only super comfy in daily use, but also super practical.”
KROLOP & GERST – “The CAMSLINGER is just insanely good!”
STREETHUNTERS.NET – “The Cosyspeed Camslinger Camera Bag is a fine product that I enjoy using very much. After a month it has become my number one choice for when I hit the streets…”





COSYSPEED GmbH is a German based brand and the first company in the world that is focused exclusively on accessories for mirrorless cameras. In 2014 COSYSPEED launched its first product the ""CAMSLINGER 160 Camera Bag for Mirrorless Cameras"". COSYSPEEDS philosophy is to develop innovative products for photographers and on the other side support actively development aid projects. The first product from this approach is the CAMPILLOW, made in a project in Burundi (and presumably the first photo product made in Africa).


While COSYSPEED GmbH is still a normal company, it is planned for 2016 to turn COSYSPEED into a non-profit company – the first one in the photo industry. To be able to do that we need your support in this campaign, because our financial situation needs to be more stable to do this turn. So come with us and create something NEW in an industry that cares for one of the most passionable things in the world – photography! 
Why doing a crowd-funding campaign for the CAMSLINGER Streetomatic?
The CAMSLINGER Streetomatic is the result of one and a half year of experiences with the original CAMSLINGER 160 bag. To launch the CAMSLINGER Streetomatic, we simply do not have the funds, nevertheless we invested already a good amount of the profits from the first product into the development of the CAMSLINGER Streetomatic. The Streetomatic is tested by many involved photographers and now ready for production. We just need your support to realize this amazing bag! 




In addition to the CAMSLINGER Streetomatic you can choose some useful accessories:

BELTEXTENSION to extend the belt of the CAMSLINGER Streetomatic up to 165 cm / 65""


 
CAMPILLOW for the safe storage of your camera on your desk. With this perk you will support a development aid project in Burundi. 

Furthermore you can use the accessory bags from the original CAMSLINGER 160 series to put for example an additional lens on the belt of your CAMSLINGER Streetomatic. Please visit the COSYSPEED website.



April 2014 – July 2015 | Collecting ideas
March 2015 – August 2015 | Prototyping
April 2015 – July 2015 | Testing
August 2015 | Finalizing production-ready prototypes
September 2015 | INDIEGOGO campaign
October 2015 | Payment of the funds from the CAMSLINGER Streetomatic Thomas Leuthard Edition to the Street Kids Project in Burundi

December 2015 – January 2016| Shipping in our warehouses US and Germany
January 2016 | Shipping to backers
February 2016 | Beginning shippment to distributors



The CAMSLINGER Streetomatic is an already ready-to-production product and will be manufactured as soon as the campaign is successfully completed. The production-ready-prototypes are already tested by well known photographers and do work without any problem. As COSYSPEED has already several products in production, we can access an already well working chain of high quality manufacturing, shipment and distribution. Our main manufacturer is located in the Chinese Shenzen area and run by a German manufacturing company. It is guaranteed that quality is on a very high standard and that all workers are working under very good and proven conditions.
With a successful campaign in the back there are in our opinion no real risks. Only serious circumstances are a risk, such as natural desasters or a deep economic crisis.  
The main challenge is to make this campaign a success. And with your help and recommandations it is realistic that we can master this amazing time in September 2015.





Thomas Ludwig, CEO and founder of COSYSPEED
Thomas Ludwig has had an advertising agency in Germany for almost 20 years and was working as development aid worker for the German Development Service in African countries. He is a photo nerd since many years and has a passion for street photography (but not much time for it). He lives with his family near Hamburg/Germany.
At first glance this seems to be a rather small team, but there are many more in the background who were involved into this project. So it's time to say THANKS!
-----------------------------------------------

The CAMSLINGER Streetomatic was developped with support of many photographers and especially street photographers, as a small and quick accessible bag seems to be ideal for street photography.
A very special thanks goes of course to Thomas Leuthard, whos ideas flowed in the CAMSLINGER Streetomatic and who is the patron to the CAMSLINGER Streetomatic Thomas Leuthard Edition. Our philosophies of passion for innovative gear and supporting projects in development countries found a perfect synergy in the CAMSLINGER Streetomatic. The CAMSLINGER Streetomatic is a bag developped out of Thomas daily practice and might be usable for many street photographers. 
Furthermore we'd like to thank Spyros Papaspyropoulos, Alex Coghe, Herbert Piel, Heather Broster & Mathieu Gasquet, Chris Gampat, Simon Ellingworth, Gabor Richter, the team from our German distributor Enjoyyourcamera and many others for their thoughts and ideas.
We'd like to thank Hanna and Sammi from the design and manufacturing team for their constant and constructive support. Stephanie, Leonharda and Annette from the design team of the original CAMSLINGER for the basic development of the CAMSLINGER concept. The Team from PROBIS Hamburg and Foto Gressung Saarbrücken for helping us out with product images. Jan Wagner for the great video he made for the CAMSLINGER Streetomatic (and many other COSYSPEED videos). Antonia, Friederike and Robin for standing in front of the camera. Haje Jan Kamps for being one of the most amiable guys we met in the last years for helping us with his experiences out of many crowd-funding campaigns.  Elliot Paul Stern for his outstsanding kindness, constructive ideas and thoughts. Michael, Bernhard and Horst for their support in general and last but not least my wonderful wife Friederike and sweet little daughter Elfriede for being so patient and supporting a nerd realizing his humble visions.
And many thanks to all you guys that are not mentioned here. All of you wonderful peops out there are part of this project and without you we won't be where we are.

It damps and minimizes your body movements so they don't get transferred to your action camera. The result is smooth and steady footage without dealing with postproduction software. It saves your time and money. The innovative patent-submitted construction allows a compact, lightweight and robust design. Your STABYLIZR is 100% waterproof, always ready and needs no battery. a professional mechanical stabilization system. It is ideal for capturing your special moments, everyday, sport and action activities. You do not need any technical knowledge to film with STABYLIZR. It is very easy.  TRIPOD FUNCTION: even when you are not in movement your STABYLIZR helps you to make better videos. Through its construction and robust design you can easily use it as a tripod on rough surfaces, trees, handrails, basically everywhere. BASIC GRIP (Included) The Basic Grip is included. It is made out durable soft foam and feels just great in your hand. The whole system is so lightweight that it can even float. For heavier setups please add a floaty backdoor.     POWER GRIPWe love smart gadgets and we hate running out of battery! So we added a power bar in our POWER GRIP which allows you to charge your GoPro or other devices up to two times. Get it in addition with one STABYLIZR for just 30€ (34$) instead of 49€ (55$). Get your POWER GRIP for only 30€ (34$)!  STABYLIZR works with GoPro Hero and Hero [2,3,3+,4,Session] and GoPro sized cameras. The max. camera size you can use with the Stabylizr is the GoPro Hero3 with the old big housing plus BacPac that equals the measurements of 78x69x48mm (3.07x2.68x1.89in). UPDATE: Xiaomi YI can unfortunately only be used in the frame not the housing.The STABYLIZR head is compatible with every GoPro mount. You can use STABYLIZR and your action camera with: 
Different housings 
Frames
Battery and LCD BacPac
The system can be easily adopted with the balancing nuts. SUPER EASY SET UP: 1) Plug in and align your camera  STEP 1: Plug in and align your camera 2) Adjust the balancing nut and start filming smooth footage    STEP 2: Adjust the balancing nut and start filming smooth footage  STABYLIZR

Founder: Wolfgang Fallmann and Miriam Boubachta OUR STORYWe love to capture our sport and outdoor activities. But we were not always happy with the result. Since solutions on the market did not fit our needs, we decided to build our own stabilization system. With an engineering degree in background and a lot of creativity we built the first prototype from the components of a toilet lid and roller skates. A year and many more prototypes later we created STABYLIZR: a compact and easy to use system for everyone.

Gründer: Wolfgang Fallmann und Miriam Boubachta Unsere Geschichte Wir lieben es, unsere Sport und Outdoor Aktivitäten zu filmen. Mit dem Resultat waren wir leider oft nicht zufrieden. Da die derzeitigen Lösungen auf dem Markt unsere Bedürfnisse nicht erfüllt haben, beschlossen wir unser eigenes System zu entwickeln. Mit einem Maschinenbauabschluss in der Tasche und viel Kreativität entstand der erste Prototyp, aus den Komponenten eines Klodeckels und Rollerskates. Ein Jahr und viele Prototypen später haben wir STABYLIZR kreiert: ein kompaktes, einfaches System für alle.  
STABYLIZR Prototyp Geschichte & Stefan unser stilles Teammitglied An dieser Stelle möchten wir uns gerne bei unseren Freunden, Familie und Unterstützern bedanken, die uns während des gesamten Prozesses immer Beiseite gestanden sind. Speziell in Bezug auf die Kampagne möchten wir folgenden Personen danken:

   Mit deiner Unterstützung können wir STABYLIZR zum Leben erwecken. Wir haben vollfunktionsfähige 3D gedruckte Prototypen, die großartige Videos erzeugen. Mit unseren Fertigungs- und Assemblierungspartnern aus Österreich haben wir alle notwendigen Schritte für die Produktion festgelegt und können mit der Massenproduktion sofort starten. Durch deine Unterstützung werden die Werkzeugformen, die erste Produktionsserie und die Verpackung finanziert. Nach dem Erreichen des Zieles starten wir sofort mit der Produktion. Wir freuen uns, ein super Produkt zu einem guten Preis liefern zu können. Bitte unterstütz uns indem du die Kampagne in deinem Netzwerk teilst. Ein paar Klicks für dich, machen für uns einen Riesenunterschied.    UPDATE: PRODUKTION BEGONNEN Nach über einem Jahr an der Entwicklung von STABYLIZR haben wir nun vollfunktionsfähige 3D gedruckte Prototypen. Unsere Zuliefer- und Fertigungspartner sind bereit, die Komponenten in der notwendigen Qualität und Quantität zu produzieren. Um die Qualität sicherzustellen, Kommunikationswege zu verkürzen und die lokale Wirtschaft zu unterstützen, haben wir uns für Produktionspartner in Österreich entschieden. Diese stehen in den Startlöchern! Sobald wir das Ziel erreicht haben, starten wir mit der Spritzgussfertigung. Risiken und Herausforderungen Uns ist bewusst, dass immer etwas Unvorhersehbares eintreten kann und uns Hindernisse auf dem Weg zur Auslieferung begegnen werden. Wir bauen deswegen auf ein Netwerk aus Experten und anderen Startups, die bereits Produkte produziert haben. Dieses erweitern wir ständig, um sicherzustellen, dass wir STABYLIZR in der richtigen Qualität und nach Zeitplan zu dir liefern können. Die größte Herausforderung stellt die Produktion dar, daher vertrauen wir hier auf einen erfahrenen Partner, mit dem wir bereits während der Entwicklung der Prototypen zusammengearbeitet haben. Alle produktionstechnisch notwendigen Anpassungen wurden bereits durchgeführt. Wir haben uns bewusst für österreichische Produktions- und Assemblierungspartner entschieden auf die wir uns voll verlassen können, um so zu garantieren, dass wir wie geplant ausliefern.",51.0,4,"1 Campaign

We’ve all experienced it, the $100 pair of goggles ruined because of one careless drop, forgetting your protective bag on your big trip, hitting the glades and that tree branch, or by just wiping your lens (and scratching it) in the wintry mix on the summit. Oh, we all know it. But here’s the thing, Ripclear knows how to stop it for good!</p><p>Over the last year we've been perfecting a product that can be applied to any goggle lens simply and with outstanding results. We built Ripclear’s product because we wanted to solve a recurring problem in the lives of our friends, family, and now hopefully the world.  The great thing is, with your contribution, now we can solve this problem that many of us have faced before.  </p><p>Since we started Ripclear, we’ve tested a variety of shapes, material compositions, low tack adhesives, and static cling films.

The Story: Ripclear - The Fight Against Scratches





Protect Your Lens From Lens Rash
      With Ripclear's Universal Lens Protector

Yeah, scratches….Ripclear’s story started because of one issue, lens scratches. We’ve all experienced it, the $100 pair of goggles ruined because of one careless drop, forgetting your protective bag on your big trip, hitting the glades and that tree branch, or by just wiping your lens (and scratching it) in the wintry mix on the summit. Oh, we all know it. But here’s the thing, Ripclear knows how to stop it for good!Over the last year we've been perfecting a product that can be applied to any goggle lens simply and with outstanding results. We built Ripclear’s product because we wanted to solve a recurring problem in the lives of our friends, family, and now hopefully the world.  The great thing is, with your contribution, now we can solve this problem that many of us have faced before.  Since we started Ripclear, we’ve tested a variety of shapes, material compositions, low tack adhesives, and static cling films. We’ve researched dozens of suppliers for our product and we’ve seen the results on dozens of goggles through rigorous alpha testing to acomplish 1 goal: Prove we can stop lens rash and save you from buying another $80 replacement lens. Pretty neat, I know!Scott, Ryan, and Zach in Detroit Designing Ripclear's GraphicsThe great thing is, we have an idea and we can follow through on it! The Ripclear team’s background is perfectly suited for the product and customer experience we’ve built for you. Ripclear.com has dedicated and passionate skiers and snowboards with real world experience bringing successful products to market.What’s most important to us is that we’re a tight group of friends and business partners wanting to solve a problem we literally had in front of us.  We’re also pumped we had an excuse to ski and snowboard at a mountian that gets an average annual snowfall of 462 inches (1,173 cm); our home mountain, Mount Bachelor!

</h3><p>I have used this camera to put together tons of free shoots to help friends and models out. It's been used so much the the camera is wearing out and won't focus correctly, nor will my USB port for tethering work (Tethering allows me to show you in real time your photos on my computer screen). Also I do film work and other such things to help others out. Now I'm stuck with a camera that has had a lot of use. It's just worn out, and I need to buy a new one as the repairs would cost more than the camera. What would getting this new camera improve:</p><ul>
<li>Photo Quality, going from an 18 Mega Pixel camera to a 22 Mega Pixel camera would make photos look much sharper and cleaner. Plus it would boost the print quality through the roof. <br/>
</li>
<li>I would be able to finally shoot events for my friends and family. My camera has a maximum ISO of 6400 and is super noisy in the dark. If I were able to get my new camera I would have an ISO of 25k which would allow me to shoot almost completely in the dark. Also for film work, I'd be able to shoot my horror films with much better picture quality in dark scenes.<br/>
</li>
<li>Faster and more precise focus. I would be able to do photo shoots from start to finish without having focus problem. My T3i had lots of issues in low light finding focus, and if it did it would focus on noses, or lips instead of eyes on auto. </li>
<li>Built in Wireless will allow me to have the photo I just took of you be able to appear on the computer so you can see your photos and results in real time.<br/>
</li>
</ul><p>I have never charged much for photos, and I've done tons of free work and helped people on so many levels to get great photos for whatever they needed them for. I'm not the type of person who generally asks for help, but I need it here. With the state of my camera right now, it's near impossible to do what I do. If you've liked my work, and want to help me out, I will continue to put out great work for you to enjoy and would finally be able to shoot all these great events my friends put out there. <br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Well here's sort of a run down on what I need.:</p><ul>
<li>The camera I am looking at, is the Canon EOS 6D. It's one of Canon's cheapest full frame cameras on the market. It has 11 auto-focus points built in, which would allow me much more diversity for photos than I had previously been allowed. It's currently at 1899.00 on Amazon. We would get free shipping as we have a Prime account.<br/>
</li>
<li>Well what I can offer you is specialized photo shoots. I have a full studio with the best studio lighting I could afford. To give you the best look. I will have multiple options for people who choose to help me out here.<br/>
</li>
<li>The funds earned in this campaign will 100% go into the purchase of a new camera. <br/>
</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>You'd not only help improve the quality of my pictures, but you'd help many others receive wonderful photos as well. I do a lot of free work to help people out that need it and I do a lot of work with people around the community to help with their projects as well. This camera would be able to help me do so much more and no limit me to a studio setting. Things this would impact right away.<br/></p><ul>
<li>Modeling and Head shots. I do a lot of these for people, a lot of the time pro-bono. Plus a lot of videos as well. I've got a project coming up dealing with mental issues and how they're perceived.<br/>
</li>
<li>I've done over 200 photo shoots and have shot over 40,000 photos alone. So believe me, the work I plan to do after this camera will only go to serve this community better and give people the confidence in themselves that I know I can help create with a beautiful photo.<br/>
</li>
<li>Photography and Film is my passion and love. Without a camera that is working correctly its near impossible to do my work. Please help me with this. Had it not been for Stacy and I's wedding,we wouldn't be in such dire straights with our savings, but we're behind on bills, and struggling to get caught up. So a new camera isn't in the budget.</li>

<p>GoFish Cam is a patent pending wireless, underwater action-adventure camera that sits on your fishing line and captures the real action of the sport in conjunction with our mobile application. </p>

<p>Meant for trolling, cast-and-retrieve, and bottom fishing in both salt and freshwater environments, the GoFish Cam has been designed with a stabilized, waterproof design to allow anglers to record the action down to 150 meters (~500 Feet) underwater without the wobble. In 2014, two brothers came up with an idea for an underwater fishing camera while on a fishing trip. After securing funds from friends and family, and investing more than a year of time, GoFish Cam was born.</p>

<p><b><i>When can I purchase a GoFish Cam? </i></b></p>
<p>GoFish Cam will be shipping its first units in September of 2016!</p>
<p>Pre-order now here at IndieGogo to save on price!</p>
<p>In addition, it can be purchased on our website: <a href=""http://www.GoFishCam.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.GoFishCam.com</a>. To be kept up to date about when GoFish Cam will be released, sign up to our newsletter on our website. </p>
<p><i><b>What is the cost of a GoFish Cam? </b></i></p>
<p>GoFish Cam's suggested retail price is $169.99 U.S. Be sure to check out our website early for savings. 
</p>
<p><b><i>Does the camera record sound?</i> </b></p>
<p>Yes! The GoFish Cam has a built in microphone to make sure that the entire experience is captured underwater. </p>
<p><b><i>Can I record in the dark?</i> </b></p>
<p>Yes! GoFish Cam has been designed with a green light emitting diode (LED) ring around the camera lens. The lighting gives an extra 1M of visibility. </p>
<p><b><i>How does GoFish Cam remain waterproof?</i> </b></p>
<p>We’ve designed the GoFish Cam to be extra durable and water resistant. It has been tested to work to 150 meters (~500feet!). </p>
<p><b><i>What do I do if my line snaps and the camera falls off?</i> </b></p>
<p>The GoFish Cam has been designed to sit on the fishing line. It sits between your casting line and lure (or leader line). We suggest using a leader line. We recommend using a heavy braided casting line and attaching the camera in between the leader and casting line, so if it snaps, the chance is it'll snap on the leader leaving your camera still attached to the casting line. Also, in the near future, GoFish Cam may be offering a warranty program for GoFish Cam clients. Purchase the warranty policy, and in the case that you lose your camera, get a new camera at a heavy discount. Further details on this will be provided at a later date.</p>
<p><i><b>How do I get started? </b></i></p>
<p>

Upon receiving your GoFish Cam, make sure to read the manual and register your camera on the mobile application. Instructions are easy: Download the app, enter your product key code and record! </p>
<p><i><b>Where can I share my videos? </b></i></p>
<p>

GoFish Cam’s mobile application will allow users to share videos through most major social media channels – Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Youtube. If you notice we’re missing one, let us know and we’ll do our best to accommodate! </p>
<p><b><i>Can I see my videos on my mobile device?</i> </b></p>
<p>Absolutely! GoFish Cam has developed a mobile application to work with your Smartphone. It works alongside the camera wirelessly. We encourage users to review, edit, and share footage. Currently, the video cannot be streamed in real-time underwater. That's a feature we're working on.</p>
<p><b><i>How to Use the GoFish Cam?</i></b></p>
<p>The camera can be used for three different fishing styles; Trolling, Casting, Bottom Fishing.</p>
<p><b>Trolling &amp; Casting:</b></p>
<div data-id=""4138735"">
<figure style=""margin: 0px;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1463411048/fhufbxjyaebcirpdlkfx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Trolling is the most popular style the GoFish Cam is used for. In this style of fishing there exists the most tension, as there is always a drag. The drag keeps the camera extremely steady and will allow exceptional quality footage.</p>
<p>Casting is another popular style the GoFish Cam is used for. In this style of fishing there may be some shaky footage, but we are working on some new features for production to fix that. Currently, heavier lures for casting works better than lighter ones.</p>
<p><b>Bottom Fishing:</b></p>
<div data-id=""4138737"">
<figure style=""margin: 0px;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1463411048/hq7jzdhd1qazmhoplkiz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The GoFish Cam can also be used for bottom fishing. In this style of fishing, make sure the weight is attached before the camera as per above. This will help the camera face the bait to capture the right footage. </p>
<p><b><i>How Do I Attach The GoFish Cam To My Line?</i></b></p>
<p>The GoFish Cam is very easy to attach to a fishing line. There are two ends to the camera. The back end will be attached to the casting line and the front end to your leader line. You can either tie the lines straight to the camera or tie your line to a snap and use that to connect to the camera.</p>
<p><b><i>How Do You Stop The Camera From Spinning?</i></b></p>
<p>The camera is built with a stabilization fin. The fin works best when there is tension or drag from both ends of the camera. As long as you're trolling, reeling in, or battling a fish you'll find less spinning. The more action, the more stable! We're also working on new features for the production run to ensure that we minimize any spinning (hopefully fully).</p>
<p><b><i>How Far Does The WiFi Go?</i></b></p>
<p>The WiFi has been tested to 40Ft out of water.</p>
<p>Current technology for WiFi does not allow it to go speak to a mobile devicde under water as the water disrupts the signal. We are working closely with researchers and different institutions to make sure that when WiFi has under water capabilities, the GoFish Cam does too!</p>
<p><b><i>How Does The WiFi Work?</i></b></p>
<p>The GoFish Cam emits its own WiFi signal. The camera works similar to how your house's WiFi; when you leave the range of your house your phone disconnects, and once your phone comes back into range, it reconnects. When the camera comes back into range of your phone, it picks up on the WiFi signal and reconnects. This allows you to review all the footage on your GoFish Cam via our app on your mobile device.   </p>

</div></div>","GoFish Cam is a patent pending wireless, underwater action-adventure camera that sits on your fishing line and captures the real action of the sport in conjunction with our mobile application. 







Meant for trolling, cast-and-retrieve, and bottom fishing in both salt and freshwater environments, the GoFish Cam has been designed with a stabilized, waterproof design to allow anglers to record the action down to 150 meters (~500 Feet) underwater without the wobble. In 2014, two brothers came up with an idea for an underwater fishing camera while on a fishing trip. After securing funds from friends and family, and investing more than a year of time, GoFish Cam was born.


















*******Note: We've brought the production units over 30% smaller and lighter than prototype depicted in images*******












Equipped with HD 1080p color video and night vision, the GoFish Cam catches the complete underwater experience through a 170° wide-angle lens and built-in microphone even in the deepest, darkest of conditions. It’s fishing like you’ve never seen before – trust us!








 
It’s easy to share the exciting action and your catch with friends, family and the GoFish Cam community. The mobile application creates limitless possibilities for its users! It provides a simple user interface to review, edit, and share action-captured videos through your own social networks, directly from the GoFish Cam App. 






The app also lets users leverage and learn from each other's experiences. It provides users with data like what bait or lures to use in specific locations, what works for specific types of fish, where to find them, and when to go fishing!









In 2014, two brothers came up with an idea for an underwater fishing camera while on a fishing trip. The two brothers found Kieran Howlett an avid angler, but also a tech genius! Together, the three partnered with BeKnown, and have invested more than a year of time working hard to bring to market the best underwater fishing camera. 












Use of Funds:
We want to be transparent on how we spend the funds from our supporters. Here is a projection of how the funds will be invested.




Note: this use of funds schedule includes IndieGoGo pledge money and other outside investment money from our seed financing round.











GoFish Cam is a great technology and product and we believe it can impact the fishing world in a BIG way! We’re a new start up so that’s why we need your help. We truly appreciate the love!

In 1959, Nikon revealed Nikon F and brought the SLR technology up to a professional level. When Japan’s economy took off towards globalization in the 60s, two large scale events took place in Japan. One was the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and the other was the Expo of 1970 in Osaka. Both events provided Japan with important opportunities to showcase their technology and management skills to the world. </p><p>Nikon mastered the world’s most exceptional photography system at the time, such as releasing photos immediately during those two important events. At that time, Mikami Co. LTD Tokyo Japan, a Japanese optics company, invented an attachment for Nikon F to produce polaroid pictures - Speed Magny 100. It could magnify the 135 image to almost 4x5 large Polaroid peel-apart instant film. With the instant Polaroid, images were able to be published to the world immediately. However, the Speed Magny was not suitable for general use due to the large size and heavy weight. Now, the Polaroid peel-apart film has stopped production.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531399812/cnk1l7xpuodeounc7nsw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531399850/pfggyayogwezmwozdz5c.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The Instant Magny 35 utilizes lightweight and sturdy engineering plastic and aluminum alloy. The use of these materials brings the total weight to 485 grams, similar to the weight of an iPad, which is only a quarter of the weight of the Nikon Speed Magny (approximately 2 kg). As the weight is roughly the same as general zoom lenses, you can shoot easily without burden.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531380308/b4ypmyxljk6s0x696bam.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531380321/rwnkzjoxkemjejjdpanq.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The Instant Magny 35’s optic scheme enlarges the 24x24mm focal plane image to 62x62mm. Travel distance of the optic dimension needs to be over 10cm, so the Instax Square Back cannot be assembled in the back of the camera. As a result, the design of the Instant Magny 35 includes a high reflective rate mirror to lead the optic axis to the lower portion of the camera. In addition, it greatly shortens the rear extended optical structure. Regardless of whether the SLR or Rangefinder camera is used, it can be easily connected to the Instant Magny 35 and is ready to shoot at any scene.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531400004/zuc2xi973cqx5ieqvs6o.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The design of a high reflective rate mirror reduces the light loss of an image during the enlarging process. In the past, the Nikon Speed Magny adopted a design of double mirrors, which could convert the image back to normal, but was responsible for the large size of the camera. It also led to another serious issue: the light loss rate hitting 5 stops during the enlarging process. The Instant Magny’s light loss rate is controlled within 3 stops and its exposure value simultaneously turns the ISO800 on Instax Square film to ISO100. As the aperture lens system on the 135 camera is relatively large, the Instant Magny is a convenient and reliable accessory for taking instant photographs.</p><p><strong>UPDATE @ Oct 9 2018 - <br/>Photos taken with latest Nikon Version Functional Prototype</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539061792/u2ogbznrlwqe8ee50osp.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539061743/wdufgq6bi2vbxubvjvil.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>UPDATE @ Aug 9 2018 - <br/>Photos taken with Leica Version Functional Prototype!</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533798577/s0vg4wdxm44f1rqszrrb.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533798860/jt4ya39sqkiedakq2m04.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533799115/sle42vs7yr04aktsvbjg.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><i>Camera: Leica M3 | Lens : Summicron 90mm f2 Version 1 @ f/4</i></p><p><strong>UPDATE @ Jul 6 2018 - <br/>Photos taken with Nikon Version Functional Prototype!</strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533798243/lvt5r0btug5e5y8stx76.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533798279/gz0otyt8zgpdvrhuzg99.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><i>Camera : Nikon FM-2 + Lens : Nikkor 50mm f1.2 @f4</i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531380353/cduxgzum0mtxugxbj9an.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531380378/n1dcdsfivwkwfok60w0j.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531380433/z5lkqfwc84em6rlkdp7j.png"" src=""""/></p><ul>

An unprecedented instant photography experience using your most reliable and familiar camera and lens 
Innovative design allows you to carry or store it easily and freely 
Discovering the real you 
Utilizing the commonly used Fujifilm Instax Square instant film
From the beginning of the twentieth century until today, 135 Single Lens Reflex (SLR) and Rangefinder cameras are dependable, lightweight, and leading technology in capturing countless classic images.Now, you can use Fujifilm Instax Square through the Instant Magny 35 in the decisive moment. The new camera accessory, the Instant Magny 35, enables you to use a 135 SLR and Rangefinder camera to capture instant photographs. It is specifically designed to capture images using film cameras without any modifications, bringing passionate photographers an unprecedented instant photography experience!An instant photo turns a moment into a solid photo eternally, which charms photographers of all generations. The Instant Magny 35, developed by NINM Lab, is ideal for SLR and Rangefinder cameras of Leica, Nikon, Canon and Olympus. Let all passionate film photographers experience the feeling and control of images developing.
Detach the original camera back
Install the Instant Magny 35's enlarging optics film back onto the camera
Then, attach 3 parts properly.
Pull the dark-slide on the Instant Magny 35
Proceed to take the picture as usual. Press the film ejection button and take the film out to develop

 
 For convenience, the Instant Magny 35 uses a strong mechanical modular design. It is comprised of enlarging optics film back, aluminum lens barrel, and film ejection unit. These three components are connected by a bayonet mount, making it simple to assemble and disassemble in order to transport or store. With an integrated dark-slide and control of the on-off switch, accidental shots are prevented and error of taking out film without shooting is eliminatedUnlimited multiple exposure to inspire unlimited creative ideasA film counter LED tells the user the number of film(s) leftSeeing your image in a photograph is seeing from the others’ perspective. People tend to be more familiar with their image in the mirror, but seeing themselves in pictures is not. However, when you use the Instant Magny 35 to capture portraits, the subject will feel more intimate with the image because this is the true “you” that you see in the mirror every day. Due to the focal plane of the Instant Magny 35 through a monolithic mirror, a mirror image is projected onto the Instax Square Instant film, which is the ideal result from the consideration of optical engineering and the process of product development. As a result, a familiar image of the subject can be captured as the photographer is taking portraits.The 135 instant backs previously developed were not designed for general use, an example being the Speed Magny system introduced by Nikon in the 60s. In 1959, Nikon revealed Nikon F and brought the SLR technology up to a professional level. When Japan’s economy took off towards globalization in the 60s, two large scale events took place in Japan. One was the 1964 Tokyo Olympics and the other was the Expo of 1970 in Osaka. Both events provided Japan with important opportunities to showcase their technology and management skills to the world. Nikon mastered the world’s most exceptional photography system at the time, such as releasing photos immediately during those two important events. At that time, Mikami Co. LTD Tokyo Japan, a Japanese optics company, invented an attachment for Nikon F to produce polaroid pictures - Speed Magny 100. It could magnify the 135 image to almost 4x5 large Polaroid peel-apart instant film. With the instant Polaroid, images were able to be published to the world immediately. However, the Speed Magny was not suitable for general use due to the large size and heavy weight. Now, the Polaroid peel-apart film has stopped production.The Instant Magny 35 utilizes lightweight and sturdy engineering plastic and aluminum alloy. The use of these materials brings the total weight to 485 grams, similar to the weight of an iPad, which is only a quarter of the weight of the Nikon Speed Magny (approximately 2 kg). As the weight is roughly the same as general zoom lenses, you can shoot easily without burden. The Instant Magny 35’s optic scheme enlarges the 24x24mm focal plane image to 62x62mm. Travel distance of the optic dimension needs to be over 10cm, so the Instax Square Back cannot be assembled in the back of the camera. As a result, the design of the Instant Magny 35 includes a high reflective rate mirror to lead the optic axis to the lower portion of the camera. In addition, it greatly shortens the rear extended optical structure. Regardless of whether the SLR or Rangefinder camera is used, it can be easily connected to the Instant Magny 35 and is ready to shoot at any scene.The design of a high reflective rate mirror reduces the light loss of an image during the enlarging process. In the past, the Nikon Speed Magny adopted a design of double mirrors, which could convert the image back to normal, but was responsible for the large size of the camera. It also led to another serious issue: the light loss rate hitting 5 stops during the enlarging process. The Instant Magny’s light loss rate is controlled within 3 stops and its exposure value simultaneously turns the ISO800 on Instax Square film to ISO100. As the aperture lens system on the 135 camera is relatively large, the Instant Magny is a convenient and reliable accessory for taking instant photographs.UPDATE @ Oct 9 2018 - Photos taken with latest Nikon Version Functional PrototypeUPDATE @ Aug 9 2018 - Photos taken with Leica Version Functional Prototype!Camera: Leica M3 | Lens : Summicron 90mm f2 Version 1 @ f/4UPDATE @ Jul 6 2018 - Photos taken with Nikon Version Functional Prototype!Camera : Nikon FM-2 + Lens : Nikkor 50mm f1.2 @f4

<p>We are a team of passionate Berkeley &amp; Stanford engineers who believe in bringing Virtual Reality to everyone. Therefore, we created the world's first 3D AND 180° stereoscopic consumer camera. This small, portable device empowers anyone to easily capture experiences with true depth and peripheral sight in order to create an immersive reality to share with everyone.  </p>

<p>Contributing to this campaign helps our team put one of these devices into the hands of all consumers, so we can all create and share unending VR content. </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $100,000 to fund our manufacturing ramp-up and production of <a href=""http://lucidcam.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>LucidCam</b></a> in mass quantities. We have worked tirelessly for the last two years to rethink the current video market and break down multiple camera module solutions into only a 2-lens compact system.</p>

What is the difference between LucidCam and the Oculus Rift?Oculus Rift is a VR headset which serves as a display device. LucidCam is a VR camera which serves as capture device. We want to help you CREATE the content that other devices help you view.

Why 180 degrees instead of 360 degrees?Capturing in 180 degrees has many benefits in regards to portability, storytelling, shooting, and scalability. Reducing a VR camera to 180 degrees makes it small and easy to fit into your pocket. With 180 degrees you still give the immersion, but limit the user to the right content and field of view. 180 degrees allows you to do normal point-and-shoot without capturing yourself or other things you don’t want to capture. Additionally, 180 degrees is scalable into 360, but 360 is difficult to reduce down in form factor.
What sensors does LucidCam use?Sony sensors similar to GoPro.
How big is the on-board storage?On-board storage will be 16GB and you can extend it with any micro SD to higher capacities.
General Industry Questions
What is Virtual Reality?Virtual Reality is an immersive video experience. Now you can watch 3D movies with a wide field of view.

Quite simply the world's most advanced step ring adapter ever made for a camera lens. Our cleverly designed and innovative variable blade technology gives any DSLR or Mirrorless camera system user the ability to use 1 single filter on multiple lenses, without the need for multiple step rings. So simple in its function, many have said: ""why has this never been done before?"". Well, now we are proud to say that it has been done! But, we are not quite there yet.

Our manufacturing process ensures that the materials used match the quality that customers have come to expect from H&amp;Y. We are confident that image-makers across the globe will fall in love with this new concept and the <strong><span>REVORING</span></strong> systems will quickly become an indispensable partner for countless photographers and filmmakers.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/H21NEcV6t3ECAhOEt4/source.gif"" src=""""/></p><div data-id=""29586817""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p></figure></div><div data-id=""29820965""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596729310/aekt5uc3dnt2oh4rcgfg.jpg"" src=""""/></p></figure></div><div data-id=""29667456""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p></figure></div><div data-id=""29587088""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1596463008/kgq38zd8ooidfxovrcfo.jpg"" src=""""/></p></figure></div><div data-id=""29635541""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1596463009/uy78tquwtvoxajdgfzde.jpg"" src=""""/></p></figure></div><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">TIGHT GRIP</h1><p style=""text-align: center;"">The major feature of the H&amp;Y <strong><span>REVORING</span></strong> and <strong><span>REVORING</span></strong> Variable Neutral Density + CPL filter system is the ability to switch between lenses with a single filter; a simple twist, and away you go! However, when designing the variable retracting blades, we knew we had to match the strength of a regular filter attached to a lens. Coupled with the force of the retracting blades and independent threading, one final turn ensures that the <strong><span>REVORING</span></strong> is securely mounted onto your lens.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/j2SnlWBuXOzkihYwS5/source.gif"" src=""""/></p><h1 style=""text-align: center;""> <span>GLASS</span> &amp; <span>COATING</span> </h1><p style=""text-align: center;"">Anti-Fingerprint &amp; Waterproof Nano-Coating Technology has been applied to the <strong><span>REVORING</span></strong> Variable Neutral Density + CPL filter system to protect the glass from the unpredictable factors that all photographers and filmmakers face when shooting outdoors. The coating helps with beading and any excess droplets can be easily removed with a lens cloth without the fear of eliminating any of the coatings and without leaving stubborn smears on the glass.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">The German Schott B270® glass also includes Anti-Reflective coatings, which virtually eliminate all flare and reflections from the front and rear surfaces. This helps visible light to pass through the glass by removing unwanted reflections, giving the user the best possible light transmission (up to 97%), optimizing images for the sharpest possible outcome. Whether shooting at 16mm or 400mm, the glass and coatings used in the <strong><span>REVORING</span></strong> Variable Neutral Density + CPL filter system produce sharp images, even at light reductions of up 10 stops.  </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Each side of the <strong><span>REVORING's</span></strong> glass has 9 layers of the above coatings applied.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/XHB5HlII0m079MfRQc/source.gif"" src=""""/></p><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">ADDITIONAL FEATURES</h1><p style=""text-align: center;"">As a result of continued tests and working on feedback from our ambassadors, we are excited that we can already announce the following features which will be included in the final product - check out the video below showing these new features</p><div>

Let's face it, we are always on a quest for new bags and backpacks, with hundreds of pockets and compartments to carry all the latest gadgets and accessories launched every year. But, what if all you need to do is simply reduce the amount of gear you carry while achieving the same or greater level of productivity? The REVORING saves you the need to carry multiple filters and step rings, meaning you can pack lighter and more efficiently for your travels.  </p><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">SAVING TIME</h1><p> </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgabGZzcuUg?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div data-id=""29619080""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><div data-context=""Story Description"" data-dimensions='{""width"":680,""height"":382}' data-image=""https://d15chbti7ht62o.cloudfront.net/assets/029/619/080/8b7157a7b7dc1cb021abfc57254060da_h264_base.jpg?2020"" data-video-url=""https://v.kickstarter.com/1596635789_d2b75bf2300c7f6cd6a0a3f1cf175d2c8cb6179b/assets/029/619/080/8b7157a7b7dc1cb021abfc57254060da_h264_high.mp4""><div><div style=""text-align: center;""> </div></div></div></figure></div><p style=""text-align: center;"">The <strong><span>REVORING</span></strong> and <span><strong>REVORING</strong> Variable ND+CPL </span>will save you time when changing over filters for that perfect shot. For example, you might start off by shooting with a 24-70mm lens, and decide to switch to a 70-200mm, both of which may have a different thread size. You would either have to switch filters or adapt your filter using step rings, and we've all experienced this frustration, especially if you need multiple rings, or worse yet, they get stuck! With the <strong><span>REVORING</span></strong>, you just twist and remove from one lens, twist and mount to the other, it's that simple! </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Our US Ambassador, David Akoubian, got to play with a handful of our <strong>REVORING</strong> samples and had fun in showing just how easy it is to switch between lenses, saving him time when out shooting.      </p><h1 style=""text-align: center;""> <span>SAVING MONEY</span> </h1><p style=""text-align: center;"">Not only will the <strong><span>REVORING</span></strong> save you space and time, it will also save you money!

Quite simply the world's most advanced step ring adapter ever made for a camera lens. Our cleverly designed and innovative variable blade technology gives any DSLR or Mirrorless camera system user the ability to use 1 single filter on multiple lenses, without the need for multiple step rings. So simple in its function, many have said: ""why has this never been done before?"". Well, now we are proud to say that it has been done! But, we are not quite there yet. We now need your help in backing to bring this amazing product to life.   
  Almost 3 years of research and development, along with extensive field testing have been applied to bring the REVORING that much closer to reality. Our manufacturing process ensures that the materials used match the quality that customers have come to expect from H&Y. We are confident that image-makers across the globe will fall in love with this new concept and the REVORING systems will quickly become an indispensable partner for countless photographers and filmmakers.   TIGHT GRIPThe major feature of the H&Y REVORING and REVORING Variable Neutral Density + CPL filter system is the ability to switch between lenses with a single filter; a simple twist, and away you go! However, when designing the variable retracting blades, we knew we had to match the strength of a regular filter attached to a lens. Coupled with the force of the retracting blades and independent threading, one final turn ensures that the REVORING is securely mounted onto your lens. GLASS & COATING Anti-Fingerprint & Waterproof Nano-Coating Technology has been applied to the REVORING Variable Neutral Density + CPL filter system to protect the glass from the unpredictable factors that all photographers and filmmakers face when shooting outdoors. The coating helps with beading and any excess droplets can be easily removed with a lens cloth without the fear of eliminating any of the coatings and without leaving stubborn smears on the glass.The German Schott B270® glass also includes Anti-Reflective coatings, which virtually eliminate all flare and reflections from the front and rear surfaces. This helps visible light to pass through the glass by removing unwanted reflections, giving the user the best possible light transmission (up to 97%), optimizing images for the sharpest possible outcome. Whether shooting at 16mm or 400mm, the glass and coatings used in the REVORING Variable Neutral Density + CPL filter system produce sharp images, even at light reductions of up 10 stops.  Each side of the REVORING's glass has 9 layers of the above coatings applied.  ADDITIONAL FEATURESAs a result of continued tests and working on feedback from our ambassadors, we are excited that we can already announce the following features which will be included in the final product - check out the video below showing these new features
 

  Hard Stop - The Variable Neutral Density ring will feature a hard stop at “MAX” preventing the user from going beyond the 10 stop position on the ring. Guide Pin - In addition to the Circular Polarizer inner ring, the Variable Neutral Density outer ring will also feature a guide pin, for improved control and functionality Focal Length Guide - There will be a redesign of the Variable Neutral Density markers between “Min” and “Max"" to better reflect focal lengths and stops achieved using different lensesSAVING SPACE 
 


 

Space is a commodity for photographers and filmmakers! Let's face it, we are always on a quest for new bags and backpacks, with hundreds of pockets and compartments to carry all the latest gadgets and accessories launched every year. But, what if all you need to do is simply reduce the amount of gear you carry while achieving the same or greater level of productivity? The REVORING saves you the need to carry multiple filters and step rings, meaning you can pack lighter and more efficiently for your travels.  SAVING TIME  The REVORING and REVORING Variable ND+CPL will save you time when changing over filters for that perfect shot. For example, you might start off by shooting with a 24-70mm lens, and decide to switch to a 70-200mm, both of which may have a different thread size. You would either have to switch filters or adapt your filter using step rings, and we've all experienced this frustration, especially if you need multiple rings, or worse yet, they get stuck! With the REVORING, you just twist and remove from one lens, twist and mount to the other, it's that simple! Our US Ambassador, David Akoubian, got to play with a handful of our REVORING samples and had fun in showing just how easy it is to switch between lenses, saving him time when out shooting.       SAVING MONEY Not only will the REVORING save you space and time, it will also save you money! You no longer need to buy multiple filters or step-up rings for all of your lenses. Instead, choose a REVORING suitable for your lenses, add 1 filter, and you are good to go!   Philip Bloom has had hands-on with the REVORING. Watch his video, where he covers the many features it has, including just how much money it can save you! 
 
 DESIGNED FOR PHOTOGRAPHY & VIDEOThe REVORING Variable ND + CPL combination has the benefit of being an essential tool for shooting both videos and stills. Once you have attached the REVORING to your lens, you have a wealth of dynamic range at your fingertips, with the added bonus of a Circular Polarizer which features Japanese Nitto polarizing film - offering up to 99.9% polarizing efficiency. The REVORING Variable Neutral Density has a dynamic range of ND3 to ND1000, in photographic terms, this equates to 1.5 - 10 stops of light control!    The following chart is a useful guide to help understand what each ND Rating will help you achieve.

Testing, testing and more testing! We are our own worse critics at H&Y, always looking for ways to improve our products, especially the REVORING. Our ambassadors have also played an integral part in this journey. In fact, with their expertise and field testing, we have been able to make immediate, yet subtle design changes which have a big impact on the product's performance. One of those changes will be gapless edges, which can be seen belowBut, it doesn't stop there. We are committed to reviewing all of your suggestions, and where possible, we will try our hardest to implement any of your ideas to help improve the REVORING.  
 
   
   The following shipping prices and visible locations show an estimate as to what will be charged in our survey after the campaign has ended. Our intention is to ship worldwide!COVID-19 Shipping - During our continued research, we have come to learn a great deal about the temporary rise in shipping costs, and reduced services offered by 3PL and shipping partners as a result of COVID-19. The below prices reflect what it costs to ship a REVORING pledge today with an experienced crowdfunding 3PL partner we have in place. We will continue our research with a goal to improve the overall shipping cost, if at all possible.VAT, GST, Taxes & Duty - In order for us to make the REVORING as competitive as possible, we have worked hard bringing the price down to what we feel is an attractive level, especially for the campaign. This does mean that while we would love to include the cost of Shipping, VAT, GST and Duty, we simply do not have the room to do this. At the moment, we are consuming a portion of the higher shipping costs, and so any further taxes and duty costs importing the REVORING will be at the cost of the backer. We will continue our research into other options, and if we find a solution, we will keep everyone updated.   H&Y was founded in Hong Kong back in 2006, with the sole purpose of developing and providing high quality filter products. This quickly turned into H&Y becoming one of the leading choice of brands in ASIA.Fast forward to the present, and you will see that H&Y continues to manufacture new and exciting filter systems at a competitive price point, through concept design and the continuous process of innovation being an integral part of the company focus. This has led to a unique approach to the development of the company’s product range, with the requirements of the user being a key driving force in the company’s ambition to deliver functional and beautiful, filters and accessories. The very first major breakthrough in technological advancements came from the launch of the K-Series magnetic square filter holder system in 2017. The sole quest for everyone at H&Y, is to produce the most economically advanced range of accessories for Photographers & Videographers and this was the first step! 
 Kenny, the chief and brains behind the design, has spent many waking hours perfecting the REVORING, but like all good product ideas, we have had to go through months of testing and design changes to reach this point! From the very beginning, we called upon our ambassadors to get involved in helping us manoeuvre through the slalom of fine-tuning the REVORING to make sure it was the amazing product it was always designed to be.We turned to Kickstarter and Indiegogo for its historical success in brining new photographic innovations to life, and for the positive impact the backer community can have on a brand new concept and design. We have worked our way through many prototypes and samples so that we can perfect our design. Many new features have been added along the way, with more confirmed still to come! We are pretty confident you are going to love the REVORING!",42.0,3,"1 Campaign

</p><p>Hi guys, my name is Lex! </p>
<p>I am an overweight college student
trying desperately to lose weight and inspire others along the way to both get
healthier, but also accept their flaws. After being teased from the age of nine
about my weight, I’m putting my foot down and saying enough is enough. I use
YouTube as my media platform to connect with others. If you’d like to see more
of me and see what I’m all about, my username is LexBiagini. Check me out!</p>
<p>Currently I am operating on an
old, shitty camera that affects the quality of my videos. I am hoping to raise
money to purchase a better camera for your viewing pleasure! With a better
quality camera I can also diversify my videos more since I would be able to
film things in greater detail.</p>
<p>If I don’t reach my goal of $2000
through this fundraiser, I will set the moeny aside until I have put away
enough of my own money to buy a high quality camera. I assure you, the money
will not be wasted nor spent on anything other than things to better my YouTube
channel.</p>
<p>As I’m sure a lot of us probably
already know, losing weight is hard and I have tried and failed many times, but
with the support of all of my fans and followers, it will be much harder to
give up on myself knowing that you all are pushing me forward. I promise to
reward all of your support with lots of pictures and videos of my soon-to-be
SMOKING hot body!</p>

You can use Cap to capture your life and then anyone with a VR headset can see what you see!Cap is small and only weighs 114g, so it’s perfect for carrying around anywhere you go.Cap’s battery supports 1900mAh, offering up to 120 minutes of continuous recording with a single full charge.Thanks to its field of view, aspect ratio, and image distortion that are designed to match a VR headset, Cap is the first 3D camera to create footage that can be viewed through your VR headset on any existing platform, even if the platform does not support a 3D format. With other 3D or VR cameras, the images you export from the camera cannot be watched directly—you need special software to play it with the right field-of-view, aspect ratio, and anti-distortion calibration. If a platform does not support a 3D format, you cannot upload or live-stream on that platform. That’s what makes Cap special.Cap can 3D live-stream directly to Facebook, YouTube, Periscope, Twitch, and any platform’s PC client, no matter whether the platform is 3D-enabled or not. Live-stream in 3D and start being different!Cap can help you have a 3D video chat or 3D video conference. You just need to connect Cap to a PC and run your favorite chat software, and your friend can see you in VR, which is as vivid as if you were right there with them.You can upload your 3D video or photo captured with Cap onto any existing platform. Relive your favorite memories as if you were there again!You can download raw footages captured by Cap at this link:https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14TnCioyMb0SRa0LIWETS3f0KrpMjQlH7Cap is equipped with two lenses that are bionic and designed to match the distance between human eyes. The high 4K resolution can record every detail. It imitates how your eyes capture the world and creates vivid 3D vision.Cap can transfer its view to your mobile phone from up to 65 feet away, so you can see what they’re seeing though a First Person View (FPV) vividly in 3D with a VR headset. Be your dog for a day, see life through a different view!Cap uses two microphones to simultaneously record stereophonic sound. When one mic is heard through the left earphone, and the other mic through the right, it creates a pleasant sense of width that is absent in a mono recording.With Cap’s time-lapse function, you can create time-lapse photography easily. Just set up the shooting frequency and Cap will shoot automatically. You’ll easily get phenomenal time-lapse footage.With WiFi, you can use the Cap App to preview, control, download and re-play with your smartphone.

<p>The human eye is a very delicate organ that enables you to recognize elaborate three-dimensional views through the reception of external light. The human eyes are separated by approximately 65 mm, which is called a parallax. Your eyes naturally account for this separation when focusing on an object. However, this parallax has never been replicated in the VR functions of other 360° cameras.</p>

Meet Vuo, the first 360° 4K video camera that truly mirrors human eyesight. Vuo is equipped with two pairs of 180° lenses that are placed 65 mm apart, which is the average distance between people's eyes. This design, allows you to capture 360° around just like your natural eyes would view the world. Relive special moments with unparalleled realism through 360 social media platforms (Youtube 360, Facebook 360, Twitter 360), VR binoculars or 3D television.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Vuo offers two distinct modes. When you begin recording, if you hold Vuo vertically, it will film utilizing only two lenses in ""One-eye Mode."" Essentially, this will film videos in the same way as other 360° cameras on the market. 

If you hold Vuo horizontally, it will record with all four lenses in ""Two-eyes Mode."" The embedded gyro sensor will automatically detect how you are holding Vuo. In ""Two-eyes Mode"" you will be capable of recording stunningly realistic 3D video. 
 

 

Control Vuo manually through its simple two-button shooting controls or remotely through the companion application. Once you are finished shooting, you can edit it into different modes (VR, 360° or 3D). 

 
 

 

Content shot on Vuo can be seen through an array of viewing experiences! Use a Head Mounted Display (HMD) for an immersive visual and audio VR experience. For a more casual and affordable experience use a cardboard VR headset to view VR content from your smartphone. For 3D video content, use 3D glasses or even display it on a 3D TV for images and videos that pop right out of the screen!

Share your content with friends or family on various social media platforms directly from the Vuo application. Sharing can be done instantaneously to Instagram or 360 compatible platforms such as Facebook 360 & Youtube 360.

Rani takes photographs and writes a summary of the protests and posts it online keeping hundreds around the world updated on Bil'in. Rani does all this in a wheelchair because he was shot by an Israeli army sniper during a student demonstration in Ramallah on the second day of the second intifada, September 30, 2000.</p><p>In recent months Rani's wheelchairs and camera have been broken during attacks by Israeli soldiers at the weekly protests. On June 7th 2014 Israeli soldiers attacked a group of journalists at the demonstration, including Rani, and broke their cameras. A few weeks later on July 14th, 2014, Israeli soldiers beat Rani again; this time breaking his last remaining 'backup' wheelchair. Rani's more suitable chair had been broken for a while, which has happened many times before, either because of attacks or because the village's rugged terrain is too rough on it.</p><p>Rani does not receive financial assistance due to his injuries though he needs and pays for care beyond these two wheelchairs. Along with his wife Hanadi he is also raising a set of 5 year old triplets, two girls and a boy, which leaves little extra time and funds for his own care. Their home is always a welcoming place for anyone coming to Bil'in from around the world and this campaign is a way of returning a bit of their generous hospitality. </p><p>A group of friends has stepped in to ensure Rani gets the wheelchairs replaced ASAP but this time we need financial support to do this. We'd also like to see Rani's camera replaced and give him and his family further support as well. This would mean that at least in the near future and especially during these turbulent days they can have a little peace of mind and keep doing all the great things they already do.</p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Where your funding will go:</p><p>$3,000 will get Rani a new suitable wheelchair.</p><p>$1,500 will replace Rani's spare wheelchair.</p><p>$4,500 will replace Rani's camera.</p><p>$6,000 would allow Rani a better level of care and his family basic financial security for the next year or so.</p><p><b>$15,000 TOTAL</b></p><p>If the goal isn't reached, all the money raised (minus indiegogo and bank charges) will be spent in the order listed above: wheelchairs first, then camera (so Rani can keep working) and anything extra will go to cover ongoing medical costs and basic financial security.</p><p>Because of the time and costs involved in giving perks to funders we've decided to avoid them in order to ensure that the maximum percentage of funding goes right to Rani and his family. But, funders and supporters and encouraged to:</p><p>1. Email Rani at raniab281@yahoo.com and ask to sign up for his news updates.</p><p>2. Check out a website setup by friends for periodic updates at:<a href=""http://friendsofrani.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://friendsofrani.wordpress.com</a></p><p>3.  Visit Bil'in! Pay Rani a visit and you will undoubtedly receive generous hospitality along with a good laugh.</p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>As the economy and social assistance in Palestine is in shambles there are many Palestinian individuals and families in great need of similar support. During this time of Israel's war on Gaza we especially encourage you to support Palestinians there as well. Still, your support for Rani's young family will mean ensuring his health, mobility and employment. It helps further the family along the path to becoming self-sustainable, something that should be a given for everyone, without having to ask for help. That is exactly what Rani is working toward, along with the hundreds of people he updates on Bil'in Village's resistance and your contribution will keep him rolling!</p><p></p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>There are very few risks and challenges involved in this campaign because the friends of Rani who are managing it on the ground have completed all the necessary functions before. Also thanks to this platform all the funds will go directly into Rani's bank account once the campaign has ended, so there will be no need for complicated international funds transfers, and Rani can get on with his life as quickly as possible.</p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>We realize these are not the simples financial times for many, even outside of Palestine, so if you can't contribute please talk about this campaign with your friends, family and any other group you take part in! Please also share it online using indiegogo's share tool or just by copying and pasting where possible.</p><p>And finally, know your support and funding are both very much appreciated, THANK YOU!</p><p>If you'd like to contact us for any reason please send an email to: ronamerrill[at]yahoo.com or raniab281[at]yahoo.com</p></div>","Short SummaryRani Burnat from Bil'in Village in the West Bank, has been participating in and documenting the village's weekly protests against the wall and settlements for nearly a decade.

This would mean that at least in the near future and especially during these turbulent days they can have a little peace of mind and keep doing all the great things they already do.What We Need & What You GetWhere your funding will go:$3,000 will get Rani a new suitable wheelchair.$1,500 will replace Rani's spare wheelchair.$4,500 will replace Rani's camera.$6,000 would allow Rani a better level of care and his family basic financial security for the next year or so.$15,000 TOTALIf the goal isn't reached, all the money raised (minus indiegogo and bank charges) will be spent in the order listed above: wheelchairs first, then camera (so Rani can keep working) and anything extra will go to cover ongoing medical costs and basic financial security.Because of the time and costs involved in giving perks to funders we've decided to avoid them in order to ensure that the maximum percentage of funding goes right to Rani and his family. But, funders and supporters and encouraged to:1. Email Rani at raniab281@yahoo.com and ask to sign up for his news updates.2. Check out a website setup by friends for periodic updates at:http://friendsofrani.wordpress.com3.  Visit Bil'in! Pay Rani a visit and you will undoubtedly receive generous hospitality along with a good laugh.The ImpactAs the economy and social assistance in Palestine is in shambles there are many Palestinian individuals and families in great need of similar support. During this time of Israel's war on Gaza we especially encourage you to support Palestinians there as well. Still, your support for Rani's young family will mean ensuring his health, mobility and employment. It helps further the family along the path to becoming self-sustainable, something that should be a given for everyone, without having to ask for help. That is exactly what Rani is working toward, along with the hundreds of people he updates on Bil'in Village's resistance and your contribution will keep him rolling!Risks & ChallengesThere are very few risks and challenges involved in this campaign because the friends of Rani who are managing it on the ground have completed all the necessary functions before. Also thanks to this platform all the funds will go directly into Rani's bank account once the campaign has ended, so there will be no need for complicated international funds transfers, and Rani can get on with his life as quickly as possible.Other Ways You Can HelpWe realize these are not the simples financial times for many, even outside of Palestine, so if you can't contribute please talk about this campaign with your friends, family and any other group you take part in! Please also share it online using indiegogo's share tool or just by copying and pasting where possible.And finally, know your support and funding are both very much appreciated, THANK YOU!If you'd like to contact us for any reason please send an email to: ronamerrill[at]yahoo.com or raniab281[at]yahoo.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

 NANO1 system (in red) versus alternatives Foreword In 2014, I took a trip to see the night skies with the National University of Singapore. Growing up in an urban city like Singapore, it was my first experience of the rural night skies. The inky black sky was filled with stars and the Milky Way spanned across the horizon. It was an impressive sight for a city dweller like me and I wanted to capture and share it with my friends and family. Seeing the Milky Way for the first time is an out of this world experienceAs a professional photographer, astronomy imaging should be straightforward, but it wasn't. Astronomy imaging was difficult and complex, with technical concepts not common to “everyday” photography.  With the help from local astronomers, I learned how to capture and process images of the night skies, and with their help I want to make a camera that simplifies astronomy imaging for you.We created the NANO1 astronomy camera to make astronomy imaging small, smart and social. It uses an augmented reality star map to guide you across the constellations, astronomy exposure preset to simplify astronomy image settings and WiFi control and file transfer to share your images through your smartphone.Back us to put the wonders of the night sky and exploration in the hands of everyone. - Grey Tan, FounderAs Seen On Astronomy sharing at TEDxUbud   Captured by NANO1 Working prototype demonstration of features.Milky Way shot using our kit lens in Mersing, Malaysia as part of our early prototype test. Images of the Moon and Singapore's skyline using adapted telephoto lenses. 1400mm F2?

We've created a utility that will be made available, to convert the RAW file to DNG.Further reading on NANO1 design https://www.tinymos.com/nano1/2018/10/19/nano1-astronomy

<p>Hi, my name is Adam Warner and I'm a photographer. In high school I took a photography class as a required fine arts credit, and I used a family members Ricoh 35mm camera... I was hooked. For the next 10 or so years, I played with more 35mm cameras, polaroids, 110mm cameras, dark room development and learning as much as I could. </p>
<p>In 2005, I moved into the digital photography world and launched AAH Photography. I photographed flowers, landscapes, babies and children, models and weddings. In 2006, I launched Beholder Media where I photographed live music, bands and concerts. In 2007, I started photographing fashion models, runway fashion, marathons, sports and special events. In 2009, I changed AAH to simply Adam Warner Photography; the way it should have been from the start. In 2010, I took the leap to become a full-time photographer. This full-time endeavor brought a wide variety of clients, corporate portraits, bigger weddings, more live music, commercial photography, family portraits, landscape commission photography, and even some food photography.</p>
<p>Then in March 2012, a friend of mine was scheduled to shoot his first wedding and came over to get a wealth of advice. He also asked if he could use my Canon 70-200mm f/2.8L IS USM lens which I said was fine, I always like helping a friend. A few hours later he informed me that it had been stolen out of his car. I was devastated, it was as if I had just lost an extension of my body. The cost of replacing this fine piece of equipment, $2,200. This is where I need your help, without this lens, I cannot produce the amazing photographs that my clients, friends, family and fans have come to love. Even the minimum $10 donation helps me get that much closer to reaching my goal. Every single donation will get you an original 8x10 Adam Warner Photography print, plus other services depending on the level of your charity. Please take a look at the donations levels on this page and see if there is a way that we can help each other. Thank you very much.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Andrew Pan. I am an aspiring fashion and portrait photographer from Greensboro, NC.<br/>This campaign is to help me get a much needed camera upgrade. All the photos seen in the montage I have provided are taken with my first (and current) DSLR camera the Nikon D60 that I recieved as a gift in 2009. On January 26th, 2013, the camera's shutter died thus rendering the camera unusable. The cost of the shutter plus labor and shipping is not worth saving it, no matter how much I love it. <br/><br/>In fall, 2013 I hope to return to my studies in order to gain a degree in Commercial photography from Randolph Community College in Asheboro North Carolina.<br/><br/>This campaign will be used to upgrade to the camera in which I will be using for my schooling and work which will give me much better picture quality and will also provide a professional way of video recording which is a avenue that most photographers nowadays need to be familiar with (and an avenue that I am extremely familiar with!)<br/><br/>Having my funds met would allow me to continue my pursuit in this career and will also provide me the chance to better my self, my portfolio and my career. I am hoping that with this upgrade I will be able to shoot my undergrad and graduate portfolio(s). This will give me the best chance to move foreward in the education of this field.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I have been searching for a descent standalone camera gimbal stabilizer for my camera gimbal.  I've tried using a number of products like the FY30 with average results because they were never really designed for the purpose.  Other purpose made products like the PicLoc are never in stock, and people have reported mixed results.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I've been a member on DIYDrones for a while so posted a blog offering a reward of $100 for the first person to write some code to make an ArduIMU into a camera gimbal stabilizer.  Other members on DIYDrones joined and offered to contribute.  Its getting hard to track the pledges so I have created this project.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Other products like the PicLoc are always out of stock and people have had mixed results.
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Some multicopter/autopilot systems have camera stabilization 
functions, however sometimes you just need a standalone stabilizer that 
mounts onto the gimbal.  For example a 360 pan gimbal would not allow a 
cable to run up to the multicopter without fouling the cables when the 
camera operator</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I know that ArduCopter has gimbal stabilization code in it, however, its
 designed to work on the APM and isn't standalone.  I also know that 
ArduIMU is a standalone IMU which can drive servos and receive R/C 
signals.  So I thought if someone could migrate migrate and improve the 
ArduCopters gimbal stabilization code onto an ArduIMU, it would be a 
fantastic</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Project backers will make sure that the programmer is rewarded to make this software.   The code will be released as open source, so as a contributor you will help make this happen.  Contributions upto $199 will go directly to the programmer.</p>
<br/>Funders/backers will get to vote which programmer gets the money based upon the best app.<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>I have added some perks for people who are just too lazy to try to compile the code and assembly the ArduIMU.  Those who want a plug and play setup can contribute $200+.  $100 will go towards the programmer, the rest will go towards the hardware cost.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The Specifications of the Stabilizer</h3>

</div></div>","Our Story
I have been searching for a descent standalone camera gimbal stabilizer for my camera gimbal.  I've tried using a number of products like the FY30 with average results because they were never really designed for the purpose.  Other purpose made products like the PicLoc are never in stock, and people have reported mixed results.

I've been a member on DIYDrones for a while so posted a blog offering a reward of $100 for the first person to write some code to make an ArduIMU into a camera gimbal stabilizer.  Other members on DIYDrones joined and offered to contribute.  Its getting hard to track the pledges so I have created this project.

The Impact


Other products like the PicLoc are always out of stock and people have had mixed results.


Some multicopter/autopilot systems have camera stabilization 
functions, however sometimes you just need a standalone stabilizer that 
mounts onto the gimbal.  For example a 360 pan gimbal would not allow a 
cable to run up to the multicopter without fouling the cables when the 
camera operator

I know that ArduCopter has gimbal stabilization code in it, however, its
 designed to work on the APM and isn't standalone.  I also know that 
ArduIMU is a standalone IMU which can drive servos and receive R/C 
signals.  So I thought if someone could migrate migrate and improve the 
ArduCopters gimbal stabilization code onto an ArduIMU, it would be a 
fantastic


What We Need & What You Get
Project backers will make sure that the programmer is rewarded to make this software.   The code will be released as open source, so as a contributor you will help make this happen.  Contributions upto $199 will go directly to the programmer.
Funders/backers will get to vote which programmer gets the money based upon the best app.
I have added some perks for people who are just too lazy to try to compile the code and assembly the ArduIMU.  Those who want a plug and play setup can contribute $200+.  $100 will go towards the programmer, the rest will go towards the hardware cost.

The Specifications of the Stabilizer
Mandatory requirements (programmer must deliver these):
2 x channel PWM in and out to control the camera gimbals roll and pitch using a standard R/C RX and servos

<h3>So, Lets All Be Honest Here:</h3>
<p>A few months back, my lovely Neon was in a bit of a pickle, barely getting me to and from work.  I looked around, and the only thing that I could sell that would bring me any sort of money was my camera rig.  And, though my heart was yelling at me, telling me not to, I sold the whole rig.  </p>
<p>With the weather beginning to warm up, and actually having time off, I'm already feeling the itch of needing to go out and shoot - and continue working on a project I was working on prior to selling.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I'd Like to Do:</h3>
<p>So if by some miracle you're still reading, cool! Towards the end of my time with my camera, I found myself really getting into not only HDR photography, but photographing the City of Detroit.  Both it's beauty and it's destruction.  I took several trips to the Packard Plant, Fisher Body Plant, and a few other misc abandoned buildings in the city.  Most of these buildings were forgotten long ago by all but the artists who turned these walls into their canvases.</p>
<p>I want to continue on with this vision, and attempt to capture Detroit in a different light than it is generally portrayed.  I'd like to use a mixture of my love for the city and the wonderful process of HDR to bring to life the city that so many have forgotten.</p>
<p>Art is something I've always been passionate about - weather it be music or photography.  The thing for me with photography has always been the ability to tell an entire story, simply with one single image.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>So, Where's My Money Actually Going?</h3>
<p>This is an understandable question.  There are a few things that I'll be purchasing with the funds.  All of the funds raised will go directly to the costs of the camera and accessories, as well as fulfilling the tier rewards and shipping.</p>
<ol>
<li>Canon Rebel T3i kit with 18-55mm lens</li>
<li>Tamron 10-24mm Super Wide-Angle </li>
<li>Battery Grip with Spare Batteries.</li>
<li>Camera Bag</li>
<li>Camera Strap</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if we manage to pass the goal, I'll go with a newer/updated body. The Tamron lens is absolutely beautiful and was my go-to lense before I sold my rig, so that is the lense I'm going to be getting no matter what body I go with.  The other bits are dependant on what we raise.  The body and lense are the main concerns, obviously.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What Do I Get Out of This Other Than Making You Happy?</h3>
<p>Well, first and formost, any single dollar that you can give will be so appreciated it's not even funny.  What I've decided to offer you are different prints from once I make my way into the city to shoot.  The higher up the tiers you go, the larger the prints are and the more shots you will get. </p>
<p>Once I receive my camera and make my way out and edit, I will post all of my shots in a dedicated gallery for your viewing pleasure and for you to select which prints you want and in what size brackets.  I will be able to do everything from a 4x6 postcard type shot, to a full poster-sized canvas print.  All prints will be done at Kinkos, and that price is rolled into what the money will go to - because printing isn't cheap.  </p>
<h3>But I can't afford to give you moneys right now! :(</h3>
<p>That's okay! I completely understand that times are tough right now.  But if you are unable to donate any thing to this campaign, I totally understand.  I just ask that you share this page with your friends and family. Even having someone looking and seeing what it is that I'm trying to do gives me hope that I will be able to continue follow this dream that I have. </p>

Their original purpose is to block UV light that would cause hazing in old film photos. Even modern films before digital photography are immune from UV light, digital cameras are not sensitive with UV light either.In the meantime, users believe having a relative inexpensive filter in front of their expensive lens could provide some levels of protection, thus UV filters today are still widely used as a protection filter and they are the first accessory to buy with a purchase of a new lens.However, most UV filters and protection filters in the market are made from a piece of thin glass. They offer little physical protection since the filter glass is easy to be broken, as discovered by users who have dropped their filters by accident.
        The PowerUV protection filters from Aurora Aperture are real UV filters that can truly protect. They are made from chemically harden glass that offers much stronger protection than normal glass.  
      We choose the Corning® Gorilla® Glass 3 for the PowerUV protection filter, as it is the most widely used cover glass today in smartphones and tablets. Chemically harden glass is a proven and matured technology, adopting it to camera lens filter is only a matter of time.    To demonstrate the impact resistant capability of the Gorilla® Glass 3 based PowerUV filters, we conduct a drop-ball test. The drop-ball test is based on the ANSI Z87.1-2003 standard which is used in the FDA 21 CFR 801.410 regulation. The original purpose of this test is for eyeglass certification and has been used over forty years. All eyeglasses and sunglasses sold in the US must pass this drop ball test.In this impact test, a 5/8-inch steel ball weighting approximately 0.56 ounce (about 16 grams) is dropped from a height of 50 inches (about 1.27 meters) upon the surface of test target, and the test target must not be fractured.    First, we gather a few traditional UV filters and put them through the drop-ball test.   As seen from above, all these UV filters failed the drop ball test, including a few premium brand filters such as Kenko Pro1D UV and B+W XS-Pro UV. Some UV filters did not even pass the test with a smaller steel ball of 7g, or less than half of the standard weight at 16g.   There is no surprise for this, since these filters are not built as real protection filters from the first place. We just want to use the test to break the illusion of traditional UV filters can provide protection to camera lenses. Now we put our PowerUV filter through the same drop-ball test. Not only it passed the standard test with flying color, we tried to break it by increasing the weight of the steel ball to 2 ounces (56 grams) , our Gorilla® Glass 3 based filters still pass the test. That is up to 3.5 times of standard test weight and 8 times of certain ultra thin UV filter failed limit.  As a comparison, we also tested a Sigma Ceramic Protector filter which is made from clear glass ceramic and is supposed to be stronger than normal glass . Although the Sigma protection filter did pass the standard test at 16 grams, it failed at the weight of 56 gram.   Next is a scratch test. We put the PowerUV filter with a bunch of hard objects such as small rocks, keys, and pocket knife into a container on a vibration platform. We let it run through 30 minutes of vibration time and the filter will be examined for surface scratch.Again, the PowerUV filters survive the scratch simulation test with flying colors.   Traditional UV Filter manufactures market their premium filters by emphasizing the use of high quality optic glasses such as Schott B270®. Does the chemically harder glass materials such as Gorilla® Glass compromise optical performance when comparing B270®?For UV filters, the most important optical performance metric is the transmittance rate for the visible spectrum (390nm to 700nm). Untreated optic glass such as Schott B270® is rated at 91.7%. After anti-reflection coating is applied the transmittance rate can be increased to 98% - 99%. Raw Gorilla® Glass 3 is rated at 92.3%. After applying multi layers of nano coatings our Gorilla® Glass 3 based PowerUV filters can achieve 99.6%, just as good as those traditional premium optic glass based UV filters.  
 We also conducted thorough testings in resolution and color reproduction and we find the Gorilla® Glass 3 based PowerUV filters are just as good as high quality UV filters built with Schott B270® glass.Another optical aspect of UV filters is its anti ghost capability. Ghosting is caused by light reflections between an UV filter and a lens. We conducted ghost tests with the PowerUV filters and found no particular issue with the Gorilla® Glass 3 material. The multi layer nano coatings not only help increasing the transmittance rate, but also repels water, oil, and dust. Contaminants can be wiped off from the filters easily.     
  UV filters frame design is very simple as there is just a metal frame housing a single piece of glass and yet we have seen many UV filters with thick frames that serve no practical purpose but causing vignetting in wide angle lenses. Our PowerUV filter frame design is simple and effective, even with our relative thick Gorilla® Glass to provide extra protection, the overall thickness of our PowerUV filter is only 3.6mm, thinner than many UV filters in the market.   The PowerUV filters are built from aerospace grade aluminum with CNC machinery for utmost precision and accuracy. They are anodized for durability.   With up to 8 times stronger than normal UV filters, the Aurora PowerUV is the toughest UV filter in the world*. Your camera lens deserves the same level of protection as your eyes.   
 The Aurora PowerCPL filters are also based on the Gorilla® Glass 3 technology, with the same polishing technique we used in our successful PowerXND 2000 filters. 
   
 With proliferations of digital cameras and photo editing software, many special effect filters are obsolete except a few specialized filters such as circular polarizer (CPL) filters and neutral density (ND) filters. A CPL filter is an indispensable tool that photographers and videographers should have. By using CPL filters in photography and videography, certain effects can be obtained that would not be possible by using software in post processing. A CPL filter can filter out polarized light, making a sky bluer and vegetation color more saturated.  Another CPL application is to reduce reflection from non-metallic surface such as water surface or window.As shown here, by using a CPL filter, the rocks underneath the water can be seen once the light reflection from the water surface is removed.    Here is another example, a CPL reduces the light reflection from the background, thus making the main subject, a dragonfly sitting on top of a lotus bud “pops”.    The PowerCPL filters are based on Gorilla® Glass 3 for the extra strength, and they are multi-layer coated with nano technology.One of most important aspects of our PowerCPL filters is its super optical quality which translates into high resolution and realistic color reproduction . By using proprietary polishing technique and rigorous quality control process such as using collimator to test CPL glasses, our PowerCPL filters achieve excellent resolution and color reproduction accuracy as shown by the test results from an Imatest certified lab.    In the Imatest SFR resolution test, the reference resolution in this test setup is 2939 line width per (test target picture) height, the Aurora PowerCPL resolution is 2880 LW/PH, or 98% of the referenced resolution, slightly behind a premium priced CPL filter.Here is a visual comparison of PowerCPL filter and a low price CPL filter (Green.L) , shot with a Nikon Nikkor AF-S 300mm f/4E PF ED VR on a Nikon D810 camera viewed at 100%. In the Imatest SFR test results, the Green.L resolution is only 80%of the referenced resolution and there is clearly visible blurring in the comparison image below.      
  The Aurora PowerCPL frame features an user friendly anti-lockup design to prevent “stuck filter” phenomenon common in thin profile CPL filters. Many slim profile CPL filters have a very thin fixed ring so the filter may be stuck on a lens and become very hard to be removed.   We increase the fixed ring thickness so putting the CPL filter on and off a lens is easier and less likely to get stuck. In the meantime, the overall filter profile remains the same so vignetting is kept to minimum.  The PowerCPL filters are built from aerospace grade aluminum with CNC machinery for utmost precision and accuracy. They are anodized for durability.Wide temperature range lubricant is applied to the filter so it will have smooth and dampened rotation throughout the temperature range.

*As July 5th, 2016    With the best impact and scratch resistant capabilities, we could have priced the PowerUV and PowerCPL filters at a premium. However, we would like to have as many photographers as possible to try out the toughest UV protectors and the high resolution CPL filters. Thus we choose to price our PowerUV and PowerCPL filters very competitively, at the level of filters without such capabilities.  And we go one step further to make the PowerUV and PowerCPL filters available to Indiegogo contributors with 35% off the already competitive MSRP. We provide perks of 18 sizes of PowerUV protection filter  and 18 sizes of PowerCPL filter. If you simply want to pledge one filter, either PowerUV or PowerCPL, just select the one you like.   For contributors who would like to have more than one filter, such as multiple UV filters or combination of UV and CPL filters, you can choose one perks at a time per transaction, i.e. you select another perk after order a perk already. If you are going to order several perks, say three or more filters, and do not want to place order one by one, please send us a message so we can create a custom perk specifically for you. The perk will be only visible to you. Feel free to send us a message if you have any question: info@aurora-aperture.com You can change your pledge such as different type or size of filters  before the project’s funding deadline. Please follow this How to Upgrade Your Perk article for instructions. Worldwide Shipping is free.   Some of you missed our PowerXND 2000 project and express desire to order the filters with a special discount here. So we are going to make a special offer of the PowerXND 2000 filters to the supporters of this project at 10% discount. You can order the PowerXND 2000 filters in this Indiegogo InDemand page: PowerXND 2000 InDemand Order Page. Most sizes are ready to be shipped.The sales special runs through this campaign for the month of August.          Both PowerUV and PowerCPL filters have been prototyped and tested. We are ready to start production once the funding is secured. We plan on shipping products in October or earlier.Here is a video clip of our supplier factory tour made in May 2016.  Featured In",39.0,5,"3 Campaigns

The APPs are ready for operation and will be released before the shipping. How do you know how much power is left in the batteries?You can see the battery status on the screen, or in the App. How do you know how much memory is remaining? You can see the remaining storage status on the screen, or in the App. Does Moka360 come with a memory card?No, we are not including a memory card with your order. Will a charging cable come with Moka360?Yes, each package will include a Micro USB for charging. What are the ratings for the waterproof case?135 feet/40 meters with waterproof case, could work with or without the back battery. How many hours will Moka360 last if only used for taking pictures?There are many factors and conditions to calculate this, but generally the battery life should last you for more than 1 day. Can Moka360 connect to a microphone through a 3.5mm mic adapter?Moka360 does not have a 3.5mm port because we are trying to keep the camera as small as possible. Can Moka360 handle extreme temperatures?Yes, Moka360 has been tested to work at -20C degrees. Is Moka360 compatible with a standard tripod?Yes, the base of Moka360 includes a standard 1/4 inch screw slot. How long will it take to completely charge the internal camera battery?This depends on the type of charger you are using, but generally it will take 2 hours. What is the Battery Life (estimated time) of Moka360?Video recording is estimated at 1h 30m. What is the WIFI range?WIFI range is about 10m - 20m. Is the focus automatic? Or is that done also through the screen?Focus is automatic. Moka360 can charge on 100-220 volts right?The Moka360 should not be charged on 100-220 volt, it should be charged by a Micro-USB cable, which means it depends on the USB adapter in your region. Is it possible to use a Bluetooth remote?Moka360 provides remote control via 2.4G, which is more stable than Bluetooth. Can Mokacam be controlled by Mokacam4K's remote controller?Moka360 can only be controlled with the wireless Moka360 remote control Payments and ShippingHow confident are you that you can deliver on time?This is the 2nd campaign of Team Mokacam; we have built closer relationships with our manufacturing partners and the fulfillment vendors. The prototype of Moka360 was ready months ago and extensive testing has already been performed. The molds for Moka360 are much simpler compared with Mokacam4K, which was designed to be SplashProof, and the molds are super complicated and caused the delay. We are confident in our ability to meet the timeline. Although unforeseen obstacles can arise during any manufacturing process, we intend to run everything efficiently, transparently. How much is shipping?We ship worldwide and the cost is $20. Can I pick the camera up in Mokacam office and avoid the shipping charge?Sorry, we'd love to meet you, but the cameras are shipped from our manufacturing partners by air. We have to pay shipping on every camera.  When does it ship?The estimated shipping date is March 2017. Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT?The backer is responsible; please check your country's import duties before purchasing. It should be 0% in the US and varies internationally. You can check this comprehensive list to get started. Can I get a refund?Please refer to IndieGoGo's policy here. Risks and challengesWhile we're doing a lot of the work ourselves, obviously we have to rely on others (manufacture, shipping) to provide their end. We're confident that these parts will be no problem, as we're talking to established companies here. We will also go to China ourselves to oversee production, and Shuo has worked with the factory we wish to use before, so communication between us and the factory will not be an issue. But talking to other people who have run Indiegogo, there is always something that comes up, be it customs, shipping, the manufacturing not being up to scratch or any other of the many things that can delay the process. We will do our best, and hope to deliver on time, and whatever happens we will keep you updated every step along the way.We will definitely deliver a great product, and hope to do so on time!Thanks from the whole team :) Legal Disclaimer""Delivery of rewards/perks are subject to best efforts and not guaranteed.""",32.0,1,"5 Campaigns

We want to present you our new little Fun Gadget for smartphones.<br/>This is a small helicopter in pen form which allows pictures or videos to be taken from a height of up to 10 metres in HD format from all possible perspectives.<br/><br/><h2 style=""color: #f09014;""><b>Why we came up with the idea?</b></h2>
</div>During a party, we wanted to take a few photos but not those that you would normally take .... some from different angles. <br/>But we were too stupid to know how to do this. So we were climbing on furniture and walls and anything else we could find which could have been dangerous <br/>and breaking things in the process.<br/><br/>We had been thinking about a simpler and safer way of doing this.<br/>A look on the internet revealed that there are various options in the form of small helicopters or multicopters but these were very unwieldy. <br/>Finally  we  came up with the idea of designing a small Pocketcopter in pen form which  can be taken with you as a small gadget in your pocket anywhere you go<br/> and easily connect to your Smartphone to take pictures and videos wherever you are. <br/><br/><h4 style=""color: #f09014;"">Inspired by this video</h4>This video is in german but it shows why we came up with this idea<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FjRzD9QoEhxw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DjRzD9QoEhxw&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FjRzD9QoEhxw%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/><h2 style=""color: #f09014;"">For who is this gadget is useful?</h2>Well, this question is easy to answer. For Everyone! Anyone who loves to take pictures or videos can take advantage of and enjoy the extra dimension offered by the Pocketcopter.<br/>The Pocketcopter is very versatile. Whether for holidays, parties, business or just for fun.<br/>And  if you want to use it other than in flight mode the rotors can be folded in and the device used as a hand held camera or attached to a helmet.<br/><br/><p></p><h3 style=""color: #f09014;"">Taking Pictures or Videos and Sharing on Social Networks</h3>
<span>
<p>The Pocketcopter gives you many options for taking pictures or videos and allows you to
 share to your favourite social network.</p>

<br/></span><h2 style=""color: #f09014;"">How does the Pocketcopter work?</h2><p>The Pocketcopter itself is powered by a 12V battery (rechargeable or replaceable) and is controlled via the touch screen of your smartphone.<br/></p><br/>The connection is via WiFi (similar to the remote control of the GoPro) or Bluetooth.<br/>Due to the fact that, although the rotor arms are fixed one above the other, each spins in the opposite direction to the other thus achieving stability<br/> and ensuring quiet recordings.<br/><br/>Should the Pocketcopter lose the connection to the smartphone it automatically floats slowly to the ground.<br/><br/>The software interfaces will allow the pictures or videos taken to be instantly shared directly on social networks like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.<br/><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/760963/files/20140802031340-this2.jpg?1406974420"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h2 style=""color: #f09014;"">Specifications</h2><ul>

We want to present you our new little Fun Gadget for smartphones.This is a small helicopter in pen form which allows pictures or videos to be taken from a height of up to 10 metres in HD format from all possible perspectives.Why we came up with the idea?
During a party, we wanted to take a few photos but not those that you would normally take .... some from different angles. But we were too stupid to know how to do this. So we were climbing on furniture and walls and anything else we could find which could have been dangerous and breaking things in the process.We had been thinking about a simpler and safer way of doing this.A look on the internet revealed that there are various options in the form of small helicopters or multicopters but these were very unwieldy. Finally  we  came up with the idea of designing a small Pocketcopter in pen form which  can be taken with you as a small gadget in your pocket anywhere you go and easily connect to your Smartphone to take pictures and videos wherever you are. Inspired by this videoThis video is in german but it shows why we came up with this ideaFor who is this gadget is useful?Well, this question is easy to answer. For Everyone! Anyone who loves to take pictures or videos can take advantage of and enjoy the extra dimension offered by the Pocketcopter.The Pocketcopter is very versatile. Whether for holidays, parties, business or just for fun.And  if you want to use it other than in flight mode the rotors can be folded in and the device used as a hand held camera or attached to a helmet.Taking Pictures or Videos and Sharing on Social Networks

The Pocketcopter gives you many options for taking pictures or videos and allows you to
 share to your favourite social network.


How does the Pocketcopter work?The Pocketcopter itself is powered by a 12V battery (rechargeable or replaceable) and is controlled via the touch screen of your smartphone.The connection is via WiFi (similar to the remote control of the GoPro) or Bluetooth.Due to the fact that, although the rotor arms are fixed one above the other, each spins in the opposite direction to the other thus achieving stability and ensuring quiet recordings.Should the Pocketcopter lose the connection to the smartphone it automatically floats slowly to the ground.The software interfaces will allow the pictures or videos taken to be instantly shared directly on social networks like Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.Specifications
Height about 19 cm
Diameter about 4.5 cm
12V rechargeable
3D HD camera
Range about 10 meters
Rotor blades removable

As I walked backwards (carefully, I might add) I stepped onto a piece of the stage that hadn't been properly secured by the hotel's staff - it rolled out from under my foot, slamming my leg into the side of the stage and knocking me off the stage and onto my back.

They referred us to their insurance company, who then spent nearly a month running us in circles before denying our claim outright. Our adjuster is a really, really nasty woman who said directly on day one of the claim that she was likely going to deny it, on no basis whatsoever. When the insurance company contacted the hotel, who'd previously said they'd deal with it through insurance, they said they had no knowledge of the incident and we are likely liable.

I don't know what our chances really are - this will require legal counsel, which could cost more. I do not have specifics, but understand that FA:U runs on thin-to-no margins, and we don't really have the money to float a near $2500 repair bill for a donated camera, as much as we'd like to.

He shows up, works incredibly hard, is always smiling and is a source of good energy on any crew that he's a part of - even now, he's been incredibly kind, patient and understanding with what is a considerable mess for him. He gives a huge amount to the fandom; I'm just asking that we all help him out.</div><h1>I'm doing this on my own.</h1><div>Freezeframe hasn't asked me to do this. I haven't cleared this with Dragoneer, FA:U or FA. I'm doing this because I really think Freezeframe deserves to have this weight off his shoulders.

</div></div>","QooCam is the world’s first 4K camera that combines the most innovative features of both 360° & 3D stereo filming technology. Thanks to its unique 3 lenses, IMU stabilizer, and cutting-edge depthmap tech, QooCam features shake free, after-shooting refocus, 120 FPS, and time-lapse capabilities. Doesn’t matter if you are a professional or just getting started, you can freely direct and edit all your moments like a pro with QooCam’s Master Editor app. 
 
 
  QooCam is designed for recording 4K videos and photos with a full 360° range. Thanks to its 4K with full sensor readout, you can record the memorable moments in great details and create high quality 360 videos on the go.PS: 360º 4K means the entire 360º video or photo is in 4K resolution. However, since you can only view the 360º video or photo in the different field of view and not the whole image, the content quality you’re watching on the traditional sized screen is going to be less than 4K. 

 
Relive your moments as if you were there again with its amazing 3D 4K videos with a 180° wide angle. Capture and relive your moments like how you really experienced them the first time.

 
 
 Using the latest and most revolutionary depth-based technology, QooCam allows you to refocus photos after shooting them. When shooting in the 3D 180º mode, QooCam can estimate the distance of the subjects in the frame and generate a depth map for special effects post-filming. 
 Now, you can edit your photo and choose which the main subject of the content after shooting.  Tap on wherever you want to focus in. You will be able to create a bokeh effect, to enhance the subject in focus while giving the picture a fine background at the same time. 
 Stop compromising when creating high-speed action shots, with the built-in IMU sensor plus the real-time stabilization software technology, and in-house algorithm, you can achieve shake-free shots and smooth videos even without a physical stabilizer.

 
 

 Qoocam’s stitching free feature automatically combines the images of both the lenses into one 360° spherical image. Thanks to its real-time optical flow stitching algorithm, you can directly get the perfect stitching on your 360° photo or video with just your smartphone. 
 
 You can capture the 360° VR or 180° 3D video at 4K/60fps and 2K/120fps. You can easily create the highly used slow motion effect. There are endless possibilities for you to create with.  With the time-lapse function, you can create time-lapse photography easily. You can set up the shooting frequency and QooCam will shoot the 360º or 3D photo automatically. Get the phenomenal time-lapse footage with ease. 
 
 
 Enjoy a full 4k experience with QooCams’s three wide-angle lenses with a 216° field of view (FOV) and a f/2.2 aperture. Also with Sony’s CMOS sensor, the camera definition and battery life are improved, making it better than ever.   
 Built with a full aviation-grade anodized aluminum alloy body and CNC machined, Qoocam only weighs 170g; making it durable and good for cooling. It’s lightweight and durable body is perfect to carry around anywhere you go. 
 
 Built to last longer, Qoocam’s battery supports 2600mAh, offering up to 180 minutes of continuous recording with a single charge.
 
 You can use the external Micro SD card to expand the camera's storage up to 256GB. You’ll have more freedom to shoot and record without the fear of storage shortage. 
 
 
 With the Master Editor app, you can easily reframe and create 2D edits to your panoramic content with a simple tap and drag between the different points of views. Set the keyframes in your 360° videos and the app will automatically pan or zoom the 360° video to let you direct like a pro.   With the smart track feature, you can keep track of your focus point’s every movement in a 4K 360° video. Just select the object or subject that you want to follow and the camera will do the rest to keep the object the center of the frame. PS: This function will finish its final testings after August.  You can transform your photo or video into something out of this world. With one click, you can change the 360º images into cool tiny planet photos. You can even start a new trend craze on social media with these tiny planet selfies. 
 
 With its Easy Share function, share amazing videos with your friends on your favorite social media platform.Live stream 360° videos to show your friends your whole surrounding while you talk to them. QooCam supports USB and WiFi live streaming.        PS: This function will finish its final testing after August.

<p>It's simple. We engineered an action camera that puts pro-grade results within everyone's reach. Here's a confession--we don't plan to fight any great white sharks or skydive into a volcano any time soon. We're normal people...who are tired of having to choose between super expensive and poor quality when it comes to action cameras. And we think you are too.</p>

<p>This ain’t our first rodeo folks. We’ve been at this action camera thing for a couple years so we know what we’re up against. Some call it luck that we’ve been able to make an affordable camera with such high quality, but we’ll call it long hours, elbow grease and ingenuity.

</p>
<p>So, just how does the Gen3 ViDi action camera stack up against the competition? Well, most cameras out there in our class cost 2 or 3 times as much. I mean, how else are they going to pay for their corporate heads, their global retreats, or their marketing? You know the answer: it's built into the cost of their products. We decided to take our money (what little we have) and put every last cent into the guts of the camera. Well...we DID save a little for the cool design too. </p>
<p>We want to take the People's Action Camera to as many people as would like it--but going into major retail distribution is expensive. That's why the big brands can do it, but the small brands can't. So, here we are on Indiegogo--where all that goes out the window. We need your support to take the ViDi LCD camera to markets around the world. Since this is the first time the Gen3 ViDi is available to the public, we’re skipping the middle man and bringing it to you for way less than retail. </p>
<h1>Underwater Sample Footage</h1>
<p>Filming underwater is one of the main reasons that people buy action cameras. The ViDi LCD has a built in High Def CMOS Sensor with Low Light Resolution that increases underwater clarity especially when the sun is not shining.</p>

<h1>The New ViDi LCD vs the GoPro Hero</h1>
<p>Check out the side-by-side comparison video featuring the ViDi LCD and the GoPro Hero. We have a pretty amazing camera, but you don't have to take our word for it. You be the judge.</p>

<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""383"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/146030832"" title=""ViDi LCD vs GoPro comparison video"" width=""680""></iframe></div>
</div>
<p>The ViDi LCD comes with so many extra features that the GoPro Hero doesn't come with. Here's a list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rear LCD Display Screen (This alone is freaking amazing! The only way to make sure you got the shot you wanted, is to watch the footage.)</li>
<li>4GB Micro SD Card (Pre-installed)</li>
<li>Extension Pole (For all your selfie stick needs.)</li>
<li>Plugs into the Computer (To easily remove/edit your footage.)</li>

You betcha it does!



It's simple. We engineered an action camera that puts pro-grade results within everyone's reach. Here's a confession--we don't plan to fight any great white sharks or skydive into a volcano any time soon. We're normal people...who are tired of having to choose between super expensive and poor quality when it comes to action cameras. And we think you are too.










This ain’t our first rodeo folks. We’ve been at this action camera thing for a couple years so we know what we’re up against. Some call it luck that we’ve been able to make an affordable camera with such high quality, but we’ll call it long hours, elbow grease and ingenuity.


So, just how does the Gen3 ViDi action camera stack up against the competition? Well, most cameras out there in our class cost 2 or 3 times as much. I mean, how else are they going to pay for their corporate heads, their global retreats, or their marketing? You know the answer: it's built into the cost of their products. We decided to take our money (what little we have) and put every last cent into the guts of the camera. Well...we DID save a little for the cool design too. 
We want to take the People's Action Camera to as many people as would like it--but going into major retail distribution is expensive. That's why the big brands can do it, but the small brands can't. So, here we are on Indiegogo--where all that goes out the window. We need your support to take the ViDi LCD camera to markets around the world. Since this is the first time the Gen3 ViDi is available to the public, we’re skipping the middle man and bringing it to you for way less than retail. 
Underwater Sample Footage
Filming underwater is one of the main reasons that people buy action cameras. The ViDi LCD has a built in High Def CMOS Sensor with Low Light Resolution that increases underwater clarity especially when the sun is not shining.



The New ViDi LCD vs the GoPro Hero
Check out the side-by-side comparison video featuring the ViDi LCD and the GoPro Hero. We have a pretty amazing camera, but you don't have to take our word for it. You be the judge.



The ViDi LCD comes with so many extra features that the GoPro Hero doesn't come with. Here's a list:

Rear LCD Display Screen (This alone is freaking amazing! The only way to make sure you got the shot you wanted, is to watch the footage.)
4GB Micro SD Card (Pre-installed)
Extension Pole (For all your selfie stick needs.)
Plugs into the Computer (To easily remove/edit your footage.)
Time Lapse Video
It Floats! (Seriously it does)
1 Free Month of Shred Video (An easy drag & drop video editing software).
Did We Mention All This Was Under $100!

<h3>Everyone knows I love taking pictures at all the shows I go to. I go to as many shows as I can for the music, but there are also great friends that come along with that music. Have been going to big venues for national acts since I was a sophomore in high school, but after my divorce a few years ago, I got real big into the local music.So many amazing musicians just around the corner and even more wonderful people with them. I started taking the good camera I bought to capture the precious moments of my kids growing up to the shows with me. Turned out to be good at capturing the bands I love and the new friends I make all the time and saving these moments forever. I also share these moments that I captured with everyone so we can all enjoy and remember what a great time that show was. Well...... on Friday the 13, the image sensor went out on the camera and I managed to tear up the lens gears trying to get it to work. Only got 2 pictures that night before the show even started. Went to 5 shows that weekend and everyone was asking where my camera was. I was lost without it and felt like I was not doing my part for the metal community that I am proud to be a part of. I had that one for 8 years, so there is no warranty left and repair costs are close to the cost of a newer model camera. I am going to stick with the same series of camera as it is the best pocket camera I can get into any show with and not need a press pass to use. There were several musicians that mentioned having a benefit show or starting a fundraiser so I can replace my camera and continue to capture amazing images of my friends and the wonderful bands some of them are in, as well as the national acts that come through. Of course I will continue to share all of these with every one of you. I try never to ask for money from people and you all know I would do absolutely anything I can for any of you if I am able. Since the divorce and foreclosures, I just have no extra money at all and I am just barely getting by and proving for my kids. There are 2 different cameras in this series that I am looking at. The 1st will come out in a couple of weeks and has a newer processor that will be better at the low light shots and it has a newer image sensor than my last one, so that problem will not happen again. The 2nd one is last years model, but the image sensor is 3 times the size of the 1st one. The processor in that one is also last years, so it is not as fast as the new one. But with it being 3 times bigger, it has it's own advantages. With that size comes a cost though. The 1st one is about $600 and the 2nd one is about $800. I have set my goal at $900 to cover fees on here and shipping and tax or anything else that comes up.</h3>

<p>Both based in Switzerland, we are united by a practical approach to photography gear and a fascination for natural high quality materials. Wood as a complementary material to artificial material camera bodies provides a different feel when using your device. Improved ergonomics, low weight and the use of natural materials have been the focus of the development.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516655912/mqknb08tpggs6cje1ms9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The oiled natural material absorbs humidity from the users hands and thereby guarantees a more secure grip than conventional camera grips. Wooden grips don’t cool down or heat up as extreme as metal/plastic ones, which provides more comfort in harsh weather conditions. In order to improve daily use, a battery access has been incorporated into the design without compromising on stability or durability. During daily use, each grip will grow in character and become a personal item and develop an individual patina that will tell the story of your photographic journey.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516655794/s5ilzcgtvqls9a6o1amo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We produce in Switzerland to guarantee the best quality. The wood used is carefully selected and quality checked and then partially machine crafted for the cutting process and all the other processes are handcrafted. Therefore, beyond the signs of personal use, each grip is a unique item and will further become one as you use it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After six months of development we seek your support for this all-natural product in order to fund and start the production. We believe in the concept of a sustainable product. </p>
</div><div> <h3>What we offer</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Our funding goal is calculated for buying raw material and upgrading machines for future production. The material we need also includes wood for the grips, packaging and different tools for woodworking. In exchange for your support we offer some cool perks such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signed postcards by Jens Krauer</li>
<li>Wooden hot shoe covers</li>
<li>Early supporter Jens Krauer edition Holzgriff</li>
<li>Package consisting of Jens Krauer edition Holzgriff and hot shoe cover</li>
<li>Development of Holzgriff for different camera model</li>

</div><p> </p></div>","Christoph Untersander is a product developer and photo enthusiast, Jens Krauer is a Fujifilm X-Photographer and together we designed the wooden camera grip for the Fujifilm X-T2 camera. 
Both based in Switzerland, we are united by a practical approach to photography gear and a fascination for natural high quality materials. Wood as a complementary material to artificial material camera bodies provides a different feel when using your device. Improved ergonomics, low weight and the use of natural materials have been the focus of the development.

The oiled natural material absorbs humidity from the users hands and thereby guarantees a more secure grip than conventional camera grips. Wooden grips don’t cool down or heat up as extreme as metal/plastic ones, which provides more comfort in harsh weather conditions. In order to improve daily use, a battery access has been incorporated into the design without compromising on stability or durability. During daily use, each grip will grow in character and become a personal item and develop an individual patina that will tell the story of your photographic journey.

We produce in Switzerland to guarantee the best quality. The wood used is carefully selected and quality checked and then partially machine crafted for the cutting process and all the other processes are handcrafted. Therefore, beyond the signs of personal use, each grip is a unique item and will further become one as you use it.
 
After six months of development we seek your support for this all-natural product in order to fund and start the production. We believe in the concept of a sustainable product. 
 What we offer
 
Our funding goal is calculated for buying raw material and upgrading machines for future production. The material we need also includes wood for the grips, packaging and different tools for woodworking. In exchange for your support we offer some cool perks such as:

Signed postcards by Jens Krauer
Wooden hot shoe covers
Early supporter Jens Krauer edition Holzgriff
Package consisting of Jens Krauer edition Holzgriff and hot shoe cover
Development of Holzgriff for different camera model

 
We need a critical mass to buy materials in decent amounts and to upgrade our machines and tools. This will also allow us to work on production optimization. If we don’t reach our set goal, we will use the collected money to try to produce the promised perks.

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What does ND 16 or ND 200 mean? </p>
<p>There are two ND notation systems, one with an integer number such as ND 16, and another with a decimal number such as ND 1.2. The integer notation represents the amount of light transmittance decided by that number. For example, the light transmittance of ND 2 is 1/2 (50%) or one stop, whereas ND 16 is 1/16 (6.25%) or four stops. In other words, an ND 2000 filter only allows 1/2000 or 0.05% of the light being passed.</p>
<p>The decimal system uses 0.3 as incremental value for each stop. Thus an ND 1.2 is same as ND 16.

<p>Does my (fill in the blank) camera or lens work with PowerXND 2000 filter? <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aurora-aperture/powerxnd-2000-variable-nd-filter-with-up-to-11-sto/description#project_faq_166506"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">D</a></p>
<p>As long as the lens has a standard filter thread and it matches one of the sizes we offer, the PowerXND 2000 filter will work with your camera and lens. Some lenses do not have a filter thread such as Nikon AF-S 14-24/2.8G or Canon EF 11-24/4L, they are no supported with the PowerXND 2000 filter, yet. Some fixed lens cameras like GoPro also do not have a filter thread but there are third party filter adaptors available.</p>
<div><p></p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>When using the PowerXND 2000 filter near or at the maximum setting, the camera can not auto focus. What is the solution? </p>
<p>At the maximum setting, there is only 1/2000 or 0.05% of light entering the camera. This may be well below the camera’s AF low light limit. The solution is to put the filter at the minimum setting, perform framing and focus, lock the focus by switching focus mode to manual focus position or using other focus lock mechanism on the camera. Then carefully rotate the PowerXND 2000 front ring to the desired setting without causing the camera to move, then take a picture. In fact this is an advantage of using the PowerXND 2000 variable ND filter than using fixed ND filters since there is little chance of moving camera position by carefully rotating the front ring.</p>
<div><p></p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pictures taken with PowerXND 2000 at the maximum setting are way under exposed. Why is that? </p>
<p>This is most likely caused by the camera metering system being interfered by light leakage from the camera’s viewfinder eyepiece. At the maximum setting very little amount of light enters the camera through the lens, whereas light from the optical viewfinder at the back of the camera could leak into the camera metering system and amount of leaked light could be more than the light from the lens, thus the metering system would fail.</p>
<p>Many DSLR cameras have a viewfinder eyepiece shutter that can be closed. It’s strongly recommended to close this shutter before taking a picture when using the PowerXND 2000 filter at the maximum setting. If there is no built in eyepiece shutter in your camera, use whatever available to block the viewfinder eyepiece when taking a picture, or switch to liveview mode.</p>
<div><p></p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do the scale indicators (round dots) on the filter mean? Are they directly related to the light reduction stop? </p>
<p>No, the scale indicators on the filter are indication of variable ND light reduction direction and they do not correlated to ND value. When setting the filter to the Min setting, it’s at ND 16 or four stops. When setting to the Max setting, it’s at ND 2000 or 11 stops.</p>
<div><p></p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Will you make the scale indicators directly related to each stop? </p>
<p>Currently there is no plan to have scale indicators calibrated to each ND stop. There is a technical difficulty in doing so since the f-stop is not linear light transmittance. If we were to make the scale indicators related to each ND stop, there would be very crowded indicators near the MAX end of the scale. We will try to find a better solution in the future.</p>
<div><p></p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the PowerXND 2000 color tint free?</p>
<p>Within most of the working range the filter is color tint free. When the filter is set to nearing the maximum ND, there may be a slight magenta tint that can be easily corrected in post processing such as adjusting white balance.</p>
<div><p></p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Does the PowerXND 2000 filter have cross X patterns common in variable ND filters? </p>
<p>There is a MAX indicator on the PowerXND 2000 filter. When using the filter inside the MAX range, there is no cross X pattern. However, when turning the filter passed the MAX setting, heavy blue cast and distortion could happen which is outside of the filter specification already. We do not recommend using the PowerXND 2000 filter over the MAX setting.</p>
<p>It’s worth to mention that variable ND filters in the market today all exhibit this cross X patterns when being set to over seven stops, our PowerXND 2000 filter is very clean and safe to use at seven stops due to the four stops extra headroom.</p>
<div><p></p></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you use a physical limiter to prevent users rotating the filter passed the MAX setting?  </p>
<p>We could put a physical limiter in the filter so users will not able to see the cross X patterns. However, by doing so the filter frame would become much bulky and won’t maintain the slim frame structure which is important to prevent vignetting. We choose to allow users to select what is acceptable range to themselves and to use the slim frame as a higher priority.</p>

With the best light reduction and resolution capabilities, PowerXND 2000 filters can be used in a wide variety photography as well as video applications. It’s one filter that can replace multiple fixed ND filters.

The PowerXND 2000 has 11 stops (ND 2000) of light reduction capability which has been only available with a few fixed neutral density (ND) filters until now.See the PowerXND 2000 variable ND filter in simulation:



Designed in California, the PowerXND 2000 has an innovative filter frame design which reduces the overall volume of the filter. This reduced profile is important for keeping vignetting to a minimum on wide angle lenses.
The filter frame of the PowerXND 2000 is optimized to reduce height and volume. With a filter height of 5.5mm when mounted on a lens, the PowerXND 2000 is about half the height of other variable ND filters and has a smaller overall volume.
Multiple layers of nano coating are applied to glass surfaces for anti-reflection purposes and to protect filter surface from dust, water, oil, and soil contaminations.

Neutral density filters can be used to reduce light passing through them so that A slower shutter speed can be used. 
When taking a photo of a waterfall or moving stream, a slow shutter speed can be utilized to produce a pleasing yet smooth photo.


For example, this photo is taken In a sunny afternoon in Southern California, using the PowerXND 2000 can bring down the shutter speed to 5"" instead of 1/100"".
Please visit the Gallery section for sample photos. They are taken with an early prototype of the PowerXND 2000. Some of them are post processed slightly for artistic purposes such as color saturation.

Full production once the funding will be started in April. Shipment is scheduled for May.

    




Since the launch of our Kickstarter campaign, the PowerXND 2000 has been featured on many websites and blog sites. 





We finally receive a test report from an Imatest Certified Lab. They put four ND filters through several tests: Aurora PowerXND 2000, Brand B variable ND (4 - 400), Brand H variable ND (4 - 400), and Brand H round glass based ND 1000 filter.
A summary of the test report is available at: http://aurora-aperture.com/2016/03/30/powerxnd-2000-lab-test/
As seen in the report, the Aurora PowerXND 2000 achieves highest score across all ND settings, even slightly ahead of the Brand H fixed ND 1000 filter.

Next is color check. All variable filters are tested in MIN setting. Again, the Aurora PowerXND 2000 achieves highest color accuracy result.

FAQ


What does ND 16 or ND 200 mean? 
There are two ND notation systems, one with an integer number such as ND 16, and another with a decimal number such as ND 1.2. The integer notation represents the amount of light transmittance decided by that number. For example, the light transmittance of ND 2 is 1/2 (50%) or one stop, whereas ND 16 is 1/16 (6.25%) or four stops. In other words, an ND 2000 filter only allows 1/2000 or 0.05% of the light being passed.
The decimal system uses 0.3 as incremental value for each stop. Thus an ND 1.2 is same as ND 16. For further information, please refer to this Wikipedia article :https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutral-density_filter

However, we do NOT provide a warranty against damage or any other defects/issues caused to your lenses WHILE using or NOT using the Universal Lens Hood. In addition, we will not replace lost or stolen Universal Lens Hoods.If your lens breaks while using our product, we are not liable for your camera gear, its repair/replacement, nor act as a financial insurance agency against potentially harmful issues to your camera gear, especially your lenses. The Universal Lens Hoods acts as an enhancing tool to prevent glare and help to avert elements from potentially contacting your lens. That is it. We strongly advise you seek out and invest in insurance for your gear just as any other professional would do in any other industry! :)Customs & DutiesUnfortunately, we cannot mark any pledge/reward as a 'gift'. It is illegal to do so. In addition, import duties and taxes are NOT INCLUDED in our reward levels. These charges vary by country and are completely out of our control. We are shipping the Universal Lens Hood all over the world and it is impossible for us to build the various customs charges into the multiple reward levels of Kickstarter.But, this online tool can help you calculate additional costs;http://www.importcalculator.comRemember, we are the creators of KUVRD and the Universal Lens Hood, not international customs. You can use this tool as estimates when determining additional costs in receiving our products.Risks and ChallengesOur biggest foreseeable challenge will be properly calculating, negotiating, and fixating costs and pricing with manufacturers for materials. Silicone is a rather volatile material, where, based on municipal laws, seasons and other related material-based industries, much of the cost of material used in the Universal Lens Hood can almost double overnight thanks to some shift or change in one of those aforementioned factors.Luckily, we've already made a Purchase Order for 20,000 units of the Universal Lens Hood! Hopefully if we need to make another PO for this Campaign, based on the demand and current pricing of silicone, we'll be able to fixate or even decrease the unit cost! Our second biggest challenge is determining a realistic 'estimated date of delivery'. Based on our history with our current chosen manufacturers, we can have a unit created and in our hands within 45 days. Taking into account holidays, quantity of units, priority of our order with the manufacturer and shipping to customers worldwide, we gave ourselves a buffer of an additional 60 days to handle any 'hiccups' throughout the process.There are always unforeseeable risks, setbacks and hiccups which is why we plan to be transparent and do everything we can to keep our customers (you, the backer) happy.",30.0,1,"5 Campaigns

<p>In 2016, my 10-year-old daughter and I created a YouTube channel we called <a href=""http://youtube.com/c/osmotips"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Osmo Tips</a>. We had just purchased the DJI Osmo, a handheld, 3 axis, gimbal-stabilized camera that shoots smooth video.</p>
<p>Our goal was to share as many tips and tricks on using the Osmo. </p>
<p>In a relatively short time, we attracted the attention of thousands of photo and video enthusiasts from around the globe.  To keep our YouTube audience inspired, we went all out to review as many camera gear or accessories that would work with the Osmo. This was our first insight into the opportunity that would become the goosepod.</p>
<p>To keep up with the intense nature of our video creating process, we constantly searched for quick and efficient ways to make the most of the gear needed to shoot our videos. </p>
<p><a href=""http://youtube.com/c/osmotips"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490569077/raihlzwoel7bio7yuj52.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>All our shoots involve mounting and setting up the multi-cameras, lights, microphones, audio recorders as well as the gear we're actually reviewing.  This often took ages… sometimes more time than the actual shoot itself, and usually spreading over a few days.</p>
<p>Releasing a video every week, meant it was only a few days before we started the whole process all over again and again and again...</p>
<p><i><strong> Something had to change…</strong></i></p>
<p>We took a really long hard look at the products available on the market today but felt that they all fell short in one way or another…We knew we wanted the most flexible, yet robust system to mount our gear easily and reliably. We wanted a material that would bend easily, maintain it’s shape, and sustain the weights of most camera gear.<strong>(500g – 1kg)</strong>.  </p>
<p>Armed with this requirement, we got in touch with a local tube manufacturer and after several weeks of tweaking our design and specifications, we started working through several prototypes to a point where we are ready to launch the real thing .</p>

<p>The goosepod’s flexibility comes directly from its construction.

<p> </p></div>","Who's Dan?
As a professional photographer, I have been fortunate enough to capture images of people thriving in various landscapes around the globe.  Whether it's a rock climber pulling down on overhanging stone, a yogi experiencing a glimpse of enlightenment or a Nepali farmer having tea along a Himalayan trail - I love to witness and document people living their passions.  
 
What's Dan Doing?
It gives me great pleasure to announce that I will be spending time in Ecuador this May volunteering my photography services and equipment to work with the non-profit organization: CRACYP (which stands for Rural Forestation and Progress Network Corporation, en Espanol).  They are in need for someone to produce powerful imagery and tell their story of environmental sustainability projects they have launched in Ecuador.
 
Who Is The CRACYP?
This NGO exists solely to facilitate reforestation and rural development in an agricultural area of extreme poverty. Their mission of ""Progreso Verde"" or ""Green Progress"" is all about social and economic development. But they do this in a way which protects the environment.  They build environmental awareness and motivate and assist local communities to take practical conservation action.  CRACYP's many sustainable development projects help to increase incomes to the point where people are able to think further ahead than the next meal and can afford to care about the environment. 
 
The Bottom Line
As you all know, travel expenses are not so cheap these days. Airfare, local transportation, travel insurance, food and accommodations all add up pretty quickly. (This is the part where I ask for your help). In order to follow through with this project without having to move my wife and dog out of our house and into our Subaru, I'm going to need to raise some funds. $3000 worth of funds to be exact.  
The ultimate goal of the project will be to provide CRACYP with powerful imagery that will be used to share the organization's mission via their website, marketing material and through editorial pieces. I will also assemble a collection of images from this project for gallery exhibits around Seattle. A percentage of the proceeds from all images sold will go directly to CRACYP.
100% of the proceeds go towards the funding of this project. 
If I surpass the goal of $3000, the extra funds will continue to go straight into the project for offsetting costs such as gallery exhibits, production costs and extended time in Ecuador to produce even more images
I thank you all for your consideration. If you have any questions at all, please email me at dan@danholzphotography.com. I would love to hear from you.
If you can't donate right now, no worries.  You can still help by sharing this cause with anyone who may be interested.  Pass it on!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

After picking up my first camera, I fell in love with photography, and my passion for it has continued to grow ever since. As I learned more, I found that this could be a way to serve people. Photography has allowed me to bless others with the skills I have been gifted with. The Opportunities I've had to photograph, promote, and document  people has allowed me to build up those around me. By showcasing peoples talents, businesses, and goods, my heart has grown to use my skill to serve others.</p><p>In order for me to continue in the direction of photography, I am in need of some improvements to my gear. Unfortunately, the camera I have now is failing  me, and has become insufficient for the quality of work I'd like to do.  This campaign is designed to help me obtain the tools that I need in order to continue to do what I love, grow my skill, and serve others. My camera has become faulty, and is no longer able to perform the necessary tasks to take high caliber photos. This has kept me from doing what I love, and providing others with quality pictures. I feel that I am called to this field, and truly do have a passion and heart for photography. Although, in order for me to do my work with excellence, I need sufficient camera gear. </p><p>In order for me to continue doing all of this, I need your help. By your support, you are not only helping me attain the tools I need, but you are enabling me to further my passion, and ultimately your support will go to furthering others benefit.</p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here are the details.</p><p>If you are willing to come alongside me, your generous contribution will allow me to fill the need I have for a new camera body.</p><p>Fortunately, I have had various artists and businesses that have stood by me and partnered with me. So when you give your financial support, I can give an adequate gift back to you, the supporter. So when you give, you are able to receive different offerings.<br/><br/> In order for me to reach this tangible goal, I need you, the supporter. But I don't want it to just end there. Here are some of the ways I can give back to you. </p><p>Some of these amazing perks are:</p><p>1. An 8x10 print of the famous portland, OR sign that I have photographed. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p>2. An 8x10 selected print of various musical artists, autographed and personalized to you! They have graciously stood by me and are willing to support this cause! There will be a few shots of Andy Mineo, Propaganda, and Eshon Burgundy to choose from. </p><p>3. My good friends over at Portsmith Co. have supported me and donated their famous CNCH wallets to give those of you who have donated. </p><p>4. I am also giving away 2 hour photo sessions. Whether you are a senior, family, model, athlete, musician, or what have you, I am more than willing to photograph you for a few hours and photograph what YOU would like to capture. This will include two 8x10 prints of your choice, as well as the edited high resolution images we took from the shoot.</p><p>If for some reason, we do not make it to our goal, do not worry! These funds will be put into the piggy bank and will be added to the camera fund. This will play a crucial part in getting one step closer to this goal!</p><ul></ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>In order to continue to serve people with my gifts, I need your support. Since I have blessed others with my own gifts, I am in need of reinvestment from you to help me to continue to do so. </p><ul></ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If for some reason you are unable to support financially, don't worry. You can help in other ways. </p><p>PRAY: First of all, pray that this campaign would bring glory to God and that it would help bless people.</p><p>SHARE: Share this campaign using the Indiegogo share tools. Spread the word and tell your friends and family. Share it on all of your social media sites!

As I learned more, I found that this could be a way to serve people. Photography has allowed me to bless others with the skills I have been gifted with. The Opportunities I've had to photograph, promote, and document  people has allowed me to build up those around me. By showcasing peoples talents, businesses, and goods, my heart has grown to use my skill to serve others.In order for me to continue in the direction of photography, I am in need of some improvements to my gear. Unfortunately, the camera I have now is failing  me, and has become insufficient for the quality of work I'd like to do.  This campaign is designed to help me obtain the tools that I need in order to continue to do what I love, grow my skill, and serve others. My camera has become faulty, and is no longer able to perform the necessary tasks to take high caliber photos. This has kept me from doing what I love, and providing others with quality pictures. I feel that I am called to this field, and truly do have a passion and heart for photography. Although, in order for me to do my work with excellence, I need sufficient camera gear. In order for me to continue doing all of this, I need your help. By your support, you are not only helping me attain the tools I need, but you are enabling me to further my passion, and ultimately your support will go to furthering others benefit.   What We Need & What You Get Here are the details.If you are willing to come alongside me, your generous contribution will allow me to fill the need I have for a new camera body.Fortunately, I have had various artists and businesses that have stood by me and partnered with me. So when you give your financial support, I can give an adequate gift back to you, the supporter. So when you give, you are able to receive different offerings. In order for me to reach this tangible goal, I need you, the supporter. But I don't want it to just end there. Here are some of the ways I can give back to you. Some of these amazing perks are:1. An 8x10 print of the famous portland, OR sign that I have photographed. 2. An 8x10 selected print of various musical artists, autographed and personalized to you! They have graciously stood by me and are willing to support this cause! There will be a few shots of Andy Mineo, Propaganda, and Eshon Burgundy to choose from. 3. My good friends over at Portsmith Co. have supported me and donated their famous CNCH wallets to give those of you who have donated. 4. I am also giving away 2 hour photo sessions. Whether you are a senior, family, model, athlete, musician, or what have you, I am more than willing to photograph you for a few hours and photograph what YOU would like to capture. This will include two 8x10 prints of your choice, as well as the edited high resolution images we took from the shoot.If for some reason, we do not make it to our goal, do not worry! These funds will be put into the piggy bank and will be added to the camera fund. This will play a crucial part in getting one step closer to this goal!  The ImpactIn order to continue to serve people with my gifts, I need your support. Since I have blessed others with my own gifts, I am in need of reinvestment from you to help me to continue to do so.   Other Ways You Can HelpIf for some reason you are unable to support financially, don't worry. You can help in other ways. PRAY: First of all, pray that this campaign would bring glory to God and that it would help bless people.SHARE: Share this campaign using the Indiegogo share tools. Spread the word and tell your friends and family. Share it on all of your social media sites! And go follow and like my Instagram!Your support and belief in me plays a HUGE role and I am thankful for each and everyone of you!Thank you!Justin Bond",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Forrest Mankins. I'm 24, a professional musician, a photographer, and artist from Tulsa, Oklahoma.  I spend a good deal of time traveling and pursuing my dreams. </p>
<ul>
<li>Last week my Canon DSLR and lens were stolen from me, and I am seeking to replace them.  It's very difficult to find steady work when potential employers know you must leave to tour, write, and record at different times, and there is no other way that I will be able to replace these anytime soon.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>I've never thought about my camera as a possesion.  It was a tool that allowed me to produce the things I constantly feel pulled to create.  I used it to share how I see the world; nature, people, places, in single moments.  I've only just begun my path with art, and I'm asking for your support.  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What exactly am I asking for, and where is it going?</h3>
<p>I'm asking for $1485.  Why $1485?  The cheapest that I can get what I need is $980.  That's a refurbished camera, one discount lens, and a memory card.  Not an upgrade, but a replacement.  So again, why on earth would I be asking for $1485?!  The prints I am offering are on high quality photo paper, and as a result cost me a bit more - especially as individual orders. I also have to securely ship these so they arrive at your door in perfect condition. So there it is, $980 goes straight to the camera, $504 is all for production, shipping, and this website's marginal percentage.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>For your contributions, I'm offering photoshoots, lessons, a lens, and of course prints!  Near the top of this page is a tab that says ""Gallery.""  Click on it to view photos and pick your favorite(s), and then click the ""Campaign Home"" tab to come back to this page and make your contribution!  Click each photo for a larger view, and to see sizing availability.  Leave the name(s) of the photos and sizes you want in the Comment Box when ordering!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Regardless of how much we raise, after production costs, all of it is going straight to a camera.  I don't really have an off switch when it comes to creating.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>One last thing </h3>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>If you have any questions about any of this, ask me!  I'd be more than happy to talk to you, here's my email!  <a href=""mailto:forrestmankins@icloud.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">forrestmankins@icloud.com</a>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If you can't contribute financially, it's still a huge help if you share this with the people in your life, whether by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, email, etcetera -- the top of the page has a Share tool that's really easy to use  Everything truly helps and is greatly and humbly appreciated. </li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much for your support, it means the world.  </p>

Last week my Canon DSLR and lens were stolen from me, and I am seeking to replace them.  It's very difficult to find steady work when potential employers know you must leave to tour, write, and record at different times, and there is no other way that I will be able to replace these anytime soon.


I've never thought about my camera as a possesion.  It was a tool that allowed me to produce the things I constantly feel pulled to create.  I used it to share how I see the world; nature, people, places, in single moments.  I've only just begun my path with art, and I'm asking for your support.  



What exactly am I asking for, and where is it going?
I'm asking for $1485.  Why $1485?  The cheapest that I can get what I need is $980.  That's a refurbished camera, one discount lens, and a memory card.  Not an upgrade, but a replacement.  So again, why on earth would I be asking for $1485?!  The prints I am offering are on high quality photo paper, and as a result cost me a bit more - especially as individual orders. I also have to securely ship these so they arrive at your door in perfect condition. So there it is, $980 goes straight to the camera, $504 is all for production, shipping, and this website's marginal percentage.
 

For your contributions, I'm offering photoshoots, lessons, a lens, and of course prints!  Near the top of this page is a tab that says ""Gallery.""  Click on it to view photos and pick your favorite(s), and then click the ""Campaign Home"" tab to come back to this page and make your contribution!  Click each photo for a larger view, and to see sizing availability.  Leave the name(s) of the photos and sizes you want in the Comment Box when ordering!


Regardless of how much we raise, after production costs, all of it is going straight to a camera.  I don't really have an off switch when it comes to creating.  

 


One last thing 



If you have any questions about any of this, ask me!  I'd be more than happy to talk to you, here's my email!  forrestmankins@icloud.com



If you can't contribute financially, it's still a huge help if you share this with the people in your life, whether by Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, email, etcetera -- the top of the page has a Share tool that's really easy to use  Everything truly helps and is greatly and humbly appreciated. 

Thank you so much for your support, it means the world.

We are the boud team, the developers of PIC. First and foremost, we would like to thank you all for supporting our previous PIC campaign. Your patience throughout the campaign was greatly appreciated. Thanks to your generous support, we were finally able to make PIC a reality. We are now back on Indiegogo inDemand ready to offer our upgraded model of PIC! Your continued support would be greatly appreciated!   PIC was born from the idea that cameras were meant for play! Existing action cams are often unwieldy or complicated to use. Smartphone cameras are limited by their narrow lens, while also being hard to position for a good shot. With its free-form flexible design, PIC's unique moldable body lets you decide how to play with PIC and enjoy the gorgeous image and video results. With the advancement of portable camera technology, the potential for the creation of interesting content has undergone a rapid evolution. With PIC, you can shoot engaging share-worthy time lapse and animated GIF videos and share it instantly through to your social media channels like Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat. Adorable and eye-catching, PIC is clearly no ordinary camera. With customizable character designs and a wide range of colors, PIC is the most fun you’ll ever hava with a camera.       Featured as a winner of the CES 2016 Innovation Honoree Award!PIC has been spotlighted by major media outlets and consumers around the world!   Do you believe that a camera this small can offer excellent quality? Believe it! PIC’s 135° wide-angle camera lens is the smallest of its kind. Shoot in 1080p Full HD resolution to capture any moment in stunning detail. The equipped 8 MP image sensors offer crisp resolution, light sensitivity, and intuitive auto focus functionality. Did your PIC get caught out in the rain? No waterproof case? No problem. PIC is highly splash resistant and can withstand day-to-day water exposure. You can even wash PIC in running water. However, as PIC is SPLASH PROOF please don’t submerge PIC in water for prolonged periods of time. PIC’s time lapse feature lets you fast forward your life. With its poseable design, PIC will hold its position for hours allowing you to capture breathtaking time lapse content. See the buzz of busy city life or watch a flower bloom with PIC! Create endlessly entertaining animated GIFs that play a short clip on loop. Create your own meme, thumbnail Facebook profile pic, or eye catching Instagram/SnapChat content. Life is just more fun with animated GIFs. Choose the PIC that matches your style. Choose between a line-up of colors and customize PIC using unique head caps. Frank and his Friends are stoked to meet you! Unique holiday themed caps are currently in development! Connect PIC to your smartphone via WiFi direct or BLE 4.0 to view a real-time preview of your footage. Control PIC from your smartphone remotely and transfer video and image content from PIC to your phone. You can also upload your content to social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat.  
PIC is controlled through its simple one-button control. PIC is as easy to use as a selfie-stick but comes equipped with multifunction capabilities!   PIC’s 16GB memory can store two hours worth of Full HD (1080p/30f) videos. Equipped with a 630MA battery, PIC can shoot continuously for 70 minutes. Film your next party, concert or travel destination. PIC will automatically organize your content into 4GB files. Software updates including firmware upgrades for PIC will be provided through over-the-air OTA transmission. No physical cable connection is required. PIC will continuously be upgraded as development continues, even after your unbox it.      
PIC’s companion application is available for both iOS and Android. The PIC App provides a number of functions including live-preview, slow-motion, time lapse, GIFs and a gallery of your content. Unlock the full power of PIC with the PIC App.

<p>I've been into photography for a few years now, but it was only last year that I could afford a proper DSLR camera. Since then I've mostly made do with the lens that came with the camera, and only recently bought a cheapo secondary lens.<br/>I'm starting to feel a bit limited by these two lenses already and am looking to add another one to my collection, something which would expand my options quite a bit and allow me to take different kinds of photos than I have been able to up to this point. Lenses can be kind of expensive though and I wasn't sure how I'd acquire the funds I needed. That's when it occurred to me: Indiegogo! I'll set up a campaign here and offer  some nice perks in exchange for contributions, like personal handwritten postcards, desktop wallpaper and prints of my photos.</p>
<p><strong>So check out the video above, those are the photos I'm selling.</strong></p>
<h2>What will a new lens do for me?</h2>
<p>A new, high quality lens will provide me with options. Options to take different kinds of photos than my current gear will allow.</p>
<h2>Why should you contribute?</h2>
<p>For the sheer joy of knowing you've made a difference to my hobby, and a nice customized, handwritten thank-you postcard to commemorate that fact.<br/>But let's say that does nothing for you. Well, if you like any of my photos (see the video if you haven't already) you can get prints. Perfect for framing and hanging up in the living room, or perhaps to give as a gift. Or maybe you like the sound of the pack of desktop backgrounds to liven up your computer's desktop?</p>
<h2>What happens if I don't meet the goal?</h2>
<p>The money, minus the cost of perks, goes into a closed bank account until I've saved up enough for a new lens. You're contributing to get me a new lens, and my word to you is that that's exactly what your contribution will be going to.</p>
<h2>What happens if I exceed the goal?</h2>
<p>Well, that depends on by what amount I exceed the goal. First of all more money means a better lens. Beyond that I might be able buy some filters for the lens, maybe a camera bag, a decent tripod or some other photographic equipment (feel free to make suggestions in the comments).</p>
<p>---</p>
<h2><strong>If you contribute $10 or more make sure to tell me in the comment box how I should customize your perk: the resolution of the desktop wallpapers, and for $20 and up which photo(s) you want out of the ones in the video.<br/></strong></h2></div>","What's this about?

This material is strong, tough and more expensive than many other plastic materials. It is often used on product which requires the high intensity build, such as the GoPro housing.Why not make it motorized?Motorized panoramic head often have severe problems with stitching when there is moving people and moving car. With the manual rig like Pano5+1, however, you can easily avoid the moving objects.Can Pano5+1 MarkII fit Xiaomi Yi camera?No.Can Pano5+1 MarkII fit my SJ action camera?Not tested by now. However, if any action camera can fit into the waterproof housing of GoPro Hero4/3+, and its view angle is equal to GoPro or even wider, we think it maybe works.  Follow us and discover us

Each time I answered sure, no problem, that's easy, you've probably done the same. But then, if you are like me, you quickly realize that for anything other than sharing by posting to Facebook or Instagram it gets complicated. Especially when it comes to more than one photo or video. Sure you can upload everything to Dropbox and send out a link or try the email attachment route, but then your recipients have to download everything and organize it themselves. That’s a hassle that takes too much time! Not to mention, for those who are not technically nimble, these methods may alienate them from ever getting to view those captured precious memories. </p><p>When it comes to events and memories that matter, people care, they tend to spend time selecting the best photos, enhancing them and organizing them into albums. What’s more, the people whom these photos are shared with then have to spend time extracting, downloading, and organizing them as well -- double the work with half the fun.</p><p>On a daily basis, this scenario repeats itself millions of times all over the world. Some call it ""photo hell"". Organizing photos into albums, enhancing them, commenting on them is something we want to do. We want to then see those efforts from all of our devices, and we want to share them with our family and friends. For the technically minded this can be done but it's not easy, for everyone else, it is nearly impossible. This is why thousands of photos of family, children and other memories are trapped in peoples phones, camera SD cards and digital photo libraries.</p><p>So we thought -- there has to be a better way. A way that gives users structured memory sharing across multiple groups (we call them Tribes); easy cross-device sharing where the devices can be either Android or iOS, Mac or Windows, and ideally be as simple as taking a photo or video. As a bonus, wouldn’t it be great if we could also take back some of our privacy, and only share these photos and videos with the people we want to share them with?</p>Well, we’ve built it and we call it pixelFlik.<div>

<p><span>PixelFlik is an App that runs on both Android and iOS. With pixelFlik you designate Tribes (groups of users) that represent your family, friends, other parents of your kid’s soccer team, your tennis buddies, your mommy club, etc. </span></p>
<p>Once you define your Tribe, you are done with the sharing bit. From that point on, if a Tribe is selected, any photo or video you take is automatically distributed to the members of that Tribe, to all of their devices. The photos aren’t altered or compressed and remain in their original resolution, and are distributed without doing anything other than taking the photo. The same applies to videos.</p>
<p>That is the beauty of pixelFlik -- <b>ONE CLICK SHARING</b> -- where the click is the act of taking the photo or shooting the video.  There are of course the customary safety measures, like, make my Tribe the default always. That way any photo you take is only shared to your devices. You have to copy it to another tribe to share it there.</p>
<p>In our early tests and trials, once people have tried it, they universally love it. Photo organizing and sharing the way it should be, no muss no fuss. It just works! In fact it works so well that our early adopters have estimated that it saves them up to two hours a week. If you think about the time you spend sharing photos and videos, who gets what, or saving what has been shared with you, then you know what we mean.</p>
<p>PixelFlik is for families first, that’s why we also created pixelFlik.tv. PixelFlik.tv is an optional TV set-top-box that connects to the pixelFlik cloud. It’s just like having a giant cell phone at home. Any photos and videos you take get delivered to the unit and can be viewed on your high definition TV. It is great for distant family members that are not so technically savvy (think grandma), and is really cool to have on display at parties. </p>
<p>My children’s grandmother lives in Europe. Every Saturday evening she sits down and gets videos and photos of her grandchildren in real-time just after they wake up. It’s so cool! My son has learned to take photos and get Grandma to to turn on the TV so that she can see them right after he takes them. The bonding is amazing.</p>
<p>I really hope that you like the premise of pixelFlik. We’ve created some early adopter perks for you to take advantage of; that, frankly, will help us make pixelFlik even more awesome.</p>
<p>We’ve created pixelFlik for you, us, your family and ours. But guess what, it’s great for business too. Our professional photographer friends are itching to use it to distribute photo libraries with their clients, our professional legal friends are already testing it with their clients. Simply put, it is so much easier than email.</p>
<p>So please, check out the perks, and as you do so, think of your Tribe and let us know how you plan to use pixelFlik.</p>

<h3>PixelFlik App Summary</h3>
<p>The pixelFlik app will eventually be available to both Android and iOS devices for purchase and download.</p>

<p>If it’s your first time as a pixelFlik user, you’ll have to register, after that you can add as many devices as you want. The Home screen is the first screenshot. We’ve organized Photos, Videos, and Files into it’s own area.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/botNEHtwfb37GLmU5sdc9TNvk7PaOqZGusL9qyqPWbt5wkBO9tmcJc5ARU7mIdh7_sT-JWT2H7Jy8raJeUeF9DS2W7mKYoRpB-co5rVwuDEXyOX6T4S-p7bsaOE3bLUN75FP3mMO"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>For the Android version, we will have a “Pro” upgrade that will allow you to turn your phone into a hotspot to share locally using wi-fi. It's great for meetings.</p>
<p>There is a “Take Photo” button to shoot photos and video within the app, but you can also shot photos and video from the phone camera directly. Which you can setup to auto import into pixelFlik -- so cool.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you touch the “Tribes” button you get the tribe management page.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/LLXcDoZIkooDbwNU68DcYU0yGS69t5NrTnxBfIS5wvLnIWZCi8R0CBzLbfC0xFtUseFD4cV1ZEDphB2hqNVK9soh2YC39XteXVO3Sr_udCAthnxHzjD35wKezGowITbaVu71T9p9"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Here you can manage your tribes, create them, join them, leave them, and select the current default.</p>
<p>We have worked hard to create an interface that lets you manage your photos or videos by creating structured folders. The organizational structure is shared with others in your Tribe. So you do it, they get it. Simple.<br/></p>

<br/><h3>pixelFlik.tv Summary</h3>
<p>PixelFlik.tv is optional. You do not need this to use pixelFlik, but it is sure handy for distant family and for sharing events and memories together by the TV. To do this we created a set-top box unit that works with pixelFlik.</p>
<p><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/XeHFhWsW51PnAbD-c0a8_3hZwFabT01VTVMMxPBlL3KP6jyEvHDGCjDwFbKkvRkHAXpw1AYH79sXQ4P8cOyEpar4-_HVknHUUqPrB_-kKpMTFBHBxndC_FDZ_kgIXnoAYgNkhbh9"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<br/><p> The pixelFlik.tv device provides the following unique features:</p>
<ul><li><p>Android-based device. As mentioned earlier, it’s just like having a giant cellphone at home. PixelFlik.tv uses a customized pixelFlik app, so the screenshots and functions that you learn on the phone are the same on the tv.box -- except that you use the remote not a touch screen.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>Always connected to your TV. Hopefully you (or your parents or in-laws, friends, etc.) have a high definition TV to view all the beautiful, high resolution photos and videos everyone is producing.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>Very easy to operate. It’s just like operating a TV, not a PC or even like a smartphone.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>Has a wi-fi router function. Your local devices can connect to pixelFlik.tv via wi-fi.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p><span>It has storage! A lot. Standard model has 16GB (giga byte) of storage. Deluxe model has 2TB (tera byte) of storage. Both models have a SD slot for additional storage. 16GB can storage approximately 50K photos or 65 minutes of high resolution video. 2TB is more than 125 times more storage than the Standard model.</span></p></li></ul>
<p>The pixelFlik app is the only tool you need for easy sharing. So when is pixelFlik.tv useful? We believe it’s great for at least three situations:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Non-technical people who want to receive and view photos &amp; videos. Great example are grandparents. Their adult children can use pixelFlik app to shoot photos and videos of the grandkids. The photos just show up on the grandparent’s pixelFlik.tv. So simple.</p></li>
<li><p>Events and gatherings where there are lots of photos &amp; videos being shot and displayed. Examples include weddings, tradeshows, conferences, concerts, night clubs.</p></li>
<li><p>Home storage. For you tech comfortable folks, PixelFlik.tv is available with 2TB of storage. Standard model has 16GB with available SD slot for significantly more storage. Offload your smartphones photos and videos. Use pixelFlik.tv like a network attached storage.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3>How pixelFlik Works</h3>
<p>PixelFlik is obviously software deployed as an app built for Android and for iOS.</p>
<p>The pixelFlik services are controlled and facilitated by the pixelFlik cloud. Of course, the internet is the backbone for transporting all the data between pixelFlik apps through the pixelFlik cloud.</p>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_lRlDU14sEdc9iVMbEqnTOp2wT7AIcPpuj5lhzA29xZfJNfHRKePOCUTRwWtViOWiVV1YbLYRveOLJITmXC0kcaD3cfY5RTv2aC9_Abdt6BeZ69cPyh20s1voOL15SFHtqPjSipz"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Each registered pixelFlik user has their own account. The account can include multiple Android and iOS devices. For example, I have a Mac laptop, an iPhone, an iPad, and pixelFlik.tv (an Android device). I choose for all my devices to have a pixelFlik app (the pixelFlik.tv has an Android app built-in). When I shoot a photo or receive one as a Tribe member, all my devices receive a copy of the photo.</p>
<p>A Tribe is a collection of accounts that you have been invited to join. Anyone can start a Tribe and they can give the Tribe any name. You can invite other pixelFlik users to your Tribes. There are of course control options available for a Tribe. For example, the Tribe creator may want the items shared to be Read-only.</p>
<p>Within each Tribe, you can organize the content. For example, I can create folders and sub-folders for photos and videos I shoot. I can organize the photos and video by each day of my vacation or I can create folders for each city in France I visited. The structures are replicated in each Tribe member’s devices. No more time wasted re-organizing photos that you receive.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need your help so we can ship the product. We’ll use the funds to polish the Android version and to finish the iOS app.</p>
<p>We're targeting $300,000:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>$200,000 for software developers. We’ve already made a lot of progress, but there is still a little more that needs to be done! The remaining software development efforts will be focused on completing some software features and polishing the products.</p></li>
<li><p>$100,000 design and purchase of the pixelFlik.tv boxes. Some integration effort with the box’s electronics. We will have delivery of the 16GB version within a few months of this campaign’s conclusion. The funding will help us complete and deliver the 2TB model well before Christmas 2017.</p></li>

I'm a 20 year old from Chicago, IL who has been photographing bands and artists for a little over two years now. This year I launched my magazine, Highlight Magazine and it's been incredibly sucessful. I work very hard in the industry and I'm very goal driven. I'm currently interning, running a magazine and shooting all that I can. I was a marketing student at Columbia in Chicago but my financial situation has forced me to take time off.</p>

<p>Today I went to the apple store because my trackpad on my 15in MacBook Pro was not working. It was being weird and it basically looked like somebody had hacked my computer and was moving it around and I was also unable to left click. Each time I clicked it was as if I was right clicking and it was odd. When I was at the store, they told me it was common for this type of thing to happen, and they were going to replace it and have it ready for me in about an hour. So I left the store and wandered around for a while. About an hour later, I was waiting outside of the store again, a man from the store called and told me that there were some problems. He asked me to come in and sat me down and explained that some type of liquid (I still have no idea what the hell it was) was inside and was currently eating away at the motherboard. The only thing I can think of that happened was in the fall of 2010 when I spilled coffee in my backpack coming back to my dorm from class. Other than that, I have no idea.</p>
<p>He told me that they could fix it but they would have to completely replace the motherboard, send it in to be fixed and that it would cost me $1350 to get it fixed. My applecare won’t cover this because it was an ‘external source’ that caused the problem. I also explained to him that I am a photographer and I’m scared of losing all of my photos. He told me to not even work on the computer because he thinks it could die any minute on me with no warning. As I’m typing now, my cursor is moving around and twitching.</p>
<p>I immediately started balling my eyes out in the store because the past few months of my life have been a mess. I just quit my job and started at Starbucks literally a few days ago. I barely know at this point how I am going to pay my rent for August. I don’t even have money to buy a hard drive to save my photos, but luckily I’m blessed with amazing friends and one of them (Brian Carpenter) just offered to buy me a hard drive so I can at least back up my work. I’ve also been able to back up my most important work on my roommates hard drive and I’m thankful for that as well.</p>
<p>My plan right now is to apply for a best buy credit card and make $100 payments a month on a new laptop. My parents can’t help me or anything so it’s basically all on me.</p>
<p>I hate being that person on the internet, but I seriously can’t function without a computer. Being a photographer, I need a place to edit and work on my photos. If I can’t do this, there will be no Highlight and no more Ashley Osborn photography. I had a 15inch MacBook pro. But Best Buy currently is selling a 13inch MB Pro and a two year full insurance plan for about $1800 so that's all I need. I can downgrade - I'm completely fine with that. I just need something.</p>
<p>EDIT: A refurbished 13 inch Macbook pro for $900.</p>
<p>It would mean the world to me if you could help me at all. Thank you so much.<br/><br/></p>

<p>It was four years ago to the day Blind Spot Gear launched the Kickstarter for the original scorpion light. Frustrated by the expensive and unintuitive professional-quality lighting rigs the market offered we set off to take the lighting industry by storm.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In aiming to bring accessible professional lighting within the budget of your average film maker Blind Spot Gear brought a unique company ethos to an industry where affordable lighting was largely dominated by a few big players and mass produced low quality options.  </p>
<p>The Scorpion Light did not disappoint, proving dependable in the world's most extreme locations. Its rugged portability, dependability, and flexible nature has made it the light of choice for professional photographers and filmmakers working with productions across the world in the most demanding environments.</p>
<p>Since introducing the Scorpion to the market we have been working and learning from our customers and we've drawn on this experience and knowledge to redesign the Scorpion Light for the mobile professional. </p>

<p><strong>Why did we make them?</strong></p>
<p>There were a million lights, and none of them met our needs. They were bulky, expensive, flimsy, unintuitive and frustrating. We knew we could do better and so we decided to make a light that met the needs of the many at an affordable price.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What makes the Scorpion stand out?  </strong></p>
<p>Flexibility, portability, and speed. Made from beautiful machine anodised aluminium the Scorpion is the full package, well organised and easily transportable, it provides a lighting set up that can be rigged nearly anywhere in a matter of seconds. When this is combined with an innovative gooseneck design and versatile barndoors it makes the perfect light when time and space are tight. Once experienced in action it's a set up you'll find hard to do without.</p>

<p><strong>Why are we updating them now?</strong></p>
<p>You (our Kickstarter backers) brought Blind Spot Gear and the Scorpion to life four years ago. As incredible a product as the original was, we have learned a lot since. From experience gained and feedback received we knew we could make this core product even better.  </p>
<p><strong>What are you getting?   </strong></p>
<p>A brand new lens design and LED makes the new Scorpion Light <strong>30% brighter</strong>, 2400 lux at a meter, while also proving an increased colour quality which, with a <strong>TLCI score of 94</strong>, it easily competes with industry leading lights. Ultimate flexibility, we've made huge improvements to the Scorpion's Gooseneck. Made from an improved brass/steel materials the neck is now thicker and 20% shorter providing more stability. We are keeping the 16mm spigot and 1/4 20 thread to give you a lighting set up that can be easily attached to almost anything. <strong>Increased portability</strong>, we know how frustrating and time-consuming transporting and setting up lighting rigs can be. With years of experience under our belts we have refined the organisation of both the Duo and Quad cases to provide a more intelligent, compact package. </p>
<p>We've been amazed at the quality of productions the product has been used on. We can't wait for you to be one of them.</p>

<p>Blind Spot Gear was launched in 2014 comprising of a close-knit team of creatives based in Glasgow, Scotland. The lighting industry has long been dominated by a handful of companies and a raft of cheap, low quality lighting, making the landscape difficult for smaller professional brands like Blind Spot Gear to thrive in. It is a fiercely competitive market, both online and offline. Whilst the story of Blind Spot Gear so far has been a success; the reality is that we still face the daily challenge of being up against the giants.</p>
<p>Launching a pre-order campaign on Kickstarter allows us to bring the Scorpion V2 to life.</p>
<p>We’re passionate about the product experience we’ve got to offer and we can’t wait to share it with you all. With your support, we can make our new product a reality.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Thank You</strong></p>
<p>Blind Spot Gear is comprised of 6 team members that have worked incredibly hard to bring this Kickstarter campaign to life. We really do hope that you like it and whether you’re a new backer of Blind Spot Gear or have been with us since the beginning, we’re hugely grateful for your support.</p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>With 3 previous successful Kickstarter campaigns under our belt and a number of products already on the market, Blind Spot Gear have a good handle on the various hurdles faced when launching a new product.

With this project however, the core product is ready to go and all the development on the accessories is complete and ready for production.</p>

We even include a tripod so you can be in the video too!Capture memorable moments more easily and professionally from your smartphone.Ever try and create videos outside?  Sound quality may not be so great, is it? How about when there is wind blowing or it is overcast or dark out? Or how about making a video inside your car, or in you house... the lighting is horrible!With just a stabilizer, you capture this amazing footage, like of your roommate jumping off the 2nd story balcony into the pool! You can’t wait to post onto Facebook. But when you download the video the wind was blowing and you couldn’t hear your roommate yell “Oh, sh**!” when he jumped.  Creating great video requires four things: 1.) Good video (your Smart Phone) 2. Steady not shaky video (stabilizer) 3. Good sound (high quality microphone) 4.) Good lighting. SmoothVu gives you all of that and moreSmooth Slo-Mo!SmoothVu will help you create clean, crisp, clear videos. We have created the world’s first fully integrated stabilizer with professional quality accessories to make the world’s first hand held production studio. Great for any profession! Real estate professionals can now make movie quality videos of their homes for sale. YouTubers can have production quality videos. TV personalities can make videos on the go! Weddings can now be filmed which you can be sure of great quality.Easy to useIs SmoothVu just for Pros? Definitely not! SmoothVu was created for everyday use. We wanted to create the best tool to capture life’s moments…..on the trail, biking, boarding, driving, etc. Our goal was to make an easy to use SmoothVu right out of the box. Power on, clip on accessories (mic, light) and go!Real 3 axis stabilization3 Axis and the cheaper 2 Axis. What is the difference? With a 2 axis stabilizer, you can see the yaw-axis jittering. It's like being in a fast car - flat but real jerky on the side to side. With 3 axis, you have true smooth video which calibrates for the x,y and z axis. Making truly stable and smooth videos. The SmoothVu has brushless motors for quiet, smooth, responsive actionActive tracking, set the App to follow a face. Set the camera by itself and it will follow that object automatically. Great for those that want to be in the video. The App will allow the camera to follow you so you can walk around in the video and the video will capture your every move.  The SmoothVu App allows you to upload your story.  Sometimes forget your lines?

<p>I'm Nathaniel Pierce, a fashion photographer that hails from Charlotte, NC and relocated to NYC only 6 months ago. I moved to this phenomenal city to gain in-state residency to complete my double major in fashion photography and cinematography hopefully at SVA. Initially I was accepted to FIT but was unable to afford the out-of-state tuition requirements leaving me with a single option - work hard, save money and move to NYC to intern, assist and work until the year requirement to gain residency is complete.</p>
<p>Since I've moved here, I have worked with numerous clients on both small and grand scales. I've done everything from headshots for actors to jewelry designer campaigns to backstage editorial photo shoots for deisngers for fashion week. It has been a wonderful journey and I'm extremely grateful for all of the opportunities I've had the pleasure of receiving in the short span of 6 months that I've lived here. I've always had high hopes and ambtions with where I'm going in life and I definitely have the right amount of drive and persistence to make this happen! <br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Heartbreak</strong></p>
<p>My camera and all of my equipment was stolen on 2/19/13 while I was shooting an event a venue in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn. Taken from me was my Nikon D200, VR 55-200mm lens, 18-55 lens, battery packs, chargers, bag, and a SB-800 flash. My camera and equipment means the world to me. It is the tool for my success and all of my creative endeavors. This camera was a gift to me from my wonderful Aunt and Uncle and the VR 55-200mm lens was a going away/good luck gift from very close family member of mine. Everything I owned has the utmost sentimental value to me - and now it's gone. Not only did I lose items that held incredible personal value, I also lost the tools of my craft that were intended to help me succeed in this intense, competitive journey I decided to embark on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Please Help Me</strong></p>
<p>While I have worked a lot since I've moved to this city, most of my work leading up to this point has been pro bono or voluntary work in order to gain connections, strengthen my resume and expand my portfolio. With that being said, I don't have the funds necessary to replace my equipment. I've finally gotten to the point where I have steady bookings for many different projects and assignments and things were definitely picking up for me leading up to this point. With my camera being stolen, I will most definitely lose clients and contacts considering the fact that I will no longer be able to work for them without my camera and equipment.</p>
<p>In order to replace my equipment in time for my clients' projects, I will have to work hard to raise approximately $1575 in the next 20 days.

<p><strong>Thank You!</strong></p>
<div>Thank you to everyone!!! I will forever remember this and forever remain in your debt.</div></div>","Hello Fellow Dreamers!
I'm Nathaniel Pierce, a fashion photographer that hails from Charlotte, NC and relocated to NYC only 6 months ago. I moved to this phenomenal city to gain in-state residency to complete my double major in fashion photography and cinematography hopefully at SVA. Initially I was accepted to FIT but was unable to afford the out-of-state tuition requirements leaving me with a single option - work hard, save money and move to NYC to intern, assist and work until the year requirement to gain residency is complete.
Since I've moved here, I have worked with numerous clients on both small and grand scales. I've done everything from headshots for actors to jewelry designer campaigns to backstage editorial photo shoots for deisngers for fashion week. It has been a wonderful journey and I'm extremely grateful for all of the opportunities I've had the pleasure of receiving in the short span of 6 months that I've lived here. I've always had high hopes and ambtions with where I'm going in life and I definitely have the right amount of drive and persistence to make this happen! 
Heartbreak
My camera and all of my equipment was stolen on 2/19/13 while I was shooting an event a venue in the Williamsburg area of Brooklyn. Taken from me was my Nikon D200, VR 55-200mm lens, 18-55 lens, battery packs, chargers, bag, and a SB-800 flash. My camera and equipment means the world to me. It is the tool for my success and all of my creative endeavors. This camera was a gift to me from my wonderful Aunt and Uncle and the VR 55-200mm lens was a going away/good luck gift from very close family member of mine. Everything I owned has the utmost sentimental value to me - and now it's gone. Not only did I lose items that held incredible personal value, I also lost the tools of my craft that were intended to help me succeed in this intense, competitive journey I decided to embark on.
 
Please Help Me
While I have worked a lot since I've moved to this city, most of my work leading up to this point has been pro bono or voluntary work in order to gain connections, strengthen my resume and expand my portfolio. With that being said, I don't have the funds necessary to replace my equipment. I've finally gotten to the point where I have steady bookings for many different projects and assignments and things were definitely picking up for me leading up to this point. With my camera being stolen, I will most definitely lose clients and contacts considering the fact that I will no longer be able to work for them without my camera and equipment.
In order to replace my equipment in time for my clients' projects, I will have to work hard to raise approximately $1575 in the next 20 days. With this amount of money, I will be able to get back on track and continue to follow my dreams and ambitions! I will be purchasing another camera sufficient to my line of work as well as a flash, a standard lens and a zoom lens. Everything else that was taken, I will hopefully replace over time but these things are the most important items at this time! If you can contribute something, ANYTHING - It will mean the world to me because you're helping me continue to follow my dreams and desires!

If you can't contribute, that's fine! Please just spread the word about my indiegogo page to anyone who will listen or might be interested! I need all the help I can get and I will forever remain grateful to everyone even if I don't make my deadline.

In addition, import duties and taxes are NOT INCLUDED in our reward levels. These charges vary by country and are completely out of our control.

Any changes that we determine to be incorporated into the design and functionality of the camera strap will come directly from backers.</p><p>In the past, we released the original version of the Universal Lens Cap, made NO changes to the lens cap throughout the life of the Kickstarter Campaign and then, after 8 months of shipping out orders and recognizing common themes, requests and suggestions for how to make the product even more desirable amongst photographers, we launched v2 of the Universal Lens Cap (Micro &amp; Magnum) and did so with the all the modifications already in place... which meant going through another Kickstarter Campaign without having incorporating any kind of structural or functional enhancement.</p><p>However, because the Universal Camera Strap came about in large part thanks to backers, we're wanting to head into this campaign making sure that we attend to all the revisions, alterations, modifications, enhancements etc. WHILE the Kickstarter Campaign is live so as to incorporate any enhancements into the Universal Camera Strap before heading into the 'mass-production' phase and eventually begin shipping pledges to backers.,</p><p>Luckily, we already have the factories, communication channels and lead-times figured out. And, because we've made sure to add a 'buffer' of time for unforeseen hiccups, we feel confident that any amelioration of the camera strap can be incorporated into the molds so that everyone enjoys it while still fulfilling on time!</p><p>There are always unforeseeable risks, setbacks and hiccups which is why we plan to be transparent and do everything we can to keep our customers (you, the backer) happy.

In addition, we will not replace lost or stolen Universal Camera Straps.If your camera breaks while using our product, we are not liable for your camera gear, its repair/replacement, nor act as a financial insurance agency against potentially harmful issues to your camera equipment. The Universal Camera Strap acts as an accessory to help enhance your shooting experience. That is it. We strongly advise you seek out and invest in insurance for your gear just as any other professional would do in any other industry! :)Customs & DutiesUnfortunately, we cannot mark any pledge/reward as a 'gift', except for those pledges that end up receiving some sort of free item with their order. In addition, import duties and taxes are NOT INCLUDED in our reward levels. These charges vary by country and are completely out of our control. We are shipping the Universal Camera Strap all over the world and it is impossible for us to build the various customs charges into the various reward levels of Kickstarter.But, this online tool can help you calculate additional costs;http://www.importcalculator.comRemember, we are the creators of KUVRD and its products, not international customs. You can use this tool as estimates when determining additional costs in receiving our products.30-Day Money Back Guarantee As stated in our warranty section, we will happily replace the Universal Camera Strap for any defects in material and/or workmanship. We also provide a 30-Day Money Back Guarantee Policy. If you're unsatisfied with the Universal Camera Strap for any reason - within the first 30 days of receiving the Universal Camera Strap - we'll send you a full refund. We're not here to take advantage of our backers nor exploit their belief in us by sending them something they weren't expecting or are unsatisfied with.Just remember, every dollar from this campaign will be directly used to paying off mold fees, patent fees, actually producing the camera strap and the associating components, producing the packaging, fulfilling those orders and paying off all other expenses incurred thus far.Risks and ChallengesOur biggest foreseeable challenge will be handling and communicating any structural modifications, aesthetic revisions or altering some aspect of the camera strap and STILL fulfill within our estimated deadlines. Any changes that we determine to be incorporated into the design and functionality of the camera strap will come directly from backers.In the past, we released the original version of the Universal Lens Cap, made NO changes to the lens cap throughout the life of the Kickstarter Campaign and then, after 8 months of shipping out orders and recognizing common themes, requests and suggestions for how to make the product even more desirable amongst photographers, we launched v2 of the Universal Lens Cap (Micro & Magnum) and did so with the all the modifications already in place... which meant going through another Kickstarter Campaign without having incorporating any kind of structural or functional enhancement.However, because the Universal Camera Strap came about in large part thanks to backers, we're wanting to head into this campaign making sure that we attend to all the revisions, alterations, modifications, enhancements etc. WHILE the Kickstarter Campaign is live so as to incorporate any enhancements into the Universal Camera Strap before heading into the 'mass-production' phase and eventually begin shipping pledges to backers.,Luckily, we already have the factories, communication channels and lead-times figured out. And, because we've made sure to add a 'buffer' of time for unforeseen hiccups, we feel confident that any amelioration of the camera strap can be incorporated into the molds so that everyone enjoys it while still fulfilling on time!There are always unforeseeable risks, setbacks and hiccups which is why we plan to be transparent and do everything we can to keep our customers (you, the backer) happy.

I have skipped meals, danced past the opportunity of having a roof over my head, and fled the chance to hold someone close at night to be entwined with my passion for pictures.

Bio

Hello!! My name is Jenni. I am a 24 year old woman, currently seeking to manifest my dreams and goals into this reality. My quest for happiness has taken me around various states, attempting to find my calling in life. My most recent modeling endeavor has landed me in Ferndale MI, 15 minutes north of Detroit. One of my favorite cities in the whole world. One thing has held true over my travels, and that is photography. I have skipped meals, danced past the opportunity of having a roof over my head, and fled the chance to hold someone close at night to be entwined with my passion for pictures. I believe photography helps my imagination grow and keeps my heart calm. I have explored many things with photography, but not nearly enough. Fueled with passion and drive, I have learned from myself as well as my friends along the way.


Why a campaign?

I created this campaign to help me further my photographic adventures. I've had to pass up many great personal image and job opportunities due to a lack of professional lighting equipment. There are many tricks I'd love to perform, and emotions I need to capture, but these are not feasible without the correct lighting equipment. I hope to have the chance to pursue my artistic dreams in the near future. That is why I am here on this site, asking for help from all of you. Please help me light my way.


Why Help?

By helping me, you are helping an individual in the world make their dreams come true. You will be aiding my understanding of existence, helping it come to life through imagery. You can help inspire others, you will help build art, and push these things further and deeper into the world, and our minds.  
What kind of help, and what I can offer.


How much, and why.

I am asking for $2,000 for the perfect starters light kit. I would love nothing more than the opportunity to continue taking my photography to the professional level and not have to turn down paid jobs, as well as compromise my vision.


What if you don't reach your goal?

If my goal is not reached I will still acquire parts to the light kit! I am not going to just lay down and let this opportunity pass me. I am determined to make this dream come true! 


What is in it for you?

As donations come in I will be setting prizes/rewards/treats for all of the people who make this possible for me. 
bounty will include, but is not limited to (at least not yet)

Public thanks

       George Denisov started his business in mobile phones and accessories in early 2000. His MXS Ltd was booming together with the blossom of the first smartphones and tablets market. The further business development required strong ties with Hong Kong and China. With a MBA and PhD in Law, George’s meticulous nature pushes the DreamGrip product and team to a point of perfection.In late 2015 George developed the concept of DreamGrip™, and spring 2016 the first prototype was tested. It took a while to bring the product from just a concept to fully functional filming system. And even now he is 100% focused on the product to secure and tackle all the issues of preparing for mass production.Broderick is a digital filmmaker by education but has carried his vision forward in a number of companies and a number of global brands. In 2005 Brodie founded a company called The Media Merchants (TMM) replacing traditional billboards with projections onto building walls and surfaces. TMM executed projects all across North America, Brazil, and Africa.Since 2013 Broderick has been working with startups in Canada, China, and Southeast Asia in respect to drones, IOT, and digital content. It is important for him to be at the forefront of innovation whle hitting the market at the right time.  Which smartphones can I use with the DreamGrip™ system?You can use almost any smartphone, that has at least one camera; 15mm thick or slimmer; less than 105mm wide, and 170mm high.

<p>We wanted to improve on the auto-follow that exists now. We have made our auto-follow feature work to let you film yourself. This is super fun, as you can use it for action sports, from trail running and biking, to surfing and snow sports. Our auto-follow will continue to film you as you make turns and change direction, always keeping the camera on you. </p>

<p><i>In less than one day after I got the SDK with my Ghost, I was able to implement a simple app that can do speech control for my Ghost. I wish I could tell you how cool it is just as easily as I tell my Ghost to 'Take off!' - Felix W., Developer + Fan</i></p>
<p>In case you want to define your own way of flying your Ghost, every shipment comes with an extremely easy-to-use yet powerful and versatile software development kit (Ghost SDK). The Ghost SDK allows you to control your Ghost with commands as high level as ""take off,"" ""fly to xyz,"" ""loiter"" and ""land"" (and lets Ghost figure out how), or with as low level as setting the spinning speed of the propellers, the inclination of the drone body, or the orientation of the GoPro camera. With the Ghost SDK, you get full control and potential of your Ghost, and even the sky's NOT the limit any more.</p>

<p>For advanced control, use the micro control feature to make more precise adjustments to the drone in any direction. The smart phone screen is great for flying longer distances, but too small for pinpointing exact locations. Use micro control mode to adjust the drone's position in any direction over shorter distances. Slide in the direction you want the drone to move and watch Ghost go. Moving up will make the head of the ghost fly forward (red lights). Moving down will make it fly tail first (blue lights). (In Auto Mode, Ghost flies head first only).</p>

<p>Ghost is compatible with GoPro, including Hero4.

<p>We know delays have been a challenge in crowd funding campaigns, and have chosen to launch when we could deliver the product to you. Our manufacturers have been great partners. They have helped us shorten production lead-times for parts, so that we can quickly assemble Ghost once orders are placed. We own our own assembly factories, which helps us execute quickly.</p>
<p>This also allows Ehang to deliver Ghost to you at an amazing price. While it's fun to play with, Ghost is meant for high performance seekers looking for amazing aerial shots. We have worked hard to deliver high quality hardware components and develop user-friendly software technology. </p>

<p>We are an international team of flight enthusiasts and adventurers, and founded Ehang to remove the barriers to drone use so everyone could enjoy aerial filming. Drones are traditionally hard to pilot, easy to crash, and expensive. We developed our first product, the Ghost Drone, to address these challenges so you can discover a new way to capture magic around the earth. </p>
<p>Pre-order your drone to help us generate the volume we need to lower the cost for you and bring you additional features. Vote with your dollars and tell us which features you want us to develop.<br/><br/>Unlike many other drones being advertised, the Ghost Drone will be ready to ship between mid-December and end of January at the latest. With its lower price point and easy-to-use smartphone app, the Ghost Drone will make the perfect gift for first-time users and drone lovers alike.<br/></p>

The more demand we have, the more we can pass those savings to consumers through special deals, additional accessories and features.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">While we are relatively new, our engineers have extensive experience in hardware and software, and have been developing Ghost for over a year. Throughout the course of R&amp;D, we have created several generations of Ghost prototypes and have continuously improved functionality based on repeated testing. We are now fine tuning our design for mass production.</span></p>
<p>We have seen with crowd funding campaigns before us that
hiccups might happen, especially in the manufacturing process. To minimize this
risk, we have established strong relationships with parts manufacturers. We
also own our own factories that are responsible for final assembly and shipping,
making this a very smooth, reliable process. We understand that Indiegogo backers want their Ghost drones as soon as possible, but quality control
is at the top of the list. Even though we are confident we can deliver before the
holidays, there are always unforeseen challenges, or small changes that could
cause delays. We have tried to account for these by opening our
shipping window through end Jan.</p>
<p>Ghost drone has been repeatedly tested in lab and in real life, but we still expect issues to come up when put into unexpected
circumstances and uses, as we push its performance. We will continue to put
Ghost drones into the hands of developers, photographers, filmmakers, sports
enthusiasts and travelers for real-life testing to make sure we deliver the
best version. </p>
<p>With that said, the Ghost team thanks you for your support. We
are dedicated to our timeline and will keep you informed on the status of our
progress on the first of each month at a minimum, and will send further updates
as we have them. We are committed to being transparent and keeping Ghost fans
and Indiegogo backers informed. Our major milestones will be ship date,
development of iOS, and our stretch goals as stated above.</p>

<p><b><u>Company</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b>1.<span> 
</span></b><b>Where are you located? Do I have to contact
China if I have any issues?</b></p>
<p>We have an office in San Carlos, California, a short drive from
Palo Alto and San Francisco. We have a team there that will be able to answer
questions and help you if any issues arise. They are native English speakers,
so there should be no language barrier.</p>
<p><b>2.<span> 
</span></b><b>How long have you been around?</b></p>
<p>Our team in China has been working on the technology for 2 years,
but just released a small Alpha test of Ghost in China this April. This is our first launch and our first introduction to the
U.S. We hope you love Ghost!</p>
<p><b>3.<span> 
</span></b><b>What are your future plans?</b></p>
<p>We are super passionate about the way people move around the
world, and about flying, so we will continue to push technology in those areas.</p>
<p><b>4.<span> 
</span></b><b>Why are you crowd funding?</b></p>
<p>We are still a small company that used a crowd funding site to do a small beta test an earlier version of Ghost in
China. Now, we are doing the same in the U.S. We are hosting this pre-order
campaign to test our concept out with the Indiegogo community and reach some
early adopters who can be our partners, giving us feedback to make things
better and evolve the product with us.</p>
<p><b>5.<span> 
</span></b><b>How different are you than other drone companies?</b></p>
<p>First, we used videos of the Ghost actually flying. It was not shot with other drones or cameras. We actually used our auto-follow mode to film our runner at Stanford. We are ready to ship mid Dec-end Jan.</p>
<p>While we are working out certain features such as finalizing the
iPhone app (the hardware part), adding in the secret feature (we are almost
done and have already tested it), or adding in social features and integrating
wearables (also already underway), we are almost done with the technology. </p>
<p>Second,  while we share the
same passion as many of the other companies listed, and are personal friends
with a few of them, we are
quite different. Since our origins are in flight and model planes and
adventure, we take a very technical and personal approach to product
development. We want to make superior technical products very easy for the
average consumer to use. We will always push the technical side, while keeping the
consumer experience in mind. That’s why we were able to get auto-follow to work
as the most sophisticated version out there. That is also why we are going to
bring you the surprise development we stated in our $700K stretch goal. We wish
we could share, and are super excited, but need to make sure we nail down the
patent. And that is why we chose to pilot the drone with a smart phone.</p>
<p><b><u>Product (General)</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b>1.<span> 
</span></b><b>How does the technology actually work?</b></p>
<p>A small G-Box communicates with the phone through Bluetooth, and the G-Box communicates with the Ghost drone through wireless radio. It is all electrical and works with a battery.</p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">2. Auto
     follow sounds COOL! How does it work?</b></p>
<p>Ghost captures the GPS enabled on a smartphone/smart watch. Simply
press the Auto follow button, and our system does the rest. Currently, follow behind
is the default. However, other follow modes are under development. Keep an eye
out!</p>
<p><b>3.<span> 
</span></b><b>Does Ghost support night filming?</b></p>
<p>Ghost is visible in the dark, as it is equipped
with night mode flashing lights. Red indicates the head and blue the tail, so
you always know where Ghost is in the air and how it is oriented. The
definition of night shots depends on GoPro definition and ground luminosity. </p>
<p><b>4.<span> 
</span></b><b>How does Ghost behave in wind or rain?</b></p>
<p>Ghost is wind and water resistant. Tests have
shown that Ghost is able to fly in winds of up to 21 knot without significant
impact on video quality. Ghost is water resistant with fully enclosed
electronics. It works fine in light rain, but flying Ghost in heavy rain is
going to be a challenge. </p>
<p><b>5.<span>  </span></b><b>How
does Ghost handle obstacle avoidance?</b></p>
<p>The current system requires that you fly Ghost
in open areas. The reason is that the avoidance system is not currently in
place for the first version. We are working on incorporating the obstacle
avoidance function; a system update will be available and rolled out. </p>
<p><b><u>Software</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b>1.<span> 
</span></b><b>What if I don’t have an android?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While we are ready to ship out the Android
G-Box, we are still working on the iOS G-Box, which will be shipped in April. If
you decide to purchase Ghost now with an Android G-Box, we are happy to ship
you the iOS G-Box for an additional $50 (shipping included), which is way below
market price.</p>
<p><b>2.<span> 
</span></b><b>When is iPhone going to be ready?</b></p>
<p>The software already works. We are just working on the connection
with the G-Box. It should be ready by March 2015.</p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">3. What
     happens if the phone rings/ Ghost exceeds control range/ the battery runs
     out/ the GPS connection is lost</b></p>
<p>If you get a phone call while piloting Ghost, it will keep
executing your instructions uninterrupted. Safety features are incorporated
when facing failure scenarios. In case Ghost exceeds the control range (0.6
mile) or Radio Frequency connection is lost or broken, Ghost will kick into return mode. It
will automatically return to the place of origin and hover at 10 meters waiting for
further instruction (landing). If the battery drops to below 10%, you will get
a voice alert.</p>
<p><b>4. What if I don't have cell service? Can I still fly Ghost?</b><br/></p>
<p>You will need data to download the map of your flying area. For places without cell service, you can always download your map in advance<br/></p>
<p><b><u>Hardware</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b>1.<span> 
</span></b><b>What if I want a color other than black or
white?</b></p>
<p>If we reach our stretch goal of $150K, we will be offering 5 new
colors that start being shipped in Feb 2015. If you want one of those, you can elect to
have us ship you your done after January. Otherwise, you can receive a black or
white one by mid-Dec/end Jan.</p>
<p><b>2.<span>  What's special about your 2D gimbal? What if I prefer using my own </span></b><b>gimbal?</b></p>
<p>Ghost's 2D gimbal excels at its stability, whether it has camera on or flies no-load.  The 2D gimbal keeps shots extremely steady and the camera pointed the same direction as Ghost banks and turns. It is compatible with all versions of GoPro or camera with similar size, and can also work independently with power supply. There is no need to set up and adjust the parameter. </p>
<p>You can definitely mount your own gimbal on Ghost out of box. Any type of GoPro-compatible 2D or 3D gimbal would work. No extra software or hardware update needed. We will also be offering
different gimbals (including 3D) in the future. </p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">3. Is
     it possible to fly Ghost manually using RC controller?</b></p>
<p>The answer is Yes!
Switching from autonomous to manual control is possible. We are developing
Ghost customized 8 channel receiver. That being said, Ghost is not compatible
with existing RC controllers. The reason for this is that drones are prone to
crashes when steered by RC controllers. To enhance steering safety and smooth
manual control, we decided to develop proprietary RC controllers.</p>
<p><b><u>Customer Service + SHIPPING</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b>1.<span> 
</span></b><b>What is your return policy/warranty?</b></p>
<p>We are here to support you as you start flying Ghost. Firstly, we
will be launching a how-to video and include a super simple visual manual for
you, so that you know what you are doing, and avoid common mistakes.</p>
<p>If you encounter any serious problems or defects, you may contact
us in the U.S., and we can assist you. We definitely stand behind our products
and want to make sure you have the best experience.</p>
<p>That said, we cannot replace every Ghost that has simply been
crashed due to user error, but are here to make sure you avoid that. If you
keep it in auto mode and fly in areas high enough to avoid obstacles, you
should be all set.</p>
<p>Also, we are always here to listen to your feedback. Call or email
us!</p>
<p><b>2.<span> 
</span></b><b>Do you ship international?</b></p>
<p>Yes. We charge $25 for Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. $50 everywhere else. Distributor orders will be coordinated and priced out separately.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>3.<span> 
</span></b><b>What do you charge for shipping?</b></p>
<p>We charge $25 for shipping in the United States, including Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico.  $50 everywhere else. Distributor orders will be coordinated and priced out separately.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>4.<span> 
</span></b><b>Why is the shipping window mid-Dec to end of
Jan?</b></p>
<p>We wanted to be incredibly careful to not over-promise and
disappoint. While we are confident in mid-December, we wanted to set
expectations that delays could happen around the holidays and betting on end
Jan would be better. If we do better than that, we look forward to surprising
you with a holiday treat from Ghost. This is also why we offer gift cards for
your loved ones. In case the physical product does not reach them in time, you
can take a gift card to them.</p>
<p><b>5. </b><b>Am I supposed to manually add shipping?</b></p>
Yes, you have to add shipping on top of your selected perk before checkout!. Add $25 for shipping within United States, Canada, Mexico or Puerto Rico; or $50 for shipping elsewhere. Instructions are also clarified in Perks.</div>
<div>
<b>6. </b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What if I already contributed and forgot to add shipping?</b><p></p>
<p>For shipping within United States, Canada, Mexico or Puerto Rico, use the same email address as your other contributions and select perk ""I FORGOT SHIPPING $25"" using  . For shipping elsewhere, select perk ""I FORGOT SHIPPING $50"".</p>

</div></div>","Ghost is the world's easiest drone to fly. It is perfect for first-timers and experienced pilots alike.  Help us make drones more accessible to everyone!


With our smartphone app and a GoPro, you can become an aerial filmmaker. Be the star of your adventures!


There is no bulky RC controller to carry around. You also don't need a co-pilot, since control is through one-click commands on your phone. Auto-follow mode keeps the camera on you.





Ghost arrives ready to use and fully assembled.  A small G-Box communicates between
the smartphone and the drone. The 2D gimbal fits a GoPro and keeps your shot stable. No need for a buddy or expensive helicopter. You
can record all of your adventures easily and share them with your
friends. 



We wanted to improve on the auto-follow that exists now. We have made our auto-follow feature work to let you film yourself. This is super fun, as you can use it for action sports, from trail running and biking, to surfing and snow sports. Our auto-follow will continue to film you as you make turns and change direction, always keeping the camera on you. 

Here is a clip of an actual auto follow trial we did at Stanford. Our runner is holding the phone and small G-Box (about the size of the phone), and the Ghost is filming her with a GoPro3+ Black Edition.


In less than one day after I got the SDK with my Ghost, I was able to implement a simple app that can do speech control for my Ghost. I wish I could tell you how cool it is just as easily as I tell my Ghost to 'Take off!' - Felix W., Developer + Fan
In case you want to define your own way of flying your Ghost, every shipment comes with an extremely easy-to-use yet powerful and versatile software development kit (Ghost SDK). The Ghost SDK allows you to control your Ghost with commands as high level as ""take off,"" ""fly to xyz,"" ""loiter"" and ""land"" (and lets Ghost figure out how), or with as low level as setting the spinning speed of the propellers, the inclination of the drone body, or the orientation of the GoPro camera. With the Ghost SDK, you get full control and potential of your Ghost, and even the sky's NOT the limit any more.



Additional funding will let us give you even more great features for your drone. We have already started development, and want you to tell us which ones you want and help us deliver them to you!
Help us offer you more colors. If we reach $150K in funding, we will give our supporters on Indiegogo the chance to vote for their top 5 favorite new colors* to add to our offering. If you want a new color, you will receive it starting Feb 2015. Otherwise, choose black or white for a ship date of Dec 2014-Jan 2015.
*Please note: Colors pictured are just placeholders. We will offer a large selection of colors from which our voters can choose, and narrow it down to the top 5. We will also allow for personal submissions. We want you to choose!



Integrate with waterproof smartwatch to make it hands-free and take it on your adventures.



We have updated our $500K stretch goal to the new TILT MODE. Like nothing you have ever seen, it revolutionizes the way you control the drone by simply tilting your phone! You can use this feature both outdoors and indoors. 
Help us put it in every Ghost, and make it work with iOS (currently works with Android).
""[Co-founder] Xiong highlighted two ""breakthrough"" features on the Ghost: smartphone-tilt control and an auto-follow mode that's starting to become the norm. The former is very much what it says on the tin: Once the Ghost is in the air, you can rotate and tilt your phone as if you're doing the same to the drone."" - Engadget 
Here is a video of our team using the new TILT mode. You asked for more Ghost footage, so here it is. All aerials in this video were shot with Ghost.


This time, you decide!
We've made over $500K in just 3 weeks. Now, help us determine our next stretch goal! Where do you want Ghost to go? What do you want it to do? Vote now and tell us what you want next! https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/FR992S3








 
Travel light with just your phone, and let Auto Mode do the flying, so you can focus on generating the perfect shot. Point your finger on the map, and the drone flies to that spot. No bulky RC controller to carry around. Just your phone and a small G-Box.


Take off, hover, return and land are all pre-programmed for you. The app will alert you when the battery is low. This makes flying easy, so you can focus on getting amazing pictures.


Control the height and orientation of your drone by sliding the bars. Vertical bar controls the altitude. Horizontal bar rotates the drone to swivel the camera around to capture the perfect angle. 


Control the angle of your GoPro to shoot versatile videos. Vertical bar allows you to tilt the camera up toward the sky and down toward the ground. Horizontal bar allows tilting right and left.


For advanced control, use the micro control feature to make more precise adjustments to the drone in any direction. The smart phone screen is great for flying longer distances, but too small for pinpointing exact locations. Use micro control mode to adjust the drone's position in any direction over shorter distances. Slide in the direction you want the drone to move and watch Ghost go. Moving up will make the head of the ghost fly forward (red lights). Moving down will make it fly tail first (blue lights). (In Auto Mode, Ghost flies head first only).


Ghost is compatible with GoPro, including Hero4. A smartphone-app controlled 2D gimbal stabilizes your shot. Ghost is also wind resistant, water-proof, with automatic return if the connection is lost. Night mode has LED lights to track drone in the sky. This makes capturing images in these conditions possible.


You can integrate with a third-party recording monitor to preview your photos and videos as the drone is flying.





We know delays have been a challenge in crowd funding campaigns, and have chosen to launch when we could deliver the product to you. Our manufacturers have been great partners. They have helped us shorten production lead-times for parts, so that we can quickly assemble Ghost once orders are placed. We own our own assembly factories, which helps us execute quickly.
This also allows Ehang to deliver Ghost to you at an amazing price. While it's fun to play with, Ghost is meant for high performance seekers looking for amazing aerial shots. We have worked hard to deliver high quality hardware components and develop user-friendly software technology.

""[Ghost] drones makes controlling it as straight-forward and simple as possible through its mobile app."" - Slash Gear









We are an international team of flight enthusiasts and adventurers, and founded Ehang to remove the barriers to drone use so everyone could enjoy aerial filming. Drones are traditionally hard to pilot, easy to crash, and expensive. We developed our first product, the Ghost Drone, to address these challenges so you can discover a new way to capture magic around the earth. 
Pre-order your drone to help us generate the volume we need to lower the cost for you and bring you additional features. Vote with your dollars and tell us which features you want us to develop.Unlike many other drones being advertised, the Ghost Drone will be ready to ship between mid-December and end of January at the latest. With its lower price point and easy-to-use smartphone app, the Ghost Drone will make the perfect gift for first-time users and drone lovers alike.












Filmmakers & Photographers
Sports Enthusiasts
Travelers & Adventurers

Note: The latest G-Box does not have an antenna.

















We have already successfully developed key features like smartphone control and advanced auto-follow that actually work. Now we want you to help us launch Ghost into the U.S. market and take it to mass production through pre-orders and become an early adopter. There is no need to wait for months, as Ghost will be ready to ship as early as mid-December, just in time for the holidays, but no later than end of January (for black and white colors). The more demand we have, the more we can pass those savings to consumers through special deals, additional accessories and features. Take a look at our stretch goals below.  Help us develop Ghost and give us feedback to make it even better.

While we are relatively new, our engineers have extensive experience in hardware and software, and have been developing Ghost for over a year. Throughout the course of R&D, we have created several generations of Ghost prototypes and have continuously improved functionality based on repeated testing. We are now fine tuning our design for mass production.
We have seen with crowd funding campaigns before us that
hiccups might happen, especially in the manufacturing process. To minimize this
risk, we have established strong relationships with parts manufacturers. We
also own our own factories that are responsible for final assembly and shipping,
making this a very smooth, reliable process. We understand that Indiegogo backers want their Ghost drones as soon as possible, but quality control
is at the top of the list. Even though we are confident we can deliver before the
holidays, there are always unforeseen challenges, or small changes that could
cause delays. We have tried to account for these by opening our
shipping window through end Jan.
Ghost drone has been repeatedly tested in lab and in real life, but we still expect issues to come up when put into unexpected
circumstances and uses, as we push its performance. We will continue to put
Ghost drones into the hands of developers, photographers, filmmakers, sports
enthusiasts and travelers for real-life testing to make sure we deliver the
best version. 
With that said, the Ghost team thanks you for your support. We
are dedicated to our timeline and will keep you informed on the status of our
progress on the first of each month at a minimum, and will send further updates
as we have them. We are committed to being transparent and keeping Ghost fans
and Indiegogo backers informed. Our major milestones will be ship date,
development of iOS, and our stretch goals as stated above.

A small G-Box communicates with the phone through Bluetooth, and the G-Box communicates with the Ghost drone through wireless radio. It is all electrical and works with a battery.
2. Auto
     follow sounds COOL! How does it work?
Ghost captures the GPS enabled on a smartphone/smart watch. Simply
press the Auto follow button, and our system does the rest. Currently, follow behind
is the default. However, other follow modes are under development. Keep an eye
out!
3. 
Does Ghost support night filming?
Ghost is visible in the dark, as it is equipped
with night mode flashing lights. Red indicates the head and blue the tail, so
you always know where Ghost is in the air and how it is oriented. The
definition of night shots depends on GoPro definition and ground luminosity. 
4. 
How does Ghost behave in wind or rain?
Ghost is wind and water resistant. Tests have
shown that Ghost is able to fly in winds of up to 21 knot without significant
impact on video quality. Ghost is water resistant with fully enclosed
electronics. It works fine in light rain, but flying Ghost in heavy rain is
going to be a challenge. 
5.  How
does Ghost handle obstacle avoidance?
The current system requires that you fly Ghost
in open areas. The reason is that the avoidance system is not currently in
place for the first version. We are working on incorporating the obstacle
avoidance function; a system update will be available and rolled out. 
Software

1. 
What if I don’t have an android?


While we are ready to ship out the Android
G-Box, we are still working on the iOS G-Box, which will be shipped in April. If
you decide to purchase Ghost now with an Android G-Box, we are happy to ship
you the iOS G-Box for an additional $50 (shipping included), which is way below
market price.
2. 
When is iPhone going to be ready?
The software already works. We are just working on the connection
with the G-Box. It should be ready by March 2015.
3. What
     happens if the phone rings/ Ghost exceeds control range/ the battery runs
     out/ the GPS connection is lost
If you get a phone call while piloting Ghost, it will keep
executing your instructions uninterrupted. Safety features are incorporated
when facing failure scenarios. In case Ghost exceeds the control range (0.6
mile) or Radio Frequency connection is lost or broken, Ghost will kick into return mode. It
will automatically return to the place of origin and hover at 10 meters waiting for
further instruction (landing). If the battery drops to below 10%, you will get
a voice alert.
4. What if I don't have cell service? Can I still fly Ghost?
You will need data to download the map of your flying area. For places without cell service, you can always download your map in advance
Hardware

1. 
What if I want a color other than black or
white?
If we reach our stretch goal of $150K, we will be offering 5 new
colors that start being shipped in Feb 2015. If you want one of those, you can elect to
have us ship you your done after January. Otherwise, you can receive a black or
white one by mid-Dec/end Jan.
2.  What's special about your 2D gimbal? What if I prefer using my own gimbal?
Ghost's 2D gimbal excels at its stability, whether it has camera on or flies no-load.  The 2D gimbal keeps shots extremely steady and the camera pointed the same direction as Ghost banks and turns. It is compatible with all versions of GoPro or camera with similar size, and can also work independently with power supply. There is no need to set up and adjust the parameter. 
You can definitely mount your own gimbal on Ghost out of box. Any type of GoPro-compatible 2D or 3D gimbal would work. No extra software or hardware update needed. We will also be offering
different gimbals (including 3D) in the future. 
3. Is
     it possible to fly Ghost manually using RC controller?
The answer is Yes!
Switching from autonomous to manual control is possible. We are developing
Ghost customized 8 channel receiver. That being said, Ghost is not compatible
with existing RC controllers. The reason for this is that drones are prone to
crashes when steered by RC controllers. To enhance steering safety and smooth
manual control, we decided to develop proprietary RC controllers.
Customer Service + SHIPPING

1. 
What is your return policy/warranty?
We are here to support you as you start flying Ghost. Firstly, we
will be launching a how-to video and include a super simple visual manual for
you, so that you know what you are doing, and avoid common mistakes.
If you encounter any serious problems or defects, you may contact
us in the U.S., and we can assist you. We definitely stand behind our products
and want to make sure you have the best experience.
That said, we cannot replace every Ghost that has simply been
crashed due to user error, but are here to make sure you avoid that. If you
keep it in auto mode and fly in areas high enough to avoid obstacles, you
should be all set.
Also, we are always here to listen to your feedback. Call or email
us!
2. 
Do you ship international?
Yes. We charge $25 for Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. $50 everywhere else. Distributor orders will be coordinated and priced out separately.

What do you charge for shipping?
We charge $25 for shipping in the United States, including Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico.  $50 everywhere else. Distributor orders will be coordinated and priced out separately.

4. 
Why is the shipping window mid-Dec to end of
Jan?
We wanted to be incredibly careful to not over-promise and
disappoint. While we are confident in mid-December, we wanted to set
expectations that delays could happen around the holidays and betting on end
Jan would be better. If we do better than that, we look forward to surprising
you with a holiday treat from Ghost. This is also why we offer gift cards for
your loved ones. In case the physical product does not reach them in time, you
can take a gift card to them.
5. Am I supposed to manually add shipping?
Yes, you have to add shipping on top of your selected perk before checkout!. Add $25 for shipping within United States, Canada, Mexico or Puerto Rico; or $50 for shipping elsewhere. Instructions are also clarified in Perks.

6. What if I already contributed and forgot to add shipping?
