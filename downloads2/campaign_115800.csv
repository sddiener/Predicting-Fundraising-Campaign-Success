<ul><li><h1>LE  BUDGET ET NOS BESOINS  <br/>
</h1></li></ul>
<p>Cela fait maintenant un an que nous nous préparons et montons le projet. Le budget estimé tourne autour de 25 000€ à 30 000€ en fonction des sommes que nous aurons à dépenser en cours de route et que nous ne maîtrisons pas totalement.</p>

</h3>Partir à vélo au long court, pour des contrées lointaines et pas 
forcément accueillantes pour l’homme, nécessite du matériel étudié et 
sélectionné avec soin : robuste, ergonomique, léger, réparable, adapté 
aux différents climats, il s'agit là des caractéristiques déterminantes à
 concilier pour un tel voyage. Cela exige en amont une vraie préparation ainsi qu’un travail de sélection et de test. <br/><br/><b>Si nous avons pu trouver un certains nombres de sponsors et partenaires (que nous remercions grandement), il nous reste encore du chemin à parcourir ! C'est pourquoi nous faisons appel à vous chers lecteurs pour nous aider à compléter l'achat de notre matériel à hauteur de 1 500 €.</b>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>Pour vous en dire un peu plus, nos précédentes expéditions nous ont permis de nous forger des avis bien tranchés et de répartir le budget selon 7 grandes catégories : <br/><br/></p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>Le « matériel vélo »</b> avec en premier lieu le « 2 roues » d’expédition : cadre robuste en acier, roues de 26 pouces, tout le matériel nécessaire à son bon fonctionnement et à l'entretien. Il s'agit du premier poste sur lequel nous nous sommes penchés : cadre en acier pour absorber les vibrations et facilement soudable.  <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Le matériel de camping</b> : comprend tout ce qui sert à se reposer ou à se nourrir, ni plus ni moins ! Nous ne comptons plus les heures que nous avons passées  Au Vieux Campeur ou encore à Décathlon !</li>
<li>
<b>Les vêtements</b>, pour ne pas mourir de chaud ni de froid. Légers et fonctionnels, ils doivent être adaptés aux différents climats auxquels nous serons soumis, ainsi qu’à la pratique du vélo. Et oui, dans certains pays, la température pourra descendre parfois jusqu'à -20°C lorsque nous y serons ! <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Le matériel de santé</b> : trousse à pharmacie de premiers soins, produits d’hygiène, et vaccins  indispensables pour la traversée de certains pays.</li>
<li>
<b>Le matériel ‘technologique’</b> : tout ce dont nous aurons besoin pour communiquer, échanger, enregistrer, se géo-localiser et déterminer précisément nos itinéraires. Résistants dans des conditions éprouvantes de températures, d’hygrométrie et de chocs, ces derniers sont relativement coûteux.</li>
<li>
<b>Les dépenses administratives</b> : Visas, frais bancaires, billet d'avion retour...<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Les dépenses quotidiennes durant un an</b>. Nous les estimons de 10€ à 15€/jour par personne.<br/>
</li>
</ol>

<br/>Afin de pouvoir vous ramener des images et vidéos toujours plus belles et communiquer en ligne et actualiser notre site internet tout au long du parcours, il nous reste à nous équiper de : <br/><br/><ul>
<li><b>un second appareil photo</b></li>
<li><b>une caméra embarquée</b></li>
<li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">une paire de jumelles </b><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>une tablette numérique</b>  </li>
</ul>Le montant nécessaire s'élève à<b> 1 500 €. Il s'agit donc de notre but à atteindre via le ""crowdfunding"".</b><br/><br/>C'est pourquoi nous faisons aujourd'hui appel à vous et à votre générosité chers lecteurs pour porter votre contribution à cette aventure en nous aidant à financer ces derniers équipements. <br/><ul><br/></ul>

Au programme : sport, découvertes, rencontres et architecture durable !


Notre projet d’expédition consiste à relier à vélo les deux extrémités du continent eurasien. Partant de Quimper, petite ville du Finistère, la ""pointe du monde"" occidental, dont nous sommes tous les deux originaires, nous rejoindrons à la force de nos mollets, Pékin, capitale du pays le plus dynamique de notre époque. Munis de nos vélos et sacoches, nous passerons par 21 pays, en 330 jours, et cela avec des conditions climatiques souvent rigoureuses. 
>> Nous quittons la France courant octobre 2014 ! <<

Si l’un des objectifs principaux de ce projet reste l’expérience d’une
aventure sportive et humaine riche à travers l'Eurasie, le second consiste à étudier les l'architecture traditionnelle, ou ""Architecture Vernaculaire"", des régions traversées et des intérêts de sa potentielle réappropriation pour la conception moderne de bâtiments et de villes plus écologiques et durables.
Et oui, même LeMonde.fr le dit : la réactualisation du vernaculaire ""s'inscrit pleinement dans notre époque et répond parfaitement aux questions actuelles sur l'avenir de la planète en s'appuyant sur le recyclage de matériaux locaux aux vertus bioclimatiques.""
""Encore expérimental, le vernaculaire va désormais se généraliser.""

Le fait de nous déplacer à vélo est une approche simple et sans prétention,  première étape vers le dialogue. Ainsi le déplacement à vélo favorise l’échange et permet d’établir un contact authentique avec les populations rencontrées. Le fait de couvrir près de 18 000 km à vélo à travers plus de 20 pays permet de multiplier les variations culturelles et de rendre d'autant plus pertinente l'étude des bâtiments traditionnels !









QUI SOMMES NOUS ? 
Vincent Helpin et Simon Fournier, deux jeunes ingénieurs âgés de 27 ans.


Amis de longue date, tous les deux originaires de la région de Quimper en Bretagne, nous n’avons jamais été très éloignés l’un de l’autre durant notre enfance, que ce soit à l’école, en vacances, à la plage, ou sur les terrains de sport.Nous avons ensuite suivi le même parcours post-bac : classes préparatoires à Rennes, puis écoles d’ingénieurs. Aujourd’hui nous exerçons tous les deux la même profession, à savoir ingénieur en performance énergétique et environnementale du bâtiment.Sportifs depuis l'enfance, nous avons testé nos ambitions en pédalant dans une entente parfaite plus de 1 100 km à vélo entre Paris et Berlin en Mai 2013, et 700 km entre Nantes et Saint-Jean de Luz en Août 2013. Depuis, l’envie commune de réaliser un voyage à vélo de bien plus grande envergure, nous motive plus que jamais !
      


LE PROJET ET SES ENJEUX 
La finalité du voyage est de promouvoir, pour la conception moderne de bâtiments, les intérêts oubliés des constructions traditionnelles représentatives de centaines d’années d’expérimentations et de réflexions de l’homme pour se protéger des contraintes climatiques locales.
Ce projet et ses potentiels intérêts font écho à de nombreuses problématiques qui découlent du développement durable puisque le secteur de la construction est le principal responsable des problèmes de la société moderne : 
                    - 45% de notre consommation énergétique
                    - 22% des émissions de CO2 françaises
En parallèle, en 2013, la facture énergétique de la France a augmenté de 12 % en 2013 et représente 3.5% du PIB français contre à peine 1%  dans les années 90... Les ménages les plus pauvres consacrent près de 15% de leur revenu aux dépenses énergétiques. (chiffres ADEME)

""Le secteur du bâtiment constitue donc un immense gisement d'économie d'énergie sur lequel il est possible d'agir à court et moyen termes !""

Face à ce constat et aux problèmes d'urbanisation rapide, les politiques, urbanistes, architectes et scientifiques sont alors de plus en plus amenés à se poser les questions suivantes : 

""Comment construire de meilleures villes pour offrir de meilleures vies ?""
""Comment construire en respectant les traditions ancestrales d’un territoire ?""
""Comment intégrer intelligemment les contraintes environnementales à venir dans le secteur de la construction ?""

Nous sommes tous les deux convaincus que l'étude des principes vernaculaires ancestraux à travers le monde est une source d'inspiration et de réflexion plus que pertinente !

Au retour de notre voyage, nos études et analyses réalisées sur la route nous serviront pour monter un reportage et une étude plus poussée sur les intérêts d'une réactualisation des principes astucieux des bâtiments. En effet, ces derniers ont traversé les siècles grâce à une agrégation d'enseignements à travers les âges mais aujourd'hui ils sont presque partout oubliés. Nous réaliserons une restitution commune avec un ami qui, lui, voyagera en Océanie et Amérique du Sud.
Nous travaillons avec l'association d'utilité publique Maisons Paysannes de France,  avec qui nous serons présents en Novembre 2015 au musée du Louvre pour la Semaine du Patrimoine !

LE  BUDGET ET NOS BESOINS  

Cela fait maintenant un an que nous nous préparons et montons le projet. Le budget estimé tourne autour de 25 000€ à 30 000€ en fonction des sommes que nous aurons à dépenser en cours de route et que nous ne maîtrisons pas totalement.
 
Partir à vélo au long court, pour des contrées lointaines et pas 
forcément accueillantes pour l’homme, nécessite du matériel étudié et 
sélectionné avec soin : robuste, ergonomique, léger, réparable, adapté 
aux différents climats, il s'agit là des caractéristiques déterminantes à
 concilier pour un tel voyage. Cela exige en amont une vraie préparation ainsi qu’un travail de sélection et de test. Si nous avons pu trouver un certains nombres de sponsors et partenaires (que nous remercions grandement), il nous reste encore du chemin à parcourir ! C'est pourquoi nous faisons appel à vous chers lecteurs pour nous aider à compléter l'achat de notre matériel à hauteur de 1 500 €.

Pour vous en dire un peu plus, nos précédentes expéditions nous ont permis de nous forger des avis bien tranchés et de répartir le budget selon 7 grandes catégories : 


Le « matériel vélo » avec en premier lieu le « 2 roues » d’expédition : cadre robuste en acier, roues de 26 pouces, tout le matériel nécessaire à son bon fonctionnement et à l'entretien. Il s'agit du premier poste sur lequel nous nous sommes penchés : cadre en acier pour absorber les vibrations et facilement soudable.  


Le matériel de camping : comprend tout ce qui sert à se reposer ou à se nourrir, ni plus ni moins ! Nous ne comptons plus les heures que nous avons passées  Au Vieux Campeur ou encore à Décathlon !

Les vêtements, pour ne pas mourir de chaud ni de froid. Légers et fonctionnels, ils doivent être adaptés aux différents climats auxquels nous serons soumis, ainsi qu’à la pratique du vélo. Et oui, dans certains pays, la température pourra descendre parfois jusqu'à -20°C lorsque nous y serons ! 


Le matériel de santé : trousse à pharmacie de premiers soins, produits d’hygiène, et vaccins  indispensables pour la traversée de certains pays.

Le matériel ‘technologique’ : tout ce dont nous aurons besoin pour communiquer, échanger, enregistrer, se géo-localiser et déterminer précisément nos itinéraires. Résistants dans des conditions éprouvantes de températures, d’hygrométrie et de chocs, ces derniers sont relativement coûteux.

Les dépenses administratives : Visas, frais bancaires, billet d'avion retour...


Les dépenses quotidiennes durant un an. Nous les estimons de 10€ à 15€/jour par personne.



Afin de pouvoir vous ramener des images et vidéos toujours plus belles et communiquer en ligne et actualiser notre site internet tout au long du parcours, il nous reste à nous équiper de : 
un second appareil photo
une caméra embarquée

une paire de jumelles 


une tablette numérique  
Le montant nécessaire s'élève à 1 500 €. Il s'agit donc de notre but à atteindre via le ""crowdfunding"".C'est pourquoi nous faisons aujourd'hui appel à vous et à votre générosité chers lecteurs pour porter votre contribution à cette aventure en nous aidant à financer ces derniers équipements. 



L’une de ces expressions vous parle ou l’un des fils directeurs de 
notre périple vous intéresse ? Nous  vous  invitons  alors  à  saisir  
l’opportunité  de  soutenir  cette aventure ambitieuse ! Nous le rappelons, nous ne sollicitons le financement participatif qu'à hauteur de 1 500 € sur la totalité du budget de 30 000 € ; et cela en vue de parfaire l'équipement technologique !







UNE AVENTURE A PARTAGER ! 




Comme vous le savez, le bouche à oreille n'a jamais aussi bien fonctionné qu'aujourd'hui ! Alors même si vous ne pouvez nous aider financièrement mais que notre projet vous séduit nous vous remercions de partager à vos amis, collègues proches ou non cette aventure trépidante dans laquelle nous nous lançons ! N'hésitez plus ! A vos Likes et autres Tweet :) De notre côté, dès la création du projet, nous avons tenu à sensibiliser les plus jeunes aux bienfaits du voyages et aux problématiques environnementales. En effet, nous travaillons avec les élèves d’un collège finistérien et leur professeur en vue de leur apporter un regard original sur le monde. Nous
restons vivement intéressés pour recevoir le concours de toute
personne physique ou morale souhaitant s’investir dans ce projet :
possibilités de promouvoir le projet, propositions de compétences, de contacts
médiatiques, de mises en relation, sont autant d’aspects importants pouvant
contribuer à mener à bien cette aventure sportive et environnementale !

<p>That's how the Grady Diet started. I certainly never set out to write a diet book. Holy cow, I'm the last person you'd expect to write a diet book.

That's where you come in.</p>
<p>My passion is helping people. Before launching the book on Amazon Kindle, I believe a little publicity will do a lot to help the book reach the many people who can benefit from its simple ideas.

<p>My diet differs from other diets in major ways: it’s designed to be a brief read you can go back to again and again, for inspiration for courage. It’s not <em>War and Peace</em>. You can refer to the ladder chart, leaf a meaningful chapter or a read a tiny nugget to inspire you. And the book is funny. It’s got cartoons and a mascot, Sparky Spaniel, to cheer you on the right path. Laugh and lose, I say.</p>
<p>America's epic failure to multiply happiness and fitness for our people witnesses the futility of conventional diet approaches. If anything, the conventional approaches have been phenomenally successful at increasing the ranks of the overweight. <strong>What You Can Do: <em>The Grady Diet</em></strong> contains something a lot of people need— the shockingly simple tools to attain the body and lives we desire.</p>
<p>The diet and book developed so spontaneously, it still amazes me. First a guy in the dry cleaners asked me what I’d done to lose so much weight. I gladly wrote up a sheet of pointers for him.

<strong>FAQ #3:</strong> Anonymity!</h2>
<p>We've had a few people ask, so we'd like to clarify, the having your name listed with the contributors is totally optional. You will have the chance to choose if and how your name appears!</p>
<h2><strong>FAQ #2: Let's look at some art!</strong></h2>
<p>Amanda Gannon is half of our team, and in addition to barking at strangers and talking to imaginary people, one of her hobbies is making art. Most of it is pretty cool.</p>
<p>She started on the art for the incentive prints today, and should have it done by the end of the campaign. That's not soon enough to give y'all an idea of what it will look like, though, so we're giving you a look behind the scenes.</p>
<p>She's taking some very pretty but very small ink drawings she did a while back and is enlarging and improving them.  These are the originals she's working from:</p>
<p><img alt=""art nouveau chararcter portraits"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8308/7998576645_36e83bc108_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You can have prints of the final versions (again, not these, but super-incredibly-close), plus ebook, website membership for the duration of the serial, and listing with the contributors.</p>
<p>And someone, one lucky someone, will get the originals, which are 9x12, done in archival ink on vellum Bristol board.</p>
<h2><strong>FAQ #1: Let's talk about sex scenes.<br/></strong></h2>
<p>Holy wow, we are 30% funded in three days! Please keep spreading that word!</p>
<p>Today, I thought we should share details about the bonus scene perk with prospective backers.</p>
<p>If you are brave and awesome enough to take this perk, you will get a sex scene of at least 3,000 words. It will be published in the book for everyone to enjoy, but unless the backer requests a dedication, their name will not be connected with it. You can choose two or three characters (more than that is a logistical nightmare both in reality and in fiction) and we will sex 'em up. It doesn't have to be a canonical mix, and we do not care <em>one rodential posterior</em> about orientation. Three guys? We can do that. It's all good.<br/><br/>If you want a specific something included, we'll do our best to accommodate that (within reason; ""three weasels, some peanut butter, and a ping-pong-ball gun"" would obviously be over the line, although we might ask you to visit next time you come to town).</p>
<p>If you want a specific something NOT included, we can do that.<br/><br/>All attempts at gratifying kinks will be met with our best effort, and limits are pretty soft. We're open to negotiation on anything except for kids/pooping/barfing/serious bodily harm.<br/><br/>Backers will have the option - and it is totally optional - to make up a list of up to ten things that they really, really like. It's conceivable that this might embarrass some people terrifically, but we assure you, whatever you are into, we have probably written worse for ourselves.</p>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">It is a time of airships, decadence, and splendor, a mad king rules over a terrified populace. Justice is in chains, replaced by the mad king's whim, the populace brought to heel by fear.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Born a commoner, Count Varian's heart still lies with the people, and the crimes inflicted on the populace by mad King Marivane enrage him. He has played the part of noble long enough, and now he must play the part of hero. He becomes the Golden Mask, anonymity his only shield against a traitor's death.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Ambrel has returned from long exile, driven by rage to avenge the destruction of her house. As Lady Fox, she harries the corrupt nobility, seeking the heart of the conspiracy that destroyed her family. Her cunning and fearlessness drive the Golden Mask to seek her aid, aid she is not necessarily willing to give.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Opposing them are those who now rule from the shadows: the king's advisor Urza, who has the kingdom wrapped in his shadowy web; and Raziel Morningstar, who enforces Urza's will with fire and sword and cruelty. Both are said to possess unnatural powers, and both are hungry for more.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Those who resist are swiftly silenced. Mass arrests fill the cells of the Tower of Justice, where innocent citizens await execution for false crimes.  Others are murdered outright. Some simply . . . vanish.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">In a country in desperate need of heroes, who will be brave enough to answer that call?</p>
<h2>OH MY GOD, WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?</h2>
<p>Paul Batteiger is an author, and will be taking the authorial reins on this project. Amanda Gannon is an author and artist, and will be editing and constructing the artsy perks. She will also be handling some of the sex and bonus scenes.</p>
<p>We love to write adventure stories with the sex left in. We love it so much, we started up <a href=""http://www.adventurotica.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Adventurotica.com</a>, where we will publish <em>The Golden Mask</em> as a serial before releasing it as an ebook and a trade paperback.</p>
<p><em>The Golden Mask</em> is sort of like Zorro and Catwoman versus Darth Vader and Rasputin, with Caligula as king, wrapped up in Three Musketeers-style swashbuckling and tied together with string cheese. Only way, way sexier than that sounds. It is exactly the kind of full-throttle cheesy adventure that you, in your heart of hearts, crave . . . only we don't fade to black and leave you to write the slash parts yourselves. (Although if you want to, we won't complain.)</p>
<p>Anyway, it's going to be awesome. There will be masked heroes and villains, daring swordfights, railing kills, airships, riots, murder, conspiracy, and loads of crazy, groping, sweaty-palmed, panting, clenching, groin-grinding sex. We have an unlimited special effects budget and absolutely no limits on what our actors will and will not do, and we abuse these advantages shamelessly.</p>
<h2>WHAT WE NEED:</h2>
<p><strong>Money.</strong> (No point in beating around the bush.)</p>
<p>Here is how we will spend it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>A really cool cover.</strong> We'd like to pay someone to do this for us so our cover is not as awesomely bad as the trailer.</li>
<li>
<strong>Materials for the incentives.</strong> All that fun stuff has to come from somewhere!</li>
<li>
<strong>Living expenses.</strong> Food, bills, and a roof to turn away the life-leeching rays of the blazing hatestar – sorry, <em>the sun</em>. We have this annoying hierarchy of needs thing going on. <em>Damn you, Maslow!</em>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Medical care.</strong> Writing all these naughty words can be dangerous, you know. Paper cuts, repetitive stress injuries, tragic Hitachi accidents . . . it's a brutal line of work. (Have you ever tried to get lube out of a keyboard?) No, seriously, some of us need to be medicated for the public good.</li>
</ul><p>And there you have it. Most of it is going towards keeping us alive. Is that exciting? No! But we have to stay alive to write smut. Contrary to what you might think, zombies don't write very interesting sex scenes. It's just a lot of moaning and cannibalism.</p>
<h2>WHAT YOU GET:</h2>
<p>The warm and fuzzy feeling of helping independent artists eke out a living pursuing their dream of providing quality adult entertainment to the teeming, hairy-palmed masses?</p>
<p>Not enough? Oh, <em>fine</em>.</p>
<p>Off to the right is a list of neat stuff we think you might enjoy, such as handmade bookmarks, art prints, and crazy things we are willing to do with words.</p>
<p><strong>Do you read good books?</strong> (We hope so. Although evil eldritch tomes are also cool.) Old grocery lists and used envelopes are not worthy placeholders! You need something classy, like a velvet ribbon bookmark with dangly little charms! Default size will fit a regular paperback, but we can make them to any length you want.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever wanted a gruesome literary death?</strong> We have you covered. It's far more convenient than actually <em>experiencing</em> a gruesome death!</p>
<p><strong>Frustrated by how your OTP never got it on?</strong> We have a perk for that, allowing you to order up a sexy scene featuring your favorite two (or three) characters. Doesn't even have to be canon, and we are extremely open-minded about content. We don't judge. Unless that's your thing.</p>
<p><strong>Are you feeling the lack of art in your life?</strong> Amanda – and you can see more of her work <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/naamah_darling/sets/72157600049025088/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here </a>– will be drawing Nouveau-inspired portraits of Lady Fox and The Golden Mask, which will be turned into prints.  Or you can have the originals, if you're quick. We'll even make them an easy-to-frame standard US size.</p>
<p><strong>Want to celebrate your unspeakable crimes?</strong> We can fix you up with a personalized Wanted poster. Think of it as advertising for your villainous services. You may never get a better chance to brag.</p>
<p><strong>Need to conceal your identity from your enemies?</strong> We'll give you the actual (insert theme music here) GOLDEN MASK. (The <em>mask</em> mask. Not the guy <em>in</em> the mask. Sorry. It's really hard fitting an entire action hero into a flat-rate shipping box without getting gruesome.)</p>
<p>At the <em>very least</em>, you will be getting an awesome swashbuckling erotic adventure story delivered to your inbox. I am not seeing a downside. Unless you share an email address with your mother. How embarrassing.</p>
<h2>WHAT HAPPENS:</h2>
<p>We post the book serially on our site. This will be our 6<sup>th</sup> novel, and we've never failed to post three serial updates a week. We are reliable. The story <em>will</em> be finished on time. It is projected to run between 50 and 60 chapters, and should be between 125,000 and 150,000 words.</p>
<ul>
<li>Memberships to Adventurotica will be available for use immediately, meaning you can follow along there, three times a week, until the story ends.</li>
<li>If you've bought yourself any sort of walk-on role or bonus scene, that will obviously come out <em>with</em> the ebook.</li>
<li>The ebook won't come out until after the book has been published in serial form on Adventurotica.com, which should wrap up in February. You'll be able to read it at Adventurotica the entire time.</li>
<li>Print books will be released at the same time as the ebook.</li>
<li>Production of material incentives like prints and bookmarks and so forth will begin after the campaign ends, but this bit is not anticipated to take terribly long.</li>
</ul><p>If we don't make goal, we'll still be able to provide the perks for everyone who did donate, and we'll do the best we can on what we get.</p>
<h2>THE IMPACT:</h2>
<p>This is the part where we're supposed to explain how our project is valuable to you and to the world. No pressure. I'd love to claim that our project will bring about world peace by making sure nobody has a hand free to pull a trigger, but that seems unlikely.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>What we can do is make people happy.</strong> Have a good time. Bring something that is unreservedly fun into the world, just because it belongs here.</li>
<li>
<strong>Erotica is an important genre, and we want to make it a better, more entertaining place.</strong> Bottom line, people often complain, with good reason, that good erotica is difficult to find. That most of it is poorly-written. That the characters are flat. That the sex is boring. That it doesn't tell an interesting story.</li>
<li>
<strong>We want to give readers <em>entertainment for adults</em>, not just adult entertainment.</strong> There is a dire shortage of well-written, fast-paced, plot-heavy long-form erotica. We want to write a book that provides you, the reader, with a well-told adventure story that doesn't fade to black just when things are getting good.</li>
<li>
<strong>We want to encourage independent erotica publishing by being part of it.</strong> By publishing independently, we are freeing ourselves from the restrictions placed on authors by publishers; restrictions on content, on length, on ratio of plot to sex. We aren't breaking rules. We're stepping outside of them. We're doing our own thing, our way. And you can help!</li>
</ul><h2>HOW YOU CAN HELP:</h2>
<p><strong>Boost the signal!</strong> If you can't contribute, that's fine.  You can still tell everyone about us.</p>
<p>There are share tools right here on Indiegogo!  Also, we are assuming you have some social network stuff going on, so spreading the word that way would be super-awesome of you.</p>
<p>We're sure you have friends who would appreciate some swashbuckling smuttery, so, really, you'll be doing them a service sending them our way.</p>
<p>We sincerely appreciate those who support us by helping to spread the word. Y'all do a lot of good, and we cannot thank you enough.</p></div>","FAQ #3: Anonymity!
We've had a few people ask, so we'd like to clarify, the having your name listed with the contributors is totally optional. You will have the chance to choose if and how your name appears!
FAQ #2: Let's look at some art!
Amanda Gannon is half of our team, and in addition to barking at strangers and talking to imaginary people, one of her hobbies is making art. Most of it is pretty cool.
She started on the art for the incentive prints today, and should have it done by the end of the campaign. That's not soon enough to give y'all an idea of what it will look like, though, so we're giving you a look behind the scenes.
She's taking some very pretty but very small ink drawings she did a while back and is enlarging and improving them.  These are the originals she's working from:

You can have prints of the final versions (again, not these, but super-incredibly-close), plus ebook, website membership for the duration of the serial, and listing with the contributors.
And someone, one lucky someone, will get the originals, which are 9x12, done in archival ink on vellum Bristol board.
FAQ #1: Let's talk about sex scenes.
Holy wow, we are 30% funded in three days! Please keep spreading that word!
Today, I thought we should share details about the bonus scene perk with prospective backers.
If you are brave and awesome enough to take this perk, you will get a sex scene of at least 3,000 words. It will be published in the book for everyone to enjoy, but unless the backer requests a dedication, their name will not be connected with it. You can choose two or three characters (more than that is a logistical nightmare both in reality and in fiction) and we will sex 'em up. It doesn't have to be a canonical mix, and we do not care one rodential posterior about orientation. Three guys? We can do that. It's all good.If you want a specific something included, we'll do our best to accommodate that (within reason; ""three weasels, some peanut butter, and a ping-pong-ball gun"" would obviously be over the line, although we might ask you to visit next time you come to town).
If you want a specific something NOT included, we can do that.All attempts at gratifying kinks will be met with our best effort, and limits are pretty soft. We're open to negotiation on anything except for kids/pooping/barfing/serious bodily harm.Backers will have the option - and it is totally optional - to make up a list of up to ten things that they really, really like. It's conceivable that this might embarrass some people terrifically, but we assure you, whatever you are into, we have probably written worse for ourselves.

OH MY GOD, WHO ARE YOU PEOPLE?

We have an unlimited special effects budget and absolutely no limits on what our actors will and will not do, and we abuse these advantages shamelessly.
WHAT WE NEED:
Money. (No point in beating around the bush.)
Here is how we will spend it:


A really cool cover. We'd like to pay someone to do this for us so our cover is not as awesomely bad as the trailer.

Materials for the incentives. All that fun stuff has to come from somewhere!

Living expenses. Food, bills, and a roof to turn away the life-leeching rays of the blazing hatestar – sorry, the sun. We have this annoying hierarchy of needs thing going on. Damn you, Maslow!


Medical care. Writing all these naughty words can be dangerous, you know. Paper cuts, repetitive stress injuries, tragic Hitachi accidents . . . it's a brutal line of work. (Have you ever tried to get lube out of a keyboard?) No, seriously, some of us need to be medicated for the public good.
And there you have it. Most of it is going towards keeping us alive. Is that exciting? No! But we have to stay alive to write smut. Contrary to what you might think, zombies don't write very interesting sex scenes. It's just a lot of moaning and cannibalism.

<h3>What's this all about anyway?</h3>
<p>I'm a science fiction fan. I am also a big science buff though, so I can't help but notice inconsistencies or errors in Sci-Fi when it comes to the science involved.</p>
<p>In my studies of robotics, and evolution, I came to a realization that basically no one had gotten Artificial Intelligence correct.</p>
<p>The way it's depicted in most outlets is something along the lines of a super computer, or a network of computers that is super smart and somehow becomes self aware (usually looking to then take over the planet).</p>
<p>I argue that this could not be the case though for a truly LIVING inorganic sentience.</p>
<p>All living, intelligent things develop. They start in a womb, or an amniotic egg, where their senses begin doing some work, and gradually more and more information come in to the brain, sometimes, as in the case of humans, for decades before they are generally considered 'mature'. They learn. Society, and sociology is key in how anything develops.</p>
<p>There have been a few instances of this, and I would not claim my idea is 100% origional, but it is surely not the path normally taken.</p>
<p>HAL, the super computer of 2001: A Space Odyssey for instance, listed as one of the top 10 movie villains of all time, and regarded as a fan favorite of Artificial Intelligence, is in fact only a computer running a program. The Robots in iRobot as well, are nothing more than systems following code.</p>
<p>I look to move beyond that, in to Synthetic Intelligence.</p>
<p>When I first figured out the science behind how it would happen, I then set to put that in a setting and tell the story.</p>
<p>Omega Children is part 1 of that story, and I have had an absolute blast writing it.</p>
<p>Much of the book follows the creation and development of the things themselves, the Omegas- while later we deal with the repercussions of our creations.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The following in an excerpt from Chapter 5.</p>
<p><em>Lucas</em> who they are speaking of, is the lab's governing computer system.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p class=""Standard"" style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Everyone began talking and hurriedly flicking through read outs and results, scanning if they may have missed something from the past few hours.</p>

</p></div>","What's this all about anyway?
I'm a science fiction fan. I am also a big science buff though, so I can't help but notice inconsistencies or errors in Sci-Fi when it comes to the science involved.
In my studies of robotics, and evolution, I came to a realization that basically no one had gotten Artificial Intelligence correct.
The way it's depicted in most outlets is something along the lines of a super computer, or a network of computers that is super smart and somehow becomes self aware (usually looking to then take over the planet).
I argue that this could not be the case though for a truly LIVING inorganic sentience.
All living, intelligent things develop. They start in a womb, or an amniotic egg, where their senses begin doing some work, and gradually more and more information come in to the brain, sometimes, as in the case of humans, for decades before they are generally considered 'mature'. They learn. Society, and sociology is key in how anything develops.
There have been a few instances of this, and I would not claim my idea is 100% origional, but it is surely not the path normally taken.
HAL, the super computer of 2001: A Space Odyssey for instance, listed as one of the top 10 movie villains of all time, and regarded as a fan favorite of Artificial Intelligence, is in fact only a computer running a program. The Robots in iRobot as well, are nothing more than systems following code.
I look to move beyond that, in to Synthetic Intelligence.
When I first figured out the science behind how it would happen, I then set to put that in a setting and tell the story.
Omega Children is part 1 of that story, and I have had an absolute blast writing it.
Much of the book follows the creation and development of the things themselves, the Omegas- while later we deal with the repercussions of our creations.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following in an excerpt from Chapter 5.
Lucas who they are speaking of, is the lab's governing computer system.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Everyone began talking and hurriedly flicking through read outs and results, scanning if they may have missed something from the past few hours.
Doctor Kowles was instantly in his command window diving in to the diagnostics of his system.
Alison had assumed that everyone would go home then since Lucas had basically shelved the entire operation for the night, but in reality the opposite happened.
The whole team hunkered down in to crisis mode to get a full understanding of the situation.
“Lucas is like… a mother who just had a difficult birth.” Alison observed.
“Clever analogy.” Doctor Kowles responded as he drew a diagram on his BluScroll.
“It’s not just an analogy, it’s remarkably similar Randall,” she pressed “he is giving pieces of himself to create another- he is going through pain and torment and depleting his own resources so the Omegas can live.”
“He doesn’t feel pain or torment.”
“It sure appeared that way!” she replied.
“That’s because he’s supposed to appear that way, that's his programming.” He snapped, unusually short with her.
Alison noticed the hint, but ignored it, “then why would he change the schedule?”
Doctor Kowles was visibly aggravated that she wasn’t leaving him alone, but showed remarkable poise in answering the question, “The underlying problem is real. A system needs a certain amount of things to work properly. It needs the right power, the right throughput, the right temperature, the right formatting, a bunch of things. Lucas saw something in the Omegas that wasn’t right and maneuvered to correct the problem. That’s what he’s supposed to do.”
“So he is protecting them?”
“I mean yes he is protecting them, but not out of maternal or paternal instinct. We’ve given him the task of getting the Omegas from initial activation through their early infancy so he is just following our commands.”
She continued, “and what about him?”
“He observed he was beginning to slow down or fail at some process his security algorithms deemed critical to completing his main task of rearing the Omegas, so he’s addressing that problem.”
That made sense to Alison, but there was still that lingering nag that something wasn’t right.
“So, why are you and everyone else going crazy?” she asked.
Doctor Kowles gnawed on his bottom lip some and then released it with a large exhale.
“What is going on Randall?”
“Lucas is purposely not involving us in his diagnosis,” he began “I mean, I’m in, I’m looking at him and I can do things, but it’s like he doesn’t want me to. He’s never said he will fix himself before and then shut down. He is supposed to unlock so the engineers can help fix him. It’s like, a patient not letting a doctor work.”
“He’s not letting you help? Can he do that?”
“He never could before or at least never tried it.” Doctor Kowles answered.

He didn’t answer.
“Fick Randall, are you telling me he is taking this to an extreme and actually protecting them from us?”

desarrolla en el departamento de Estelí, al noroeste del país, donde la
enfermedad mental condena a muchas personas a vivir el resto de sus vidas
encerradas sin tratamiento adecuado, relegándolas a un aislamiento deshumanizante

<p>Nicaragua es un país de América Central, con una extensión
de 130.682 Km<sup>2</sup> y una población de 5.4 millones de habitantes, de los
que la mayoría viven en la capital, Managua.</p>
<p>Ha sufrido numerosas catástrofes naturales, ha sobrevivido a
una guerra y ha padecido grandes oscilaciones políticas que han impedido su
mayor desarrollo económico y social. Actualmente, es el país más pobre de
América Latina después de Haití. El 48.3% de la población vive bajo el umbral
de la pobreza y el 17 % en lo que se considera pobreza extrema que se
multiplica por tres en contextos rurales.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432634078/xeqboqlzsn4eg55b6m78.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Situado en el noroeste del país y con una población de

la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos nicaragüenses mediante la promoción y
protección de su salud general, la salud mental permanece aún muy desatendida.</p>
<p><b>Salud mental en
Nicaragua</b></p>
<p>No existe a nivel nacional una red estructurada de salud
mental y se carece, por el momento, de un Plan Nacional de Salud Mental. Existen,
por tanto, grandes necesidades de atención en Salud Mental. Como ejemplo, todo el
departamento de Estelí cuenta con solo 1 médico psiquiatra del Ministerio de
Salud, cuando en España, para esa misma población, contaríamos con 12.</p>

un objetivo principal: la promoción del trato humano y del tratamiento adecuado
a los pacientes más aislados o encerrados.</p>
<p><b>¿En qué situación están
las personas encerradas? </b></p>
<p>Partiendo de los datos de que se dispone actualmente,
calculamos que en todo el Departamento de Estelí podrá haber en situación de
encierro o gran aislamiento hasta la quinta parte de los pacientes con
trastorno mental grave. Es decir, si hasta la fecha y a falta de completar el
registro en dos de los municipios, se han registrado más de 300 casos,
calculamos que podrán estar viviendo en situación de encierro un mínimo de 50
personas.</p>
<p>Las personas con enfermedad mental son encerradas por
episodios de mucha agitación fruto de descompensación psicopatológica o de los
efectos adversos de la medicación.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432628563/dbl9vsgmo9lyzlkvupbw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 629.007px; height: 419px;""/></p>Algunos pacientes están sin tratamiento de ningún tipo: ni
farmacológico ni <p>psicosocial, y los que toman alguna medicación lo hacen con
escaso seguimiento de su respuesta a la misma, padeciendo importantes efectos
adversos.

</p><p>Todos los pacientes en esta situación se encuentran
psicopatológicamente descompensados, con sintomatología positiva muy activa (alucinaciones
y delirios) y casi nulo contacto con la realidad.</p>
<p>Dependiendo del tiempo que lleven en situación de encierro,
se encuentran más o menos deteriorados, pero en general hay una pérdida de la
autonomía en casi todas las áreas.</p>
<p>Especialmente carecen de capacidad para relacionarse con
otras personas, siendo casi imposible mantener algún contacto personal.</p>
<p>Las condiciones higiénicas de los lugares de encierro son
muy insalubres. En muchos de los casos, no cuentan con un WC,
un simple colchón o una ventana.</p>
<p>Cuando se encierra a la persona al inicio de los problemas o
cuando estos se repiten, surge un acostumbramiento a la situación y esta se normaliza
y acepta en la familia.</p>
<p><b>¿Quiénes son las
Brigadistas de Salud? </b></p>
<p>Las brigadistas de salud son personas de la propia
comunidad, principalmente mujeres, que se encargan de manera voluntaria de
conocer, seguir y supervisar el estado de salud de sus vecinos en la comunidad.
Participan de manera muy activa en el terreno, realizando diversas campañas de
prevención y detección, y lo hacen con una estrecha colaboración entre el
personal sanitario de atención primaria.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432628621/dzpizlmvwi2hyuzh1rek.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 607.654px; height: 456px;""/></p>En general se muestran muy motivadas para realizar trabajos
comunitarios y son personas relevantes dentro de sus comunidades. En todo el
departamento de Estelí se estima que existen 480 comunidades y, en cada
comunidad, el número de brigadistas varía de una a tres. Y a todas ellas quiere
llegar nuestro Programa. A día de hoy ya hemos incorporado a la causa de la salud
mental a 401 brigadistas.<br/><br/><p><b>Un balance hasta la
fecha de hoy </b></p>
<p>Hace casi tres años que esta iniciativa surgió con una
mochila y una libreta cruzando calles de Madrid y de Estelí. Hoy, podemos
afirmar que esta idea tiene sentido, marco, estructura y forma, que creemos en
nuestra apuesta.</p>
<p>El proyecto surge a partir de la ilusión, esfuerzo y
coordinación de organizaciones e instituciones que apuestan por una
intervención en Salud Mental desde la comunidad, luchando por la integración,
respeto y dignidad de las personas que conviven con algún trastorno mental
grave.</p>
<p>Nicaragua, país de lagos y volcanes, ha sido el marco en el
que se han desarrollado las diferentes líneas de acción. Bajo el paraguas del
Ministerio de Salud Nicaragüense, de la mano de la Fundación Manantial y el
Grupo de Acción Comunitaria, se trabaja con el objetivo de mejorar la atención
de las personas con trastorno mental grave en el departamento de Estelí.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432628733/h48qssyjdycjxuqhvqrm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Podemos hablar de resultados, necesidades y potencialidades,
pero sabemos que queda mucho por hacer. Después de tres años de esfuerzo y
aprendizajes, en las calles y casas de las comunidades ya se habla de salud
mental. Los centros de salud exponen murales psicoeducativos, los encierros y
aislamientos son detectados, señalados, juzgados y abordados en coordinación
con diferentes instituciones,... y existe un registro que permite conocer qué
personas tienen algún trastorno mental. Historias clínicas y planes de atención
aseguran un seguimiento por parte de los profesionales.<br/><br/><p>Los equipos de atención primaria, las personas brigadistas
de salud o líderes comunitarias se sienten “empoderadas” y formadas,
intervienen en la detección y seguimiento, forman parte indispensable del
abordaje psicosocial que requiere cada caso. Tenemos materiales que nos
permiten recordar todo lo que hemos aprendido en los talleres de capacitación y
difundirlo en las familias, las comunidades y los centros de salud.</p>
<p>La idea es defender la Salud mental como un
derecho universal. El respeto a las personas con algún trastorno mental y su
identidad, la lucha por un tratamiento adecuado y un trato digno. La búsqueda
de la rehabilitación, la integración y la autonomía de todas estas personas. La
constante denuncia a cualquier vulneración de derechos y aislamiento.</p>
<p>Creemos en una salud mental comunitaria y sabemos que es
posible en Estelí.</p>
<p>Gracias a nuestro recorrido, tenemos claras las necesidades
y las líneas de acción, ahora necesitamos sumar esfuerzos para poder llegar a
todas las casas, para poder formar en todas las comunidades, para poder
acompañar a todas las familias y con esto, lograr una atención integral e
igualitaria para todas las personas con trastorno mental grave de Estelí.</p><p><b>¿A qué se destinará el dinero recaudado?</b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433927273/meuc5eb0nbbphmezqhas.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b></b></p><p><b><i>Aunque nuestro objetivo es muy ambicioso, hemos decidido centrar la meta en la capacitación de profesionales y la sensibilización de las familias para poder seguir sacando a estas personas de su encierro y tratándolas en la comunidad, para lo que necesitaríamos 4.000€.</i></b></p>Si no puedes ayudar económicamente, por favor difunde nuestro proyecto.

<p>The Project
‘Improving Mental health in Nicaragua’ is located at the Estelí Department, in Northern Nicaragua, where people with serious mental disorder are locked
up without an appropriate medical treatment, isolated in inhumane conditions
that aggravate their illness. </p>
<p>We need your help to free these
people. Your cooperation will open so many doors! </p>
<p><b><u>Present situation in Estelí (Nicaragua)</u></b></p>
<p>Nicaragua is a country in Central
America, with an extension of 130,682 sq. km., and it has a population of 5.4
million, most of whom are living in the capital, Managua.</p>
<p>Over the last few decades Nicaragua has suffered from a number of
natural disasters, has survived a war and has also suffered wide swings in
politics that have impeded further economic and social development. Nowadays,
it is the poorest country of Latin America after Haiti. Over 48% of the
population lives under the poverty threshold and 17% in extreme poverty. This
increases by a factor of three in rural contexts. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432628777/dz6scjs2sliq0jwit2ib.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 598.864px; height: 510px;""/></p>The Estelí Department, in Northern Nicaragua, has approximately 225,000
inhabitants and there is where we’re going to develop our project.

<p>In such a context, the current Government has assigned top priority to
improve the quality of life of Nicaragua citizens promoting and protecting
general health and human rights. So that mental health cannot be properly met.</p>
<p><b><u>Mental health in Nicaragua</u></b></p>
<p>At national level a structured mental health network does not yet exist
and, for the time being, there is no a National Mental Health Care Plan
providing general guidelines. The single point of reference is a National
Programme dated 2003 that was never implemented. As an example of the acute
mental health-care needs, we can mention that the Estelí Department has 1
public psychiatrist when Spain would have 12 for this population.</p>
<p>The request for technical assistance and support in terms of human
resources in order to strengthen the network of care for persons with serious
mental disorders from the Directory of Health Care in Nicaraguan Ministry of
Health (MINSA), determined to end with this situation, lies within this
framework of great needs and as a commitment of the Public Health to structure
an inclusive mental health-care system human-rights based.</p>
<p>Our work plan for the Strengthening of the Mental Health Network in the
Department of Estelí has a main objective: promoting humane treatment and
appropriate care to the most isolate or locked up patients.</p>
<p><b><u>What is the situation of the locked up persons?</u></b></p>
<p>From the data currently available, we estimate that in the Department of
Estelí one fifth of the patients with serious mental disorder could be locked
up. In other words, up to now and in the absence of completing the records of 2
municipalities (more than 300 cases have already been registered) we estimate
that a minimum of 50 persons are locked up or very isolated.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432628855/yrfzbpgjn2sakl5ibx2k.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The main reason why they are locked up is because
     they suffer much upheaval episodes as a result of psychopathological unbalance
     (hallucinations and delirium) or because of the adverse impacts of
     medication given without any specialized supervision.<ul>
<li>Many patients are lacking access to both
     pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. Those taking medication do it
     without any follow up on their response and suffering significant adverse
     effects.</li>
<li>All the patients in this situation are psycho
     pathologically unbalanced. They sometimes hear voices that are not there
     and have “visions” out of touch with the reality.</li>
<li>Depending upon the time they are locked up, they
     are more or less damaged but, in general, there is a loss of autonomy in
     almost all the areas.</li>
<li>They particularly lack the capacity to relate to
     other people. It is almost impossible to keep a personal link with them.</li>

Nicaragua
Proyecto de  Fundación Manantial y Grupo de Acción Comunitaria
El proyecto ‘Mejorando la Salud Mental en Nicaragua’ se
desarrolla en el departamento de Estelí, al noroeste del país, donde la
enfermedad mental condena a muchas personas a vivir el resto de sus vidas
encerradas sin tratamiento adecuado, relegándolas a un aislamiento deshumanizante
que produce el agravamiento de su enfermedad.
Para que estas personas puedan salir de ese aislamiento, necesitamos
tu ayuda. ¡Tu colaboración puede abrir muchas puertas!¿Por qué Nicaragua?
Nicaragua es un país de América Central, con una extensión
de 130.682 Km2 y una población de 5.4 millones de habitantes, de los
que la mayoría viven en la capital, Managua.
Ha sufrido numerosas catástrofes naturales, ha sobrevivido a
una guerra y ha padecido grandes oscilaciones políticas que han impedido su
mayor desarrollo económico y social. Actualmente, es el país más pobre de
América Latina después de Haití. El 48.3% de la población vive bajo el umbral
de la pobreza y el 17 % en lo que se considera pobreza extrema que se
multiplica por tres en contextos rurales.Situado en el noroeste del país y con una población de
225.000 habitantes, aproximadamente, el departamento de Estelí es el lugar
donde vamos a llevar a cabo nuestro proyecto.A pesar de que la prioridad del gobierno actual es mejorar
la calidad de vida de los ciudadanos nicaragüenses mediante la promoción y
protección de su salud general, la salud mental permanece aún muy desatendida.
Salud mental en
Nicaragua
No existe a nivel nacional una red estructurada de salud
mental y se carece, por el momento, de un Plan Nacional de Salud Mental. Existen,
por tanto, grandes necesidades de atención en Salud Mental. Como ejemplo, todo el
departamento de Estelí cuenta con solo 1 médico psiquiatra del Ministerio de
Salud, cuando en España, para esa misma población, contaríamos con 12.
​La Dirección Departamental de Salud del Ministerio de Salud de Nicaragua (MINSA), ​está decidida a acabar con esta situación y a fortalecer la red de atención a los pacientes con Trastorno Mental Grave como una apuesta de la sanidad pública por estructurar un sistema de atención en salud mental inclusivo y basado en el respeto de los derechos humanos.
Nuestro plan de trabajo en el departamento de Estelí tiene
un objetivo principal: la promoción del trato humano y del tratamiento adecuado
a los pacientes más aislados o encerrados.
¿En qué situación están
las personas encerradas? 
Partiendo de los datos de que se dispone actualmente,
calculamos que en todo el Departamento de Estelí podrá haber en situación de
encierro o gran aislamiento hasta la quinta parte de los pacientes con
trastorno mental grave. Es decir, si hasta la fecha y a falta de completar el
registro en dos de los municipios, se han registrado más de 300 casos,
calculamos que podrán estar viviendo en situación de encierro un mínimo de 50
personas.
Las personas con enfermedad mental son encerradas por
episodios de mucha agitación fruto de descompensación psicopatológica o de los
efectos adversos de la medicación.
Algunos pacientes están sin tratamiento de ningún tipo: ni
farmacológico ni psicosocial, y los que toman alguna medicación lo hacen con
escaso seguimiento de su respuesta a la misma, padeciendo importantes efectos
adversos.

Todos los pacientes en esta situación se encuentran
psicopatológicamente descompensados, con sintomatología positiva muy activa (alucinaciones
y delirios) y casi nulo contacto con la realidad.
Dependiendo del tiempo que lleven en situación de encierro,
se encuentran más o menos deteriorados, pero en general hay una pérdida de la
autonomía en casi todas las áreas.
Especialmente carecen de capacidad para relacionarse con
otras personas, siendo casi imposible mantener algún contacto personal.
Las condiciones higiénicas de los lugares de encierro son
muy insalubres. En muchos de los casos, no cuentan con un WC,
un simple colchón o una ventana.
Cuando se encierra a la persona al inicio de los problemas o
cuando estos se repiten, surge un acostumbramiento a la situación y esta se normaliza
y acepta en la familia.
¿Quiénes son las
Brigadistas de Salud? 
Las brigadistas de salud son personas de la propia
comunidad, principalmente mujeres, que se encargan de manera voluntaria de
conocer, seguir y supervisar el estado de salud de sus vecinos en la comunidad.
Participan de manera muy activa en el terreno, realizando diversas campañas de
prevención y detección, y lo hacen con una estrecha colaboración entre el
personal sanitario de atención primaria.En general se muestran muy motivadas para realizar trabajos
comunitarios y son personas relevantes dentro de sus comunidades. En todo el
departamento de Estelí se estima que existen 480 comunidades y, en cada
comunidad, el número de brigadistas varía de una a tres. Y a todas ellas quiere
llegar nuestro Programa. A día de hoy ya hemos incorporado a la causa de la salud
mental a 401 brigadistas.Un balance hasta la
fecha de hoy 
Hace casi tres años que esta iniciativa surgió con una
mochila y una libreta cruzando calles de Madrid y de Estelí. Hoy, podemos
afirmar que esta idea tiene sentido, marco, estructura y forma, que creemos en
nuestra apuesta.
El proyecto surge a partir de la ilusión, esfuerzo y
coordinación de organizaciones e instituciones que apuestan por una
intervención en Salud Mental desde la comunidad, luchando por la integración,
respeto y dignidad de las personas que conviven con algún trastorno mental
grave.
Nicaragua, país de lagos y volcanes, ha sido el marco en el
que se han desarrollado las diferentes líneas de acción. Bajo el paraguas del
Ministerio de Salud Nicaragüense, de la mano de la Fundación Manantial y el
Grupo de Acción Comunitaria, se trabaja con el objetivo de mejorar la atención
de las personas con trastorno mental grave en el departamento de Estelí.Podemos hablar de resultados, necesidades y potencialidades,
pero sabemos que queda mucho por hacer. Después de tres años de esfuerzo y
aprendizajes, en las calles y casas de las comunidades ya se habla de salud
mental. Los centros de salud exponen murales psicoeducativos, los encierros y
aislamientos son detectados, señalados, juzgados y abordados en coordinación
con diferentes instituciones,... y existe un registro que permite conocer qué
personas tienen algún trastorno mental. Historias clínicas y planes de atención
aseguran un seguimiento por parte de los profesionales.Los equipos de atención primaria, las personas brigadistas
de salud o líderes comunitarias se sienten “empoderadas” y formadas,
intervienen en la detección y seguimiento, forman parte indispensable del
abordaje psicosocial que requiere cada caso. Tenemos materiales que nos
permiten recordar todo lo que hemos aprendido en los talleres de capacitación y
difundirlo en las familias, las comunidades y los centros de salud.
La idea es defender la Salud mental como un
derecho universal. El respeto a las personas con algún trastorno mental y su
identidad, la lucha por un tratamiento adecuado y un trato digno. La búsqueda
de la rehabilitación, la integración y la autonomía de todas estas personas. La
constante denuncia a cualquier vulneración de derechos y aislamiento.
Creemos en una salud mental comunitaria y sabemos que es
posible en Estelí.
Gracias a nuestro recorrido, tenemos claras las necesidades
y las líneas de acción, ahora necesitamos sumar esfuerzos para poder llegar a
todas las casas, para poder formar en todas las comunidades, para poder
acompañar a todas las familias y con esto, lograr una atención integral e
igualitaria para todas las personas con trastorno mental grave de Estelí.¿A qué se destinará el dinero recaudado?Aunque nuestro objetivo es muy ambicioso, hemos decidido centrar la meta en la capacitación de profesionales y la sensibilización de las familias para poder seguir sacando a estas personas de su encierro y tratándolas en la comunidad, para lo que necesitaríamos 4.000€.Si no puedes ayudar económicamente, por favor difunde nuestro proyecto.
Si le damos visibilidad, podremos mejorar la salud mental en Nicaragua.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Improving Mental health in Nicaragua
A Project by Fundación Manantial and Grupo de
Acción Comunitaria
The Project
‘Improving Mental health in Nicaragua’ is located at the Estelí Department, in Northern Nicaragua, where people with serious mental disorder are locked
up without an appropriate medical treatment, isolated in inhumane conditions
that aggravate their illness. 
We need your help to free these
people. Your cooperation will open so many doors! 
Present situation in Estelí (Nicaragua)
Nicaragua is a country in Central
America, with an extension of 130,682 sq. km., and it has a population of 5.4
million, most of whom are living in the capital, Managua.
Over the last few decades Nicaragua has suffered from a number of
natural disasters, has survived a war and has also suffered wide swings in
politics that have impeded further economic and social development. Nowadays,
it is the poorest country of Latin America after Haiti. Over 48% of the
population lives under the poverty threshold and 17% in extreme poverty. This
increases by a factor of three in rural contexts. The Estelí Department, in Northern Nicaragua, has approximately 225,000
inhabitants and there is where we’re going to develop our project.

In such a context, the current Government has assigned top priority to
improve the quality of life of Nicaragua citizens promoting and protecting
general health and human rights. So that mental health cannot be properly met.
Mental health in Nicaragua
At national level a structured mental health network does not yet exist
and, for the time being, there is no a National Mental Health Care Plan
providing general guidelines. The single point of reference is a National
Programme dated 2003 that was never implemented. As an example of the acute
mental health-care needs, we can mention that the Estelí Department has 1
public psychiatrist when Spain would have 12 for this population.
The request for technical assistance and support in terms of human
resources in order to strengthen the network of care for persons with serious
mental disorders from the Directory of Health Care in Nicaraguan Ministry of
Health (MINSA), determined to end with this situation, lies within this
framework of great needs and as a commitment of the Public Health to structure
an inclusive mental health-care system human-rights based.
Our work plan for the Strengthening of the Mental Health Network in the
Department of Estelí has a main objective: promoting humane treatment and
appropriate care to the most isolate or locked up patients.
What is the situation of the locked up persons?
From the data currently available, we estimate that in the Department of
Estelí one fifth of the patients with serious mental disorder could be locked
up. In other words, up to now and in the absence of completing the records of 2
municipalities (more than 300 cases have already been registered) we estimate
that a minimum of 50 persons are locked up or very isolated.The main reason why they are locked up is because
     they suffer much upheaval episodes as a result of psychopathological unbalance
     (hallucinations and delirium) or because of the adverse impacts of
     medication given without any specialized supervision.
Many patients are lacking access to both
     pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. Those taking medication do it
     without any follow up on their response and suffering significant adverse
     effects.
All the patients in this situation are psycho
     pathologically unbalanced. They sometimes hear voices that are not there
     and have “visions” out of touch with the reality.
Depending upon the time they are locked up, they
     are more or less damaged but, in general, there is a loss of autonomy in
     almost all the areas.
They particularly lack the capacity to relate to
     other people. It is almost impossible to keep a personal link with them.
The hygiene conditions of their place of
     confinement are very unhealthy. In many cases, they do not have even a
     toilet, a mattress or a window.
Once the person has been locked up, when the
     problems began or when they repeat, there is a routinisation and the
     situation is normalizing and accepted by the family.

One of the strategies of our plan consists in raising awareness and
training a very special group of persons in Nicaragua: the female health
brigades.
Who are the Female Health Brigades?
They are persons from the community itself, mainly women, who
voluntarily are responsible for knowing, following up and overseeing the health
of their neighbors. They are actively involved in the field by carrying out
prevention and detection campaigns in close cooperation with the primary health
care staff.In general, they are highly motivated to work within the community or
the villages they live in. They are also prominent persons within their
communities. There are an estimated 480 communities over all the Department of
Estelí. In each community the number of brigades varies (3 to 1). Our programme
wants to reach all of them. To this day, we have already incorporated 401
female brigades to the mental health cause.The balance to date
It is nearly three years since this initiative arose with a backpack and
a notebook, throughout the streets of Madrid and Estelí. Today, we can affirm
that this idea makes sense, within a framework, it has a structure and a shape
and we believe in our commitment. 
The project arises from the illusion, the efforts and coordination of

This month, from CLOSER THAN WE KNOW'S proceeds, I will only be sending a check of $25 to The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention because the sales have been struggling (despite having over 1,200 reads and FANTASTIC reviews!) The problem, that I've heard from my supporters, is that they don't have a Kindle or nook or would rather read an actual book!
By donating, won't just be helping ME, you'll be contributing to charities in the long run and supporting my writing!  Thank you so much and God bless!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""""><font color=""#000000"" size=""3"">Hi everyone. Hopefully everyone of you reading this
already know me but if you don't my name is Sarah Teegarden and last year I was
blessed with the chance to go to Dufailly, Haiti on a mission trip. I had never
been to Haiti before so I was more than excited to go there. Little did I know
that before I would leave I would fall in love with country and the people.
I've always loved going on overseas mission trips. It's something that has been
placed on my heart and I gladly accept the calling. I love to help with mission
organizations locally too, but I feel like at least once a year I should be
going to other places and sharing God's love! My church and I go with an
organization called Teen Mission USA. The group has been going to this village
for some time now and has been able to set up a school for free education in
the village. In order to obtain any type of education in Haiti, most people
have to pay to attend schools. For many, this is not an option considering the
income they have. Most of the families struggle to even provide food so an
education was out of the question. Teen Mission built the school and offers
free education except paying for books which is a minimal cost. Yvrose Johnson,
the leader of the mission and school, wanted the people to feel like they were
contributing somewhat because that makes them really take ownership in the
project. The school had over 110 children last year in a small building and
this year has over 200! We started work on another building last year and hope
to be able to completely finish it when we return in February.</font></p>

until I went there last year. I saw mother's fighting for extra food for their
families just to survive. This is another goal. , to bring more food for the

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any journalism project nowadays, maintaining a healthy print and digital publication — especially one with limited advertising! — is challenging.

In the “80s, he chased a girl to the Merrimack Valley, married her, raised a family and started a business. He recently celebrated 30 years of marriage to the aforementioned girl. When he’s not doing publisher things, he can be found sipping a good single malt scotch and puffing on a fine cigar — on a nice Floridian or Caribbean beach whenever possible. He holds a bachelor’s degree from Long Island University and a master’s degree from Boston University.
Managing EditorDoug Sparks is an editor and writer living with his wife, child and chihuahua in the greater Lowell area of Massachusetts. A lover of tea, music and poetry, he is a former coffee roaster. Aside from editing and writing, he has taught English literature and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, driven a delivery truck, lived on a goat farm and worked as a bouncer at an underground New York City club. He holds a bachelor’s degree from Goddard College and a master’s degree from New York University. He is a pretty good cook and prefers a cleaver to a chef’s knife. With a cleaver, it’s much easier to mince ginger.
Travel & Culture EditorEmilie-Noelle Provost is a writer, editor and author who lives in northeastern Massachusetts with her husband, daughter and four crazy rescue cats. She loves wine, books, traveling and hiking, and is hopelessly addicted to European crime dramas. She began her career as a professional writer working in the travel and hospitality industry, and writing about interesting places is still one of her favorite things to do. Emilie-Noelle has published several pieces of short fiction and is the author of “The Blue Bottle,” a middle-grade adventure novel published in summer 2018. You can see what she’s up to at emilienoelleprovost.com.
Creative DirectorStephen Pennimpede is a creative machine … a workhorse … and quite possibly the most organized artist you will ever meet. If the building is on fire, he’s the one that will finish whatever he’s doing, shutdown the computer, pack it up and let the firemen in on his way out the door. He graduated from Tufts University with two degrees while working full-time (because one degree would have been too easy). He’s been using Photoshop since it was created, loves the clean design aesthetic of Japanese masters and dreams in CMYK color palettes. His wife insists he’s a combination of both Leonard and Sheldon, even though he was a geek long before “Big Bang Theory” made that cool.
Digital EditorJoe Girard-Meli is an editor and writer living with his husband and two cats in downtown Lowell, Massachusetts. A lifelong video game fan, he dreams of publishing his own game someday. He can often be found poring over the game script at one of the area’s many independent cafés, a cup of herbal tea in his hand. Joe’s especially interested in the way a master’s craft – whether that’s game writing, journalism or coffee brewing – can be used to make the world a better place. With so many stories vying for attention in The Bean Magazine, he seeks to amplify the voices that aren’t heard often enough. He holds a bachelor’s degree in journalism from UMass Amherst and is a graduate student studying communication at Southern New Hampshire University.

We've Done This Before, and We'll Do It Again
The team at 512 Media Inc., led by publisher Glenn Prezzano, has been publishing regionally in New England for over a decade now — no small feat considering the challenging environment for journalism nowadays. We're confident that we're ready to take our DIY, smaller-is-better mindset to a wider audience with an appetite for independently-created content on the cafe culture that binds us all together (whether we've got a cup of coffee, tea or something else in our hands).

Risks & Challenges
As with any journalism project nowadays, maintaining a healthy print and digital publication — especially one with limited advertising! — is challenging. We need readers who are willing to part with their hard-earned cash to keep us writing, creating and publishing... but if you've read this far, we know you're one of our people, and there are enough of us out there to make this thing work in a major way!
Outside the U.S.?
Email us at publisher (at) thebeanmagazine.com. We'll make it work.

If you just spent the last of your change on a cuppa to get you through the work or school day, don't worry — we get it. You can help us spread the word about The Bean Magazine by using the sharing tools on this page, or just with good old-fashioned word-of-mouth with your pals at the local tea room.

<h3>Marriage of Honor - The Book<br/>
</h3>
<p>My name is Richard Quinonez, and I am the founder of marriageofhonor.com                  I have been married to Rosemary for more almost twenty eight years. We have been involved in ministry as group leaders and facilitators for more than twenty three years. For the last thirteen years we have focused on marriage ministry serving couples through studies, seminars, and retreats where biblical principles are the emphasis. <br/></p>
<p>In 2010 I started to write Marriage of Honor.(it didn't start out as a book) which was a collection of the many principles that we have learned and applied in our own marriage. Not having any background or knowledge of the publishing industry I set out to research and discover the possibilities that exist for this book. It quickly became clear to me that whatever direction I was going to take the key and perhaps the most important element was the marketing of this book. More research became necessary in this area and after many hours of searching and reading about marketing and publishing I was able to narrow down my list of possible partners that I can work with on this project. <br/></p>
<p>The next area that I needed answers for was how to fund this project. Again research unveiled many options the best being getting others involved in supporting this project. Crowd funding through Indiegogo became the most effective way to fund this project. This process gives individuals an opportunity to get involved, with amounts that both small and large.<br/></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $4500 dollars to be able to take this project to the next level. With these funds we will be able to publish the book and begin a marketing campaign that provides the best exposure. Our plan is get publicity with many radio and television producers that could grant us interviews before their listening audience. This exposure will get the message out sending customers to the best distributions channels. It will also provide an opportunity for us to follow-up with individuals, groups and churches providing studies and seminar materials. Additional marketing will take place with outreach on social media and with an improved internet presence. <br/></p>
<p>Getting Marriage of Honor published is important because it provides husbands and wives with proven principles and practical ideas that can make marriages stronger and more fulfilling. This book is short yet direct in it's approach as it deals with issues that are most important to both men and women. With these principles couples could first consider the differences that exist in most marriages and second focus on those issues that are the most important to their spouse.  </p>
<p>Supporting this project makes you a part of providing couples with the tools that God uses to make marriages Christ centered. Accomplishing this work in ministry strengthens marriages while establishing an effective and fruitful witness.  <br/></p>
<p>If we fall short of our desired goal we will seek to use the given funds as effectively as possible. The priority in which we will move forward is as follows: publishing, marketing, outreach, and internet presence. <br/></p>
<p>Applying these principles helps men and women to understand the uniqueness of their spouse while having a positive affect on the stability of their marriage. Marriage of Honor was written to deal with and to help couples improve their connection and enhance their relationship. These changes contribute greatly to strong marriages and healthy families everywhere.</p>
<p>You can support this project in other ways as well. Though your financial support will be greatly appreciated, passing this information on to others for their consideration will also be of great benefit to many. The perks listed below are provided based on your level of support. Some of the perks are based on new resources soon to be created for seminars and presentations. <br/></p>

<p>What if there was an ancient book that listed the rules for you to play the game of <em>your</em> life, and win?  Does that sound too good to be true?</p>
<p>... like <strong>the holy grail</strong>.</p>
<p>And what if this ancient book of life had been hidden in plain sight all these years, masquerading as the ordinary deck of playing cards?</p>
<p>Aren't you curious to find out for yourself?</p>
<p>I was.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><strong>The Starting Point</strong></h1>
<p>I was at a loft party in Brooklyn.  A friend of mine from Burning Man asked me my birthday.  August 30th, why?</p>
<p>""Oh,"" he says, ""<strong>your birth card is the 9 of Hearts</strong>. It means you've probably gone through many tragic endings of the heart.  You're learning how to let go of people without playing the victim.""</p>
<p>My knees buckled. My head spun. The day before, I was served divorce papers, unexpectedly. But really, if I was honest, and not playing the victim, it wasn't so unexpected.</p>
<h1>
<br/>It Happened With A Priest</h1>
<p>When I was 17, I went on a retreat offered by my catholic high school.  On it, a priest came to speak to us about walls around our hearts.  His talk moved me. </p>
<p>I stayed after to speak with him in a face-to-face confession style.  I don't remember what I said.  But at the end, he stood up to offer the final prayer of absolution.  He laid his hands on my forehead.  As he did, something when woooossshhh right through my body, like an electric current that washed me clean.</p>
<p>That experience <strong>propelled me on a quest</strong> for my adult life to know and understand what <strong><em>that </em></strong>was.</p>
<p>It led me to work as an Evangelical Youth Minister, leading bible studies on Harvard campus.  I underwent training to be a Roman Catholic Priest.  And when that didn't fit either (no celibacy for me thank you), I decided to move to New York to learn from the corporate world.  I worked as a consultant on Wall Street.</p>
<h1>
<br/>Into The Heart of Darkness</h1>
<p>Living in ""the city that never sleeps,"" I started venturing out at night, and into my own shadow side.  I didn't articulate it that way at the time, of course.  All I knew was that I wanted to go clubbing and take ecstasy. I was 26. I had only just started drinking alcohol. I didn't lose my virginity until I was 24.  </p>
<p>I tried every drug there was to try.  I cut loose.  I learned how to dance.  And I burned out the years of false piety and intellectual dogma stuffed in my head.  I purged it and discovered a new version of myself.  It was <strong>an initiation</strong> through psychedelic experience.</p>
<h1>
<br/>The Alchemy of Light and Dark</h1>
<p>Then, I went to India.  I lived in ashrams, meditating 8 hours a day.  Something shifted in me again.  Growing up, I had always been ""Alex.""  I returned to New York as Alexander, owning my full name, my birth right.  </p>
<p>I began apprenticing to Native American Shamanic Healers.  I met the mother of my children on a guided fast.  We started a holistic healing center together.  And then, one day, I found myself at a loft party in Brooklyn, where I found these Cards.  Or rather, the Cards found me.</p>
<p>It's like the story of the alchemist.  I searched the world over to find the meaning of life only to discover that it was <strong>hidden right in front of me</strong> the whole time.</p>
<p>Isn't <em>that </em>the truth?  <strong>The meaning of our life</strong> is right in front of our eyes if only we could lift the fog to see it clearly.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><strong>It's in the Cards</strong></h1>
<p>Very little has ever been written about these Cards.  Historically, they were kept secret by the Order of the Magi, the wise men and women who safeguarded their truth.</p>
<p>People used to be persecuted for reading these Cards.  It was called witchcraft or the work of the devil. </p>
<p>And yet, the Cards are so accurate for reading our life that expressions from them are now <strong>built into our vocabulary</strong>, expressions like ""put the cards on the table, find out what's in the cards, play our cards right, etc.""</p>
<h1>
<br/>The Mathematics of Our Cosmos</h1>
<p>The Cards are based purely on mathematics.  Unlike Tarot Cards, these Cards are <strong>scientific</strong>, based on numbers, with the <strong>precision</strong> of mathematical formula. </p>
<p>We each have 13 Cards in our Life Path, based on the mathematics of our birth date.  Once we know the meaning of each Card we have to play, we can see clearly:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. What is our primary gift to give in this world.</li>
<li>2. What is the biggest challenge we must face in this lifetime.</li>
<li>3. How we are in relationships and why they fail.</li>
<li>4. What our keys to financial abundance are.</li>
<li>5. What our greatest lesson is that we are here to learn.</li>
<li>6. What grounds us, supports us and what nourishes us.</li>
<li>7. What our shadow side is, the part of us that can sabotage us.</li>
<li>8. What our lifetime reward is for playing our cards right.</li>
<li>9. And much, much more.</li>
</ul><p>It's literally like getting the <strong>GPS Navigation</strong> for your Life.  You know exactly what to do to have the most enjoyable, wonderful, growing experience of life.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1><strong>Win the Game of Your Life</strong></h1>
<p>So, what I'm doing is writing a guidebook where I lay out the meaning of each Card as it appears in your Life Path.  Your Life Path starts on your birthday. Starting from that point, you have 13 Cards in your life to play. </p>
<p>If you know your birthday, you can use this guide book.</p>
<p>You simply look up your birth date to find out exactly what your Life Path is as it is laid out in the Cards.  Then, you'll know your true purpose in life.  And, you will know how to <strong>live a magical life</strong>.  </p>
<p>There's a reason why these Cards are associated to magic.  It's because when we play our Cards right, life is magical.  All of life aligns for us, <strong>synchronicity </strong>happens, doors open, the right people show up, and we manifest the life we really want.  I've seen it over and over again in my private coaching practice.</p>
<p>These cards aren't for playing poker.  They are for playing the game of our life!</p>
<h1>
<br/>In This Guide Book</h1>
<p>In addition to learning your Life Path as it's laid out in the Cards, (as if that wasn't enough to learn), you will learn the back ground and history of these Cards, the meaning of all the numbers of the Cards, the meaning of each of the 4 suits and the real meaning of the expression:  A House of Cards.</p>
<p>Most importantly, by learning the meaning of the 13 Cards in your Life Path, you will <strong>get the rule book to play the game of your life, and win</strong>.</p>
<p>You will also see some common applications of this knowledge to everyday life for professional development, sales training, life coaching, career goals, relationship issues, parenting strategies, and personal growth.</p>
<h1>
<br/>Who Benefits Most From This Guide Book?</h1>
<p>Yes, every single human being on this planet (who reads English) could use this guide book to live his or her meaning of life.  We already always live according to the mathematics of our life.  We just don't know it.  So, we fumble around in the dark, lost and confused, bemoaning our existence.</p>
<p>And all the while, the book of life that could <strong>show us the way</strong> has been hidden right in front of our eyes!</p>
<p>Having said that, this guide book will have the most benefit to people who have a compelling interest in the growth and development of themselves and the people around them.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Parents </strong>who want to empower their children to great heights in life</li>

<strong>Therapists / Life Coaches</strong> who want to quickly uncover the root issues that are keeping people stuck in their lives</li>

<h3>I don't know of any reading of the yoga sutras as wildly creative, as impassioned and as earnest as this. it engages Patanjali and the reader in an urgent, electrified conversation that weaves philosophy, symbolist poetry, psychoanalysis and cultural history. There's a kind of delight and freshness in this book that is very rare in writing on yoga, and especially rare in writing on the yoga sutras.

<p>I have retranslated the <em>Yoga Sutras</em> of Patanjali for our present paradigm.

<h3>A little background.</h3>
<p>I've been writing <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_2?_encoding=UTF8&amp;field-author=Matthew%20Remski&amp;search-alias=books"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">novels and poetry</a> from the age of 20. About five years ago, I turned my writing attention to ayurveda, and yoga philosophy. I've written extensively on my own <a href=""http://matthewremski.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">blog</a>, and on <a href=""http://www.elephantjournal.com/author/yoga-20-lab/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Elephant Journal</a>. In 2008 I began collaborating with Scott Petrie on the <a href=""http://yoga2point0.com/wordpress/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Yoga 2.0 project</a>, an experiment in open-source yoga philosophy. Over the past four years, we have developed innovative modules for yoga teacher training programmes in the Toronto area, focusing on community building, conscious communication, and navigating the paradoxes of teaching yoga in a consumerist culture. Our work culminated in co-authoring <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/yoga-2-0-shamanic-echoes-ebook/dp/B004NSV9DM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">yoga 2.0: shamanic echoes</a>, and producing the <a href=""http://yoga2point0.com/wordpress/?p=1390"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">first draft</a> of the translation that forms the core of the present book. My full resume is <a href=""http://matthewremski.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Matthew-Remski-Resume.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. I'm especially honoured to be included in the recently-published <a href=""http://21centuryyoga.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>21st Century Yoga: Culture, Politics, and Practice: A critical examination of yoga in North America</em></a>, edited by Carol Horton and Roseanne Harvey.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The longer story.</h3>
<p>I've always loved the <em>Yoga Sutras</em>. </p>
<p>The ancient text presents a brilliant picture of our internal complexity, our psycho-somatic interweave, our capacity for self-reflection, and our potential for clarity. Its 196 aphorisms are stirring, sonorous, and they reverberate from a place of deep stillness. Rare amongst spiritual classics, it is completely non-denominational, and points to no other authority for the measurement of evolution than the radiance of personal experience.</p>
<p>But the old book also carries strong echoes of a time and culture almost inconceivably different from our own. Written by and for ascetics who longed to escape the psychic pressures of their brutal civilization, it features several themes that contemporary yoga culture no longer needs. It suggests that our flesh is an impure obstruction to happiness. It promises levitation and the ability to body-snatch. It offers a clearly transcendent path, with little interest in interpersonal relationship, and no mention at all of family, social justice, ecological intelligence, or love.</p>
<p>Here's the paradox. The <em>Yoga Sutras </em>is a core text of contemporary yoga culture. It is required reading in all yoga teacher training programmes worldwide. And, it contains heavy doses of a philosophy we neither hold nor can use, while failing to speak to some of our dearest concerns.</p>
<p>After a decade of yoga practice and contemplation of the sutras, I decided that the best way to re-invigorate this beautiful but flawed book was to literally ""remix"" it. I've retranslated the sutras to be able to carry contemporary advancements in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, and interspersed the aphorisms with my own commentary and reflections on practice. You can preview the finished work <a href=""http://matthewremski.com/wordpress/?page_id=1564"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>My intention is to open a new stream of discourse in our community about how we interact with ancient traditions: what we keep, what we must leave behind, and what we change by merely encountering it. My hope is that this book will make it onto the reading lists of every teacher training programme in the English-speaking world, to hasten our general movement towards intersubjective, socially aware, ecologically sound, and scientifically astute practice.</p>
<p>The book will number between 240 and 280 pages, depending upon how my designer works her magic. I'm asking for contributions to pay her, and my publicist, and for promotional costs as I navigate the jungle of self-publishing. </p>

<p>The Author</p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<h3 class=""subheader"">Profiler est une des plus vieilles activités sociales de notre espèce. Malheureusement, stéréotyper également.</h3>
<p class=""subheader"">SNAP a été créé pour simplifier le 1er point, et limiter le second.</p>
<p class=""subheader"">Son cadre opérationnel : votre activité au sein de l'entreprise. Que vous soyez cadre, manager, négociateur, commercial, chargé de la sécurité, etc. Deux questions sont fondamentales lorsque vous rencontrez quelqu'un.                               </p>
<p class=""subheader"">En toute discrétion, SNAP permet de répondre avec un taux de fiabilité élevé aux fondements même du profiling civil. Un :  comment l'individu communique avec son entourage ?  Deux : comment agira-t-il ?</p>
<p><br/><strong>Brain Persuasion en quelques lignes ? </strong></p>
<p>La vidéo decrira bien mieux que des mots le principe de base de SNAP. Néanmoisn pour résumer, SNAP est discret. SNAP est facile à apprendre. SNAP s'appuie sur votre propre profil pour vous limiter vos stéréotypes.</p>
<p>et surtout SNAP vous donne une ""carte routière"" une fois le profil établi pour vous aider à mioeux interagir avec l'individu profilé.</p>
<p>Pour mémoire, certains pays commencent à interdire le recours à des profils par questionnaires même pour le recrutement. Comment ferez-vous dans quelques années ? Vous en ferez confiance qu'à votre intuition ?</p>
<h3>Pourquoi du crowdfounding ?</h3>
<p>Parce que profiler est une activité extrêmement courante pour chacun d'entre nous. Alors pourquoi pas permettre à chacun d'entre nous de participer en fonction de ses envies à ce programme.</p>
<p>Ensuite le crowdfounding permet une interaction active entre le lecteur et l'auteur ce qui permet de faire évoluer plus rapidement la pensée de l'un et de l'autre.</p>
<h3>Votre impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Les petits ruisseaux font les grandes rivières et les études sont coûteuses. Faire avancer ces sujets passionnants font partie des objectifs de l'auteur, et je l'espère des vôtres.</li>
<li>Ceux qui ont eu l'occasion de me côtoyer lors de formations savent que ce sujet est un de mes aiguillons personnels. Ils savent aussi je l'espère que j'aime partager le fond d'un sujet car la connaissance s'enrichie de cet échange.</li>
<li>La méthode SNAP101 est simple mais repose sur un corpus scientifique important et sans cesse en croissance : celui des variantes du Big Fives. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Pourquoi pré-vendre cet ouvrage ?</h3>
<p>Plusieurs raisons m'ont poussé vers cette solution :</p>
<ul>
<li>Un manuel sur ce sujet ne peut être définitif. Le faire évoluer au fil du temps est donc une nécessité. Ce qui exclu tout intermédiaire classique de l'édition.</li>
<li>Le monde est  dynamique, j'espère que nos manuels le seront aussi! La prévente permet de vous proposer beaucoup plus d'options qu'un manuel habituel. Regardez plus bas pour vous en convaincre.</li>
</ul>
<ul>

Profiler est une des plus vieilles activités sociales de notre espèce. Malheureusement, stéréotyper également.
SNAP a été créé pour simplifier le 1er point, et limiter le second.
Son cadre opérationnel : votre activité au sein de l'entreprise. Que vous soyez cadre, manager, négociateur, commercial, chargé de la sécurité, etc. Deux questions sont fondamentales lorsque vous rencontrez quelqu'un.                               
En toute discrétion, SNAP permet de répondre avec un taux de fiabilité élevé aux fondements même du profiling civil. Un :  comment l'individu communique avec son entourage ?  Deux : comment agira-t-il ?
Brain Persuasion en quelques lignes ? 
La vidéo decrira bien mieux que des mots le principe de base de SNAP. Néanmoisn pour résumer, SNAP est discret. SNAP est facile à apprendre. SNAP s'appuie sur votre propre profil pour vous limiter vos stéréotypes.
et surtout SNAP vous donne une ""carte routière"" une fois le profil établi pour vous aider à mioeux interagir avec l'individu profilé.
Pour mémoire, certains pays commencent à interdire le recours à des profils par questionnaires même pour le recrutement. Comment ferez-vous dans quelques années ? Vous en ferez confiance qu'à votre intuition ?
Pourquoi du crowdfounding ?
Parce que profiler est une activité extrêmement courante pour chacun d'entre nous. Alors pourquoi pas permettre à chacun d'entre nous de participer en fonction de ses envies à ce programme.
Ensuite le crowdfounding permet une interaction active entre le lecteur et l'auteur ce qui permet de faire évoluer plus rapidement la pensée de l'un et de l'autre.
Votre impact

Les petits ruisseaux font les grandes rivières et les études sont coûteuses. Faire avancer ces sujets passionnants font partie des objectifs de l'auteur, et je l'espère des vôtres.
Ceux qui ont eu l'occasion de me côtoyer lors de formations savent que ce sujet est un de mes aiguillons personnels. Ils savent aussi je l'espère que j'aime partager le fond d'un sujet car la connaissance s'enrichie de cet échange.
La méthode SNAP101 est simple mais repose sur un corpus scientifique important et sans cesse en croissance : celui des variantes du Big Fives. 

Pourquoi pré-vendre cet ouvrage ?
Plusieurs raisons m'ont poussé vers cette solution :

Un manuel sur ce sujet ne peut être définitif. Le faire évoluer au fil du temps est donc une nécessité. Ce qui exclu tout intermédiaire classique de l'édition.
Le monde est  dynamique, j'espère que nos manuels le seront aussi! La prévente permet de vous proposer beaucoup plus d'options qu'un manuel habituel. Regardez plus bas pour vous en convaincre.

La seconde permettre aux personnes intéressées de participer à un échange direct de questions/réponses, d'éclaircissements, d'approfondissement, etc.


Ces deux cas et les autres options ne peuvent exister que si l'intérêt est suffisant, et que le calendrier maitrisé compte tenu de nos activités professionnelles.
La prévente est le modèle idéal pour cela.
Si les préventes n'atteignent pas la somme minimale fixée, je compléterais le  delta pour lancer néanmoins les projets prévus. ET certains seront - je      l'espère - privilégiés de pouvoir accéder à ces approches modernes de      persuasion.

<h3>About Me and the Project</h3>
<p>My name is Alex Sarmiento, and I'm a writer/student. I am originally from San Francisco, but I currently live in Fairfield, home to a giant mall and the Travis Air Force Base. </p>
<p>SAINT GRAZIANO THE GOOD has been a labor of love since fall of 2009. I have long wanted to write a novel, but never got around to doing it. It wasn't until I went to Toronto for a week-long vacation that I finally got the inspiration to do so.</p>
<p>This is the first book that I have ever written. I have done poetry, screenwriting, and short stories, and will continue to do so in the future. Aside from posting on blogs, I am an unpublished writer.</p>

<h3>The Money</h3>
<p>I completed the manuscript in late March of 2012. The money will be going towards self-publishing costs and other refinements. I want to raise at least $1,000. With the money, I can help get my book (and my writing career) off the ground.</p>

<h3>What You Get Out Of It (Aside From A Tote Bag)</h3>
<p>Okay, there is no tote bag. In addition to the thank you gifts, you will get the satisfaction of helping me launch my career.

<h3>Summary of Me</h3>
<p>Hello all. M.P. Fulk here. I'm a recent college graduate with a degree in creative writing and a manuscript in need of readers. That means I have a piece of paper stating I know what I'm doing and another one to back it up. Maybe--that's for you to decide!</p>
<p>Anywho, I won't ramble on. Rather than write a chunk of text summarizing the story, I'll point you to the video above, which is me reading the Prologue for your enjoyment. Then I'll point you to one of the two links above, which preview the prologue and the first three chapters of the manuscript. I avoided reading more because I was scared to do all the voices for dialogue. You know how it is. <br/></p>
<p>(Okay, short summary: Devil escapes Hell, mayhem ensues. I warned you it was short.)<br/></p>
<p>This story is part of a series. Think of it as the cornerstone, sort of a foundation, if you will--there is a direct sequel and several other stories set in the same universe, but the series will be more horizontal than vertical. That is, <i>The Fallen</i> focuses on fallen angels while the sequel focuses on humanity, while another story focuses on demons, and so on. My take on the supernatural set in our real world. </p>
<p><i>The Fallen</i> is the first novel in an as yet unnumbered (but nearing two-complete-stories-long) series. After millennia in Hell, Lucifer breaks free, but not to lead mankind astray or tear down the Kingdom of Heaven: He has his own goals in mind. Upon reconnecting with old friend and allies-turned-enemies, he finds the world has changed. But nothing can stand in the way of the Devil unbound.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Gist<br/>
</h3>So, this is something of an experiment. Over the last few years I've been writing on-and-off an urban fantasy/supernatural manuscript. In the last few months, I've polished and rewritten the manuscript to the point where I'm happy with it and ready to start pitching to literary agents or ready to consider self-publishing. <br/><br/>But before that, I want to make one final sweep through the manuscript, working out the kinks and potential inconsistencies that stem from the revision process, and I'd love to have readers along for the ride. <br/><br/><h3>The Plan</h3>Everyone that donates $10 or more will receive an email update once a week (Wednesday evenings) including a PDF file of the latest 4-6 chapters of the manuscript. That equates to about 10-15 single-spaced pages a week. Or roughly the amount of time it would take to watch an episode of your favorite television show. <br/><br/>Of course, these will be rolling updates. So when you first donate, I will send you an endearing thank-you note and a PDF file including all the chapters that have been released since the start of the project. And rather than ""starting from scratch"" for those that donate early, the first week's ""update"" will be the first 24 chapters of the manuscript, about 25% of the total. [There are currently 98 chapters. I may need to add a chapter or two as we go along to placate my OCD.]<br/><br/>And in case I've confused anyone, here's a simple example of how weekly updates would work: <br/><br/>Ex 1. Billy donates week 1. He receives a PDF of 24 chapters and then weekly updates. <br/>Ex 2. Bob donates week 4. He receives a PDF of 39 chapters (24+15~) and then weekly updates. <br/><br/>For those of you faster at math than I am, you may notice that the chapter updates would extend past the project deadline. This is true! As I've planned now, the entire project will take around 15 weeks. Due to the site's 60-day time constraint, the project will be split into two parts. <br/><br/>But please be aware that you DO NOT have to donate twice. Unless you're feeling generous, of course. Splitting the project into two parts does not affect you or your perks, only gives me more breathing room. I may speed up the updating process and cut the project closer to three months, but with holidays approaching and family hijacking looming, I would rather give everyone a later end date than one I might possibly overshoot. <br/><br/>End of Project (ETA March 1): you will receive a copy of the manuscript in ebook format or a complete PDF, whichever you prefer. Random note goes here--if you only want the ebook/completed manuscript and would like to opt-out of weekly updates, that's cool too, just message me! <br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Networking Love</h3>
<p>Obligatory ""your-voice-can-help-me-so-so-much"" part. If you would, please consider posting a link to this project on your Facebook page, Twitter, Tumblr, blogs or Whozitz. Better yet, pick out a line or quote you particularly like and post <i>that </i>on your social media first, then send the project link to interested friends, twits and tumbleweeds. <br/></p>
<p>Check out the Facebook page for discussions and random postings. The Tumblr page has short stories, notes on <i>The Fallen</i> and exclusive character sketches highlighting some of the more obscure characters. <br/></p>
<p>If you've read all this, thank you so much. If you've read the preview too, thanks even more. If you've only read this, then you're reading backwards, which is weird. Anyway, thank you, thank you! Hopefully together we can make this novel a success!</p>

Then I'll point you to one of the two links above, which preview the prologue and the first three chapters of the manuscript. I avoided reading more because I was scared to do all the voices for dialogue. You know how it is. 
(Okay, short summary: Devil escapes Hell, mayhem ensues. I warned you it was short.)
This story is part of a series. Think of it as the cornerstone, sort of a foundation, if you will--there is a direct sequel and several other stories set in the same universe, but the series will be more horizontal than vertical. That is, The Fallen focuses on fallen angels while the sequel focuses on humanity, while another story focuses on demons, and so on. My take on the supernatural set in our real world. 
The Fallen is the first novel in an as yet unnumbered (but nearing two-complete-stories-long) series. After millennia in Hell, Lucifer breaks free, but not to lead mankind astray or tear down the Kingdom of Heaven: He has his own goals in mind. Upon reconnecting with old friend and allies-turned-enemies, he finds the world has changed. But nothing can stand in the way of the Devil unbound.


The Gist
So, this is something of an experiment. Over the last few years I've been writing on-and-off an urban fantasy/supernatural manuscript. In the last few months, I've polished and rewritten the manuscript to the point where I'm happy with it and ready to start pitching to literary agents or ready to consider self-publishing. But before that, I want to make one final sweep through the manuscript, working out the kinks and potential inconsistencies that stem from the revision process, and I'd love to have readers along for the ride. The PlanEveryone that donates $10 or more will receive an email update once a week (Wednesday evenings) including a PDF file of the latest 4-6 chapters of the manuscript. That equates to about 10-15 single-spaced pages a week. Or roughly the amount of time it would take to watch an episode of your favorite television show. Of course, these will be rolling updates. So when you first donate, I will send you an endearing thank-you note and a PDF file including all the chapters that have been released since the start of the project. And rather than ""starting from scratch"" for those that donate early, the first week's ""update"" will be the first 24 chapters of the manuscript, about 25% of the total. [There are currently 98 chapters. I may need to add a chapter or two as we go along to placate my OCD.]And in case I've confused anyone, here's a simple example of how weekly updates would work: Ex 1. Billy donates week 1. He receives a PDF of 24 chapters and then weekly updates. Ex 2. Bob donates week 4. He receives a PDF of 39 chapters (24+15~) and then weekly updates. For those of you faster at math than I am, you may notice that the chapter updates would extend past the project deadline. This is true! As I've planned now, the entire project will take around 15 weeks. Due to the site's 60-day time constraint, the project will be split into two parts. But please be aware that you DO NOT have to donate twice. Unless you're feeling generous, of course. Splitting the project into two parts does not affect you or your perks, only gives me more breathing room. I may speed up the updating process and cut the project closer to three months, but with holidays approaching and family hijacking looming, I would rather give everyone a later end date than one I might possibly overshoot. End of Project (ETA March 1): you will receive a copy of the manuscript in ebook format or a complete PDF, whichever you prefer. Random note goes here--if you only want the ebook/completed manuscript and would like to opt-out of weekly updates, that's cool too, just message me! 

Networking Love
Obligatory ""your-voice-can-help-me-so-so-much"" part. If you would, please consider posting a link to this project on your Facebook page, Twitter, Tumblr, blogs or Whozitz. Better yet, pick out a line or quote you particularly like and post that on your social media first, then send the project link to interested friends, twits and tumbleweeds. 
Check out the Facebook page for discussions and random postings. The Tumblr page has short stories, notes on The Fallen and exclusive character sketches highlighting some of the more obscure characters. 
If you've read all this, thank you so much. If you've read the preview too, thanks even more. If you've only read this, then you're reading backwards, which is weird. Anyway, thank you, thank you! Hopefully together we can make this novel a success!

<h3><font size=""2"">When people think about the baby boomer generation, it often conjures up mental images of Ozzie and Harriet, hula hoops, or dish towels in detergent boxes.

We interviewed many members of our generation from all areas of the United States- from the suburbs, cities, rural areas, inner cities, as well as from all economic backgrounds. We extensively report on their views, experiences, and perspectives, often in their own words.  </font></strong></p>

The Book
When people think about the baby boomer generation, it often conjures up mental images of Ozzie and Harriet, hula hoops, or dish towels in detergent boxes. We are two boomer women co-authoring a book about the real lives of our generation,  including the nostalgia, but also the secrets and unspoken realities of our youth and every decade since then.
Once Upon Our Times ( Because Life Isn't A Fairytale) 65 Years Growing Up Baby Boomer will be part history, part nostalgia, part pictorial, part investigative journalism, and entirely truthful. We interviewed many members of our generation from all areas of the United States- from the suburbs, cities, rural areas, inner cities, as well as from all economic backgrounds. We extensively report on their views, experiences, and perspectives, often in their own words.  
Some subjects we explore are: the impact of WWII, our parents' generation, suburban growth, the Cold War, politics, lifestyles of each decade, gender roles, money issues, retirement,  clothes, movies, books, music, fads, morals, sex ed, education, Civil Rights, abortion, sports through the decades, growing up different from your peers (disabled, gay, transgender, divorce, addiction, religion, race. teenage pregnancy, abuse, and even teachers who were sexual predators ) Yes, it existed way back then, too!   
 
Baby boomers are now turning 65 at a rate of about 10,000 per day.  We are your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, and even your children.  We are still active as we redefine aging, just as we actively changed the course of history throughout our lives.  
 
Before computers, cell phones, video games and cd's, before Prozac, before the Civil Rights Movement, the Equal Rights Movement, and Gay Pride, and around the same time TV was  born, so were we.  About 79 million baby boomers. Everyone has a story. This is ours.
Impact

It is our hope that this ground-breaking book is viewed as an important baby boomer history book as well as a thought-provoking and entertaining read for all generations.  In our quest for balance and understanding, we try to have both sides of a controversial issue represented.  We strive to encourage  increased tolerance of minorities through our writing. We also hope this book will find its way into every high school and university library. 
 
We have partnered with Ronald McDonald House near Lurie Children's- Chicago as well as Island Harvest on Long Island, so we will donate a portion of the book's sales proceeds to them. They are grateful our book will help them raise much-needed funds.

<h2>Who is the Goddess Sharada?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><span><em>“The Radiant Goddess known as Shri Sharada is venerated wherever She manifests  </em></span><em>Herself amongst the people as the beautiful incandescence of the Autumn Moon. </em><em>She unites all people through the expression of their own magnanimous qualities.”  </em></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">-Shaiva Master Abhinava Gupta (ca. 950-1025 A.D.).</p>
<p>                    <img alt=""Sharada"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://yogawithina.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/my_%C5%9A%C4%81rad%C4%81noglow.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 565.278px; height: 623px;"" title=""Sharada""/>  </p>
<p><span>Sharada means ‘Autumn.’ </span></p>
<p><span>A Tantric personification of the Goddess Sarasvati, Sharada represents the liberating light of the waxing moon.  </span></p>
<p><span>For well over a thousand years, Sharada has been venerated by the Shaivas of Kashmir as their Matron Goddess, as the magnanimous spirit of Kashmir itself who personifies the power (shakti) of Awakened Consciousness (shiva) which resides within all beings. </span></p>
<p><span>But for centuries She has been worshiped by the descendants of the Kashmiri Shaivas, who are now in exile from their homeland, without Her central ritual, the <strong><em>Sharada Sahasra Nama</em></strong>—<strong>UNTIL NOW</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><b><em>“Sharada is not a being but an essence, </em><em>not a goddess but the nectar of moonlight, </em><em>enveloping humanity eternally. </em><em>She is a song which reverberates the corridors of time </em><em>with the message of Love.”</em></b></p>
<p>-Modern Kashmiri Pandit, Poet Maharaj Kaul.</p>

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>My name is Christopher Tompkins, and over the last eleven years I have shared the empowering teachings of Tantric Shaivism with over 10,000 people across the globe. </p>

<p><span>The vast majority of surviving manuscripts which represent this tradition remain in Kashmir; they have endured through the centuries </span><span>solely</span><span> due to the painstaking efforts of <span>generation</span>s of Shaiva scholars known as Pandits (‘Learned Ones’), who diligently copied them by hand (below). </span></p>

To transcribe, translate, and publish the  ""1000 Names of Sharada,"" from the original Sanskrit; the core ritual for this Matron Goddess of Kashmir Shaivism, which was lost centuries ago and only recently re-discovered.



To fund the performance of this sacred ritual for the first time in centuries, during the prescribed time of the Nava Ratri festival (‘Nine Nights’ of the Goddess) this Fall, 2013.


excerpt of the ""Thousand Names of Sharada"" text











Who is the Goddess Sharada?
“The Radiant Goddess known as Shri Sharada is venerated wherever She manifests  Herself amongst the people as the beautiful incandescence of the Autumn Moon. She unites all people through the expression of their own magnanimous qualities.”  
-Shaiva Master Abhinava Gupta (ca. 950-1025 A.D.).
                      
Sharada means ‘Autumn.’ 
A Tantric personification of the Goddess Sarasvati, Sharada represents the liberating light of the waxing moon.  
For well over a thousand years, Sharada has been venerated by the Shaivas of Kashmir as their Matron Goddess, as the magnanimous spirit of Kashmir itself who personifies the power (shakti) of Awakened Consciousness (shiva) which resides within all beings. 
But for centuries She has been worshiped by the descendants of the Kashmiri Shaivas, who are now in exile from their homeland, without Her central ritual, the Sharada Sahasra Nama—UNTIL NOW.
 
“Sharada is not a being but an essence, not a goddess but the nectar of moonlight, enveloping humanity eternally. She is a song which reverberates the corridors of time with the message of Love.”
-Modern Kashmiri Pandit, Poet Maharaj Kaul.
 
The Story
My name is Christopher Tompkins, and over the last eleven years I have shared the empowering teachings of Tantric Shaivism with over 10,000 people across the globe. 


The vast majority of surviving manuscripts which represent this tradition remain in Kashmir; they have endured through the centuries solely due to the painstaking efforts of generations of Shaiva scholars known as Pandits (‘Learned Ones’), who diligently copied them by hand (below). 
 

               19th century Kashmiri Pandits copy manuscripts for preservation
Due to foreign invasion and persecution, the peaceful Pandits were forced into a final exile from their homeland in 1990, and had to leave these precious manuscripts behind.
Today, thousands of Tantric texts precariously survive in the hands of people who have no interest in this sacred tradition. 
Since then, most Westerners with the ability to translate and preserve these texts have been denied access to this literary legacy... 
I was determined to beat the odds.


In March of 2012, I founded the Tantric (Shaiva) Manuscript Acquisition Project (TMAP), in order to retrieve as many of these sacred manuscripts as possible from Kashmir and make them freely available to other scholars and practitioners before they are lost forever.  



Thanks to the generous support of our community, I raised $13,000 in 2 weeks, and set off for the valley of Kashmir. I returned in May 2012 with over 25,000 scanned pages of unpublished Shaiva manuscripts. 
This was the most successful acquisition attempt ever made.

                                                                                                Valley of Kashmir
While in Kashmir, I set off to four of the five shrines, now largely abandoned, where I ceremoniously re-installed the mantras of these Goddesses that are imbued contain their vibrational energy (shakti). Sadly, I was not able to pilgrimage to the temple of  Sharada, the oldest and most venerated Kashmiri Goddess of all, located in present-day Pakistan. I swore that someday I would find a way to the shrine of Sharada Devi.
Instead, Sharada found me.

                                                               above the valley of Kashmir, May 2012.
While cataloging the acquired manuscripts, I made a most auspicious discovery--the previously lost Sharada Sahasra Nama (""The Thousand Names of Goddess Sharada"") mis-catalogued by the archivists.
Composed in antiquity by a devotee named Sahajaka (‘Spontaneous One’), the text is written in ‘Sharada,’ the beautiful Kashmiri script of the Sanskrit language named after the Goddess Herself (below)-- imbuing the 1,000 names with her very Presence and Power.

                                             excerpt, Thousand Names of Sharada (Sahasra Nama) 

The beautiful ‘1000 Names of Sharada’ (Sharada Sahasra Nama), lost and forgotten for centuries, has returned to us via a six-foot long scroll, preserving the most sacred and core ritual of Shri Sharada, the matron Goddess of Kashmir.

<p>My name is Courtney Simchak and I am a senior at Texas State University-San Marcos, majoring in Creative Writing and minoring in Honors Studies. As an honor's student I have two major requirements that I need to complete in order to graduate within the program:  a study-abroad experience and a completed honor's poetry thesis.</p>
<p>Both have been very difficult for me to complete, due to my financial situation and responsibilities. I have been unable to find the time and the space in order for me to finish my first complete book of poems for my honor's thesis and I have not been able to raise the tuition costs needed to study abroad.</p>
<p>By the grace of a dear friend, I have been given an amazing opportunity to travel to Ireland and stay for a week in Galway for much cheaper than it would have been for me to pay the tuition for an official study abroad program and I have also been offered the discounted opportunity to stay at a house in Enniscrone for a week to allow for me to work on my thesis.</p>
<p>With the left-overs of my Spring financial aid and some saved up funds I have managed to cover the costs of my airplane ticket, my passport and the cost of lodging in Enniscrone, but I need help with funding the day-to-day costs of travel. </p>
<p>This campaign is to help raise funds to cover the costs of food, busfare, a proper raincoat (an imperative piece of equipment, I am told) and the entry fees for museums, etc. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>With your help, the impact from this trip could be enormous. This amazing opportunity will allow for me to have the experience of a lifetime, exploring and being exposed to a beautiful culture outside of my own and will also offer the precious time and space needed for to me to finish writing my honor's thesis.</p>
<p>The ability to visit Dublin, Cliffs of Moher, Galway City and Enniscrone will undoubtedly alter and expand my experience with the world and the access to such a quiet but intense landscape is exactly the kind of sensory research and experience I need to complete my first book.</p>
<p>Without the funding for this trip, fundraised by Indie Go-Go, it will be very difficult for me to travel in Ireland. I currently have enough cover my lodging and plane ticket, but without funds for food and intercity travel (bus, taxi, etc.), it will be impossible for me to take full advantage of this experience. I feel deep down, that this trip could be really extraordinary--not only for my work, but for my own life and self, as well. In the very least of it, I will be completing graduation requirements to finish my Undergraduate education!  I would really like to take advantage of the opportunity that has been set before me and would like your help to do it.</p>
<p>Help a colleen fund her trip to one the prettiest places on earth!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What I Need</strong></p>
<p>I have some money saved up to cover the big costs of travel, so I officially have my airfare, lodging and passport taken care of, but I need funding for the day-to-day costs of travel, like a good raincoat, food and bus fare. </p>
<p>Your donation will go towards the following items:</p>
<p>To offset gas costs for car trips: $50.00<em> (37 euros)</em></p>
<p><em><br/></em><strong>What donations have been covered so far: </strong></p>
<p>Averaged cost for food at roughly $26 (20 euros) a day, for <strong>14</strong> days: 364.00 (278 euros)</p>

With the left-overs of my Spring financial aid and some saved up funds I have managed to cover the costs of my airplane ticket, my passport and the cost of lodging in Enniscrone, but I need help with funding the day-to-day costs of travel. 
This campaign is to help raise funds to cover the costs of food, busfare, a proper raincoat (an imperative piece of equipment, I am told) and the entry fees for museums, etc. 
The Impact
With your help, the impact from this trip could be enormous. This amazing opportunity will allow for me to have the experience of a lifetime, exploring and being exposed to a beautiful culture outside of my own and will also offer the precious time and space needed for to me to finish writing my honor's thesis.
The ability to visit Dublin, Cliffs of Moher, Galway City and Enniscrone will undoubtedly alter and expand my experience with the world and the access to such a quiet but intense landscape is exactly the kind of sensory research and experience I need to complete my first book.
Without the funding for this trip, fundraised by Indie Go-Go, it will be very difficult for me to travel in Ireland. I currently have enough cover my lodging and plane ticket, but without funds for food and intercity travel (bus, taxi, etc.), it will be impossible for me to take full advantage of this experience. I feel deep down, that this trip could be really extraordinary--not only for my work, but for my own life and self, as well. In the very least of it, I will be completing graduation requirements to finish my Undergraduate education!  I would really like to take advantage of the opportunity that has been set before me and would like your help to do it.
Help a colleen fund her trip to one the prettiest places on earth!
 
What I Need
I have some money saved up to cover the big costs of travel, so I officially have my airfare, lodging and passport taken care of, but I need funding for the day-to-day costs of travel, like a good raincoat, food and bus fare. 
Your donation will go towards the following items:

Bus fare from Enniscrone to Dublin: $26.00 (19 euros)

<p>Marsy goes from planning a hairnet revolution to plotting a complicated bank robbery. Enter Mr. Darcy, who inspires her to start a whole new line of Mr. Darcy greeting cards and to get her love life in order. Clark, Marsy's brother &amp; Cortez Marsy's long time crush are along for the ride to Marsy's Mom and step-Dad's Hawaiian wedding. This merged family wedding is bound to be filled with drama.

<p><span class=""userContent""><span class=""text_exposed_show""> With all the sex in 50 Shades of Grey &amp; all the magic in Harry Potter completely missing, Nerdy Little Secrets crawls inside the mind of a twenty-year-old lusty, nerdy, desperate virgin.

Embarrassingly honest and heartrendingly truthful, Marsy will make you laugh and see all the beauty in the everyday human experience.</span></span></p>
<h2><strong>Between the Ditches</strong></h2>
<p>Marsy Clemens is impetuous, tenacious, determined, creative and slightly desperate.

</span></p>
<p>President Park Geun-hye and the South Korean government have
failed once again to keep their promises for an investigation that will bring
answers to the question.  Their treatment
of the victims' families have been beyond inhumane since the disaster.  Instead of providing adequate support to the
families and helping them to heal from the trauma of losing their children, the
government took over their social media accounts and placed them under illegal
surveillance using undercover police. Members of President Park’s party spread
false rumors coloring the families as money-hungry revolts and communists in
attempts to manipulate public sentiment against them. While ten families are
still waiting to retrieve the bodies of their lost children, members of President
Park’s party have told the families to quit mourning and start moving on with life.
The riot police violently suppressed the families and supporters during peaceful march,
blocking them with walls of barricade and shooting them with
high-pressured water hose.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/755010/files/20140730143958-051013.jpg?1406756398"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>The families never asked for any monetary compensation or
even medical help. The only thing they have been seeking since Day 1 was the truth – why was a disaster like this even allowed in the first place, and
why weren’t any of their children saved? 
</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/755011/files/20140730144031-840849_article.jpg?1406756431"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>The families soon realized that their trust in the tears of President Park shed in front of the cameras were lost in vain. They started a
rally demanding a special legislation to be enacted. The ""Sewol Ferry Act,"" which will involve independent and thorough investigation of the disaster with prosecution of those who are responsible, will serve as groundwork to finally putting
an end to disasters caused by governmental corruption and corporate greed prevalent in South Korea.  It will also
serve as a corner stone to building a solid plan that will prevent future
disasters like Sewol.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The Elements of Sewol Ferry Act -- proposed by the families of the victims</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Form a Special Committee that the families of the victims and public can trust:  8 members elected by the congress and 8 members elected by the group representing the families<br/><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">2. </span><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">Guarantee an adequate time (up to 3 years) for </span><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">the Special Committee to carry out a thorough investigation, prosecution and </span><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">construction of a plan to prevent future disasters<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(119, 119, 119); background-color: initial;"">3. </span>Form technical subcommittees within the Special Committee:<br/>       a. Independent Investigation Committee<br/>     b. Safety Planning and Disaster Prevention Committee<br/>     c. Commemoration Committee<br/>4. Guaranteed rights to investigate and prosecute to be exercised by the Special Committee:  Without these two rights, a thorough investigation and prevention of<br/>future disasters will not be made possible<br/>5. Guaranteed implementation and enforcement of Disaster Prevention Plan: <br/>      a. The Committee submits the Plan to the congress<br/>     b. Related agencies periodically submit reports of the status of implementation to the congress<br/>    c. If not followed through, the responsible agencies and personnel  receive disciplinary retribution </p>
<br/><p>What the families are asking only makes sense. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">What they are
asking is not much. But for some reason, it seems to be too big of a pill for the Park
Geun-hye administration to swallow. You can't help but wonder, what are they so
afraid of?</span></p>
<p>In today’s global society where close to one million
foreigners live in South Korea, of which 120,000 are Americans, the lack of public safety due to government's negligence and corruption is not only their problem, but our
problem.  In order to make a safer
society and prevent history from repeating itself, the Sewol Ferry Act must be enacted.  We cannot let corruption and greed take any more
innocent lives. Our fight will continue until the Sewol Ferry Act proposed by the victims’ families gets enacted and justice is served to those who deserve it.</p>

They further testified of the pressure by the upper management and government coercing them to write biased reports favorable of the Blue House. The journalists at KBS eventually stood up against injustice, demanding rights to deliver objective journalism for the benefit of the public by going on a week-long strike. Coincidence?

<h3><b>세월호 100일, 진실은 침몰했습니다.</b></h3>
<p>구조를 기다리던 300여명의 아이들이 통째로 수장되었지만 100일이 지난 지금,
세월호가 침몰한 정확한 원인도 단 한명도 구조되지 못한 그 이유도 여전히 밝혀지지 않았습니다. 유가족들은 진상규명과 책임자처벌을 약속했던 대통령의 눈물을 믿고 기다렸지만 돌아온것은 유가족 사찰, 평화시위에 대한 폭력진압 뿐이었습니다. 모두가 떠난 팽목항에는 아직도 돌아오지못한
10명의 아이들을 기다리는 실종자 가족만이 남아 있습니다. 이에 우리는 정부와 여당이 국민과 유가족 기만을 즉각 중단하고 350만명이 서명한 유가족측 세월호 특별법을 수용해 제정할 것을 촉구합니다.
 </p>
<p>진실의 열쇠를 쥐고있을 선장도 언딘도 해경도 청와대도 모두 침묵으로 하나된 것 같습니다. 국정조사 특별 위원회가 열렸지만 관련 장관들은 무책임한 태도와 성의없는 답변으로 일관했고 여당의원들은 졸거나 오만한 자세로 특위에 임하며 유족들에게 막말을 하기도했습니다. 특위는 청와대에 207건의 자료를 요청했으나 제출자료는 7건에 그쳤고 최초 허위보도를한
MBC는 출석을 거부했습니다. 그러나 특위에서 일어나는 여당과 정부의 비상식적 대응을 주요방송 3사중 어느곳도 생방송으로 중계하지 않았고 뉴스로 다루지도않았습니다.</p>
<p>진상규명과 책임자처벌 그리고 참사없는 안전사회만들기를 내용으로 하는 유가족 측 세월호 특별법안은 위원회의 수사권, 기소권, 청문회소집권을 포함하고 있습니다. 수사권이없다면 특위에서처럼 진실을 밝히기가 어려울거고 기소권이 없다면 적절한 처벌을 기대할 수 없습니다. 그리고 청문회가 열리지 않는다면 특별법 조차도 그 과정이 언론에 보도되지 않을것 입니다.</p>
<p>세월호 참사 당일 박근혜대통령의 행방은 묘연합니다. 사고 직후 무려 7시간동안 대통령은 부재 상태였습니다. 구명조끼를 입고있는 학생들을 왜 구조하지 못하냐고 한 초등적 질문은 부재로 인해 사고에 대해 관심도 없고 보고도 제대로 받지 못했음을 반증합니다. 청문회를 통해 성역없는수사 그리고 국민이 공감할 수 있는 처벌과 사후대책이 뒤따라야 합니다. </p>
<p>유가족측은 의사자 지정도 특례입학도 아닌 오직 진정한 진상규명과 책임자 처벌만을 요구하고 있습니다.  현재 여당과 야당이 내놓은 특별법안은 제대로 된 수사도 처벌도 불가능하며 세월호와 같은 대형사고의 재발방지를 위한 대책마련도 빠져 있습니다. 우리는 특별하지도 않는 특별법, 아무효력도 없는 특별법이 아닌 진정한 기능과 권위를 가진 유가족 측 특별법안 채택을 촉구합니다. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/753544/files/20140730004822-10464015_1385125528415079_2285471181617439157_n.jpg?1406706502"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>첫째,
유가족 측 추천위원의 과반수 구성</b></p>
<p><b>둘째,
특별 위원회의 활동기간을 최장 3년으로 보장</b></p>
<p><b>셋째,
특별 위원회에 독립적 수사 및 기소권 보장</b></p>
<p><b>넷째,
참사 재발 방지 대책의 지속적 시행 보장</b></p>
<p>세월호참사 100일이 되던 날 5만명의 시민이 모여 특별법 제정을 촉구했지만 경찰의 폭행 진압외에 청와대에서는 아무런 답변이 없었습니다. </p>
<p>우리는 다시 한 번 해외교민의 힘을 모아 세월호 특별법 제정 촉구 광고 캠페인에 나섭니다. 많은 참여 바랍니다.</p>

</div></div>","A Campaign to Raise Funds for a Full-Page Ad Calling for a Global Support of the Sewol Ferry Act




On April 16th, the world watched as over 300
students helplessly lost their lives in the capsized ferry. 100 days have passed, yet we are still asking the same
question: Why was not ONE rescued?



President Park Geun-hye and the South Korean government have
failed once again to keep their promises for an investigation that will bring
answers to the question.  Their treatment
of the victims' families have been beyond inhumane since the disaster.  Instead of providing adequate support to the
families and helping them to heal from the trauma of losing their children, the
government took over their social media accounts and placed them under illegal
surveillance using undercover police. Members of President Park’s party spread
false rumors coloring the families as money-hungry revolts and communists in
attempts to manipulate public sentiment against them. While ten families are
still waiting to retrieve the bodies of their lost children, members of President
Park’s party have told the families to quit mourning and start moving on with life.
The riot police violently suppressed the families and supporters during peaceful march,
blocking them with walls of barricade and shooting them with
high-pressured water hose.


The families never asked for any monetary compensation or
even medical help. The only thing they have been seeking since Day 1 was the truth – why was a disaster like this even allowed in the first place, and
why weren’t any of their children saved? 



The families soon realized that their trust in the tears of President Park shed in front of the cameras were lost in vain. They started a
rally demanding a special legislation to be enacted. The ""Sewol Ferry Act,"" which will involve independent and thorough investigation of the disaster with prosecution of those who are responsible, will serve as groundwork to finally putting
an end to disasters caused by governmental corruption and corporate greed prevalent in South Korea.  It will also
serve as a corner stone to building a solid plan that will prevent future
disasters like Sewol.

The Elements of Sewol Ferry Act -- proposed by the families of the victims

1. Form a Special Committee that the families of the victims and public can trust:  8 members elected by the congress and 8 members elected by the group representing the families2. Guarantee an adequate time (up to 3 years) for the Special Committee to carry out a thorough investigation, prosecution and construction of a plan to prevent future disasters3. Form technical subcommittees within the Special Committee:       a. Independent Investigation Committee     b. Safety Planning and Disaster Prevention Committee     c. Commemoration Committee4. Guaranteed rights to investigate and prosecute to be exercised by the Special Committee:  Without these two rights, a thorough investigation and prevention offuture disasters will not be made possible5. Guaranteed implementation and enforcement of Disaster Prevention Plan:       a. The Committee submits the Plan to the congress     b. Related agencies periodically submit reports of the status of implementation to the congress    c. If not followed through, the responsible agencies and personnel  receive disciplinary retribution 
What the families are asking only makes sense. What they are
asking is not much. But for some reason, it seems to be too big of a pill for the Park
Geun-hye administration to swallow. You can't help but wonder, what are they so
afraid of?
In today’s global society where close to one million
foreigners live in South Korea, of which 120,000 are Americans, the lack of public safety due to government's negligence and corruption is not only their problem, but our
problem.  In order to make a safer
society and prevent history from repeating itself, the Sewol Ferry Act must be enacted.  We cannot let corruption and greed take any more
innocent lives. Our fight will continue until the Sewol Ferry Act proposed by the victims’ families gets enacted and justice is served to those who deserve it.



Your Voice Through Our Ad is Powerful In case you're not aware, this is our second Indiegogo campaign and if successful, we'll be able to place a third (and hopefully fourth) full-page ad(s) in major American newspapers.  You can find our first Indiegogo campaign and our two published ads here: Our Previous Indiegogo Campaign
Following the release of our ads in the New York Times and the Washington Post, which received much publicity in Korea, numerous journalists at KBS and MBC (public broadcasting companies in SK) came out confessing of their involvement in the fabricated coverage of the ferry accident. They further testified of the pressure by the upper management and government coercing them to write biased reports favorable of the Blue House. The journalists at KBS eventually stood up against injustice, demanding rights to deliver objective journalism for the benefit of the public by going on a week-long strike. Coincidence? We think not. 



[KBS Journalists on strike apologizing for their failed journalism and demanding right to deliver objective news to the public]
[Citizens gathered in Seoul for a rally to support the Sewol Ferry Act]
We want to keep the momentum going. We seek to make a difference -- a history that will finally put an end to the man-made disasters so prevalent in Korea. And we invite YOU to be a part of it.

What You Can Expect
If we reach our initial goal of $58,273 (the cost of placing a full-page black & white ad plus transaction fees), we will place a full-page ad in one of the major newspapers in the U.S. that will call for a global support to petition for the Sewol Ferry Act.  
If we double or triple our funding goal like we did in our initial campaign, we will use the remainder funds to place subsequent ads with different contents that will continue to pressure the South Korean government.
If we have leftover funds after the ad(s), we will select an independent news company and donate the funds as we did in the first campaign.
Finally, as we did with our first campaign, we will be transparent with the use of the funds and post screen shots on the Updates for your reference. 

Other Ways You Can Help
 It's totally fine if you cannot support us financially. Your words still matter as much, if not more. Please spread the word through Facebook, Twitter, and other social media outlets. Share this link with your friends and family:  http://igg.me/at/SewolFerryAct

==========================================================


세월호 100일, 진실은 침몰했습니다.
구조를 기다리던 300여명의 아이들이 통째로 수장되었지만 100일이 지난 지금,
세월호가 침몰한 정확한 원인도 단 한명도 구조되지 못한 그 이유도 여전히 밝혀지지 않았습니다. 유가족들은 진상규명과 책임자처벌을 약속했던 대통령의 눈물을 믿고 기다렸지만 돌아온것은 유가족 사찰, 평화시위에 대한 폭력진압 뿐이었습니다. 모두가 떠난 팽목항에는 아직도 돌아오지못한
10명의 아이들을 기다리는 실종자 가족만이 남아 있습니다. 이에 우리는 정부와 여당이 국민과 유가족 기만을 즉각 중단하고 350만명이 서명한 유가족측 세월호 특별법을 수용해 제정할 것을 촉구합니다.
 
진실의 열쇠를 쥐고있을 선장도 언딘도 해경도 청와대도 모두 침묵으로 하나된 것 같습니다. 국정조사 특별 위원회가 열렸지만 관련 장관들은 무책임한 태도와 성의없는 답변으로 일관했고 여당의원들은 졸거나 오만한 자세로 특위에 임하며 유족들에게 막말을 하기도했습니다. 특위는 청와대에 207건의 자료를 요청했으나 제출자료는 7건에 그쳤고 최초 허위보도를한
MBC는 출석을 거부했습니다. 그러나 특위에서 일어나는 여당과 정부의 비상식적 대응을 주요방송 3사중 어느곳도 생방송으로 중계하지 않았고 뉴스로 다루지도않았습니다.
진상규명과 책임자처벌 그리고 참사없는 안전사회만들기를 내용으로 하는 유가족 측 세월호 특별법안은 위원회의 수사권, 기소권, 청문회소집권을 포함하고 있습니다. 수사권이없다면 특위에서처럼 진실을 밝히기가 어려울거고 기소권이 없다면 적절한 처벌을 기대할 수 없습니다. 그리고 청문회가 열리지 않는다면 특별법 조차도 그 과정이 언론에 보도되지 않을것 입니다.
세월호 참사 당일 박근혜대통령의 행방은 묘연합니다. 사고 직후 무려 7시간동안 대통령은 부재 상태였습니다. 구명조끼를 입고있는 학생들을 왜 구조하지 못하냐고 한 초등적 질문은 부재로 인해 사고에 대해 관심도 없고 보고도 제대로 받지 못했음을 반증합니다. 청문회를 통해 성역없는수사 그리고 국민이 공감할 수 있는 처벌과 사후대책이 뒤따라야 합니다. 
유가족측은 의사자 지정도 특례입학도 아닌 오직 진정한 진상규명과 책임자 처벌만을 요구하고 있습니다.  현재 여당과 야당이 내놓은 특별법안은 제대로 된 수사도 처벌도 불가능하며 세월호와 같은 대형사고의 재발방지를 위한 대책마련도 빠져 있습니다. 우리는 특별하지도 않는 특별법, 아무효력도 없는 특별법이 아닌 진정한 기능과 권위를 가진 유가족 측 특별법안 채택을 촉구합니다. 

첫째,
유가족 측 추천위원의 과반수 구성
둘째,
특별 위원회의 활동기간을 최장 3년으로 보장
셋째,
특별 위원회에 독립적 수사 및 기소권 보장
넷째,
참사 재발 방지 대책의 지속적 시행 보장
세월호참사 100일이 되던 날 5만명의 시민이 모여 특별법 제정을 촉구했지만 경찰의 폭행 진압외에 청와대에서는 아무런 답변이 없었습니다. 
우리는 다시 한 번 해외교민의 힘을 모아 세월호 특별법 제정 촉구 광고 캠페인에 나섭니다. 많은 참여 바랍니다.

*** 성공리에 마친 1차 인디고고 캠페인과 NYT, WP 에 실린 광고를 보시려면 여기를 클릭하세요: 1차 인디고고 캠페인
1차때와 마찬가지로 목표금액을 도달하면 미국 주력 일간지에 전세계인들로 부터 세월호 특별법 제정을 위한 서명운동을 촉구하는 광고가 나갈것 입니다.  만약 저희가 1차때 처럼 목표금액의 세배를 넘는 금액이 모금이 된다면 한국 정부를 압박할 2차 3차의 새로운 광고들을 내보낼것 입니다. 이번 모금은 최대한 광고에 이용될 것 입니다. 광고를 다 하고 더이상 광고를 낼 수 없을만큼의 잔액이 남는다면 양심언론사 한곳을 지정해서 기부할것입니다.
마지막으로 1차때와 마찬가지로 자금정리는 스크린샷을 통해 후원자분들에게 투명한 공개를 하겠습니다.

</h3><p>My name is Cassandra Wind, and I’m a single mother of three,
a certified acupuncturist and massage therapist, and owner of Wind Sports &amp;
Wellness in Milwaukee, WI. I’ve practiced both Eastern and Western Medicine for
over 25 years, first as a nuclear medicine technologist, and more recently
after receiving my masters in Oriental Medicine from the Midwest College of Oriental Medicine, with an internship at the University of
Traditional Chinese Medicine in Guangzhau, China. My personal and professional
mission is to create an environment where people are comfortable integrating
both Eastern and Western practices and traditions into a balanced, healthy
lifestyle. I work with many adults who suffer from symptoms like pain, skin
conditions, allergies, obesity and weight issues, digestive complaints, fatigue,
headaches and more. Often I think to myself, wouldn’t it be wonderful if we
were able to get to the root of these conditions earlier, and treat them when
they are less severe? This is why I’m seeking to publish my book, <u>Ancient
Teachings – New Traditions</u>, and establish a workbook and toolkit to guide
parents through one of the most important transitions in a girl’s life. </p>
<p>I believe that in traditional western society, we often
overlook the magnitude of the time when a girl physically begins her transition
into womanhood. As adults, we are anxious and even embarrassed to discuss the
physical changes that occur, and it’s even more difficult to figure out how to
guide our daughters and shape them into the loving, secure, confident adults we
hope they’ll become. My book offers a simple guide and user-friendly tools to help
you approach your daughter’s coming of age in a different, gentler way. I use
ancient traditions from cultures across the globe to inspire practices that any
family can replicate to create a positive, safe environment for their girl(s)
to grow into women. </p>
<p>I believe that this book and the tools that surround it can
impact the next generation of women in America and beyond. It is our
responsibility to give our girls the tools they need to lead a healthy,
well-adjusted life. <u>Ancient Teachings – New Traditions</u> offers a guide to
help us get back to the sacred coming-of-age practices that provide support,
guidance, and the nurturing that our girls need in order to be successful,
healthy adults. </p>
<p><b>Our Request &amp; Your Investment: </b></p>
<p>I am seeking $25,000 in funding for this project. The
breakdown of those dollars includes: </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>$5,000 for editing and producing the e-book, paperback, and workbook</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>$8,000 for producing the accompanying Treasure
Chest for mass distribution</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>$2,000 for scholarships to my overnight
Mother-Daughter retreats which include the book, workbook, and Treasure Chest</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>$10,000 for Marketing and advertising related to
the release of the e-book, paperback, workbook, and treasure chest</p>
<p>My perks include first-releases of <u>Ancient Teachings –
New Traditions</u> autographed by my daughter, Sage, the inspiration for the
entire project and myself. At higher levels, I invite contributors to connect
with me on a more personal level, through informal one-on-one meetings, formal
health and wellness consultations, and at my Mother-Daughter overnight retreat.
And at the highest levels of giving, I invite my sponsors to include their name
or business name on the published version of the book, and to help develop the
Treasure Chest component of the package. The Treasure Chest will be a vessel designed
to accompany the book and workbook, filled with the things that helped Sage and
I through her transition into adulthood. </p>
<p>If I don’t achieve my $25,000 goal, my first priority is to
develop and publish the e-book and paperback versions of <u>Ancient Teachings –
New Traditions</u>, releasing them to the public in 2015. I can provide
guidance through my website and public speaking engagements until the time when
I can publish the workbook and develop the Treasure Chest. </p>
<p><b>You Have a Huge Impact! </b></p>
<p>Every person who helps to fund <u>Ancient Teachings – New
Traditions</u> is taking responsibility for the next generation of women.
Whether you have a daughter, niece, Goddaughter, neighbor kid, or just want to
see a healthier, happier generation of girls, you are in the right place. By teaching
parents, teachers, counselors, and all youth service providers to use the
wisdom of past generations across many cultures, we can change our society, and
change the world. </p>
<p><b>Our Challenge: </b></p>
<p>The real risk in this project is creating something that
doesn’t reach the people who need it, which is why I’ve built in a marketing

<br/></div>","My name is Cassandra Wind, and I’m a single mother of three,
a certified acupuncturist and massage therapist, and owner of Wind Sports &
Wellness in Milwaukee, WI. I’ve practiced both Eastern and Western Medicine for
over 25 years, first as a nuclear medicine technologist, and more recently
after receiving my masters in Oriental Medicine from the Midwest College of Oriental Medicine, with an internship at the University of
Traditional Chinese Medicine in Guangzhau, China. My personal and professional
mission is to create an environment where people are comfortable integrating
both Eastern and Western practices and traditions into a balanced, healthy
lifestyle. I work with many adults who suffer from symptoms like pain, skin
conditions, allergies, obesity and weight issues, digestive complaints, fatigue,
headaches and more. Often I think to myself, wouldn’t it be wonderful if we
were able to get to the root of these conditions earlier, and treat them when
they are less severe? This is why I’m seeking to publish my book, Ancient
Teachings – New Traditions, and establish a workbook and toolkit to guide
parents through one of the most important transitions in a girl’s life. 
I believe that in traditional western society, we often
overlook the magnitude of the time when a girl physically begins her transition
into womanhood. As adults, we are anxious and even embarrassed to discuss the
physical changes that occur, and it’s even more difficult to figure out how to
guide our daughters and shape them into the loving, secure, confident adults we
hope they’ll become. My book offers a simple guide and user-friendly tools to help
you approach your daughter’s coming of age in a different, gentler way. I use
ancient traditions from cultures across the globe to inspire practices that any
family can replicate to create a positive, safe environment for their girl(s)
to grow into women. 
I believe that this book and the tools that surround it can
impact the next generation of women in America and beyond. It is our
responsibility to give our girls the tools they need to lead a healthy,
well-adjusted life. Ancient Teachings – New Traditions offers a guide to
help us get back to the sacred coming-of-age practices that provide support,
guidance, and the nurturing that our girls need in order to be successful,
healthy adults. 
Our Request & Your Investment: 
I am seeking $25,000 in funding for this project. The
breakdown of those dollars includes: 
· 
$5,000 for editing and producing the e-book, paperback, and workbook
· 
$8,000 for producing the accompanying Treasure
Chest for mass distribution
· 
$2,000 for scholarships to my overnight
Mother-Daughter retreats which include the book, workbook, and Treasure Chest
· 
$10,000 for Marketing and advertising related to
the release of the e-book, paperback, workbook, and treasure chest
My perks include first-releases of Ancient Teachings –
New Traditions autographed by my daughter, Sage, the inspiration for the
entire project and myself. At higher levels, I invite contributors to connect
with me on a more personal level, through informal one-on-one meetings, formal
health and wellness consultations, and at my Mother-Daughter overnight retreat.
And at the highest levels of giving, I invite my sponsors to include their name
or business name on the published version of the book, and to help develop the
Treasure Chest component of the package. The Treasure Chest will be a vessel designed
to accompany the book and workbook, filled with the things that helped Sage and
I through her transition into adulthood. 
If I don’t achieve my $25,000 goal, my first priority is to
develop and publish the e-book and paperback versions of Ancient Teachings –
New Traditions, releasing them to the public in 2015. I can provide
guidance through my website and public speaking engagements until the time when
I can publish the workbook and develop the Treasure Chest. 
You Have a Huge Impact! 
Every person who helps to fund Ancient Teachings – New
Traditions is taking responsibility for the next generation of women.
Whether you have a daughter, niece, Goddaughter, neighbor kid, or just want to
see a healthier, happier generation of girls, you are in the right place. By teaching
parents, teachers, counselors, and all youth service providers to use the
wisdom of past generations across many cultures, we can change our society, and
change the world. 
Our Challenge: 
The real risk in this project is creating something that
doesn’t reach the people who need it, which is why I’ve built in a marketing
and advertising budget for Ancient Teachings – New Traditions. Once the
book and accompanying tools are developed and produced, the real key will be to
distribute it widely and champion its use across the U.S. and beyond. You have
my personal commitment that once we’ve got the tools in place, I will take
every opportunity to teach real people how to use it, champion it’s use both
locally and nationally, and bring it to people who may not be able to purchase
it through my retreat scholarship program.

girls become loving, secure, confident women, and are unable to contribute
financially, there are many ways that you can help this movement:

<h3>Parents Need Support</h3>
<p>When I was diagnosed with a life-altering illness, there was no manual about what my parents could expect. They didn't know how to answer questions about my own fate, they didn't know how to deal with me not wanting to take care of myself, or how to give me a quality life that I would be proud of. Luckily, my parents are superheros, and they did the best they could, and I turned out just fine. Now, I feel it is my duty to pass along the secret ways they gave me a quality life, which lead to an adulthood where I am healthy and happy.  It is so important that I share my story so that parents of kids with illnesses like mine can feel prepared and comforted that they GOT this! And for the kids, this book will allow them to live a life with less fear and more laughter. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>I'm asking for funds to help pay for the editing and publishing costs of this book. </p>
<ul>

<li>Any donation of $20 will get you your very own copy of the book, or a donation to a parent. For $10 more, you'll get a copy AND one will be sent to a hospital to be distributed to parents who will benefit. If you become a Top Contributor, you will not only receive a copy and have one sent to a hospital, but I will also publish your name in the acknowledgements of the book for your generosity. </li>
<li>If I don't reach my goal, the funds will be used to off-set the costs of publishing. </li>

<li>Kids of these parents will benefit when they learn how to take care of themselves, and live a quality life without limitations</li>

</h4><h3>
<b>Shanto’s Meeting with Maya </b><b>–</b> and the Birth of a Book<br/>
</h3>
<p>In the end of June 2013, Shanto moved out of
his home in Sweden – with nowhere to move in. He drove to the mountains of
southern France, where he met up with his family of tantrikas. Two intense and
mind-blowing weeks later, he spent <b>an open-air night in a vineyard</b> together
with two Dutch women, who were like him on their way home. Bats flying only
centimeters over their faces didn’t disturb the peacefulness of this full moon
night. It merely added to the magic of their journey – home.</p>
<h4><i>But where was his home – for the future?</i></h4>
<p>After a short stay in the Netherlands, Shanto
returned to Sweden for three weeks of taking care of business, and seeing
friends. He started to think about where to move in after this summer on the
road – and his mind went blank. The past three years, he had spent living alone
in a forest cottage; cherishing the silence, chopping firewood, shoveling snow,
and watching roe-deer munching fallen apples in the garden.</p>
<p>During this time he had seen his ghostwriter business
grow <b>from zero to successful</b>, but now the page had been turned. It was time to
start a new chapter. The cottage he had been renting was up for sale, and his
“writing behind the scenes” business didn’t completely satisfy him anymore.</p>
<p>The only thing that came to mind when envisioning his next home, were 
some comments made by the two Dutch tantrikas during their road trip 
northwards. Those were comments about upcoming events and possibilities
in the Netherlands, along with playful suggestions that he should make his home
there – so much closer to most of the people of his <b>beloved tantric family</b>.</p>
<p>It did sound appealing. The idea of it did
touch his heart. But was it not sheer madness; irresponsible dreaming? He could
not prolong his holidays for an indefinite period of time – could he? He needed
a new home, and even though he was between assignments, he could not just give
up his ghostwriting business – could he?</p><h4><i><b>And then the idea came…</b></i></h4>
<p>He would write a book – with his own name on
the cover! The two Dutch women would be in it – as would the other people of his
tantric family. Focusing on this idea, the prospect of returning to the
Netherlands immediately took on a new quality: from irresponsible whim to the
only possible continuation of <b>the journey of his heart</b>.</p>
<p>Letting this new project put him in motion, he
hit the southbound road again. The first interview started to unfold with the
person in whose home he was a guest, in Utrecht. And then the second portrait
of a tantrika of his family started to emerge in his manuscript… </p>
<p>The work was now in progress; he was
interviewing his brothers and sisters in the ‘Kaula’, the tantric family where
he felt so deeply at home. He spent August and September in this way, moving
from friend to friend in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>And then, one day, he was <b>offered to rent an
apartment</b> – in Utrecht! From the first of November.</p>
<p>His heart said YES – so what did it matter that
he had by now lived up all his savings, and had no money whatsoever to pay the
rent?</p>
<p>Once again, he returned to Sweden for a few
weeks, to prepare for the moving of himself and his business: From being a
ghostwriter in Sweden to being a writer in the Netherlands. From being paid by his
customers, to writing with the joy of the heart as the only payment.</p>
<p>Having sold his furniture, his bicycle, his old
printer, and whatever little things he could let go of, he moved in in the
Utrecht apartment. Looking for the odd job, and gratefully receiving some
economical support from friends, he kept financing his writing and living in
his new home – where a happy bunch of green naturalized parrots would often
play around just outside his third floor window. </p><h4><i><b>And then, one day… he met Maya!</b></i></h4>
<p>A lover always knows his beloved in the moment
he meets her, doesn’t he?</p>
<p>In the meeting with Maya, lies the deepest home
Shanto has ever known together with a woman. On the 10<sup>th</sup> of January,
Shanto and Maya <b>entered a ‘Tantric Marriage’</b> for a year to come.</p>
<p>In a Tantric Marriage, divorce is not an option
– it is designed for the growing together, no matter what is brought up within and
between the two partners. And many juicy, yummy fruits can for sure come out of
such a commitment. In the marriage of Maya and Shanto, a book – <b>‘Maya – Child
Of The Earth’</b> – is one of the fruits that immediately started to grow. <br/></p><p>It just happened like that. This Book came sailing by, and there was no 
other option than to jump aboard - joyously shouting laughter-filled 
prayers to the wind...<br/></p><p><i>What can be said about this book? Well, let’s first state clearly what
it is not: it is not a biography; it is not a chronological account of one
woman’s life. Far from it! It is an open exploration; an innocent journey into
the multidimensional space of human experience; a mirror where each and every one
of us may recognize their own face – its darkness and its light. It is a free
fall through the labyrinth of memory; it is a wild encounter with the rawness
of being alive on this earth; it is a curious inquiry into the unknown face of
Existence Itself… <i>It is a book in the making, and as every truly creative project it is a journey into the unknown.</i><br/></i></p>

two books graciously cross-fertilize each other in his busy writer’s life. </i>[<b>Update 5 Feb</b>: Shanto has chosen to put 'The Seeds Of Tantra' project on hold, as the work of creating and funding 'Maya - Child Of The Earth' currently takes all his time.

<h3><b>When Will You Have The Book In
Your Hand?</b></h3>
<p>Shanto and
Maya’s Tantric Marriage ends on the 10<sup>th</sup> of January 2015 (at which
time it can be prolonged, should they so wish). They see this book as a fruit
of their marriage, and so they have decided that the manuscript will be completed
well before the 10<sup>th</sup> of January 2015.</p>
<p>They
have also decided that an e-book version will be made available before the 10<sup>th</sup>
of January 2015.</p>
<p>Exactly
when you can lay your hands on a printed copy of the book, is currently not
possible to say. It depends on the publishing process.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>A Word on Crowdfunding</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Normally
we go out there, into the marketplace we call ‘the world’, searching among
everything on offer. We spend our hard-earned money on what we feel will
fulfill our needs – in terms of health, pleasure and entertainment. We act as passive
consumers.</p>
<p><span></span>Yet,
there is also another way: we can take part in creating what we want to have in
our world. We can search in the world of initiatives that precedes the world of
the marketplace. <b><span>Indiegogo</span></b> is such a world of initiatives. Here you can
browse any number of creative projects, in search of the ones your heart wants
to support. And by so doing, you start to act as an active consumer – and even
a co-creator! </p>
<p><b>By donating to crowdfunded
projects, such as this one, you actively influence which initiatives will bear
fruit in the world. With a few clicks of your mouse, you can become a ‘midwife’
of books, films, and art projects that would never have had the chance to make
it into the world without you.</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>A Word on Tantra</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Piglet: “How
do you spell 'love'?”</p>
<p>Winnie
The Pooh: “You don't spell it... you feel it.”</p>
<p>This quote
from the world of Winnie The Pooh, has something to say about tantra too. You
can read up on the Indian and Tibetan roots of tantra, trying to ‘spell it out’
– but will it give you a true understanding of tantra? No. It is with tantra as
it is with love: you feel it, you experience it, you live it…</p>
<p>What is
a Tantric Marriage? Well, apparently it is a union which can give birth to a
book called ‘Maya – Child Of The Earth’…</p>
<p>Are you
curious beyond that? Then maybe look for ways to have your own experience of tantra. Here,
for starters, is a link to <b><span></span></b><span><a href=""http://www.wildtantra.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Wild Tantra</a></span><b><span></span></b>.<a href=""http://www.wildtantra.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.wildtantra.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a> </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>A Word on the Child of the
Earth – the Insect<br/></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>One
evening, Maya showed one of her favorite movies to Shanto, <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYM60YOczIU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">La Belle Verte</a>. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYM60YOczIU"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<p></p>
<p>After watching the movie, Shanto felt touched, and a phrase flashed 
up in his mind: ‘Child Of The Earth’. He googled it, and found… <b>an insect</b>! It turned out that insects of the genus <i>Stenopelmatus</i>, are known by the name <b>child of the earth</b> – as well as several other names, such as Jerusalem cricket and potato bug.</p>
In a conversation between Shanto and Maya in a bathhouse a couple of 
days later, the phrase ‘Child Of The Earth’ merged with the idea of 
creating a book out of their meeting. Ever since, this little bug is 
invited into the ongoing creation of the book – as a guest with unknown 
significance… And as the project mascot. :-)<br/><p><b></b></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/353939/files/20140206142352-Earth-the-universe-stars-435.jpg?1391725432"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>

The work will be resumed whenever possible - and there is even a vision that 'The Seeds Of Tantra' project may transform into a film...]
And it all happens without economical resources.
Please consider helping Shanto and Maya to sail
their book project into its harbor, by contributing a sum of money. They will
be forever grateful to you, and you will be personally thanked in the book –
which can only be born into this world thanks to your contribution.
With love,
Maya and ShantoThe insect 'Child Of The Earth' (genus Stenopelmatus), also known as 'Jerusalem cricket', or 'potato bug'.What Will Your Contribution Be
Doing?
Your
contribution will make it possible for Shanto to finance his new life as a (non-ghost)
writer, in the time period of February – December 2014.
Rent of writer’s
accommodation: 5720 euro
Telephone & Internet costs: 880 euro
Travel costs: 1960 euro
Living expenses (food, personal
services, etc): 3250 euro
Fund raising costs: 690 euro
Contingencies: 500 euro
  
What Do You Get?

Above all, you
get the chance to read the book! 
This book
depends on your contribution for its birth into the world. 
By
donating to our campaign, you become its co-creator. And as such, you are
cherished deep within the hearts of Maya and Shanto. Thank you!
Every
contributor to this book project will be personally thanked in the book.

addition, you will be rewarded for your contribution according to how much you
contribute. See the list of perks! ***


Who is Shanto, the Author of
‘Maya - Child Of The Earth’?
To find
out, please, visit the official website of Shanto’s ghostwriting business,
available in English and Swedish.
Still
have questions? Please, feel free to send an e-mail to Shanto with any questions you may have – or ideas, suggestions or feedback.

When Will You Have The Book In
Your Hand?
Shanto and
Maya’s Tantric Marriage ends on the 10th of January 2015 (at which
time it can be prolonged, should they so wish). They see this book as a fruit
of their marriage, and so they have decided that the manuscript will be completed
well before the 10th of January 2015.
They
have also decided that an e-book version will be made available before the 10th
of January 2015.
Exactly
when you can lay your hands on a printed copy of the book, is currently not
possible to say. It depends on the publishing process.

A Word on Crowdfunding

Normally
we go out there, into the marketplace we call ‘the world’, searching among
everything on offer. We spend our hard-earned money on what we feel will
fulfill our needs – in terms of health, pleasure and entertainment. We act as passive
consumers.
Yet,
there is also another way: we can take part in creating what we want to have in
our world. We can search in the world of initiatives that precedes the world of
the marketplace. Indiegogo is such a world of initiatives. Here you can
browse any number of creative projects, in search of the ones your heart wants
to support. And by so doing, you start to act as an active consumer – and even
a co-creator! 
By donating to crowdfunded
projects, such as this one, you actively influence which initiatives will bear
fruit in the world. With a few clicks of your mouse, you can become a ‘midwife’
of books, films, and art projects that would never have had the chance to make
it into the world without you.

A Word on Tantra

Piglet: “How
do you spell 'love'?”
Winnie
The Pooh: “You don't spell it... you feel it.”
This quote
from the world of Winnie The Pooh, has something to say about tantra too. You
can read up on the Indian and Tibetan roots of tantra, trying to ‘spell it out’
– but will it give you a true understanding of tantra? No. It is with tantra as
it is with love: you feel it, you experience it, you live it…
What is
a Tantric Marriage? Well, apparently it is a union which can give birth to a
book called ‘Maya – Child Of The Earth’…
Are you
curious beyond that? Then maybe look for ways to have your own experience of tantra. Here,
for starters, is a link to Wild Tantra. 

A Word on the Child of the
Earth – the Insect

One
evening, Maya showed one of her favorite movies to Shanto, La Belle Verte. 

After watching the movie, Shanto felt touched, and a phrase flashed 
up in his mind: ‘Child Of The Earth’. He googled it, and found… an insect! It turned out that insects of the genus Stenopelmatus, are known by the name child of the earth – as well as several other names, such as Jerusalem cricket and potato bug.
In a conversation between Shanto and Maya in a bathhouse a couple of 
days later, the phrase ‘Child Of The Earth’ merged with the idea of 
creating a book out of their meeting. Ever since, this little bug is 
invited into the ongoing creation of the book – as a guest with unknown 
significance… And as the project mascot. :-)
We hope you're enjoying being a Child Of The Earth! Thank you for being here - with us!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>HELLO</b></p>
<p>Welcome to our Indiegogo
crowdfunding page. Please have a look at our video and read the information
below to learn about our project and its beneficiaries. We hope you will help
us realise our ambition and bring our project to life. </p>
<p><b>WHAT WE ARE TRYING
TO DO</b></p>
<p>We (the Afghanistan and Central
Asian Association) will hold a one-day conference in London at the end of
January to examine the future of Afghanistan post-2014, the year of the Afghan
elections and the deadline for the withdrawal of international troops. We have
invited a number of high-profile guests representing political, academic and
humanitarian fields, as well as our membership network of Afghan people living
in the UK and Europe. Throughout the day we will hold panel discussions on the electoral
process, the position of human rights and women in Afghanistan, and the role of
the diaspora in the growth of a democratic society.</p>
<p>While there have been plenty of
events on post-2014 Afghanistan, most have been exclusively political or
academic. The most important and exciting thing about our event is that we are
trying to give the Afghan people living in Europe and the UK the opportunity to
put their questions and suggestions to politicians and experts. These people,
many of whom have come here as refugees and asylum seekers, need to be heard
and represented. They need to have a stake in the future of their own country,
to which many wish to return when conditions permit. </p>
<p>The UK has been involved in
Afghanistan since 2001 primarily in a military capacity. With the departure of
troops at the end of 2014, many inside Afghanistan are worried not just about
the implications for security and the possible resurgence of the Taliban, but
also the massive decline in foreign aid which will follow. By holding our event
at a UK university and inviting students to learn about Afghanistan, we want to
make an example of the kind of support which will be invaluable in
strengthening Afghan civil society in the future. We want to empower Afghans
living here, show that we support their participation in the post-2014
political settlement, and give them hope that they will not be forgotten after
the departure of troops.</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></p>
<p>We are able to put on this unique
event because of the efforts of our staff and volunteers. We are not requesting
funding for any aspect of the organisational process. What we need your help
for is the costs during the day itself.</p>
<p>In recognition of our charitable
efforts in South-East London, we have kindly been offered a venue by Goldsmiths,
University of London free of charge. But such an event carries numerous other
logistical costs. </p>
<p>As a base, we need to raise £1500 to
cover the costs of catering and promotion. With our team of volunteers, we will
buy food and cook for the 200 guests we expect to attend the conference. We
will be able to serve a hot lunch and provide tea and coffee during breaks.
Funds allocated to promotion will go towards the cost of advertisement and the
printing costs of literature on the day. </p>
<p>If we go beyond our target any
additional funds will go towards the travel expenses of some of our speakers,
enabling us to attract important voices that might not otherwise be able to
contribute, as well as arranging transport for Afghan community members. We
would also look to secure journalists and well-known commentators to chair our
panels, as well as a camera team to film the conference so that we can upload a
video to be viewed in Afghanistan and around the world. Every extra pound we
raise will make this event better and make a real contribution towards the
empowerment of the Afghan people.</p>

human rights abuse, advance education and unite the Afghan diaspora across
Europe in the promotion of human rights and democracy. The campaign has 200

the idea</b></h3>
<p>In the
English visual novel community (message boards such as Fuwanovel forums and few
other smaller communities) I am mostly known for my long posts full of both
passion and philosophy, touching all sorts of topics. From discussions about
the meaning of love and friendship through debates about law and the world
order to abstract talks about perception of reality and its impact on our mind.</p>
<p>And that is where this project idea originated. I am often labeled as delusional, thinking that the 2-dimensional<sup>*</sup>
 world is reality, spreading love towards characters from games, anime 
and manga and spending lot of time with said characters in my daydreams 
and fantasies. This strong imagination is however often praised and I have
been told many times that people would love to read more of the stories
happening in my mind. And so I would like to fulfill my dream and make
writing my profession to share my fantasy worlds with others and to improve
creating and describing them.</p>
<p><i>*<b>2d vs 3d</b>: in manga slang
these terms are used to distinguish the anime/manga world (2d) and the real
world (3d). </i></p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3><b>The
story </b></h3>
<p>These are the genres you can expect to be touched in the story:<br/></p><i>Romance, Post-Apocalyptic World, Mystery, Fantasy, Drama, Science Fiction, Alternative
Dimensions, Dreams<br/></i><br/><p>Premise of the story:<br/><br/>
Hundreds of years after a nuclear apocalypse, the few survivors living in
underground bunkers were able to continue the human legacy. Nobody was however
able to rebuild what was once destroyed - that being hope for peace,
technological progress and other great deeds that people before the war were
striving to achieve.<br/><br/>
Yukirou used to live in one of these bunkers. But just like people fought
during the war, people these days still fight the same way. And even though the
ideals they are fighting for might have changed over the centuries, the main
reasons for fighting remain the same - greed, lust for power, desire to control
others.<br/>
And so during his childhood, after a riot caused a series of malfunctions
resulting in a full lockdown and large fire spreading throughout the bunker,
he was forced to escape using a secret shaft only a young and agile boy like
him could fit through, leaving behind everyone he knew and loved.<br/><br/>
Thrown into the outside world full of dangerous animals and people (often times
very hard to distinguish the two apart), he soon met a mysterious girl. Introducing
herself as Chiiko, she started addressing Yukirou as onii-chan<sup>*</sup>,
despite this being the first time he met her. To Yukirou she almost seemed like a
gift from gods to guide him through the hell he must explore.<br/><br/>
And so he ventured towards the future, towards all the mysteries of this land
that he is slowly discovering to be very different from what he was taught.
Perhaps the world is not what it seems to be. Hopefully Chiiko will have the
answers for him when the time to ask the questions comes.<br/><br/><i>*<b>onii-chan</b> is a Japanese term younger sisters use to call their older
brothers, honorific -chan often signifies close relationship.</i>
</p><p><b><span><br/></span></b></p><h3><b><span>Format and style<br/></span></b></h3>
<p>Light novels are Japanese style of novel associated with the anime and manga culture, often receiving adaptations in those media. The characters in them are described (and often illustrated) in the 2d manga style with the romantic novels including cute girls with whom the readers often fall in love (this can be described using a Japanese term ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moe_%28slang%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">moe</a>"").<br/></p><p>Visual novels (English term) are in Japan known mostly as ""eroge"" (erotic game) or just game (for non-erotic ones) and are a style of often interactive novels with visual representation of the characters on the screen. Most of the time focused on romance between the protagonist and the heroines in the story, they use very immersive first person style to make the reader feel like they are experiencing these stories themselves, together with the cute girls.</p><p>As a result, the mixture of these 2 kinds of media I plan to put in use will be mainly focused on the immersion aspect. The story will be told in first person present tense to let the reader become the protagonist himself and experience the events the moment they happen, instead of being told a story after it has concluded like in regular novels. The main focus will therefore be on the dialogues between the characters, internal monologue of the protagonist, his thoughts and description of the world and events from his point of view. Action scenes and fighting scenes will be very rare, if there is any fight to be had, it will be a mental fight with an inner self, a fight to overcome the obstacles the world puts between Yukirou and his goal, a fight to not give up.<br/></p><p>There will be no erotic content in this book as I am not yet fully familiar with publishing of such works and I want to reach to as wide audience as possible, including younger students seeking romantic stories with lots of deep thoughts.</p><p>The level of English I plan to use should be fairly easy to read for everyone who is used to reading visual novel or light novel translations. The vocabulary used will be mostly simple so even not native English readers can enjoy it.<br/>
The philosophical ideas behind the world are going to be the main focus of the writing.<br/>Instead of pondering about the meaning of a confusing word, you will be pondering about the meaning of a confusing world.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Sample<br/>
</h3><p>To have a pretty good idea how my style of writing looks like, you can check the prologue and second part of chapter 1. It is still work in progress and some things might change for the final release.</p>Prologue (3 pages) - <a href=""https://googledrive.com/host/0BylWuAJokVXMQmhIaU1rNnJVREE/bw_prologue.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">View PDF in browser</a> | <a href=""https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=0BylWuAJokVXMWkYtU0FXWFpWVTQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Download PDF</a><br/>

<li>Very basic living expenses</li>
<li>Fees related to the funding - that includes indiegogo fees and Paypal transfer fees</li>

</ul><br/><br/><h3><b>Future of the series<br/></b></h3>The story doesn't end here! I actually have a pretty good idea about where I would like the series to be going if it ends up being a success. There is much more in the world than I will be able to fit in this one light novel and if people like the result, I will definitely write more.<br/>I am after all trying to make writing these fantasies my profession.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal would be adapting the light novel into a full length visual novel with emotional soundtrack and beautiful art, but such dream is still far in the future.<br/>A future which this project will allow me to get that much closer to.<br/><br/><br/><h3><b>Other ways you can help</b></h3>
<p>Even if you are unable to contribute to this project, you can still help!</p><p>If you like the idea, talk to your friends who might be interested, discuss it in your anime (manga/visualnovel/lightnovel) groups and forums.

 world is reality, spreading love towards characters from games, anime 
and manga and spending lot of time with said characters in my daydreams 
and fantasies. This strong imagination is however often praised and I have
been told many times that people would love to read more of the stories
happening in my mind. And so I would like to fulfill my dream and make
writing my profession to share my fantasy worlds with others and to improve
creating and describing them.
*2d vs 3d: in manga slang
these terms are used to distinguish the anime/manga world (2d) and the real
world (3d). 
The
story 
These are the genres you can expect to be touched in the story:Romance, Post-Apocalyptic World, Mystery, Fantasy, Drama, Science Fiction, Alternative
Dimensions, DreamsPremise of the story:
Hundreds of years after a nuclear apocalypse, the few survivors living in
underground bunkers were able to continue the human legacy. Nobody was however
able to rebuild what was once destroyed - that being hope for peace,
technological progress and other great deeds that people before the war were
striving to achieve.
Yukirou used to live in one of these bunkers. But just like people fought
during the war, people these days still fight the same way. And even though the
ideals they are fighting for might have changed over the centuries, the main
reasons for fighting remain the same - greed, lust for power, desire to control
others.
And so during his childhood, after a riot caused a series of malfunctions
resulting in a full lockdown and large fire spreading throughout the bunker,
he was forced to escape using a secret shaft only a young and agile boy like
him could fit through, leaving behind everyone he knew and loved.
Thrown into the outside world full of dangerous animals and people (often times
very hard to distinguish the two apart), he soon met a mysterious girl. Introducing
herself as Chiiko, she started addressing Yukirou as onii-chan*,
despite this being the first time he met her. To Yukirou she almost seemed like a
gift from gods to guide him through the hell he must explore.
And so he ventured towards the future, towards all the mysteries of this land
that he is slowly discovering to be very different from what he was taught.
Perhaps the world is not what it seems to be. Hopefully Chiiko will have the
answers for him when the time to ask the questions comes.*onii-chan is a Japanese term younger sisters use to call their older
brothers, honorific -chan often signifies close relationship.
Format and style
Light novels are Japanese style of novel associated with the anime and manga culture, often receiving adaptations in those media. The characters in them are described (and often illustrated) in the 2d manga style with the romantic novels including cute girls with whom the readers often fall in love (this can be described using a Japanese term ""moe"").Visual novels (English term) are in Japan known mostly as ""eroge"" (erotic game) or just game (for non-erotic ones) and are a style of often interactive novels with visual representation of the characters on the screen. Most of the time focused on romance between the protagonist and the heroines in the story, they use very immersive first person style to make the reader feel like they are experiencing these stories themselves, together with the cute girls.As a result, the mixture of these 2 kinds of media I plan to put in use will be mainly focused on the immersion aspect. The story will be told in first person present tense to let the reader become the protagonist himself and experience the events the moment they happen, instead of being told a story after it has concluded like in regular novels. The main focus will therefore be on the dialogues between the characters, internal monologue of the protagonist, his thoughts and description of the world and events from his point of view. Action scenes and fighting scenes will be very rare, if there is any fight to be had, it will be a mental fight with an inner self, a fight to overcome the obstacles the world puts between Yukirou and his goal, a fight to not give up.There will be no erotic content in this book as I am not yet fully familiar with publishing of such works and I want to reach to as wide audience as possible, including younger students seeking romantic stories with lots of deep thoughts.The level of English I plan to use should be fairly easy to read for everyone who is used to reading visual novel or light novel translations. The vocabulary used will be mostly simple so even not native English readers can enjoy it.
The philosophical ideas behind the world are going to be the main focus of the writing.Instead of pondering about the meaning of a confusing word, you will be pondering about the meaning of a confusing world.Sample
To have a pretty good idea how my style of writing looks like, you can check the prologue and second part of chapter 1. It is still work in progress and some things might change for the final release.Prologue (3 pages) - View PDF in browser | Download PDF
Chapter 1 pt.2 (10 pages) - View PDF in browser | Download PDFWhat I need and where does it goI've been working on the story and main plot points of the book for about a year but in the past months I was not able to focus on it as I would like.So what I need is several months when I can just sit down and focus only on the writing full time, undisturbed by the 3d world.The funds will go towards the following:
Very basic living expenses
Fees related to the funding - that includes indiegogo fees and Paypal transfer fees
Fees related to the online publishing of the title
Future of the seriesThe story doesn't end here! I actually have a pretty good idea about where I would like the series to be going if it ends up being a success. There is much more in the world than I will be able to fit in this one light novel and if people like the result, I will definitely write more.I am after all trying to make writing these fantasies my profession.The ultimate goal would be adapting the light novel into a full length visual novel with emotional soundtrack and beautiful art, but such dream is still far in the future.A future which this project will allow me to get that much closer to.Other ways you can help
Even if you are unable to contribute to this project, you can still help!If you like the idea, talk to your friends who might be interested, discuss it in your anime (manga/visualnovel/lightnovel) groups and forums. Spreading the word can help more than you might think.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>As the US plans to end combat in Afghanistan in 2013-2014, the Central Asia/South Asia region is under great stress and facing severe challenges from authoritarian regimes causing human rights, social, and environmental problems. Yet little is known about these regions outside the specialists in governments, foundations, and establishment foreign policy circles. Russia, the US 
and China are all competing for influence and extraction of resources in this region. I 
want to promote an alternative public-funded approach to news on 
international and regional affairs via social media.and network with other like-minded journalists and civil society advocates.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Different Stans is a project to use social media (blog, Twitter, Facebook, etc.) and several curated news streams on Scoop.it to translate, digest, and discuss the news and views of the Central/South Asia region during 2012-2014, as the US plans to
 end combat and withdraw troops. This is a critical period for the 
people of Afghanistan and their neighbours who already experience an 
Afghan war spillover effect.Often Russia is covered in isolation from its neighbours; or only the post-Soviet ""stans"" are covered without reference to Pakistan and India. I think it's important to follow trends throughout all these areas without isolating them or narrowing the focus to specifically military issues.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The goal is not only a more informed public, but more participation from interested people in foreign policy, and formation of connections to people in the region to hear their stories and learn their issues. The US has a military delivery route called the Northern Distribution Network throughout the region which it envisions converting into a New Silk Road for prosperity. Is the US military presence unwelcome? Is the business only with state-own corporations mired in corruption? What is the impact on the environment of roads and pipelines? Who gets a say in decision-making about the scarce water and energy resources in the region?  People need to ask these questions because their tax dollars pay for it.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have been writing and translating stories from this region for 30 year. I would like to cover the region independently, and find several collegial fellow writers and photographers to cover this region with me.  I am committed to continuing to blog frequently on a volunteer basis while I make a living translating and consulting. But I am setting a fund-raising goal of $5000 for the next three months to be able to devote more time to this project and also pay some honoraria to reporters and photographers in the region. Suggestions of contacts and input are welcome.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>By publicizing this project, I'm hoping to find other writers who would like to help cover this region during this critical period, first on a volunteer basis and then hopefully to cover some costs. I would welcome comments and requests and critiques from people using a pseudonym if need be.<br/></p>

The quiet of the rural area is disrupted when local resident artist Rebecca Sloan reads an obituary in the local newspaper. A local store owner, Harry Meyerson, has lost another wife and Rebecca starts to question the deaths of his other wives.  Her investigations reveal that she is not the only one that is suspicious of Harry Meyerson and things really heat up when she gets the local district attorney involved.</p>

<p><strong>About Sandra Luce and Linda Sue</strong></p>
<p>Imagine, if you will, you have a favorite Aunt, she is an artist, a gardener, decorates her house beautifully, always dresses impeccably.  That was my Aunt Sandy. Then, you learn she is writing a book, you’re not surprised, she is extremely creative.  You know she finished it and you’re excited to read her creation but she falls ill and is unable to get her book published before she leaves us.  Life gets in the way, as it tends to do, years go by and her manuscript sits in a box (or in this case it was a basket).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That’s where I come in, I’m Linda Sue. I asked my cousin Lisa (Sandra’s daughter) about the book and she loaned me the basket with the manuscript to see if I could do something with it. So, I have her original typewritten manuscript (yes, it was before computers) and have been madly entering it into my computer so that it can be published. I am almost finished and need help to take it to the next step.   As for my creative side, I have been designing and creating handmade greeting cards for several years, have done wedding invitations, birthday party invites, etc which is why I choose to use them as part of the perk package for the fundraising effort.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That’s where you come in, I need your help in getting the book published. I am offering some perks in return for your support! Please review them and purchase the pre-order package that makes sense for you. If all the funding is received the book should be done just after the 1<sup>st</sup> of next year. A portion of book profits will be donated to a literacy program to support adult and child literacy and encourage reading.<strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>What I Need</strong></p>
<p>This book is coming together. There are a few more things like editing, cover design and printing that need to happen. I am reaching out to you to believe in this book and pre-order it! When you pre-order it today, you’ll get your copy before ANYONE else plus any other bonuses you pick up.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What else can you do?</strong></p>
<p>Help me spread the word, “like” the “Those Meyerson Women” page on Facebook, ask your friends and family to do the same and let them know about the fundraising efforts underway on Indiegogo.com.  If you have followers on Pinterest or Twitter let them know too. You are welcome to use the Indiegogo share tools! Thanks so much for your support!</p>
<p>IF GOAL IS NOT REACHED: If the funding falls short, It will take longer but I will struggle as best I can to try to complete the publication of the book on my own.  It means a lot to me and to Aunt Sandy’s family to complete the project.</p>
<p>IF FUNDING EXCEEDS GOAL- If funding exceeds initial goal, it will help fund additional printings and marketing and the search for a publisher.</p>
</div></div>","About ""Those Meyerson Women""
“Actually, it was the obituary that started all of this”.  From the first line you are pulled into this story as it comes to life around you. Set in the Chapman Town area of Chico, California. The quiet of the rural area is disrupted when local resident artist Rebecca Sloan reads an obituary in the local newspaper. A local store owner, Harry Meyerson, has lost another wife and Rebecca starts to question the deaths of his other wives.  Her investigations reveal that she is not the only one that is suspicious of Harry Meyerson and things really heat up when she gets the local district attorney involved.

<h3>Why We Exist</h3>
<p>This magazine is a brainchild from my graduate school class. I wanted to do a project that was informative and fun. It reaches to the depth of who I am and where I have come from.  Society put me in a place where I didn't know what to do with the limited amount of information I had access to. I filled in the gaps. </p>
<p>I met lots of other women who did the same. It would have been great if while I was encountering these problems someone gave me helpful information.  That is what this magazine is designed to do.  Different women will share their experiences of filling in their gaps across different issues like healthcare, parenting, relationships, finances, legal, and so on.</p>

<p><i><strong>Important Note: The initial $4k raised will go straight toward publishing and editing costs, so my real goal is to go over this! If I raise $6k, I will consider releasing an audio-book.</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>It's about impact-driven companies and how the space of impact, missions, and sustainability has been growing over the past 10 years and will continue to grow exponentially. The hope is that it will inform both people entering the workforce as well as existing industry leaders about the huge trend that will soon affect all businesses due to pressing issues that we can no longer avoid (i.e. the environmental crisis).<br/><br/><i>Exponential Benefit </i>(working title) explores how the impact-driven space has evolved over the past decade or so. It predicts how this trend will continue to evolve.<br/><br/>The book discusses the ways in which sustainability and being driven by a mission will become relevant for all businesses. It also offers recommendations for what concrete changes companies can make in order to have more meaningful impacts on the world.<br/><br/>My name is Mariana Rodriguez and I am the author of Exponential Benefit. I wrote this book because as I considered options of companies to work for after graduating college, I sought out places where I could have a positive impact on the world through my work. Yet, I struggled to find a place where I could do so to the extent I wanted. I continue to seek where I would be most fulfilled, and through this book, am hoping to help others find their own interests within the space.<br/><br/>In reading this book, my hope is that you will discover why the recent growth in impact-driven companies is so relevant for new and older generations. I want you to learn why in a not-so-distant future every single company will have to consider this issue at some level.<br/><br/>Through it, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement in you that I have for making a change through work. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you distinguish truly impactful companies from ones that don’t result in much action when considering where to work, where to purchase from, and who to support. You will find that in this book as well as ideas for how to change companies themselves into powerful agents for change.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the most successful business models for impact-driven companies as well as why it's becoming necessary for a business to be both sustainable and socially conscious.<br/><br/>You'll learn...</p>
<ul>
<li>How science proves that sustainability and a mission is good for business</li>
<li>How charity: water has become the most successful, and beautiful, non-profit organization</li>
<li>The most promising impact-spaces to work for, invest in, or buy from</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if</p>
<ul>
<li>You are a millennial trying to navigate finding meaningful and financially secure work</li>
<li>You are into impact-driven / environmental / socially-conscious trends and want to learn more about them</li>
<li>You are a business-owner considering how your business will have to change in the next decade to accommodate public demands</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>
<li>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December of 2019</li>
<li>The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!</li>
<li>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)</li>
<li>The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this winter.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>When I pre-sell 100 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish an audiobook. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition! My ultimate goal is to pre-sell between 200-400, so your support is very much appreciated. If you are particularly interested in this topic or work with companies that are impact-driven, purchasing multiple copies for fellow employees or interested friends is even more of a help. It makes for a great Christmas gift!<br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my paperback now:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will receive a personally signed (and early) copy of the book when I publish</li>
<li>A Personal, handwritten thank you note for pre-ordering my book</li>
<li>Your name will appear in a Special, Acknowledgements Section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”)</li>
<li>Early access to the Introduction of my Book and my entire manuscript, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback</li>
<li>The opportunity to help give me feedback and be involved in selecting my cover</li>
<li>I will do a book topic/workshop seminar where I will share the experiences of writing my book</li>
<li>And more...</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - Exponential Benefit</h3>
<p>The book is written in 6 Parts...</p>
<p><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + two and a half additional chapters. Here, you will be introduced to what impact means, why it has historically been seen as separate from profit, and why they should really go hand in hand. You will hear stories about why money is, in fact, necessary for impact, and why impact should be a part of every business and industry.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 3-7, which focus on the urgency of creating change, which issues are driving the most change, and how companies are leveraging that need with the need to be successful in business.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 8-13 and discusses the problems with how some companies are balancing the two needs. Specifically, are some companies faking it? How can we create an impact that actually matters? What can we do differently?<br/><br/>Part 4 contains Chapters 13.5-16 and discusses what people are already doing well in order to balance profit and purpose, as well as some of the most promising emerging fields in this space. There is a chapter dedicated to environmental issues and how they're being targeted, which for me is probably the #1 crisis we are facing as humans.<br/><br/>Part 5 contains Chapters 17-21 and introduces an organization that goes above and beyond with what they have been able to achieve and continue to achieve, in addition to going into depth about why and how it's able to do this.<br/><br/>You will learn how to recognize and seek out these organizations so that you will truly feel motivated by your work. You will also hopefully be convinced that every single business in the future will have to, in some shape or form, integrate sustainability into their business model.<br/><br/>Part 6 contains Chapters 21.5-24. It offers conclusions on the topic, reflections on what has been learned, and recommendations for going forward. This is a call to action and a call for consciousness about the issues that all of us are facing.</p>

<p><strong>Mariana Rodriguez</strong> currently works on Business Operations at Commonwealth Fusion Systems, a start-up company partnering with MIT researching and developing clean fusion energy for the world. She is also a recent Tufts University graduate of Psychology with a background in Management studies.<br/><br/>With graduation approaching, Mariana wanted to find a place she could work and be challenged professionally, but also somewhere she could make an impact on the world. Finding good information about this to be lacking, she embarked on her own search, interviewing dozens of people about the topic. This book is a collection of experiences, stories, and her own opinions about how the impact-driven trend has evolved and how it will continue to evolve.<br/><br/>Mariana’s first love (and still a current love) are books and writing. She also enjoys singing, painting, photography, and scuba diving with bull sharks (and all other animals, but her favorite are bull sharks). Her bucket list of places to visit is based on where the best diving sites are. She can permanently be seen with at least four bruises on both legs as she is one of the clumsiest people you will meet.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Mariana at mariana.rodriguezal@gmail.com and 917-972-3259.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.</p>

She can permanently be seen with at least four bruises on both legs as she is one of the clumsiest people you will meet.For more information you can connect with Mariana at mariana.rodriguezal@gmail.com and 917-972-3259.
 
Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.
 
Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family, and network. Please use #ExponentialBenefit and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page
Please share my book to 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it. Please do this as a text message or Direct Message on social media.

 
Thank you so much of all of your love and support!Thanks again,Mariana Rodriguez",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Howdy!</h3>
<p>My name's Ron, and I'm the author of Young Adult Paranormal Romance Silent Song. Its follow-up, Shattered Silence, is about ready to come out with the conclussion to the series and I'd like you to be part of this great project!</p>
<h3>But... is this really going to happen?</h3>
<p>Oh, yeah! The book is written. It has already undergone several revisions and I've booked a date with my Super Editor. The cover art is ready to go as well!</p>
<h3>So, why do you need the money?</h3>
<p>Well, several reasons... One of them is that this allows you to be part of the project from the get go, and it allows me to be in contact with you (which is something I love!). In doing so, we get to share some really cool perks--the icing on the cake!</p>
<p>Another big reason is, simply put, that getting a book out there is expensive. Getting it the attention it deserves and the PR to go with it is even more so.</p>
<h3>$500. Isn't that a convenient sum?</h3>
<p>Well... yes, I suppose it is! It probably looks weird because it's not the full cost of production, though. Instead of asking you to fund the whole thing, I decided to ask you to help me with the basic costs. At the moment, the project's expenses would look like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>350$ towards third-party, professional editing and proofreading.</li>
<li>150$ towards cover art and promo items.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we managed to raise more money, it'd go towards marketing and promotion. Which brings us to the real reason I chose that amount:</p>
<p>By asking for part of the costs, we can keep the sum small enough that there's hope of... stretch goals! With added perks. My favorite part!</p>
</div>
<h3>Less talk, more fact: what do we get?</h3>
<p>I've put together a list of perks for your contributions--the descriptions are in the sidebar, and in the project gallery you can find images of some products, like the bookmarks or the guitar picks.</p>
<p>However, imagine you want something not listed. Or a perk combination I didn't think of. Never worry! Let me know what you have in mind and we'll see if we can't work something out.</p>
<h3>Nice, but I can't invest in you right now...</h3>
<p>Ohhh, that hurts!</p>
<p>No, no, just kidding. I understand! But even if you can't claim a perk, you can still do something for this project: Tweet about it, tell your friends in Facebook, leave me a comment here to give me moral support...</p>
<p>Every little detail is appreciated!</p>
<h3>We have read this whole thing... some last words to add?</h3>
<p>Yep! If you've read all the info, that means you're serious about supporting me so you probably want to know that I'll be updating the project's media. With videos (even showing my face, yes) and such to let you know how we go.</p>

<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>My new book is called <strong>Mr. Bad Example</strong>.</p>
<p>""A drunken love story, full of sex, drugs, rock n roll, and other family values.""</p>
<p>Harlow Kingston is the wine loving social misfit who fell in love with the girl next door. He tried to be the man she wanted, but he fell for (and into bed with) many women along the way. He does his best to ignore his short comings by staying drunk, but it doesn't take long before his bad choices start catching up to him. He becomes a magnet for pointless sex, crazy people, and death.</p>
<p><br/>Harlow drinks his way into the hearts of three women he can't get enough of. One wants to help him be happy. One wants him all the time and doesn't care about anything else. The third wants him to grow up, stop drinking his life away, and do something with himself. Then there are the other ladies he has gotten carnal with.</p>
<p>He finds himself in a series of alcohol fueled bad situations before he's forced to make a choice. He has to stop his foolish, fleshy ways and settle on one of the amazing women in his life. A good woman won't wait around forever, but even if he makes the wrong decision, it changes everything. Someone has to get hurt.</p>
<p>Sometimes you love someone so much, all you can do is #@$% it up.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Crowd funding has been very successful for bands, indie filmmakers, and many other creative projects. There isn't any reason fans can't support a book related venture in the same way and collect some super swell perks too!</p>
<p><span>This fundraiser is not designed to cover printing cost. Those costs and other fees are covered by the publisher. This is just a campaign to get the books to the readers and meet the people who buy them. The publisher doesn't cover those costs.</span></p>
<p>The money raised will go towards a U.S. book tour. It will go into travel expenses and advertising.</p>

<p>All money raised will go into bringing this book to the readers. The way to do that is to take the book on tour. We need to hit every book store that welcomes indie authors. We will put all of the money we raise towards book signing/ reading events, travel cost, and aditional marketing.</p>

Praise for J. Travis Grundon
""J. Travis Grundon is a passionate, modern storyteller. His dystopian tales are the stuff of delightful nightmares.""  - Author Joe Schwartz, Games Men Play""J. Travis Grundon’s stories contain a dark realism that makes the characters seem like your neighbors as you watch the story unfold through your side window. He is a real talent to the literary world. "" - Director DP Bonnell, Happy Hooker Bang Bang 
 

""J. Travis Grundon's writing is quite strong as I had no trouble visiting these stories in my mind...I just didn't like being there much after I got there. That IS a compliment."" - Director John Taylor, LEACH""J. Travis Grundon is a visionary. You better watch out!"" - Nicholas Grabowsky, Red Wet Dirt/ Black Bed Sheet Books ""J. Travis Grundon 's stories are as familiar as sitting down to afternoon tea, but his ideas are as exotic and intoxicating as a good stiff shot added to the mix."" - Author B.C. Brown, A Touch of Darkness“J. Travis Grundon’s work has a unique voice in a world of similar voices, something that writers twice his age don’t have. His work, whether they’re straight-out horror, noir mashups or just plain weird, tells stories that strike nerves and stay in the memory long after you’re finished.” –Author John F.D.Taff, Little Deaths""J. Travis Grundon is an extremely diverse author, who draws you in with his definitive characters and the vivid stories they tell."" - Kitsie Duncan, Model/Actress ""J.

It's like fine literary nourishment, only incredibly uncomfortable and sadistically twisted."" - Director Jakob Bilinski, Shade of Grey“Gripping, intense, and unforgettable! J. Travis Grundon has an uncanny ability to suck you into a story. There is no “off limits” in his work. Any story written by him will be a true treat to any ones taste from the light reader to the truly demented hardcore fan!”  - Author Leslee Marie Schaffer, Fracas: A Collection of Short Friction

<p>The O'Neill National Critics Institute is designed for theater writers looking to strengthen their skills in an increasingly competitive job market.</p>
<p>At heart, NCI is an intensive writing workshop.  Critic-fellows turn out a piece of copy almost every night—a review of last night's show, a description of an individual actor's performance, an interview with the director.  After breakfast, the copy is read aloud and dissected by the group, under the direction of a seasoned theater writer or editor.  ""A boring script?""

<p>After lunch, the critic fellows are plunged into the O'Neill's production process.  Says Sullivan: ""For two weeks we live and breathe theater. We find out—if we didn't know already, and as a rookie reviewer, I didn't—how a director puts a new play on its feet in four days.  If Edward Albee visits the O'Neill, we sit down with Edward Albee.

<h3>HI EVERYONE</h3>
<p>I'm Rylan, and I am a creator of all kinds - I'm a fiction writer and musician, among other things.  This is my first online fundraising campaign, but there are others in the works and it certainly won't be my last.  Watching from the sidelines I've seen this community fund some very cool projects, and I figured this was a good place to appeal for support in completing a project I've been working on for about 8 years - a travel guide to the Bay Area.</p>
<p>I'm from the greater Bay and have been driving, taking trains and buses, skating and walking throughout the urban region ever since I've been able to.  During my time buying records I traveled to half of the record stores I could find in the area - and that's in a city of 7 million!  All this time I've been keeping notes and taking pictures, and writing a guide for visitors. </p>
<p>The goal of the guide is to get people that visit Northern California to go places other than Fisherman's Wharf (the most tacky part of SF), Monterey and Wine Country.  Personally I find these places to be a poor selection of what the Bay Area has to offer, and my hypothesis is that if the other parts of the Bay got more exposure tourists might start to scratch the surface of this large California metropolis.</p>
<p>From the sleepy fishing villages of the Sonoma coast to the vibrant and diverse culture of the East Bay, from majestic redwood groves of Santa Cruz County to the less traveled but incredible roads of urban San Francisco, I've been all over the Bay Area, and have accumulated enough material for a hell of a book.  This project has been in the works for a LONG time and has been a labor of love.</p>
<p>(An example chapter, about West San Francisco, is online at <a href=""http://driftbayarea.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"">driftbayarea.wordpress.com</a>)</p>
<p>But at this point, love is turning out not to be enough.  I'm broke, and don't have the budget I've had in the past to get out of town.  This is combined with the fact that the parts of the Bay I have less experience with are the farthest away from where I live.  I'm stuck on the project, and given my economic situation the only way for me to continue working on it right now is to ask for funding.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>WHAT I HAVE SO FAR</h3>
<p>I have 7 out of 10 sections of the guide done - three San Francisco sections, two East Bay sections, a Monterey Bay section and a section about the Peninsula and the South Bay.  The parts that aren't done are the sections on the North Bay, the Northeast Bay and the Tri-Valley region.  By area and population, about 80% of the Bay has been covered already.</p>
<p>I don't need much to finish the project, just some gas money, public transit money, and perhaps some money for lodging.  This is travel within the Bay Area, but the Bay is huge - given the return trip, driving from Santa Cruz to the North Bay can be the quivalent of driving 2/3s of the way from the Bay to Los Angeles.  It's not chump change anymore - I have thoroughly explored the areas closer to home base, and need to get to the outskirts on the opposite side of the city.</p>
<p>I don't need any publishing money; I'm going to publish digitally, on the kindle and in other formats, which lets me keep the guide cheap and also makes it more accessible and environmentally sound.  I'll be doing design and such myself.  Yes, I am technically asking for money to travel, but this isn't travel for fun as much as it is for finishing a project that is already mostly done.</p>
<h3>PERKS</h3>
<p>As far as perks, if you donate anything you will make the list of 'awesome people' in the back of the publication.  Beyond that, if you ever wanted to visit the Bay Area, I can help - a donation of $5 or more will get you a copy of the guide once it's completed, $20 or more will get you a consultation about your trip, and for $50 you get a personal driver for at least a day upon your visit, which is a pretty good deal really.</p>
<p>Like I said, anything helps me get closer to completing the guide.  If by some miracle I get more money than I need, I'm not going to throw a party - I plan on writing a guide to the Los Angeles area after this one is completed, and any excess funding will go into that project.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>THE GUIDE ITSELF</h3>
</div>
<div>If you feel like you might want to come to the Bay Area at some point, and if you're interested in purchasing a $5 digital guide that would give you a variety of good ideas for that trip, you could buy one now by funding this project.  I hope that this guide provides a sort of 'second opinion' in the travel literature world, because my tastes are not everyone's and seeing my take on things should help anyone in planning a unique trip to the Bay.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My research is broad and thorough - many places that are derided as having 'nothing to do there' actually have things to offer, and I seek to find those things as well as delve deep into places that have a 'lot' to do to see what actually IS worth doing there.  So if you'd like to see a guide like that published, you can make it happen here.</div>
<h3>OTHER STUFF</h3>
<div>If you can't donate yourself, but are in solidarity with the goal, you can still be awesome and could always tell other people about this campaign. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In addition, if you live in the Bay and have any travel tips, shoot me a message or something, I'm always down to hear new info.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well if you've read this far, you're definitely awesome and thanks for your time.  Like I said this is my first campaign, but I'll be on indiegogo again, so keep your eyes peeled.  Peace and see you later,</div>

<p>The road in the photograph is Highway 61 running out of Lake City, Minnesota, circa 1942.  This is the road my family took when we were run out of town in a vigilante action.  My father was a doctor who had grown up in Lake City.  He was the kind of man about whom people say, “I always knew he would grow up and kill someone.”  My father was born violent, his temper was uncontrollable.  He was raised in what was called “German-America,” a part of the Midwest in which many people had pro-German sympathies during World War I and the rise of the Third Reich.  That right-wing political culture and my father’s pathological anger combined to produce a doctor who was considered so dangerous, his hometown forced him, and his family, to leave.</p>
<p>My book tells two stories, a personal story of growing up with a violently extremist father and the political story of the reactionary environment that shaped him.  In the personal story, I write about the trauma my father inflicted on his family as his illness became more severe and his rage against people in the town increased.  The political story describes the way my hometown organized its vigilante action to drive my father out.  It also discusses the history of vigilantism in America and the immense power America’s German immigrants had on right-wing ideology in the United States. German-Americans were aggressive about promoting their radical right agenda in the Midwest and their politics led to violent vigilante actions against them during World War I. </p>
<p>I am, to my knowledge, the only person who has grown up with the extreme right wing who is writing about it and against it.  The combination of my graduate school education in political science and my frightening personal experience affords me a unique view of the radical right.  It has also given me motivation.  I want to share what I know.  The more we know about extremists, the more power we have to stop them.</p>

<p>Many thanks to those who donated on Indiegogo.com  as I attempted to raise funds to publish a ministry version of my book.  The campaign on Indiegogo is over. To give up on my campaign would mean giving up on what I believe is God's plan.  </p>
<p>Though I did not reach my goal on Indiegogo,  I will continue to pursue different ways of fundraising for this important ministry. As stated bellow, <i><b>If I don’t reach my goal,  I will try to get it published the least expensive way.  </b></i><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The funding I received on Indiegogo will be put towards that goal.</b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">  Thanks again.  God bless.</span></p>
<br/>
</div>
<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>My name is Kathy Graff and I am a member of FBC in CT.  I have been a Christian for over 20 years.  My ministries include praise band and drama among others.  I have recently published my first book based on my journey with cancer.</p>
<p>I am looking to publish a 2<sup>nd</sup> edition of my book.  The 1<sup>st</sup> edition has photographs that have raised the retail price of the book.  I would like to make my story more affordable by publishing the 2<sup>nd</sup> edition w/o photos.  This would drop the retail price from $24.99, to about $8.99.  </p>
<p>The reason I would like to do this is because of the positive feedback from those who have read my book. People who have cancer, those who don’t, people I know, and those I don’t know have conveyed their gratitude to me for sharing my story of hope. It has helped them through their cancer (and in some cases, not cancer but some other circumstance) and helped them draw closer to and trust God.  It addresses the physical, emotional and spiritual issues surrounding cancer and my personal spiritual walk with Jesus and how he brought me through the cancer against all medical odds. </p>
<p><b><i>Through your financial support, your investment will go much farther than just monetary.  You would also have a part in providing hope and encouragement for cancer patients by making my book more affordable in the long run.  Together we can minister to cancer patients.</i></b></p>
<p> <strong style=""line-height: 1.45em; font-size: 1.5em;"">What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I have set a goal of $4,100.  Here is the breakdown</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">$2099 is the price for publishing</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">$90 for google/amazon lookup (sneak peak)</span></li>
<li>$479 for a press release</li>
<li>$280 for IGG fee</li>
<li>$1124 for books at author discount of 50%.  These books would help me kick off my book campaign at speaking engagements AND be used for gifts/postage sent to you for your support.</li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>My Story</strong></h2>
<p>So you can get an idea of what is in my book, here is a synopsis.</p>
<p>In August of 2011, I was diagnosed with Stage 3-muscle invasive bladder cancer.  I went to 3 different doctors, 3 different hospitals and they were all in agreement that the bladder needed to come out, that it was squamous cell carcinoma, a very rare and aggressive cancer that most physicians believe there is no cure for, and that my weight would be a danger in surgery.  I felt like I had a literal death sentence.</p>
<p>Being crushed by all of this, I found my faith was being severely tested.  But I chose not to give up on God.  My family, friends and church prayed hard and fast, asking God to give me direction, and He did.  Before I knew it He sent me to the right hospital and surgeon who did the job.  That was October 14, 2011.  As of August 2013, I am 2 months away from the 2 year anniversary of my surgery and I am 100% cancer free without the benefit of treatment aside from the surgery – despite the fact that the cancer started to spread outside my bladder.  <b><i>When the odds were against me, God was for me.  </i></b>That was God’s hand of grace and providence over my life.  For every dark moment cancer brought into my life, Christ was there to counteract it with His Presence, grace and unfailing love in the most amazing ways.  This is HIS story and testimony He has given me, worthy to be penned. </p>
<p>Now I have a new lease on life and a purpose from God, which is to give hope and encouragement to those living with cancer through my book.  It is my passion, my purpose, my life.  If I could afford it, I would purchase the books myself and give them away to every cancer patient on the planet.  But, I can’t.  Getting the 2<sup>nd</sup> edition published for a lower retail price is as close as I can get to help just a few. </p>
<h2><strong>Other ways you can help if you can’t invest monetarily</strong></h2>
<p>I understand times are tough these days.  If you can’t invest funds for my campaign, I would ask that you get the word out about my project.  Use social media and word of mouth.  That would be a great help.  </p>
<p>Another thing is, reach out to a cancer patient from where you are.  Volunteer at a cancer center.  When I lead a cancer fellowship group a while back I found that most people didn’t like to talk about it.  I don’t know why.  But they (we) all need to know that someone cares, even a stranger. </p>
<p>Thank you again for your consideration in supporting my project.  May God help to find a cure for cancer in our lifetime.  God bless you!!!!</p>

Many thanks to those who donated on Indiegogo.com  as I attempted to raise funds to publish a ministry version of my book.  The campaign on Indiegogo is over. To give up on my campaign would mean giving up on what I believe is God's plan.  
Though I did not reach my goal on Indiegogo,  I will continue to pursue different ways of fundraising for this important ministry. As stated bellow, If I don’t reach my goal,  I will try to get it published the least expensive way.  The funding I received on Indiegogo will be put towards that goal.  Thanks again.  God bless.


Short Summary
My name is Kathy Graff and I am a member of FBC in CT.  I have been a Christian for over 20 years.  My ministries include praise band and drama among others.  I have recently published my first book based on my journey with cancer.
I am looking to publish a 2nd edition of my book.  The 1st edition has photographs that have raised the retail price of the book.  I would like to make my story more affordable by publishing the 2nd edition w/o photos.  This would drop the retail price from $24.99, to about $8.99.  
The reason I would like to do this is because of the positive feedback from those who have read my book. People who have cancer, those who don’t, people I know, and those I don’t know have conveyed their gratitude to me for sharing my story of hope. It has helped them through their cancer (and in some cases, not cancer but some other circumstance) and helped them draw closer to and trust God.  It addresses the physical, emotional and spiritual issues surrounding cancer and my personal spiritual walk with Jesus and how he brought me through the cancer against all medical odds. 
Through your financial support, your investment will go much farther than just monetary.  You would also have a part in providing hope and encouragement for cancer patients by making my book more affordable in the long run.  Together we can minister to cancer patients.
 What I Need & What You Get
I have set a goal of $4,100.  Here is the breakdown


$2099 is the price for publishing
$90 for google/amazon lookup (sneak peak)
$479 for a press release
$280 for IGG fee
$1124 for books at author discount of 50%.  These books would help me kick off my book campaign at speaking engagements AND be used for gifts/postage sent to you for your support.


A GIFT FOR YOU – For every person who donates $20 or more to my project, I would love to send you a free, signed copy of the 2nd edition of my book as a HUGE THANK YOU for your investment.
If I don’t reach my goal,  I will try to get it published the least expensive way, not order the books or the add on items.  But this would significantly lower the book's exposure to the public.

<p><strong>I'm a husband, father of 5 remarkable boys, former Government Officer, world traveler, Humanitarian and Church leader.   I've previously written a spiritual adventure guide, but ""Dulu"" is a story that has been in the works for over a decade.  It is intended to take kids aged 6 to 11 on a unique journey of discovery. <br/></strong></p>
<p>Dulu is an allegory for supernatural living. With illustrations (by Jacob Daniels), readers follow six friends into an adventure of crossing over into a forbidden land where they climb the magnificent mountain and meet the Father of all life before being sent back on a mission to change their own world of Dulu.  </p>
<p>This is the first of two books in this series. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Receive</h3>
<p>The goal is to raise $6,350 to go directly toward paying for illustrations, editing, and publishing. </p>
<p>Donors who give $100 or more will receive a signed copy of the first edition.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In a world of magic and wizardry, Dulu is a spiritual adventure filled with imagery, themes, and encounters with supernatural creatures described in the scriptures.</p>
<p>This project is an inspiring and spiritual on-ramp for your kids, nephews, nieces, grandkids and friends' kids to read and imagine living a real adventure here on the earth, similar in many ways to the kids in the story.</p>
<p>I've published a previous work (The Extraordinary Journey - A Spiritual Adventure Guide).  This is my first work written specifically for children.  As the father of 5 young boys, I've told hundreds of nighttime stories. This one is intended to help inspire kids to live large and see themselves as God sees them.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If unable to give financially, please help spread the word to parents of young kids or grandparents that you know. </p>
You can get the word out by tweeting, sharing on Facebook or emailing this link to them. There are tools that Indiegogo provides to help you get the word out to make Dulu a reality.</div>

<h3>Our Story  My name is Craig Graham. My Wife, Cheri Graham, was stricken with COPD a few years ago and her career and life as`she knew it ended and` she was forced to accept disability and all thought of a comfortable, well planned retirement vanished.  I, in turn, suffered a debilitating injury two years ago and my own career ended prematurely as well. We found our selves going into our supposed 'Golden Years' financially struggling. We reside in Amherst, NH. Fortunately, my wife has a gift. She loves children and animals.  And I've been  told I can write, and write well.  Cheri always wanted to write children's books. She posesses wonderful ideas.  That said, our first children's story, ""Chippy The Chipmunk"" was born. It's a story of small animals we all see every day who live their lives as we humans do with all the challenges and rewards people find, with all the goodness yet even life's dissappoinments . . . though written for children and for parents to read to their children. The stories are about values, common courtesies, mutual respect and all the ideals that make the world go round.  These basic, short, easy to read stories have been written. Finding a publisher is next to impossible. Waiting lists,  competition and lack of money have been our obstacles. We've had the stories critiqued and all who read them love them, especially children.  Our plan is to find a publisher that can publish these short stories for no more than $3000 or so,  including an artist, which is more than reasonable plus retain an experienced and reliable marketing company to get this project off the ground, in all, approximately $10,000. We have three publishers in mind and have researched this project to great detail.  With both our incomes limited, this may be a dream we may never accomplish unless we can raise this funding here.  With funding, our dream can come true within a year. Given Cheri's disability, time is of the essence.  Any help provided will be greatly appreciated.</h3>
<p>(Introduce yourself and tell your campaign's story. Make sure to cover the who, what, where, when and how of your campaign.)</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact  We like to have our stories published and marketed within a year as we are both getting on in years plus our stories are very relevant to what is going on in today's society. Family values, morals, manners, and our everyday ethics are constantly being bombarded and eroded at every turn. The positive impact our stories could create could be incalculable. Good , old-fashioned family values in stories written by folks who have seen our values assaulted,  compromised and so long forgotten has to still have a place in our society. Our project is for the children.  Life is not always about money.</h3>
<p>(What is the impact your campaign may have on others? What if your campaign doesn't happen, what are the consequences? Make it real for people.)</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get  We have three basic stories written and in manuscript form. We also have three publishers interested and`are being told that actual publishing begins with a minimum of $2000 up front. We have an artist who can provide illustrations, high quality illustrations for approximately $3000 and the artistry is truly professional, by hand, and of a very unique style reminiscient of the fairy tales of old. Each character is beautifully personified and colorful.  Marketing is the next level and that can run anywhere from $3000 to $5000 just to get the books on the shelves in limited editions. We will be dealing with a local publisher here in the New Hampshire area and our illustrator, Bruce Woods, has many years experience and a portfolio of work that is truly magnificent.  Marketing companies are being suggested by the publishers but we'd rather inject some due diligence, find a marketing firm with a solid track record in childrens' literature and negotiate a situation that will be most effective. There could be incidental expenses and such but our plan is to hire a literary agent to oversee the project to insure the money is being well spent and the project is brought in within a timely fashion.  The stories we have written . . . and the ones about to be written are all manuscript ready and we only require funding to put this altogether.  Help us fulfill a dream.

</div></div>","Our Story  My name is Craig Graham. My Wife, Cheri Graham, was stricken with COPD a few years ago and her career and life as`she knew it ended and` she was forced to accept disability and all thought of a comfortable, well planned retirement vanished.  I, in turn, suffered a debilitating injury two years ago and my own career ended prematurely as well. We found our selves going into our supposed 'Golden Years' financially struggling. We reside in Amherst, NH. Fortunately, my wife has a gift. She loves children and animals.  And I've been  told I can write, and write well.  Cheri always wanted to write children's books. She posesses wonderful ideas.  That said, our first children's story, ""Chippy The Chipmunk"" was born. It's a story of small animals we all see every day who live their lives as we humans do with all the challenges and rewards people find, with all the goodness yet even life's dissappoinments . . . though written for children and for parents to read to their children. The stories are about values, common courtesies, mutual respect and all the ideals that make the world go round.  These basic, short, easy to read stories have been written. Finding a publisher is next to impossible. Waiting lists,  competition and lack of money have been our obstacles. We've had the stories critiqued and all who read them love them, especially children.  Our plan is to find a publisher that can publish these short stories for no more than $3000 or so,  including an artist, which is more than reasonable plus retain an experienced and reliable marketing company to get this project off the ground, in all, approximately $10,000. We have three publishers in mind and have researched this project to great detail.  With both our incomes limited, this may be a dream we may never accomplish unless we can raise this funding here.  With funding, our dream can come true within a year. Given Cheri's disability, time is of the essence.  Any help provided will be greatly appreciated.
(Introduce yourself and tell your campaign's story. Make sure to cover the who, what, where, when and how of your campaign.)



The Impact  We like to have our stories published and marketed within a year as we are both getting on in years plus our stories are very relevant to what is going on in today's society. Family values, morals, manners, and our everyday ethics are constantly being bombarded and eroded at every turn. The positive impact our stories could create could be incalculable. Good , old-fashioned family values in stories written by folks who have seen our values assaulted,  compromised and so long forgotten has to still have a place in our society. Our project is for the children.  Life is not always about money.
(What is the impact your campaign may have on others? What if your campaign doesn't happen, what are the consequences? Make it real for people.)



What We Need & What You Get  We have three basic stories written and in manuscript form. We also have three publishers interested and`are being told that actual publishing begins with a minimum of $2000 up front. We have an artist who can provide illustrations, high quality illustrations for approximately $3000 and the artistry is truly professional, by hand, and of a very unique style reminiscient of the fairy tales of old. Each character is beautifully personified and colorful.  Marketing is the next level and that can run anywhere from $3000 to $5000 just to get the books on the shelves in limited editions. We will be dealing with a local publisher here in the New Hampshire area and our illustrator, Bruce Woods, has many years experience and a portfolio of work that is truly magnificent.  Marketing companies are being suggested by the publishers but we'd rather inject some due diligence, find a marketing firm with a solid track record in childrens' literature and negotiate a situation that will be most effective. There could be incidental expenses and such but our plan is to hire a literary agent to oversee the project to insure the money is being well spent and the project is brought in within a timely fashion.  The stories we have written . . . and the ones about to be written are all manuscript ready and we only require funding to put this altogether.  Help us fulfill a dream. We will provide dedications and book signings for donations over $50/

<p>In the 3 years since its inception, Battle Born Slam has gone from a coffeeshop full of quiet poet types to a raucous crowd that rock downtown Las Vegas once a month with a unique blend of traditional poetry aesthetic drizzled with modern, hip sensibility. We've brought workshop programs to local youth in community events and through featured appearaces at high schools, presented work at major festivals including First Friday and the 18b Music Festival, and have helped progress spoken word in Las Vegas to a level its never seen before.</p>
<p>But for us to take the next step, we need your help! We were able to compete at last year's National Poetry Slam in Charlotte, NC and brought home the first ever win in a bout for a Las Vegas team, and this year we hope to build on that success as we travel to Cambridge, MA to compete again!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>HOW MUCH WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</h2>
<p>We hope to raise $3,000 through this campaign which will go directly to travel expenses and lodging for our week-long stay at NPS 2013 in Cambridge. Any funds in excess of our goal will go directly into the slam fund, which is dedicated exclusively to expenses that allow us to bring more workshops, slams, and constructive community projects in the Las Vegas area.</p>

With this dedication in mind, Kitsch has published fiction, high-caliber art and photography, interviews with local and global figures, reviews of literature, film, and music, cultural criticism, back-handed observations, personal essays, lengthy tirades, loving odes, and much more. We extensively edit all articles in a way that allows writers to have hands-on journalistic experience and ensures that pieces are of the highest quality.

WE CANNOT WAIT TO SHARE THIS ISSUE WITH YOU ALL. WE ARE SO CLOSE!!!Kitsch magazine was founded 12 years ago to fill what students felt was an obvious void on campus— there needed to be a publication that focused on longer, investigative, creative, and altogether unhindered pieces on subject matter that effected communities both in and outside of Cornell. With this dedication in mind, Kitsch has published fiction, high-caliber art and photography, interviews with local and global figures, reviews of literature, film, and music, cultural criticism, back-handed observations, personal essays, lengthy tirades, loving odes, and much more. We extensively edit all articles in a way that allows writers to have hands-on journalistic experience and ensures that pieces are of the highest quality.

Ja sam Iva Plavšić. Pilula sreće je r</strong><strong>oman o prijateljstvu, ljubavi, hrabrosti i nadi, ali i o gluposti, ponosu, strahu i predrasudama.</strong> <br/></p><p> </p><p align=""center""><b>RADNJA ROMANA</b></p><p align=""center""><strong></strong> </p><p><em>Naša glavna junakinja Lea raste u  devedesetima u ozračju, gdje sve više mladih ljudi završava u parku s bocom u ruci. Konzervativno društvo, umjesto da im pomogne, stavlja ih na stup srama i ukazuje prstom na njih, a iza kulisa izviruje jasna činjenica da je društvo itekako svjesno svoje odgovornosti, makar je odbija priznati. Nisu samo roditelji zakazali već čitavo društvo prestaje paziti na mlade i na djecu koja se trenutno nalaze u najranjivijim godinama. </em></p><p><em>Lea i njezini prijatelji, koji usred bezbrižnog odrastanja odjednom bivaju pogođeni najsurovijom stvarnošću, pokušavaju se nositi sa svakodnevnicom na način da se priklanjaju alternativi-drugačijem načinu razmišljanja od onog kojeg čovjeku nameće<br/>neoliberalizam. Suočavamo se i s ozračjem Leine srednje škole koja se u ratnim<br/>vremenima nalazi u rasulu. Mnogima se ne sviđa činjenica da su upisali umjetničku školu, a po novom će programu morati završiti gimnaziju i učenici radi toga krenu u mirne demonstracije kojima apsolutno ništa ne postižu. U jednom od slijedećih poglavlja Leine školske kolege Bocu i Muca nakon akcije kojom njih dvojica pružaju konkretan otpor novom školskom režimu, vlasti u školi identificiraju i oštro kažnjavaju. Boci se uskoro gubi svaki trag i policija ga proglašava nestalim. </em></p><p><em>Zajedno s </em><em>nekolicinom svojih najbližih prijatelja Lea se, poput kakve<br/>ulične </em><em>heroine, pokušava oduprijeti onima koji žele na silu promijeniti lice starog grada. </em></p><p>U romanu upoznajemo i Sanjina. On i Lea nađu se nekoliko puta na istim mjestima, međutim kako u njihovoj zemlji bjesni rat i oko njih je konstantno kaotična situacija, te dvije srodne duše stalno se mimoilaze. U trenutku kada se Lea i Sanjin napokon upoznaju, ona mu povjerava kako je protiv nje napravljena zavjera i da joj je život u opasnosti. Sanjin počinje shvaćati da se upleo u nešto mnogo opasnije i kompliciranije nego što je uopće mogao zamisliti ...<br/> </p><p align=""center""><b>MALO O MENI </b></p><p align=""center""><strong></strong> </p><p>2001. godine objavljen mi je prvi roman <strong>„Eva-izgubljena generacija“</strong>, a već druge godine objavljuju moj drugi roman <strong>""Oporuka iz budućnosti"".</strong> Moje pjesme <strong>„1991“</strong> i <strong>„Bijeli konj</strong>“ izlaze 1997. godine u novinama.  </p><p>Pročitajte više o mojem radu na <strong>web stranici</strong>: <b><a href=""http://www.pilulasrece.com/%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.pilulasrece.com</a> </b> gdje možete besplatno pročitati prvih šest poglavlja novog romana ""Pilula sreće.""

My name is Iva Plavšić. “The Pill of Happiness” is a novel about friendship, love, courage and hope, but also about ignorance, pride, fear and prejudices. </strong></p><p><strong></strong> </p><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">NOVEL ACTION</h4><p> </p><p><em>The novel begins in the 80’ of the last century in the capital of Socialistic Republic Croatia (one of the six Yugoslav republics). Marshal Tito is dead. Some people predict military dictatorship, the others are afraid of the civil war and breakup of Yugoslavia. The action flows chronologically. The little girl called Lea is growing up in a very intense atmosphere. All adults are frightened. More and more young<br/>people end in a park with a bottle in their hands.</em><span><em>  The conservative society is putting them </em><em><b>to </b>shame. They are pointing their finger instead of helping them, and behind<br/>the scene it is perfectly obvious that the society is aware of its responsibility but  declines to admit it. The whole society, not only the parents, stops taking care for the teenagers who are presently in the most sensitive years of their growing-up. </em></span></p><p><em>Lea and her friends, in the middle of their care-free youth, suddenly start to experience a most horrible reality. Amid the war they are trying to survive listening to gothic, punk rock and rock music. </em><em>As the readers we confront with the environment<br/>of her high school in a capital of Croatia (Zagreb), which is in disorder during the war.</em><span><em>  A great number of pupils cannot adapt so suddenly to a new order: after the break of socialism Croatian authorities simply closed up their famous Art School.  The pupils do not like the fact that they have registered to a good art school and now, almost over the night, they are the pupils of the ordinary high school. Soon the pupils began to stand up for their rights in demonstrations but they have not achieved anything. After Boca’s and Muc’s<br/>(Lea’s friends) night action in the school’s building, school’s authorities identify two fellows and punish them. Boca just vanishes one day and police proclaims his disappearance. </em></span><em> </em></p><p><em>Lea did not surrender, she is fighting not only for her place under the sun, but for the others, for majority!</em><span><em>  Together with her best and closest friends, Lea is trying to contravene aggressive individuals who are planning to change the heart of her city.  She is honest, equitable, virginal and spotless, she has got a power and she is capable to turn Zagreb upside down ... </em></span><em> </em></p><p><em>In this novel we meet Sanjin. He and Lea appear several times in the same places, however their land is in war and around them is constantly a chaotic situation, so they miss each other. When they finally meet, two rebels instantly fall in love and the real tangle has just begun. She confides him that conspiracy has been made against her and that her life is in danger. Sanjin begins to comprehend he met with something more dangerous and complicated than he could imagine.</em></p><h4 style=""text-align: center;"">

</span></div>","(PLEASE SCROLL DOWN FOR ENGLISH TRANSLATION)                DOBRODOŠLI NA INDIEGOGO KAMPANJU ROMANA PILULA SREĆE!   Pridružite se i Vi kako bi ovaj roman mogao ugledati svjetlo dana! Bok! Ja sam Iva Plavšić. Pilula sreće je roman o prijateljstvu, ljubavi, hrabrosti i nadi, ali i o gluposti, ponosu, strahu i predrasudama.  RADNJA ROMANA Naša glavna junakinja Lea raste u  devedesetima u ozračju, gdje sve više mladih ljudi završava u parku s bocom u ruci. Konzervativno društvo, umjesto da im pomogne, stavlja ih na stup srama i ukazuje prstom na njih, a iza kulisa izviruje jasna činjenica da je društvo itekako svjesno svoje odgovornosti, makar je odbija priznati. Nisu samo roditelji zakazali već čitavo društvo prestaje paziti na mlade i na djecu koja se trenutno nalaze u najranjivijim godinama. Lea i njezini prijatelji, koji usred bezbrižnog odrastanja odjednom bivaju pogođeni najsurovijom stvarnošću, pokušavaju se nositi sa svakodnevnicom na način da se priklanjaju alternativi-drugačijem načinu razmišljanja od onog kojeg čovjeku namećeneoliberalizam. Suočavamo se i s ozračjem Leine srednje škole koja se u ratnimvremenima nalazi u rasulu. Mnogima se ne sviđa činjenica da su upisali umjetničku školu, a po novom će programu morati završiti gimnaziju i učenici radi toga krenu u mirne demonstracije kojima apsolutno ništa ne postižu. U jednom od slijedećih poglavlja Leine školske kolege Bocu i Muca nakon akcije kojom njih dvojica pružaju konkretan otpor novom školskom režimu, vlasti u školi identificiraju i oštro kažnjavaju. Boci se uskoro gubi svaki trag i policija ga proglašava nestalim. Zajedno s nekolicinom svojih najbližih prijatelja Lea se, poput kakveulične heroine, pokušava oduprijeti onima koji žele na silu promijeniti lice starog grada. U romanu upoznajemo i Sanjina. On i Lea nađu se nekoliko puta na istim mjestima, međutim kako u njihovoj zemlji bjesni rat i oko njih je konstantno kaotična situacija, te dvije srodne duše stalno se mimoilaze. U trenutku kada se Lea i Sanjin napokon upoznaju, ona mu povjerava kako je protiv nje napravljena zavjera i da joj je život u opasnosti. Sanjin počinje shvaćati da se upleo u nešto mnogo opasnije i kompliciranije nego što je uopće mogao zamisliti ... MALO O MENI  2001. godine objavljen mi je prvi roman „Eva-izgubljena generacija“, a već druge godine objavljuju moj drugi roman ""Oporuka iz budućnosti"". Moje pjesme „1991“ i „Bijeli konj“ izlaze 1997. godine u novinama.  Pročitajte više o mojem radu na web stranici: www.pilulasrece.com  gdje možete besplatno pročitati prvih šest poglavlja novog romana ""Pilula sreće.""

My name is Iva Plavšić. “The Pill of Happiness” is a novel about friendship, love, courage and hope, but also about ignorance, pride, fear and prejudices.  NOVEL ACTION The novel begins in the 80’ of the last century in the capital of Socialistic Republic Croatia (one of the six Yugoslav republics). Marshal Tito is dead. Some people predict military dictatorship, the others are afraid of the civil war and breakup of Yugoslavia. The action flows chronologically. The little girl called Lea is growing up in a very intense atmosphere. All adults are frightened. More and more youngpeople end in a park with a bottle in their hands.  The conservative society is putting them to shame. They are pointing their finger instead of helping them, and behindthe scene it is perfectly obvious that the society is aware of its responsibility but  declines to admit it. The whole society, not only the parents, stops taking care for the teenagers who are presently in the most sensitive years of their growing-up. Lea and her friends, in the middle of their care-free youth, suddenly start to experience a most horrible reality. Amid the war they are trying to survive listening to gothic, punk rock and rock music. As the readers we confront with the environmentof her high school in a capital of Croatia (Zagreb), which is in disorder during the war.  A great number of pupils cannot adapt so suddenly to a new order: after the break of socialism Croatian authorities simply closed up their famous Art School.  The pupils do not like the fact that they have registered to a good art school and now, almost over the night, they are the pupils of the ordinary high school. Soon the pupils began to stand up for their rights in demonstrations but they have not achieved anything. After Boca’s and Muc’s(Lea’s friends) night action in the school’s building, school’s authorities identify two fellows and punish them. Boca just vanishes one day and police proclaims his disappearance.  Lea did not surrender, she is fighting not only for her place under the sun, but for the others, for majority!  Together with her best and closest friends, Lea is trying to contravene aggressive individuals who are planning to change the heart of her city.  She is honest, equitable, virginal and spotless, she has got a power and she is capable to turn Zagreb upside down ...  In this novel we meet Sanjin. He and Lea appear several times in the same places, however their land is in war and around them is constantly a chaotic situation, so they miss each other. When they finally meet, two rebels instantly fall in love and the real tangle has just begun. She confides him that conspiracy has been made against her and that her life is in danger. Sanjin begins to comprehend he met with something more dangerous and complicated than he could imagine.
 A FEW WORDS ABOUT ME I published the first novel called “Eva-the Lost Generation” in 2001. Next year I published a second novel called ""A Testament from the Future”. In 1997’ I published two poems: „1991“ and „A White Horse“ in the newspapers.  You can take a look at my art photos on web page: www.pilulasrece.com (I was working for 20 years as a photo model) but you can not read the first six chapters of my new book (it is free of cost) because it is in Croatian.  If I manage somehow to raise more money than I expected, my publisher will translate this book to English.Take a close look at the gallery where I have put another four video's and some interesting photos.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Olexandr Shevchenko, I am instructor in History at the University of Manitoba and freelance translator and interpreter. I teach course “Ukrainians in Canada” and I was really thrilled when I read the book by Myrna Kostash “All of Baba’s Children”. The book is really fantastic, it captures the incredible story of Ukrainian immigrants to Canada and tells their story in their own voice. I am absolutely sure this book must be translated into Ukrainian language and made available for the readers in Ukraine. For this I need your help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need funding to help me with the expenses for translating and publishing this book. Once translation is complete I will have the book professionally edited and published. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<span>The biggest impact of this project is in allowing Ukrainian readers to enjoy truly remarkable piece of Ukrainian Canadiana. Moreover, it will allow to foster better understanding between two branches of Ukrainian tree on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.

who are on the path to success and those who are not: Knowing that they can
create any life they want. Attitude is everything and everything starts with
small steps!                          We want
to help young people recognize their talent. We want them to be a
part of something bigger. We want to show them how to make their
talent their story.
We want young people to
get Hooked on Happiness 
At the heart of this book is a basic truth… Everybody has a talent
This book will show teenagers and young people how to:
1)  Discover their talent
2)  Live on purpose
3)  Make a difference in their own lives and in the lives of others
by getting Hooked
on Happiness                                             Back to top DEUTSCH   I  ENGLISH

Das Glück am HakenIn meiner täglichen Arbeit mit Schülern und Studenten treffe ich jedes Jahr zahlreiche junge Menschen, die keine Ziele haben oder völlig unvorbereitet ins Leben starten und durch das Leben gehen.
Wir müssen zusammen arbeiten um junge Menschen zu animieren, sich nicht nur eine Überlebensstrategie zu schaffen, sondern eine Strategie, damit sie auch ausserhalb des Klassenzimmers erfolgreich sein können. Wir wollen ihnen helfen, ihre Begabungen zu erkennen und zu wissen, wie man sie richtig umsetzt.  
Es gibt eine Reihe von Erfolgsprinzipien die man braucht, um sein Leben richtig zu meistern. Fähigkeiten wie das Setzen von Zielen, Zeitmanagement und die Fähigkeit, sich immer aufs Neue zu motivieren. Aber leider lernt man das nicht in der Schule.                                
Es ist unsere Aufgabe, junge Menschen auf das Leben vorzubereiten, damit sie im Leben alles erreichen können. Es liegt in unserer Verantwortung ihnen beizubringen, wie sie ihre Talente entfalten und teil einer unglaublichen Reise sein können.                               Die heutige Jugend steht vor unzähligen Herausforderungen. Wir glauben, dass unsere Jugend diese Herausforderungen durch die Anwendung der Grundsätze der Persönlichkeitsentwicklung, wie Zielsetzung, Selbstmotivation, Zeitmanagement, und die Erarbeitung von einem hohen Selbstwertgefühl und einem Gefühl von Lebenssinn, besser bewältigen kann. 
Unsere Mission ist es,
Jugendliche zu helfen, diese Fähigkeiten zu entwickeln, so dass sie ihr volles
Potenzial erreichen können.                         
Wir wollen jungen Menschen helfen, sich jetzt Gedanken über ihre Zukunft zu machen. Wir wollen ihnen dabei helfen, ihre Talente und Begabungen zu entdecken, damit sie darauf aufbauen können. Wir wollen jungen Menschen beibringen wie sie ihre Probleme positiv und selbständig bewältigen können und erfolgreich werden, wobei Erfolg nicht nur als etwas Materielles gesehen werden kann.                                 Erfolgreich kann man im Beruf sein, in der Freizeit, in Beziehungen und in der eigenen, persönlichen Entwicklung. Wir wollen, dass es sich junge Menschen holen, das Glück am Haken.                           Erfolg im Leben hat nichts damit zu tun, wie intelligent man ist. Es hat nichts damit zu tun, woher man kommt, wo man aufwächst, oder in welche Schule man geht. Es geht nicht darum welche Klamotten man trägt und was andere von einem halten. Es gibt nur eines, was einen erfolgreichen jungen Menschen von anderen unterscheidet: Das wissen, das ich mein Leben verändern kann. Die persönliche Einstellung ist der Schlüssel zum Erfolg!                          
Wir wollen jungen Menschen
helfen, etwas zu erreichen. Wir wollen, dass sie ein Teil von etwas Grossem sind. Wir
wollen jungen Menschen helfen, unglaubliche Dinge zu vollbringen.
Dieses Buch birgt nur eine
Wahrheit: Jeder hat ein Talent. 
Dieses Buch zeigt jungen Menschen
wie sie:
1) Ihre Begabung entdecken
2) dieses Talent ausleben,
und
3) in ihrem Leben und im
Leben Anderer etwas bewirken in dem sie es sich holen, DAS
GLÜCK AM HAKEN

<p>Nepalese in Photography is a magazine conceptualized by group of youngsters after realizing Nepal does not have a photography magazine that focuses on trends, styles and different topics regarding photography. After starting Nepalese in Photography group in Facebook in 2007, we saw Nepali youth -- living in Nepal and abroad, are very much interested in photography and have been involved in it as a professional or as their passion. Our next move was to start a magazine that will focus on everything related to photography.</p>
<p>As soon as the idea was floated many interested in the project quit their job as journalists and designers in different organizations to come together and work on something that was closer to their heart. And it's not only the youth of Nepal but also some friends and Facebook page members from Australia are interested in the project and are getting involved in this magazine to make it a complete photography magazine.</p>
<p>Nepalese in Photography will not only cover various aspects of photography, but also will be a perfect platform to encourage and guide amateur photographers into the world of photography. As it is a new and one of its kind projects, it might take us a while to capture the market and bring in advertisement for our magazine. So for couple of months, we will be working without pay check, foundation grants, advisory boards or independently wealthy vanity investors—for now, at least.</p>
<p>To start a magazine is not easy but with passion towards writing and photography, brought together group of enthusiastic co founder, editors, reporters and photographers to give up their well paying salary and start working for this project. For next few months we will be focusing on bringing out a quality magazine with original articles, feature writings, interviews, and breath taking photo features.</p>
<p>We’re in the process of recruiting a diverse team of passionate contributors. </p>

Nepalese in Photography is a magazine conceptualized by group of youngsters after realizing Nepal does not have a photography magazine that focuses on trends, styles and different topics regarding photography. After starting Nepalese in Photography group in Facebook in 2007, we saw Nepali youth -- living in Nepal and abroad, are very much interested in photography and have been involved in it as a professional or as their passion. Our next move was to start a magazine that will focus on everything related to photography.
As soon as the idea was floated many interested in the project quit their job as journalists and designers in different organizations to come together and work on something that was closer to their heart. And it's not only the youth of Nepal but also some friends and Facebook page members from Australia are interested in the project and are getting involved in this magazine to make it a complete photography magazine.
Nepalese in Photography will not only cover various aspects of photography, but also will be a perfect platform to encourage and guide amateur photographers into the world of photography. As it is a new and one of its kind projects, it might take us a while to capture the market and bring in advertisement for our magazine. So for couple of months, we will be working without pay check, foundation grants, advisory boards or independently wealthy vanity investors—for now, at least.
To start a magazine is not easy but with passion towards writing and photography, brought together group of enthusiastic co founder, editors, reporters and photographers to give up their well paying salary and start working for this project. For next few months we will be focusing on bringing out a quality magazine with original articles, feature writings, interviews, and breath taking photo features.
We’re in the process of recruiting a diverse team of passionate contributors.

<p>“Embracing your wholeness is the greatest gift you can give to others. Being sustained fully as you are right now, leaves you empty of grasping to the world to fill yourself up. Being already full, you are free to just be yourself, as you are, moment by moment. When you don’t need anything from the world, or from other people, everything you do is service.” - Christine Wushke</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>You are invited to be part of the release of a powerful book on transformation being published by Inner Splendor Media in the fall of 2013.</p>
<p>Inner Splendor is a company that produces quality audio and video for yoga, meditation, relaxation and sleep aid. We are beginning to venture into publishing books and would like to invite you to be part of the journey.  </p>
<p>The book is called <em>Freedom is Your Nature: A Practical Guide to Transformation</em>. </p>
<p>This is an extraordinary new and important work on the inner journey written by Christine Wushke, a woman whose life has seen a series of classical spiritual encounters and experiences. In these pages, she shares with us her amazing revelations, their intoxicating sweetness, and their life-giving fruit.</p>
<p>But the book is more than the just the fascinating story of Christine’s own spiritual growth, for it unfolds for the reader a renewed understanding of life in general, accompanied by practical exercises that anyone can use to begin to change their own inner landscape — and with it — their outer world.</p>
<p>Using parables, stories, experiences, and insights from her meditations, she takes the reader on a double-decker journey: both hers and their own.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The book is already written and edited. The additional funding we seek is for the printing of the hardcover edition and for complementing our marketing and Public Relations budget.</p>
<p>For being part of the team, we are offering all sort of perks and extras. </p>
<p>The perks come at different levels and some include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Signed Edition of the hardcover book</li>
<li>Donation of books to individuals in prisons who are interested in meditation.</li>
<li>Audio and Video products for Yoga and Meditation</li>
<li>Limited Edition 11x14 C print.</li>
<li>An exclusive 6 week meditation course </li>
<li>One on one Skype sessions with Christine</li>
<li>And at the top levels we will have your name at the aknowledgments in the book or you can even be part of our next yoga and meditation retreat in Hawaii!</li>
</ul><p>The campaign will allow us to print the first 3,500 copies of the hardcover edition of the book and will contribute towards the cost of hiring a publicist and creating the website for the book.</p>
<p>Any amount helps us get to the goal!</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact</span></h3>
<p>We stand behind the content of the book and have experienced that the wisdom being shared works! This is information that needs to be properly shared with the world.</p>
<p>Inner Splendor has a solid record of delivering products that are uplifting in nature. We have released dozens of successful albums for our artists, including <em>Music For Deep Meditation</em>,<em> Music for Deep Sleep</em>, and <em>Splendor of Meditation</em>, some of which have been on the top charts for New Age and World Music. We also have several Yoga DVDs available.</p>
<p><em>Freedom is Your Nature</em> is already edited and laid out. We also have an edition in Spanish. We just need your help for the final push to get this beautiful work out into the world.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Other Ways You Can Help!</span></h3>

<h2><strong>Here is what people have said about the book:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>“Freedom is Your Nature is a simple and profound explanation of the teachings of yoga and how we can apply them to our lives. Read this book slowly and take time to digest each concept because they are all highly concentrated gems of wisdom.” - Desiree Rumbaugh<br/></strong></p>
<p>“An awakened Yogini is still a rarity these days when yoga is on everyone's lips, and Christine is certainly one of the rare ones” - Igor Kufayev<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>“Out of a hundred or so spiritual books read in 15 years, there's only two other authors - both world famous - that drove me back to re-read several times. Christine's <em>Freedom is Your Nature</em> is one of the simplest yet most effective books I have found. Through a compelling set of insights and techniques she helps me to better embody and live the consciousness that I am in my daily life; her teachings have impacted and made a substantial difference in my life.” – Giampaolo<br/></strong></p>
<p>""Christine Wushke beautifully explores one of the most compelling questions of life: How do we emerge from suffering and transform ourselves with real, encompassing wisdom and love? This book doesn't focus solely on turning inward for the elusive answers. Instead, she encourages us to find hope, healing and inspiration by connecting with her own experiences and practical applications. I found <em>Freedom is Your Nature</em> to be deeply personal, refreshing, and insightful."" - Sam Chahda, Owner, Yoga Elements Okotoks<strong><br/><br/></strong></p>

<p>As a photographer and a writer
we decided to combine our talents to create the <i>Meeting America</i> project.
We will be visiting 18 states ranging from Florida to New York and Texas to
Oregon. This trip will literally take us the breadth of the country. As we visit
each city and place on our list we will be interviewing and photographing the
interesting people we meet along the way asking questions like <b><i>What does the American dream mean to

be volunteering with charities at each stop. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/571023/files/20140510182009-Map.jpg?1399771209"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>The goal of Meeting America is to
present a realistic and moving portrait of the American people as a whole by
meeting people of different ages, races and social standing all over the
country.  However in order for this trip to happen we need your help. We
have three goals that we need to reach in order to visit everywhere we've

American citizens, moving here in 2003 from the United Kingdom and finally
receiving their citizenship this year! As new citizens of this amazing and
diverse country we really wanted to see all the unique and interesting places
in the United States. But more than that we want to truly get to know the
country that we have chosen to become a part of and the best way to do that is
through meeting Americans all over the country. And in turn discovering what it
truly means to be American. <p></p>
<p>The road trip (if all three rounds
are funded) will be a 45 day adventure to 18 states and 39 stops. These places
were chosen due to their cultural significance to the country as well being
spread out across very different landscapes. The trip will be about 10,000 miles
of roads starting in Orlando, FL, going to the south of Florida and all the way
up the east coast, across many mid states, to the west coast and back to
Florida. </p>
<p>Along the way we will be meeting
people at random restaurants, stores, festivals, museums and all the other
places we will stop along the way. We will interview people asking them what it
means to be American and then we will be taking a portrait of them to go along
with the interview. We are hoping to interview at least one person a day to give
ourselves a true sense of the sentiments of each place we go. We will also
interview an active servicemen or veteran in each state that we go, as they are
the American heroes.</p>
<p>Through these interviews and
portraits we will create a tapestry of images and quotes that represent the
breadth and diversity of this country.</p>
<p><b>What Makes it Unique </b></p>
<p>This trip is not just about us, it’s
about you and creating a project that people can be involved with. It’s an
interactive project. During the trip we want our supporters and followers to be
involved with shaping the trip. Followers will have voting rights and will get
daily/weekly emails. In these e-mails we will offers a few choices for what we
want to do in the city/place we are visiting as well as a couple of charities
we are considering volunteering with. It will then be up to our supporters to
vote on what we should do. Everyone will get a chance to be involved. We will
also have “spot the car” competitions where people can try snap the Meeting
America car and will get prizes and shout-outs on social media.</p>

<p>I want the world to know that this could be happening down your street, next door, or maybe even in your own house.</p>

<h3><strong>Last 5 Days Special Offer - All High Level Perks 1/2 Price </strong></h3>
<p><strong>I've dropped the price on the Alice Pack, Ramngefinder, NVG and Satchel Charge perks by half.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Survivors &amp; Bandits is a full length novel set in the world of DayZ. It’s a work of fiction that is a culmination of both my experiences and the experiences of people I’ve interviewed in DayZ. The first draft is currently at 95,000 words with the Act 1 sample provided coming in at 28,000 words – so it’s going to be big! I’ve been a writer for over seventeen years - writing novels, screenplays and television. This is my first Zombie fiction novel which my wife hopes will finally purge my constant discussions about the impending zombie apocalypse.</p>
<p>Cherno Journo is my DayZ ingame name and my pen name for this project. The Indiegogo sepcial edition pre-order version of Survivors &amp; Bandits will be unique to this campaign only. It will have additional content, such as transcripts of in-game interviews and my own Survivor diaries extracts, which any future release will not contain.</p>
<p>The eBook version of Survivors &amp; Bandits will be out before Christmas and will be a great gift for any DayZ fan. At this stage I can’t confirm a release date for the print versions as that will depend on contributor numbers and the printer’s deadlines. I know that if I wasn’t writing it I’d love it as a Christmas present so I’ll try my hardest to get all perks out for Christmas.</p>
<h2><strong>Samples</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>So hurry up and take my money</strong></h2>
<p>Woah, not so fast! I want to give you something for free first. I’ve worked with my editor of over ten years on the first Act of the novel. This sample I’m giving you for free - so read it and then decide if you like the project enough to pre-order. The links are at the top and in the next section and I’ve covered off all the major eBook formats. If there’s a different format you’d like then let me know and I’ll see if I can create it for you.</p>
<p>There are just three things to remember with the free sample;</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">- It’s only a draft so anything could change - although I do doubt it as the whole first draft novel is done, but the thing about DayZ is that it’s brutal. I might need to kill off existing characters and introduce some new characters.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> - It’s the first Act. There is a lot of getting to know the characters. If you don’t know them then you can’t care about them, so I need to give you their backstory. Lots of the action, the vehicles and the really messed up stuff that DayZ is known for occurs in the second and third Acts.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""> - It’s only the first 120 pages and full of spoilers. Act 1 ends on a small climax but the story is far from resolved and many questions are left unanswered. I recommend you read as much as you need to make a decision and then stop - save the surprises for your final read of the whole novel. This is even more important for the <strong>Character sheet</strong> which is spoiler city. Don't read that unless you've read the entire 120 pages. If you don’t want to know who lives and who dies, who betrays who and and who assists who, then don’t look at that sheet. The sheet is there for the contributors who want higher level perks, to provide them with more information and knowledge about which characters are still available.</p>

<p>The Wild Hunt is primary destination for those interested in following news relating and of interest to modern Pagan religions and other minority faiths. Founded by Jason Pitzl-Waters in 2004, The Wild Hunt has grown to become one of the most-visited and popular destinations exploring these topics. Recruited to Patheos.com in the Summer of 2011, The Wild Hunt decided to exist as an independent journalitic entity once more in the Summer of 2012. In addition, The Wild Hunt is now expanding into a media outlet with paid contributors and two paid staff members. </p>
<p>To make the dream of an independent Wild Hunt a reality, I need your help! </p>
</div>

<h3>A New Vision For Pagan Media</h3>
<p>While our interconnected community has proliferated with amazing media sources of all kinds, The Wild Hunt still inhabits a unique role and purpose: a mix of original reporting, insightful analysis, and a daily commitment to keeping you informed. Now, we would like do more, and do it in a way that honors the commitment of our community's writers and reporters. </p>
<p>In addition to the reporting of Wild Hunt founder Jason Pitzl-Waters, we will be using the funds raised here to pay two ongoing staff members, and pay for all future guest reporting and editorials, including reports from the Pagan Newswire Collective. </p>
<p>Here's how we'll spend that $6000 dollars:</p>
<p>$1000: Yearly Hosting Fee</p>

<p>This will, I believe, provide incentive to build better Pagan journalism, help train writers and reporters interested in emulating The Wild Hunt, and allow me (Jason) the time to write more in-depth journalism for our community. </p>
<p>But Jason, why aren't you being paid in this budget? Good question! If we happen to surpass our goal, I will budget a salary for myself, but I'm more concerned with buidling a new model for Pagan media and I'm willing to put my time, energy, and money, where my mouth is. If we succeed here, maybe we can do more, build more, expect more, from our Pagan media outlets. </p>

<h3>Why Should I Support The Wild Hunt? </h3>
<p>The Wild Hunt has a proven track record stretching over 8 years, and over those years we've become an essential news source and inspired many to create their own media. We've interviewed big-name Pagans like Margot Adler and Starhawk, reported on controversies and inspirational moments that have affected our community deeply, and acted as a watchdog when the mainstream media reports on modern Pagans and other minority faith traditions. However, the commitment, time, and energy needed to make this sustainable can only happen if you are willng to step forward and help us fund it. </p>
<p>Over the years many have said our community has a hard time supporting institutions and services that benefit them. I don't believe that. I think we can come together if something is worthwhile, and goes to the trouble to ask. I believe The Wild Hunt is giving something unique to our community, and I am asking you, please help us make this step into a new reality. Our success won't just be for us, it will be for you, and for those who follow us. </p>

“The Wild Hunt blog is a must-read for those interested in news and events dealing with the modern Pagan and Heathen communities – and religion coverage in general.” – M.Z. Hemingway, Get Religion


“…a source for smart commentary on a broad range of news, media, and ideas from a pagan perspective.” – Jeff Sharlet, author of “The Family: The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power”.

The Wild Hunt is primary destination for those interested in following news relating and of interest to modern Pagan religions and other minority faiths. Founded by Jason Pitzl-Waters in 2004, The Wild Hunt has grown to become one of the most-visited and popular destinations exploring these topics. Recruited to Patheos.com in the Summer of 2011, The Wild Hunt decided to exist as an independent journalitic entity once more in the Summer of 2012. In addition, The Wild Hunt is now expanding into a media outlet with paid contributors and two paid staff members. 
To make the dream of an independent Wild Hunt a reality, I need your help! 


A New Vision For Pagan Media
While our interconnected community has proliferated with amazing media sources of all kinds, The Wild Hunt still inhabits a unique role and purpose: a mix of original reporting, insightful analysis, and a daily commitment to keeping you informed. Now, we would like do more, and do it in a way that honors the commitment of our community's writers and reporters. 
In addition to the reporting of Wild Hunt founder Jason Pitzl-Waters, we will be using the funds raised here to pay two ongoing staff members, and pay for all future guest reporting and editorials, including reports from the Pagan Newswire Collective. 
Here's how we'll spend that $6000 dollars:
$1000: Yearly Hosting Fee
$1200: $100 per month for reporter Rynn Fox
$1200: $100 per month for reporter/columnist Heather Greene
$1200: $100 per month to run stories from the Pagan Newswire Collective
$1200: Yearly budget for guest posts from other writers.
$200: Fees and other expenses.
This will, I believe, provide incentive to build better Pagan journalism, help train writers and reporters interested in emulating The Wild Hunt, and allow me (Jason) the time to write more in-depth journalism for our community. 
But Jason, why aren't you being paid in this budget? Good question! If we happen to surpass our goal, I will budget a salary for myself, but I'm more concerned with buidling a new model for Pagan media and I'm willing to put my time, energy, and money, where my mouth is. If we succeed here, maybe we can do more, build more, expect more, from our Pagan media outlets.

<h3>A new horror anthology from <a href=""https://www.highdivepublishing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">High Dive Publishing</a>!!</h3>
<p>High Dive Publishing has wrangled 13 writers to create an incredible horror anthology. This Indiegogo campaign will serve as a pre-order to get YOUR copy of this hair-raising book, along with many other fun and frightening perks. Check out the perks, there are items and services for any budget.</p>
<p>But first, here’s the pitch for the book:<br/><i>A zombie outbreak at a community pool…<br/>A terrible secret at a school for children who can’t sleep…<br/>An actress who will do anything for fame…<br/>And more! </i></p>
<p><i>High Dive Publishing presents 12 spine tingling stories and 1 spooky poem to make you shiver in your board shorts. These tales are scary enough to frighten you in broad daylight while you watch the surf from your beach chair, or late at night when you’re nursing that sunburn. 13 writers have come together to create an anthology scarier than climbing the ladder to dive off the high diving board.<br/>Welcome to Horror From The High Dive!</i></p>

<h3>Why a horror anthology?</h3>
<p>Hey, Pete here!</p>

<p>I was raised on Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark and Goosebumps and Fear Street. I borrowed tattered copies of Stephen King collections from the New Carrolton Library. I sought out spookies of all sorts. Once I got it into my mind to do a horror anthology the idea beat at my brain's cellar door like a tell-tale heart.</p>
<p>So I set out to find 12 other writers to send me their scariest stuff. I wrote a story, collected 11 more stories, and got a wonderful introductory poem from another talented wordsmith. It took me literally a year, from October 2019 until now, to get the book just right and I can honestly say that this is an incredible selection of written works and I'm so excited for it to be out there!</p>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>
<p>Yasmine Watson's slogan is ""From Foster Care 2 Foster Mom"". Yasmine is a former foster child who is now a foster mom of four beautiful little girls, and the mother to many other children in here life. She is a small business owner that specializes in all natural skin care products. Yasmine's passion is working with youth and young adults in and out of foster care. After working as a teachers assistant at a private elementary school, she saw a void that she knew needed to be filled! That being teachings of African American Inventions. She also vowed to be the change she wanted to see in all areas of her life, and definitely when it came to having a wider diversity of African American Women Children's Books authors; as well as books that focused on African American characters. Her goal is to not only teach the youth about their history but to also build the confidence inside each and every one of them. </p>
<p>Yasmine was always eager to tap into the history that we unfortunately are not taught in school. If you were to ask 10 people, who invented the Kitchen Table, 8 out of 10 wouldn't know the answer, yet we eat at the kitchen table everyday. An African American man by the name of Henry Jackson invented the Kitchen Table. Yasmine wants to bring some excitement into the lives of children across the world. What's amazing about this book ""Well Now You Know"" is that it's not only educational for children, but also for adults as well.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This $15k will help with the production of the books and different items that will be sent out with each copy. We will be surprising 200 youth in foster care with their very own copy of the book for Christmas. Not only that, we will be taking it a step further by adding a gift box filled with things that most youth in foster care need. </p>
<ul>
<li>Socks</li>
<li>Under Clothes</li>
<li>Pajamas </li>
<li>Blankets </li>
</ul>
<p>&amp; Christmas would not be a success if they didn't have a toy to top it off!!! What is so amazing about this is that it will not only come as a surprise for the children, but also as a surprise for the foster agencies Yasmine will be donating to! </p>
<p>All money raised will be used as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>65% - Developing &amp; printing of Well Now You Know</li>
<li>25% -  Items needed box gift boxes</li>
<li>10% -  Packaging of each gift to be donated </li>
<li>You will also be able to write a personal note to a child you will be sponsoring, that will be added in each box donated.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> <strong>STATISTICS: </strong>As of Oct 1st, 2020, the State of Georgia has approximately 11,581 children in foster care. Many of these children do not receive gifts for the holidays. The sad part is, some have never even experienced what Christmas is like. Help us change that this Christmas! Know that you will be making a difference in a child's life. According to Kids &amp; Family Reading Report: Families expect more from children's book. Diversity in children's books is highly inclusive. Many children and parents want more diversity in books.  <strong>CHARACTERS BUILD CHARACTER.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Distribution: </strong>Our goal is to be in every household and every bookstore you can possibly think of. We want to have a presence in local books stores right in your back yard. We also would like to be in every elementary school that you can think of. We hope to partner with a book distributor that will help us reach our goal. We know that our goal of donating to 200 kids is kind of a stretch for a 45 day goal, but we know with the help of so many people like you reading this, that this is POSSIBLE and it will happen. </p>
<p><b>WORD OF MOUTH: </b>We know the impact that word of mouth can bring. In order for this dream of Yasmine's to be a success, we are asking that you tell a friend, to tell a friend, to tell a friend!!! We plan to also do local pop up shops with local businesses in the Atlanta, Ga, and surrounding areas. Although Covid-19 has stopped local schools from opening, we plan to do virtual readings and also fun challenges surrounding ""Well Now You Know""</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

What We Need & What You Get
This $15k will help with the production of the books and different items that will be sent out with each copy. We will be surprising 200 youth in foster care with their very own copy of the book for Christmas. Not only that, we will be taking it a step further by adding a gift box filled with things that most youth in foster care need. 

Socks
Under Clothes
Pajamas 
Blankets 

& Christmas would not be a success if they didn't have a toy to top it off!!! What is so amazing about this is that it will not only come as a surprise for the children, but also as a surprise for the foster agencies Yasmine will be donating to! 
All money raised will be used as follows:

65% - Developing & printing of Well Now You Know
25% -  Items needed box gift boxes
10% -  Packaging of each gift to be donated 
You will also be able to write a personal note to a child you will be sponsoring, that will be added in each box donated.


The Impact
 STATISTICS: As of Oct 1st, 2020, the State of Georgia has approximately 11,581 children in foster care. Many of these children do not receive gifts for the holidays. The sad part is, some have never even experienced what Christmas is like. Help us change that this Christmas! Know that you will be making a difference in a child's life. According to Kids & Family Reading Report: Families expect more from children's book. Diversity in children's books is highly inclusive. Many children and parents want more diversity in books.  CHARACTERS BUILD CHARACTER.
 

Risks & Challenges
Distribution: Our goal is to be in every household and every bookstore you can possibly think of. We want to have a presence in local books stores right in your back yard. We also would like to be in every elementary school that you can think of. We hope to partner with a book distributor that will help us reach our goal. We know that our goal of donating to 200 kids is kind of a stretch for a 45 day goal, but we know with the help of so many people like you reading this, that this is POSSIBLE and it will happen. 
WORD OF MOUTH: We know the impact that word of mouth can bring. In order for this dream of Yasmine's to be a success, we are asking that you tell a friend, to tell a friend, to tell a friend!!! We plan to also do local pop up shops with local businesses in the Atlanta, Ga, and surrounding areas. Although Covid-19 has stopped local schools from opening, we plan to do virtual readings and also fun challenges surrounding ""Well Now You Know""

<h2>Story of Our Book</h2>We are Maya Albert and Marik Hazan, the authors of <i>Our Trip Together</i>. We wrote this book because we felt the psychedelic ecosystem needed to be understood at a level deeper than just capitalism vs. activism, Western vs. Eastern, or clinical vs. indigenous.<br/><br/>Our hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the field of psychedelics is extremely complex not only in how it operates today, but the long-term externalities of rolling out compounds that change human consciousness on a massive scale. In this book, we hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that we have for understanding psychedelics on a deeper level. Ultimately, we want you to see this book as a tool to help you navigate the ups and downs of psychedelic development over the coming decades, develop a nuanced approach of engaging with the psychedelic ecosystem and those building it, and find ways in which to participate mindfully if you are called to this work.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the complexities of the psychedelic rollout today and the lessons we need to remember from the past. You’ll learn about how Israeli’s and Palestinians are drinking Ayahuasca together, and how Charles Manson used psychedelics to convince his followers to commit multiple murders. We’ll share stories of “Googler’s” microdosing LSD and how psychedelics were used in concentration camps during the holocaust. You'll learn about psychedelics for end of life care and about healers that are using tarot cards to conduct narrative therapy with these same compounds and plant medicines. You’ll see how these molecules will come to influence politics and business and how culture will transform at unprecedented rates over the next ten years.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are seeking to understand more about the global rollout of psychedelic medicines and therapeutics, are interested in how culture may change over the next decade as psychedelics become accessible, and some of the incredible work happening today all over the world to push psychedelics far past their ability to heal people with depression.<br/><br/><i>Our Trip Together</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to psychedelic guides, entrepreneurs, policy makers, investors, lawyers, activists, and organization builders who want to look at the growth of the psychedelic ecosystem in a new way.<br/> <h2>The Book - <i>Our Trip Together</i>
</h2>The book is written in 4 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-4. Section 1 is focused on laying the groundwork for psychedelic medicine and providing the reader with background on the most current research, science, and applications of psychedelic medicine. We prime the reader to begin thinking about the application of Psychedelic Assisted Therapy (PAT) to systems instead of individuals.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 5-8. Section 2 pushes the reader to dive further into what psychedelics can do with regards to changing geopolitical systems and explores lessons from the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s. We also review current policy both within the US, Canada, and internationally. Finally we discuss religious exemptions and provide predictions of how policy around psychedelics will evolve in the coming decades.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 9-12. Section 3 provides context on how business and psychedelics intersect. We cover the current markets, provide a perspective on the intersection of psychedelics and productivity, describe the innovative new businesses that are being created within the industry, and highlight alternative business models that are being adopted by the ecosystem.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> contains chapters 13-16. Section 4 closes out our text with discussions of psychedelics and media, culture, sustainability, religion, innovation, and community.<br/> <h2>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>

</ul>My name is Leia Baez, and I am the author of <i>A Star for Stella</i>. I wrote this book because I’ve personally experienced the power in storytelling and the positive impact you can have on others when you have the courage to be vulnerable and share your truth.<br/><br/>It has been a dream of mine since I was a little girl to write a book. I remember meeting an author at the Omaha Public Library in elementary school and thinking how cool it was that someone’s story was inside those pages.<br/><br/>I have always loved being a storyteller, too. As a former journalist at the Omaha World-Herald newspaper for roughly 14 years, I took great pride in sharing other people’s stories of inspiration and hope.<br/><br/>Now, I am sharing my own story in a memoir titled, <i>A Star for Stella: A Mother's Journey to Overcome &amp; Find Purpose in Pain.</i> I’m confident this book will help you wherever you are in your journey and be the motivation you need to keep going. I’m hopeful this book will lead you to the next step in being the best version of you. When you have the courage to face whatever is holding you back, that’s where your level up happens.<br/><br/><i>A Star for Stella</i> will take you through my journey to overcome a variety of obstacles. It’s a story of self-discovery, healing trauma, overcoming alcoholism, dealing with divorce and fighting to be the best version of me so I can be the best mother possible.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you admire a great comeback story. My story is a testament to “tough times don’t last, tough people do.”<br/><br/><i>A Star for Stella </i>speaks to mothers and anyone who has struggled with addiction, abuse or self-doubt. This memoir offers an uplifting story of perseverance for anyone who has failed or made a mistake and felt like life was over.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>A Star for Stella</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>How do we develop a positive mindset when we feel the world is against us?</li>
<li>What motivation do we need to pull out of the dark times?</li>
<li>How can we overcome an addiction to alcohol in a society where binge drinking is normalized?</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!<br/> </p>

Do you believe the hardest situations in life can actually lead to the most beautiful destinations?

A Star for Stella is the story of how one tragic night turned into years of self-discovery for a struggling mother.
Leia Baez’s eye-opening journey forces her to re-evaluate her life, her habits and the kind of role model she wants to be for her daughter.
Her testimony is proof that anything is possible with faith. Leia’s story exemplifies how traumatic situations can be used for good and growth.

As a former journalist at the Omaha World-Herald newspaper for roughly 14 years, I took great pride in sharing other people’s stories of inspiration and hope.Now, I am sharing my own story in a memoir titled, A Star for Stella: A Mother's Journey to Overcome & Find Purpose in Pain. I’m confident this book will help you wherever you are in your journey and be the motivation you need to keep going. I’m hopeful this book will lead you to the next step in being the best version of you. When you have the courage to face whatever is holding you back, that’s where your level up happens.A Star for Stella will take you through my journey to overcome a variety of obstacles. It’s a story of self-discovery, healing trauma, overcoming alcoholism, dealing with divorce and fighting to be the best version of me so I can be the best mother possible.You will love this book if you admire a great comeback story. My story is a testament to “tough times don’t last, tough people do.”A Star for Stella speaks to mothers and anyone who has struggled with addiction, abuse or self-doubt. This memoir offers an uplifting story of perseverance for anyone who has failed or made a mistake and felt like life was over.Ultimately, I hope that A Star for Stella inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
How do we develop a positive mindset when we feel the world is against us?
What motivation do we need to pull out of the dark times?
How can we overcome an addiction to alcohol in a society where binge drinking is normalized?

I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers! 


What We Need & What You'll Get

The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December, 2021.

The Cover Design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)

The Layout Design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).

The Copyediting for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.

The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this winter.
I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:
You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.
Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”).
You will receive early access to the Introduction and some excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.
You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and my subtitle.
You will be invited to join my ""Dream Team"" Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.

And much more! 

Campaign Goals 
The goal of this pre-order campaign is to sell at least 220 copies in 30 days in order for the author to hit Tier 3, which includes:

Tier 3: Hit $8,500 in pre-orders and get the ebook/softcover editions published as well as the hardcover and audiobook editions published.

International Preorders
For international preorders, please do the following:

Identify the perk that interests you, e.g. 1 or 2 paperbacks
Select the pink ""Back it"" button to ""Make a contribution"" for the same amount (this choice bypasses the shipping address page)
Use this form https://forms.gle/8GqJT2WGEQqzuNBMA to share your mailing address, so I can calculate the international shipping costs and invoice you for that amount via PayPal/Venmo



Risks & Challenges 
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.


Other Ways You Can Help
Not everyone can support, but that doesn't mean you can't get something out of it!I will reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days). Here's how:

At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit.)

Copy that link and paste it on your social media, email it to a friend, or text a fellow book lover.
When someone clicks on that link and backs the book, you get 1 entry!

</p><h2><b>Our Story:</b></h2>
<p>My name is Sharona Saltzman.
 As a mom, I wanted to make sure my daughter Shayna knew I was thinking
about her even when she was at school.  I tried using lunch notes I found
on the internet but Shayna found them all BORING!  So I decided to create
my own little daily notes that would make Shayna laugh and teach her something,
too. </p>
<p>After a while, Shayna and her
friends began looking forward to these clever little notes each day.  Some
days, the kids wouldn’t even wait until lunchtime to find out what the note of
the day was. This ignited the creation of the MyWish4U company and product
line.  I teamed up with another mom, graphic designer Hadas Propper, and
now our product line includes 6 colorfully illustrated 5"" x 5"" books
(101 unique  tear off notes in each) chock full of fun and interesting
information.  <br/></p><p></p><h2><br/></h2><h2><b>Lunch Notes From Me!</b></h2>

<h3>¿Que es Herederos de La Guerra de las Galaxias?</h3>
<div>

forma nueva de ver y disfrutar  el universo de <b>George

unidas. Las personas que se visten de los personajes de saga en los
eventos y las que crean esos eventos para que <i><b>Star

<p>
</p>
<p>Esta
exposición fotográfica, aunque tiene algunas buenas fotos, no
pretende ser una obra artística, sino más bien histórica, por un
lado, captadas de una forma espontánea, sin buscar la pose, y por
otro buscando una pose que no suele ser la habitual. Reflejan la
diversión, las ganas y los lugares donde  ha “olido” a <i>Star
Wars</i>. Es un homenaje a mis
amigos, a las asociaciones, a las personalidades del <b>“fandom”</b>
y a los que quieren pasar desapercibidos.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Aunque
los portada del libro, quizás parezca lo contrario, la importancia
de estas imágenes, es que las personas que se visten de personajes
con mascaras y cascos, dejen su timidez a un lado y se desprendan de
ese “poder” que les da la mascara. Es interesante, conocerlos,
quererlos y respetar el trabajo que hacen de forma desinteresada.
Además de enseñar los rostros que hay debajo, de todos esos
personajes tan emblemáticos, que han llenado nuestra imaginación,
quiero mostrar las caras de todas esas personas, que han estado o
siguen estando muy relacionadas con el universo y con los fans
españoles de <i>Star Wars</i>,

Es el limite de copias que The Force Group, cree que se hubiesen vendido en tiendas especializadas, incluyendo a las personas que aparecen fotografiadas en el interior de la obra, si lo hubiésemos podido autofinanciar nosotros.
Los mecenas de este proyecto tendrán ventajas como:

Recibir un ejemplar semanas antes de la salida al mercado de la obra.
Ver tu nombre e incluso tu foto en los agradecimientos aportando un poco más.

Los fondos recaudados, se utilizarán para sacar adelante esta edición limitada y numerada (e incluso firmada) de Herederos de la Guerra de las Galaxias que saldría pocas semanas después a la venta.
    El impacto



 Esta obra con posterioridad al envió de los ejemplares destinados a los mecenas, sera presentado y estará a la venta en Cificom 2015, Cosmic/Planeta Comic, Norma Comics y otras tiendas relacionadas con el Fandom de Star Wars   
Además...


Sabemos que son tiempos difíciles, también nosotros los sufrimos, y es posible que no te encuentres en disposición de apoyarnos con tu mecenazgo en estos momentos... pero esperamos que si esto te ha llegado al alma, incluso si tal vez conoces en persona al autor, trates de difundir esta campaña (facebook, twitter, blogs, boca-oreja... ) para que alcancemos nuestra meta y Jose Gracia vea publicada su obra. Gracias por vuestro tiempo.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign
